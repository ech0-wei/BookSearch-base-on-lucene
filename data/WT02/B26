<H2>Fact Sheet:  Insurance and Income </H2>
 
<H4>Copyright 1995 National Alliance for the Mentally Ill </H4>
 <HR>
The following information was taken from the Committee on Ways and Means, U.S. House of 
Representatives' "Overview of Entitlement Programs, 1994 Green Book: Background Material and Data 
on Programs within the Jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means," U.S. Government Printing 
Office, Washington, D.C., 1994 
 <P>
What is the Disability Insurance Program? 
 <P>
The Disability Insurance (DI) program provides monthly cash benefits for disabled workers under age 65 
and their dependents.  Benefits were provided to disabled workers age 50 or older by the 1956 Social 
Security amendments; benefits for their dependents were provided by the 1958 Social Security 
amendments; and benefits to disabled workers under age 50 were provided by the 1960 amendments. 
 <P>
In 1993, there were 5.2 million persons in current payment status.  Twenty-six percent were disabled by 
reason of mental illness.   
 <P>
Many provisions of the DI program are identical to those of the Old Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI), 
commonly referred to as Social Security.  The purpose of both OASI and DI benefits is to replace income 
lost when the wage-earner is no longer able to work.  The DI program insures against the loss of income 
due to the worker's physical or mental disability. 
 <P>
What is the definition of disability? 
 <P>
Generally, disability is defined as an inability to engage in substantial gainful activity by reason of a 
physical or mental impairment.  The impairment must be medically determinable and expected to last for 
not less than 12 months or to result in death.  
 <P>
Claimants may be determined to be disabled only if, due to such an impairment, they are unable to engage 
in any kind of substantial gainful work, considering their age, education, and work experience, which 
exists in the national economy.  The work need not exist in the immediate area in which the claimant 
lives, nor must a specific job vacancy exist for the individual.  Moreover, no showing is required that the 
worker would be hired for the job if he or she applied. 
 <P>
What are the DI benefits? 
 <P>
In general, DI monthly cash benefits are paid and computed on the same basis as in the OASI program.  
Benefit amounts are related to the past earning of the insured worker.  Medicare is provided to disabled 
workers, widow(er)s, or adult children after they have been entitled to disability benefits for 24 months.  
In December 1993 there were 5.2 million DI beneficiaries in current-payment status.  The total monthly 
benefits paid out were $2.6 billion.  Table 1 summarizes various types of beneficiaries of the DI program 
currently receiving benefits, average benefit amounts, and the number of new awards during 1993. 
 <P>
What are the major benefit types relevant to persons with mental illness? 
 <P>
The major benefit types include: 
 <P>
1.  Disabled-worker benefit -- A monthly benefit payable to  a disabled worker under age 65 insured for 
disability. 
 <P>
2.  Disabled adult child's benefit --  A monthly benefit payable  to a disabled person aged 18 or over--a son 
or daughter or eligible grandson or granddaughter of a retired, deceased, or disabled worker--whose 
disability began before age 22. 
 <P>
What is Supplemental Security Income? 
 <P>
The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is a means-tested, federally administered income 
assistance program authorized by title XVI of the Social Security Act.  Begun in 1974, SSI provides 
monthly cash payments in accordance with uniform, nationwide eligibility requirements to needy aged, 
blind, and disabled persons.  In 1993, nearly six million persons were receiving SSI.  Of these, 1,471,000 
(or 28.1 percent) were disabled by a mental disorder other than retardation. 
 <P>
What has been the trend in SSI recipients? 
 <P>
The number of recipients on SSI has risen from nearly 4 million in 1974 to nearly 6 million in December 
1993.  From 1984 through 1993, the disabled population on SSI grew at an annual average rate of about 
9.2 percent.  The monthly federal benefit rates for individuals and couples rose from $140 and $210 in 
1974 to $446 and $669 in 1994, respectively. 
 <P>
The proportion of SSI recipients receiving Social Security benefits declined from nearly 53 percent in 
1974 to about 40 percent in 1993.  The fraction of SSI recipients receiving some other type of unearned 
income rose from about 11 percent in 1974 to 13 percent in 1993, and the fraction with earnings jumped 
from about 3 percent to 1974 to more than 4 percent in December 1993. 
 <P>
What about children and SSI payments? 
 <P>
In June 1993, 732,000 blind and disabled children were eligible for SSI payments.  These children made 
up 12.6 percent of the over 5.8 million SSI recipients in June, and they represent a fast-growing segment 
of the SSI population.  
 <P>
To be eligible for SSI payments as a child, an individual must be under age 18 (or under 22 if he or she is 
a full-time student, unmarried, and must meet the SSI disability, citizenship/residency, and income and 
resources criteria (applicable to adults).  The Zabley Supreme Court decision required "individual 
functional assessments for children, not just conformity to one diagnosis in the adult listings. 
 <P>
In June 1993, almost 61 percent of the SSI children were 12 years old or less, and an estimated 20 percent 
of the children were under age 6.  About 28 percent (or about 199,000) were between the ages of 13 and 
17. 
 <P>
More than half (61 percent) of the SSI children were medically eligible based on a mental disorder, and 
most of these (43 percent) were mentally retarded.  The remaining 18 percent (61 minus 43)--or 131,760--
are eligible based on mental disorders other than retardation.

<H2>Campaign To End Discrimination Training Meeting Targets Parity</H2>
<hr>


	NAMI's Campaign to End Discrimination Against People with Brain Disorders has taken off.  In late March, 75 state campaign and media market coordinators met at the first state campaign coordinators training meeting in St. Louis, Missouri.  Each state-appointed coordinator is the contact for campaign activities and will work with the state AMI affiliate and local affiliates to get as many people as possible involved in the campaign.
<P>
	This year's goal is to introduce parity legislation in as many states as possible.  And while doing this, we will also educate legislators, insurers, and other persons and groups who need the facts about brain disorders and the justice of parity in health insurance.  Materials such as brochures, buttons, posters, mini-cards, and postcards are available to local affiliates that have planned parity activities.  (Your state coordinator will track activities.)
<P>
	To become involved in your state's activities and receive materials, contact your state office for the name of your state coordinator.  To learn more about the campaign, see the center insert in the last Advocate (March/April).

<HR>
<A NAME = "almos"><H2>ALMOST 25% HOMELESS ARE KIDS</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
Almost one quarter of homeless people in the United States are children, and they and their parents are the fastest-growing segment of the homeless population, according to an article on a recent study of homeless children in shelters in Los Angeles County.  Reported in the American Journal of Public Health (February 1994), this study found that few homeless children escaped emotional, behavioral, and academic problems and few received help for them. 
<P>
About 170 children were evaluated, and most parents in the study (93 percent) were minority women living in extreme poverty (annual income under $10,000).  More than a third (37 percent) of the children had depression scores high enough to warrant a psychiatric evaluation, and more than a quarter (28 percent) were in the borderline range for serious behavioral problems. 
<P>
Few of the children were receiving any treatment; and among those depressed enough to warrant psychiatric evaluation, only about one-quarter (30 percent) had ever received counseling.  The researchers suggest that mental health and education services should be part of a comprehensive package of services for homeless children.   

<P>
<A NAME = "planf"><H2>PLAN FOR SINGLE HOUSING PROGRAM</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
Advocates for housing for people with severe mental illness should be alert to a significant change in the way monies from certain key federal housing programs will be administered and awarded at local levels.  
<P>
Under the "Consolidated Plan" recommended by HUD and approved by Congress, four distinct housing and community development funding streams have been combined into one massive program.  These four programs are the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME, Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG) and Housing Opportunities for People with Aids (HOPWA). 
<P>
Authority will be vested in local communities to develop one consolidated plan to identify priorities for spending monies from this large new program.  Communities will be required to hold public hearings and seek input from local advocates as they develop these plans.  Local Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) plans have been eliminated and folded into this larger planning process. 
<P>
The new consolidated planning process is potentially problematic in that it creates possible competition for these federal monies among a large number of advocates for various low-income interests.  However, it also creates opportunities for advocates on behalf of housing for people with severe mental illness to be at the table when crucial planning and funding decisions occur. 
<P>
Historically, in many local jurisdictions, little money from the four programs included in the consolidation have been used for housing for people with severe mental illness. 
<P>
During the recently completed session, Congress also considered legislation that would have consolidated all funding streams within the McKinney Act into one large block grant.  This legislation did not pass, but it is expected to be taken up again when the new Congress reconvenes.
<P>
Information about local consolidated planning processes should be available from low-income housing advocates in your communities.  NAMI housing advocates are urged to participate in the development of these plans.  Additional information about the Consolidated Plan and the possible creation of a McKinney block grant will be provided in a future issue of the NAMI Advocate.

<H2>Congress Appropriates Additional Funding For Housing</H2>
<H4>by Andrew Sperling, NAMI Director Of Public Policy
</H4>
</font>
<hr>

	As part of the recently enacted 1997 budget for the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Congress began 
the process of funding replacement housing resources for people 
with disabilities who are likely to be harmed by recent changes in 
the law that allows an increase in "elderly only" housing 
designations.  For fiscal year 1997, Congress appropriated $50 
million for tenant-based rental assistance for people with 
disabilities who are adversely affected by "elderly only" housing 
designations.
<P>
	As a result of Congressional changes enacted in 1992 and 
expanded in 1996, public-housing authorities (PHAs) and assisted-
housing providers now have tremendous freedom to exclude non-
elderly people with disabilities by designating buildings and 
developments as "elderly only."  Such "elderly only" housing 
designations are expected to have a devastating impact on the 
availability of decent, safe, and affordable housing for people 
with disabilities.  While the law does contain certain protections 
for current lease-compliant tenants, people with disabilities on 
public and assisted-housing waiting lists are particularly 
vulnerable--especially people with severe and persistent mental 
illness who already face stigma and discrimination both in public 
housing and the private rental market.  This erosion of housing 
resources is compounded by recently enacted changes that repeal 
federal preferences in tenant-selection policies and place tight 
restrictions on eligibility for individuals with a history of 
substance abuse.
<P>
	The Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) housing 
task force estimates that by the year 2000 there will be a decrease 
of at least 273,000 units that would otherwise have been occupied 
by non-elderly people with disabilities in the absence of "elderly 
only" housing designations.  This $50-million allocation (estimated 
to fund as many as 10,000 one-year certificates and vouchers) will 
not come close to meeting the increase in demand for affordable 
housing expected over the next few years.  However, it does amount 
to the first time that Congress has recognized the need to make 
replacement resources available for the disability community.  The 
$50-million appropriation was included in the HUD budget through 
the efforts of Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-NJ) and 
Senators Pete Domenici (R-NM) and John Kerry (D-MA).   
<P>
	Even with this modest infusion of new resources, the public 
mental health system is likely to face greater difficulty trying to 
cope with the loss of affordable housing.  As Congress moves to 
devolve responsibilities for housing programs to state and local 
governments, state mental health agencies (SMHAs) and local mental 
health authorities will need to intervene with state housing-
finance agencies and PHAs at the community level to ensure that 
people with brain disorders have a voice in local planning 
decisions.  
<P>
	While the 104th Congress did not follow through on proposals 
to abolish HUD as a federal agency, the department's budget was cut 
by nearly 20 percent (down to $20 billion).  In addition, other 
important changes were made that have moved the federal government 
almost completely out of the business of producing new housing 
units and further away from any role supervising how federal funds 
are allocated at the local level.  Thus, these modest increases in 
funding for housing for people with disabilities are an important 
accomplishment for disability advocates. 
<P>
	The expanded authority for PHAs to designate housing as 
"elderly only" was contained in a bill signed by President Clinton 
in March 1996 extending the authority for certain expiring HUD 
programs.  A separate bill reforming public housing programs by 
converting numerous federal programs into block grants died in a 
House-Senate conference committee immediately prior to final 
adjournment.  Nevertheless, the next Congress is expected to 
continue to push toward consolidating federal housing programs and 
passing the responsibility for housing policy down to state and 
local government.  For example, homeless-service programs under the 
McKinney Act are likely to be block-granted and could be cut below 
their current level of $823 million (after having been cut by 
nearly $300 million over the past two years).  
<P>
	Another important program serving the housing needs of people 
with brain disorders is Section 811.  Since 1994, the Section 811 
program has been cut by nearly $40 million, down to its current 
level of $194 million.  (The Section 811 program funds capital 
advances and project-based certificates for non-profit groups that 
serve the housing needs of people with disabilities.)  Congress 
also granted HUD new authority to transfer up to 25 percent of the 
funds appropriated under the 811 program to tenant-based rental 
assistance.  This change is designed to allow HUD to fund roughly 
the same number of units (2,915) as it did in 1995 and 1996.       
<P>
 	While these new housing resources for people with disabilities 
are a positive development, the long-term trend for solutions at 
the federal level is not encouraging.  As with all other 
discretionary programs within the federal budget, HUD funding will 
be facing severe constraints over the next five to seven years.  
If, as expected, the HUD budget is further squeezed between now and 
the year 2000, responses to the housing crisis facing people with 
disabilities will have to come through creative approaches at all 
levels.  
<P>
	Beyond Section 811 and Section 8 certificates and vouchers for 
people with disabilities, there are other federal resources that 
SMHAs and local mental health authorities can tap.  The Low-income 
Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) and the Community Development Block 
Grant (CDBG) programs both enjoy broad bipartisan support in 
Congress, and their funding is likely to remain stable.  Both 
programs are administered by state housing finance authorities and 
state and local economic development agencies rather than by HUD.  
Thus, SMHAs and their allies in the provider community as well as 
families and consumers can play an important role in deciding how 
these resources are spent at the community level.  State and local 
officials that administer programs such as LIHTC and CDBG must go 
through a planning process and a local housing assessment that 
require a survey of the housing needs of people with disabilities 
and input from concerned parties.  Proactive engagement on the part 
of the entire mental health community with state housing finance 
authorities and local economic development officials will help 
ensure that resources keep pace with increased demand for housing. 
<P>
    	Finally, the public mental health system must look toward 
creative solutions at the local level and through partnerships with 
the private sector.  Increasingly, managed care firms that have won 
contracts to serve clients in the public mental health system are 
investing resources in community-based housing.  While some states 
have included housing or residential services in contracts, many 
managed care firms view access to decent, safe, and affordable 
housing as an important part of preventing expensive inpatient 
hospitalization.

<H2>VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES</H2>
<P>
<hr>
A number of NAMI members use the Department of Veterans Affairs
[VA] and/or military facilities for psychiatric care for themselves
or a family member.  Since 1989 NAMI has advocated on behalf of
these populations because they are often not included in the overall
civilian planning and development of community-based treatment
and services for which they, as citizens, ought to be eligible.
<P>
What are some examples of how NAMI advocates on behalf  of veterans,
active-duty military, and/or their dependents with severe mental
illness?
<P>
--In 1990 NAMI's alert helped reverse the congressional decision
to cut $800,000,000 in psychiatric care for dependents of active-duty
military.
<P>
--In 1991 NAMI supported the Disabled American Veterans [DAV]
class-action lawsuit to restore $125,000,000 for 13,500 &quot;incompetent
veterans.&quot;
<P>
--Since 1994 NAMI has had representatives on the VA Undersecretary
for Health's Special Committee for the Seriously Mentally Ill
Veteran.
<P>
--Since 1994 NAMI has sent presenters to the VA National Training
Program continuing education workshops [&quot;Strengthening Systems
for the Primary Care of Veterans with Psychiatric Disorders&quot;].
<P>
--Each year NAMI provides expert testimony at congressional committee
hearings regarding veterans with serious mental illness.
<P>
What can NAMI do to help a veteran and his family?
<P>
NAMI can provide expertise in developing a family support group
at your local Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center.
<P>
NAMI can provide the latest data about serious mental illness
and serve as an information clearinghouse.
<P>
NAMI's Homeless and Missing service can assist families of the
200,000 homeless veterans with chronic mental illness.
<P>
I am a veteran. How can I or my family get help for my medical
problems?
<P>
Medical care (including psychiatric care) is just one of 
<P>
the many benefits and services to which a veteran may 
<P>
be entitled. However, the federal government does not grant veteran's
benefits automatically. You must apply for them. Eligibility must
be verified and justified.
<P>
How do I become eligible for medical care?
<P>
Consult your local telephone directory under United States Government,
Department of Veterans Affairs, for the number to reach a VA representative.
 Toll-free telephone service is available in all 50 states, Washington
D.C., and Puerto Rico.
<P>
You must supply information that you were honorably discharged
(Form DD-214).  You must complete a financial statement (a financial
means test) for the past year.  This statement will be audited
by the IRS.
<P>
Upon verification of your discharge status and financial status,
you should qualify for inpatient and outpatient medical care.
 Note, however, that not all benefits may be available to you
if you enlisted for the first time on or after September 8, 1980,
and have not completed at least two years of that enlistment.
 For officers, the two year requirement applies on or after October
17, 1981.
<P>
My psychiatric disorder began while I was on active duty.  Am
I eligible for financial compensation in addition to VA medical
care?
<P>
VA pays compensation if you are disabled by injury or disease
incurred in or aggravated by active service in the line of duty.
 Payments are based on the degree of disability.  VA pays additional
money for your dependents if your service-connected disabilities
are evaluated as 30 percent or more disabling. 
<P>
In addition, if you are 30 percent or more disabled and your spouse
is in need of regular aid, an increased dependency allowance is
payable for your spouse.  Remember--getting service-connected
compensation  (or a nonservice-connected pension) can be a difficult
and complicated process. 
<P>
Qualifying for VA medical care does not automatically qualify
you for financial compensation or pension.  When in doubt, apply!
 You may want to get a representative (see below) to assist you
in applying for these benefits.  A rating as low as 10 percent
may qualify for financial benefits.
<P>
All service-connected veterans rated 50 percent or higher and
low-income nonservice-connected veterans are eligible for free
inpatient and outpatient care at VA medical centers and clinics.
 If VA facilities and resources are available, VA may provide
medical care for higher-income nonservice-connected veterans.
 They will be billed $39/outpatient visit; $719 per inpatient
admission; plus $10/day nursing care.  Check with your VA medical
center to see if this care is available.
<P>
Where can I go to get someone to represent me in applying for
financial benefits?
<P>
NAMI in the past has worked closely with the Disabled American
Veterans [DAV] organization.  DAV is independent of the federal
government.  DAV will help you file your claim for benefits by
building your case from the ground up--reviewing all pertinent
laws, regulations, precedents, and medical histories. 
<P>
DAV prepares claim forms and briefs.  They help you assemble the
required paperwork.  If necessary, DAV will represent you before
government boards.  They also review government decisions, take
appropriate action, and advise you if appeals are warranted.
<P>
Remember--NAMI does not have staff trained to provide this comprehensive
representation.  While we are confident in recommending DAV, there
are a number of other veterans' service organizations [VSOs] which
will represent you without charge:  AMVETS, American Legion, Veterans
of Foreign Wars, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and others.  NAMI
can consult with your representative to provide expertise about
mental illness.
<P>
I have lost my military discharge papers.  How can I get duplicate
copies?
<P>
Contact the VA to see if your records are on file.  If not, the
VA or your VSO representative can provide the form to help you
obtain records from National Personnel Records Center/Military
Personnel Records/9700 Page Boulevard/St. Louis MO 63132-5100
<P>
How can I contact a veterans' service organization [VSO]?
<P>
Call your local VA representative, your state/county veterans'
office, or contact:

<A NAME = "highe"><H2>HIGHER RATES OF DEPRESSION IN WOMEN</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
Higher rates of depression observed in women may be linked to differences in biochemistry and childhood socialization that render some women more vulnerable than men to the illness, according to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).  The NIMH study and other research was reported in a special November 1993 issue of the Journal of Affective Disorders devoted to women and depression.
<P>
"Research into the biological and psychological underpinnings of depression is beginning to yield findings that help to explain why women are twice as likely to develop depression," said former NIMH Director Frederick K. Goodwin, M.D.  "As we learn more about gender-specific factors in the development of depression, we will be better able to design specialized and more effective treatments for both women and men with the disorder.
<P>
Findings reported in this issue of the Journal of Affective Disorders are reported below.
<P>
Dr. Myrna M. Weissman of Columbia University's New York State Psychiatric Institute and colleagues examined sex differences in the rates of depressive illnesses in the United States, Canada, Germany, and New Zealand. 
<P>
Across the four countries, they found almost the same rates of bipolar (manic-depressive) disorder in men and women, but higher rates of major depression and dysthymia in women.  Major depression first strikes in the mid- to late-20s for both sexes, and while the rate of depression in the United States in men born since 1945 has been rising, it appears to have stabilized in women.
<P>
In research on biological mechanisms underlying depression, Dr. Uriel Halbreich and Lucille A. Lumley, M.S., both of the State University of New York at Buffalo, compared neurochemical and neuroendocrine function in men and women. 
<P>
They found gender differences in several functions of the norepinephrine and serotonin neurotransmitter systems, in activities of dopamine and acetylcholine, and in certain operations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system. 
<P>
These findings suggest that vulnerability to depression, as well as its actual expression, might be related to short- and long-term effects of gonadal hormones.  These hormones probably play an important role in the multi-faceted and multi-dimensional mechanisms underlying mood and behavior.
<P>
Dr. Diane N. Ruble of the New York University and colleagues, in a literature review of socialization processes in childhood, discussed various social factors that may lead to girls' greater vulnerability to depression.  For example, girls are usually more closely watched and protected than boys, making them less likely to develop an independent sense of mastery. 
<P>
This low sense of self-efficacy, the researchers reported, may lead to feelings of little control, pessimism, and hopelessness.  Theorists of learned helplessness believe all of these are related to the development of depression.  This review also suggested that pre-pubertal girls sometimes have more depressive symptoms than boys. 
<P>
This finding supports the view that women's higher rates of depression cannot be solely explained by hormone-related changes associated with the onset of puberty.  This is important because it suggests that prevention and intervention efforts should be directed at socialization processes during the early school years.
<P>
Dr. Ronald Kessler of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and colleagues reported that there is no difference between the sexes in the overall course of depression once it occurs.  Men and women who had a history of depression were equally likely to have been chronically depressed or to have experienced an acute recurrence of a depressive episode in the past year. 
<P>
This finding comes from the National Comorbidity Survey, which was conducted in the United States from 1990 to 1992 and involved nearly 8,100 respondents.
<P>
Title and authors of some of the other articles in this special journal issue include:  "Do gonadal steroids regulate circadian rhythms in humans," by Dr. Ellen Leibenluft, NIMH; "Gender differences in depression: perspectives from neuropsychology," by Dr. Wendy Heller, University of Illinois; "Puberty onset of gender differences in rates of depression:
<P>
A developmental, epidemiologic and neuroendocrine perspective," by Dr. Adrian Angold, Duke University Medical Center, and Dr. Carol W. Worthman, Emory University; "The menstrual cycle and mood disorders," by Dr. Jean Endicott, New York State Psychiatric Institute.

<A NAME = "brain"><H2>BRAIN DONATIONS</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
THE HARVARD PSYCHIATRY BRAIN COLLECTION
<p>
        The Harvard Psychiatry Brain Collection has been specifically
trying to collect brain tissue from families with serious mental illness.
There has been a special focus on the membership of the National Alliance
for the Mentally Ill (NAMI), the organization for families with brain
disorders.  Our "Brain Bank" functions as a repository for brain tissue
that is used for scientific investigations of the underlying causes of
neuropsychiatric brain disorders.  Toward this end,  we distribute donated
tissue to qualified investigators throughout the country.
 <p>       For research purposes, it is important that we collect tissue from:
A. Individuals with a psychiatric diagnosis (schizophrenia,
manic-depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder);  B.  First degree
relatives (parents, siblings, offspring) of individuals with a psychiatric
diagnosis; and C. "Normal Control" individuals who have no family history
of mental illness.
  <p>      The Harvard "Brain Bank", which is centered at McLean Hospital, is
federally funded to undertake the processing and distribution of donated
brain specimens.  Unfortunately, the government does not provide sufficient
funding to cover the costs associated with brain removal which, may in some
cases be as much as $200-300.  In the past, these costs have generally been
assumed by the family members interested in brain donation.  However,
because of the severe shortage of brain tissue donated by individuals with
a serious psychiatric illness, we have established a special fund in order
to cover the costs of brain removal for individuals with a psychiatric
diagnosis (category A above).  In addition, as long as there is adequate
funding available, we will also cover such costs for the donation of brains
from first degree relatives (parents, sibling, offspring) of individuals
with schizophrenia, manic-depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder
(category B above).  The spouse of an individual with a serious mental
illness, who has no other blood relatives with a serious mental illness,
can donate brain tissue in the category of "Normal Control" (category C
above), and as long as there is adequate funding available, we will agree
to cover the associated costs of donation.
  <p>      Pre-registration for brain donation is encouraged, but not
necessary.  When an individual dies, the surviving family members make the
decision to donate.  We do, however, encourage families to openly plan for
brain donation and to pre-register with the Brain Bank.
   <p>     Brain donation is a personal decision that is made by the surviving
family at the time of death.  In the event of a death, or an impending
death, just dial     1-800-BRAIN BANK any time of the day or night and our
staff will assist you in the donation process.
    <p>    For more information about brain donation, please call 1-800-BRAIN
BANK (1-800-272-4622) and request our "Brain Donation Information"
brochures for your Local Affiliate meeting or a copy of our free video
interview with Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor titled "LifeSpan: Research Takes
Brains".

<A NAME = "study"><H2>STUDY FINDS AFTERCARE LACKING</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
A national study of psychiatric aftercare has found that patients leaving psychiatric hospitals often receive inadequate or uneven transitional services.  "Because psychiatric care has increasingly been provided in community-based settings rather than in hospitals, there must be greater coordination between hospitals discharging patients and the local mental health centers and clinics providing care after they leave," said Dr. Robert Dorwart, a co-author of the study published in the August 1994 issue of the American Journal of Public Health. 
<P>
 "Right now they are falling through the cracks," he continued.  The Harvard-based study funded by the National Institute of Mental Health found that half of the facilities surveyed provided patient follow-up of one week or less.  While nine out of ten hospitals reported making discharge plans for patients leaving the hospital, 75 percent provided no case-management services, the most intensive form of aftercare. 
<P>
And although 60 percent of hospitals said they arranged a follow-up appointment for patients leaving the hospital, just 10 percent made telephone calls to see if the appointment was kept.  For more information, contact Dr. Dorwart at 617/495-0868.
<P>


<A NAME = "viole"><H2>VIOLENCE AND THE MENTALLY ILL</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
"The perceived association between violent behavior and serious mental illness was explored to determine the validity of claims by mental health advocates that individuals with serious mental illness are no more dangerous than members of the general population," wrote E. Fuller Torrey, M.D., in conjunction with his article, "Violent Behavior by Individuals with Serious Mental Illness," published in the July 1994 issue of Hospital and Community Psychiatry. 
<P>
Torrey reviewed recent studies and media accounts of violent behavior by individuals with serious mental illness and found that "although the vast majority of [such individuals] are not more dangerous than members of the general population, recent findings suggest the existence of a subgroup that is more dangerous. 
<P>
A history of violent behavior, noncompliance with medications, and substance abuse are important predictors of violent behavior in this subgroup....Until the problem of violence by this subgroup is addressed, it will be difficult to substantially decrease the stigma associated with serious mental illness," concluded Torrey.

<H2>Fact Sheet:  Insurance And Income</H2>
<HR>
The following information was taken from the Committee on Ways
and Means, U.S. House of Representatives' &quot;Overview of Entitlement
Programs, 1994 Green Book: Background Material and Data on Programs
within the Jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means,&quot;
U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., 1994
<P>
What is the Disability Insurance Program?
<P>
The Disability Insurance (DI) program provides monthly cash benefits
for disabled workers under age 65 and their dependents.  Benefits
were provided to disabled workers age 50 or older by the 1956
Social Security amendments; benefits for their dependents were
provided by the 1958 Social Security amendments; and benefits
to disabled workers under age 50 were provided by the 1960 amendments.
<P>
In 1993, there were 5.2 million persons in current payment status.
 Twenty-six percent were disabled by reason of mental illness.
 
<P>
Many provisions of the DI program are identical to those of the
Old Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI), commonly referred to as
Social Security.  The purpose of both OASI and DI benefits is
to replace income lost when the wage-earner is no longer able
to work.  The DI program insures against the loss of income due
to the worker's physical or mental disability.
<P>
What is the definition of disability?
<P>
Generally, disability is defined as an inability to engage in
substantial gainful activity by reason of a physical or mental
impairment.  The impairment must be medically determinable and
expected to last for not less than 12 months or to result in death.

<P>
Claimants may be determined to be disabled only if, due to such
an impairment, they are unable to engage in any kind of substantial
gainful work, considering their age, education, and work experience,
which exists in the national economy.  The work need not exist
in the immediate area in which the claimant lives, nor must a
specific job vacancy exist for the individual.  Moreover, no showing
is required that the worker would be hired for the job if he or
she applied.
<P>
What are the DI benefits?
<P>
In general, DI monthly cash benefits are paid and computed on
the same basis as in the OASI program.  Benefit amounts are related
to the past earning of the insured worker.  Medicare is provided
to disabled workers, widow(er)s, or adult children after they
have been entitled to disability benefits for 24 months.  In December
1993 there were 5.2 million DI beneficiaries in current-payment
status.  The total monthly benefits paid out were $2.6 billion.
 Table 1 summarizes various types of beneficiaries of the DI program
currently receiving benefits, average benefit amounts, and the
number of new awards during 1993.
<P>
What are the major benefit types relevant to persons with mental
illness?
<P>
The major benefit types include:
<P>
1.  Disabled-worker benefit -- A monthly benefit payable to  a
disabled worker under age 65 insured for disability.
<P>
2.  Disabled adult child's benefit --  A monthly benefit payable
 to a disabled person aged 18 or over--a son or daughter or eligible
grandson or granddaughter of a retired, deceased, or disabled
worker--whose disability began before age 22.
<P>
What is Supplemental Security Income?
<P>
The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is a means-tested,
federally administered income assistance program authorized by
title XVI of the Social Security Act.  Begun in 1974, SSI provides
monthly cash payments in accordance with uniform, nationwide eligibility
requirements to needy aged, blind, and disabled persons.  In 1993,
nearly six million persons were receiving SSI.  Of these, 1,471,000
(or 28.1 percent) were disabled by a mental disorder other than
retardation.
<P>
What has been the trend in SSI recipients?
<P>
The number of recipients on SSI has risen from nearly 4 million
in 1974 to nearly 6 million in December 1993.  From 1984 through
1993, the disabled population on SSI grew at an annual average
rate of about 9.2 percent.  The monthly federal benefit rates
for individuals and couples rose from $140 and $210 in 1974 to
$446 and $669 in 1994, respectively.
<P>
The proportion of SSI recipients receiving Social Security benefits
declined from nearly 53 percent in 1974 to about 40 percent in
1993.  The fraction of SSI recipients receiving some other type
of unearned income rose from about 11 percent in 1974 to 13 percent
in 1993, and the fraction with earnings jumped from about 3 percent
to 1974 to more than 4 percent in December 1993.
<P>
What about children and SSI payments?
<P>
In June 1993, 732,000 blind and disabled children were eligible
for SSI payments.  These children made up 12.6 percent of the
over 5.8 million SSI recipients in June, and they represent a
fast-growing segment of the SSI population. 
<P>
To be eligible for SSI payments as a child, an individual must
be under age 18 (or under 22 if he or she is a full-time student,
unmarried, and must meet the SSI disability, citizenship/residency,
and income and resources criteria (applicable to adults).  The
Zabley Supreme Court decision required &quot;individual functional
assessments for children, not just conformity to one diagnosis
in the adult listings.
<P>
In June 1993, almost 61 percent of the SSI children were 12 years
old or less, and an estimated 20 percent of the children were
under age 6.  About 28 percent (or about 199,000) were between
the ages of 13 and 17.
<P>
More than half (61 percent) of the SSI children were medically
eligible based on a mental disorder, and most of these (43 percent)
were mentally retarded.  The remaining 18 percent (61 minus 43)--or
131,760--are eligible based on mental disorders other than retardation.

<H2>Estimates of "Mental Illness" Prevalence</H2>
<hr>



	The Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) has issued an 
estimate of the adult population in the U.S. with serious mental 
Illness:  11.4 million, or 5.7 percent of the total population.  
<P>
	According to Ronald Manderscheid, Ph. D., chief of CMHS's 
Survey and Analysis Branch, federal statistics now cite three 
separate prevalence estimates for adult mental illness:  5.4 
million people with a "severe and persistent" mental illness (2.7 
percent of the population); 11.4 million people with a severe 
mental illness (5.7 percent of the population); and 48.2 million 
people with any diagnosable (via DSM-III-R) mental disorder in a 
one-year period (24.1 percent of the population).

<H2>Involuntary Commitment And Court-Ordered Treatment</H2>
<hr>
The following message is from Rona Purdy, NAMI president, and Mary Ellen Rehrman, chair, Public Policy & Communications Committee.
<P>
	We are reporting that, after a great deal of study, the NAMI Board of Directors has approved a policy on involuntary commitment and court-ordered treatment.  This policy was developed after a year of analysis with input from grassroots members around the country.  The final text, approved by the board, is printed below.
<P>	In passing this policy, the board re-emphasized its belief that "the availability of effective, comprehensive, community-based systmes of care for persons suffering from brain disorders will diminish the need for involuntary commitment and court-ordered treatment."  We also agree that court-ordered treatment should only be used as a "last resort."  On the other hand, the board is cognizant of the fact "that there are certain individuals with brain disorders who at times, due to their illness, lack insight or judgment about their need for medical treatment."  We believe the following policy does a good job of balancing an individual's civil rights with society's obligation to provide kind and compassionate care to those in need.

<P>

<H3>Policy On Involuntary Commitment And Court Ordered Treatment</H3>

<H4>Approved by NAMI Board of Directors on October 7,1995</H4>


	The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) believes that all people should have the right to make their own decisions about medical treatment.  However, NAMI is aware that there are certain individuals with brain disorders (also known as severe mental illnesses) such as schizophrenia and manic-depressive illness who, at times, due to their illness, lack insight or judgement about their need for medical treatment.  NAMI is also aware that, in many states, laws and policies governing involuntary commitment and/or court-ordered treatment are inadequate. 
<P>
	NAMI, therefore, adopts the following policy:
<UL>
1.	The availability of effective, comprehensive community-based systems of care for persons suffering from biological brain disorders will diminish the need for involuntary commitment and/or court-ordered treatment. <P>
2.	Methods for facilitating communications about treatment preferences among individuals with biological brain disorders, family members, and treatment providers should be adopted and promoted in all states.<P>
3.	Involuntary commitment and court-ordered treatment decisions must be made expeditiously and simultaneously in a single hearing so that individuals can receive treatment in a timely manner.  The role of courts should be limited to review to ensure that procedures used in making these determinations comply with individual rights and due process requirements, and not to make medical decisions. <P>
4.	Involuntary inpatient and outpatient commitment and court-ordered treatment should be used as a last resort and only when it is believed to be in the best interests of the individual in need.   5.States should adopt broader, more flexible standards that would provide for involuntary commitment and/or court-ordered treatment when an individual: <P><UL>
		(A).	Is gravely disabled, which means that the person is substantially unable, except for reasons of indigence, to provide for any of his or her basic needs, such as food, clothing, shelter, health or safety, or<P>
		(B).	Is likely to substantially deteriorate if not provided with timely treatment, or<P>
		(C).	Lacks capacity, which means that as a result of the brain disorder the person is unable to fully understand or lacks judgment to make an informed decision regarding his or her need for treatment, care or supervision.</UL><P>
6.	Current interpretations of laws that require proof of dangerousness often produce unsatisfactory outcomes because individuals are allowed to deteriorate needlessly before involuntary commitment and/or court-ordered treatment can be instituted.  When the "dangerousness standard" is used, it must be interpreted more broadly than "imminently" and/or "provably" dangerous.   <P> 
7.	State laws should also allow for consideration of past history in making determinations about involuntary commitment and/or court-ordered treatment, since past history is often a reliable way to anticipate the future course of illness.<P>
8.	An independent administrative and/or judicial review must be guaranteed in all involuntary commitment and/or court-ordered treatment determinations.  Individuals must be afforded access to appropriate representation knowledgeable about brain disorders and provided opportunities to submit evidence in opposition to involuntary commitment and/or court-ordered treatment.<P>
9.	Responsibility for determining court-ordered treatment should always be vested with medical professionals, who, in conjunction with the individual, family, and other interested parties, must develop a plan for treatment.    <P>
10.	The legal standard for states to meet in order to justify emergency commitments for initial 24 to 72 hours should be "information and belief."  For involuntary commitments beyond the initial period, the standard should be "clear and convincing evidence."  Involuntary commitments and/or court-ordered treatment must be periodically subject to administrative or judicial review to ascertain whether circumstances justify the continuation of these orders.<P>
11.	Court-ordered outpatient treatment should be considered as a less restrictive, more beneficial, and less costly treatment alternative to involuntary inpatient treatment.<P>
12.	Efforts must be undertaken to better educate justice systems and law enforcement professionals about the relationship between severe brain disorders and the application of involuntary inpatient and outpatient commitment and court-ordered treatment.<P>
13.	Private and public health insurance plans must cover the costs of involuntary inpatient and outpatient commitment and/or court-ordered treatment.    <P>

<H2>NAMI Submits Brief In Insurance Case</H2>
by Ron Honberg, Director, NAMI Legal Affairs
<hr>




	The fight to end pervasive discrimination against brain disorders in health insurance policies is being fought in the courts as well as in state legislatures and in Congress.  Recently, NAMI filed an amicus ("friend of the court") brief in a case considering this very issue.
<P>
	In Klebe v. Mitre Health Care Plan, a self-insured group health plan contained a lower lifetime maximum for "mental health benefits" than for "medical" benefits.  After exhausting all administrative appeals, the policy-holders filed suit in federal court arguing that their son's schizophrenia should be covered under the lifetime maximum for "medical treatment," not that for "mental health treatment."  After the federal district court granted summary judgement in favor of the health plan, the policyholders appealed to the Federal Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, where oral arguments are currently pending.  NAMI's brief was submitted to the Fourth Circuit in support of the policy holders.
<P>
	In granting summary judgement in favor of the health plan, the district court refused to accept evidence offered by the policyholders that schizophrenia is a biological disorder of the brain and is therefore a medical disorder.  Instead, the court determined that benefits under the plan should be classified based on the nature of treatment rendered, not by the nature of the particular illness itself.  In the court's view, the particular treatments received by the son of the policyholders (psychotropic medication, psychotherapy, etc.) fell into the category of "mental health treatment" not "medical treatment."
<P>
	In its brief, NAMI argued that the district court's application of a "treatment determinative" method of classifying mental health vs. medical benefits was incorrect based both on construction of the particular insurance policy and on court cases in other jurisdictions that have considered this issue.  There have been several cases around the country in which courts have recognized that distinctions between "mental health" and "medical" benefits should be based on the nature and etiology of particular disorders, not on specific treatments received for those disorders. 
<P>
 	For example, in Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield v. Doe, 733 S.W.2d 429 (Ark. App. 1987), an Arkansas court of appeals held that bipolar affective disorder is a physical condition and should therefore be covered (in the particular insurance policy in question) as a medical, not a mental health disorder.  Similar decisions have been reached in cases involving autism, Kunin v. Benefit Trust Life Insurance Co., 910 F. 2d 534 (9th Cir. 1990), and organic brain syndrome, Phillips v. Lincoln National Life Insurance Co., 978 F.2d 302 (7th Cir. 1992) and Malerbi v. Central Reserve Life of North America Insurance Co., 225 Neb. 543 (1987).  
<P>
	Having cited these cases, NAMI's brief asserted that the district court was mistaken in its failure to consider evidence submitted by several scientific experts who presented affidavits in this case.  Both of these experts, reflecting virtual consensus within science, concluded that schizophrenia is a physical disorder.  This clearly establishes, NAMI argued, that "as a brain disorder, schizophrenia has far more in common with conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, stroke, Tourette's syndrome and Parkinson's disease than it does with mental health problems and conditions related to life stressors or environmental factors....As a disorder affecting the brain, schizophrenia is a medical disorder, just as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes are medical disorders.
<P>
	This case, like the others cited above, unfortunately reflects the limitations of arguing that health insurance policies should cover disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar illness, and major depression as "medical disorders" based on the language of the insurance policies themselves.  Even when these arguments succeed, insurance companies simply change the language of their policies to list specific diagnostic categories that will be covered at lower levels.  Consequently, these cases have not heralded the end of discrimination against brain disorders in health insurance policies, even in the states in which the decisions have occurred. 
<P>
 	To date, there have been no major cases that have held that lower levels of coverage of brain disorders in health insurance policies constitutes discrimination.  And the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunities Commission (EEOC) has issued interim guidelines that stipulate that Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) does not apply to lower levels of coverage of "mental nervous disorders" in health insurance policies.  Consequently, although these guidelines are not binding on courts, it will be difficult to succeed with an argument that Title I of the ADA prohibits discrimination of this nature.  
   <P>
	Despite their limited precedential value, court cases such as the one discussed here, coupled with ongoing efforts by AMI advocates to achieve passage of insurance parity bills in states, can be valuable tools for educating policy makers, judges, and the public about the historical inequities in coverage of biological brain disorders.  Moreover, a few highly publicized court cases can serve to spur legislative bodies to enact legislation concerning practices identified as inequitable and unfair.  Consequently, a comprehensive assault on ending the historical discrimination against brain disorders in health insurance should involve both legislative efforts and, where necessary, legal challenges.
<P>
	A copy of the brief submitted by NAMI in this case can be obtained by contacting Sue Medford at 703/524-7600.
<P>
In granting summary judgement in favor of the health plan, the district court refused to accept evidence offered by the policyholders that schizophrenia is a biological disorder of the brain and is therefore a medical disorder.

<A NAME="freev">Free Video On Schizophrenia</A>
<P>
 Because negative symptoms of schizophrenia are frequently not recognized by professionals and are difficult for families to understand, a 60-minute tape, "Negative Symptoms in Schizophrenia" by Nancy C. Andreasen, M.D., is now available to NAMI families free of charge.  The tape defines negative symptoms and discusses treatment strategies. 
<P>
For a free tape, send your name and address to Melissa Mandrell, MHCRC - 2911 JPP, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, 200 Hawkins Drive, Iowa City, IA 52242-1057.
<P>
<A NAME="wyeth">Wyeth Offers Assistance For Effexor</A>
<P>
Effexor is a new drug for depression offered by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, which offers a program designed to provide the medication at little or no cost to uninsured outpatients when medically indicated and when patients meet certain financial criteria. 
<P>
For information, have your physician call 1-800/568-9938.

<H2>Suicides Up Among Elderly</H2>
<hr>


	The current rate for suicides among those aged 65 or older is 21.8 percent per 100,000 people, according to a January 11 report 
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  That is the highest rate of any age group, and it follows four decades of decline.  
The rate reflects a 9-percent climb between 1980 and 1992, and it is attributed--in part--to persons living longer with chronic diseases.

<H2>GAINS: For People With Co-Occurring Disorders In The Justice System</H2>
<hr>


	The National GAINS Center for People with Co-occurring Disorders in the Justice System was established in September 1995 and is a national locus for the collection and dissemination of information about effective mental health and substance abuse services for people with co-occurring disorders who come into contact with criminal justice systems.  The Center is jointly funded by the Center for Mental Health Services, the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, and the National Institute of Corrections.
<P>
	GAINS Center staff and consultants will collect information designed to influence the range and scope of mental health and substance abuse services provided in jails, prisons, and community corrections; tailor these materials to the specific needs of localities; and help localities plan, implement, and operate appropriate, cost-effective programs.
<P>
	Additionally, GAINS Center staff will collaborate with national experts, policy-makers, practitioners, researchers, consumers, and family members from the mental health, substance abuse, and criminal justice fields.  They will use the information they assemble to create innovative programs, provide technical assistance, convene interagency groups, develop a bibliographic database, and generate policy statements on key issues affecting the treatment and management of people with co-occurring disorders in the justice system.
<P>
	Inadequate, fragmented community services increase the likelihood that people with co-occurring disorders will be arrested and unnecessarily confined.  A lack of knowledge about mental illness and substance abuse disorders on the part of police, courts, and corrections staff means that people with co-occurring disorders may receive few, in any, services within the justice system, or they may be forced to accept treatment that is inappropriate for their needs.  And without appropriate treatment, the individual's symptoms may worsen.  To address these issues, the GAINS Center will help localities design, implement, and operate integrated systems of services for the treatment and management of individuals in the justice system.
<P>
	Note:  For more information about the GAINS Center, call 1-800-311-GAIN.

<H2>RI Investigation Yields Sanctions Against Managed Care Company</H2>
<hr>

by Ron Honberg, NAMI Legal Affairs
<P>
	The investigation of a private, for-profit company responsible for managing mental health services to subscribers of a large health insurance plan in Rhode Island has resulted in the imposition of severe sanctions against that company.  These sanctions are apparently the most drastic penalties ever imposed by a state against a managed behavioral health care company.
<P>        	The investigation was conducted by the Rhode Island Department of Health after numerous complaints were filed by consumers, family members, and advocates about the practices of United Behavioral Systems (UBS), a subsidiary corporation of United Health Plans of New England.  These complaints specifically articulated concerns about arbitrary restrictions imposed on inpatient and outpatient care and treatment for severe brain disorders such as schizophrenia, manic-depressive illness, and major depression as well as other mental health and substance abuse disorders.  Upon completion of its investigation, the Department of Health issued a lengthy report detailing improper practices and recommending revocation of UBS' right to operate in the state.  
<P>	According to the Providence Journal, the report cited numerous deficiencies and improper practices by UBS, including denial of medically necessary treatment based on inadequate information, bonus payments to UBS' medical and executive directors for denying care, decisions to deny care by non-physicians, withholding of information about appeals procedures from patients whose requests for care were denied, and inconsistent application of "medical necessity" criteria.  Many of these practices were direct violations of state law.  Consumers, family members, and advocates praised the report, stating that it highlighted UBS' practice of erecting bureaucratic roadblocks for vulnerable individuals with critical treatment needs and thereby discouraging all but the most assertive individuals from pursuing their rights under their health insurance policies.  
<P>	The health department's investigation was conducted under the authority of a state law regulating utilization review practices in Rhode Island.  That law requires the certification of all companies and agents conducting utilization review in Rhode Island and sets forth certain requirements for certification.  The law also authorizes the health department to impose sanctions, including monetary penalties and revocation of certification, for failure to comply with the standards in the statute and implementing regulations.  
<P>	In July 1995, UBS entered into a consent agreement with the Department of Health.  Under the terms of this agreement, UBS may continue to provide services in Rhode Island on a one-year, probationary basis.  In return, UBS agreed to pay $100,000 in fines to the health department, $50,000 of which has gone into a study to ascertain "best practices" for providing managed mental health and substance abuse services.  Additionally, UBS agreed to terminate the contracts of their medical and executive directors.  
<P>	According to Bill Emmet, executive director of the AMI of Rhode Island, the investigation and resulting sanctions have facilitated more cooperative, patient-oriented attitudes on the part of UBS.  However, Emmet is quick to note that the rest of the managed care industry in the state has not necessarily gotten the message.  "UBS seems to understand that it needs to be accountable to the consumers it serves.  However, this is not necessarily true for the entire managed care industry in Rhode Island."    	
<P>	Following issuance of its report, the health department held public hearings on managed mental health and substance abuse care in Rhode Island with the intent to ascertain how best to regulate this industry.  Most of the speakers at this hearing were consumers, family members, and treatment providers.  According to the Providence Journal, treatment providers have "shied away" from criticizing insurance companies.  However, the health department's report and recommended penalties encouraged many of these providers to come forward and articulate their concerns about managed care practices.
<P>	Interestingly, a number of speakers at the hearing expressed their belief that a 1994 law that requires coverage of severe brain disorders in health insurance policies equal to that of other physical disorders prohibits utilization review practices by managed care providers that single out people with severe brain disorders for discriminatory or inequitable treatment.  According to Bill Emmet, this highlights the value of insurance parity laws as anti-discrimination measures.  "It is now evident to most people in this state that the managed care companies have indeed treated people with mental illnesses unfairly, and as they look for ways to rectify that situation, many are citing the parity law."  (See article on New Hampshire and Rhode Island parity bills in the July/August 1994 Advocate.)      
<P>	The sanctions imposed on UBS in Rhode Island illustrate the importance of laws that regulate the way managed care companies conduct their activities.  According to the Intergovernmental Health Policy Project, a number of states have enacted laws regulating certain aspects of managed care practices during the past few years.  For example, in 1995 at least three states--Maryland, Arizona, and Indiana--enacted laws regulating utilization review practices.  These were added to similar laws passed in four states--Kansas, Vermont, Maine, and California--in 1994.  The 1994 Vermont law was enacted specifically to address mental health services in managed care plans.      
<P>	Additionally, legislation addressing protections for patients in managed care plans was considered in twenty states in 1995 and enacted in two of these states, New Hampshire and Maryland.  These laws, modeled after legislation developed by the American Medical Association, address issues such as certification requirements for managed care plans, managed care standards, notification and appeals procedures, and other aspects of patient rights.  A patient protection act was also passed in 1995 by the Texas legislature, but was subsequently vetoed by Governor George Bush, Jr.

<h4><font color="#000080">Anti-stigma Poster Makes A Difference</font></h4>
<p>
by Stephanie Naso, NAMI intern
<P>
	The stigma surrounding people with brain disorders is painful 
and frustrating and all too evident in our daily lives.  NAMI and 
other advocacy organizations constantly struggle to end the shame 
felt by those of us who have brain disorders.  One of NAMI's most 
popular stigma-busting tools is our "People with Mental Illness 
Enrich Our Lives" poster, which features names of famous artists 
and academia who have had brain disorders and have also made an 
impression on all of our lives.  
	<P>
Mitch Vesaas is the director of Tellurian/UCAN, an agency in Dane 
County, Wisconsin, that serves people who have brain disorders and 
problems with substance abuse and are oftentimes homeless.  He said 
that last year Tellurian bought several of NAMI's "People with 
Mental Illness Enrich Our Lives" posters and hung them throughout 
their group homes and shelters with the hope that residents would 
appreciate the message that they are not alone in their struggle 
and their brain disorder does not diminish their self-worth.  
<P>
	Within days, the names on the posters began to grow.  The 
residents had signed their own names to the list of famous people 
with brain disorders who have contributed to our society.  They, 
<P>
too, have something valuable to offer and wanted it to be 
recognized.  Tellurian not only framed the posters with the 
additional names, but arranged to have a billboard with a new, 
added-names poster and local AMI information erected in Madison, 
Wisconsin, during Mental Illness Awareness Week.
	<P>
NAMI was thrilled to learn about this positive action in our 
struggle against discrimination.  Stories like this one encourage 
us all to keep fighting for the rights of people with brain 
disorders.
  <P>
   Note:  To inquire about a copy of the original poster, call NAMI 
at 703/524-7600 and ask for the Resource and Distribution 
Department.  Posters are $3, plus shipping and tax, where 
applicable.

<H2>Campaign to End Discrimination Launched</H2>
<hr>


NAMI successfully launched its major, multi-year Campaign to End 
Discrimination against People with Severe Mental Illness at a 
February 1 press conference held at the National Press Club in 
Washington, D.C.
<P>
"This initiative is an historic attempt to end the stigma that has 
plagued our families and loved ones for centuries," said NAMI 
President Rona Purdy.  "We are letting the world know that it is 
not acceptable to discriminate against us anymore!"  NAMI Board 
Member Fred Frese of Ohio addressed the media with his family to 
tell the world what it is like to experience neurological brain 
disorders.  Dr. Rex Cowdry, acting director of the National 
Institute of Mental Health, provided the medical and scientific 
data supporting mental illnesses as treatable brain disorders.
<P>
	NAMI's campaign will work with the grassroots membership to 
tell the public that mental illnesses are brain disorders.  Year-
one efforts will confront discrimination against people with these 
illnesses--illnesses just like cancer, diabetes, and heart disease-
-in health care, reimbursement programs, employment practices, 
education, and housing.
<P>
	"I am delighted at the success of the press conference in 
terms of both the tremendous interest we generated and in the 
apparent societal readiness to receive our very important message--
which we will continue to send throughout our entire campaign," 
said NAMI Executive Director Laurie Flynn.

<H2>New Law Denies SSI, SSDI To Those With Alcoholism And Drug Addictions</H2>
<H4>by Dee Mukherjee, NAMI legal liaison</H4>
<hr>

	New legislation (P.L.104-121) stipulates that people disabled due to drug addiction or alcoholism (DAA) will be ineligible for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) disability benefits and, therefore, Medicare and Medicaid coverage linked to SSDI and SSI. This legislation affects both those currently receiving benefits and those applying for them.  
<P>
	The new law applies to people whose "drug addiction or alcoholism is a contributing factor material to their disability."  Those who qualify for SSDI or SSI benefits based on another disability will retain their eligibility.  
<P>
	This legislation applies immediately to any new or pending benefits claims, and individuals currently receiving disability benefits based on DAA will have their benefits terminated on January 1, 1997. Those now receiving benefits that will terminate because of the new DAA provisions will be notified; however, they may reapply to determine whether they have another disabling impairment that would make them eligible to receive SSDI or SSI benefits.  Individuals will also be able to appeal ineligibility determinations or termination of benefits.  
<P>
	The new law also requires those who are receiving SSDI or SSI benefits due to another disabling impairment and who also have a DAA condition and cannot manage their own benefits to have a representative payee.  Presumably, individuals who do not identify a representative payee will be assigned one.  A representative payee may be a nonprofit social service agency, a governmental social service agency or public guardian, a family member, or other interested person.  Additionally, all SSI and SSDI beneficiaries with DAA conditions will be referred to a state drug and alcoholism agency for treatment.  
<P>
	P.L.104-121 was driven by both cost containment and policy concerns.  From a policy perspective, it is the stated belief of Congress that providing SSDI and SSI benefits to alcoholics and/or drug addicts "fails to serve the interests of addicts and alcoholics, many of whom use their disability checks to purchase drugs and alcohol."  This may be true; however, NAMI is concerned that the new law could easily be misapplied to individuals dually diagnosed with severe mental illnesses and substance abuse disorders.  The prevalence of co-occurring substance abuse disorders among people with severe mental illnesses is quite high. 
<P>
 In fact, it is estimated that substance abuse disorders among young people with severe mental illnesses may exceed 50 percent, and the rates may be even higher among people who are homeless and severely mentally ill or who are not linked up with treatment.  
<P>
	Consumers with dual diagnoses who are currently SSDI or SSI recipients or applicants for these benefits should obtain documentation from their psychiatrist or physician that states that they are disabled due to severe mental illness.  This letter should clearly confirm that mental illness is the contributing factor to disability and that, without SSI or SSDI benefits, essential psychiatric care may not be available.
<P>
	Note:  For more information about the P.L.104-121, contact the Social Security's 24-hour, toll-free number, 1-800-772-1213.  Service representatives are available between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. on business days.

<H2>Drugs and the Brain </H2>
<H4>by Solomon Snyder
</H4></font>
<hr>



	Dr. Snyder has published a revised edition of his original 
1986 work, Drugs and the Brain.  In his book he describes what 
scientists have discovered so far about the mechanisms by which 
drugs affect the brain.  The text covers not only the brain 
disorders commonly refereed to as mental illnesses, but also other 
brain disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.  
Well-done diagrams and illustrations supplement the text, which can 
sometimes be challenging to those without a scientific bent.  Dr. 
Snyder, who has been a leader in the field of brain research and in 
the use of drugs in psychiatry for a quarter of a century, is 
director of the Department of Neuroscience at Johns Hopkins 
University.

<H2>NAMI Analysis of President Clinton's FY 1998 Budget Proposal</H2>
<H4>February 7, 1997</H4>
</font>
<hr>

On February 6, President Clinton introduced his $1.7 trillion budget proposal for FY 
1998.  As is being widely reported in the press, the plan is designed to eliminate the 
federal budget deficit by 2002, offer targeted tax cuts and a reduction of $100 billion from 
the future growth of Medicare.  The President's budget contains a range of policy 
proposals of importance to people with serious brain disorders.  It also includes a range of 
proposed budget cuts and increases in critical programs of concern to NAMI.  Included 
below is a program-by-program analysis of the budget plan.  
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">
NIMH </font><hr>
<P>
For FY 1998, The Administration is proposing an overall NIH budget of $13.1 billion, an 
increase of $337 million (2.6 percent) over this year.  $271 million of this increase is 
directed toward research project grants ($1.5 billion of which is earmarked for AIDS 
research), with $90 million directed toward the second phase of construction of the new 
Clinical Research Center.  The Administration is proposing $630 million for NIMH, a $26 
million increase over FY 1997 (a 4% increase).  This about average for the increases 
proposed for NIH's 13 institutes.  The Administration is requesting a 9% increase for 
NIDA, but only 3% increases for the Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Heart, 
Lung and Blood and Cancer Institutes.  However, these proposed increases are far below 
the increases that key congressional leaders such as Rep. John Edward Porter (R-IL) and 
Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA) have pledged to push for.  Senator Specter intends to 
increase NIH by 7.5% in FY 1998 and Senator Connie Mack (R-FL) has introduced a 
resolution to double NIH's budget over the next 5 years.  The Administration's budget 
does not contain any substantive proposals relating to NIH's mission or its pending 
authorization bill.
   <P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">
Medicaid </font><hr>
<P>
The President's budget contains a proposal to trim future Medicaid spending by $22 
billion through imposition of a "per capita cap" on federal spending and reform of the 
Disproportionate Share (DSH) program.  These savings are partially offset by changes to 
the current welfare reform initiative (including protecting eligibility for children and legal 
immigrants) which cost $13 billion.  This results in a net savings of $9 billion between 
1998 and 2002.  Overall, the federal share of Medicaid is projected to be $104 billion in 
FY 1998.  This follows the current trend of slowing in program growth over the past few 
years - down to a 3.5% growth rate in 1996, from double digit growth in the late 80's and 
early 90's.  This recent slow down in growth rates has largely accomplished the cuts that 
Congress and the President considered as part of deficit reduction plans considered in 
1995 and 1996.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Per Capita Cap Proposal </font>- The per capita cap plan would place strict state-by-state 
limits on federal Medicaid spending.  Each state's per capita cap would be set on the basis 
of a complicated assessment of current Medicaid spending.  States would be responsible 
for any spending beyond the federally capped contribution.  As such, the proposal's main 
purpose is simply to set an outer limit on federal spending.  In order to help states cope 
with impact of fewer federal dollars going into their Medicaid programs, the budget 
proposes several important programmatic changes.  
<P>
Under the Administration's proposal, states would no longer have to seek federal 
approval, through the Section 1115 waiver process, in order to require beneficiaries to 
enroll in managed care plans.  Repeal of the Section 1115 waiver process would eliminate 
what little federal oversight that has been exercised over the Medicaid managed care 
"behavioral health carve outs" that people with serious brain disorders are joining in 
increasing numbers.  This process would accelerate in increasing numbers if states were 
allowed to compel participation as the Administration is requesting.  President Clinton is 
also seeking repeal of the Boren Amendment - the provision in current law that requires 
Medicaid to pay providers at comparable rates to the private market.  
<P>
The prospects for the per capita cap plan in Congress are dim.  On a bipartisan basis, the 
nation's governors have expressed strong opposition to the proposal.  Senate Majority 
Leader Trent Lott (R-MS) has also made clear his misgivings.  In addition, regional 
disparities in health care spending are likely to crease huge difficulties for Congress in 
trying to determine the basis for each state's cap level, thereby making interstate disputes 
over funding nearly impossible to resolve.   
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Medicaid Expansions </font>- As noted above, the per capita cap and DSH reforms would save 
the federal government $22 billion over 6 years.  This is offset by $13 billion in increased 
Medicaid spending in several important areas.  First, the Administration is proposing to 
protect Medicaid eligibility for legal immigrants and children who are set to lose eligibility 
for SSI benefits under the welfare reform law signed into law last summer (P.L. 104-193).  
The cost for protecting SSI Children losing cash benefits is projected to be $300 million 
over 6 years.  A relatively small total since 85,000 of the 135,000 children likely to be cut 
off would retain Medicaid eligibility on the basis of their family's low-income status.  A 
more detailed analysis of the just released Childrens' SSI changes is available on the 
NAMI Net.  Continuing eligibility for legal aliens is more costly since the welfare law gave 
states tremendous leeway on whether to grant eligibility for persons entering the U.S. after 
enactment of the welfare bill.  
<P>
Of critical importance to NAMI is a proposal to allow states to establish an income related 
premium "buy-in" for people with disabilities who leave the SSI rolls for employment.  It 
would allow SSI beneficiaries who earn more than certain (yet to be specified) amounts to 
purchase Medicaid coverage by paying a premium that states would set on an income 
related scale.  This proposal is part of a Social Security "return to work" plan which is 
referenced below.  The other major Medicaid expansion relates to the President's 
Childrens' Health Care initiative detailed below.     
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">
Childrens' Health </font><hr>
<P>
Both the Administration and Congress are interested in expanding access to health 
coverage for low-income children of working families.  It is estimated that 80% of the 10 
million uninsured children have at least 1 parent in the workforce.  These workers either 
do not have employer provided coverage or are offered "individual only" policies in the 
workplace.  There are 3 parts to the Administration's "Kiddie Care" plan:  a) children of 
workers between jobs (coverage financed by annual state grants to cover premium costs 
for up to 6 months), b) children whose parents earn too much for Medicaid, but too little 
to afford private health insurance (coverage financed through discretionary grants to the 
states for innovative programs), and c) children eligible for Medicaid, but not currently 
enrolled (1-year of extended coverage for children only in cases where parents are at risk 
of losing coverage because of higher earnings or other change in circumstances).  This 
latter category also includes the so-called "Waxman Kids", i.e. children ages 13-18 who 
were to be phased in over the next 5 years.
<P>
Neither the Clinton proposal for expanding coverage for uninsured children, or the current 
congressional alternatives, specify the scope of benefits that private health plans would be 
required to make available to eligible children.  Thus, there is currently no requirement in 
the proposal for mental illness parity for children with brain disorders.  
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">
HUD </font><hr>
<P>
The Clinton Administration is proposing $24.753 billion for the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development for FY 1998.  This is a $5.5 billion increase over current year 
levels, with most of the increase going to renewal of expiring Section 8 rental contracts, 
expansion of tenant-based rental assistance for welfare recipients who are required to 
work and replacement of the most troubled public housing projects.  It is highly unlikely 
that Congress would support efforts to increase HUD's budget in FY 1998.  In fact, HUD 
programs are likely to be squeezed further this year as Congress struggles to find the funds 
necessary to deal with Section 8 renewals and expiring 30-year rental contracts and 
federally insured mortgages, all while avoiding cuts to politically popular programs such as 
CDBG and HOME.    
<P>
For housing programs serving people with brain disorders, the Administration is proposing 
substantial cuts.  The Section 811 program is slated for a $20 million cut, down from its 
current total of $194 million to $174 million.  This continues the current downward trend 
in funding for Section 811, which was funded at $233 million just two years ago.  
Likewise, the Section 202 program (which serves the elderly) is slated for an even larger 
cut of $345 million - a cut of more than 50%.  
<P>
The Administration is proposing no funding for tenant-based rental assistance for non-
elderly people with disabilities (including individuals with serious brain disorders).  For the 
current year, Congress appropriated $50 million for "non-elderly disabled" who are 
adversely impacted by designation of public and assisted housing as "elderly only."  This 
means that for the first time in several years, HUD is not proposing any new resources to 
deal with the emerging housing crisis facing non-elderly people with disabilities as they are 
deemed ineligible for a growing share of public and assisted housing.  The one bright spot 
in the budget proposal is a $9 million increase for fair housing enforcement (up to $39 
million).        
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">
Social Security </font><hr>
<P>
For the coming year, Social Security will be largest (and fastest growing) federal program, 
up to $414 billion in FY 1998.  This includes $25.4 billion for the SSI program (for more 
than 5 million eligible recipients) and $36 billion for SSDI benefits (for 4.5 million eligible 
recipients).  The budget also includes more than $70 million in payments to state VR 
agencies for rehabilitation services for beneficiaries (covering services for only 6,000 
people).  The President's budget includes a "Ticket To Independence" proposal designed 
to promote work among beneficiaries and help move people off the disability rolls.  
Currently, less than 1% of beneficiaries leave the rolls.  This despite the fact that many 
beneficiaries, including people with serious brain disorders, want to work.  
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">"Ticket To Independence" Plan </font>- Specifically, the "Ticket To Independence" proposal 
includes a pilot in 5 to 10 states.  It would allow people with disabilities to use their 
"ticket" with any participating public or private employment or rehabilitation provider of 
their choice (thus eroding the current state VR monopoly).  Providers would be paid only 
when clients are placed in jobs and are removed from the disability rolls.  A new 
demonstration program would allow eligible SSDI beneficiaries to extend Medicare 
coverage beyond the current trial work period once earnings surpass substantial gainful 
activity (SGA).  States would be allowed to extend Medicaid coverage for SSI 
beneficiaries beyond current limits that wipe out eligibility once SGA is achieved.
<P>
While the Clinton Administration's proposal has not been fully fleshed out, there are 
several important qualifications.  SSA cannot move forward without congressional 
authorization.  Also, for SSI beneficiaries, there is nothing that would allow the federal 
government to compel states to extend Medicaid coverage for beneficiaries whose 
earnings are above SGA. 
<P>
From NAMI's perspective, the proposal appears to fall short of the recommendations in 
the recently released report on the state VR system.  First, it does not include protections 
that would allow people with brain disorders to maintain an "open file" that would protect 
eligibility after achieving SGA and losing cash benefits (such an approach would respond 
to the episodic nature of severe mental illness by allowing people to have cash benefits 
quickly restored).  Second, by paying providers only for clients who reach the current 
definition of SGA, the Administration's plan discourages providers from serving people 
with the most severe illnesses and conditions.  Finally, nothing in the proposal requires 
providers to offer long-term supports and services for clients after they have been 
successfully placed in jobs.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">SSI Benefits for Legal Immigrants</font> - The Clinton budget proposes to restore SSI 
eligibility for legal immigrants and refugees who were to be cut off later this year under 
the welfare reform law (P.L. 104-193).  Provisions in the welfare law were designed to 
deny SSI benefits to 500,000 legal aliens, producing a savings of $2.2 billion in FY 1998.  
It is interesting to note that unlike recent changes to the SSI program aimed at persons 
with substance abuse disorders and children, the legal immigrant changes apply regardless 
of the severity of the individual's illness or impairment.  
<P>
Specifically, the proposal would a) protect all immigrants who become disabled after entry 
into the U.S. and b) repeal a requirement in the law for "deeming" of sponsors' income in 
determining SSI eligibility and c) remove the mandate for sponsors to reimburse the 
government for SSI benefits that immigrants receive.  However, these new exceptions 
would not apply if an immigrant was "disabled" prior to entering the U.S.  The 
Administration's proposal also extends for two years SSI eligibility for certain refugees 
and asylees who are currently in the citizenship application pipeline.  These changes are 
estimated to cost $9.9 billion over the next 6 years.  Because of this high cost and 
resistance on the part of GOP leaders to opening up in the welfare reform law to changes, 
passage of the proposal is considered remote.  Thus, legal immigrants with brain disorders 
and their families should continue moving forward with their naturalization and citizenship 
applications.  The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) is now moving to 
expedite applications.  The INS also recently put in place new regulations designed to 
provide exceptions to the naturalization exam and oath requirements for persons with 
severe mental illness.     
<P>

<font color="#FF0000" size="3">SAMHSA</font> - For FY 1998, the Administration is proposing $2.2 billion for the 
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).  This is a $35 
million increase over what Congress appropriated for the current fiscal year.  All of this 
increase is directed toward the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) -- $10 
million for the Substance Abuse Block Grant and $28 million for data collection 
(substance abuse prevention is slated for a $5 million cut).  The Administration is 
proposing to freeze all programs under the Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS):  
$275.4 million for the Mental Health Block Grant, $58 million for consolidated mental 
health demonstration grants (known as "Knowledge Development and Application" or 
KDAs), $70 million for the Childrens' Mental Health program, $20 million for PATH and 
$22 for PAIMI.

 Confronting America's Mental Illness Crisis.  By E. Fuller Torrey.  244 pp. New York: John Wiley & Sons.  $27.95
<hr>
 In New York City, the bag lady roams the streets scavenging in trash cans while she talks with the President of the United States.
One day she is found raped and stabbed to death.  In a hospital emergency room, a man with symptoms of acute manic depression rejects
the advice of the resident and the urgings of his family and walks out.  Several hours later, he hangs himself.  A woman with a history of 
schizophrenia walks into a shopping mall and shoots at everyone in sight, killing three.  What these tales have in common is that severely mentally
ill people declined treatment and that no one could force them to be hospitalized or take medication.
<P>
 In "Out of the Shadows," E. Fuller Torrey compiles these cases and many more like them into a powerful indictment of how we treat people suffering from 
acute mental disease.  A psychiatrist specializing in schizophrenia, he draws on years of experience working in a public psychiatric hospital in Washington and at a 
clinic for the homeless who are mentally ill.  His new book is written with a passionate combativeness that borders on polemic, but the
crisis he delineates should stir any halfway sensitive human being to anger.
<P>
 Today, in the United States, some five and a half million people over the age of 9 are estimated to suffer from severe mental illness,
almost half of them enduring without treatment.  The proportion, once large, of such people kept in state psychiatric hospitals has
fallen drastically, the result of a 40-year movement known as "deinstitutionalization."  Nowadays, many mentally ill Americans are in nursing homes
that can provide custodial attention but little else.  Roughly 159,000 of the untreated acutely ill are in prison, mostly for minor crimes
like shoplifting; another 150,000 of them are homeless, and they make up about one-third of those outcasts of our affluence.
<P>
 Dr. Torrey attributes the horrific situation to three causes.  First, income security and disability programs like Medicaid fostered
deinstitutionalization -- far more of it, he argues, than did the advent of antipsychotic drugs like Thorazine -- because they 
encouraged state authorities to shift patients into programs like nursing home care that the Federal Government pays for.  
Second, civil liberties lawyers fought successfully against involuntary commitment.  For exceptions to be made in cases where
people are a danger to themselves or society, Dr. Torrey notes, you either have to try to kill the judge or attempt suicide before
the bench.  Third, American culture has come to define severe mental illness as just one point on a broad spectrum of
"mental health" problems that run from mild neurosis to manic depression, the product of environmental stresses of a Freudian 
or socioeconomic nature.
<P>
 Dr. Torrey insists that severe  mental illnesses are measurable neurobiological disorders and in most cases are treatable
with drugs.  He quotes the psychiatrist Darold Treffert in arguing against civil libertarian dogmatism: "The liberty to be
naked in a padded cell in a county jail, hallucinating and tormented, without treatment that ought to be given is not liberty; 
it is another form of imprisonment -- imprisonment for the crime of being ill."  Dr. Torrey urges that the criteria for involuntary
commitment should include the need for treatment.  And he advocates consolidating responsibilities for the mentally ill
at the state level, to reduce the practice of shifting costs.
<P>
 But Dr. Torrey neglects to peer behind his premises.  Although we know more every day about the correlation of
biology and mental illness, it is not always clear what is cause and what is effect.  Then, too, commitment based on need for
treatment could invite abuse, especially if hearsay evidence is allowed, a position that Dr. Torrey seems to endorse.  And the record 
of psychiatric hospitals falls somewhat short of ideal.  Like all polemics, "Out of the Shadows" should be read  with caution, but

<font color="#FF0000" size="3"><H2>Risperidone for bipolar disorder?</H2></font>
<P>
	Risperidone (Risperdal) may be an effective treatment for 
bipolar disorder, according to a McLean Hospital study reported by 
Psychopharmacology Update (PU) (September 1996).  The study 
involved 15 persons with acute mania with psychotic features who 
did not respond well to traditional therapy.  "Of the 13 patients 
who completed two weeks of risperidone treatment, eight had a 50 
percent improvement in scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating 
Scale, with all the patients having at least a 25 percent 
improvement," reported PU, which added that "In addition to the 
improvement noted in all patients using risperidone, researchers 
emphasized that the medication was well-tolerated and that no 
patient worsened under the treatment."  (See Maurico Tohen, M.D., 
et al., Journal of Clinical Psychiatry 57(6):249-253.)

<H4>The Phonetree</H4>	
<P>
AMI of Wisconsin uses a Phonetree to reach more than 200 members of 
the Advocacy Network in less than a day.  Unlike a typical phone 
tree, AMI-WI's system doesn't rely on dozens of volunteers to be 
home to get the word out.  The Phonetree (with a capital "P") is an 
automated voice mail broadcast system.  
<P>
	This piece of electronic equipment is no larger than a 
conventional answering machine, yet it is very powerful.  It can be 
programmed to contact ten groups of people with up to 500 people in 
each group.
	<P>
When the phone is answered, the Phonetree broadcasts a pre-recorded 
message of up to three minutes.  If it is picked up by an answering 
machine, the recipient can play it back as often as needed to get 
all the details.  If the phone is answered in person, the 
individual can press a key to have the message repeated.
<P>
	When the phone is not answered at all or is busy, the 
Phonetree makes note of that and periodically retries that number 
until it gets through.  The machine costs approximately $500 and 
pays for itself pretty quickly because it saves so much staff time, 
copying, and postage.
<P>

<h3><font color="#000080">President's Column</font></h3>
<H4>NAMI and Brain Disorders:  Open Your Mind <BR>
by Annie Saylor, NAMI President </H4> 
<P>
	Two people with dopamine-related brain disorders reside at my  
parent's home in Kentucky.  Both have lost some functioning in a  
portion of the brain--one's loss affects motor control and the  
other's loss affects control of thoughts and emotions.  Both take  
medications to relieve their symptoms.  Neither disorder is  
curable, nor are the causes of either's disorder completely known.  
 Both see specialists for their treatment, both need supports to  
make it possible for them to live at home, and both work at  
recovery and at learning to live with and surmount their disorders.  
 One has Parkinson's, and the other has been diagnosed with  
schizophrenia. 
 <P>
	Try to imagine a world in which these disorders have the same  
public acceptance and equality in insurance, treatment and recovery  
options, job training and opportunities, and housing.  Distance  
yourself just once from the "mental illness" mindset and envision a  
world in which our disorders are brain disorders, in which the  
steps are diagnosis, treatment, supports, and then getting on with  
life.  Picture not being stuck forever in the mental illness  
quagmire. 
	 <P>
Some would say this is an impossible dream, that the term brain  
disorder doesn't sound serious enough, and that we must cling to  
the word mental because somehow our disorders are different.  Our  
membership was divided 50-50 in the vote on this subject at the  
recent NAMI annual convention. 
 <P>
	Neither Parkinson's nor schizophrenia is fully characterized  
by the term brain disorder, for their impact on lives goes far  
beyond that.  Neither my sister with schizophrenia nor my mother  
with Parkinson's is completely described by the term person with a  
brain disorder.  Yet why should it be more acceptable to call  
Parkinson's a brain disorder and not schizophrenia?  To insist that  
schizophrenia is mental, psychiatric, or behavioral is equivalent  
to calling Parkinson's a motor control, a stiff-limbs, or a  
trembling disorder. 
 <P>
	Because of the discriminations we have experienced, the need  
for protected funding for mental illness has been important.  In a  
short time we have seen that eroded as managed care has taken over.  
 We will likely see more erosion as block grants are deemed the  
solution to necessary budget cuts.  Mental illness is being  
mainstreamed, whether we like it or not.  Which is more likely to  
be understood by our legislators as they make the difficult  
decisions?  Mental illness, which becomes confused with mental  
health and gets written off as too expensive?  Or brain disorders,  
which forces them to recognize the discrimination they are  
perpetuating if they do not support our efforts? 
 <P>
	I often compare my family's reaction when my sister was  
diagnosed with the reaction to my mother's diagnosis.  In my  
sister's case we felt the emotional equivalent of an atomic bomb  
and wandered like its victims through the rubble of our lives.  We  
were dismayed to learn of my mother's diagnosis, but we knew so  
much more about what to expect.  And the stigma was non-existent.   
I envision a day when the impact on a family of a mental illness  
diagnosis is no different from that of all other brain disorders;  
when the professionals treating these disorders are not viewed  
differently;  when the treatment and recovery supports for these  
disorders have parity.  One step toward this vision--Open your  
mind: mental illnesses are brain disorders.

<hr>

	The Obsessive Compulsive Foundation has published this brief 
(28 pages) but very useful guide, OCD and Parenting, for parents of 
children with OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder).  Written by 
treatment professionals, the text is user-friendly, in part because 
of its conversational question-and-answer format.  The book 
includes a bibliography and lists additional resources.  It is 
available from the OCD Foundation, P.O. Box 70, Milford, CT 06460-
0700.  The price is $4 for non-foundation members.

<P>
	<I>I Can See Tomorrow--A Guide For Living with Depression</I> by 
Patricia L. Owen, Ph.D., is a very complete book on depression with 
informative addenda that include resources and agencies throughout 
the nation to help people with depression and bipolar disorder.
	<P>
Dr. Owen has provided a helpful guide for those who recognize or 
suspect that they have depression.  From the start, readers who may 
only suspect they have depression can hold themselves up against 
the measures of the types and symptoms of depression to make that 
first judgment about obtaining appropriate treatment, whether that 
is medications, psychotherapy, or both.  The book is especially 
valuable for those who also are recovering alcoholics or substance 
abusers. 
<P>	
Dr. Owen offers an assortment of information about the defining 
features of depression, the causes of depression, therapy, 
medications, relationships with family, and the spiritual 
dimensions of this disorder.  Each of her chapters discusses a 
topic and includes questions readers may ask about themselves 
relative to the topic and what they may do to help themselves.
	<P>
Because stigma still surrounds depression as it does other 
psychiatric disorders, Dr. Owen's discussions about common 
misperceptions and myths may be particularly helpful.  This 
information can be central to readers' accepting their depression, 
the causes of depression, selecting a psychotherapist, accepting 
the need for using an antidepressant, and finding a comfortable 
position in the family, with friends, and in organizations like 
Alcoholics Anonymous.  The battle against depression is formidable, 
but the barrier of stigma significantly magnifies it.
	<P>
Owen also has complied an appendix listing some of the common 
antidepressants.  She includes information about how the 
medications work, side effects, dosages, and specific pointers for 
recovering alcoholics and substance abusers.
<P>
	Dr. Owen comments on the theoretical nature of chemical 
imbalance as a cause of brain disorders and on persons with 
depression having the right to contribute to treatment decisions 
about their own care.  The reviewers believe, however, that putting 
too much emphasis on the empowerment of the person as opposed to 
the value of the medication may lead to some depressed persons 
deciding against needed medication, temporarily or permanently, 
because of their depressed mood.  They may act out of simple 
dislike of taking medications rather than out of clear thinking 
about the therapeutic value of the prescribed drug.
<P>
	Overall, Dr. Owen provides valuable information about 
depression and offers individuals and their families or significant 
others support and hope for future recovery and relief from 
illness.

Their Parents by Harold Koplewicz</b></font></h4>

<P>
Reviewed by Harriet Bladwin, NAMI Literature Committee, and Brenda 
Souto and Dee Mukherjee, NAMI staff
<P>
	It's Nobody's Fault could not have been written 25 years ago. 
<P>
 It reflects the monumental change that has taken place in 
understanding all mental illnesses--that they are brain disorders, 
disturbances in brain chemistry, and nobody's fault.  This work 
deals with serious brain disorders in children and adolescents.  
Its author is an experienced clinician, Chief of Child and 
Adolescent Psychiatry at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center and 
Associate Professor of Psychiatry at the Albert Einstein College of 
Medicine.  Koplewicz is upbeat, authoritative, and empowering.  And 
his book is interesting and readable.
<P>
	It's Nobody's Fault has three parts.  "Living with a Child's 
Brain Disorder" sets out Dr. Koplewicz's general views: that 
parents don't cause serious mental disorders, but they are 
responsible for getting their ill children into treatment.  "DNA 
Roulette and the Role of Medication" explains the role of genetics 
in brain disorders in children and adolescents, the ways in which 
those disorders affect brain chemistry, and the role of medications 
in treatment.  "No-Fault Brain Disorders" discusses 13 specific 
disorders commonly found in children and adolescents--symptoms, 
diagnosis, brain chemistry, treatment, and parenting.  There are 
three appendices.  The first reviews technical terms used in the 
book; the second lists organizations that provide educational and 
support services; and the last consists of charts that summarize 
the medications (by brand and generic names) used in treating the 
discussed disorders as well as their possible side effects.
<P>
	Koplewicz is "must reading" for parents who feel guilt and 
remorse about the brain disorder of a child.  The author emphasizes 
that child and adolescent disorders are the result of genetic 
predispositions and that medications, often offered with 
psychotherapy, sometimes transform lives and usually make disorders 
more manageable.  This is one book every NAMI family will wish it 
had discovered when a child first showed symptoms of abnormality.  
It belongs in every affiliate library and every public library.
<P>
	Many NAMI families report that the professionals they meet 
often deny that prepubertal children can have serious brain 
disorders.  Such families face not only stigma, lack of services, 
and inappropriate education settings, but they also face great 
difficulty in finding professionals who are in touch with current 
research and treatment practice.  Furthermore, they are perplexed 
by misinformation about using medications in treating childhood-
onset brain disorders.  For such families, It's Nobody's Fault will 
bring refreshing good news.
<P>
	The only shortcoming of It's Nobody's Fault is that the 
chapters about specific disorders are necessarily brief. 
Suggestions about supplementary reading would have been a welcome 
addition.  NAMI readers are encouraged to consult the new NAMI's 
Young Family Reading List for further reading.  (For a copy, call

<P>
MTH (methamphetamine) is infrequently researched as a treatment option for childhood attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), even though it has FDA-approved labeling for the disorder.  The may be due to MTH's reputation for high abuse liability.  In a recent issue of the Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology, Dr. Paul Wender states that MTH "in clinical treatment of children is neither renegade nor experimental, and it should not be considered controversial."  For information, call the Child Psychopharmacology Information Center at 608/262-6171.

<A NAME = "newst"><H2>NEW STUDY ON BIPOLAR DISORDER</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
A new treatment-outcome and research network dedicated to the study of manic-depressive illness, the Stanley Foundation Bipolar Network, includes national and international researchers and expert clinicians working in close association with NAMI and the National Depressive and Manic-Depressive Association (NDMDA). 
<P>
These groups will work together to assess the efficacy of existing treatments for bipolar disorder and the development of new therapeutic agents.  Participating research centers will recruit and treat patients with bipolar illness using standard protocols and assessments within randomized clinical trials. 
<P>
"The mission of the bipolar network is to advance the scientific knowledge and understanding of bipolar illness, its cause or causes, and its treatments with the goals of establishing optimal treatment strategies," said Robert Post, M.D., chief of the Biological Psychiatry Branch of NIMH. 
<P>
More information about this network is available in Bipolar Network News (BNN), a newsletter about the latest bipolar-disorder findings for patients and clinicians.  For a copy of BNN, write or fax your request to Bipolar Network News, 5430 Grosvenor Lane, Suite #200,

<A NAME = "nonco"><H2>NONCOMPLIANCE AND SCHIZOPHRENIA</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
While many advances have been made in treating schizophrenia, much of the improvement has been rendered virtually meaningless in actual practice because of the persistently large percentage of patients who fail to take their medication, a researcher says.

<P>
As estimated 74 percent of outpatients with schizophrenia stop taking neuroleptics--or anti-psychotic drugs--within two years of leaving a hospital or program, Peter Weiden told the American Medical Association's (AMA) 13th Annual Science Reporters Conference in Seattle in November. 
<P>
Weiden, director of the schizophrenia program at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital and assistant clinical professor at Columbia University, said the 74 percent estimate is likely low because it does not take into account persons with schizophrenia who refuse treatment or drift from one place to another.
<P>
Non-compliance is different in people suffering from schizophrenia than in those with other chronic problems (such as diabetes) who "eventually figure out they need medicine," Weiden said.  It has been shown that persons with schizophrenia have the type of brain disorder that makes it difficult for them to learn from experience.  "One of the symptoms of their illness is they don't know they're sick," according to Weiden.
<P>
Non-compliance accounts for at least 40 percent of all episodes of schizophrenic relapse and subsequent rehospitalization, Weiden says, and the relapses suffered by persons off their medication are often more severe and difficult to treat.
<P>
Resources devoted to developing new drugs should be coupled with research on why patients stop taking their medication.  "The difference between being on treatment and off treatment magnifies as drugs get better," Weiden told his audience.  Research into the non-compliance problem is "virtually non-existent," he said.
<P>

<A NAME = "obses"><H2>OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
-- A woman visits her dermatologist, complaining of extremely dry
skin and seldom feeling clean. She showers for two hours every
day.
<P>
-- A lawyer insists on making coffee several times each day. His
colleagues do not realize that he lives in fear that the coffee
will be poisoned, and he feels compelled to pour most of it down
the drain. The lawyer is so obsessed with these thoughts that he
spends 12 hours a day at work -- four of them worrying about
contaminated coffee.
<P>
-- A man cannot bear to throw anything away. Junk mail, old
newspapers, empty milk cartons all "could contain something
valuable that might be useful some day." If he throws things
away, "something terrible will happen." He hoards so much clutter
that he can no longer walk through his house. Insisting that
nothing be thrown away, he moves to another house where he
continues to hoard.
<P>
These people suffer from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. The
National Institute of Mental Health estimates that more than 2
percent of the U.S. population, or nearly one out of every 40
people, will suffer from OCD at some point in their lives. The
disorder is two or three times more common than schizophrenia and
manic depressive illness.
<P>
What is Obsessive Compulsive Disorder?
<P>
Obsessions are intrusive, irrational thoughts--un wanted ideas or
impulses that repeatedly well up in the victim's mind. Again and
again, the person experiences disturbing thoughts, such as "My
hands must be contaminated; I must wash them"; "I may have left
the gas stove on"; or "I am going to injure my child." On one
level, the sufferer knows these obsessive thoughts are
irrational. But on another level, he/she fears these thoughts
might be true. Trying to avoid such thoughts creates great
anxiety.
<P>
Compulsions are repetitive rituals such as hand washing,
counting, checking, hoarding, or arranging. An individual repeats
these actions, perhaps feeling momentary relief but without
feeling satisfaction or a sense of completion. OCD victims feel
they must perform these compulsive rituals or something bad will
happen.
<P>
Most people at one time or another experience obsessive thoughts
or compulsive behaviors. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder occurs
when an individual experiences obsessions and compulsions for
more than an hour each day, in a way that interferes with his/her
life.
<P>
OCD is often described as "a disease of doubt." Sufferers
experience "pathological doubt," unable to distinguish between
what is possible, what is probable, and what is unlikely to
happen.
<P>
Who gets OCD?
<P>
People of all ages and from all walks of life can get OCD. It
strikes people of all ethic groups, and both males and females.
Symptoms typically begin during the teenage years or young
adulthood.
<P>
What causes OCD?
<P>
The preponderance of scientific evidence suggests that OCD
results from a chemical imbalance in the brain For years, mental
health professionals assumed OCD resulted from bad parenting or
personality defects.
<P>
This theory has been disproven over the last 20 years. OCD
symptoms have not been relieved by psychoanalysis or other forms
of "talk therapy".
<P>
OCD patients can often articulate insight into "why" they have
obsessive thoughts or why they behave compulsively. But the
thoughts and the behavior continue.
<P>
People whose brains are injured often develop OCD, suggesting
that it's a physical condition. If a placebo is given to people
who are depressed or who experience panic attacks, 40 percent
will say they feel better.
<P>
If a placebo is given to people who experience
obsessive-compulsive disorder, only about 2 percent say they feel
better. This also suggests a physical condition.
<P>
Brain scientists have identified the part of the brain that
causes OCD. They have discovered a strong link between OCD and a
brain chemical called serotonin. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter
that helps nerve cells communicate.
<P>
Scientists have also observed that people with OCD have increased
metabolism in the basal ganglia and in the frontal lobes of the
brain.
<P>
This, scientists believe, causes repetitive movements, rigid
thinking and a lack of spontaneity. People with OCD often have
high levels of the hormone Vasopressin.
<P>
In layman's terms, something in the brain is stuck, like a broken
record. Judith Rapoport, MD, describes it in her book, The Boy
Who Couldn't Stop Washing, as "grooming behaviors gone wild."
<P>
How do people with OCD typically react to their disorder?
<P>
People with OCD generally attempt to hide their problem rather
than seek help. Often they are remarkably successful in
concealing their obsessive compulsive symptoms from friends and
co-workers.
<P>
An unfortunate consequence of this secrecy is that people with
OCD generally do not receive professional help until years after
the onset of their disease. By that time, obsessive-compulsive
habits may be deeply ingrained and very difficult to change.
<P>
How long does OCD last?
<P>
For years, even decades. The symptoms may be come less severe
from time to time, and there may be long intervals when the
symptoms are mild, but generally OCD is a chronic disease.
<P>
Is age a factor in OCD?
<P>
OCD usually starts at an early age, often before adolescence.
Left untreated, it usually grows worse with age.
<P>
It may first manifest as autism, pervasive developmental
disorder, or Tourette's Syndrome (in which the patient feels
compelled to shout obscenities and insults at random). Or it can
evolve into Tourette's Syndrome, depression and anxiety.
<P>
Like depression, OCD tends to worsen with age. But scientists
hope that if OCD patients are treated at an early age, their
symptoms won't necessarily worsen as they age.
<P>
What are some more examples of people who suffer from OCD?
<P>
People who:
<P>
-- repeatedly check things, perhaps dozens of times before
feeling secure enough to go to sleep or to leave the house. Is
the stove off? Is the door locked? Is the alarm set?
<P>
-- fear they will harm others. Example:A man's car hits a pothole
on a city street and he fears it was actually a body.
<P>
-- feel dirty and contaminated. Example: A women is fearful of
touching her baby because she might contaminate it.
<P>
-- constantly arrange and order things. Example: A child can't go
to sleep unless he lines up all his shoes correctly.
<P>
-- are excessively concerned with body imperfections (who insists
on numerous plastic surgeries or spend hours a day
body-building).
<P>
-- are ruled by numbers, believing that certain numbers represent
good and other numbers represent evil.
<P>
-- are excessively concerned with sin or blasphemy.
<P>
Is OCD commonly recognized by professionals?
<P>
Not nearly enough. OCD is often misdiagnosed and underdiagnosed.
Many people have dual diagnoses of OCD and schizophrenia, or OCD
and manic-depressive illness, but the OCD component is not
diagnosed or treated.
<P>
Researchers believe OCD, anxiety disorders and eating disorders
like anorexia and bulimia can be triggered by the same chemical
mal functioning of the brain.
<P>
Is heredity a factor in OCD?
<P>
Yes. Heredity appears to be a strong factor. If you have OCD,
there's a 25 percent chance that one of your immediate family
members will have it. It definitely seems to run in families.
<P>
Can OCD be effectively treated?
<P>
Yes, with medication and behavior therapy. Medication can
regulate serotonin, reduce obsessive thoughts and compulsive
behavior. In the last few years, several medications have been
developed that relieve many of the symptoms of OCD.
<P>
Three are particularly recommended as "serotonin selectors":
<P>
Clomipramine (brand name: Anafranil): This medication has been
used in Europe for more than 20 years, and is now available in
the United States. There is little evidence that clomipramine has
adverse long term negative effects, particularly no increased
rate of birth-defects.
<P>
But it can produce side effects: dry mouth, constipation,
tiredness, fatigue, slight hand trembling, sexual dysfunction,
severe weight gain. There is also the possibility of seizures in
high dos ages.
<P>
Fluoxetine (brand name: Prozac) and Sertraline (brand name:
Zoloft) are viewed as effective in some OCD patients but with far
fewer side-effects for most patients. Fluoxetine occasionally
causes nausea, weight loss, insomnia.
<P>
Despite sensationalized re ports that fluoxetine causes violent
behavior, the drug has been examined on numerous occasions by the
US Food and Drug Administration, and is deemed safe and
effective.
<P>
Sertraline is a relatively new drug that so far has shown fewer
side effects than fluoxetine and is substantially cheaper.
<P>
How long should an individual take medication before judging its
effectiveness?
<P>
Some physicians make the mistake of prescribing it for only three
or four weeks. That really isn't long enough. Medication should
be tried consistently for 10 or 12 weeks before judging its
effectiveness.
<P>
What is "behavior therapy" and can it effectively relieve
symptoms of OCD?
<P>
Behavior therapy is not traditional psychotherapy. It is
"exposure and response prevention," and has been found to be
effective for many people with OCD.
<P>
Patients are deliberately exposed to a feared object or idea,
either directly or by imagination, and are then discouraged or
prevented from carrying out the usual compulsive response.
<P>
For example, a compulsive hand-washer may be urged to touch an
object believed to be contaminated, and then may be denied the
opportunity to wash for several hours.
<P>
When the treatment works well, the patient gradually experiences
less anxiety from the obsessive thoughts and becomes able to
refrain from the compulsive actions for extended periods of time.
<P>
Several studies suggest that medication and behavior therapy are
equally effective in alleviating symptoms of OCD. About half the
patients improve substantially with behavior therapy; the rest
improve moderately with it.
<P>
If my relative with OCD refuses to take medication and won't
participate in behavioral therapy, are there any other
treatments?
<P>
Your relative could be a candidate for brain surgery.
<P>
Neurosurgeons in recent years have developed a finely-tuned
procedure with Magnetic Resonance Imaging to identify the part of
the brain that may be involved in expressing OCD. A surgeon can
make microscopic cuts in the brain, which often lead to a
decrease in OCD.
<P>
Will OCD symptoms go away completely with medication and behavior
therapy?
<P>
Response to treatment varies from person to person. Most people
treated with effective medications find their symptoms are
reduced by about 40 percent or 50 percent. That can often be
enough to change their lives, to transform them into functioning
individuals.
<P>
Some people are fortunate enough to go into total remission when
treated with effective medication and/or behavior therapy.
Unfortunately, some people find neither medication nor behavior
therapy has positive effects.

<H2>Panic Disorder Treatment Trend</H2>
<HR>


	Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are replacing alprazolam and other antidepressants as psychiatrists' choice of 
treatment for panic disorder--in combination with cognitive behavioral therapy--according to New York State Psychiatric Institute Deputy 
Director Jack Gorman, M.D.  Paxil (SmithKline Beecham), Luvox (Solvay), and Prozac (Lilly) are in Phase III studies for treatment of panic 
disorder, as is Serzone (Bristol-Myers Squibb).

<H2>Progress In Schizophrenia Genetics: Several Studies Point To Chromosome</H2></center>

 <HR>

	Data from several studies published in the November 1995 issue of Nature Genetics pinpoint the location of a gene involved in schizophrenia.  Using three independent data sets--including more than 380 families in 10 countries--scientists provide evidence that a region of chromosome 6 carries a gene involved in schizophrenia.  This statistically significant finding builds on a large body of evidence from family, twin, and adoption studies, showing that schizophrenia has a genetic component. It signals real scientific progress and an ever-increasing understanding of the biology of this severely disabling brain disorder.  
<P>
	These findings, while strong, do not eradicate the complexities of schizophrenia genetics.  A specific gene on chromosome 6 has not been identified.  And three other studies reported in the same issue of Nature Genetics failed to detect any linkage between the region of chromosome 6 found by the other research groups and schizophrenia.  In one of the studies, which positively identified chromosome 6, four other chromosomal regions were identified as well.    
<P>
	The slow progress in the molecular genetics of schizophrenia does not reflect a lack of evidence that genes play a role in this brain disorder, but rather the complexities of schizophrenia in terms of its diagnosis, relationship to other diseases, the likely involvement of more than one gene and different genes in different families, and the undoubtable role of nongenetic factors.  
<P>
	So, complications and complexities of schizophrenia genetics still exist.  Further study will be required to reconfirm the chromosome 6 location as well as other chromosome locations involved in schizophrenia and to identity specific genes in this brain disorder.  But for all of the complexities, scientists have produced the best data to date showing a linkage between a chromosome region and schizophrenia. 
<P>
	NOTE:  The "Ask the Doctor" section of the January/February issue of the Advocate will provide more information about schizophrenia genetics and gene searches.

<A NAME = "facts"><H2>FACTS ABOUT SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
What is severe mental illness?
<P>
Severe mental illnesses are biological brain diseases that can
critically interfere with a person's ability to think, feel and
relate to other people and the environment.
<P>
The U.S. Congress Office of Technology and Assessment, in
September, reported "evidence that biological factors are
involved in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression,
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and panic disorder...other
areas of research provide evidence about correlated biological
factors and suggest testable hypotheses to causation."
<P>
What are some of the more disabling mental illnesses?  How common
are they?
<P>
Schizophrenia is a brain disease that often strikes young people
between the ages of 16 and 25.  A debilitating thought disorder,
schizophrenia causes some people to experience delusions and
auditory and visual hallucinations.
<P>
They cannot distinguish what is real from what is not.  Specific
causes are yet unknown, but are believed to be biological,
sometimes involving genetic or viral factors.
<P>
Depressive disorders -- including major depression and bipolar
disorder (manic-depressive illness) -- are very common and range
widely in severity.
<P>
In any given year, about 5 million Americans, or 2.8 percent of
the adult population, suffer from severe mental illnesses.
<P>
The number one reason for hospital admissions nationwide is
psychiatric disorder.  At any moment, almost 21 percent of all
hospital beds are filled by people with mental illness.
<P>
Severe mental illnesses are more common than diabetes, cancer or
heart disease.
<P>
How many children and adolescents have severe mental illnesses?
<P>
Children, although often misdiagnosed, suffer from the same
severe mental illnesses -- schizophrenia, depressive disorders,
OCD and panic disorder -- as adults do.
<P>
In any given year, 3.2 percent of children and adolescents
between the ages of 9 and 17 are diagnosed with a severe mental
illness.
<P>
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), is a common
behavioral disorder which affects 3-5 percent of the nation's
youth under 13.
<P>
A conservative estimate is that a total of 12 percent or 7.5
million of the country's 63 million youths under age 18 have
mental, behavioral or developmental disorders.
<P>
Only about a fifth of the 7.5 million children and adolescents
who need mental health treatment receive it.
<P>
What are the costs of severe mental illness?
<P>
In 1990, mental illnesses cost the nation an estimated $74
billion, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.
<P>
Treating severe mental illnesses cost the nation approximately
$27 billion, including long-term nursing home care.
<P>
One quarter of all Social Security Disability payments are for
individuals with severe mental illnesses.
<P>
How are persons with severe mental illnesses stigmatized?
<P>
People with mental illness are feared or stereotyped as
dangerous, aggressive and violent.  In fact, they are more likely
to be isolated, passive and withdrawn.  Often they are blamed for
their illness.
<P>
They are denied opportunities to rebuild their lives in the
community because of discrimination in housing, employment and
health insurance coverage.
<P>
Is there hope for persons suffering from severe mental illness?
<P>
Yes!  Through research, scientists have made great advances in
understanding the nature of severe mental illnesses in the last
ten years.  The development of sophisticated scanning devices
which take "pictures" of the brain bring us closer to
understanding the role of brain structure and chemistry in the
causation of mental illness.
<P>
Genetic mapping may determine other causes.  Research into new
treatments have significantly improved the lives of people who
now suffer from these devastating illnesses.
<P>
The treatment success rate for schizophrenia is 60 percent, 80
percent for bipolar disorder and 65 percent for major depression.
Comparatively, the success rate for treatments of heart disease
ranges from 41-52 percent. 
<P>
The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) is a grassroots
self-help, support and advocacy organization of families, friends
and people suffering from severe mental illnesses.
<P>
Dedicated to improving the lives of people with severe,
biological brain diseases, NAMI works on the national, state and
local level through 140,000 members and 1,000 affiliates to
provide education about severe mental illnesses and to support
increased funding for research and quality services.

<A NAME = "famil"><H2>FAMILIES OF OCD SUFFERERS SUFFER</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
A survey of 450 families with someone suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) revealed that "depression, marital distress, hardship to siblings, and disruption of family personal and social life are part of the overall devastation wrought by this illness." 
<P>
Conducted by the Obsessive Compulsive Foundation, the study asked how having a OCD relative affected family life and how families coped.  Respondents reported that, to cope, they relied on lectures, reading materials, and sympathetic friends and relatives.  Almost 60 percent of family members used individual therapy to help deal with an OCD situation. 
<P>
Eighty percent of the survey respondents said that disruption of family life was a result of the disorder.  Three-fourths of family members had difficulty with their OCD relative's self-involvement, and 70 percent were bothered by the relative's lack of motivation.  About 63 percent were concerned about inconsiderate behavior, excessive arguing, and being drawn into ritualizing behavior by OCD relatives; and 66 percent cited OCD-related financial difficulties as a problem. 
<P>
Concerns of family members included dealing with the relative's lost potential; the uncertainty about what would happen to the OCD relative when the caretakers were gone; the difficulty of enjoying life while the OCD sufferer was in pain; the envy of normal families; and anger at relatives.

<P>

<A NAME = "gene"><H2>GENE FOR MANIC DEPRESSION</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
A gene, or possibly two, that could contribute to as many as one in four cases of manic depression may be on a region of chromosome 18, according to a study of 395 members of 22 families by Wade H. Berrettini and colleagues at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. 
<P>
Manic depression or recurrent depression afflicted 167 participants in the study; in eight of the families, similar genetic variations on chromosome 18 were identified.  Although this means almost two-thirds of the families had no evidence of involvement by chromosome 18, that alone would not rule out the locations:  Most scientists seeking the genetic basis of manic-depressive illness agree that more than one genetic miscue probably can set the state for, or cause, the disorder. 
<P>
The study, reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (June 21), noted two genes worthy of suspicion out of the approximately 100 genes on chromosome 18.  One codes for a protein that plays a specific part in chemical signal reception; the other is involved in stress hormone production, a physiological function that has been shown to go into overdrive in both depression and manic depression.

<HR>

<A NAME = "cloza"><H2>CLOZAPINE</H2></A>


<P>



What is Clozapine?



<P>



Clozapine has attracted interest and curiosity from many



consumers and family members. The drug was approved for the



treatment of patients with severe and persistent schizophrenia,



who either have not adequately responded to, or cannot tolerate,



standard antipsychotic drugs.



<P>



Sandoz Pharmaceuticals manufactures and markets clozapine under



the product name Clozaril.



<P>



What is new about clozapine?



<P>



Clozapine has unique benefits and unique risks. The benefits make



it the first major innovation in anti-psychotic drugs since the



introduction of neuroleptics nearly thirty years ago. The system



designed to manage the risks associated with clozapine use make



it an innovation in treatment modalities.



<P>



How long does it take patients to respond to clozapine?



<P>



Often patients respond in as little as a week. Some may require a



much longer period, and many of those who do show the greatest



improvement. About six months is a good trial period. Once a



patient responds, he/she may continue to improve for up to a



year.



<P>



What are the benefits?



<P>



The benefits of clozapine are its superior effectiveness and its



unique side effects profile. It treats the positive symptoms of



schizophrenia such as hallucinations, delusions, blunted affect,



and hostility better than any other drug.



<P>



It is also the first drug which effectively treats the negative



symptoms -- apathy, withdrawal, blunted emotional response, and



anxiety.



<P>



It accomplishes this with 30 to 60 percent of the patients who



were previously considered refractory, that is patients who were



unresponsive to standard antipsychotic drugs.



<P>



Clozapine has virtually no incidence of the muscle spasms,



cramps, and posturing movements common to neuroleptic drugs, and



minimal incidence of the less serious neurological side effects



such as restlessness, muscle rigidity, and tremor. Nor has there



ever been a case of tardive dyskinesia associated with clozapine.



<P>



What is tardive dyskinesia?



<P>



Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a disfiguring side effect which is



characterized by involuntary movements such as grimacing, sucking



and smacking of lips, and spasmodic movements of the extremities.



<P>



For every year that a group of patients is on neuroleptic drugs,



four to five percent develop TD (20-25 percent, for example,



after five years).



<P>



In the past, tardive dyskinesia was thought to be irreversible.



The symptoms of TD patients who are put on clozapine, however,



sometimes diminish, disappear, and do not reappear if they are



withdrawn from clozapine.



<P>



How can clozapine treat both positive and negative symptoms



better than any other drug?



<P>



Clozapine poses a unique risk. Consequently, the FDA would not



approve the drug unless its effectiveness could be proven clearly



superior to that of current antipsychotic drugs.



<P>



This was done conclusively in a 16-center study involving over



300 severely ill patients. These patients had all been ill for



many years and had failed to respond to at least three potent



drugs.



<P>



What is the "unique risk"?



<P>



Approximately two percent of patients who take clozapine will



develop a condition called agranulocytosis. The white blood cell



count drops to such a low level that the patient becomes



extremely vulnerable to infections and no longer has the ability



to fight them off.



<P>



Isn't agranulocytosis associated with standard antipsychotic



drugs as well?



<P>



Yes, but the incidence with clozapine is over 10 times that of



other neuroleptics.



<P>



Is agranulocytosis fatal?



<P>



If detected early enough, the condition can be reversed by simply



withdrawing the patient from clozapine. If it goes undetected



until infections develop, the patient can die. A number of such



deaths occurred outside the U.S. before the link with



agranulocytosis was understood.



<P>



We now know that to maintain patient safety, we must check the



patient's white blood cell count each week.



<P>



Is there a way to minimize the risk of clozapine?



<P>



Yes. Patients must have weekly blood tests, and the results sent



to the patient's pharmacy before the next week's supply can be



picked up.



<P>



Are other risks associated with clozapine?



<P>



Other serious side effects include seizures, lowered blood



pressure, and increased heart rate. Seizures are also common to



all antipsychotic drugs, but in the higher dosage ranges they are



much more prevalent with clozapine.



<P>



Lowered blood pressure and increased heart rate can usually be



managed by gradually increasing a patient's clozapine dosage from



an initially minimal level.



<P>



Money Available for Clozapine



<P>



Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp., manufacturers of the medication



clozapine to treat schizophrenia, has settled an anti-trust



lawsuit over marketing the medication by agreeing to pay $21



million to increase access to the drug.



<P>



All 50 states sued the pharmaceutical corporation in 1990



because, until 1991, the drug was distributed only if patients



also purchased a blood monitoring service from a Sandoz



affiliate, Caremark Inc. The drug and the blood monitoring



together, under the Sandoz plan, cost $9,000 a year per patient.



<P>



Under the settlement agreement, Sandoz and Caremark will rebate



$38.92 a week, or $10 million to clozapine users, $3 million to



the states to pay for new patients who might benefit from the



medication, and $3 million to the National Organization for Rare



Disorders to provide clozapine scholarships for indigent



patients. Another $1 million will pay for patients in Veterans



Administration hospitals and other facilities. About $4 million



will go to legal fees.



<P>



Both parties declared victory in the settlement agreement.



<P>



<blockquote>"This is one of the highest monetary awards for an anti-trust



settlement that we've ever achieved," said Jim Spencer, special



assistant attorney general in Minnesota who led the plaintiffs.</blockquote>



<P>



<blockquote>"The lawsuit was dragging on and on, and the settlement is less



than our legal fees would have been if we had continued to pursue



the case," said Gil Honigfeld, director of scientific affairs for



Sandoz. "We have a long history of providing medication to people



who can't afford it.</blockquote>



<P>



In addition to rebates for patients and vouchers for state mental



health agencies to buy more clozapine, Spencer said the



settlement requires Sandoz to share its research database with



researchers for other pharmaceutical firms who may develop a



financial competitor to Clozaril, the Sandoz brand name



for clozapine. Sandoz has an exclusive patent on the drug until



September, 1994.



<P>



The average cost of clozapine and blood monitoring is now $100 a



week, down from $172 a week under the old arrangement, Spencer



said. The price is based on $2.85 per pill, or 400 milligrams a



day, the most common dosage. But Honigfeld said the price of



clozapine and blood monitoring have actually increased in some



areas of the country since the drug was separated from the



Caremark blood monitoring system.



<P>



Now the drug costs $4,160 per year for the typical dose,



Honigfeld said. Weekly blood monitoring, which is essential to



prevent blood clots, can cost $4,900 a year.



<P>



Spencer said clozapine use is not nearly what it should be



because Sandoz keeps the price too high. Sandoz has estimated



that more than 200,000 people could eventually benefit from the



drug.



<P>



Honigfeld said clozapine use in the United States has nearly



doubled in the last year. More than 30,000 patients now benefit



from the drug, according to Sandoz records. In Massachusetts, for



example, 28 percent of the people who could benefit from the drug



are receiving it.



<P>



In Louisiana, however, only 3 percent of the people who could



benefit from clozapine are receiving it. By the time Sandoz's



exclusive patent on the medication ends in 1994, Honigfeld



projects that 60,000 patients will be using it.



<P>



Clozapine has been especially effective in treating people with



schizophrenia who do not respond well to other medications. 



<P>



Honigfeld believes clozapine is one of several medications to



come in the next decade that will treat mental illness more



effectively, with fewer side effects.



<P>



The official settlement of the lawsuit is expected at the end of



November, and Honigfeld said checks and vouchers should be



arriving by the end of 1992.



<P>

<A NAME = "doesc"><H2>DOES CLOZEPINE ALLEVIATE FACIAL . . .</H2></A>



<P>



Does Clozepine Alleviate Facial Tics, Body Tremors?



<P>



by Allan Safferman, M.D. and Jeffrey Lieberman, M.D.



<P>



Safferman is research psychiatrist at Hillside Hospital, Long



Island Jewish Medical Center, in Glen Oaks, NY. Lieberman is



director of research in the Department of Psychiatry at Hillside



Hospital.



<P>



One of the major concerns associated with the chronic use of



neuroleptic drugs is the development of tardive dyskinesia (TD),



an abnormal, involuntary movement disorder that can affect the



facial region, the trunk, and the upper and lower extremities.



<P>



The incidence of TD varies in different populations: in non-



elderly adult psychiatric patients it occurs in 18.5 percent



after four years of neuroleptic drug treatment, and in 44 percent



after eight years of treatment.



<P>



Among the elderly, the risk of TD has been found to be over 30



percent after 43 weeks of neuroleptic drug treatment.



<P>



Abnormal movements may be caused by a variety of neurological



illnesses, and the clinician should carefully consider and



exclude other reasonable possibilities before making a diagnosis



of TD. 



<P>



The majority of TD cases are mild, and if caught in time, are



reversible.



<P>



But a small percentage of patients may actually pose a medical



risk to the patient. The movements are often cosmetically



disfiguring and may be functionally disabling.



<P>



Patients with TD may be embarrassed by these movements and their



presence may cause anxiety and alarm to patients. These patients



may be shunned by those who are ignorant about this neurological



problem, thereby hampering the patient's efforts to reintegrate



into the community.



<P>



If anti-psychotic medications are discontinued early at the onset



of TD, a significant number of patients will spontaneously



improve and perhaps even remit after a few months.



<P>



Unfortunately, for many patients, neuroleptic discontinuation is



not a viable option as the relapse rate for patients suffering



from schizophrenia exceeds 60 percent and 80 percent after one



and two years of medication respectively.



<P>



Various efforts to treat TD have been met with inconsistent



results. Some of these measures have included: benzodiazepines,



lithium, bromocriptine, tetrabenazine, reserpine, lecithin,



clonidin, and high does anticholinergics, to name a few.



<P>



Some recent intriguing approaches have included the use of



Vitamin E, and selegiline.



<P>



It appears that all medications that block D-2 dopamine receptors



in the brain have the potential of producing extrapyramidal



symptoms (eg, tremor, rigidity) and may cause TD.



<P>



Clozapine is very interesting in this regard. Clozapine has a



very weak affinity for D-2 dopamine receptors, and therefore,



rarely produces significant extrapyramidal symptoms at



therapeutic doses.



<P>



While there have been a few isolated cases of dyskinesias



associated with clozapine, in these instances patients had



received traditional neuroleptic drugs prior to clozapine. To



date, there have been no confirmed case of TD caused by clozapine



alone.



<P>



For this reason, clozapine is a very appealing drug in that it



can effectively control psychotic symptoms and yet has a very low



risks, if any at all, of producing TD.



<P>



It has been observed that moderate to high dozes of clozapine



(between 500 MG to 900 mg per day) may partially or completely



alleviate symptoms of TD -- especially in those patients with



tardive dystonia.



<P>



At Hillside Hospital in New York, we are currently conducting a



study to determine if clozapine is an effective treatment for



patients with moderate to sever tardive dyskinesia.



<P>



Preliminary results indicate that most of the TD patients show



dramatic improvement in their abnormal body movements.



<P>



This project is currently ongoing and we are seeking more



patients for this study to help us determine if clozapine merely



suppresses TD, treats TD, or spares the brain from intense D-2



dopamine receptor blockage thereby allowing spontanwous "healing"



of dopamine neurons in the brain.

<H2>Schizophrenia: The Current Basic Science</H2>
<A HREF="#kane"><H4>by John M. Kane, M.D.</H4></A>
 <HR>
	It has been apparent from twin, family, and adoption studies that schizophrenia is a disease with important genetic factors.  The recent advances in molecular genetic technology are now permitting much more rapid and precise analysis of potential linkages between specific chromosomes or regions of chromosomes and schizophrenia.  Although there are as yet no proven linkages, there have been a number of interesting leads.  Important developments that will facilitate further progress in this area are the mapping of the entire human genome and the establishment of large national and international data bases derived from persons with schizophrenia and their families.
<P>
	The fact that schizophrenia may not be a single disease with one cause makes finding the potential genetic factors more difficult.  It is possible that environmental factors (e.g., infectious agents) and other prenatal events may contribute.  It is likely that some aspect of the brains' actual development is affected in individuals with schizophrenia.  Potential evidence for specific problems include the possible effects of "unstable genes" similar to those observed in some neurologic diseases.  In these instances, genes fail to work properly and lead to abnormalities in the way the brain develops.  Another area of possible dysfunction is the way nerve cells grow together and along the right pathways.  Investigators are beginning to identify molecules that may be important in this process and that might be altered in some way in schizophrenia.  It has also been established that brain maturation involves the "pruning" of neurons, a normal process of eliminating extra nerve cells that occurs during adolescence.  This is a process that might be abnormal in schizophrenia and, if so, would help to explain why the disease usually becomes apparent in late adolescence or early adulthood.
<P>
	Molecular genetic techniques have been applied to the "dopamine hypothesis" of schizophrenia.  Since all proven-effective antipsychotic drugs block some type of dopamine receptor, new studies now being performed are attempting to link or associate the genes coding for specific dopamine receptors and schizophrenia.  Some groups, for example, have been able to predict clozapine response from studying genetic information relating to dopamine receptors in patients treated with this drug; however, other groups have not replicated those findings.  
<P>
	The fact that multiple dopamine receptors exist has been well established. In addition, there are other receptors in the brain that may be important in the etiology and/or treatment of schizophrenia.  The serotonin receptors have received increasing attention because of clozapine's effects.  There are now at least seven subtypes of serotonin receptors that can be studied.  Other receptors that may be important include norepinephrine, GABA and NMDA.  Studies of these receptors are now contributing to the development of new generations of drugs to treat schizophrenia that will have greater or lesser effects on specific receptors.  For example, a recent study suggesting that oral glycine might improve negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia supports the possible role of the NMDA receptor.
<P>
	Studies of brain structure and function have also advanced rapidly, benefiting from new technology in imaging techniques as well as post-mortem investigations.  Studies of first-episode patients at the onset of the illness (and prior to any medication treatment) have shown differences in specific brain regions as compared to control subjects.  Now such studies are even showing possible alterations in the functioning of cell membranes.  Such membranes are involved not only in how cells communicate with each other, but also in the energy metabolism on which cell survival depends.
<P>
	Studies employing other imaging techniques have shown alterations in brain metabolism in specific regions.  In some cases these abnormalities have correlated with the severity of specific symptoms.  Investigators have also found relationships between brain imaging measures and performance on tests of memory and thinking.
<P>
	Techniques for measuring brain waves or electrical impulses in the brain have also demonstrated abnormalities that may be related to the difficulty many patients have in processing sensory inputs and integrating them with or distinguishing them from their own thoughts.
<P>
	It is apparent from the findings in genetics, imaging, neuropsychology, and neurochemistry that there are biologically based core abnormalities in schizophrenia that are in all likelihood present before the obvious onset of the disease.  The fact that the human brain is so complex and that we are probably not dealing with a single disease under the heading of schizophrenia adds to the challenge of research in this area.  Nevertheless, enormous progress is being made, and the rate of advance is likely to increase.

<H2>Risperidone Research: Interview</H2>
 <HR>
<I>Paul Janssen, M.D., NAMI's Pioneer in Science Award recipient, discusses Haldol and Risperdal </I>
<HR>
The NAMI board of directors selected Paul Janssen, M.D., of Janssen Pharmaceutica--discoverer of both 
haloperidol (Haldol) and more recently risperidone (Risperdal)--as this year's recipient of the important 
Pioneer in Science Award.  This award recognizes outstanding, long-term contributions made by scientists 
in understanding and treating mental illness. Dr. Janssen has devoted his scientific career to easing the 
severe symptoms of psychosis. 
 <P>
The following interview with Dr. Janssen provides some answers to questions about his ground-breaking 
work. 
 <P>
You are known worldwide for synthesizing haloperidol (Haldol) in 1958.  Can you tell us how your 
discovery revolutionized the treatment of schizophrenia? 
 <P>
The synthesis of chlorpromazine, the first phenothiazine neuroleptic, began the revolution in the 
treatment of schizophrenia in the early 1950s.  Yet, chlorpromazine has many undesirable side effects--
sedation, anticholinergic (hallucinations, anxiety, short-term memory loss, disorientation, and agitation), 
cardiovascular, and neurological--to name a few, that limit the scope of its use.  Consequently, a sequence 
of phenothiazine derivatives were tested as possible alternatives to chlorpromazine.  The goal was to 
retain chlorpromazine's efficacy and to strip off some of its adverse reactions.  
 <P>
When haloperidol was marketed, it was possible for psychiatrists to treat schizophrenia with a high-
potency neuroleptic that was less likely to cause the adverse reactions associated with chlorpromazine and 
other phenothiazine and non-phenothiazine neuroleptics. 
 <P>
Haloperidol was made available in a variety of formulations: liquid, tablets of different milligram 
strengths, a short-acting formulation for intramuscular injection, and a formulation for intravenous use.  
These diverse formulations, coupled with haloperidol's pharmacological effects, made it possible to treat a 
larger number of people with schizophrenia than ever before. 
 <P>
Furthermore, haloperidol offered the advantage of being an effective treatment of the positive symptoms of 
schizophrenia and, secondarily, of some of its negative symptoms.  It can be safety coadministered with a 
large number of drugs that psychiatric patients--especially those with comorbid medical illnesses--must 
take.  Although haloperidol can evoke a variety of neurological side effects that are often dose-related, 
these can be managed by dose reduction or by counteracting drugs. 
 <P>
Finally, haloperidol maintenance therapy, properly administered, has proven to be safe and to preserve the 
benefits of haloperidol therapy.  Haloperidol's efficacy, safety, and assets are the reasons it has been used 
to treat millions of patients of all ages in the past 37 years, worldwide.  These properties of the drug 
account for it being the "gold standard" against which all new neuroleptics and antipsychotics are 
compared. 
 <P>
Why does your newest discovery, the antipsychotic medicine risperidone (Risperdal), represent a 
progressive step in the evolution of treatment for schizophrenia? 
 <P>
Risperidone, like clozapine, is a novel, atypical antipsychotic.  Each of these new medicines has advanced 
the treatment of schizophrenia.  Each is an effective therapy for acute schizophrenia, and each is also 
effective for chronic, treatment-resistant schizophrenia.  Risperidone and clozapine relieve both positive 
and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. 
 <P>
Risperidone and clozapine also are effective for a broad range of psychotic disorders besides 
schizophrenia.  The potentials of these two atypical antipsychotics make them true breakthroughs in the 
treatment of schizophrenia.  They make possible therapeutic achievements that have never been attained 
by their predecessors, the conventional, typical neuroleptics. 
 <P>
Risperidone and clozapine differ from their predecessors because each has different modes of action.  
They affect not only the neurotransmitter dopamine, but also the neurotransmitter serotonin.  Risperidone 
represents a true progressive step in the evolution of the treatment of schizophrenia for a number of 
reasons. 
 <P>
First, risperidone is effective against both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.  Second, 
risperidone's pharmacological properties make it safer than other atypical antipsychotics.  Unlike 
clozapine, it doesn't cause sedation, blood-pressure lowering, agranulocytosis (a dramatic drop in white 
blood cell count), seizures, excessive salivation, and other undesirable reactions. 
 <P>
In high doses, risperidone can cause neurological side effects, but these are infrequent because only a 
minority of patients require doses of risperidone high enough to evoke them.  In addition, these side 
effects are usually mild and readily managed by dosage reduction or by counteracting medicines.  
Risperidone's efficacy, safety, and tolerability make it an acceptable drug to a large number of patients 
with schizophrenia. 
 <P>
As psychiatrists become more skilled in the selection of candidates for risperidone and in managing its 
dose, it is reasonable to anticipate that--like haloperidol--it will become a leading drug for the treatment of 
schizophrenia and other psychoses and for a variety of other serious psychiatric illnesses. 
 <P>
In layman's terms, how does risperidone differ from haloperidol? 
 <P>
Risperidone differs from haloperidol in many very important ways.  Risperidone is unique.  It is a novel, 
atypical antipsychotic, whereas haloperidol is a typical neuroleptic.  Because risperidone is novel, it offers 
hope of relief from the suffering, anguish, and disability due to a variety of serious psychiatric illnesses 
without the adverse effects of typical neuroleptics, such as haloperidol. 
 <P>
Risperidone can be used to treat not only the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, but also to 
treat serious mood disorders, such as psychotic depression.  Like haloperidol, risperidone has anti-manic 
effects.  But unlike haloperidol, the dose of risperidone required to relieve mania is less likely to cause 
troublesome side effects. 
 <P>
Risperidone can be used for a variety of psychotic disorders, including psychoses induced by drugs.  
Risperidone and haloperidol are very good medications for treating the aggression resulting from many 
psychiatric and neurological disorders.   
 <P>
Because risperidone is less likely to cause certain side effects than haloperidol, risperidone can benefit 
elderly patients with dementia and organic brain disorders, adults and children with attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorders, and adolescents with Tourette's syndrome. 
 <P>
In short, risperidone has a broader range of application than haloperidol because of its unique 
pharmacological properties and better side-effect profile. 
 <P>
Do you see even more breakthroughs in drug therapy for serious mental illnesses? 
 <P>
Breakthroughs in drug therapy for serious mental illnesses are the hope and dream of dedicated 
pharmaceutical researchers everywhere.  Because there are many potential obstacles to the realizations of 
these aspirations, discoveries in this field are rare.  Proving that newly developed chemicals are potential 
antipsychotic, antidepressant, or antianxiety medications--or a mood stabilizer--is very time-consuming 
and costly because of the basic preclinical research and the extensive clinical and toxicological research 
that proof requires. 
 <P>
Nevertheless, there are valid reasons for researchers and pharmaceutical manufacturers to be sanguine 
about the future.  Yes, I foresee breakthroughs, but realistically they probably will be few and far between. 
 <P>
You yourself hold more than 100 patents, more than any other scientist in the world, and Pharmaceutical 
Executive magazine called your company "the most productive research-based drug company world-wide 
in the last 35 years."  Although you are formally retired, you remain involved in the research at the 
Janssen Pharmaceutica labs.  What keeps you so vitally interested in the work of your scientists? 
 <P>
I have been told I have an inquisitive mind and an insatiable desire to use my talents to develop new and 
better medicines to alleviate or minimize the ravages of the illnesses to which all people are prone.  It is 
true that I hold more patents than any other scientist in the world.  These are not just the fruits of my 
research alone. 
 <P>
Pharmaceutical research is very complex.  It requires the coordinated efforts of scientists, well-trained 
men and women whose vocations are to discover and develop new medicines for the welfare of mankind.  
Yes, although I am retired, I remain involved in research because it is challenging, exciting, and 
rewarding.  It also is a privilege to be associated with, and to exchange ideas and concepts with, loyal and 
dedicated employees who share my visions and dreams.

<H2>Schizophrenia and Modern Mental Health Services</H2></center>
<A HREF="#hogar"><H4>by Gerard E. Hogarty, M.S.W.</H4></A>
 <HR>
Since the introduction of effective antipsychotic medications, thousands if not millions of people world-wide who suffer from schizophrenia have been able to spend an increasing proportion of their lives outside the confines of a mental hospital.  In turn, quality of life has often improved with the availability of job clubs, resocialization groups, case management, sheltered or supported employment, residential opportunities, as well as legal and financial assistance.  These necessary services are not always available to all who need them, and even the more fortunate beneficiaries continue to experience periodic relapse and abiding cognitive impairments that conspire against a fuller social and vocational life.  It will come as no surprise to people and families who live day-to-day with schizophrenia to learn that only 10 percent to 30 percent of patients with schizophrenia are, on average, employed at any given time and that even a majority of those "successfully rehabilitated" though formal training programs often return to where they began one and two years later.  This is especially true when the rehabilitation support system ends its active involvement once a patient finds a job.
<P>
The promise of a better outcome can likely be found in the emerging science of "treatment development" that is being shaped and directed by contributions from the social, behavioral, and neurosciences.  These new approaches could more accurately be described as therapeutic interventions than mental health services because they are theoretically tied to the very impairments and disabilities of schizophrenia itself.  By contrast, "services" are usually atheoretical activities that are useful for all disabled human beings, whether the disability is mental or physical.  The following paragraphs will attempt to summarize a few of the more recent psychosocial treatment developments and provide a glimpse into what the future might hold.
<P>
Schizophrenia is a brain disorder and not the result of bad habits, bad parents, or bad friends.  What might be less well known is that the disease process itself (called the pathophysiology) can result in considerable vulnerability to what are often the "ordinary" events of daily life.  Thus, when social scientists set about the task of psychosocial treatment development nearly 20 years ago, they began with the notion that schizophrenia was an "environmentally sensitive" brain disorder.  Both good and bad experiences had the potential to seriously disrupt important psychobiological functions, such as attention and arousal, needed to process information about the world and to regulate one's emotional response.  These disturbances were believed to lie at the core of a psychotic episode.  Environmental stress that was capable of provoking episodes of schizophrenia could just as likely be found in the treatment environment itself (including one of our own early studies) as in the work environment, culture, or even normal family life.  In short, the cognitive demands associated with normal vocational and personal life could quickly exceed the capacity of many people with schizophrenia to respond appropriately.  
<P>


Psychoeducation
<P>
As simple as it now seems, basic information provided to patients and their families about the nature of schizophrenia, its treatment, how medication and psychosocial treatments work, and survival skills that enable them to better manage the illness have had important effects on reducing relapse and enhancing adjustment.  Not all psychoeducation studies have been positive, but the majority are encouraging.  Much like generic services, however, when the support of psychoeducational interventions ended, the treatment effect often did so as well.  Further, it has become clear that professional training and relevant credentials are required to accurately provide this needed information as well as the skill to "bridge the gap" between acquiring knowledge and applying it in everyday life.  Trips to the library are largely insufficient.  When we started "psychoeducation" in 1978, we encountered more than a bit of professional skepticism because the prevailing opinion at the time was that "families needed therapy, not advice."  But as often happens, the subsequent weight of research evidence gave lie to this popular myth.
<P>
Social Skills Training
<P>
Well-regarded attempts to improve the schizophrenic patient's ability to correctly understand, "digest," and respond to information from friends, family, and coworkers has also led to a reduction in schizophrenic relapse and to better adjustment.  Yet, many researchers continue to question whether the skills acquired in negotiating specific tasks involving specific people always transferred (or "generalized") to other social situations for which training had not been provided.  Quite simply, it would be nearly impossible to train a person to cope with every conceivable life experience, one at a time.  Unfortunately the story of our skills-training study was much like the psychoeducational approach:  when the support of the skills-training program ended, too often the good effects ultimately terminated as well.
<P>
Personal Therapy
<P>
In response to the short-term nature of treatment gains associated with educational and skills-training programs, we have recently completed the study of a new individual treatment for schizophrenia that comes a bit closer to what might be going on in the brain prior to a new episode.  The availability of an effective individual approach seemed of particular necessity in those parts of the country where mental health services were in short and diminishing supply or were not readily accessible.  Personal therapy was designed following a careful analysis of the internal (subjective) state and thinking among persons with a history of schizophrenia as they faced the beginning of a psychotic relapse.  Surprisingly, various studies suggested that psychotic symptoms themselves were not always the initial signs that a person was slipping into a new episode.  Rather, disturbances in feelings such as anxiety and restlessness or depression and sleep disturbance were frequently the first "symptoms" to appear.  These early warning signs, called "prodromes," were often the heralds of a serious and highly individual emotional upheaval, one that we have called "affect dysregulation."  
<P>
In the first three-year controlled trial of a psychosocial treatment ever attempted, personal therapy (PT) sought to help patients identify these very early subjective experiences (troublesome thoughts, body sensations, or emotions) and--depending on how well they had recovered from their last psychotic episode-- to teach them how to manage these prodromes before they escalated into a full-blown episode.  Early in the process of recovery, simple exercises such as avoiding "hot" situations were taught.  Over time, patients learned the techniques of relaxation as well as ways to rob a situation of its threat by means of re-evaluation, called "cognitive reframing."  Later, for those more fully recovered, strategies for managing criticism and unreasonable requests were introduced.  A deeper understanding of how one's feelings and their expression influenced the behavior of others was encouraged as well.  Unlike skills training that focused on the specific reaction to a particular stressor, PT addressed the more common and predictable reaction that a patient might typically have to any source of stress.
<P>
A very preliminary (unpublished) examination of an extensive database representing 150 patients has revealed some good--and some not so good--outcomes.  For patients living with their families, PT did significantly lower relapse over time.  But for those "living tough" on their own, it did not.  In fact, the practical problems related to obtaining stable housing, basic health care, and access to needed entitlements appear to have presented such a "full plate" to many patients that psychosocial attempts to develop management skills and greater awareness of their illness might have represented a destabilizing, cognitive "overload" for some of them.  When families were available to assist in the acquisition of basic human needs, patients seemed better able to make use of and profit from personal therapy in terms of lower relapse.  
<P>
For the first time, we have also been able to statistically isolate the independent effects of treatment on social recovery in a way that was not confused with marked treatment differences in relapse.  (In past studies, if one treatment had more relapses than another, then obviously this treatment would also have reduced the chance for social recovery.)  A very preliminary analysis suggests that personal therapy has had a positive influence--one that increases over time--on various aspects of social adjustment, particularly among patients living with family.  Ultimately, we hope to identify individual patients for whom PT has had the greatest effects.  In general, while most patients have been observed to be "better but not well," little positive improvement has been seen in the important area of work performance.  With the support of a NIMH Merit Award, my colleagues and I have recently decided to address the very core of schizophrenic impairments, disabilities, and social handicaps that underlie poor social and vocational performance.  A new intervention has been designed and called cognitive enhancement therapy.  We hope to test and evaluate it over the remaining years of the Decade of the Brain.
<P>
Cognitive Enhancement Therapy
<P>
Antipsychotic medications, including the newer "atypical" antipsychotic drugs such as clozapine and risperidone, have now made it possible for many more patients with schizophrenia to resolve the most prominent symptoms of their illness (e.g., hallucinations and delusions).  "But why," families and professionals ask, "do patients frequently continue to be unable to acquire a better social and vocational life, even though psychotic symptoms fade away?"  
<P>
Over the century, cognitive scientists have identified many "neuropsychological" problems that persist after symptom remission.  These frequently include difficulties in establishing, maintaining, or shifting attention, screening out or "inhibiting" less important information, using one's memory efficiently, problem solving, and most often, being able to process information about themselves and the world other than in a very slow and very "effortful" way.  As provocative as these findings in basic cognitive impairment have been, patients with schizophrenia nonetheless are not routinely hospitalized or isolated from friends and family "because their reaction time is slow," as one noted psychologist once remarked.  Rather, we now tend to regard these neuropsychological impairments as the smoke signals of what might be a far more serious cognitive fire.  Closer to the real-life consequences of these basic impairments are the practical disabilities demonstrated in the patients' "cognitive styles" of thinking.  Some styles are "impoverished," and persons with this cognitive style often have great difficulty giving a full and rich description of their own and another's ideas and behavior.  Another style is "disorganized," and these patients seem to get "off-track" quickly and easily digress into irrelevant discussions.  Often such patients "fail to edit" the first and often unrelated idea that pops into their heads.  Still other patients are disabled by a "rigid" cognitive style, one that makes it difficult to entertain more than a single, strongly held view of a problem, its solution, or for that matter, an alternative plan for getting on with life.
<P>
In trying to understand the source of these impairments and disabilities, we were struck by the fact that normal children, especially those between the ages of seven and nine, also showed many of the same poor neuropsychological test scores as adult patients with schizophrenia.  This led us to examine the social cognitive development of these pre-adolescents, and once again we concluded that their interpersonal behavior shared many similarities to those of adult persons with schizophrenia.  Perhaps, we thought, these social cognitive problems were the "inferno" that accounted for the everyday social handicaps of schizophrenia.  We concluded that many patients with schizophrenia (much like those who had "recovered" from traumatic brain injury) seemed to have lost, or failed to acquire, two essential social cognitive abilities needed for a fuller personal and vocational life.  
<P>
First, much like normal children, patients seemed to have difficulty in taking the view of another person, called "second-person perspective taking," or--better yet--taking "a third person-perspective" whereby one could examine their own and another's relationship from a "detached" point of view.  They appeared unable to see the big picture.  Second, and perhaps even more importantly, profound similarities between patients and normal children appeared in the form of difficulty "reading" or interpreting the informal and often subtle rules of conduct as social situations changed in an unpredictable way.  Social scientists have called this ability "secondary socialization."  For example, a patient being prepared for a library job was told that the general rule of the library limited the number of borrowed books to four at any given time.  One day, the director of the institution walked in and wanted to borrow a book.  The patient told him he couldn't have it because he has already taken out the allotted four books.  Needless to say, such misreadings of complex social situations can have disastrous vocational consequences.  Being able to take the place of another person and read social cues correctly are the foundations necessary for foresightful planning and a successful life.
<P>
Gratefully, modern cognitive theorists have shown that as a child's social cognition develops, mother nature provides an easy way out of the problem of trying to remember too many things (verbatim memory) and remembering them one piece at a time (serial processing).  As the child reaches adolescence, there is a slow emergence of abstract thinking where only the most important ideas, or rules, or principles underlying bits and pieces of information are remembered.  The irrelevant details are mostly forgotten.  The principles that are remembered are called "gists" as in, "I think he got the gist of it."  The brain process whereby this abstracting facility grows and develops is thought to be very complex.  What likely happens is that the development of essential brain circuits or "neural connections" increases during adolescence, while unnecessary circuits are eliminated--a process that could well be impaired in schizophrenia.  
<P>
With this as background, and in spite of very real and obvious obstacles, we have developed cognitive enhancement therapy in an attempt to "jump start" the process that nature originally intended, but that schizophrenia might have disrupted.  Using interactive computers, patients are first trained in "basic" cognitive exercises.  This training does not have the unrealistic goal of completely eliminating problems in attention and memory, but rather patients are trained to learn to get the "gist" needed to solve a problem.  Many props and aids are offered initially, but they are gradually faded out as the patient learns to internalize "the gist" or the rule governing the successful completion of a task.  Next, patients are paired in a way designed to help them "empathically" assist another patient as he or she also struggles to acquire the "gist" underlying a test.  Empathy is among the most unique and abstract of human abilities, yet is an essential behavior often ignored by health professionals during traditional psychosocial therapies.  
<P>
Finally, working in small groups, patients engage in exercises to help them acquire the ability to "get the gist" of rules that govern behavior in different social contexts.  Therapists gradually change the nature and the difficulty of these social cognitive exercises as patients begin to develop skills for the much needed "second person perspective" and "secondary socialization" abilities.  Throughout the program, these group experiences are supplemented by exercises in reading comprehension and "gist extraction" that often begin with the editorial pages of USA Today and proceed to the New York Times.  
<P>
We have only recently begun to treat patients in a formal, scientific study, but our pilot studies have shown some improvement, at least among selected patients.  Will it ultimately work for most?  Only time and a careful investigation will tell.  While some experts remain appropriately skeptical about the promise of cognitive rehabilitation itself, we are reminded of a remark made by a colleague who once said, "You only need to see one fly walk across the ceiling upside-down to know that it can be done".  We are also duly cautious about the future.  But with the abiding support of taxpayers and their elected representatives, this new era of cognitive rehabilitation does appear to offer hopefulness for a more lasting recovery from schizophrenia, an outcome that could exceed the limitations of existing mental health services.
<P>

<A NAME="hogar">About the author:  Gerard E. Hogarty, M.S.W., </A>is a professor of psychiatry at Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.  With degrees in philosophy and social work, Hogarty first held an appointment at NIMH, then joined the Friends Medical Science Research Center in Baltimore, where he conducted the first post-hospital, controlled-maintenance studies of drug and psychosocial interventions with patients with schizophrenia.  He moved to Pittsburgh in 1974, and he and his colleagues have continued to develop and test integrated medication and family psychoeducation as well as individual approaches to the care of patients with schizophrenia.  Among these were attempts to establish minimum effective dosing strategies for acute and maintenance treatment as well as studies addressed to the nature and treatment of impaired affect in those recovering from schizophrenia.  His current research program centers on the development of disorder-relevant, individual psychosocial treatments for schizophrenia, including a novel cognitive-rehabilitation approach.

<A NAME = "apers"><H2>A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IN RESEARCH</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>

<P>

I am a partner in research, but not in the usual sense.  I am the research--a volunteer subject at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), living for a year at their clinical center in Maryland.  I'm in the biological psychiatry research unit for affective disorders and participate in everything from medicine trials to PET scans, from memory and neuropsychological testing to blood and spinal-fluid testing, from MRIs to activity monitoring, from magnesium infusion studies to sleep and sleep-deprivation studies. 

<P>

Because I am a research subject, I am not given information that might affect the research results.  Most test results are blinded.  There are similarities in the patients who are selected.  We have all suffered with a bipolar I, bipolar II, or unipolar mood disorder and have tried standard treatments including medications, psychotherapy, and ECT.  Many are rapid cyclers; that is, the ups and downs of the illness cycle many times a year.  For a few, they actually cycle a couple of times a day.  Otherwise, we are all healthy people.

<P>

It would be misleading to tell you we have volunteered purely for research and the advancement of science.  Even though most of us would say, "I'm trading my time and body for research in exchange for the treatment I can't get back home," we are not as self-centered as that statement suggests.  I've seen patients go through a great deal of discomfort for research studies that will not benefit them directly.  

<P>

While NIMH allows us to refuse any test, patients try very hard to participate in them all.  For example, one patient with a phobia about small places successfully completed an MRI after several very scary attempts.  Her comment:  "I really wanted to do this because I know it's an important piece of research data."

<P>

I am 48 years old, married with no children.  I have a Masters degree and, when well, I hold a responsible marketing position with a large manufacturer of computer systems in New England.  I consider myself to be quite successful.  I also play hard whether I'm whitewater canoeing, skiing, or, before my illness, flying a small plane. 

<P>

The other patients in my group range in age from their early 20s to their mid-50s.  There are men and women--some single, some married--from all over the country.  They are well-read, bright, and knowledgeable about their illness.

<P>

Because the group is highly motivated, we've taken advantage of the resources at NIMH to learn more about our illness, particularly the weekly meeting led by our unit's research director.  After delivering the week's research schedule, he discusses research topics of interest to us, including recent discoveries.  Believe me, we get as excited as the researchers with every discovery.  Because our data are included, we take pride in the findings.  We helped, and maybe someday our help will in turn help us. 

<P>

One of the hard parts is remembering that in research some of the most exciting discoveries involve simply understanding the right questions to ask and investigate.  Many results will not become useful in treatment for a long time.

<P>

We do learn much about ourselves.  That's part of the return for volunteering.  Many of us are initially taken off meds for a "washout period."   While uncomfortable, it's often the first time in many years we've been medication-free, and it therefore provides an opportunity to re-observe our symptoms.  Sometimes it even results in a change in our diagnosis. 

<P>

Throughout the year we do ratings of mood, symptoms, and side effects several times a day.  We wear activity monitors to measure motor activity so it can be correlated with mood.  A life chart is prepared to record each participant's major life events as well as the course and treatment of the illness.  A life chart can be an eye-opener.  Some of us discover that the onset of our illness occurred much earlier than we thought, a fact that then becomes grist for future treatment.

<P>

About the future:  I anticipate leaving the program in close to a balanced state.  In my months here I've seen a number of patients discharged, and all of them were doing well when they left.  Some have had relapses, but their ups and downs aren't as intense.  With the NIMH data, their doctors at home are making treatment modifications that are generally working for them. 

<P>

And best of all, NIMH follows each of us for life; and our at-home doctors can consult with the NIMH doctors about our treatment.  We have access to the best of the best and the newest of the newest all the time.  I'm hopeful about what lies ahead.  I may not be able to continue with the demanding job I had; but I can still be productive, still be a good wife, and best of all, use the best treatments science has to offer for what looks like a lifelong illness for me.

<P>

<A NAME = "alter"><H2>ALTERNATIVE DRUG FOR ADHD</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>

<P>

Though the results are only preliminary, research has identified a potential new treatment for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that is just as effective as the controversial stimulant Ritalin and has few side effects.  The blood pressure drug Tenex significantly improved symptoms of ADHD in thirteen children and young adults, according to a study published in the January 1995 issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. 

<P>

Parents reported significant improvements in their children's overall behavior as well as in the specific symptoms of hyperactivity, inattention, and immaturity, after one month of Tenex treatment.  Tenex had few side effects.  The children were not sedated or impaired in their functional ability. 

<P>

They became significantly less restless, frustrated, and anxious, had less excessive energy, and were better able to finish projects.  They were more attentive, able to work with less supervision, and improved in some aspects of social skills.  Patients with the highest levels of irritability and hyperactivity seemed to benefit more from Tenex treatment.  For more information, call Mickey Nall at the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 202/966-7300.

<H2>"Drug Holiday" May Improve Sex Life</H2>
<HR>

	A new study conducted by Anthony J. Rothschild, M.D., clinical director of the mood and anxiety program at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., suggests that briefly discontinuing intake of certain antidepressants, or taking a "drug holiday," can improve a patient's sex life.  Drugs such as Zoloft and Paxil can reduce sex drive to a point at which some patients actually consider ending their relationship or quitting their treatment, researchers say.  Thirty volunteers taking either Zoloft, Paxil, or Prozac participated in Rothschild's study.  Not including the 10 subjects taking Prozac, 50 percent of the others reported a marked increase in satisfaction with sexual activity over the course of the four-weekend study.  All participants reported a return to previous sexual-dysfunction status after resuming antidepressant treatment.  The lack of a difference in results for persons taking Prozac, Rothschild said, "is presumably due to the longer period of time required for that medication to leave the individual's body once discontinued."<P>

<H2>Crisis Care for the Child or Adolescent With a Neurobiological Disorder</H2>
 <HR>
If severely ill and in risk of injuring himself or someone else, your child may need to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital or a residential treatment program.  
<P>
As the child's parent or guardian, you should expect to be part of the treatment plan, be told of all changes in medication and therapy plans, and, take part in the discharge plan.  
<P>
Generally, hospitalization for children and adolescents is brief.  Make sure that you know what alternative schooling programs are available and most appropriate for your child when he or she is discharged, especially if he or she is unable to return to his regular school program.
<P>
How do I pay for services for my child?
<P>
Mental health services, such as therapy, may be covered by your insurance plan.  Look at the mental health section of your plan to see what services it covers.  Many HMOs now require a gatekeeper other than a primary care physician be involved in determining whether mental health services will be provided.  If you, or your child is currently covered by a Medicaid program, some mental health services may be available.  Find out more about insurance plans and Medicaid from your local AMI or AMI-CAN affiliate.  
<P>
While hospitalized, special education programs mandated by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) are paid for under a set formula of county, state, and federal dollars.
<P>
I am told I must give up custody of my child because I cannot pay for services.
<P>
Some states require this; others do not.  The problem is how states interpret the law.  Treatment providers, as well as state child welfare authorities often explain that relinquishment is required by the federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (also known as P. L 96-272, or Title IV-E of the Social Security Act) or that treatment needs are best served if parents do not have the authority to remove their children from a treatment setting.  
<P>
In fact, such relinquishment is not required by federal law.
<P>
What do I do if I am not satisfied with a professional or a program where my child is placed for treatment or educational services?
<P>
Try to learn all you can about what the program or professional is supposed to do so you can judge carefully whether or not it's the right place or person to help your child.  If you are not satisfied, you need to express specifically what your concerns are.  You may need to seek a second opinion.  Learn about the laws that protect you and your child.  Speak up.  Ask questions.  Join an advocacy organization such as your local AMI and AMI-CAN that seeks better services in your community.
<P>
But most importantly, don't give up; your child needs your persistence.  Now, more than ever before, there are appropriate placements in schools.  If faced with serious unresolved concerns, you may need to consult a special-education lawyer to get the services your child needs.
<P>
Where can I find a support group of families whose children have neurobiological disorders?
<P>
Contact your local AMI affiliate.  (There are more than 1,000 affiliates throughout the U.S.)  They will tell you whether a child and adolescent group has formed in your area and where local support groups meet.  If you would like to form a support group for parents of children and adolescents, write to the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) and ask for the children and adolescent start-up packet.  This kit will enable you to start a group in your community as well as provide resource lists and ideas about advocating for the services you may need.
<P>
What are the advocacy goals of these groups?
<P>
Young families with children with neurobiological disorders are already advocating at all levels of government for improved services and access to services for children and adolescents.  The goals of advocacy include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>a total range of individualized and appropriate educational, treatment, and rehabilitative services;
<LI>a comprehensive, community-based system of care available to every child and adolescent in need of such services;
<LI>an end to the practice of forcing parents to give up custody of their children to obtain needed services;
<LI>the rights of children and adolescents to a free, appropriate public education and related services as mandated by federal, state, and local laws;
<LI>a change in public policy so that the needs of children and adolescents with neurobiological disorders are placed among the top priorities of the nation;
<LI>full family participation in planning for education and treatment;
<LI>full equity for children and adolescents with these disorders in the nation's healthcare and insurance systems;
<LI>research into causes, improved treatments, prevention, and cures for neurobiological disorders;
<LI>research into the most effective educational strategies, and improvement in the transition between adolescent and adult services.

<h1>Treating the Depressed Child</h1>
<h2>Looking at the Pros And Cons of Prescription Drugs </h2>

<em>By Jeanne Wright</em><br>

Special Thanks to The Washington Post<br>

Monday, December 2 1996; Page C05<br>
 The Washington Post
<p>

When a sad 5-year-old Fairfax County child tries to kill himself by lying in front of a school bus, or a frantic 10-year-old  holds a toy gun to his head and says he would pull the trigger if it were real, the nightmare of childhood depression becomes all too real.<p>
  For Rockville mother Brenda Souto, whose son was so despondent teachers once feared he might attempt suicide at school, raising a depressed youngster can be a terrifying struggle. <p>
For Susan Dubuque, whose son held the toy gun to his head, her son's battle with depression was a hellish journey that nearly ruined him. Today, Souto and Dubuque are among other parents who credit antidepressant medication like Prozac and similar drugs for literally saving their children's lives. <p>
"If he hadn't had this medication [Prozac], I think he probably would have eventually become so miserable . . . he would be one of the suicide statistics," says Souto of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill in Arlington.<p>
 Up to 8 million youngsters suffer from depression in this country, according to Peter Jensen of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in Bethesda. Increasingly, children as young as 4 and 5 years old are being treated with Prozac and other antidepressants that belong to the new breed of drugs called SSRIs, serotonin-reuptake inhibitors.<p>
     Though it's difficult to determine exactly how many children in this country are treated with antidepressants for either depression or other mental problems, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, doctors have some clue by reviewing information collected by IMS America, a firm that tracks data from the pharmaceutical industry.<p>
      IMS, since 1992, has tracked the number of times, called "mentions," that physicians prescribed, refilled, recommended or administered SSRIs to children.<p>
      For children in the 5- to 10-year-old age group, IMS found that the number of "mentions" of Prozac grew from 61,000 to 220,000 between 1992 and 1994.<p>
      The most recent figures -- for June 1995 to June 1996 -- show 3,000 SSRI drug "mentions" for children up to age 4. For youngsters ages 5-10, the number of times doctors prescribed, refilled or administered the drugs was 116,000. The number of "mentions" for ages 16-20 was 899,000 in that 12-month period, according to IMS figures. <p>
Though Jensen and other mental health experts believe antidepressants can be highly effective for some children who have been properly diagnosed, there still is concern that not enough is known about the safety and efficacy of these drugs for young children and that more research is needed. Research involving children and drugs like Prozac has been scant compared with studies on adult usage, says Jensen, chief of Child and Adolescent Disorders Research at NIMH in Rockville.<p>
Nevertheless, Jensen says he, like other doctors, resorts to medication for a depressed youngster when all other behavioral therapies and counseling have failed to lift the child from the depths of serious depression.<p>
"I cannot allow this child to suffer longer," says Jensen. "If we've given it our best shot, then we'll do a therapeutic trial of medication, even though we do not have all the firm evidence we would like to have."<p>
  Harold S. Koplewicz, vice chairman of psychiatry and director of child and adolescent psychiatry at New York University Medical Center, worries that mentally and emotionally disturbed children who could greatly benefit from medication are not being treated because of the stigma attached to giving children antidepressants and a failure to accept that the child's problems may stem from a mental illness or brain disorder.<p>
"People actually believe that parents are the cause of the children's problems and if the parent is giving a pill or medicine to the child, it's because you haven't been a good parent," said Koplewicz, author of "It's Nobody's Fault, New Hope and Help for Difficult Children and Their Parents" (Times Books, Random House 1996).<p>
 "The real dilemma is not are we over-medicating our kids, but are we under-treating them," says Koplewicz. "If these children have a real depression, a real illness and it is unresponsive to psychosocial interventions, they need a treatment that will make it go away."<p>
 Left untreated, the results can be disastrous, he warns. "If teenagers feel bad and we don't help them with this depression, they will go and treat themselves. They will find `medicines' they think will work -- cocaine, alcohol and marijuana. Then you have a kid that is not only depressed, but suffering from substance abuse."<p>
Results of an important new study at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas -- yet to be published -- may provide doctors with the best recommendation so far for prescribing the SSRIs to youngsters.<p>
   Conducted by Graham Emslie, a professor of psychiatry, and funded by the NIMH, the study showed Prozac to be effective in treating depressed children and teenagers. Ninety-six patients suffering from severe and persistent depression, ages 8 to 18, were studied for eight weeks. Fifty-six percent of those who had received Prozac responded to treatment, compared with 33 percent in a group that received a placebo.<p>
It's the first study -- especially with young children -- that showed Prozac was more effective than the placebo, according to Emslie. Hopefully, he says, this will foster more research in this age group and result in more depressed children receiving treatment. <p>
  Despite these results, Emslie also worries about possible long-term effects. "The difficulty with children is clearly that the brain is still developing. So, we don't know how the medications affect that. We have no data that says it's harmful. But it's always a concern."<p>
"On the other hand," says Emslie, "we have some data that suggests being depressed for a period of time can affect your brain functioning over time." Data show changing of blood flow to the brain and other neurological signs, so researchers can see "biological changes occurring in the state of depression," he says. "So, if you don't treat it you have danger of more permanent changes in the brain occurring."<p>
 Mental health experts like Neal Ryan, professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh, stress that the newer SSRIs are much safer than the older group of antidepressants called tricyclics. <p>
"I think they (SSRIs) will be the first-line treatment everywhere," Ryan predicts.<p>
 SSRIs have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for adult use only. The drugs carry a warning label that they have not been tested on children. Doctors, however, can prescribe for children.<p>
 "Medication has taken such a lambasting," says parent Susan Dubuque of Richmond, whose son, Nicholas, now 12, has taken Ritalin, Prozac and other antidepressants over the years to treat disorders. <p>
"There have been certain cases of abuse and misuse. But I'll tell you when it works it really works," says Dubuque, who has written "A Parent's Survival Guide to Childhood Depression," published this year by the Center for Applied Psychology Inc.<p>
    Burned into her memory is that terrifying night Nicholas cowered in a closet, pointed a toy gun to his head and threatened to kill himself if it were real. She said he was hysterical, crying and pleading, "Please help me."<p>
   After years of dealing with a child's anger and sadness and seeking medical help, Dubuque says it's frustrating to deal with critics who don't understand the severity of depression in children and what it is like to raise such a child.<p>
   "People say, `Instead of giving the child a pill, why don't you find out what is wrong with him.' I just want to say, `I did. I have. And the problem is he's depressed.' The reality is it's a physical disorder. You wouldn't say, `Don't give your child insulin if he is a diabetic.' " <p>
A Bethesda mother said her young son's depression became so deep that by the age of 12 he was suicidal and she had to "hide all the knives in the house."<p>
"It was scary. He talked about feeling useless and [that it was] not worth living. He left the house one day for a long walk and later told his therapist that his plan had been to walk out in front of cars and be killed." <p>
 He has since been treated off and on with Prozac and Zoloft for depression and the stimulant Dexedrine for attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity.<p>
Though his bouts with depression have lifted somewhat, "I'm afraid to take him off medication," she says. "I fear the risk of suicide. If I can just get him through the teenage years alive, then the rest of his life may work out."<p>
     It was long thought that young children could not be depressed, so depression in children was likely misdiagnosed or overlooked, according to Jensen. In the last couple of decades that all has changed, and now there is a sense of urgency in the medical field to diagnose and treat children who suffer from depression. <p>
In fact, beginning in 1997, the most comprehensive nationwide study on children and mental disorders in this country will be conducted by the NIMH, in conjunction with other agencies, including the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the Department of Education, and Center for Mental Health Services. <p>
The study will survey about 14,000 children, ages 4 to 17, and monitor them for a minimum of two years, according to Jensen. The goal is to learn more about the causes of mental disorders in children, how they are being treated, the quality of care, and why some kids are falling through the cracks either through misdiagnosis, insurance problems or other faults in the system.<p>
     Children under stress, who experience a traumatic loss, or who have learning, attention or conduct disorders are typically at a higher risk for depression, according to experts at the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry.<p>
         Early diagnosis and treatment is critical for children suffering from depression.<p>
        The behavior of depressed children often can differ from the behavior of depressed adults, say doctors. Signs of depression in youngsters can include persistent sadness, boredom or low energy; inability to enjoy previously favorite activities; increased irritability; frequent complaints of physical illnesses; major changes in sleeping or eating patterns; frequent absences from school or poor performance in school. <p>
Children and adolescents who are depressed may say they want to be dead or talk about suicide. Depressed adolescents may abuse alcohol or drugs as a way to feel better. And sometimes children who cause trouble at home or school may be depressed but not know it, according to the Academy.<p>
     School educators, counselors and psychologists often are among the first to observe symptoms of depression or other disorders in children. <p>
Fairfax County school psychologist Martha Ozer is among those who have seen the heartbreak of childhood depression.<p>
"I've seen where a child writes `I wish I were dead' or `I'm going to kill myself' on a paper  that they were going to turn in and they knew the teacher would see it," recalls Ozer, who works with elementary school children . <p>
"We take it very seriously because very young children don't really understand death and they don't understand that when people die it is final," she says.<p>
       When a child talks of suicide, parents are asked to take their child for an emergency evaluation by a mental health professional. If they refuse to address the problem, Ozer says the school must call Child Protective Services for the child's own safety.<p>
        "Lots of times it is just so horrifying to a parent that a child would talk of killing [himself] that they just can't believe it so they may not actually follow up immediately."<p>
         She recalled one child who made an attempt -- a suicidal gesture -- in class. "It was a cry for help. It could have been more serious than it was." <p>
    In another case, a 5-year-old distraught over family problems lay down in front of his school bus in an attempt to kill himself. Fortunately he was not injured, says Ozer. Another suicide threat came from a child whose family was having financial difficulties, and the youngster "thought it would just be best for the family not to have her around any more."<p>
      "Today, some children are under tremendous stress . . . certainly more so than 20 years ago," says Ozer. "Children and families live very fast-paced lives and many times both parents work outside the home and there are child-care givers. Just the issue of who cares for the child is an issue that can cause stress."<p>
      "School curriculums are at a faster pace and lots of activities sometimes leave kids stretched to the limit and it's difficult for them," Ozer says. "It can leave them with not enough down time or enough time when a child can actually relate to the parent."<p>
        Jensen also cites societal changes like divorce rates and increased mobility as possible factors that can lead to depression. "One might argue that life is more complex and more difficult and in some ways more stressful than in earlier years," says Jensen.<p>
      Environmental factors, like kids' exposure to lead, have been shown to result in more behavioral problems, he says. Since depression can be biological, doctors note that depressed children often have a parent who has suffered from the disorder.<p>
Elizabeth Weller, professor of psychiatry, pediatrics and neuroscience at Ohio State University, worries that not all children are being properly evaluated and diagnosed before being prescribed antidepressant medication.<p>
  "When you look at the average pediatrician who spends around 11 minutes per patient and a family practitioner, seven minutes . . . you can't diagnose a little kid in that period of time. Paper-pencil tests are not even made to make the diagnosis and come up with a score saying this kid is depressed. But based on that they give the medication. It is really sad," says Weller. "If you give it to the properly diagnosed child it really helps," she adds.<p>
But constraints placed by managed care often bar doctors from being able to spend enough time with young patients to reach a clear diagnosis.<p>
 Even Dubuque has worried about the uncertainty over possible long-term drug risks.<p>
 "I'd be stupid not to," she says. "But when you are dealing with a child who is suffering from an acute bout of an emotional problem, you take crisis action. If we wouldn't have, there may not have been a long term to worry about."<p>

<H2>Manic Depression:  Scanning The Genome For A Cause</H2>
<HR>			


	Three reports in the April 1996 issue of Nature Genetic 
present important advances in the search for genetic causes of 
bipolar affective disorder, better known as manic depression.  Of 
all the psychiatric disorders, sorting out the hereditary basis of 
bipolar disorder has proven tremendously difficult, with one claim 
after another proving inconclusive or unconfirmed.  The new 
studies--using various strategies in different population groups--
provide strong clues on where to focus the gene search, although 
the situation in clearly complex.
<p>
	Researchers Blackwood and colleagues in Edinburgh focussed on 
one large family of more than 100 individuals, with 11 suffering 
from bipolar disorder, and found strong evidence for a gene on the 
short arm of chromosome 4, which held up when the study was 
expanded to include 12 other families.  Ginns and an intramural 
team at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) looked at 
551 genetic markers in affected Amish families (long popular with 
geneticists because of their large size and excellent genealogical 
records).  Their results suggest that three locations--on 
chromosomes 6, 13, and 15--may harbor susceptibility genes.  
Finally Freimer (an NIMH grantee) and his colleagues examined an 
isolated population in Costa Rica, resulting in evidence of a gene 
on the long arm of chromosome 18.

<H2>"Working Memory" and Schizophrenia</H2>
<HR>	



	While you are keeping something in mind, just where exactly is it kept?  Neuroscientists think they have an answer.  They believe 
they have located what amounts to the brain's scratch pad, where information is held temporarily when it is needed for some current task.
<p>
	New techniques for observing the brain in action are revealing that neurons in the prefrontal lobes, just behind the forehead, hold 
specific kinds of information for short-term use.  These neurons appear to be the neural basis for the mind's "working memory," which 
operates, say, when you dial a phone number.  "We've found cells for working memory in the prefrontal cortex that retrieve and temporarily 
hold information pulled from long-term memory stores that are dispersed throughout the brain," said Dr. Patricia Goldman-Rakic, a 
neuroscientist at Yale Medical School who has done much of the research.  The neurology of working memory, which is more widely known 
by the now outmoded term "short term" memory, may hold a vital clue to what goes wrong in the thinking of people with schizophrenia.
<p>
	"Working memory is the mental glue that links a though through time from its beginning to its end," said Dr. Goldman-Rakic.  
"The bizarre thought disorders in schizophrenia, especially the inability to keep a train of thought from getting derailed, could be due to a 
defect in working memory."  The new findings are consistent with theories of neuropsychology, largely based on clinical studies of brain-
damaged patients, that view the prefrontal region as the brain's executive center for making decisions, planning, and executing behavior.  
The key executive function of the prefrontal cortex, Dr. Goldman-Rakic argues, is working memory.
<p>
	One clinical implication of the work on the prefrontal cortex and working memory is the potential for a better understanding of 
some schizophrenia symptoms, such as the derailment of the train of thought.  Blood-flow studies of people with schizophrenia have shown 
that the prefrontal areas are often interactive, and these people also have difficulty in the same visual tracking tasks that Goldman-Rakic has 
used in her studies of working memory.  "The prefrontal areas receive a high concentration of dopamine, and drugs effective in treating 
schizophrenia act on dopamine receptors," said Goldman-Rakic.  She points out that a fairly new drug for schizophrenia, Clozapine, both 
increases dopamine release in the prefrontal areas and improves patients' thinking and memory.

<H2>Impaired Serotonin Activity Can Be Seen In People With Depression</H2>
<HR>


	Using brain-imaging techniques, researchers have seen--for the first time--inadequate activity involving the brain chemical 
serotonin in people who have major depression.  Such a causal link between depression and serotonin activity had been hypothesized by 
researchers for more than a quarter century, and research had proceeded based on this hypothesis--but without direct visual evidence until 
now.
<p>
	In the study reported in the February issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry, doctors from the New York State Psychiatric 
Institute, Columbia University, and the University of Pittsburgh compared six healthy people to six people with major depression who had 
not been medicated for at least two weeks.  Using a serotonin-releasing drug, doctors observed significant increases, as well as decreases, in 
metabolic activity in the left and right regions of the brain in the healthy patients but not in patients with depression.

<H2>MOOD DISORDERS: DEPRESSION &amp; . . .</H2>
<hr>

Mood Disorders: Depression &amp; Manic Depression
<P>
"Recurrent mood disorders," "major affective disorder," "major
depression," and "manic depressive illness" are terms used to
describe the most common group of serious psychiatric conditions.
<P>
These conditions involve periodic disturbances in mood,
concentration, sleep, activity, appetite, and social behavior. In
the United States alone more than 20 million people will
experience a mood disorder during their lifetime. Many cases,
unfortunately, go unrecognized and untreated.
<P>
The most common types of these illnesses are: Major depression
(non-bipolar or unipolar), Bipolar disorder (manic depression)
<P>
In the last 10 years much time and energy have been spent by
medical researchers to understand better these disorders and to
find more effective means of treating them.
<P>
Modern treatments are effective and safe and usually allow
persons with a recurrent mood disorder to live useful and
productive lives.
<P>
This pamphlet was prepared to help explain the course of these
disorders, how they may affect one's life, and how they can be
treated.
<P>
What is "affective disorder"?
<P>
The term "affect" refers to one's mood or "spirits." "Affective
disorder" refers to changes in mood that occur during an episode
of illness marked by extreme sadness (depression) or excitement
(mania) or both.
<P>
"Mania" describes periods of abnormal elation and increased
activity while "depression" describes an abnormal degree of
sadness and melancholy. The same person may have periods of mania
and depression.
<P>
Occasionally, the disease presents a combination of manic and
depressive symptoms. If untreated, these episodes tend to recur
or persist throughout life.
<P>
What are the symptoms?
<P>
The most common symptoms are changes in sleep pattern, level of
daily activity and energy, appetite, mood, self-esteem, thinking,
speech, sex drive, and interpersonal relations.
<P>
In periods of excitement (hypomania) an exaggerated sense of
well-being (euphoria) or irritability may be experienced. The
rate of thinking is markedly increased.
<P>
Intellectual activity takes place with lightning speed, and there
is great frustration with family and friends who do not
immediately accept or become engaged with such "flights of
ideas."
<P>
During a period of depression there may be persistent feelings of
sadness and emptiness, tearfulness for no apparent reason, or
irritability and hostility toward others.
<P>
Mental speed and activity are usually lowered; ideas are fewer.
There is a poverty of thought, and responses to the environment
are painfully slowed.
<P>
Family members may be surprised by dramatic changes in mood that
seem to have no obvious association with life events.
<P>
Although nearly everyone experiences periods of sadness as well
as periods of well being, people with affective disorders during
an episode of illness experience these emotions to an extreme
degree.
<P>
There are two basic types of episodes -- periods of depression
and periods of mania.
<P>
Periods of depression are characterized by:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>-- Poor appetite and weight loss or the opposite, increased appetite and weight gain
<LI>--  Sleep disturbance: sleeping too little or sleeping too much in an irregular pattern
<LI>--  Loss of energy: excessive fatigue or tiredness
<LI>--  Change in activity level, either increased or decreased
<LI>--  Loss of interest or pleasure in usual activities
<LI>--  Decreased sexual drive
<LI>--  Diminished ability to think or concentrate
<LI>--  Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt which may reach grossly unreasonable (delusional) proportions
<LI>--  Recurrent thoughts of death or self harm, wishing to be dead or contemplating or attempting suicide
</UL>

<P>
Periods of hypomania or the more severe state of mania are
characterized by:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>--  Persistently "high" (euphoric) or irritable mood states
<LI>--  Appetite disturbance
<LI>--  Decreased need for sleep
<LI>--  Increased activity
<LI>--  Increased sexuality
<LI>--  Pressured speech
<LI>--  Racing thoughts
<LI>--  Loss of self-control and judgment
</UL>

<P>
In the bipolar or manic-depressive form of affective disorder,
both depressive and manic cycles occur. Usually a period of
depression follows a period of hypomania or mania, or the
reverse. Sometimes they are separated by periods of normal or
near normal functioning.
<P>
Does it go away?
<P>
The onset of the first episode of an affective disorder may not
be obvious. Some people have infrequent brief, mild episodes do
not seek treatment or even recognize that they are ill. 
<P>
Typically, episodes of illness are time-limited: they come and
go, last from several days to several months, and are followed by
relatively normal periods of mood behavior.
<P>
Without treatment, the frequency of illness, as well as the
severity of symptoms, tends to increase over the years. Less
often, a person may have only rare episodes of illness.
<P>
Manic and depressive episodes present differently in different
persons, and there are even differences in one person from one
episode to the next.
<P>
Does being depressed change feelings about oneself?
<P>
Mood has a strong influence on what one thinks from moment to
moment. During periods of depression one often dwells on memories
of losses or failures.
<P>
Negative thoughts may take over, such as: "I can't be worth
much," "No one really cares about me," "The world is terrible,"
or "My parents hate me."
<P>
Since these episodes may last for several months or longer, one's
morale or self esteem may become seriously impaired. Prolonged
periods of depression can lead to the wish to die or even to
thoughts of killing oneself.
<P>
If one goes through cycles of being "up," does that change the
way one things and feels about oneself?
<P>
Many individuals who have experienced the "highs" of
manic-depressive illness describe feeling better than at any
other time of their life.
<P>
They cannot understand why anyone would call their experience
abnormal or part of an illness. They feel excited, have surges of
energy, describe feeling more creative, active, more intelligent,
more sexual, able to accomplish things they never thought
possible. Sleep seems unnecessary. Life plans and decisions are
often out of proportion with the individual's realistic abilities
and resources.
<P>
Thus, the "high" periods of hypomania and mania can leave a false
sense of one's abilities that may be difficult to give up. They
may be followed by crashing into despondency after the "high" has
run its course.
<P>
Decisions made during these periods are typically impulsive and
reckless. Spending sprees and other indiscretions (sexual,
alcoholic, etc.) are common.
<P>
These periods of feeling great exaltation, self-importance and
power can cause confusion and loss of contact with reality --
often more obvious to others than to the person experiencing
this elated mood state.
<P>
This unrealistic euphoria seems to be a common cause of not
complying with recommended treatment -- a lapse that can,
unfortunately, lead to recurrent and incapacitating illness.
<P>
What is the usual outcome of a mood disorder?
<P>
More than 75 percent of individuals with the illness respond well
to medical treatment; nearly all patients respond at least
partly.
<P>
Most individuals who seek treatment and follow the
recommendations of their doctor can lead productive, useful, and
reasonably stable and satisfying lives.
<P>
Without proper medical treatment, many such persons suffer
repeated periods of illness, hospitalization, and loss of
productive living.
<P>
What are the treatments for mood disorders?
<P>
Mood disorders are medical illnesses that produce emotional
symptoms. A common-sense treatment plan involves treating the
medical symptoms as well as learning how to recognize one's own
patterns of illness and developing ways of coping with them.
<P>
In addition to taking the medication prescribed by the doctor,
many patients and their families find it helpful to obtain
supportive counseling.
<P>
Treatment is directed at lessening the duration and intensity of
the episodes and preventing recurrences. It is helpful to have
accurate records of the intensity and duration of past episodes
to provide comparisons for current treatment efforts and to
determine whether there is a regular seasonal vulnerability.
<P>
What medication is taken for bipolar disorder?
<P>
The medication lithium carbonate was introduced for the treatment
of mania and bipolar affective disorder in the early 1950's. It
has a powerful mood stabilizing effect and can be used safely. It
is not a sedative, but prevents extremes of mood, either high or
low.
<P>
Lithium's main benefit lies in the prevention of episodes and in
treating an episode after it has occurred. Manic and depressive
attacks occur less frequently and are less severe when lithium is
taken regularly.
<P>
Individuals with recurring manic depressive (bipolar) and some
forms of recurring depressive (unipolar) illness are often
treated with lithium. When taken regularly and at a correct
dosage, there is no sedation or other effects on awareness or
mental functioning.
<P>
What medical tests are needed before on starts taking lithium?
<P>
A medical evaluation including medical history, physical
examination, and simple laboratory tests of blood and urine are
needed.
<P>
Because lithium is almost entirely eliminated from the body by
the kidneys, laboratory tests of kidney function are done before
starting lithium and at regular intervals thereafter.
<P>
Tests of thyroid function are also advised since lithium may
occasionally cause goiter (a harmless, treatable enlargement of
the thyroid gland) or a mild decrease in thyroid function
(hypothyroidism). A blood test of the level of thyroid hormones
is usually done at regular intervals.
<P>
How is a lithium dosage determined?
<P>
There is a simple, inexpensive blood test to measure the level of
lithium in the blood, so the correct dosage can be precisely
determined for each patient.
<P>
Initially lithium levels are checked every few days (taking a
blood sample about 12 hours after the last evening dose). Once
the correct blood lithium level is reached, lithium levels
typically are measured monthly or less often. The day of a blood
test, no lithium should be taken until after the test.
<P>
How long will one need to take lithium?
<P>
Whether a person should remain on long-term therapy after an
episode has ended depends on many individual factors.
<P>
It is a decision requiring close cooperation and discussion
between a medical specialist, the individual, and the family.
<P>
Many individuals need not be on long-term lithium treatment.
Treating someone for a mild illness or one that is not likely to
recur for many years, if ever, unnecessarily exposes him to all
the potential risks and expenses that come with prolonged use of
any drug.
<P>
Unfortunately, it is rarely possible to predict with confidence
who will fall into this more favorable group.
<P>
Some individuals may have only a single episode of affective
illness. How long someone remains on lithium following a single
episode of mania or hypomania involves a careful individual
decision, usually based on the previous severity, duration, and
pattern of recurrence of illness in the patient.
<P>
If episodes are minor or widely separated, long-term medication
may not be necessary. It is usually best to continue treatment
for at least a few months after recovery from an acute episode of
mania, especially if it is severe enough to require
hospitalization. Those with more severe and frequent episodes
will likely need to take lithium indefinitely.
<P>
What kinds of lithium preparations are available?
<P>
Several preparations of lithium are available. Most are simple
300 mg lithium carbonate tablets or capsules. Others are in
slow-release form, and a liquid preparation of lithium citrate is
sometimes used.
<P>
The choice of lithium preparations is based on individual
preference and cost. Capsules are sometimes preferred because
tablets may have an unpleasant taste. When it is necessary to
regulate the dose in 150 mg rather that 300 mg increments, scored
tablets or liquid preparations are used.
<P>
Individual requirements for lithium vary consider ably. Some
patients take 900 mg or 1200 mg of lithium carbonate in a single
dose without distress, while others require several small doses
of 150 mg to 300 mg over the course of the day.
<P>
What are the side effects of lithium? Can they be prevented?
<P>
Lithium is non-sedating and side effects are rare. It is not
addicting. It is safe at appropriate dosages, although when taken
in excess it can produce intoxication and potentially dangerous
side effects.
<P>
While common, most side effects are both harm less and easily
dealt with. Stopping treatment is rarely necessary.
<P>
The following early side-effects are common and usually subside
in several days:
<P>
--  Gastrointestinal symptoms: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
stomach ache (such side effects can usually be alleviated through
adjustments of dosage and timing of administration.
<P>
Simple changes, such as taking few tablets or capsules at one
time, taking them on a full stomach, or with a glass of milk, are
often effective.)
<P>
<UL>
<LI>--  Hand tremor
<LI>--  Fine tremor of the hands at rest (It usually be gins early in treatment, although it may appear at any time, may vary, and may or may not go away over time.)
<LI>--  Thirst and frequent urination
<LI>--  Fatigue, a dazed feeling, muscle weakness
</UL>

Late side effects include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>--  Hand tremor (Individuals inconvenienced by continued tremor beyond the first weeks of treatment should seek relief of the condition without interrupting their treatment. In consultation with physician, a lower dose may prove effective. If this is not possible, the addition of small doses of propranolol (Inderal) often produces a beneficial effect.)
<LI>--  Severe thirst and frequent urination (These symptoms may be reversed by waiting a few weeks, lowering the dose of lithium, or by careful use of a thiazide diuretic (water pill) such as Diuril, under doctor's supervision.)
<LI>--  Urinary incontinence (This may occur in some women. It can usually be helped by decreasing the dose of lithium or adding other medicine (with anticholinergic action) under a doctor's advice.)
</UL>
<P>

These common side effects of lithium therapy occur in perhaps 40
percent of those using this medicine. Symptoms usually begin
early in treatment, although they may appear for the first time
after months or even years of treatment.
<P>
Although they may not pose a great concern, they should be
promptly reported because they may signal a change in the level
of lithium in the blood.
<P>
What are the dangers of taking too much lithium?
<P>
With the exception of single large overdosages, lithium poisoning
or intoxication is usually of gradual onset. The signs of
beginning lithium intoxication include loss of appetite, vomiting
and diarrhea, fatigue, weakness, unsteadiness, slurred speech,
muscle twitching, and severe shakiness.
<P>
Although poisoning is rare with careful medical supervision, it
is important to be aware of these symptoms and to recognize them.
<P>
Severe intoxication or poisoning can lead to seizures, confusion,
coma, and possibly death. Clearly, the daily lithium intake must
not be increased without consulting the doctor.
<P>
What about taking other medications while on lithium?
<P>
Those receiving lithium, especially for the long term, may need
to take other medication at some time. Other drugs may be used to
supplement lithium in treating a mood disorder, or they may be
used coincidentally with lithium to treat unrelated medical
conditions.
<P>
Lithium and diuretics (water pills for high blood pressure): The
elimination of lithium from the body is linked to removal of
sodium by the kidneys.
<P>
Most diuretic drugs (water pills) alter this excretion pattern of
both sodium and lithium. A decrease in dietary sodium intake can
result in a potentially dangerous increase in lithium in the
blood.
<P>
Dietary extremes of sodium (salt) intake should be avoided. Low
salt diets, especially when combined with water pills, can result
in lithium retention to the point of intoxication.
<P>
Most diuretics get rid of sodium from the body and can cause
retention of lithium. Since these drugs are usually prescribed by
general physicians or internists, it is important that patients
and their doctors be aware of this interaction.
<P>
Lithium need not be stopped when diuretic drugs are used but the
lithium dose will almost certainly have to be lowered to maintain
serum levels of lithium in a safe, therapeutic range.
<P>
Lithium and Antipsychotic Medicines: Lithium is sometimes used
together with major tranquilizers (such as Mellaril, Thorazine,
Prolixin, Haldol, and Navane), or benzodiazepines -- Valium-like
drugs -- (Klonopin and Ativan) especially in the initial phase of
treatment of acute mania. These two classes of drugs have been
safely used together for years in thousands of patients.
<P>
Are there reasons not to take lithium?
<P>
Lithium may be harmful to a developing fetus. Every effort should
be make to avoid taking lithium during early pregnancy.
<P>
Women planning to get pregnant or who become pregnant while
taking lithium, should tell their doctor immediately so lithium
can be stopped. Similarly, a mother should not breast teed her
baby it she is taking lithium.
<P>
It a doctor advises that it is not sate to stop lithium during
pregnancy, the dose should be the smallest possible to provide a
low but therapeutic level.
<P>
Because of changes in the way the body deals with lithium during
pregnancy and at delivery, serum determination of lithium is best
checked frequently. Wide fluctuations in the mother's blood
lithium concentration are best avoided by use of repeated small
doses.
<P>
Some patients may be unable to take lithium because of side
effects or medical contraindications. For others, lithium may be
ineffective or may produce an incomplete response. There are
alternatives for these individuals.
<P>
Studies completed in the past few years in Japan and the U.S.
show that two drugs introduced for the treatment of epilepsy,
carbamazepine (Tegretol) and valproic acid (Depakene) can be
effective for acute mania, perhaps have antidepressant properties
and work to prevent future episodes.
<P>
A number of patients who failed to respond to carbamazepine
alone have responded well to a combination of lithium and
carbamazepine.
<P>
What are treatments for major depression?
<P>
For individuals who have infrequent or recurrent periods of
depression only, anti-depressant medication is effective.
Research shows that medication coupled with supportive counseling
provides the most effective treatment.
<P>
Some depressed patients have only one episode of major depression
and never relapse. In such cases, long-term anti-depressant use
would not be necessary.
<P>
Who should have continued drug treatment has not been defined
exactly. The number of depressive episodes and their severity
help decide the benefits and risks.
<P>
Lithium seems to prevent relapses of recurrent depression in some
unipolar patients. Electroconvulsive therapy may be effective in
serious cases resistant to other treatments.
<P>
Recent clinical experiences sounds a cautionary note for bipolar
patients using tricyclic antidepressants or monoamine oxidase
inhibitors during their depressions. For some, their use may induce
hypomania or mania, and over time the frequency of cycles may be
increased. Careful monitoring and restricted use for limited periods
of time in bipolar patients is indicated.
<P>
Several types of drugs are used in the treatment of acute or
recurrent depression. All share similar beneficial side effects,
but may have different side effects.
<P>
The usual daily oral dosage for a typical antidepressant
(Imipramine, Tofranil, and others) is about 150 to 300 mg. For
most age groups, antidepressants may be taken safely at one time,
usually at bedtime. Antidepressants typically take effect slowly.
<P>
It may take 3 to 4 weeks or longer for the relief of some
symptoms of depression (especially low energy and depressed or
irritable mood) while insomnia may improve within a few days. 
<P>
Sometimes patients think that the medicine is not helping if they
don't feel better immediately, but they should keep taking it for
at least several weeks at an adequate blood level.
<P>
Some of the most commonly prescribed preparations of the most
common type of antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants) are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>-- Amitriptyline (Amitril, Amitriptyline, Elavil, Endep)
<LI>-- Desipramine (Pertofrane; Norpramine)
<LI>-- Doxepin (Sinequan)
<LI>-- Imipramine (Antipress, Imavate, Imipramine, Presanubem SK-Praamine, Tofranil)
<LI>-- Nortriptyline (Aventyl, Pamelor)
<LI>-- Protriptyline (Vivactyl)
</UL>

<P>
What are the side effects of antidepressants?
<P>
Before starting antidepressant treatment, a doctor should explain
the possible side effects of the prescribed antidepressant. If
not, ask about them! The most common are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>-- Dry mouth
<LI>-- Blurred vision
<LI>-- Sweating
<LI>-- Dizziness when moving from a sitting to a standing position, sedation or over-stimulation
<LI>-- Difficulty urinating; constipation
<LI>-- Rapid pulse, or rarely, irregular heart rhythms
<LI>-- Tremor
<LI>-- Weight gain
</UL>

<P>
These side effects often decrease with time, or can be diminished
by lowering the dosage or changing to another antidepressant.
<P>
Are there other kinds of antidepressants?
<P>
Some studies have shown that monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors
are effective in individuals who have "atypical" depressions with
marked anxiety, hypersomnia, and craving for sweets, who may have
accompanying preoccupation with their health (hypochondriasis),
irritability, agoraphobia (fear of open or crowded spaces),
social phobias or lack of energy.
<P>
What are the possible side effect of MAO inhibitors?
<P>
<UL>
<LI>-- Postural hypotension (dizziness when standing up)
<LI>-- Headaches
<LI>-- Flushing
<LI>-- Sedation
<LI>-- Severe high blood pressure (hypertensive crisis) if certain foods, beverages, or medicines containing tyramine are taken
</UL>

<P>
What are the dietary and drug restrictions when taking MAO
inhibitors?
<P>
Certain foods and medicines can interact with MAO inhibitors to
produce potentially dangerous high blood pressure. These foods
are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>-- Aged cheeses (cottage cheese and cream cheese are safe)
<LI>-- Beer and wine (especially Chianti)
<LI>-- Chopped liver
<LI>-- Yeast products (e.g. Bovril used in gravies, Marmite)
<LI>-- Sour cream and yogurt
<LI>-- Broad beans (fava beans)
<LI>-- Pickled herring
<LI>-- Chocolate
<LI>-- Medicines that can produce hypertensive crisis in combination with MAO inhibitors (including stimulants and anti asthma medicines)
</UL>

<P>
These foods and medicines should be avoided. Over-the-counter
medicines (including sleeping pills and cold tablets) or any
prescribed medicines should not be used without checking with the
psychiatrist or family doctor.
<P>
Serotonin uptake inhibitors are among the newly developed
antidepressants that act selectively on a specific
neurotransmitter system.
<P>
The first antidepressant of its type to be marketed in the United
States, Flouxetine (Prozac) acts directly on the serotonergic
system, has relatively few side effects and for this reason has
become widely prescribed.
<P>
The dosage is between 20 mg to 80 mg a day, with most individuals
requiring no more than 20 mg for the relief of symptoms. Usually
3 to 5 weeks are required for antidepressant effect.

<H2>Depression and Healthcare Use</H2>
<HR>
	According to a study in the October Archives of General Psychiatry, depression doubles healthcare use.  The study of 6,000 
depressed patients in a Seattle HMO found that they make twice as many general medical and specialty visits, incur double the pharmacy 
costs, and use twice as many lab, radiology, and other services as persons without depression.  Only 20 percent of the visits were for mental 
illness.

<H2>Bipolar Risk</H2></center>

 <HR>



	According to an article in the fall 1995 NARSAD Research Newsletter ("Advances in Genetics of Psychiatric Disorders" by Anne Brown), "For bipolar disorder, if an individual has one affected parent, the risk of developing the disorder is 27%, and if both parents are affected, the risk increases to 74%.  For schizophrenia, the corresponding risks are 9% and 46%."

<H2>Hope For Those Who Require Long-Term Care?
The Forgotten Population</H2>
 
by Rose Marie Friedrich and Curtis B. Flory
<HR>			

There is growing evidence that there is a subgroup of persons with severe 
brain disorders (mental illnesses) whose symptoms are largely untouched by 
current treatment or rehabilitation efforts and who may require long-term 
supervised living arrangements.  The term "the forgotten population" seems 
appropriate for this group because their needs are often overlooked in the 
closure of hospitals and the planning and implementation of community 
services.  These individuals can be found in jails and prisons, among the 
homeless, in nursing homes and care facilities, and even in family homes.  
They remain largely hidden from view and forgotten.
<p>
Although the exact number of individuals who are the most severely affected by deinstitutionalization and inadequate community resources for long-term care is unknown, a preliminary sense of this population follows:
<p>
Diagnosis of schizophrenia

<UL>
<LI>Persons with schizophrenia are the severely mentally ill group most at risk for chronicity and severity of symptoms.  Because of lack of adequate community services they are often homeless, imprisoned and in nursing homes.

<LI>Approximately 40 percent of persons with schizophrenia do not respond well to current treatment.  This is equal to approximately 720,000 persons.

<LI>Seventy-four percent of neuroleptic-responsive outpatients become noncompliant within two years.  The consequence of noncompliance accounts for at least 40 percent of all episodes of schizophrenia relapse and at least one-third of all acute inpatient costs.
</UL>

<p>
Diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder

<UL>
<LI>Approximately 20 percent of persons with bipolar affective disorder do not respond well to current treatment.  This is equal to approximately 220,000 persons.

<LI>Although the majority of persons with this disorder lead essentially normal lives, they too are among those in nursing homes and imprisoned as a result of inadequate community resources.
</UL>


<p>
Concurrent alcoholism/substance abuse
<P>
An estimated 50 percent to 60 percent of brain-disordered inpatients have co-existing alcoholism or substance abuse.

<p>
Concurrent chronic medical diagnosis
<P>
Impairments of daily living are often compounded by physical incapacities among persons with severe brain disorders.  Chronic brain disorders frequently go undiagnosed and untreated.  Little health-services research has been done in this area.
<p>
Deinstitutionalization has severely reduced access to inpatient care that extends beyond a few weeks' time.  The magnitude of deinstitutionalization is evidenced by the following:

<UL>
<LI>The average daily census of state psychiatric hospitals dropped from 559,000 in 1955 to 92,000 in 1990, an 83.5 percent decrease.

<LI>The availability of psychiatric beds has been reduced from 11 per 100,000 in 1986 to 5.2 per 100,000 in 1990 in spite of the concurrent reduction in availability of state hospital capacity.

<LI>The average length of stay in hospitals has been dramatically reduced.  From 1969 to 1988 the average stay in private hospitals went from 39 days to 26 days--a reduction of 33 percent.  Since 1988 there have been further drastic reductions in length of stay in psychiatric units in private and general hospitals.
</UL>

<p>
Community resources have failed to compensate for the decline in hospital care.  In many cases, resources are not available to meet basic human needs (shelter, food, and medical care).  Rehabilitation services are largely unavailable, leaving persons with little or no ongoing care.  This failure has resulted in:
<UL>
<LI>Jailed severely mentally ill:  At least 30,700 severely mentally ill are in jail, and approximately twice that number are in prison.  Schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder are the major diagnoses of those incarcerated.

<LI>Homeless severely mentally ill:  One third of 600,000 homeless suffer from severe brain disorders.  Schizophrenia is common among the long-term homeless.

<LI>Nursing homes:  Approximately 194,300 persons with severe brain disorders live in nursing homes.  Of those, 27 percent (52,451) are under 65 years of age.  Nursing homes house large numbers of individuals with schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder.

<LI>Household population:  As many as two-thirds of persons with severe brain disorders live with their families, who often become service providers by default because of the gaps in existing mental health services.  The impact on families is enormous, leading to physical illnesses and severe psychological stress among family members.

<LI>Group homes:  Of particular concern is the limited number of group homes.  Only 32,328 live in this setting.  In spite of positive outcomes from a structured environment for those who are the most severely ill, there is a growing movement to locate this population in independent living arrangements with limited support.

<LI>Suicides:  Suicide is an increasingly common outcome of failed deinstitutionalization and lack of adequate community services.  About 10 percent of those with schizophrenia and 15 percent of those with mood disorders commit suicide.  This is in contrast to the rate of 1 percent for the general population.

<LI>Rehospitalizations:  The rate of rehospitalizations is increasing, with many readmitted 20 to 30 times.

<H2>DUAL DIAGNOSIS: SUBSTANCE ABUSE &amp; . . . </H2>
<hr>

Dual Diagnosis: Substance Abuse And Mental Illness
<P>
By Agnes B. Hatfield, Ph.D.
<P>
Families who have mentally ill relatives whose problems are
compounded by substance abuse face problems of enormous
proportions.
<P>
Mental health services are not well prepared to deal with
patients having both afflictions.  Often only one of the two
problems is identified.
<P>
If both are recognized, the individual may be bounced back and
forth between services for mental illness and those for substance
abuse, or they may be refused treatment by each of them.
<P>
While the picture regarding dual diagnosis has not been very
positive at this point, there are now signs that the problem is
being recognized and there is an increasing number of programs
trying to address the treatment needs of people with both
problems.
<P>
Research studies are beginning to help us understand the scope of
the problem.  It is now generally agreed that as much as 50
percent of the mentally ill population also has a substance abuse
problem. 
<P>
The drug most commonly used is alcohol, followed by marijuana and
cocaine.  Prescription drugs such as tranquilizers and sleeping
medicines may also be abused.  The incidence of abuse is greater
among males and those in the age bracket of 18 to 44.
<P>
People with mental illnesses may abuse drugs covertly without
their families knowing it.  It is now reported that both families
of mentally ill relatives and mental health professionals
underestimate the amount of drug dependency among people in their
care. 
<P>
There may be several reasons for this.  It may be difficult
to separate the behaviors due to mental illness from those due to
drugs.  There may be a degree of denial of the problem because we
have had so little to offer people with the combined illnesses. 
<P>
Caregivers might prefer not to acknowledge such a frightening
problem when so little hope has been offered.
<P>
Substance abuse complicates almost every aspect of care for the
person with mental illness.  First of all, of course, these
individuals are very difficult to engage in treatment.
<P>
Diagnosis is difficult because it takes time to unravel the
interacting effects of substance abuse and the mental illness. 
<P>
They may have difficulty being accommodated at home and may not
be tolerated in community residences of rehabilitation programs. 
They lose their support systems and suffer frequent relapses and
hospitalizations.
<P>
Violence is more prevalent among the dually diagnosed population.
<P>
Both domestic violence and suicide attempts are more common, and
of the mentally ill who wind up in jails and prisons, there is a
high percentage of drug abusers.
<P>
Given severe consequences of drug abuse for the mentally ill, it
is reasonable to ask:  "Why do they do it?"  
<P>
Some of them may begin to use drugs or alcohol for recreational
use, the same as many other people do.  Various factors may
account for their continued use.
<P>
Probably many people continue their use as a misguided attempt to
treat symptoms of the illness or the side effects of their
medications.  They find that they can reduce the level of anxiety
or depression -- at least for the short term.
<P>
Some professionals speculate that there may be some underlying
vulnerability of the individual that precipitates both mental
illness and substance abuse.  They believe that these individuals
may be at risk with even mild drug use.
<P>
Social factors may also play a part in continued use.  People
with mental illnesses suffer from what has been called "downward
drift." 
<P>
This means that as a consequence of their illness they may find
themselves living in marginal neighborhoods where drug use
prevails.
<P>
Having great difficulty developing social relationships, some
people find themselves more easily accepted by groups whose
social activity is based on drug use.  Some may believe that an
identity based on drug addiction is more acceptable than one
based on mental illness.
<P>
We realize that this overview of the problem of drugs and mental
illness is not a very positive one.  However, we believe there
are some encouraging signs that better understanding of the
problem and potential treatments are on the way.  
<P>
Just as families have faced other very troublesome problems in
the past and developed adequate responses to them, we believe
that they can learn to deal with this one in a way that their
lives become less troubled and their relatives begin receiving
better treatment.
<P>
Treatment Programs For The Dually Diagnosed
<P>
As many families have probably discovered, service systems have
not been well designed with this population in mind.  Typically a
community has treatment services for people with mental illness
in one agency and treatment for substance abuse in another.  
<P>
Clients are referred back and forth between them in what some
have called "ping-pong" therapy.  What is needed are "hybrid"
programs that address both illnesses together.  Development of
these programs locally requires considerable advocacy efforts.
<P>
Limitations Of Traditional Drug Treatment Programs
<P>
Treatment programs designed for people whose problems are
primarily substance abuse are generally not recommended for
people who also have a mental illness.
<P>
These programs tend to be confrontive and coercive and most
people with severe mental illnesses are too fragile to benefit
from them.  
<P>
Heavy confrontation, intense emotional jolting, and
discouragement of the use of medications tend to be detrimental. 
These treatments may produce levels of stress that exacerbate
symptoms or cause relapse.
<P>
Characteristics Of Appropriate Programs
<P>
Desirable programs for this population should take a more gradual
approach.  Staff should recognize that denial is an inherent part
of the problem.
<P>
Patients often do not have insight as to the seriousness and
scope of the problem.  Abstinence may be a goal of the program
but should not be a precondition for entering treatment.
<P>
If dually diagnosed clients do not fit into local Alcoholics
Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) groups, special peer
groups based on AA principles might be developed.
<P>
Clients with dual diagnosis have to proceed at their own pace in
treatment.  An illness model of the problem should be used rather
than a moralistic one.
<P>
Staff needs to convey understanding of how hard it is to end an
addiction problem and give credit for any accomplishments.  
<P>
Attention should be given to social networks that can serve as
important reinforcers.  Clients should be given opportunities to
socialize, have access to recreational activities, and develop
peer relationships.  Their families should be offered support and
education.
<P>
Advocacy For Effective Treatment
<P>
If no appropriate programs exist in the community, families of
dually diagnosed persons may need to advocate for them. 
<P>
References at the end of the paper describe a number of
experimental programs that can serve as sources of information. 
Advocacy should also be directed at research and training.
<P>
An example of a recommended program is one conceptualized by
Sciacca (1987).  It uses an educational approach and recognizes
the tendency for dually diagnosed individuals to deny their
problem. 
<P>
The patient does not have to recognize or publicly acknowledge
that he or she has a problem.  Patients meet in a group and talk
about the issue of substance abuse, view videotapes and involve
themselves in helping others.
<P>
Only later do members get around to talking about their problem
and the potential for treatment.  A nonconfrontational style is
maintained throughout.
<P>
Rather than send participants to AA or NA, members of these
groups are invited to visit the agency.  Eventually some of
Sciacca's groups do go to AA and NA.
<P>
Family Management And Coping
<P>
It is difficult enough to cope with problems presented by a
relative's mental illness, but when substance abuse is also a
problem, family stress can be multiplied.  These families need
all the help they can get to help them cope with the additional
burdens they face.
<P>
Recognizing The Problem
<P>
It was stated earlier than many families do not recognize that
their mentally ill member also has a substance abuse problem. 
<P>
This is not surprising because many of the behavioral changes
that lead to suspicion of drug problems in other people, already
exist in persons with mental illness.
<P>
Therefore, such behaviors as rebelliousness and argumentiveness
or being "spacey" may be less reliable clues in this group.
Observation of some of the following behaviors, however, may put
families on the alert:
<P>
-- Suddenly having money problems
<P>
-- Appearance of new friends
<P>
-- Valuables disappearing from the house
<P>
-- Drug paraphernalia in the house
<P>
-- Long periods of time in the bathroom
<P>
-- Dilated or pinpointed eyes
<P>
-- Needle marks
<P>
Of course, there are also those individuals who react strongly to
drugs and alcohol and whose unusually chaotic behaviors leave
little doubt regarding the use of drugs.
<P>
Confronting The Problem
<P>
Confronting the problem may or may not involve confronting the
individual.  It is usually best not to immediately and directly
accuse the individual of using drugs because denial is a likely
response.
<P>
Unless one has irrefutable evidence, the person is entitled to be
presumed innocent.  What one can object to are behaviors, whether
or not they are known to be influenced by drugs, which are
interfering with family life.
<P>
These behaviors may take any number of forms:  apathy,
irritability, neglect of personal hygiene, belligerence,
argumentiveness, and so forth.
<P>
Since the problem of drug use is a very serious and complicated
matter, it should be addressed in a careful deliberate manner.
<P>
It is best not to try to deal with the individual when he or she
appears to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, nor when
family members are feeling most emotionally upset about the
situation.
<P>
Avoid making dire threats such as calling the police, resorting
to hospitalization, or exclusion from the home unless you really
mean to do it.
<P>
There is a risk that you may say things under the stress of the
situation that you don't mean.  It is important that your
relative knows where he or she stands with you and that you mean
what you say.
<P>
Develop A Plan Of Action
<P>
Since it is likely to be difficult at best, select a time when
things are relatively calm to decide what to do.  Involve as many
members of the family as possible and develop an approach all can
agree upon.  The following set of guidelines may help you come up
with a plan:
<P>
1.  Be sure that all members agree on what the problem is.  What
exactly have members observed that has to be dealt with?  Is it
some unacceptable behavior that might be caused by drugs or is
there clear evidence of drugs?  What is the evidence?
<P>
2.  Generate a number of possible solutions to the problem with
the goal of acting on the one(s) that all agree are the best
one(s). Of course, families will differ a great deal in what they
think is possible in their situation.
<P>
What follows is a hypothetical family who might come up with some
of the following suggestions:
<P>
-- Relate your concerns to your relative's psychiatrist or
therapist.
<P>
-- Confront him or her with your observations and request very
specific changes in behavior.
<P>
-- Plan ways to reduce access to money that might be going for
drugs.
<P>
-- Do anything possible to reduce his or her needs for or
interest in
social groups that use drugs.
<P>
-- Confront the person with clear evidence that he or she is
using
drugs and suggest treatment.
<P>
3.  Come to an agreement about what may be the best approach to
try first.
<P>
4.  Develop very specific steps to carrying out your plans. 
Decide what role each member will have in implementing the plan. 
If there is a decision to confront the person directly about drug
use, be prepared to give the evidence.
<P>
State calmly that you believe drug use is occurring, provide the
evidence, and what you want the person to do about it.  Refuse to
get in an argument with the person.
<P>
Have a definite plan in mind, including a contact with an
available treatment center, telephone numbers, etc., so you can
proceed immediately if he or she should agree to treatment.
<P>
It is important to avoid a moralistic tone about drug use.  It is
better to focus on the consequences that you have observed for
the person and for his or her family.  
<P>
If the family decides that the problem is serious and the
individual is likely to be lax about compliance with the family's
reasonable requests, then negative consequences may be considered
for failure to comply.
<P>
This must be weighed very carefully.  It is not easy to think of
negative consequences for adults that one can enforce and, as we
have said before, it is never wise to make threats that you don't
intend to carry out.
<P>
For the usual misbehaviors, the person should be asked to make
amends or the person may lose a privilege he or she enjoys.  When
problems get so severe that other members are at risk, the person
may be forewarned that he or she will be asked to leave.
<P>
Then the family must follow through.  This works better if
alternate housing can be arranged ahead of time so that the
streets do not become the only option.
<P>
Families often ask if the family should insist on total
abstinence from all drug use.
<P>
While authorities in the field point out that abstinence is by
far the safest option, some families may find that tolerance of
occasional use or agreement to cut back may get reasonable
cooperation whereas insistence on total abstinence will result in
denial and inability to communicate further on the subject.
<P>
Recreational drugs and alcohol and prescribed medications might
have serious interactive effects.  Clients and families need to
be fully informed about these possibilities.
<P>
Support And Self-Care For The Rest Of The Family
<P>
Coming to terms with chemical dependency of a mentally ill
relative does not come easily.  For a time, it just feels too
painful, too bewildering, too overwhelming to face.
<P>
The family may feel terribly angry at the person and blame him or
her for seeming so stupid, so weak willed as to add problems of
substance abuse to an already highly disturbed life.
<P>
Feeling angry and rejecting unfortunately does not help the
situation and delays rational thinking about how to approach the
situation.
<P><P>
Parents and siblings may be hurt because the addicted person
blames others for his or her problems and breaks trust by lying
and stealing, and in general, creates chaos throughout the
household.
<P>
A great deal of fear and uncertainty may prevail as behavior
becomes more irrational and violence or threats of violence
increases.  Members of the family may feel guilty because they
feel their relative's substance abuse is in some way their fault.
<P>
It is important, first of all, to realize that substance abuse is
a disease.  The person who is truly addicted is no more able to
take control of this problem without help than he or she is able
to take control of his mental illness.
<P>
Thinking of this problem as a disease may reduce the sense of
anger and blame.  Family members may learn to take negative
behaviors less personally and feel less hurt.
<P>
People may cease blaming themselves and each other for a disorder
that no one could have caused or prevented.
<P>
Coming to terms with substance abuse in someone you love will
take time.  It will be easier if the family can close ranks,
avoid blaming each other, agree on a plan of action, and provide
support to each other.
<P>
It is also important to seek support from other families who are
dealing with dually diagnosed relatives.  This subset of families
in the local Alliance of the Mentally Ill may find it beneficial
to meet separately at times to provide support in a way best done
by other people who also have the problem.
<P>
Families may want to investigate their local Alcoholic Anonymous
(Al-Non) and/or Narcotics Anonymous (NA) groups.  These support
groups have proven to be immensely helpful to some families.
<P>
Finally, it is important to say that families cannot stop their
relative's substance abuse.  They can, however, avoid covering it
up or doing things that make it easy for the person to continue
the denial.
<P>
Families can learn what they can do about the problem, but they
must be realistic that much of it is out of their hands.  With
great efforts some of the painful emotions will subside, members
will feel more serene, and life can be worthwhile again.
<P>
Twelve Things To Do If Your Loved One Is Addicted To Drugs And/Or
Alcohol
<P>
1.  Don't regard this as a family disgrace.  Recovery from an
addiction can come about just as with other illnesses.
<P>
2.  Don't nag, preach or lecture to the addict/alcoholic. 
Chances are he/she has already told him or herself everything you
can tell them.  He/she will take just so much and shut out the
rest.  You may only increase their need to lie or force one to
make promises that cannot possibly be kept.
<P>
3.  Guard against the "holier-than-thou" or martyr-like attitude.
<P>
It is possible to create this impression without saying a word. 
An addict's sensitivity is such that he/she judges other people's
attitudes toward him/her more by small things than spoken words.
<P>
4.  Don't use the "if you loved me" appeal.  Since the
addict/alcoholic is compulsive and cannot be controlled by
willpower, this approach only increases guilt.  It is like
saying, "If you loved me, you would not have tuberculosis."
<P>
5.  Avoid any threats unless you think it through carefully and
definitely intend to carry them out.  There may be times, of
course, when a specific action is necessary to protect children. 
Idle threats only make the addict/alcoholic feel you don't mean
what you say.
<P>
6.  Don't hide the drugs/alcohol or dispose of them/it. Usually
this only pushes the addict/alcoholic into a state of
desperation. In the end he/she will simply find news ways of
getting more drugs/liquor.
<P>
7.  Don't let the addict/alcoholic persuade you to use drugs or
drink with him/her on the grounds that it will make him/her use
less.  It rarely does.  Besides, when you condone the
using/drinking, he/she puts off doing something to get help.
<P>
8.  Don't be jealous of the method of recovery the
addict/alcoholic chooses.  The tendency is to think that love of
home and family is enough incentive for seeking recovery.
<P>
Frequently the motivation of regaining self respect is more
compelling for the addict/alcoholic than resumption of family
responsibilities.  You may feel left out when the
addict/alcoholic turns to other people for helping stay sober. 
You wouldn't be jealous of the doctor of someone needing medical
care, would you?
<P>
9.  Don't expect an immediate 100 percent recovery.  In any
illness, there is a period of convalescence.  There may be
relapses and times of tension and resentment.
<P>
10. Don't try to protect the recovering person from
using/drinking situations.  It's one of the quickest ways to push
one into relapse.  They must learn on their own to say "no"
gracefully.  If you warn people against serving him/her drinks,
you will stir up old feelings of resentment and inadequacy.
<P>
11. Don't do for the addict/alcoholic that which he/she can do
for him/herself.  You cannot take the medicine for him/her. 
Don't remove the problem before the addict/alcoholic can face it,
solve it or suffer the consequences.
<P>
12. Do offer love, support and understanding in the recovery.

<A NAME = "antip"><H2>ANTI-PSYCHOTICS UNDER DEVELOPMENT</H2></A>

<P>

The following anti-psychotic agents are presently in various stages of development and trial for approval.  (Information from NARSAD Research Newsletter, summer 1994.)



<P>



Seroquel (dibenzothiazepine)



<P>



Seroquel is a novel anti-psychotic agent intended for treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.  It exhibits a high affinity for brain serotonin type 2 (5-HT2) receptors and a low affinity for D2 receptors, a profile similar to that of clozapine.



<P>



In early clinical trials, Seroquel appears to be a safe an well-tolerated agent with low EPS (extra pyramidal syndrome).  Like clozapine, Seroquel does not appear to cause increase serum prolactin levels.  (Elevated serum prolactin levels are frequently associated with standard anti-psychotic agents and can result in unwanted side effects in women such as breast tenderness and milk discharge.)



<P>



The most frequently reported adverse effects in initial clinical trials include somnolence, dizziness, agitation, insomnia, and headache.  Unlike clozapine, agranulocytosis has not been observed on Seroquel, and  it is hoped that routine monitoring of the white blood cell count will not be required.  Zenaca Pharmaceuticals expects Seroquel to be available in the marketplace in late 1995.



<P>



Lanzac (olanzapine)



<P>



Olanzapine possesses anti-psychotic activity with a low tendency to evoke EPS.  In its early trials, Lanzac is showing promise a an atypical anti-psychotic.



<P>



Unlike standard anti-psychotics, which improve mainly positive symptoms, patients taking Lanzac exhibited fewer positive and negative symptoms.  Thus far, no agranulocytosis and only transient increases in prolactin levels have been reported.  Eli Lily is in phase III of its clinical trials for Lanzac.



<P>



Sertindole



<P>



Sertindole has been shown in animal studies to have selectivity for the dopamine neurons that project to the limbic system (thought to be involved in the production of psychotic systems) rather than the dopaminergic neurons that project to the basal ganglia (believed to be involved in the production of EPS).  It has been suggested that clozapine acts in a similar way.



<P>



Serindole has been found to be generally well tolerated with minimal EPS side effects during the phase II trials just completed.  Discovered and patented by H. Lundbect A/S (Copenhagen, Denmark), Serindole is licensed to Abbott Laboratories for development in the United States and Canada.  A new drug application is expected to be filed in 1995.



<P>



Ziprasidone (CP-88,059)



<P>



Ziprasidone, a combined 5HT2/D2 antagonist (meaning it blocks these particular receptors), bears some pharmacological similarity to respiridone, a newly approved anti-psychotic with a low incidence of EPS when taken at low to moderate doses.  Ziprasidone is an inhibitor of norepinephrine reuptake, a property it shares with some antidepressant medications.  Pfizer has just initiated phase III trials in the United States and Europe.

<A NAME = "antid"><H2>ANTIDEPRESSANT CLEARED FOR U.S. USE</H2></A>



<P>



Nefazadone HCI (Serzone), a new antidepressant that blocks presynaptic reuptake of serotonin that has been reported to be unlike currently available SSRIs was cleared recently by the FDA.  Already approved for routine clinical use in Canada and the United Kingdom, nefazadone's dual mechanism of action could be related to the fact that it poses a reduced risk of an array of side effects that have been associated with increases in postsynaptic 5-HT2 stimulation. 



<P>



These include the agitation now associated with a number of SSRI agents, the sleep disturbances associated with both depression and use of SSRI agents, and suicide ideation, which has also been associated with an up-regulation of 5-HT2.



<P>







<A NAME = "benzo"><H2>BENZODIAZEPINES</H2></A>



<P>







What You Need to Know About Benzodiazepines



<P>



Common benzodiazepines:



<P>



<B> BRAND NAME...GENERIC NAME</B><br>



 Ativan ..... lorazepam<br>



 Azene ..... chlorazepate<br>



 Centrax ..... prazepam<br>



 Clonopin ..... clonazepam<br>



 Dalmane ..... flurazepam<br>



 Halcion ..... triazolam<br>



 Librium ..... chlordiazepoxide<br>



 Paxipam ..... halazepam<br>



 Restoril ..... temazepam<br>



 Serax ..... oxazepam<br>



 Valium ..... diazepam<br>



 Xanax ..... alprazolam<br>



<P>



Everyone experiences anxiety at one time or an other --



"butterflies in the stomach" before giving a speech, sweaty



palms during a job interview, or occasional sleeplessness. Other



symptoms of anxiety include irritability, uneasiness, jumpiness,



feelings of apprehension, tight muscles, rapid or irregular



heartbeat, stomach ache, nausea, faintness, and breathing



problems.



<P>



Anxiety is often manageable and mild. But some times it can



present serious problems. A high level or prolonged state of



anxiety can be very incapacitating, making the activities of



daily life difficult or impossible.



<P>



A number of treatments are available to people who suffer from



anxiety disorders and insomnia. Physicians most widely recommend



either an anti-anxiety medication or behavioral therapy, or



both.



<P>



The most commonly prescribed drugs for anxiety disorders are



benzodiazepines. They are also used as muscle relaxants, to



treat insomnia, and to control severe epileptic seizures. They



are effective in treating some forms of depression, and anxiety



associated with depression and schizophrenia.



<P>



What are benzodiazepines?



<P>



Benzodiazepines are a class of medicines with a similar chemical



structure. There are a number of brand name medicines within the



benzodiazepine category(e.g. Ativan, Halcion, Restoril, Valium



and Zanies). Each of the brand products has slightly different



properties.



<P>



Benzodiazepines are relatively fast-acting drugs. Most begin to



take effect within hours, some in even less time. Dosage



generally starts at a low level and is gradually increased until



symptoms diminish. Dosage varies a great deal depending on



symptoms and an individual's body chemistry.



<P>



What do they do to the brain?



<P>



People with serious forms of anxiety demonstrate chronic



overactivity in the areas of the brain associated with fear or



nervousness. An inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma



aminobutyricacid (GABA) works in these areas to diminish this



excessive nerve cell activity.



<P>



There is evidence that benzodiazepines cause an increase in



the activity of GABA, thereby returning the system to a normal



level and reducing the associated symptoms of anxiety.They are



also believed to decrease the turnover rate of the



neurotransmitters, serotonin and norepinephrine.



<P>



Are they also useful in treating muscle spasms and epileptic



attacks?



<P>



Yes. And they've been successful in treating the toxic psychoses



caused by hallucinogenic drugs. They have many possible safe



medical uses.



<P>



Are they also effective in treating Insomnia?



<P>



Yes. However, sleeping problems are often a symptom of other



medical conditions. It is important that the cause of poor sleep



is diagnosed so that appropriate treatment can be given. Once



diagnosed and treated, sleep generally returns to normal.



<P>



Are benzodiazepines used effectively to treat major mental



illness?



<P>



Benzodiazepines may be useful, in low doses, for patients with



schizophrenia who are beginning to show signs of relapse, and may



help to avoid the necessity of major in creases in neuroleptic



medication. They may also be useful in treating mania.



<P>



What are common side effects of benzodiazepines?



<P>



Benzodiazepines generally have few side effects. Drowsiness and



loss of coordination are sometimes reported. Most common is



daytime fatigue that many people find subsides within a week or



two.



<P>



Other less frequent side effects include headache, loss of



concentration and memory problems, nervousness, depression,



dizziness, dry mouth and nausea.



<P>



Benzodiazepines are not recommended during the first three months



of pregnancy. If side effects are severe or persistent, see your



physician.



<P>



Is there a potential for dependence on these drugs? What about



addiction to benzodiazepines?



<P>



Dependence on benzodiazepines has been reported when they have



been used continuously for many months or years. This does not



mean that patients are "addicted" to their medication. 



<P>



Addiction is a pattern of drug abuse characterized by an



overwhelming preoccupation with the use of a drug, including



buildup of a physical tolerance to the drug's effects and intense



drug-seeking behavior.



<P>



Addiction to benzodiazepines is considered rare, except among



persons who have been addicted to other sub stances, such as



cocaine or alcohol.



<P>



Evidence indicates that the great majority of patients who use



benzodiazepines appropriately for long periods do not tend to



increase their doses, do not use medicines for recreational



purposes and do not be come dependent on them.



<P>



In some cases, patients requiring long-term benzodiazepine



therapy can become dependent on their medication to function



normally, in the same way a diabetic patient is dependent on



insulin to function normally.



<P>



What If the drug is abruptly stopped?



<P>



It is important to know that a sudden stop in taking the drug can



produce a seizure. Patients should discontinue the medicine



gradually, under a doctor's supervision.



<P>



When the dosage is tapered off gradually, the effects are



minimal. Discontinuation symptoms are frequently con fused with



rebound symptoms and relapse. Consult with the doctor before



discontinuing a benzodiazepine.



<P>



What are the symptoms of withdrawal?



<P>



Withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, shakiness, head ache,



dizziness, sleeplessness, loss of appetite, and in more severe



cases, fever, seizures, and psychosis. A withdrawal reaction may



be mistaken for a return of the anxiety, since many of the



symptoms are similar.

The Right Medication</H2>

<I>Note:  Dr. Schulz is a professor and the chairman of the Department

</I><P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Introduction</font>
<P>
	With the introduction of clozapine (Clozaril) in 1990 and then 
risperidone (Risperdal), launched in 1994, we entered a new era in 
the treatment of psychosis.  Olanzapine (Zyprexa), just approved in 
September 1996, and sertindole (Serlect), to be approved soon, add 
to the list of what are known as the "atypical" or "new" 
medications.  Research concerning all of these new medications 
indicates that they may treat a broader range of symptoms than the 
traditional antipsychotic medications and with fewer side effects. 
<P>
 	In all likelihood, there now will be a substantial flurry of 
information about new treatments for schizophrenia.  Clinicians, 
consumers, and families have awaited improved treatments, so there 
will be substantial excitement when these new interventions are all 
available.  
<P>
	We have listed, below, questions we believe are appropriate 
for consumers and their families to discuss with their doctor when 
making decisions about treatment with antipsychotic medication.  
These questions and answers are based on our clinical experience, 
participation in medication studies, and our literature review.  
Note that clinical practice has a legitimate variability, and the 
points made in our discussion are our opinions.  We recognize that 
many consumers are doing well on current standard treatment.  Also, 
the Q & A that follows presumes that consumers, family members, and 
physicians ought to be involved in open, candid, and clinically 
relevant discussions of diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">1.  Is the medicine effective?</font>
<P>
	All FDA-approved antipsychotic medications have been through 
rigorous testing and deemed effective, meaning that an 
antipsychotic medication reduces symptoms of psychosis 
statistically better than placebo.  Many of the new medications--
risperidone, olanzapine, and sertindole--have also been compared to 
traditional antipsychotic medications such as haloperidol (Haldol). 
 All three new medicines have shown themselves to be better than 
placebo and at least as good, if not better than, haloperidol.  It 
is appropriate to discuss efficacy with treating psychiatrists.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">2.  What range of symptoms do the antipsychotic medications treat?</font>
<P>
	Over the last four decades, psychiatrists have become 
accustomed to focusing on positive symptoms of psychosis such as 
hallucinations and delusions.  Early studies with the new 
medications indicate the possibility that negative symptoms may be 
improved, too.  Discussing this with your psychiatrist is very 
important.  In addition, the impact of the new medications on 
neuropsychological measures--the ability to maintain sustained 
attention, short-term memory, and decision-making--have been 
studied, so discuss these issues with your prescribing physician 
also.
<P>
	Broadly speaking, the atypical antipsychotic medicines treat a 
broader range of symptoms of schizophrenia than just hallucinations 
and delusions, or positive symptoms.  The atypicals also address 
negative symptoms such as social withdrawal.  A thoughtful 
discussion with your psychiatrist about which of the antipsychotic 
medications can best address your individual symptoms is important.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">3.  What is the risk of movement disorders with an antipsychotic 
medication?</font>
<P>
	Movement-disorder side effects are a frequent consequence of 
the typical or traditional antipsychotics, specifically dystonia 
(muscle spasm);  Parkinsonism (tremor, slow movements); and 
akathisia (restlessness).  Doctors minimize these effects by trying 
low doses of antipsychotics or using medicines to decrease movement 
symptoms.  The "atypical" antipsychotics got their name because 
they can decrease psychosis without causing movement disorders.  In 
our experience, risperidone has few side effects at low doses, but 
can lead to movement-disorder symptoms in higher doses.  Data from 
studies on sertindole and olanzapine indicate very low rates of 
movement side effects.  
<P>
	Epidemiologic studies show that traditional antipsychotic 
medications are associated with tardive dyskinesia (uncontrollable 
muscle spasms resulting in a twisting of the body or neck).  
Tardive dyskinesia (TD) will occur in four percent of patients each 
year that they are exposed to the traditional antipsychotics.  Put 
another way, after seven years of steady treatment with traditional 
antipsychotic medications, a person has a nearly 30 percent chance 
of developing TD.  Clozapine, the first atypical antipsychotic 
medication, does not lead to tardive dyskinesia.  Ripseridone, the 
first atypical antipsychotic medication for first-line use since 
1994, may be associated with tardive dyskinesia in less that one 
percent of patients per year.  The newest antipsychotic 
medications, olanzapine and sertindole, have probably not been 
tested long enough to make an estimate of their risk for TD; 
however, because they have low rates of Parkinsonism, we expect 
that the risk for tardive dyskinesia will be quite low.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">4.  What about other side effects and how long do they last?</font>
<P>
	Briefly, the traditional antipsychotic medications can lead to 
side effects of sedation, galactorrhea (stimulation of milk 
secretions in females), sexual dysfunction in males, and, rarely, 
liver disorder.  Because the traditional antipsychotic medications 
have movement-disorder side effects, psychiatrists frequently use 
anticholinergic medications such as benztropine (Cogentin) to treat 
them.  These medications may lead to dry mouth, constipation, and 
diminished memory skills.
<P>
	Most people are aware that clozapine is associated with a less 
than one percent chance of agranulocytosis (loss of production of 
white blood cells).  To prevent a serious outcome such as life-
threatening infection, assessment of the white blood count is 
performed weekly for consumers on clozapine.  Clozapine is also 
associated with seizures, sedation, drooling, and increased heart 
rate.  However, when a patient and physician decide that clozapine 
is appropriate for treatment-refractory schizophrenia or 
antipsychotic medication and tolerance, the benefits frequently 
outweigh the risks.
<P>
	After two and one-half years of availability--during which 
time about one million patients have been treated with it--
risperidone has proven to have few non-movement disorder side-
effects; however, it can cause gastric distress and mild sedation. 
<P>
 	The medications just approved or expected to be available in 
late 1996--olanzapine and sertindole--have few movement-disorder 
side effects; nevertheless, they may have non-movement-disorder 
side effects such as sexual dysfunction and minor EKG abnormalities 
with sertindole and possible mild liver dysfunction with 
olanzapine.  As these two medicines are quite new, doctors' 
experience with them is limited.  When a patient talks with a 
physician about the choice of these new medicines, discussing side 
effects is appropriate.  Many side effects, such as sedation, 
improve with time.  
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">5.  Do I have to take a combination of medicines, and do they 
interact?</font>
<P>
	Your psychiatrist may consider using other medications with an 
antipsychotic medication to treat psychiatric symptoms of 
schizophrenia.  For example, lorazepam (Ativan), an anti-anxiety 
agent, can be used for distress or agitation.  Because it is 
important to treat mood symptoms when they occur with psychosis, 
your psychiatrist may use antidepressants or mood-stabilizing 
agents with an antipsychotic medication.  It is appropriate for the 
consumer and his or her psychiatrist to discuss why an added 
medication is used and what side effects result from the 
combination.  For another example, when the anticonvulsant 
medicine, carbamazepine (Tegretol), is used with a traditional 
antipsychotic medication like haloperidol, the carbamazepine leads 
to increased metabolism of the haloperidol, and there can be 
reemergence of psychotic symptoms.  The new antidepressant 
medications, specifically serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI's), 
may diminish the metabolism of other medications and increase their 
blood levels.  Consumers and doctors certainly should review the 
effects of combinations of psychiatric medications.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">6.	What are the dosing and follow-up instructions?</font>
<P>
	Some antipsychotic medications are initially administered at 
the dose that proves most appropriate for a consumer.  As an 
example, haloperidol may be given at 10 mg. per day, and this may 
be the long-term dose for an individual consumer.  For other 
medications, an upward titration can frequently be employed.  In 
our opinion, starting at a somewhat lower dose of risperidone and 
titrating upward as needed has led to symptom reduction while 
diminishing side-effects.  Because of symptoms of hypotension (low 
blood pressure): tachycardia (rapid heart beat); and sedation, 
clozapine is administered in a slowly increasing dosing strategy.  
Consumers and psychiatrists need to communicate about these side-
effects so that titration can be performed appropriately.
<P>
	With new medications, pharmaceutical companies assess the 
results of clinical trials and suggest dosing strategies.  However, 
the initial strategy may change as many thousands of people are 
given a new medication in clinical practice.  For example, the 
dosing strategy for risperidone is generally different now than 
when it was first approved.  Most clinical researchers feel that 
there will be adjustments in dosing strategies with the newly 
released olanzapine and the soon-to-be-released sertindole.  This 
underscores the point that doctors and consumers as well as family 
members need to communicate clearly about dosing and follow-up 
instructions.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">7.	What should a family know?</font>
<P>
	The NAMI movement has stressed psycho-education as a major 
tenant.  Most psychiatrists working with consumers who have 
schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders think it is 
appropriate to openly discuss diagnosis, prognosis, and 
pharmacologic issues with these consumers and their family members. 
 In our opinion, when a consumer and a psychiatrist talk about the 
choice of an antipsychotic medication, family members should be 
included in the discussion so that they are informed about the 
issues described above and that everyone hears the same 
information.  Many clinics have printed medication information 
cards, and it is appropriate to ask your psychiatrist if any are 
available.  We also encourage participation in support groups 
designed for consumers and families so that experiences with 
medications can be shared.
<P>
	In summary, consumers, family members, and psychiatrists are 
excited about the potential for fundamentally new treatments for 
schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.  Although the new 
treatments are a step forward, their safe use does not occur in a 
vacuum.  Meaningful communication about what the medicines can do 
to diminish symptoms, what the side-effects are, and how the 
medicines should be used are crucial for best success.

<H2>Clinical Research on Schizophrenia</H2>
<A HREF="#shore"><H4>by David Shore, M.D.</H4></A>
 <HR>
Schizophrenia is the most chronic and disabling of the severe mental disorders.  People with schizophrenia often withdraw from the world and suffer terrifying psychotic symptoms--hearing voices or believing that other people are reading their minds, controlling their thinking, or plotting to harm them.  Speech and behavior may become so disorganized that the person's actions and communications become incomprehensible and sometimes frightening to others.  Even with available treatments, most people with schizophrenia continue to suffer chronically or episodically a large part of their lives.  For many such individuals, the illness' persisting consequences--lost opportunities, residual symptoms, stigma, and medication side effects--may be as troubling as the psychotic symptoms.  It is estimated that no more than one of every five people with schizophrenia completely recovers, while one in ten eventually commits suicide.
<P>
As NAMI members know, schizophrenia research has been a top priority of the National Institute of Mental Health for almost a decade now.  Rather than focusing on a summary of one research group's work, it may be most useful to highlight a number of scientific approaches being pursued around the world.  Most of these studies are NIMH grant-funded research, some are done by the institute's Intramural Research Program, and some with NAMI-affiliated foundation support, such as NARSAD and the Stanley Foundation.  Some of the studies described below were adapted from the recent NIMH Annual Report.

<P>
Research on the Causes of Schizophrenia
<P>
Schizophrenia has been the subject of considerable clinical research, yet in many ways it remains a medical mystery.  Perhaps the best clue we have about the underlying causes of schizophrenia is that it runs in certain families.  Twin and adoption studies have generally confirmed that genetic factors play a major role, and they may well produce the neurobiological vulnerability to schizophrenia.  An international team of researchers has recently confirmed earlier reports that the frequency of schizophrenia is higher among the biological relatives than among the adoptive relatives of adoptees with schizophrenia.  More specifically, the study found increased rates of chronic schizophrenia (and related schizophrenia-spectrum disorders) in the biological relatives of adoptees with chronic schizophrenia.  In fact, in this Danish national sample of adoptees with chronic schizophrenia, the disorder was found ten times more often in their biological relatives than in biological relatives of normal control adoptees.  This study supports the idea that familial clustering in schizophrenia is an expression of shared genetic factors.
<P>
Genetic studies of large families affected by this disorder have shown that is unlikely that a single gene accounts for a majority of cases of schizophrenia.  It is more likely that schizophrenia is caused by the interaction of several genes with environmental factors, perhaps those influencing brain development and function.  While earlier reports of chromosome 5 linkage for genes associated with schizophrenia have turned out to be inaccurate, more recently there have been several exciting leads.  A number of research groups have been studying specific markers on chromosome 6, and several are confirming linkage results in the same region of that chromosome.  Thus, we may soon be able to focus research on well-documented "schizophrenia vulnerability genes."  In addition to the chromosome 6 results, there are also several reports of "hot spots" for potential linkage on other chromosomes.  During the remaining years of this Decade of the Brain, we can expect many exciting discoveries about schizophrenia's complex genetic mechanisms.
<P>
While some scientists investigate the role of genetic factors in causing schizophrenia, others are searching for a mechanism that would explain why most people with this disorder do not first show psychotic symptoms until they reach their teen or twenties.  Several have reviewed the literature on neurobiological abnormalities found in schizophrenia and concluded that abnormal pruning of neurons (the elimination of extra neurons) during adolescence may occur in susceptible individuals and that these abnormalities might then interact with other factors to produce the symptoms of schizophrenia.
<P>
New neuropathological, obstetrical, and epidemiological evidence suggests that prenatal factors (e.g., flu during pregnancy) may play a role in some cases of adult-onset schizophrenia.  E. Fuller Torrey, M.D., and a group of NIMH scientists evaluated data on 23 identical twin pairs in which only one twin had schizophrenia to determine at what age they markedly and permanently began diverging from each other in motor skills or unusual behavior.  Seven of the twins who later developed schizophrenia had become permanently different from their co-twins by age five.  The other 16 twins differentiated from their co-twins between the ages of 13 and 27.  The early-divergence group differed from the others on minor physical anomalies and total finger ridge counts, both of which are believed to be determined by the end of the second trimester of fetal development.  As a result, the researchers concluded that some cases of adult-onset schizophrenia are associated with early prenatal events, which may include neurodevelopmental abnormalities and/or infections.
<P>
One of the aims of longitudinal research in schizophrenia has been to discover early indicators of adult psychopathology.  Towards this end, NIMH-Israeli High Risk Study scientists followed a group of 50 children at genetic risk for schizophrenia (having a parent with the disorder), and 50 matched controls for 25 years.  The children at risk were more likely to develop schizophrenia (as well as mood and personality disorders) than were age-matched control subjects.  This study also found that the information-processing abilities of adult children of subjects with schizophrenia fall in between those of patients with schizophrenia and those of controls and that measures of sustained attention and ability to focus provided the best discrimination between groups.  Further analysis showed that among those genetically "at risk," poor childhood scores on tests of mental focusing were associated with the development of schizophrenia and related disorders in adulthood.
<P>

Research on Treatments
<P>
Clinical experience during the past 30 years has shown that the first-generation, "typical" antipsychotic medications, such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol, control many of the psychotic (or "positive") symptoms in most people with schizophrenia.  Unfortunately, the "negative" symptoms--such as emotional withdrawal and decreased motivation, communication, and social skills--are generally far less responsive to these drugs.  This Decade of the Brain has brought us to the threshold of some really dramatic changes in medications available for people with schizophrenia.  Typical antipsychotic agents now in use may before long be drugs of the past, thanks to a group of "atypical" (or second-generation) medications.
<P>
Clozapine, the first of these "atypical" antipsychotics, appears to affect both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia without the neurological (extrapyramidal) side effects associated with older drugs.  Clozapine can, however, produce a life-threatening side effect (called agranulocytosis) in about one percent of patients.  A newer antipsychotic called risperidone was introduced in 1994, and several experimental medications (such as olanzapine, seroquel, sertindole, and ziprasidone) are now in clinical trials and may be available in the U.S. within a year or two.  The atypical antipsychotic drugs offer the possibility of better control of both positive and negative symptoms with fewer extrapyramidal side effects and probably a lower risk for later development of tardive dyskinesia.  (Tardive dyskinesia is a neurological disorder characterized by persistent, abnormal, involuntary movements, typically of the mouth or face.  Extrapyramidal symptoms resemble those associated with Parkinson's disease.)  Newer drugs have not been found to cause agranulocytosis.
<P>
Research continues, meanwhile, on pinpointing those parts of the brain that respond to antipsychotic agents.  Researchers have long assumed that the therapeutic effects of antipsychotic medications result from their binding to the D2 class of dopamine receptors in the brain.  However, research on clozapine found little evidence that this drug was tightly bound to D2 sites in parts of the brain, and some have suggested that effects on serotonin may be important for antipsychotic effects of the atypical medications.  NIMH-funded researchers in Sweden have used positron emission tomography (PET) scans, a neuroimaging technique, to examine the connection between the ability of a drug to bind to D2 receptors and its antipsychotic and extrapyramidal effects.  They have found that extrapyramidal side effects were associated with higher D2 binding.  This study suggests that efforts to develop antipsychotic drugs that have relatively low affinity for the D2 receptor may produce new medications with fewer side effects.
<P>
Conclusions
<P>
Research on the neurobiology of schizophrenia has accelerated, and the results of the studies may soon lead to improved treatments and new avenues for research on the origins of this disorder.  A growing body of evidence from neurochemical and developmental studies suggests that some types of schizophrenia may result from prenatal pathological processes and genetic abnormalities that affect the brain.  It is also becoming clearer that, while the neurotransmitter dopamine plays a role in the expression of the symptoms in persons with schizophrenia, other neurotransmitter systems are likely to be involved.  These findings are now playing a key role in the testing of new medications that should prove better at reducing both positive and negative symptoms, while causing fewer troublesome side effects.

<H2>Research On Severe Mental Illness</H2>
By Carol Rees, Former NAMI Board Member
<HR>
	"Research on brain disease is the most exciting field that 
exists," according to researcher and NAMI board member Jill Bolte 
Taylor, Ph.D., in introducing plenary speakers Joseph Coyle, 
M.D., of Harvard Medical School; John Kane, M.D. of Hillside 
Hospital and Albert Einstein College of Medicine; and David 
Shern, Ph.D., director of the Bureau of Evaluation and Services 
Research, New York Office of Mental Health.  On Research Day at 
the NAMI convention, these researchers spoke of promising new 
discoveries, but also about the problems of stigma, uncertainties 
in healthcare financing, and mental health systems that fail to 
put into practice services that we already know will work.
<P>
	Dr. Coyle reviewed recent research on severe mental illness, 
stating that the function and structure of neuroanatomy in 
schizophrenia is now known.  According to Dr. Coyle, these 
advances in research were made possible because of the 
involvement of scientists who are able to build on foundations 
laid by basic neuroscience research and the new powerful 
technologies such as mapping of gene expression in the brain and 
mapping of brain function.  Researchers at NIMH have accomplished 
the steady erosion of the mind-brain dichotomy, bringing 
clinicians, behavioral neuroscientists, and molecular 
neuroscience together to solve the most elusive problems in 
medicine:  psychiatric disorders.
<P>
	Dr. Coyle observed that "While the NIMH suffers from all the 
problems of a Washington-based bureaucracy, it has accomplished 
amazing science.  I think it is now the time to stand by it."  He 
added that the ridicule of scientologists should be recognized 
for what it is--an attempt to stop research on the biological 
basis of psychiatric disorder.
<P>
	According to Dr. Kane, we are at a very exciting time in 
research in mental illness.  "There have been substantial 
achievements, and there is the likelihood that we can expect even 
greater achievements in the not-too-distant future.  At the same 
time, there are threats to our ability both to conduct research 
and to support the kind of integration that is necessary between 
research in mental illness and research in other areas of 
medicine."
<P>
	Dr. Kane pointed to exciting developments in genetic linkage 
studies and to the development of the first new drugs for the 
treatment of schizophrenia in 15 years.  Advances are being made 
in understanding abnormal brain function in disorders such as 
schizophrenia, depression, Alzheimer's disease, and panic 
disorder.  A tremendous amount of work has been done in relapse 
prevention in schizophrenia, and scientists are trying to better 
understand the strategies that are effective in preventing 
relapse and rehospitalization.
<P>
	Dr. Shern warned that changes being made by Congress are 
"shifting responsibility for the most vulnerable populations--
which includes persons with severe mental disorders--from federal 
responsibility for provision of services through Medicaid and 
other federal programs to states.  At the same time, states are 
changing their responsibilities, and medicine is becoming 
corporatized, privatized."
<P>
	"NAMI has made an enormous difference," said Dr. Shern.  
"[You have made an] enormous difference locally and nationally in 
focusing on the issues of persons with severe mental disorders 
and making systems become responsive to the needs of consumers 
and families."
<P>

<H4>Depakote Approved For Manic Episodes Of Bipolar Disorder</H4>

Depakote (divalproex sodium, a derivative of valproic acid) 
tablets--long a popular seizure medication--have been appproved 
by the FDA for the treatment of manic episodes of bipolar 
disorder.  Marketed by Abbott Laboratories, it is the first 
medication indicated for manic episodes associated with bipolar 
disorder in 25 years.  Significant improvement of manic symptoms 
was found in two, 21-day placebo-controlled clinical trials, and 
the rate of discontinuation in these trials was not statistically 
different between placebo, Depakote, or the active control.  
Depakote, which can begin alleviating symptoms in 10 days and has 
few side effects, offers an alternative to lithium, which has 
numerous side effects and can take weeks to work.  With FDA 
approval, insurance companies will cover it and more doctors will 
prescribe it.  Further information is available to physicians 
only at 708/937-2667.
<P>

<H4>Depakote Found Effective For Adolescents With Mania</H4>

Studying 15 patients over two years, George Papatheodorou and 
associates of Toronto's Sunnybrook Health Science Center found 
that valproic acid (Depakote) may be effective for treating mania 
in adolescents.  The 13 females and two males, 15- to 20-years-
old, had diagnoses of bipolar disorder, manic subtype, and were 
treated for seven weeks with Depakote, which was coadministered 
with other medications.  Among the 13 patients completing the 
study, eight showed "marked" improvement, four showed "moderate" 
improvement, and one showed "some" improvement.  Depakote was 
well tolerated by these 13 patients, who reported that somatic 
symptoms lessened by the end of treatment.  The researchers 
believe their work holds "initial evidence for the efficacy and 
tolerability of divalproex sodium in the acute treatment of 
adolescent mania."  ("The Efficacy and Safety of Divalproex 
Sodium in the treatment of Acute Mania in Adolescents and Young 
Adults:  An Open Clinical Trial," G. Papatheodorou, et al, 
Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology 155:2, 1995.)
<P>
<H4>Lithium May Help Some Children With Aggression
</H4>
	The psychoactive drug lithium appears to be effective in 
treating children with aggressive-type conduct disorder severe 
enough to require psychiatric hospitalization, suggests a study 
in the April 1995 issue of the Journal of the American Academy of 
Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.  Lithium may be particularly 
helpful treating children with the affective or hostile subtype 
of aggression who have characteristic anger, irritability or 
rage, not necessarily provoked by any specific event.  In 
contrast, a "predatory" type of aggression is often brought on by 
specific stimuli.  The neurochemical basis of the two subtypes 
may be different, and the evidence suggests that the affective 
type may respond to lithium.
<P>
	In a double-blind study, 50 children diagnosed as having 
conduct disorder with affective subtype aggression were treated 
for six weeks using either lithium or placebo.  Each child's 
condition previously failed to respond to the usual treatments 
and was so severe that admission to a psychiatric hospital was 
required.  Following treatment, 68 percent of the children 
treated with lithium showed at least moderate improvement, 
compared with 40 percent of those receiving the placebo.  Forty 
percent of the lithium-treated children displayed marked 
improvement, compared to only 4 percent of the placebo-treated 
patients.
<P>

Adolescent Psychiatry, 202/966-7300.</I>
<P>
<H4>Antidepressant As Good As Ritalin For ADHD Kids</H4>
<P>
	The antidepressant bupropion appears to be as effective as 
Ritalin in treating children with attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD), according to a study published in the May issue 
of the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent 
Psychiatry.  Fifteen children between the ages of seven and 
seventeen were studied throughout drug treatment and a two-week 
"wash out' period during which they received no drug treatment.  
Both bupropion and Ritalin significantly improved attention and 
conduct in these children, as judged by their parents, teachers, 
and physicians.
<P>
	Both drugs produced similar improvements on a wide range of 
behavioral and psychiatric tests.  Where there were differences, 
Ritalin tended to be more effective, though differences were 
slight and considered insignificant.  There were few side effects 
with either drug.  Study findings suggest that bupropion is a 
useful alternative for those who either do not respond to Ritalin 
or who cannot take it due to allergy or side effects.  For 
further information, call the American Academy of Child and 
Adolescent Psychiatry, 202-966-7300.

<P>

<H4>Clozapine As A Mood Stabilizer?</H4>

Researchers Carlos Zarate, Jr., and associates studied a group of 
patients (nine men and eight women with a mean age of 39 years) 
with diagnoses of "bipolar disorder (manic or mixed)" or 
"schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type" who had been discharged 
from McLean Hospital while taking clozapine alone.  Eleven of 17 
patients (65 percent) had been rated (by raters blind to 
diagnosis and baseline data) "much" or "very much" improved 
(according to the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement Scale) 
at the time of hospital discharge, when the patients' mean 
clozapine dosage was 182 mg/day).  Further, the researchers 
performed a variety of outcome measures by face-to-face or 
telephone interviews eight to 24 months after discharge and found 
that 15 of 17 (88 percent) were rated as much or very much 
improved on the CGI-I.  This occurred when the patients' mean 
clozapine dosage was 304 mg/day (and six of 17 had been started 
on adjunctive medication).  This follow-up also  found that 65 
percent of the patients had no "hospitalizations, affective 
episodes, or need of concomitant medications."  Although their 
study was retrospective, incompletely blind, and uncontrolled, 
the researchers believe that some patients with severe, 
treatment-refractory bipolar or schizoaffective disorder may 
respond to clozapine acutely and derive significant mood 
stabilization over the long term.  ("Is Clozapine a Mood 
Stabilizer?" C.A. Zarate, Jr., et al, Journal of Clinical 
Psychiatry 56:3, 1995.)

<H4>Promising, Unique Antidepressant Has Fewer Side Effects
</H4>
Recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, Serzone 
(nefazodone HCI) is the first of a new class of dual-action 
antidepressants to produce the effects of both serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclics.  According to Jan Fawcett, 
M.D., professor and chair of Rush-Presbyterian-St Luke's Medical 
Center in Chicago, Serzone increases brain levels of serotonin 
(mood regulators) as the SSRI drugs do, and it blocks serotonin 
receptors like the tricyclics, specifically 5HT2, one of the most 
important depression receptors.  Although no head-to-head 
comparisons have been done, Serzone's manufacturer, Bristol-Myers 
Squibb Company, claims that Serzone combines the optimum benefits 
of SSRIs like Prozac with an additional boost, fewer side-effects 
such as anxiety, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction.  It also costs 
10 percent to 20 percent less than other antidepressants.  
Clinical trials indicate that Serzone is as effective at 
alleviating depression as other drugs.

<H4>What You Should Know Before Participating In A Research Program</H4>

by Vera Hassner Sharav, quality of treatment chair, AMI-NYS
<P>
	Until safeguards for psychiatric patients in experimental 
research are improved and full disclosure requirements are 
universally implemented, we suggest that the following questions 
be asked by potential subjects of research, their families, or 
significant others, prior to signing consent forms.
<P>
1.  Is there an independent monitor (who is not connected with 
the research team) assigned to ensure that patient safeguards are 
followed?  What authority does that individual have?  How will 
this person ensure the patient-subject's continued consent?
<P>
2.  Who is authorized and available during off hours (i.e., 
weekends, evenings, holidays) for patients to contact in the 
event they wish to withdraw from a protocol.
<P>
3.  During participation in a research protocol, what services 
and activities are available to the patient?  Are these services 
part of the institution's normal rehabilitation and treatment 
program or are they available only to research subjects?
<P>
4.  Are drug wash-outs required?  For how long?  Is it a placebo-
control study? 
<P>
5.  If symptoms return and I am uncomfortable, will I be given 
medications immediately?  Who is authorized to prescribe 
therapeutic medications upon my (or my family's) request?
<P>
6.  Are non-FDA approved, investigation medications given in this 
protocol?  Is this study being funded by the pharmaceutical 
company?  If yes, ask to meet with a member of the Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) to discuss the known and potential risks 
involved.
<P>
7.  If non-investigation drugs are involved, are these drugs 
approved (by the FDA) for my condition?  Ask for a photocopy of 
the Physicians Desk Reference (PDR) reference discussing the 
risks and side effects of this medication and ask whether you 
will be given the standard recommended dose.
<P>
8.  If the drugs used in the study prove to be beneficial to me, 
am I assured that I will continue to be treated with the 
medication after completing the study?
<P>
9.  Are there procedures that involve radiation in this study?  
If yes, ask to speak to the chairman of the IRB to discuss the 
limitations of risks.
<P>
10.  Will this experiment involve any procedures that are painful 
or uncomfortable (e.g., injections or I-V studies, spinal taps, 
long periods of immobilization, sleep deprivation, dietary 
restrictions, bed/unit restrictions)?
<P>
11.  Does the consent form cover more than one study?  Is this an 
"umbrella" consent that will allow several procedures to be 
performed concomitantly or successively?
<P>
12.  If there are any therapeutic benefits learned from the 
protocol, will I and my family be informed of this in writing?  
Will my patient record indicate these beneficial findings for the 
purpose of follow-up care?
<P>
13.  What follow-up care is offered to patients who complete a 
study?  To those who drop out?

<H2>Bipolar Disorder And Multiple Relapses</H2>
 <HR>

	Patients with bipolar disorder have a high risk of relapsing even with aggressive treatment.  In The American Journal of Psychiatry (November 1995), Gitlin et al. reported a study of 82 outpatients with bipolar disorder for an average of more than four years.  There was a 73 percent probability that over five years a patient with bipolar disorder would relapse into an episode of mania or depression, and very likely more than once.  Even subjects who did not relapse reported a considerable amount of depressive symptoms.  Poor psychosocial functioning, particularly unemployment, accompanied poor syndromal course and predicted a shorter time to relapse.

<H2>The Efficacy Of Schizophrenia Treatment</H2>
 <HR>

	The Efficacy of Schizophrenia Treatment, published by NAMI in November 1995, documents the effectiveness of existing schizophrenia treatments.  Co-authors Laura Lee Hall, Ph.D., director of research at NAMI, and Tami L. Mark, Ph.D., a senior research director at Project Hope examine data from the most rigorous reviews of randomized controlled trials of schizophrenia treatment.  The data show that medications and psychosocial interventions--such as skills training, intensive case management, and supported employment--reduce symptoms, relapse, and hospitalization and improve functioning, quality of life, employment status, and satisfaction.
<P>	"People with schizophrenia and their family members can find hope in these data," said Dr. Hall.  "Treatments that work for many individuals with this severe brain disorder do exist.  These data showing the effectiveness of schizophrenia treatments and supports provide an overwhelming rationale for the end of insurance discrimination based on the false notion that there is no effective treatment for schizophrenia.  Furthermore, effectiveness data should increase access to treatment by informing the delivery and financing of care for people with schizophrenia.  For example, these data can serve as the scientific foundation for managed care organizations to match effective and necessary treatment to those who need it."
<P>	The Efficacy of Schizophrenia Treatment is available from NAMI's Resource Distribution and Sales (RDS) department for $5.00.  Ask for publication #R325.

<H2>Special Education and the Child With a Neurobiological Disorder</H2>
 <HR>
Most of my child's problems occur at school.  How can I help my child to get the education he or she needs?
<P>
Learn about the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Your local librarian can help you locate this information, or you can contact the National Information Center for Children and Youth with Disabilities, P.O. Box 1492, Washington, DC 20013-1492. Tel: (202) 416-0300.  
<P>
You can also learn about IDEA from other parents through organizations such as the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill.  Call the NAMI Helpline at 1-800-950-6264 to find the telephone number of your local affiliate.
<P>
What are the provisions of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)?
<P>
IDEA mandates that all children with disabilities, including those with serious emotional disturbances, must receive a free and appropriate public education in the least restrictive setting.  
<P>
The key is to get services for your child at the lowest intensity of service that will meet your child's needs.  Often this means bringing new services into schools that have never provided those services.  The fact that the school system "never did it that way before" is no excuse.  The school system is required to provide supplementary aids and services to your child to help him or her be educated in the least restrictive setting possible.  Such aids and services may include (but are not limited to) a classroom or one-to-one aide, curriculum modifications, peer tutoring, untimed tests, or the provision of a tape recorder, computer, or typewriter.
<P>
Your child's Individualized Education Plan (IEP) is the plan for his or her special education.  You, as parent or guardian, have the right to attend meetings to develop the IEP that specifies exactly what your child must be taught, where and how he or she must be taught and what kind of accommodations and related services are needed to give him or her the most appropriate education.  
<P>
Teaching strategies and behavior-management strategies developed for children with serious emotional disorders are sometimes used inappropriately for children with NBD.  You and the child's psychiatrist should work with the school system to develop an IEP tailored to your child's needs.
<P>
Is therapy available in schools?
<P>
IDEA is responsible for meeting only the educational needs of your child.  Related services are those services that must be provided to your child so that he or she can benefit from special education instruction.  Therapy is one such related service that your child may need to benefit from his or her special education.  If your child needs related services, these services must be part of your child's IEP.  
<P>
Some school districts are collaborating with their local mental health administration, and now offer some forms of therapy through the schools.  However, psychiatrists are very often not part of this team.
<P>
My child has been placed on home instruction.  How long can the schools system keep him at home?
<P>
If your child is receiving home teaching, the home teaching can be provided for no more than 60 school days while the school system looks for an appropriate special education program, unless your child's IEP allows for an extension beyond 60 days.
<P>
What happens if a public placement cannot be found?
<P>
The school system must place your child in an appropriate program.  If the school system cannot provide an appropriate public program, the school system must place your child in a non-public (private) school and pay for it.  The school system must pay all the costs of the placement.  This includes transportation.
<P>
My child is an adolescent with a severe neurobiological disorder.  What services are available to my son or daughter as he or she reaches adulthood?
<P>
If your child is "coded," or identified with a disability such as SED under the IDEA, he or she is eligible for educational services until age 21--in most States.  In addition, IDEA specifically states that transition goals should be part of a students IEP, in some children as young as 14.  Nationwide there is a drop out rate of over 50% for children coded SED.  If you believe your child is in risk of dropping out, insist that transition planning begin as early as possible.
<P>
Transition goals and objectives will lead to the development of marketable job skills and independent living skills.  Find out what opportunities exist in your community for persons with NBD to receive psychiatric rehabilitation services.  Contact a local representative of your state's vocational rehabilitation program office (part of State Department of Education).  Find out about the application process and what information they require to determine eligibility for your son or daughter.  Usually they fund a variety of services and some may meet your child's needs as he or she becomes an adult.  In addition, investigate appropriate post-secondary educational opportunities and housing options in your community.  Make sure that your child is linked with adult services.
<P>
If your child has dropped out, investigate the possibility of his earning a GED certificate.  The adult education program of your local public schools may provide evening or weekend preparation classes for individuals over the age of 16.

<H2>MRI Can Diagnose OCD</H2>
<HR>
	The Neuroimagining Research Laboratory at the New England Medical Center, Boston, researches the 
physiological aspects of obsessive-compulsive disorder, which is characterized by the inability to stop repetitive, intrusive 
thoughts and/or actions.  This laboratory is using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single photon emission 
computed tomography (SPECT) scans to show that individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder have increased 
metabolic activity and blood flow to part of their brains.  
<p>
	"Our study shows that the obsessive-compulsive group had a 125 percent increase in the brain's frontal blood 
flow," says Gordon Harris, Ph.D., director of the neuroimaging lab.  "For the first time, patients can see that there is a 
physical explanation for their disorder and that it's not purely psychological as was once believed.
<p>
	The test may also show how well medicines and therapy can alter the change in blood flow to the brain.

<H2>Bipolar Risk</H2>
<HR>	


	According to an article in the fall 1995 NARSAD Research 
Newsletter ("Advances in Genetics of Psychiatric Disorders" by Anne 
Brown), "For bipolar disorder, if an individual has one affected 
parent, the risk of developing the disorder is 27%, and if both 
parents are affected, the risk increases to 74%.  For 
schizophrenia, the corresponding risks are 9% and 46%."

<H2>Trials Find Olanzapine Treats Schizophrenia</H2></center>

 <HR>


	Data gathered during a double-blind, randomized study involving 1,996 patients and 174 investigators in 17 countries suggest that olanzapine--Eli Lilly and Company's investigational antipsychotic--may treat both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.  (Positive symptoms include delusions and hallucinations, and negative symptoms include diminished emotions and low motivation.)  Many currently available, older antipsychotic medications are perceived as having little or no effect on negative symptoms.
<P>
	Study subjects were randomly selected to receive either olanzapine or haloperidol, the antipsychotic drug most often globally prescribed for the treatment of schizophrenia.  Patients treated with olanzapine showed statistically significant improvements in overall symptoms, improvements in negative symptoms, and improvements in drug-induced side-effects such as Parkinson's disease-like symptoms (rigidity, tremors), akathisia (an inability to sit still), and dyskinetic involuntary muscle movements (tardive dyskinesia).  The most common side effects associated with olanzapine were insomnia, dry mouth, akathisia, and nervousness.  There were no reported cases of agranulocytosis, a sometimes fatal blood disorder that has been reported in 1 to 2 percent of patients who take clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic used as a treatment for schizophrenia.
<P>
	Eli Lilly and Company is seeking worldwide approval to market olanzapine for the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.

<A NAME = "thing"><H2>12 THINGS TO DO IF YOUR LOVED . . .</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>

<P>
Twelve Things To Do If Your Loved One Is Addicted To Drugs And/Or
Alcohol:
<P>
1.  Don't regard this as a family disgrace.  Recovery from an
addiction can come about just as with other illnesses.
<P>
2.  Don't nag, preach or lecture to the addict/alcoholic. 
Chances are he/she has already told him or herself everything you
can tell them.  He/she will take just so much and shut out the
rest.  You may only increase their need to lie or force one to
make promises that cannot possibly be kept.
<P>
3.  Guard against the "holier-than-thou" or martyr-like attitude.
It is possible to create this impression without saying a word.
An addict's sensitivity is such that he/she judges other people's
attitudes toward him/her more by small things than spoken words.
<P>
4.  Don't use the "if you loved me" appeal.  Since the
addict/alcoholic is compulsive and cannot be controlled by
willpower, this approach only increases guilt.  It is like
saying, "If you loved me, you would not have tuberculosis."
<P>
5.  Avoid any threats unless you think it through carefully and
definitely intend to carry them out.  There may be times, of
course, when a specific action is necessary to protect children. 
Idle threats only make the addict/alcoholic feel you don't mean
what you say.
<P>
6.  Don't hide the drugs/alcohol or dispose of them/it.  Usually
this only pushes the addict/alcoholic into a state of
desperation.  In the end he/she will simply find news ways of
getting more drugs/liquor.
<P>
7.  Don't let the addict/alcoholic persuade you to use drugs or
drink with him/her on the grounds that it will make him/her use
less.  It rarely does.  Besides, when you condone the
using/drinking, he/she puts off doing something to get help.
<P>
8.  Don't be jealous of the method of recovery the
addict/alcoholic chooses.  The tendency is to think that love of
home and family is enough incentive for seeking recovery.
<P>
Frequently the motivation of regaining self respect is more
compelling for the addict/alcoholic than resumption of family
responsibilities. You may feel left out when the addict/alcoholic
turns to other people for helping stay sober. You wouldn't be
jealous of the doctor of someone needing medical care, would you?
<P>
9.  Don't expect an immediate 100 percent recovery.  In any
illness, there is a period of convalescence.  There may be
relapses and times of tension and resentment.
<P>
10. Don't try to protect the recovering person from
using/drinking situations.  It's one of the quickest ways to push
one into relapse.
<P>
They must learn on their own to say "no" gracefully.  If you warn
people against serving him/her drinks, you will stir up old
feelings of resentment and inadequacy.
<P>
11. Don't do for the addict/alcoholic that which he/she can do
for him/herself.  You cannot take the medicine for him/her. 
Don't remove the problem before the addict/alcoholic can face it,
solve it or suffer the consequences.
<P>
12. Do offer love, support and understanding in the recovery.
<P>


<A NAME = "atten"><H2>ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY . . .</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
<P>
What Is Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)?
<P>
ADHD is the most commonly diagnosed behavior disorder in
children.
<P>
The core symptoms are inattention, impulsivity, and
hyperactivity. Children with ADHD are restless and fidgety,
interrupt conversations, call out in class, and have difficulty
completing school assignments. They often do not have appropriate
social skills for their age group.
<P>
Although ADHD is usually diagnosed in childhood, it can persist
into adolescence and adulthood. As individuals with ADHD grow
older, they are vulnerable to antisocial behavior, impulsiveness,
and educational failure.
<P>
What are the symptoms of ADHD?
<P>
A child who has ADHD shows several of the following
characteristics:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>-- has difficulty organizing work and gives the impression he or she has not heard instructions.
<LI>-- is easily distracted.
<LI>-- makes careless, impulsive errors.
<LI>-- frequently calls out in class.
<LI>-- has difficulty awaiting his/her turn in groups.
<LI>-- fails to follow through on parents' requests.
<LI>-- is unable to play games for the same amount of time as other
<LI>children of the same age.
<LI>-- feels socially isolated from peers.
</UL>

<P>
Is ADHD associated with other neurological, biological, and
behavioral disorders?
<P>
Yes. ADHD is closely associated with:
<P>
1. At least 25 percent of children with ADHD suffer from some
type of communication/learning disability.
<P>
2. Approximately 40 percent of children with ADHD exhibit signs
of Conduct Disorder (starting fights, lying, stealing) or
Oppositional Defiant Disorder (disobedience, defiance, and rule
breaking).
<P>
3. There is a strong correlation between the neurobiological
disorder called Tourette's Syndrome and ADHD. At least half of
patients with Tourette's also have ADHD, (but the opposite is not
true: half of ADHD patients do not have Tourette's).
<P>
What causes ADHD?
<P>
We don't fully know yet, but it clearly has biological
underpinnings. Many people -- including some medical
professionals, teachers, parents, and peers -- do not understand
these biological under pinnings.
<P>
They often mislabel children with ADHD as undisciplined, stupid,
lazy, or simply bad. In fact, strong scientific evidence supports
the conclusion that persons with ADHD suffer from a brain-based
biological disorder.
<P>
Examples:
<P>
1. Biochemical studies have documented that children with ADHD
have lower levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine.
<P>
2. Laboratory animal models relevant to ADHD reveal deficiencies
in a number of neurotransmitters, including dopamine.
<P>
3. Successful medications for ADHD affect the levels of several
neurotransmitters in the brain.
<P>
4. Brain imaging studies using PET scanners have shown that brain
metabolism is lower in patients with ADHD than in normal
controls. More important, these studies show significantly lower
metabolic activity in regions of the brain that control
attention, social judgment, and movement.
<P>
5. There is strong evidence that ADHD has a genetic basis in some
cases.
<P>
6. Environmental factors associated with ADHD include low birth
weight, hypoxia (too little oxygen) at birth, and exposure in
utero to a number of toxins including alcohol, cocaine, and
nicotine.
<P>
Although the possible relationship between ADHD and dietary
factors and food additives has been widely discussed, scientific
studies have not verified dietary factors as a main cause of
ADHD.
<P>
What treatment is available for ADHD?
<P>
A comprehensive approach is the key to successful treatment for
individuals with ADHD. Parents should derive hope from the fact
that the vast majority of patients with ADHD benefit from
treatment.
<P>
Medication is successful in more than 67 percent of all ADHD
individuals, but is best managed by a specialist in this area,
such as a child psychiatrist.
<P>
Successful medications include stimulants such as
methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, and pemoline, plus
antidepressants such as imipramine.
<P>
Proper medication therapy improves attention span, controls
impulses, dampens restlessness, improves school performance,
decreases aggression, and enhances the quality of family life.
<P>
Formal educational testing and an evaluation for speech and
language disorders should be performed. Where appropriate,
parents should work with the school district to plan an
individualized education program (IEP) for their child. 
<P>
Behavioral modification strategies and special programs
addressing the cognitive deficits in children with ADHD may be
useful. Children can be offered specific incentives and rewards
for changing behavior, and specific games and exercises to
address cognitive deficits.
<P>
Children with ADHD are particularly in need of support and
encouragement. Since academics are frequently difficult for them,
they must often find other avenues to build self-esteem, such as
through sports, art, music or other special interests.
<P>
There is little evidence that psychodynamic psychotherapy alone
is effective in children with ADHD who suffer from a true
biological disorder, but there is scientific evidence for the
efficacy of several cognitive and behavioral therapies.
<P>
What can I do if a family member has ADHD?
<P>
First, cooperation and collaboration among an experienced
clinician, the school system, and the family are the keys to
developing a comprehensive, successful treatment strategy for a
child with ADHD.
<P>
Seek the advice of your child's pediatrician, school personnel,
knowledgeable friends, and national organizations such as
NAMI-CAN for a referral to a clinician who specializes in the
pharmacologic treatment of ADHD.
<P>
Educate yourself about special education programs in your state.
A new federal law, the Individuals with Disabilities Education
Act (Public Law 101 476) mandates that all disabled children are
entitled to "a free appropriate public education which emphasizes
special education and related services designed to meet their
unique needs."
<P>
Work with your local school district to plan a special education
program for your child.
<P>
Glossary of Terms
<P>
Conduct Disorder: Children with this disorder persistently
disregard rules and violate other's rights.
<P>
The most common behaviors are stealing, running away, lying, fire
setting, truancy from school or work, breaking into cars or
buildings, deliberate destruction of property, cruelty to animals
or people, fighting, and stealing with confrontation.
<P>
Dopamine: An important neurotransmitter in the brain. Abnormal
dopamine function has been implicated in a variety of
neurobiological disorders including ADHD, Tourette's Syndrome,
schizophrenia, and autism.
<P>
Neurotransmitter: Chemicals released from a neuron (nerve cell)
in the brain to communicate with other neurons. This chemical
transfer of information takes place in a structure called the
synapse, where parts of the neurons lie very close to one
another.
<P>
Tourette's Syndrome: An uncommon familial neurological disorder
characterized by waxing and waning motor and phonic tics plus
complex behavioral symptoms. It is likely that Tourette's is
related to abnormal functioning of several neurotransmitters in
specific parts of the brain.

<P>
Almost one-third of six-to-twelve-year-old children diagnosed with major depression will develop bipolar disorders within a few years, according to a study of 79 depressed children over two-to-five years reported in the May 1994 issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.  Most became bipolar before the onset of puberty, and 32% became bipolar at an average age of 11 years. 
<P>
The researchers recommend that those caring for depressed children should be on the lookout for symptoms of manic-depressive illness.  They also suggested that--because antidepressants may worsen certain forms of manic illness in adults--prescribing antidepressants for children should be done with care.

<P>

<A NAME = "depre"><H2>DEPRESSION AND THE ELDERLY</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
Oregon psychiatrists fear that severe depression can lead some elderly patients to make deadly, inappropriate decisions about continuation of medical treatment, according to a survey by researchers at the Portland Veterans Administration Medical Center reported in the November 1994 American Journal of Psychiatry. 
<P>
More than 75 percent of Americans favor legislation allowing terminally ill patients or their family members to withdraw life-sustaining treatments, but the researchers argue that severe depression may influence patients to reject medical care they might otherwise accept if their depression were treated.  "Hopelessness leads to undervaluing all possible good outcomes for a medical treatment," said Linda Ganzini, M.D., and colleagues.  "
<P>
This study supports the hypothesis that in many depressed persons, hopelessness, pessimism and excessive emphasis on the burdens of treatment temporarily alter the person's personal formula for weighing risks and benefits of medical treatment."   Ganzini's findings offer hope that psychiatrists and other physicians can predict which depressed patients are likely to have stable or unstable preferences regarding life-sustaining therapies.

<H2>Do Neuroleptics Help Negative Symptoms?</H2>
<HR>



	Positron emission tomography (PET) scans can monitor the effects of antipsychotic medication by visualizing the regions in the 
brain where the drugs block dopamine receptors.  In a report by Wolkin et al published in the March 1996 issue of the American Journal of 
Psychiatry, the researchers hypothesized that patients with schizophrenia with prominent negative symptoms would have a poorer response 
to treatment with the neuroleptic haloperidol.  They compared cerebral glucose metabolism in patients with schizophrenia before and after 
haloperidol treatment.  While haloperidol caused a decrease in prefrontal glucose metabolism and an increase in basal ganglia, this response 
was blunted in the patients with prominent negative symptoms (withdrawal, social problems, lack of energy, lack of concern about personal 
appearance, reduced ability to express emotion).  These patients also performed worse on tests of cognitive ability than those with less severe 
negative symptoms, whose scores improved after treatment.
<p>
	These results suggest that patients with prominent negative symptoms may have a poorer response to neuroleptic treatment because 
of differences in brain metabolism.

<H2>How Do Neuroleptics Reduce Psychosis?</H2></center>

 <HR>


	More than 50 years after the first neuroleptic was introduced as an antipsychotic treatment for schizophrenia, researchers are still trying to figure out just how these drugs work, according to a note in The American Journal of Psychiatry.  They know that the neuroleptic's action starts by blocking dopamine receptors, but the pathways through which the drug acts in the brain to reduce psychosis remains unknown.  Holcomb et al. ("Functional Sites of Neuroleptic Drug Action in the Human Brain: PET/FDG Studies With and Without Haloperidol," p 41, January 1996) studies a group of patients with schizophrenia who were taking haloperidol and used positron emission tomography and a measure of glucose (sugar) utilization to measure regional functional changes in neuronal activity.  
<P>
	Measurements were taken while the patients were taking the drug, five days after discontinuing the drug, and 30 to 35 days after haloperidol discontinuation.  There were no significant differences found after five days off the drug, suggesting that effects of discontinuation are not rapid, but differences were seen at 30 to 35 days.  
<P>
	This study helps explain the effectiveness of neuroleptics, since haloperidol decreased glucose utilization in areas in which functional alterations can lead to psychosis.

<A NAME = "risp1"><H2>RISPERIDAL HAS BENEFITS</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>

<P>
A recent study by Michael H. Konig, M.D., et al, revealed that persons with schizophrenia taking Risperidal (risperidone)--as compared with haloperidol and placebo--experienced fewer movement disorders such as rigidity and tremor, while still receiving relief for symptoms of schizophrenia.  Write Dr. Konig at Hillside Hospital, 75-59 263rd Street, Glen Oaks, NY 11004.

<P>
<A NAME = "rispe"><H2>RISPERIDONE</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>

<P>
In two 8-0 votes, a panel of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration voted on April 29 that risperidone is safe and
effective in treating schizophrenia.
<P>
The medication, much cheaper than clozapine and without the
dangerous side effect of agranulocytosis, could reach the
American market in a matter of months.
<P>
The FDA is still negotiating with risperidone's manufacturer,
Janssen Pharmaceutica, over guidelines for marketing the drug in
the United States. Great Britain and Canada recently approved it,
and Mexico is expected to do so shortly.
<P>
Risperidone is said to reduce or eliminate  psychosis and voices,
and it does not appear to cause sedation, blurred vision,
impaired memory, or muscle stiffness.
<P>
FDA approval of risperidone will mean that "thousands of young
people suffering from the life-threatening illness (of
schizophrenia) can have a chance to improve their lives -- lives
that have been too often ended or totally devastated by its
symptoms," declared Martin S. Willick, a psychiatrist, lecturer
at Columbia University and NAMI member, at the FDA hearing.
<P>
Speaking "as a parent of a schizophrenic son whose life has
been overwhelmingly affected by this disease," Willick noted
that consumers, family members and mental health professionals
were "enormously encouraged by the introduction of clozapine a
few years ago. We have seen some dramatic improvements and very
many good, though modest improvements."
<P>
But hundreds of thousands of patients -- including his son --
did not sufficiently respond to clozapine or other medications.
His son improved, but developed a potentially fatal blood
complication, and had to stop taking clozapine. Still, "the
improvement we saw...has given us hope that new drugs like
risperidone will help him as well," Willick said.
<P>
Thousands of Dollars Cheaper
<P>
No price has yet been established for risperidone in the U.S.,
which will be sold under the brand name Risperdal. But it is
expected to be cheaper than the average price of clozapine,
which requires expensive weekly blood monitoring, and together
the cost is more than $8,000 year. Risperdal is priced at less
than $800 in Canadian dollars for a year's supply.
<P>
Clinical trials of risperidone have inspired cautious optimism.
Wayne Fenton, MD and Beth Lee, RN at Chestnut Lodge Research
Institute in Rockville, MD report that several patients who have
not responded to other medications are responding well to
risperidone.
<P>
One of the patients at Chestnut Lodge said in a telephone
interview that she began to feel better after two weeks of taking
the medication.
<P>
Now, after eight months, she feels like a different per son:
"It's better than anything I've ever been on, and I've been on
everything. I don't hallucinate any more. I don't have delusions
or stereotyped thinking. I have a sense of humor now. I'm able to
communicate with people. I have a life now," she exclaimed.
<P>
Before risperidone, "I was pretty much a vegetable." She has
a volunteer job now, and hopes to go back to school in the
fall. Between episodes of her illness, she attended medical
school. "I want to catch up on lost time."
<P>
One NAMI member from Tennessee who has taken risperidone for a
year said in a telephone inter view that the medication has
alleviated his depression and "I'm thinking about getting a
job." Risperidone, he said, "is a pretty good medication, but I'm
still looking for a better one. It has caused me to gain a lot of
weight, and may be causing visual hallucinations."
<P>
His doctor speculates that the hallucinations may result more
from "the course of the illness than the risperidone," the NAMI
member noted.
<P>
Not a Miracle Drug
<P>
But neither Lee, the nurse at Chestnut Lodge, nor Kenneth Jobsan,
a psychopharmacologist in Knoxville, TN want to raise hopes too
high.
<P>
Some patients in Chestnut Lodge's relatively small study did not
respond well to risperidone, Lee said, and Jobson said only a few
of his patients have done better on it than on clozapine.
<P>
Three people who took risperidone "had a brief dramatic response
and then lost that response. We don't quite know why," Jobson
said.
<P>
Jobson did relate the story of a patient whose life may have been
saved by risperidone. The patient had to stop taking clozapine
when he was diagnosed with an aggressive lung cancer, for fear of
dangerous complications between clozapine and chemotherapy. 
<P>
Risperidone was substituted while the patient underwent
chemotherapy. Jobson said the lung cancer remains in remission,
and the patient has felt much better on risperidone than he ever
did on clozapine.
<P>
Families of people with schizophrenia have been anxious to see
risperidone available on the U.S. market for more than a year.
<P>
Many have expressed impatience with the FDA approval process.
"Several times a week, we get calls from family members who are
desperate because their relatives can't take clozapine or can't
afford it. They want to know how they can get risperidone, and
how soon other medications will be available," said NAMI Research
Advocate James Cromwell.
<P>
"We have to say, 'It's up to the FDA. But we are encouraged by
the action of the advisory committee.'"
<P>
Other Drugs in Pipeline
<P>
About 16 new medications to treat mental illnesses are in
development, according to the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
Association. NAMI has asked the FDA to speed up its approval
process for these drugs on the grounds that mental illnesses are
"life-threatening diseases."
<P>
Between 10 and 15 percent of patients with schizophrenia, for
example, commit suicide. If the FDA put drugs to treat mental
illness on a "fast track," they could be approved in six months.
<P>
In testimony before the FDA, NAMI Legal Affairs Director Ron
Honberg urged the FDA to ensure that "promising new treatments
for (mental) disorders are made available to those who need them
as quickly as possible."
<P>
The FDA should "place the same emphasis and priority on research
and development of new treatments for schizophrenia as is put
into finding cures for other devastating illnesses such as heart
disease, cancer and HIV. The magnitude and impact of
schizophrenia and other severe mental illness on society and on
the individuals who suffer from them is as profound as any other
disease affecting Americans today...
<P>
"New medications can mean the difference between suicide or
life-long suffering in back wards of state institutions on the
one hand and opportunities to live meaningful, independent and
productive lives in society on the other ...
<P>
"These treatments will also lead to decreases in indirect costs
related to dependence on entitlements and lost productivity,"
Honberg said.
<P>

<A NAME = "start"><H2>STARTING RISPERIDONE AFTER CLOZAPINE</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>

<P>
What is the concern about stopping clozapine to start
risperidone?
<P>
On September 21, 1994, in response to concerns expressed by the
families of people with schizophrenia, the National Institute of
Mental Health (NIMH) sponsored a workshop to explore the effects
of clozapine discontinuation and the availability of risperidone
(Risperdal), co-chaired by the authors.  During July and August
of 1994, NIMH began receiving telephone reports from patients'
families describing individuals with schizophrenia who had been
treated with clozapine and who were abruptly discontinued from it
and started on the newly available antipsychotic risperidone.  
<P>
In several cases, this rapid shift in medication was associated
with dramatic increases in clinical symptoms requiring
rehospitalization.  Existing guidelines for clozapine
discontinuation indicate that gradual tapering over one or two
weeks should take place.  Abrupt discontinuation should
only occur in response to severe side effects.
<P>
NIMH staff notified the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),
conducted a literature review, and contacted a number of clinical
investigators who have studied these drugs as well as
representatives of Janssen and Sandoz pharmaceutical companies
(the makers of risperidone and clozapine, respectively).  
<P>
The literature search revealed several case studies reporting
what was described as "rebounding psychosis" following
discontinuation of clozapine and one controlled clinical trial
comparing clinical symptomatology following abrupt
discontinuation of chlorpromazine vs. clozapine.  In
the latter study, a subgroup of patients experienced symptom
increases that exceeded the levels originally present.
<P>
What have clinicians found?
<P>
Several leading clinical scientists attending the workshop
recounted their experience with clozapine discontinuation.  Some
noted that patients might experience an increase in symptoms
(following withdrawal of clozapine) more rapidly than with
standard antipsychotic (AP) medications due to clozapine's
shorter elimination half-life and the more rapid dissipation of
its clinical effects.  
<P>
Investigators discussed several instances involving people
abruptly discontinued from clozapine who then deteriorated
clinically.  In some cases, there were physical reactions
including nausea, diarrhea, and other symptoms that might
represent withdrawal of a medication with strong
anticholinergic effects.  Increases in schizophrenia symptoms,
which in a few patients were reported to be more severe than
those prior to beginning clozapine, were also reported by several
clinical researchers. 
<P>
It is not known whether worsening of clinical symptoms is more
problematic when discontinuing clozapine than standard
anti-psychotic medication, and there is very little hard data on
this subject, a point emphasized by representatives of Sandoz and
the FDA.  Therefore, we cannot say with certainty that clinical
deterioration is more rapid, severe, or frequent following abrupt
clozapine discontinuation, despite anecdotal and small-sample
evidence noted above.
<P>
Additional clinical observations suggested that some patients
recently taken off clozapine could also be at increased risk for
developing extrapyramidal side effects (EPS).  It was noted that
some people who had never experienced severe EPS were quite
sensitive to them as they were taken off clozapine, although this
sensitivity was temporary.  
<P>
If such patients were switched to risperidone, there could be
potential problems with the interpretation of these symptoms. 
Since much of the information on risperidone has emphasized
its relative lack of EPS, motor side effects and excitement might
be misinterpreted as a worsening of psychosis rather than
akathisia, a form a EPS.
<P>
What do NAMI and Janssen say?
<P>
Dr. Dale Johnson, representing NAMI, indicated that NAMI too had
heard reports of clinical deterioration in people removed from
clozapine.  He noted that a number of people with
schizophrenia are bothered by the requirement for weekly blood
drawing as well as the side effects of clozapine and may want to
try new medications.  In some cases, people may be subject
to abrupt discontinuation of clozapine in order to switch to
alternative treatments.
<P>
Dr. Jennifer Hardin, representing Janssen, indicated that while
many patients are now being treated with risperidone, clinical
trials prior to marketing did not use large numbers of patients
who had been treated with clozapine (or were non-responders to
standard AP treatment), so they could not evaluate its value for
such patients.  
<P>
Language in the risperidone packaging originally indicated that
patients should be discontinued from other AP medications
immediately before starting risperidone.  Dr. Hardin noted that
labeling instructions were being modified to indicate that
patients beginning risperidone should no longer be rapidly
discontinued from previous AP treatments.  The package insert now
states:
<P>
There are no systematically collected data to specifically
address switching from other antipsychotics to Risperdal, or
concerning concomitant administration with other antipsychotics. 
While immediate discontinuation of the previous antipsychotic
treatment may be acceptable for some patients, more gradual
discontinuation may be most appropriate for other patients.  In
all cases, the period overlapping antipsychotic administration
should be minimized....The need for continuing existing EPS
medication should be reevaluated periodically.
<P>
What should consumers and families watch for?
<P>
To summarize, the NIMH recently brought together a group of
psychopharmacology research experts to discuss reports of
clinical deterioration (psychotic symptom increases, physical
withdrawal symptoms, and EPS) in some individuals with
schizophrenia who had been abruptly discontinued from clozapine. 
<P>

Consumers and families are reminded that the recommended
withdrawal schedule for clozapine indicates that ONE TO TWO weeks
should be expected for tapering off clozapine, and some
clinical researchers have suggested longer taper durations. 
SWITCHING FROM CLOZAPINE
TO RISPERIDONE DOES NOT MEAN THAT SUCH TAPERING IS UNNECESSARY. 
<P>
We have no evidence that risperidone is responsible for producing
the clinical problems reported, as similar reactions have been
described in some individuals abruptly discontinued from
clozapine due to side effects (prior to the introduction of
risperidone).  Those who wish to try risperidone
should also be aware that it may not produce all of the same
benefits as clozapine, and it has not been proven effective for
treatment-resistant schizophrenia.  
<P>
People who are doing well on clozapine and are able to tolerate
its side effects may not be good
candidates for clozapine discontinuation.  Questions raised by
family members about how best to make transitions from one
treatment to another may now stimulate much-needed studies on
these important issues and thereby help shape future research
designs.

<A NAME = "tardi"><H2>TARDIVE DYSKINESIA (TD)</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>

<P>
What is TD?
<P>
Tardive dyskinesia (TD), a term coined in 1964, describes a set
of  abnormal, involuntary movements of the orofacial area or
extremities.
<P>
TD  is thought to result from prolonged treatment with the
neuroleptic  (anti-psychotic) medications that help to control
symptoms of severe mental  illnesses, particularly schizophrenia.
Tardive means "late"; dyskinesia means "movement disorder."
<P>
What are the symptoms of TD?
<P>
The symptoms of TD range from occasional to continuous, and from
barely  perceptible to blatant. At one extreme are slight
movements such as involuntary blinking, lip-licking,
tongue-twitching or foot tapping -- symptoms that may go
unnoticed even by the patient, his/her family or doctor.
<P>
At the other extreme are conspicuous movements such as writhing,
rocking, twisting, jerking, flexing and stiffening of virtually
any or all parts of the body.
<P>
Fortunately, the occurrence of severe cases of TD is relatively
rare (about 5 percent).
<P>
How do anti-psychotic drugs increase the risk of TD?
<P>
No one knows for sure, yet, how anti-psychotic drugs do what
they're supposed to do, much less how they increase the risk of
TD.
<P>
This, however, is clear: antipsychotic drugs change how nerve
impulses jump from one set of nerve cells (pre-synaptic neurons)
across a gap (synapse) to another set of nerve cells
(post-synaptic receptors).
<P>
The impulses are carried by substances called
"neurotransmitters". Anti-psychotic drugs block a particular
neurotransmitter called "dopamine," allowing little of it to
reach the post-synaptic receptors.
<P>
It is assumed (but not proven) that dopamine blockades in
various nerve pathways of the brain cause the unwanted effects of
anti-psychotic drugs. However, dopamine blockades in one key
nerve path way may also be responsible for movement disorders
including TD.
<P>
According to one hypothesis, the dopamine blockade results in the
post-synaptic receptors becoming hypersensitive to the little
dopamine that does leak through.
<P>
Constant (and possibly in creasing) doses of medications may be
needed to keep dopamine from playing havoc with the hyper
sensitive receptors.
<P>
Perhaps no single hypothesis will ever fully explain TD because
it may not be a single disorder. Instead, TD may encompass two or
more disorders -- each with a different cause and treatment. 
<P>
Recent studies suggest that other neurotransmitters such as
norepinephrine, serotonin, and GABA may play a role in the
development of TD.
<P>
To date, it is thought that all commercially available
neuroleptic medications cause TD. The experimental neuroleptic
clozapine, which is scheduled to become available for use in
selected patients in the U.S.A., is thought to not cause TD.
<P>
This observation lends considerable hope to the possibility that
better anti-psychotic agents will be developed.
<P>
If anti-psychotic drugs can cause TD, why use them?
<P>
Research literature provides ample evidence that for most chronic
patients, anti-psychotic drugs offer higher reliability, greater
effectiveness, easier accessibility, and fewer hazards than any
other treatment.
<P>
One study indicates that the relapse rate of acute mental
illness in a group staying on anti-psychotic drugs in a one year
period is about seven to 10 percent. For those going off
medication, the recurrence rate is between 70 to 80 percent with
a year.
<P>
What can patients and their families do about TD?
<P>
Maintain frequent contact with a psychiatrist well trained in the
use of anti-psychotic drugs. Maintenance dosages should be kept
as low as possible and still control symptoms.
<P>
New research is finding that doses can be reduced if careful
attention is paid to "prodromal" or early warning signs of
psychosis.
<P>
They should be discontinued when no longer need ed. No one should
take these medicines if they are not benefiting from them.
Usually neuroleptic medications are prescribed on a long-term
basis for diagnoses of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder,
depression with psychotic features, bipolar illness and organic
brain syndromes.
<P>
Certainly, neuroleptics may be prescribed for additional
diagnoses, but if they are, it is important to discuss the
strategy with the prescribing psychiatrist.
<P>
Ask the psychiatrist to discuss the "risk-benefit ratio" of the
particular medication that is prescribed. Be alert to the
symptoms of TD as described in this pamphlet. Promptly call them
to the attention of your doctor. Support studies of TD and newer
neuroleptic medications.
<P>
How common is TD?
<P>
Long-term studies have determined that TD develops in 15 to 20
percent of the patients taking anti-psychotic drugs for several
years.
<P>
In the United States, where there are about 2 million people
afflicted with schizophrenia, that means at least 300,000 people
with TD.
<P>
Recent studies indicate that the average yearly incidence rate
(new cases) ranges from .04 to .08 per year. We see a relatively
constant rate of new cases during at least the first seven years
of treatment with neuroleptics. It is still unclear if this rate
continues to climb after this period of exposure.
<P>
Can patients at risk for developing TD be identified?
<P>
The risk of developing TD appears to be highest among elderly,
chronic patients who have taken the drugs for the longest
periods. That is all that is known at this time.
<P>
Is anyone doing research on TD?
<P>
Because of the increasing magnitude of the problem, much research
is underway. For example, the National Institute of Mental
Health has given a research team at Yale University almost
$1 million to find ways to decrease the major side effects of
antipsychotic drugs.
<P>
These researchers are developing alternate treatments, studying
risk factors, and experimenting with lowered drug doses to find
the point at which side effects disappear but the drugs are still
effective.

<H2>Neurobiological Brain Disorders: Does my child have one?</H2>
 <HR>
If you are a parent or guardian of a child that has been identified with a serious emotional disorder (SED), a neurobiological brain disorder (NBD), or mental illness, you are the best judge of your child's special needs and particular strengths.  Your direct and active participation in his or her treatment is essential to successful outcomes as your child receives services from the mental health and educational communities.
<P>
I've been told my child is seriously emotionally disturbed.  What does that mean?
<P>
Serious emotional disturbance (SED) is a broad term used by school systems to classify students that exhibit any of a wide variety of behavioral disorders or mental health problems.  These problems may be due to sociological or environmental causes (such as abuse, neglect, crime, poverty, or emotional, neurotic, or life-adjustment issues) but SED also includes children with neurobiological brain disorders (NBD).  
<P>
What are neurobiological disorders, or mental illnesses in children?
<P>
Neurobiological disorders, neurobiological brain disorders (NBD), and mental illness are terms used for a group of brain disorders that cause disturbances in thinking, feeling, or relating.  These disorders result in a substantially reduced capacity for coping with the ordinary demands of everyday life.  
<P>
Mental illnesses can affect persons of any age, including children and adolescents.  They can occur in any family, and they are not anyone's fault. 
<P>
What specific disorders, sometimes referred to by professionals as diagnostic categories, are considered neurobiological disorders?
<P>
Schizophrenia, schizo-affective disorder, bipolar disorder (manic depression), major depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, borderline personality disorder, autism, pervasive developmental disorders, Tourette's syndrome, and attention deficit disorder (with or without hyperactivity) are a class of severe and persistent neurobiological brain disorders.  
<P>
You can learn more about these disorders by consulting The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (referred to as "DSM-IV"), published by the American Psychiatric Association.  It is available in the reference section of most public libraries and in Alliance for the Mentally Ill (AMI) libraries.
How do I know if my child is affected?
<P>
If you suspect your child is ill, or if a teacher or school counselor suggests that your child should be evaluated, you should seek a professional's advice.  NAMI would recommend a psychiatric evaluation, preferably performed by a psychiatrist who specializes in children and adolescents.
<P>
How can I get an accurate diagnosis for my child?
<P>
Research in the biomedical field is ensuring more accurate diagnoses.  Well-qualified and licensed psychiatrists that can evaluate and make a diagnosis can be found in university-affiliated schools and hospitals and in private practice. 
<P>
Most younger psychiatrists, trained in the past 10 to 15 years, recognize that all brain disorders have a biological underpinning.  These medical doctors will outline the kind of treatment they believe will be most appropriate for your child.  You will want to choose a professional who respects your role and views the family not as part of the child's problem, but as a strength the child can build on.
<P>
What kind of treatments or programs should I be seeking for my child?
<P>
If you have been able to get an accurate diagnosis, you are well on your way.  Your child's psychiatrist may offer medication or a combination of medication and psychotherapy.  The doctor may suggest that another person(such as a social worker or psychologist(provide the therapy while he overseas the medication.  The therapist generally talks extensively with the child about his feelings and conflicts, his current problems, and how to establish good relationships with those around him.
<P>
Parents need to be informed about the goals of psychotherapy, behavior-management techniques, and family therapy.  Ask questions.  Find out the qualifications of various therapists.  Find out how long such therapies will last and how much they will cost.  Who will pay if you cannot?  Be an informed consumer.  Ask other families who have been through similar situations.  AMI and AMI-CAN families generally have answers to these and other questions you will have.
<P>
Where can I find out about medications that have been prescribed for my child?
<P>
First, ask the psychiatrist who prescribed them.  Questions you will want to ask include:  What symptoms might the medication alter?  When and how should the medication be taken?  What side effects should I be looking for?  What are the short- and long-term effects of the medications?  Are there any toxic side effects that the child may experience that I should tell the physician about immediately?  What strategies will lessen the side-effects normally associated with the medication.
<P>

Frueling at the Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology Information Center, University of Wisconsin, Department of Psychiatry, B6-227CSC, 600 Highland Ave., Madison, WI 53792-2475 (608/263-6171).

<H2>MENTAL ILLNESSES ARE TREATABLE . . .</H2>
<hr>

Mental Illnesses Are Treatable Neurobiological Disorders
<P>
Our nation's investment in mental illness research has been
paying outstanding dividends.  New medications and psychosocial
treatments resulting from this investment will more than pay for
their development costs by offsetting the tremendous burden now
borne by society.
<P>
For example, the 1969 introduction of lithium to treat
manic-depressive illness resulted in average yearly savings in
treatment costs of $290 million in the United States.
<P>
In this, the "Decade of the Brain", research supported by the
federal National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) -- now part of
the world-renowned National Institutes of Health (NIH) -- has
spawned revolutionary breakthroughs in treatment so that millions
of Americans can be helped to lead more productive, less painful
lives.
<P>
The 1990 introduction of clozapine to the U.S. market has
permitted thousands of previously treatment-resistant persons
with schizophrenia to regain social and economic productivity.
<P>
While the causes of mental illnesses remain unknown, data from
several major studies illuminate the role of biological factors
in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression,
obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder.  
<P>
The Cost Of Not Providing Care
<P>
Untreated or under-treated mental illness results in enormous
costs to society, including lost work, reduced productivity, and
prison recidivism.
<P>
The number of persons with mental illness among the homeless is
estimated to be between 200,000 and 350,000 persons.  There is a
shocking high rate of suicide among persons with severe mental
illnesses on our nation's streets, and in its shelters and jails.
<P>
The recent federal Interagency Task Force Report on Homelessness
and Severe Mental Illness " Outcasts on Main Street " vividly
depicts the personal and societal consequences of this failed
commitment to a vulnerable class of citizens.
<P>
In September, NAMI and Public Citizen Health Research Group
released a national study Criminalizing the Seriously Mentally
Ill: The Abuse of Jails as Mental Hospitals revealing that over
37,000  mentally ill individuals are now in jails, most charged
with simple misdemeanors such as loitering or trespassing.
<P>
Nearly one third of these persons have not been charged with any
crime; they have been arrested on "mercy bookings" because access
to mental health care is restricted or denied.  
<P>
A pervasive public stigma against persons with mental illnesses
manifests itself in countless ways, only one of which is in
insurance coverage.
<P>
Third-party payers typically cover the costs of treatment for
non-psychiatric or physical illnesses in full, or with minimum
patient contribution, while excluding or limiting coverage of the
treatment of mental (or psychiatric) illnesses. 
<P>
Schizophrenia and severe depressive illness are essentially
viewed by private industry and government as second-class
illnesses in this country.
<P>
Often private coverage is limited to $1000 a year for outpatient
care and 30 days of annual hospitalization with a $25,000
lifetime maximum, while similar limitations do not exist for the
treatment of cancer, diabetes or heart disease.
<P>
These misguided restrictions often force families to deplete
their lifetime savings, liquidate their homes and personal
belongings, and ultimately rely upon an under-funded and
overburdened public system.  
<P>
For persons fortunate to be enrolled in a minimally-acceptable
employer-provided insurance program, the irony is that
professional mobility is restricted because of industry-wide
"pre-existing condition" clauses.
<P>
Persons with severe mental illnesses are particularly impacted by
these restrictions, as mental illness often strikes during the
late teen years and early adulthood.
<P>
Many young persons find themselves in limbo -- too old to
continue coverage under their parents' policy and too young to be
in the workforce where insurance is generally purchased.  And
most persons diagnosed as mentally ill are unable to qualify for
any form of health insurance.
<P>
Insurance For Mental Illness Is Feasible
<P>
The debate over national health care reveals a concern that
insurance cannot support endless psychotherapy for "problems of
living" that affect the so-called "worried well". 
<P>
NAMI agrees that such non-medical interventions are not vital to
the needs of persons who suffer severe mental illnesses.
<P>
We do assert that advances in diagnosis and treatment for
specific, biologically-based, severe psychiatric disorders make
them relatively inexpensive additions to private coverage.
<P>
The cost of caring for persons with mental illnesses in the
community in the PACT Program of Dane County, Wisconsin has
reduced costs by two-thirds.
<P>
This model program, now 20 years old, is widely acknowledged to
offer state of the art treatment and support for persons with
severe mental illness.
<P>
In the 102nd Congress, a bipartisan group of twenty-one U.S.
Senators, led by Senator Pete V. Domenici and including then
Senator Albert Gore, Jr., co-sponsored legislation (S. 2696)
which would establish a comprehensive federal policy with respect
to provision of the health care coverage and services to persons
with severe mental illnesses.  
<P>
Several state legislatures have either enacted or considered
proposed legislation covering the more severe mental illnesses,
once presented with the relevant data outlining the incidence of
these illnesses and the modest medical treatment costs associated
with their management. 
<P>
Actuarial data on the costs/benefits associated with coverage of
the most severe mental illnesses have been instrumental in
convincing policy-makers across the country that these illnesses
can be included in insurance coverage at only a small additional
premium cost when set against a large pool of insured persons.
<P>
For example, the added cost of covering the biologically-based
mental illnesses on the same basis as other physical illnesses
for residents of the State of Maryland is estimated at
approximately $1.00 per covered person per month.
<P>
A Coopers and Lybrand study of residents of the State of
California yielded a $0.78 increase in premium cost. The federal
NIMH is currently evaluating national cost data for utilization
in the 103rd Congress.
<P>
In order to keep total costs within tolerable limits the Domenici
sponsors and certain state legislatures have recognized the need
to draw some  distinctions between the severe and persistent
illnesses and emotional distress associated with life events.
<P>
The costs of treatment of severe brain disorders are not
excessive as studies have proven, if the patient has available,
and adheres to, an integrated regime of treatment with
pharmacological agents, medical monitoring, and some supportive
services.  
<P>
Cost Containment Strategy
<P>
President Clinton has repeatedly stated his belief that
government must first serve those in our society who are most
vulnerable.
<P>
NAMI supports this position and believes that the direct and
indirect costs associated with the lack of adequate health care
coverage for people with severe mental illnesses far exceed the
costs associated with providing treatment services.
<P>
NAMI believes that mandating health insurance coverage for the
severe mental illnesses could slow the explosive growth of
Medicaid, SSI and SSDI since persons with mental illnesses are
the largest single group among those now covered.
<P>
Over time, more equitable coverage of persons with severe mental
illnesses will also stem the tide of persons with mental
illnesses in crisis now pouring into jails, emergency rooms, and
shelters.
<P>
People with severe mental illnesses are a growing burden on
public hospitals which face rapid escalation in the cost of
uncompensated care.
<P>
By shifting those specific costs to the private sector and
treating severe mental illnesses like any other major illness
such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease, an entire group of
vulnerable disabled people can avoid descent into poverty which
typically occurs when psychiatric benefits are exhausted but the
illness continues.
<P>
Managed Care And Managed Competition
<P>
Given the dismal failure of our present fee-for-service third
party reimbursement system, NAMI members view with cautious
optimism the new emphasis on organized systems of health care
delivery.
<P>
The emphasis within these delivery systems on the total care
management for the individual seeking treatment services could
well mitigate the problems associated with the fragmented funding
and delivery system which currently exists for persons with
severe mental illnesses and allow for a continuum of
medically-necessary and appropriate services.
<P>
In addition, the large health insurance purchasing groups should
certainly have the economic clout to negotiate more comprehensive
coverage of benefits than is presently available for small
employers and individuals, thereby assuring greater consumer
access to coverage. 
<P>
The fact that pre-existing condition exclusion clauses would be
repealed also removes a widespread barrier to insurance coverage
for persons with disabilities.
<P>
The managed competition model's reliance on treatment outcomes
and practice guidelines should promote greater accountability to
insurers and consumers alike that limited health care dollars are
utilized wisely and effectively. 
<P>
NAMI strongly calls for a role for consumers and family members
in the governance of these new health insuring structures as well
as in ongoing monitoring to assure high quality clinical services
in both hospital and outpatient settings.
<P>
At the same time, NAMI members join with our colleagues
throughout the disability community in wishing to reserve
judgement until a new delivery system is operational and fully
evaluated by consumers and their family members.
<P>
Our primary concern at this time is whether specialty care
services -- such as those provided by a psychiatrist to an
individual with a severe mental illness -- can be integrated into
the core benefit package likely to be required in any accountable
health plan.
<P>
The range of treatment needs for persons disabled by illness is
presently provided through the state Medicaid program through
several optional benefits.
<P>
Should Medicaid be repealed the discussion must immediately
center on how best to ensure access to rehabilitation,
pharmaceuticals, case management and other support services
within the framework of the managed care model.
<P>
The acute care insurance model with its emphasis on physician and
hospital services is critical to this population, but not nearly
sufficient.
<P>
The services provided through the public sector of government
(Medicaid and the state hospital system ) must continue to
be provided, either through direct inclusion in the basic
benefits package or perhaps through contracts or other
affiliations with existing public providers.
<P>
For the longer term services needed for full consumer functioning
in society, such as housing supports and vocational
rehabilitation services, NAMI insists that government continue to
support them categorically and with sufficient funding.
<P>
Continuous and timely access to specialized treatment and
rehabilitative services must be assured if in fact these services
are mandated within the managed care model.
<P>
With the emphasis on pre-paid capitated financing, an incentive
is inherently created to prudently manage the fixed health care
budget, perhaps to the point of discouraging access to
psychiatric specialty services. 
<P>
NAMI feels that for those individuals in need of more than
primary care services consideration be given to assigning a
psychiatrist as the primary care gatekeeper who would then be
responsible for managing that individual's treatment planning. 
<P>
All too often, our members report, general medical professionals
are poorly trained in the management of psychiatric illness and
lacking the continuing education to stay abreast of modern
effective treatment interventions.  
<P>
While severe mental illnesses cannot be prevented with the
current state of medical science, specific, recurring episodes of
psychosis, mania, depression and other aspects of the illnesses
can be prevented by early identification and early initiation of
good treatment regimens. 
<P>
Innovative programs such as those in Madison, Wisconsin and
Waterloo, Iowa feature a central authority, like the managed care
"gatekeeper" which is responsible for all aspects of treatment
and services provision.
<P>
In these example areas, the cost of treatment was reduced by more
than two-thirds in the years following implementation. Important
to the success of these integrated services models is the
continuous treatment, team concept which integrates and links
medical and social support services.
<P>
Summary
<P>
Given the broad agreement that coverage of severe mental illness
reduces societal costs in terms of homelessness, reliance on the
criminal justice system, and other social and welfare programs,
the following summarize NAMI policy objectives in health care
reform efforts:
<P>
-- Distinction between severe, disabling brain disorders and
emotional distress associated with problems of living in order to
keep program costs within reasonable limits. 
<P>
-- Attention and resources must be devoted to the needs of
persons with chronic and disabling illnesses in any acute care
model.
<P>
-- Integration of medical, rehabilitative and social support
services in the delivery system.
<P>
-- Attention to the needs of special populations, e.g. veterans,
children and ethnic minorities.
<P>
-- Attention to maintaining and equalizing guaranteed access to
long-term rehabilitation services when and if Medicaid support is
phased out.
<P>
-- Emphasis on treatment guidelines and treatment outcomes to
create accountability.
<P>
-- Consumer and family involvement in evaluation of program
effectiveness.

<font color="#FF0000" size="3"><H2>Prozac and pregnancy</H2>
<H4>by Laura Lee Hall, Ph.D.</H4></font>
<hr><P>
	A study published in the October 3 issue of The New England 
Journal of Medicine found that infants who had been exposed to 
Prozac (fluoxetine) during the third trimester of pregnancy were at 
risk for low birth weight and premature birth.  First-trimester use 
of Prozac was not associated with any problems.  This new finding 
contrasts with data from several previous studies that failed to 
find a link between Prozac and birth defects or other problems for 
women and their offspring.  Also, an accompanying editorial in the 
journal pointed out problems in the study.  The research attracted 
publicity because of a press release from the March of Dimes urging 
pregnant women and those planning to become pregnant to avoid 
taking Prozac.
<P>
	The New England Journal study compared the birth outcomes of 
482 women on Prozac with those taking no antidepressant medication 
at all.  The pregnant women taking Prozac were divided into two 
groups:  those taking the medication early in their pregnancy and 
those taking the medication throughout pregnancy.  The women taking 
Prozac had the following primary diagnoses:  depression (nearly 80 
percent), panic disorder (6.4 percent); bipolar disorder (5.8 
percent), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (4 percent).  Other 
variables distinguished between the two groups of women.  Women 
taking Prozac more frequently took other psychotropic medications, 
were older as a group, and smoked more frequently (especially women 
in their third trimester taking Prozac).  These women, especially 
those who took the medication throughout pregnancy, may also have 
had a more severe and/or disabling illness.  All of these factors 
could have influenced the results and limited the interpretation of 
the study's results.
<P>
	Women taking Prozac in their first trimester experienced no 
increase in major anomalies (such as cleft palate and heart 
defects) in their offspring, but there was an increase in multiple 
minor anomalies, which were not listed in the article.
<P>
	Taking any medication during pregnancy requires a careful risk 
analysis: the benefits of treatment versus no treatment.  Because 
serious mood disorders can be life-threatening, effective treatment 
is important.  Prozac's manufacturer (Eli Lilly) recommends that 
Prozac not be given to pregnant women, even though the majority of 
studies to date do not link Prozac with problems in pregnancy or 
birth defects.  People with concerns about this or other 
medications for brain disorders should consult with their doctors 
and consider the risks and benefits for them as individuals.

<H2>Siblings with Schizophrenia Sought</H2>
<HR>
  If you know of two siblings with schizophrenia, please tell their family about a genetic study for them 
at the National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland.  They will be helping to find what causes 
this illness, and they will be paid for a blood sample and an interview.  No travel is required.  For information, 
call Dr. Pablo Gejman, collect, at 301/496-8977, or write NIMH, Bldg. 10, Rm. 3N 218,

<H2>Support Groups Yield Better Family Coping</H2>
<HR>
	A study by Phyllis Solomon, Ph. D., and Jeffrey Draine, M.S.W., reported in the November 1995 issue of Psychiatric Services, 
sought to describe factors associated with adaptive coping by family members with a psychiatrically disabled relative.
<p>
	Study results showed that more adaptive coping was associated with increased social support as measured by the density of the 
social network, the extend of affirming social support, and participation in a support group for families.  Better coping was also associated 
with a greater sense of self-efficacy in dealing with the relative's mental illness.  Adaptive coping was not associated with the severity of the 
relative's illness.
<p>
	The findings suggest that families will benefit from joining support groups.

<H2>Keeping a Lid on Ritalin</H2>
<HR>


	"Touted as a wonder drug for children with attention deficit disorders, methylphenidate [Ritalin] is also muscling its way into the 
illicit drug culture with a speed that alarms substance abuse counselors and federal drug experts," according to an article by Laura Sessions 
Stepp for The Washington Post (2/5/96).  "Kids      seek it out," writes Stepp, "believing it will help them study better and party harder.  With 
more than two million children taking it legally, procuring it illegally is a cinch--a cousin's medicine cabinet, a deal cut in the school 
bathroom, a mother's bedside table."
<p>
	In a companion article in the Post on the same day, Stepp reported that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) holds that, if 
snorted or taken in larger-than-therapeutic does, methylphenidate can cause tremors, hypertension, even stroke.  "Those who work with 
children taking methylphenidate say parents need to keep a tight lid  on when and how the pills go out," says Stepp.

<H2>Mild Caution About Ritalin</H2>
<HR>
	A New York Times article (1/13/96) reported that "Government scientists have uncovered a sign that the widely used children's drug Ritalin might cause cancer in mice.  But they say parents should not stop giving their children the drug, used to treat hyperactivity, based on such weak findings."
<p>
	The Times quoted Dr. Murray Lumpkin, the Food and Drug Administration's deputy drug director as saying, "We felt physicians and parents should know this and have a right to know this.  But it's not enough of a signal that we think kids should be taken off the drug."
<p>
	"The agency said it had evidence that the drug was not carcinogenic, including the fact that in people there had been no increase in 20 years in the rare type of liver cancer involved in the study of mice," the Times reported.

In 1993, America spent less on medical research in the entire year than it did on health care in ten days.  Ninety-one percent of Americans, according to a nationwide Harris Poll, believe the United States should spend more on medical research to better diagnose, prevent, and treat disease. 
<P>
These facts--highlights from "Medical Research:  Progress and Promise for the Patient," a Research!America Forum consensus statement--drive home the need to promote medical research as an integral element of healthcare reform.
<P>
The consensus statement (with the endorsement of about 150 organizations, including NAMI, then and 217 organizations now) was hand-delivered to every member of Congress, sent to the White House, and forwarded to policy leaders at health and research-related agencies.

<P>
A gene, or possibly two, that could contribute to as many as one in four cases of manic depression may be on a region of chromosome 18, according to a study of 395 members of 22 families by Wade H. Berrettini and colleagues at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. 
<P>
Manic depression or recurrent depression afflicted 167 participants in the study; in eight of the families, similar genetic variations on chromosome 18 were identified.  Although this means almost two-thirds of the families had no evidence of involvement by chromosome 18, that alone would not rule out the locations:  Most scientists seeking the genetic basis of manic-depressive illness agree that more than one genetic miscue probably can set the state for, or cause, the disorder. 
<P>
The study, reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (June 21), noted two genes worthy of suspicion out of the approximately 100 genes on chromosome 18.  One codes for a protein that plays a specific part in chemical signal reception; the other is involved in stress hormone production, a physiological function that has been shown to go into overdrive in both depression and manic depression.

<P>
A study of the recognition and treatment of depression has found that only 23 percent of depressed patients who could benefit from anti-depressants were receiving these medications and 39 percent of them were getting sub-therapeutic doses. 
<P>
Published in the May 1994 American Journal of Psychiatry, the study by Dr. Kenneth B. Wells of the RAND Corporation also found that patients of psychologists and allied mental health professionals were less likely to receive anti-depressants regardless of the severity of their illness.  Additionally, depressed patients in HMOs were twice as likely to receive fewer visits and to be treated with anti-anxiety medications instead of anti-depressants. 
<P>
These results reinforce previous research showing that insufficient numbers of depressed patients are receiving appropriate treatment and that clinicians often fail to provide the kinds of treatment indicated by efficacy studies.

Wolfram syndrome is a rare inherited disorder that leads to an array of symptoms, including diabetes mellitus and blindness.  More important, the syndrome's victims usually suffer from severe nervous system abnormalities that can be accompanied by behavior problems, psychiatric hospitalizations and--in 25 percent of cases--suicide attempts. 
<P>
Now scientists at the National Center for Human Genome Research's Laboratory of Genetic Disease Research and the New York Medical College have used a kind of genetic assessment called linkage analysis to home in on the likely location of the Wolfram gene:  the short arm of chromosome 4.
<P>
Wolfram syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means that to be affected, an individual must inherit two mutated genes, one from each parent.  Between one in 50,000 to 100,000 people in this country inherit Wolfram syndrome. 
<P>
Although the syndrome itself is rare, experts estimate that about 1 in 100--or as many as 2.5 million Americans--possess a single copy of the mutated gene.  Because these individuals, as well as close relatives of people with Wolfram syndrome, experience higher-than-normal rates of psychiatric illness, eventual isolation of the gene may shed light on the contribution of genes to psychiatric disorders.
<P>
Armed with that information, investigators hope to identify the function of a gene that, they note, "may be responsible for a significant proportion of psychiatric illness in the general population."  Senior author of the Wolfram gene study was Mihael H. Polymeropoulos of the Laboratory of Genetic Research at the Division of Intramural Research.  It was published in the September 1994 issue of Nature Genetics.

Rodent pelts stored in museums since the late 1800s provide the first evidence that Lyme disease (borrelia burgdorferi) caused by tick bites has been around in the U.S. for at least 100 years.  This disease, which is rapidly increasing in certain areas, has been shown to have neuropsychiatric manifestations in a paper by Brain A. Fallon, M.D., et al, titled "The Neuropsychiatric Manifestations of Lyme Borreliosis."  The study can be obtained from Morris Area Lyme Support, P.O.Box 1483, Morristown, NJ 07960.  201/267-4251.

According to a recent study at the Duke University Medical Center, some cases of autism may be associated with a family history of depressive illness.  Autism, a disorder marked by social withdrawal and an inability to interact with the environment, seems to appear more frequently in families with a strong history of bipolar illness, the study found.
<P>
In connection with his study of 40 autistic children, Duke researcher Dr. Robert DeLong reported in the journal Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology that in 14 of the cases reviewed there was a strong family history of depression or manic depressive illness. 
<P>
The study hypothesized that when manic depression strikes in early infancy, it may blunt the child's cognitive, social, and emotional development irreversibly, so that the child's brain never develops the framework in which to build communications skills.  In extreme cases, this may lead to clinical autism.  (Reprinted from the National DMDA Newsletter, vol. 7, no. 1)

The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) recently published a background paper, Mental Disorders and Genetics:  Bridging the Gap Between Research and Society, that reflects discussion at a 1993 workshop cosponsored by OTA and NIMH.  The paper updates research on the genetics of selected mental disorders and considers the implications of these studies for future research, clinical practice, and society at large. 
<P>
Research makes clear that genetic factors contribute to many of the severe mental disorders discussed in the report.  "Indeed, researchers have already located, and in some cases identified, specific genes involved in Alzheimer's disease.   The consistent evidence for a genetic contribution to schizophrenia and major mood disorders, together with the rapid advances in molecular genetics, makes continued research in this area a promising endeavor. 
<P>
But progress is likely to be slow, given the complexity of theses conditions," write the authors.  Workshop testimony also made clear that genetic research carries with it clinical, ethics, and social implications.  People with mental disorders and their families worry about the genetic risk for a serious mental disorder that their family members may face.  
<P>
They welcome the de-stigmatizing influence of this research.  Yet they fear its potential abuse.  Unfortunately, a gap separates scientifically based information from the people who need it:  people with mental disorders, their family members, care providers, and society in general.  Copies of the 64-page paper are available for $4.25 through the Government Printing Office bookstores (202/512-1800).  The stock number is 052-003-01392-4

<P>
Comparing the brains of 22 men and women undergoing psychiatric evaluation in cases of murder or attempted murder with the brains of 22 control subjects, scientists at the University of Southern California (USC) and the University of California at Irvine (UCI) found significantly lower rates of glucose uptake in the medial and lateral sections of the prefrontal cortex brain regions of the research subjects compared to the controls. 
<P>
Researchers used positron emission tomography to measure glucose uptake in various brain areas during the performance of simple, repetitive tasks.   Study director Adrian Raine, Ph.D., said the study--published in the July issue of Biological Psychiatry and reported in the September issues of the Psychiatric Times--is the first to establish an activity deficit in a group of severely violent criminals. 
<P>
Because of the selected nature of the sample, however, the findings cannot yet be generalized to other violent populations, nor can this test yet be used as a predictor.

<P>
Neuroscientist Looks Inside The Brain
<P>
by Carol Rees, NAMI Board Member
<P>
To Dr. Daniel Weinberger, schizophrenia is arguably the worst
disease affecting mankind, even including AIDS. The disease has
ruined the lives of millions of people.
<P>
That's why he's so excited about the research he's doing as chief
of the Clinical Brain Disorders branch at the National Institute
of Mental Health.
<P>
In talks at the NAMI 1992 convention in Washington, and again on
September 16, 1992 at the University of Michigan Department of
Psychiatry, Weinberger discussed his hypotheses about
schizophrenia as a brain disorder that alters the structure,
function, and chemical mechanisms of the brain.
<P>
New technology such as CAT scans (computerized axial tomography)
and MRI's (magnetic resonance imaging) have taught
neuroscientists much about the brain, Weinberger says, as have
two studies of identical and fraternal twins, and observations of
laboratory rats with behaviors that mimic schizophrenia.
<P>
Schizophrenia changes the brain's anatomy, he says. Some of the
changes may be subtle, and include enlarged ventricles, decreases
in brain mass, and decreases in the size of a small structure at
the base of the brained call hippocampus.
<P>
Such changes are present before symptoms first appear in patients
with schizophrenia, possibly from birth, Weinberger says.
<P>
Functional alterations in the brain can be observed from
communication between the limbic system (of which the hippocampus
is a part) and the prefrontal cerebral cortex ("gray matter"),
where information processing takes place.
<P>
Chemical alterations in the brain can be observed when a
schizophrenic patient over-reacts to stress. These patients show
a greater sensitivity to dopamine receptors in the brain.
<P>
One underlying problem in schizophrenia, according to Dr.
Weinberger, is a malfunction of nerve cells that connect the
limbic system to the pre-frontal cortex.
<P>
This leads to a loss of ability to remember and to use
information to guide decisions.
<P>
This can be demonstrated with the Wisconsin Card Sort test, a
simple sorting exercise in which cards are sorted according to
designs on the cards.
<P>
Persons with schizophrenia have difficulty sorting the designs,
even though they are told how to do it (by color or shape)
immediately before they begin.
<P>
The persist in responding in an inappropriate way, showing that
they are unable to make use of information they have just been
given.
<P>
This kind of memory loss has not been previously noted as a
characteristic of schizophrenia, because it was masked by the
delusions and hallucinations that accompany the illness.
<P>
Dr. Weinberger says a condition similar to schizophrenia can be
induced in laboratory rats by creating a lesion in the area just
back of the pre-frontal cortex. The animals become highly active
when placed in a novel environment, and they react to mild
stresses as it if were life-threatening.
<P>
The results of stress are long-lasting; even seven days later,
the rats still have an excess of dopamine. Even though the lesion
is present in the rat's brain from the first week of life, this
reaction does not occur until after puberty, just as with
schizophrenia.
<P>
An additional insight gained by this line of research is the
connection between brain age and the appearance of symptoms.
Perhaps a brain must reach a certain state of development before
schizophrenia can occur.
<P>
At earlier ages, people may be protected from decisions by adults
who make decisions on their behalf. Maturity may bring both the
necessity of using information independently to guide behavior,
and an increase in stress, precipitating the onset of psychoses.
<P>
If abnormal cells in the brain's internal communication system
can explain much of what characterizes schizophrenia, then
treatment can be directed at finding ways to prevent this injury
in early life, and to develop drugs that improve communication,
rather than just the ones that affect neurotransmitters.
<P>
Author's note: listening to Dr. Weinberger, and having lunch with
him after his University of Michigan presentation helps me to be
more understanding of my son when he seems unable to heed what we
tell him. It brings home that we are getting closer to an
explanation (and better treatment) for this devastating disease.

<A NAME = "newdi"><H2>NEW DISCOVERY OF MOLECULE IN BRAIN</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
Studies by scientists at The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions suggest that the brain uses a common chemical to adjust the speed and intensity of the messages carried through its circuits.  Researchers showed that adding a phosphate molecule to brain cells can make it easier for messages to go through.  The demonstration provides important insight into the tools the brain uses to create learning and memory.  The same tools may also play a role in brain damage from strokes and other disorders.
<P>
Richard Huganir, Ph.D., associate professor of neuroscience and an associate investigator at Howard Hughes Molecular Genetics Institute, studied phosphate molecules' effects on certain receptors, sites on nerve cells that open in response to chemical messengers from other nerve cells. 
<P>
While the receptors are open, calcium and sodium from around the nerve cell flow into it, triggering a series of electrical and chemical chain-reactions that transmit the message up the nerve cell.  "A single receptor that we studied probably has 10 to 20 different sites where this phosphate molecule can be added, and each of these sites has different effects on the receptor," explains Huganir.  "
<P>
At one site, phosphorylation increases the amount of time the receptor is open," says Huganir.  "Another affects the concentration of receptors, causing more to gather in a particular area."  When a receptor is open longer or more receptors are gathered together, more of the calcium surrounding the cell flows into it, making the message come through more easily and more strongly.
<P>
Huganir presented his findings at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience in November in Miami Beach.

<A NAME = "newge"><H2>NEW GENE LINKED TO BIPOLAR DISORDER</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
In the largest study to date using linkage analysis for bipolar, researchers at New York State Psychiatric Institute, part of columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York, and the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center in Jerusalem have found evidence that a region on chromosome 21 contains a gene for the disorder. 
<P>
The study involved more than 900 people from 47 families in the U.S. and Israel with a high concentration of bipolar disorder.  One U.S. family consisting of 67 individuals included 18 members who had diagnoses ranging from bipolar disorder to recurrent major depression to cyclothymia.  The researchers found that DNA markers from region q22.3 of chromosome 21 gave evidence of linkage to the disorder in this family and, possibly, in other families as well.
<P>
The study comes on the heels of other recent findings showing a possible site on chromosome 18, which may also be partly responsible for manic-depressive symptoms.  Still earlier studies have shown a possible relation between chromosome 11 and bipolar illness.  (Reprinted from the National DMDA Newsletter, vol. 7, no. 1)
<P>


<A NAME = "newst"><H2>NEW STUDY ON BIPOLAR DISORDER</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
A new treatment-outcome and research network dedicated to the study of manic-depressive illness, the Stanley Foundation Bipolar Network, includes national and international researchers and expert clinicians working in close association with NAMI and the National Depressive and Manic-Depressive Association (NDMDA). 
<P>
These groups will work together to assess the efficacy of existing treatments for bipolar disorder and the development of new therapeutic agents.  Participating research centers will recruit and treat patients with bipolar illness using standard protocols and assessments within randomized clinical trials. 
<P>
"The mission of the bipolar network is to advance the scientific knowledge and understanding of bipolar illness, its cause or causes, and its treatments with the goals of establishing optimal treatment strategies," said Robert Post, M.D., chief of the Biological Psychiatry Branch of NIMH.

<H2>Green Bay Packer Defends Persons with Brain Disorders</H2>
 <HR>


	On December 1, 1995, Lionel Aldridge encouraged individuals with brain disorders (mental illnesses) to join the workforce during a job fair held in Washington, D.C.   After his successes as a defensive end in two Super Bowls for Vince Lombardi's legendary Green Bay Packers, Mr. Aldridge suffered schizophrenia and was homeless for two-and-a-half years.  Through sharing his personal experience, Mr. Aldridge inspired others to follow their dreams.  His advice: "Don't let others determine who you are or who you can be."
<P>	Close to two hundred individuals attended the Washington, D.C., Mental Health Consumer League's event, entitled "Yes We Can: Job Opportunities For Mental Health Consumers." 
<P>	"Having Lionel Aldridge speak at the job fair was the highlight of the participants' day.  He is a role model who has experienced the same challenges that face persons with brain disorders," commented Regina Duvall, co-coordinator of the job fair and NAMI member.  "Lionel's most important message was that even though you have a mental illness, you should not allow yourself to feel less of a person.  His self-esteem is both courageous and contagious."

<H2>The Best of Times, The Worst of Times</H2>
by Laura Lee Hall, Ph.D., Deputy Director of Policy and Research 

 <HR>


Note:  The following remarks were presented at a symposium on 
schizophrenia research sponsored by the National Foundation for 
Brain Research and NAMI in March 1996 at the U.S. Congress.
<p>

	The reality of schizophrenia in America in 1996 harkens back 
to Charles Dickens famous opening to A Tale of Two Cities-
about it being the best of times and the worst of times.  
People with schizophrenia, as perhaps in no other time in 
history, confront an almost unbelievable sense of hope for 
effective treatment and high quality of life as well as fears of 
tragedy and suffering.  
<p>
	Yes, in many ways, these are the best of times.  Not so long 
ago, schizophrenia was considered an enigma, a hopeless illness, 
a dark family secret, a scourge, moral failing, certainly a 
desert and no-man's-land for scientists and doctors. The noted 
historian, Gerald Grob, has written that in the 1940s the 
obstacles blocking fundamental biological research into mental 
illnesses were formidableit would have been impossible to 
predict that.scientists would develop substances that had the 
potential to modify the symptoms associated 
with...schizophrenia.
<p>
	Yet there have been tremendous advances in schizophrenia 
science.  In the last year alone, there were reports documenting 
developmental hazards-such as Rh incompatibility between mother 
and fetus and extreme malnutrition during fetal development-
that double the risk of schizophrenia.  Several studies 
pinpointed the regions of the brain that are structurally and 
functionally altered in schizophrenia.  A major paper reported 
that a gene contributing to schizophrenia is likely to be located 
on chromosome 6.  Reported data evidenced the effectiveness of a 
new schizophrenia drug-olanzapine-making it the third new 
drug for schizophrenia made available in a few short years, after 
literally decades of no medication advances.  Another ten-year 
study presented this year showed that effective medical treatment 
coupled with intensive community supports and employment services 
led to a 50 percent employment rate for this population.  
<p>
	These and other data represent stunning progress.  To quote 
a prominent schizophrenia researcher-Dr. Danny Weinberger-20 
years ago, the principal challenge for schizophrenia research was 
to gather objective scientific evidence that would implicate the 
brain.  This challenge no longer exists...no longer can there be 
any doubt that there is an underlying brain pathology.
<p>
	Schizophrenia is a brain disorder.  It is not a problem of 
living.  It is not a philosophical dilemma.  It is not the result 
of your mothers not breast-feeding you as a child.  
Schizophrenia is a brain disorder.  
<p>
	Of course much more research needs to be done, but 
schizophrenia science is a mature, sophisticated science, with 
all of the tools of modern biomedicine, molecular biology, 
genetics, brain imaging, pharmacology, and services research. 
Most importantly, there is a growing arsenal of effective 
treatments and support services that reduce symptoms, decrease 
hospitalization, improve functioning and quality of life, and 
even employment outcomes.    
<p>
	These are really the best of times.  
<p>
	But, these are also the worst times imaginable.  
Approximately 1.7 million American adults have the brain disorder 
called schizophrenia.  No more than 15 percent of them have a 
job.  They make up more than half of the long-term residents of 
state and county mental hospitals. They, and others with severe 
mental illnesses, make-up at least one-third of our nations 
homeless population.  Between 10 and 15 percent of individuals 
with schizophrenia commit suicide, usually before the age of 30. 
<p>
 For 20 percent or more, schizophrenia is a chronically 
deteriorating illness; for most people with this brain disorder, 
it follows a long-term course, with relapses of frightening 
symptoms and prolonged disability.  Approximately 8 percent of 
people in our jails have schizophrenia and other severe mental 
illnessesthey are usually housed there for want of appropriate 
treatment and housing facilities.  People with schizophrenia and 
other severe mental illnesses are disproportionately the victims 
of crime.  
<p>
	So, despite tremendous progress in research, the reality of 
schizophrenia is in many ways a very grim onefor people with 
this illness, for their families, and for our nation.  This grim 
reality certainly reflects the nature of this chronic brain 
diseasebut it also reflects failed policies.  To again quote 
the historian Grob:  Americans have yet to define a mental 
health policy that integrates decent and humane care with access 
to medical services for severely and chronically mentally ill 
persons.  
<p>
	What are the policy implications of our profound research 
success and the desperate plight of so many people who suffer the 
disease of schizophrenia?
<p>
	First, we must redouble our schizophrenia research efforts. 
 Great discoveryindeed breakthrough is within our grasp.  We 
have the research tools, we have some of the best brains in 
scientific research, and we have answerable scientific questions.
<p>
	The scientific opportunity is upon us.  We must increase the 
amount of research on this disease.  Congress and NIMH must make 
this a top research priorityand increase funding and focus on 
schizophrenia research.
<p>
	The research we rightly celebrate is but a seed for the 
research successes within our grasp, if only we would truly 
reach.  This schizophrenia research is also the seed of informed 
and humane policy.  Research data tell us to reject 
discrimination against schizophrenia, to make available the 
effective treatments, services, and supports that we now have to 
the people who need it.  Only by enhancing research, ending 
insurance discrimination, and assuring access to effective 
treatment and services can we ensure that every person with 
schizophrenia will realize his or her best possible recovery.  
Lets abide by and build on the successes of schizophrenia 
research-and make these simply the best of times.

<P>
What's happening?
<P>
Imagine you've just stepped into an elevator and suddenly your
heart races, your chest aches, you break out in a cold sweat and
feel as if the elevator is about to crash to the ground. What's
happening?
<P>
Imagine you are driving home from the grocery store and suddenly
things seem to be out of control, you feel hot flashes, things
around you blur, you can't tell where you are, and you feel as if
you're dying. What's happening?
<P>
What's happening is a panic attack, an uncontrollable panic
response to ordinary, nonthreatening situations. Panic attacks
are often an indication that a person has panic disorder.
<P>
What is panic disorder?
<P>
A person who experiences four or more panic attacks in a 4-week
period is said to have panic disorder. Panic disorder may also be
indicated if a person experiences fewer than four panic episodes
but has recurrent or constant fears of having another panic
attack.
<P>
Doctors often try to rule out every other possible alter native
before diagnosing panic disorder. To be diagnosed as having panic
disorder, a person must experience at least four of the following
symptoms during a panic attack: sweating; hot or cold flashes;
choking or smothering sensations; racing heart; labored
breathing; trembling; chest pains; faintness; disorientation; or
feelings of dying, losing control, or losing one's mind.
<P>
Panic attacks can occur in anyone. Chemical or hormonal
imbalances, drugs or alcohol, stress or other situational events
can cause panic attacks, which are often mistaken for heart
attacks, heart disease, or respiratory problems.
<P>
What are phobias?
<P>
Phobias are irrational, involuntary and inappropriate fears of
(or responses to) ordinary situations or things. People who have
phobias can experience panic attacks when confronted with the
situation or object about which they feel phobic.
<P>
The American Psychiatric Association recognizes a category of
symptoms called phobic disorders within the broader field of
anxiety disorders.
<P>
Phobias are divided into three types: Single (simple) phobia: an
unreasonable fear of specific circumstances or objects, such as
snakes or traffic jams.
<P>
Social phobia: extreme fear of making a spectacle of oneself in
public, thus forcing one to avoid public occasions or areas.
<P>
Agoraphobia: literally (in Greek) "In fear of the market place."
An intense fear about feeling trapped in any situation,
particularly in public places, combined with an overwhelming fear
of having a panic attack in unfamiliar surroundings
<P>
Phobias are usually chronic (long term) distressing and
restrictive disorders. They can lead to other serious problems,
such as depression.
<P>
In fact, at least half of those who suffer with phobias and panic
disorders experience depression. Alcoholism, loss of
productivity, feelings of shame, secrecy, and low self-esteem
also occur.
<P>
Some people develop a pathologic dependency and are unable to go
anywhere or do anything without the assistance of others they
trust.
<P>
What does it mean to "Fear the Fear"?
<P>
Many people with phobias or panic disorder "fear the fear," or
worry about when the next attack is coming Anticipatory anxiety,
or the fear of more attacks, can be debilitating.
<P>
People who are prone to panic attacks often begin to avoid the
things  they think triggered the panic attack, thus limiting the
things they do or the places they go.
<P>
Am I the only one?
<P>
Two to five percent of Americans are thought to suffer panic
disorder, so you are not alone if you experience these symptoms.
Most often, panic disorder first strikes people in their early
twenties. A severe life stress, such as the death of a loved one,
can precipitate panic attacks.
<P>
A 1986 study by the National Institute of Mental Health showed
that 51 percent to 12.5 percent of people surveyed had
experienced phobias in the past 6 months. The study estimated
that 24 million Americans will experience some phobias in their
lifetimes.
<P>
Phobias are the leading psychiatric disorders among women of all
ages. One survey showed that 4 9 percent of women and 18 percent
of men have panic disorder, agoraphobia, or other phobias.
<P>
What causes panic disorder?
<P>
No one really knows what causes panic disorder, but several
theories are being researched. Panic disorder seems to run in
families, and this suggests the disorder has some genetic
inheritability or predisposition.
<P>
Some theories suggest that panic disorder is part of a more
generalized anxiety in the people who experience panic attacks or
that severe separation anxiety can develop into panic disorder or
phobias, most often agoraphobia.
<P>
Cognitive theorists believe that one's "wrong thinking" maintains
an anxiety level that can trigger panic attacks.
<P>
Biological theories point to possible physical defects in a
person's autonomic (or automatic) nervous system. General
hypersensitivity in the nervous system, increased arousal, or a
sudden chemical imbalance can trigger panic attacks.
<P>
Caffeine, alcohol, and several other agents can also trigger
these symptoms.
<P>
Researchers have found that sodium lactate, when injected into
the blood stream of some people who are predisposed to panic
attacks, will induce such attacks This suggests that people who
experience panic attacks may have trouble metabolizing lactate, a
substance usually produced by muscles during exercise
<P>
Is panic disorder treatable?
<P>
Recovery from panic disorder appears to be most successful when
a combination of treatments is used in fighting the disorder.
<P>
Most often, medication is used to block panic attacks, and when
it is used in combination with cognitive or behavioral therapy,
it allows people to overcome their fears and return to normal,
functional living.
<P>
Sadly, although treatments can be quite successful -- 75 percent
to 90 percent of those treated show significant improvement only
about one quarter of those who suffer this disorder ever seek
appropriate treatment.
<P>
Cognitive therapy is used to help people think and behave
appropriately, thus making the feared object or situation less
threatening through supported exposure and hierarchical
desensitization (being exposed to, and slowly getting used to,
the thing that is so frightening).
<P>
Family members and friends play an important role in this process
as they provide support, assistance, and encouragement.
<P>
Medication is most effective when used as part of a more
comprehensive treatment plan that involves supportive therapy.
Antidepressants, such as imipramine and phenelzine, and
antianxiety agents, such as alprazolam, are most successful.
<P>
Beta blockers, which limit neuron activity in the brain, are
helpful with social phobias. If you are seeking medical
treatment, ask your doctor about these medications or others that
may help you.
<P>
Psychotherapy and healthy living habits are also believed to help
people overcome the burdens placed on them by panic disorder.
Exercise, a proper and balanced diet, moderate use of caffeine or
alcohol, and reduced stress can help tremendously.
<P>
Peer support is a vital part of overcoming panic disorder. Family
and friends can play a significant role in the treatment process
and should be informed of the treatment plan and of the ways they
can be most helpful.

<P>
A study of treatments for recurrent depression revealed that a more aggressive medication strategy than typically prescribed for remitted patients was successful in keeping patients well for a longer period of time.  The results indicated that the dosage used to get the patient better stood the best chance for keeping the patient better. 
<P>
Patients who did not remain on the high does of medication were up to 11 times more likely to suffer another episode of depression than were the patients who remained on full-dose medication during the three-year study.
<P>
When these findings were published in 1990, Dr. Kupfer, Dr. Ellen Frank, and their collaborators at the NIMH Mental Health Clinical Research Center for the Study of Affective Disorders did not yet know what would happen to these patients beyond the three-year point. 
<P>
They then asked those individuals who remained well throughout the three-year trial period on active medication (with or without psychotherapy) to continue in a two-year additional randomized clinical trial of active medication versus placebo. 
<P>
The question was whether maintaining antidepressant medication at the dose used to treat the acute episode beyond the three years would continue to have a significant preventative effect compared to medication discontinuation after the three years of effective maintenance treatment. 
<P>
As with the three-year study, data analysis demonstrated a highly significant preventative effect for continued active medication maintained at the dosage level prescribed when the patient was acutely depressed.  Based on the results of the five-year study, Dr. Kupfer and MHCRC colleagues expanded their original conclusion to view active medication as an effective means of preventing recurrence beyond three years. 
<P>
The results of these clinical trials conducted under the auspices of the MHCRC support the contention that patients with prior episodes of depression less than two and one-half years apart merit continued prophylaxis for at least five years.

<P>
Adam "was a wonderfully, sweet young man," his mother said. He
was a high school athlete and captain of his team, active in his
college fraternity, a good student.
<P>
He had graduated from college and started working while studying
for a professional certification exam when something inside him
changed. . . Adam stopped being careful about his personal
appearance.
<P>
He told his parents he suspected them of communicating with each
other in secret ways, such as in sign language which he couldn't
understand. He began to hear his mother's voice in his head and
he asked her why she was sending him messages. . . he was
diagnosed with schizophrenia.
<P>
What is schizophrenia?
<P>
Schizophrenia, a disease of the brain, is one of the most
disabling and emotionally devastating illnesses known to man. 
<P>
But because it has been misunderstood for so long, it has
received relatively little attention and its victims have been
undeservingly stigmatized.
<P>
Schizophrenia is not a split personality, a rare and very
different disorder.
<P>
Like cancer and diabetes, schizophrenia has a biological basis;
it is not caused by bad parenting or personal weakness. Nor are
individuals being treated for schizophrenia more prone to
violence than the general public, despite media focus on
exceptions.
<P>
Schizophrenia is, in fact, a relatively common disease, with an
estimated one percent of the U.S. population being diagnosed with
it over the course of their lives. While there is no known cure
for schizophrenia, it is a very treatable disease.
<P>
Most of those afflicted by schizophrenia respond to drug therapy,
and many are able to lead productive and fulfilling lives.
<P>
What are its symptoms?
<P>
Schizophrenia is characterized by a constellation of distinctive
and predictable symptoms. The symptoms that are most commonly
associated with the disease are called positive symptoms, that
denote the presence of grossly abnormal behavior. These include
thought disorder, delusions, and hallucinations.
<P>
Thought disorder is the diminished ability to think clearly and
logically. Often it is manifested by disconnected and nonsensical
language that renders the person with schizophrenia incapable of
participating in conversation, contributing to his alienation
from his family, friends, and society.
<P>
Delusions are common among individuals with schizophrenia. An
affected person may believe that he is being conspired against
(called "paranoid delusion"). "Broadcasting" describes a type of
delusion in which the individual with this illness believes that
his thoughts can be heard by others.
<P>
Hallucinations can be heard, seen, or even felt; most often they
take the form of voices heard only by the afflicted person. Such
voices may describe the person's actions, warn him of danger or
tell him what to do. At times the individual may hear several
voices carrying on a conversation.
<P>
Less obvious than the "positive symptoms" but equally serious are
the deficit or negative symptoms that represent the absence of
normal behavior. These include flat or blunted affect (i.e. lack
of emotional expression), apathy, and social withdrawal).
<P>
Who gets it?
<P>
While schizophrenia can affect anyone at any point in life, it is
somewhat more common in those persons who are genetically
predisposed to the disease. The first psychotic episode generally
occurs in late adolescence or early adulthood.
<P>
Genetic Link
<P>
<UL>
<LI>-- The probability of developing schizophrenia as the offspring of two parents, neither of whom has the disease, is 1 percent.
<LI>--  The probability of developing schizophrenia as the offspring of one parent with the disease is approximately 13 percent.
<LI>--  The probability of developing schizophrenia as the offspring of both parents with the disease is approximately 35 percent.
</UL>

<P>
Onset by Age
<P>
<UL>
<LI>--  Three-quarters of persons with schizophrenia develop the disease between 16 and 25 years of age.
<LI>--  Onset is uncommon after age 30, and rare after age 40.
</UL>

<P>
Onset by Sex
<P>
<UL>
<LI>--  In the 16-25 year old age group, schizophrenia affects more men than women.
<LI>--  In the 25-30 year old group, the incidence is higher in women than in men.
</UL>

<P>
What is the course of the disease?
<P>
Studies have shown that some persons with schizophrenia recover
completely, and many others improve to the point where they can
live independently, often with the maintenance of drug therapy.
Fortunately, this accounts for the majority of cases.
<P>
However, approximately 15 percent of people with schizophrenia
respond only moderately to medication and require extensive
support throughout their lives, while another 15 percent simply
do not respond to existing treatment. New therapies may offer
hope for the treatment of these most seriously affected
sufferers.
<P>
How is it treated?
<P>
Hospitalization is often necessary in cases of acute
schizophrenia. This ensures the safety of the affected person,
while allowing for observation by trained mental health
professionals to determine whether schizophrenia is the
appropriate diagnosis. Hospitalization also allows for the
initiation of medication under close supervision.
<P>
Antipsychotic drugs (also called neuroleptics), available since
the 1950s, can dramatically improve the functioning of people
with schizophrenia.
<P>
Once the most troubling symptoms are controlled by medication,
the person often does not require hospitalization.
<P>
Depending on the seriousness of the disease, the person may
utilize day programs, rehabilitation facilities, and be treated
in an outpatient setting. This allows the psychiatrist to adjust
medication dosages as necessary over the course of the disease.
<P>
The person may also need assistance in readjusting to society
once his or her symptoms are controlled.
<P>
Supportive counseling or psychotherapy may be appropriate for
these individuals as a source of friendship, encouragement, and
practical advice during this process. Relatives and friends can
also assist in rebuilding the person's social skills. Such
support is very important.
<P>
What can/should I do if a loved one is sick?
<P>
Because an individual with schizophrenia may not be aware that he
is ill, it is often necessary for a friend or relative to make
certain that proper treatment is sought.
<P>
A good doctor is critical; it helps to find one through the
recommendation of other families or healthcare professionals.
Once the person is released from the hospital, families are often
left with the responsibility of ensuring that the person is
taking medication and is continuing to receive whatever other
treatment is necessary.
<P>
The best way to treat a friend or relative with schizophrenia is
with compassion, understanding, and support. The person should
not be made to feel as if the disease is his or anybody's fault. 
<P>
As Dr. E. Fuller Torrey has stated, "People do not cause
schizophrenia; they merely blame each other for doing so." (See
footnote.) Learning about the disease and its treatment will help
to avoid the temptation to blame.
<P>
In addition to seeking help for the person afflicted with the
disease, loved ones often find mutual support to be invaluable.

grassroots, self-help organization of families and friends of

<H2>The Domenici-Wellstone Law (P.L. 104-204)</H2>
<H4>by Robert Bohlman, NAMI Director of Government Relations</H4>
</font>
<hr>


	The Domenici-Wellstone amendment was scaled back to require 
parity for only lifetime and annual dollar limits, and it has major 
exemptions.  The senators were forced to make these adjustments to 
secure agreement for passage.  The final conditions and exceptions 
are discussed here with a firm belief that its passage will help 
families all over the U.S.  It does require compliance by self-
insured employers, historically exempt from state mandates because 
of ERISA.  Now that it's enacted, it will need to be defended, 
monitored, and renewed.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">When is the law effective?</font>
<P>
It doesn't take effect until January 1, 1998, and it expires 
September 30, 2001.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">How does the law affect state parity laws and other mental health 
mandates?</font>
<P>
The state parity laws NAMI has worked to enact are not pre-empted 
by this federal law.  The conference report statement on the final 
bill says:
<P>
<I>	"It is the intent of the conferees that, consistent with 
section 704 (redesignated as section 731) of ERISA and 
Section 2723 of the Public Health Service Act, the 
application of the preemption provision should permit 
the operation of any State law or provision which 
requires more favorable treatment of mental health 
benefits under health insurance coverage than that 
required under this section."
</I><P>

It remains important to enact state parity laws, both to give 
relief to consumers and families on those issues this law does not 
cover and to build momentum and pressure for its reauthorization 
and improvement.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">What about the small-business exemption?</font>
<P>
Because of the "50 or fewer employees" exemption, it has been 
estimated that 40 to 50 million Americans will go without the 
improved coverage the bill requires.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">What about the purchaser being allowed to drop coverage for mental 
illness?</font>
<P>
The first decision a plan purchaser has is whether to drop mental 
health coverage to get out of complying or to retain mental health 
coverage and comply.  There is a question, with a special dynamic 
in union-contract situations, about whether many of the purchasers 
would comply anyway because of workforce loyalty/turnover 
considerations.  (This situation could also apply to businesses in 
the exempt "50 employees or fewer" category.)
<P>
If a purchaser/plan keeps mental illness coverage or starts it for 
the first time, this purchaser/plan is obligated to comply with the 
parity law for lifetime and annual limits.  It can offset any 
additional expense by re-balancing its plan and its cost-sharing 
with group members in several ways.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">What about the plan/purchaser flexibility to alter services and co-
insurance?</font>
<P>
The application of this flexibility could be a two-edged sword for 
NAMI consumers and families.  Adjusting limits on mental illness 
in-patient days or out-patient visits, raising mental illness co-
insurance and deductibles, and modifying the definition of medical 
necessity--or some combination of these--could keep the cost 
increase below one percent and thereby keep the company from 
becoming exempt.  BUT if such changes raise cost barriers 
inordinately, they impede access.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">What about making businesses exempt if the premium rises one 
percent or more?</font>
<P>
The second step for a purchaser keeping mental illness coverage is 
to determine the cost of the addition of annual and lifetime dollar 
parity.  If it reaches or exceeds one percent, the plan is again 
exempt.  But, it is hard to see how it would exceed one percent if 
the plan makes a good-faith effort to use the many cost-limiting 
mechanisms available under the amendment.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">So what will be the net positive effect?</font>
<P>
At the end of the day, we expect purchasers whose plans cover 
larger numbers of lives (though we don't yet know how to define 
"larger") to continue the coverage they already have and to 
institute the equalization of lifetime dollar limits and eliminate 
annual dollar limits.  (Because more than 95 percent of plans have 
no annual limits for other diagnoses, there's nothing to equalize, 
so equalization means elimination).
<P>
In the end, plans will bear a greater share of catastrophic 
treatment costs and families and consumers will bear a lesser 
share.  Nonetheless, there is still the possibility that the 
consumer and family share could be prohibitive because of all the 
mechanisms available to the plan purchaser to limit its costs.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">What does NAMI think about the one percent limit that can exempt 
businesses?</font>
<P>
The Congressional Budget Office estimate for the annual and 
lifetime caps amendment projects 0.4 percent as the increase in 
premium.  Senator Domenici believes that persons with severe and 
persistent mental illness will be the principal beneficiaries of 
the provision because only they hit the $50,000 (average) lifetime 
limit in current health plans.
<P>
NAMI agrees that only persons with severe illness will exceed the 
lifetime limits, and persons with severe illness are not a large 
percentage of the insured population.  NAMI has consistently stood 
by the incidence and prevalence data on severe illness from the 
National Institute for Mental Health: 2.8 percent of adults, or 
five million persons; and three percent of children, or seven 
million persons.  Many of these people are not covered by private-
sector plans now.  Disabled by the illnesses, they have fallen into 
the public sector.
<P>
The persons with severe illness who are covered in the private 
sector will not all have severe episodes in the same plan year, but 
they are the ones who would reach a lifetime cap.  They represent 
0.2 percent or less of the cases in recent private-sector analyses 
of millions of covered lives over several years.  They are both the 
ones who will raise the costs of premiums by very little and the 
ones who will benefit a lot.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">What about a concrete example?</font>
<P>
If a psychotic break in late adolescence were to incur a 
hospitalization expense of $30,000: 
<ul>
<li>	under the current employment-related plan with a $350 
family deductible with an 80/20 coinsurance and a $2,000 
annual limit on mental health services, the family pays 
all costs over $2,000, or $28,000.  
<li> under the new law (01/01/98) in the same circumstance, 
if the employer raised the deductible on mental illness 
services to $1,000 and lowered the co-insurance to 
50/50, the plan would pay $14,000 and the family would 
pay $16,000 ($12,000 less than they pay in the first 
scenario).
 </ul>

<A NAME = "highe"><H2>HIGHER RATES OF DEPRESSION IN WOMEN</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
Higher rates of depression observed in women may be linked to differences in biochemistry and childhood socialization that render some women more vulnerable than men to the illness, according to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).  The NIMH study and other research was reported in a special November 1993 issue of the Journal of Affective Disorders devoted to women and depression.
<P>
"Research into the biological and psychological underpinnings of depression is beginning to yield findings that help to explain why women are twice as likely to develop depression," said former NIMH Director Frederick K. Goodwin, M.D.  "As we learn more about gender-specific factors in the development of depression, we will be better able to design specialized and more effective treatments for both women and men with the disorder.
<P>
Findings reported in this issue of the Journal of Affective Disorders are reported below.
<P>
Dr. Myrna M. Weissman of Columbia University's New York State Psychiatric Institute and colleagues examined sex differences in the rates of depressive illnesses in the United States, Canada, Germany, and New Zealand. 
<P>
Across the four countries, they found almost the same rates of bipolar (manic-depressive) disorder in men and women, but higher rates of major depression and dysthymia in women.  Major depression first strikes in the mid- to late-20s for both sexes, and while the rate of depression in the United States in men born since 1945 has been rising, it appears to have stabilized in women.
<P>
In research on biological mechanisms underlying depression, Dr. Uriel Halbreich and Lucille A. Lumley, M.S., both of the State University of New York at Buffalo, compared neurochemical and neuroendocrine function in men and women. 
<P>
They found gender differences in several functions of the norepinephrine and serotonin neurotransmitter systems, in activities of dopamine and acetylcholine, and in certain operations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system. 
<P>
These findings suggest that vulnerability to depression, as well as its actual expression, might be related to short- and long-term effects of gonadal hormones.  These hormones probably play an important role in the multi-faceted and multi-dimensional mechanisms underlying mood and behavior.
<P>
Dr. Diane N. Ruble of the New York University and colleagues, in a literature review of socialization processes in childhood, discussed various social factors that may lead to girls' greater vulnerability to depression.  For example, girls are usually more closely watched and protected than boys, making them less likely to develop an independent sense of mastery. 
<P>
This low sense of self-efficacy, the researchers reported, may lead to feelings of little control, pessimism, and hopelessness.  Theorists of learned helplessness believe all of these are related to the development of depression.  This review also suggested that pre-pubertal girls sometimes have more depressive symptoms than boys. 
<P>
This finding supports the view that women's higher rates of depression cannot be solely explained by hormone-related changes associated with the onset of puberty.  This is important because it suggests that prevention and intervention efforts should be directed at socialization processes during the early school years.
<P>
Dr. Ronald Kessler of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and colleagues reported that there is no difference between the sexes in the overall course of depression once it occurs.  Men and women who had a history of depression were equally likely to have been chronically depressed or to have experienced an acute recurrence of a depressive episode in the past year. 
<P>
This finding comes from the National Comorbidity Survey, which was conducted in the United States from 1990 to 1992 and involved nearly 8,100 respondents.
<P>

<A NAME = "inade"><H2>INADEQUATE DEPRESSION TREATMENT</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
A study of the recognition and treatment of depression has found that only 23 percent of depressed patients who could benefit from anti-depressants were receiving these medications and 39 percent of them were getting sub-therapeutic doses. 
<P>
Published in the May 1994 American Journal of Psychiatry, the study by Dr. Kenneth B. Wells of the RAND Corporation also found that patients of psychologists and allied mental health professionals were less likely to receive anti-depressants regardless of the severity of their illness.  Additionally, depressed patients in HMOs were twice as likely to receive fewer visits and to be treated with anti-anxiety medications instead of anti-depressants. 
<P>
These results reinforce previous research showing that insufficient numbers of depressed patients are receiving appropriate treatment and that clinicians often fail to provide the kinds of treatment indicated by efficacy studies.
<P>


<A NAME = "justb"><H2>JUST BETWEEN US</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
In this column, I'm going to tell you a story full of unnecessary suffering and grief.  It's been a nightmare to remember and to write about.
<P>
The problem is words. Incredible power is compressed into words. Too many words and notions applied to consumers are poisoned by prejudice.  Stigma insinuates such subtly degrading lies and masquerades in such seductively simple half-truths.
<P>
Wherever the truth about mental illness is more complex than the words regularly used to describe it, that's where consumers suffer helplessly and too often needlessly.  The suffering is because no one sees accurately what's really happening to us or is willing to work with us to stop the tragedies before they happen.  
<P>
The heart of my story is a friend, a friend from the knob country of the rural South, quiet, honest, hard-working, and for parts of his life caught in the iron grip of unreasoning terror.
<P>
He could be painfully shy, withdrawn.  Even those who loved him aren't sure just when he slipped silently into paranoia.  He never graduated from school.  He was too ill.  
<P>
In the grip of driving terror he believed he'd be killed if he didn't defend himself.  He lashed out in explosive violence and killed.  He was found not guilty by reason of insanity and was remanded to a forensics facility where he was treated successfully and released.
<P>
I met him on the bus.  He was lost.  It was a bitter winter and he was wearing a short-sleeved cotton shirt.  Miraculously, he let me give him my sweatshirt and welcomed me as friend. 
<P>
We met more on the phone than in person.  We saw each other regularly on the bus to the local mental health center.  The second time I saw him he told me his story.  He astounded me by his halting openness, his absolute honesty.  Simply, with no evasions, no excuses, he told his tale.  To share that took incredible courage.
<P>
Over time it was clear:  his meds just weren't working as well as they once had.  He was slipping away.  I asked if he'd told his therapist.  He had.  He did again.  He hoped to see a psychiatrist about a meds change.  The available appointment was just too far in the future.  His life was getting scary.
<P>
We urged him to visit emergency intake so he could perhaps access a psychiatrist without the endless wait.  Or, we thought, he'd end up admitted to our local state hospital where he'd been before.
<P>
The mental health center where he went for treatment relies more on counseling than on state-of-the-art meds work.  Come the annual budget crunch, the director is famous among consumers for cutting psychiatry hours rather than talk therapy.  Again my friend tried to schedule a meds visit, but all he could get was another therapy appointment in a few days.  He was deteriorating, becoming volatile and agitated.
<P>
A neighbor, concerned and frightened, took him the next morning to emergency intake.  All he got was words. 
<P>
Later, a family down the street found him wandering, disoriented, and called the police.  The police talked to the neighbor who'd taken him to the center that morning, then took him back to emergency intake.  The person who saw him apparently didn't assess the acuity of the situation, even though my friend's complete records were at the center, and they included details of the not-guilty-by-reason-of-insanity verdict.
<P>
Late that evening, after he left the center, the police arrested him for the death of his neighbor, the very person who had taken him to the center in the morning looking for help and care.
<P>
Headlines shrieked, "Mentally Ill Killer Let Loose in Suburban Neighborhood," "Psychotic Killer Strikes Again."
<P>
We saw him in jail awaiting trial.  He wasn't on medication.  He talked word salad.  He was clearly psychotic.
<P>
A mental health professional characterized my friend to the press as a treatment-resistant, uncooperative case.  No one questioned that description or the appropriateness or the effectiveness of the treatment he actually received from that mental health center.
<P>
He was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.  He has yet to receive effective medication or appropriate treatment, and he is too ill to avoid the predators inside the bars.
<P>
Our extremely conservative governor mentioned him as a killer who would be kept off our streets by the Republican initiative to build 27 new prisons.  The governor wants to "privatize," or sell, our state mental hospitals to pay for the 27 new prisons.  
<P>
What has this to do with words?  I'm desperate to know, Was all this suffering inevitable because my friend was treatment-resistant and uncooperative?  Or did the treatment system catastrophically fail my friend, his neighbor, and our community?  What about the right to timely, humane, effective care?
<P>

<H2>Does Depot Medication Improve Compliance?</H2></center>

 <HR>


	"One cause of the gap between the theoretical and actual effectiveness of neuroleptic medications in the treatment of schizophrenia is the persistently high rate of patient noncompliance," wrote Peter Weiden when reporting on a compliance research study in Psychiatric Services (October 1995).  "For example, our research group found that 74 percent of schizophrenic outpatients become noncompliant with their neuroleptic regiment within two years of discharge from the hospital."
<P>
	In a preliminary study of 93 neuroleptic-responsive inpatients to determine whether administering medication by the depot route rather than orally improves compliance with neuroleptic treatment after inpatients leave the hospital, Peter Weiden, M.D., et al found mixed results.  Inpatients converted to depot medication had significantly better compliance at one month postdischarge; however, the initial positive effect on compliance waned.  No significant differences in compliance were found between the oral and depot groups at six and 12 months postdischarge.
<P>
	Although Weiden and his colleagues concluded that "converting inpatients to depot therapy significantly improved short-term but not long-term medication compliance after discharge," they also concluded that depot treatment "can be used as a way to promote the transition to outpatient services."

<h4><font color="#000080">Risperidone Available in Oral Solution</font></h4>

<P>
	Risperidone (Risperdal) is now available in an oral solution 
form.  According to a February 1996 market-research study, 50 
percent of healthcare professionals at long-term care and 
psychiatric facilities have been crushing tablets to ease 
administration of this drug.  Risperdal is indicated for the 
management of psychotic disorders, including both the positive and 
negative symptoms of schizophrenia, schizo-affective disorder, and 
the psychotic features associated with bipolar disorder.

<h3><font color="#000080">Risperidone for Adolescent Aggression</font></h3>
<P>
In a case report, control of aggression was achieved with 
risperidone therapy in six patients, aged eight to 14 years.  All 
displayed aggressive behaviors that ranged from destructiveness to 
physical violence.  Risperidone therapy produced dosage-related 
side effects in all six patients, but extrapyramidal side effects 
(resembling Parkinson's disease) were avoided at dosages below 
3mg/day in adolescents and 2mg/day in children.

<H2>NAMI Reports Deep Flaws, Money Wasted in System

<STRONG>Advocacy Group Calls for Dismantling of Federal-State Vocational 
Rehabilitation System, Funding to be Redirected </STRONG>
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Arlington, VA, February 3, 1997</font> ---  The federal-state vocational rehabilitation system that 
supports the employment needs of people with severe mental illnesses is "an abject failure," 
according to a new report released today by the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI).  
The report identifies pervasive problems in the tax-supported system from outmoded practices 
and questionable expenditures to deplorable outcomes and resistance to implementing 
changes.
<P>
 <I>A Legacy of Failure: The Inability of the Federal-State Vocational Rehabilitation System to 
Serve People with Serious Mental Illnesses</I> details the results of NAMI's assessment of the overall 
effectiveness of state programs that spend approximately $490 million annually, 79 percent of 
which comes from federal funds. 
<P>
"Our study results confirm what we have long suspected," said Laurie M. Flynn, 
NAMI's executive director.  "This system is not only a waste of tax-payers' dollars, but it fails 
miserably at helping people with severe mental illnesses get back to work." 
<B>Major report findings include:
</B><P> 
<ul>
<li> <B>Administrative costs eat up nearly 50 percent of the system's funding,</B> with the remaining 
funds supporting direct services.  Further, vocational rehabilitation agencies are unable to 
estimate how many people will be served in a given year and at what cost.
<P> 
<li> <B>The system achieves dismal long-term outcomes</B> for those with severe mental illnesses, 
who are earning less eight years after their cases are "successfully closed" by state agencies 
than before receiving employment assistance.

<P>
<li> <B>Methods to support this population are grossly outmoded.</B>  Services are time limited so 
that once people obtain employment, the system provides no additional support.  This 
approach is entirely contrary to the realities of severe mental illnesses, which are known to 
be brain disorders that are episodic in nature and fluctuate in severity and impact over 
time. 
<P>
<li> <B> Incentives reward employment counselors on the easiest placements.</B>  Despite successive 
federal and regulatory attempts to focus the system on people with the most severe 
disabilities, state vocational rehabilitation agencies have done little to establish incentives 
for serving individuals with more complicated long-term needs. 
</ul><P>
	More than 85 percent of individuals with serious brain disorders in this country are 
unemployed.  NAMI's report lays out several alternative approaches for helping many of these 
people obtain and maintain employment.  NAMI estimates that between 62,000 and 90,000 
persons could be served if the $490 million combined federal and state funds for the vocational 
rehabilitation system were pulled and redirected into programs that have demonstrated the 
ability to produce results. "The current system blocks change and is beyond repair," Flynn 
said.  "We're recommending a major overhaul, not a band-aid fix."
<P>
The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) is the nation's largest grassroots 
organization dedicated to improving the lives of persons with severe mental illnesses, 
including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness), major depression, and 
anxiety disorders.  Based in Arlington, Virginia, NAMI's membership includes more than 
140,000 people with brain disorders and their families, and 1,100 state and local affiliates in all 
50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Canada.  NAMI's efforts focus on <B>support </B>
to persons with serious brain disorders and to their families, <B>advocacy</B> for nondiscriminatory 
and equitable federal and state policies, <B>research</B> into the causes, symptoms, and treatments for 
brain disorders, and <B>education</B> to eliminate the pervasive stigma toward severe mental 
illnesses.

<h4><font color="#000080">Facts on Tourette's Syndrome</font></h4>

<h4><font color="#000080"><b>Reviewed by Charles T. Gordon, III, M.D., assistant professor of 
psychiatry, University of Maryland School of Medicine.</b></font></h4>

<P>

Note:  Tourette's disorder, or Tourette's syndrome (TS) as it is 
frequently called, is a neurologic syndrome.  The essential feature 
of Tourette's is multiple tics that are sudden, rapid, recurrent, 
non-rhythmic, stereotypical, purposeless movements, or 
vocalizations.
<P>

<h4 align=center><font color="#000080"><b>What are the symptoms of Tourette's syndrome? </b></font></h4>
<ul>
<LI>Both multiple motor and one or more vocal tics are present at some time during the illness, although not necessarily 
simultaneously.

<LI>These symptoms occur many times a day nearly every day or intermittently throughout a span of more than one year.

<LI>There is significant impairment or marked distress in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

<LI>The onset occurs before the age of 18 
</ul>
<P>

Symptoms can disappear for weeks or months at a time, and the 
severity waxes and wanes.
<P>

<h4 align=center><font color="#000080"><b>What are the first tics that may be characteristic of TS?</b></font></h4>
	<P>

Usually, the facial tic, such as rapid blinking of the eyes or 
twitches of the mouth, may be the first indication a parent has 
that their child may have TS.  Involuntary sounds, such as throat 
clearing and sniffing or tics of the limbs may be an initial sign 
in other children.  
<P>

<h4 align=center><font color="#000080"><b>Are any other symptoms associated with Tourette's?</b></font></h4>
	<P>

Approximately 50 percent of patients meet criteria for attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and this may be the more 
impairing problem.  Approximately one-third of patients meet 
criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or have other 
forms of anxiety.  Learning disabilities are common as well as 
developmental stuttering.  Social discomfort, self-consciousness, 
and depressed mood frequently occur, especially as children reach 
adolescence.
<P>

<h4 align=center><font color="#000080"><b>What causes these symptoms?</b></font></h4>
	<P>

Although the cause has not been definitely established, there is 
considerable evidence that TS arises from abnormal metabolism of 
dopamine, a neurotransmitter.   Other neurotransmitters may be 
involved.
<P>

<h4 align=center><font color="#000080"><b>Can TS be inherited?</b></font></h4>
	<P>

Genetic studies indicate that TS is inherited as an dominant gene, 
but different family members may have dissimilar symptoms.  A 
parent has a 50 percent chance of passing the gene to one of his or 
her children.  The range of symptomatology varies from multiple, 
severe tics to very minor tics with varying degrees of attention 
deficit-disorder (ADD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder.
<P>

<h4 align=center><font color="#000080"><b>Are boys or girls more likely to have TS?</b></font></h4>
<P>

	The sex of the child can influence the expression of the TS 
gene.  Girls with the gene have a 70 percent chance of displaying 
symptoms, boys with the gene have a 99 percent chance of displaying 
symptoms.  The ratio of boys and girls with TS is 3:1.  
<P>

<h4 align=center><font color="#000080"><b>How is Tourette's syndrome diagnosed?</b></font></h4>
<P>
	No blood analysis, x-ray, or other medical test exists to 
identify TS. Diagnosis is made by observing the signs or symptoms 
as described above.  A doctor may wish to use a CAT scan, EEG, or 
other tests to rule out other disorders that could be confused with 
TS.  Some medications cause tics, so it is important to inform the 
professional doing the assessment of any prescribed, over-the-
counter, or street drugs to which the patient may have been 
exposed. 
<P>

<h4 align=center><font color="#000080"><b>What are the benefits of seeking early treatment of TS symptoms?</b></font></h4>
	<P>

When a child's behavior is viewed as disruptive, frightening, or 
bizarre by peers, family, teachers, or friends, it provokes 
ridicule and rejection.  Teachers and other children can feel 
threatened and exclude the child from activities or interpersonal 
relationships.  A child's socialization difficulties will increase 
as he reaches adolescence.  Therefore, it is very important for the 
child's self-esteem and emotional well-being that treatment be 
sought as early as possible.
<P>

<h4 align=center><font color="#000080"><b>What treatments are available for TS?</b></font></h4>
	<P>

Not everyone is disabled by his or her symptoms, so medication may 
not be necessary.  When symptoms interfere with functioning, 
medication can effectively improve attention span, decrease 
impulsivity, hyperactivity, tics, and obsessive-compulsive 
symptomatology.  Relaxation techniques and behavior therapy may 
also be useful for tics, ADD symptoms, and OCD symptoms.
<P>

<h4 align=center><font color="#000080"><b>How does TS affect the education of a child or adolescent with TS?</b></font></h4>
<P>
	TS alone does not affect the IQ of a child.  Many children who 
have TS, however, also have learning disabilities or attention 
deficits.  Frequently, therefore, special education may be needed 
for a child with TS.  Teachers should be given factual information 
about the disorder; and if learning difficulties appear, the child 
should be referred to the school system for assessment of other 
learning problems.
<P>

<h4 align=center><font color="#000080"><b>What is the course of TS?</b></font></h4>
<P>
	
Some people with TS show a marked improvement in their late teens 
or early twenties.  However, tics as well as ADD and OCD behavior 
may wax and wane over the course of the life span.
<P>
           
  	According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th Edition), or DSM-IV
  	This is a change from the former edition, DSM-III-R, that set maximum age of onset at 21 years of age.

<h3><font color="#000080">Lower Lithium Dosing for African-Americans</font></h3>
<P>
Recent reports have suggested that the red blood cell (RBS)/plasma 
lithium ratio is significantly higher in African-Americans than in 
Caucasians.  This clinical study was undertaken to evaluate the 
possibility that the higher ratio may be associated with more side 
effects.  Thirty-four physically healthy patients (12 African-
Americans, 22 Caucasians) who met the DSM-III R criteria for 
bipolar affective disorders were studied for RBC/plasma lithium 
ratio.  At each evaluation, plasma lithium levels were similar in 
the two groups; however the RBC lithium concentration averaged 60 
percent higher in the African-Americans.  The African-Americans had 
significantly higher scores on the General Side Effects Scale, 
particularly in fatigue, dizziness, loss of initiative, and urinary 
frequency.  To reduce the frequency of these side effects, the 
dosage and serum/plasma levels of lithium may need to be lower for 
African-American patients, however, more research should be done 
before making this assumption.

<h3><font color="#000080">What Makes Tics Tick?</font></h3>
<P>
	For the first time, scientists have a neurobiological 
explanation for the variation in severity of tics in Tourette's 
syndrome.  Researchers at NIMH have traced such symptom differences 
to "supersensitivity" of certain neurotransmitter receptors in the 
brain structure responsible for carrying out automatic behaviors.  
They suggest that this dysfunction may underlie the compulsion to 
act out the sudden movements and vocalizations that characterize 
Tourette's syndrome, which affects about 100,000 Americans with its 
full-blown form and up to 0.5 percent of the population with milder 
symptoms.  The researchers report their findings in the August 30th 
issue of Science.  
<P>
	See the factsheet on Tourette's syndrome in the October issue of the 
Advocate.

<h4><font color="#000080">How do medications work?</font></h4>


<P>
	By changing the medium, Peter Goyer, M.D., of the Veterans 
Administration Medical Center, has used PET to determine how 
certain medications work.  After introducing compounds that 
resemble medications and have a radioactive label, Dr. Goyer--one 
of the one or two psychiatrists in the country board-certified in 
nuclear medicine--has been able to view the medications being 
delivered to the receptors in the brain.  Researchers will be able 
to determine immediately which medications are being delivered to 
where they are needed and if the desired response is achieved.  
Great help is near.

<h4 >Update:  Campaign to End Discrimination</h4>
<BR>
<h4 ><font color="#000080"><b> It can't be done without you</b></font></h4>
<P>
<I>by Rona Purdy, campaign chair, and Mike Malloy, campaign projects director </I>
<P>
	The opportunity to effect change in the acceptance of brain 
disorders as physical illnesses has never been better.  Although we 
did not get passage of the Domenici-Wellstone amendment in the 
final version of the Kennedy-Kassebaum Health Care Reform Act, we 
did move the "needle" considerably in the minds of decision-makers. 
<P>
 The issue became one of blatant discrimination.  Policy makers can 
no longer continue to ignore us in the private healthcare system 
and treat us as second-class citizens in the public Medicaid system 
without risking being labeled discriminators.
<P>
Make brain disorders as acceptable as heart disease, cancer, and 
epilepsy.
<P>
	In the year ahead, there is opportunity to move our agenda in 
both private and public health care.  You MUST play a key role.
<P>
	NAMI's Campaign to End Discrimination plan for year two will 
require major efforts in the grassroots.  The opportunity to change 
the way brain disorders are discriminated against in both public 
and private health care will continue to be the major focus of the 
campaign.  Many states will introduce state parity bills.  We will 
all be paying close attention to the Medicaid changes during the 
November election. 
	<P>
To end discrimination we must work together to create a groundswell 
of public support for our issues.  We will not be truly successful 
until the public views severe brain disorders with the same 
compassion and knowledge as it views heart disease, cancer, 
epilepsy, and other physical disorders.  
<P>
	The building of an army to end discrimination requires people. 
 Every attempt must be made to enlist more supporters.  The number 
of people we say we represent matters.  Our current membership 
number is not yet large enough if we are to truly have an impact.
<P>
Here are four things <B>YOU</B> can do now to increase our numbers:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> Sign up your entire family in NAMI and your state organization. 
 Sign up your adult children, your brothers, sisters, grandparents, 
aunts, and uncles.  This is the easy part.  Our issue is a family 
issue.  Ending the stigma begins at home.
<P>


<LI> Next, sign up your friends and neighbors.  And ask your family 
members--the ones you just signed up--to do the same thing.  None 
of these people must have a brain disorder in their family--or must 
want to attend a support group--to join us.  All anyone has to do 
is be is a supporter of our mission.  These people probably already 
know that you or someone you love has a brain disorder.  By 
approaching them you are reinforcing your level of comfort with 
discussing brain disorders.  You are teaching them to look beyond 
the stigma and to accept and support brain disorders in the same 
way they would support heart disease, cancer, or Alzheimer's 
disease.  
	<P>
Many state organizations have dues for this type of membership.  We 
recommend that $25 be sent to NAMI, then NAMI will return $7 and 
the new member's name to the state organization. 
<P>


<LI> Then turn to your doctor, dentist, lawyer, accountant, and 
associates at work.  All of these people probably know that someone 
you love has a brain disorder.  Sign them up as members of your 
state organization and NAMI.
<P>


<LI> Reach out to the influential people in your community.  There 
are individuals and organizations in every community that care 
about people.  These are the community activists, religious-
community members and organizations, and members of local civic 
groups.  These people shape community opinions and attitudes--and 
too few understand brain disorders.  Campaign brochures and 
materials are available to you through your state campaign 
coordinator.  But "leafleting the world" at health fairs will have 
minimal impact on discrimination.  On the other hand, distributing 
campaign materials and discussing brain disorders one-to-one with 
your community's opinion leaders will make a difference.  
Presenting the science message as a program at one of their 
meetings is a good way to engage these groups--but sign them up as 
members.
</OL>
<P>
Here are three things <B>YOU</B> can do now to educate your community's 
opinion leaders:
<P>
<OL>
	<LI> Become part of the campaign in your state and community.  All 50 
states--and many communities--have appointed campaign coordinators. 
 Call your state office to get in touch with your coordinator.
<P>

	<LI> Work with your campaign coordinators to reach influential 
opinion leaders in your community.  Ask to speak at their meetings. 
 Use the campaign materials to present the reasons our brain 
disorders should be covered the same way as other brain disorders 
such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, or epilepsy.  A key message to 
deliver is that society pays and will continue to pay for these 
disorders one way or another, either by their taxes in Medicaid and 
Medicare payments or by giving us equal protection in private 
insurance.  Take along an open letter to your U.S. senators and 
representatives, your state senator and representatives, your 
governor, and the president.  Ask community leaders to sign them 
and include their affiliation.  Ask them to join us in our efforts 
to end this unfair discrimination--and to join as an associate 
member of NAMI and your state organization.  Signed letters with 
lots of signatures should then be copied and sent to all of the 
parties addressed and to NAMI's Campaign to End Discrimination.
<P>

	<LI>  Adopt a legislator.  Target a key legislator for whom you voted 
and take on the ongoing job of making him or her a "friend and 
ally."   Join NAMI for this legislator, as a gift for him or her.  
Send this "friend and ally" frequent notes and information.
<P>

	<LI> Identify business leaders in your community.  Our loudest 
opponent in our efforts to end insurance discrimination for brain 
disorders has been the business community.  Business interests 
widely criticized our attempts to end insurance discrimination as 
being a broad mandate that would lead to skyrocketing costs.  The 
truth of the matter is that coverage of the severe brain disorders 
is not a broad mental health mandate and that numerous studies have 
shown that the cost of ending discrimination is minimal.  By 
identifying local business leaders now, you will be prepared to 
effectively use campaign materials with business groups.  These 
materials will be distributed to state campaign coordinators and 
state organizations in the coming months.
<P>


</OL>
Tell us what you've accomplished and receive a campaign lapel pin.
<P>
	When you've signed up your family, friends, neighbors, co-
workers, senators, representatives, and business acquaintances, 
write to us at the campaign and tell us what you have done.  When 
you have contacted your state and local campaign coordinator and 
worked to reach community opinion leaders, write to us.  Again, 
tell us what you have done.  We will send you a limited-edition 
campaign lapel pin.  Most important, though, you will have joined 
the Campaign to End Discrimination as a participant.

<h4 align=center><font color="#000080"><b>Clozapine and pregnancy:  one woman's decision
by Martha Lautenbach Wolff</b></font></h4>

<P>
Note:  This is an individual account of the author's individual 
experience.  NAMI neither agrees nor disagrees with the author's 
decisions.
<P>
	Ten months ago I gave birth to a healthy baby boy.  I had been 
taking 200 milligrams of clozapine (Clozaril) daily for the 
previous six years.  I was worried--and so were my doctors--about 
how the medication might affect my baby and how not taking the 
medicine might affect my functioning as a pregnant woman.
	<P>
There are so many factors and considerations to take into account 
when deciding whether or not to have a baby.  Add to that having a 
condition that necessitates taking clozapine, and the decision 
becomes confusing and truly overwhelming.  In the end the decision 
is completely personal, but in this article I will share with you 
the information that I have compiled over the course of several 
years concerning becoming pregnant on clozapine.  One note, 
however:  the information I share in this article is only about 
clozapine, which is an atypical drug in its class.  It does not 
pertain to other anti-psychotic drugs.
	<P>
Before trying clozapine, I had struggled with depression for many 
years, and I finally entered a hospital.  I spent two and one-half 
harrowing years there trying every drug for what by that time was 
diagnosed as a schizo-affective disorder.  Nothing worked.
<P>
	With the help of my mother, I was able to be the first person 
to try clozapine at the New York Hospital/Cornell Medical Center.  
Within about three months I was able to leave the hospital and 
function on my own.  The next five years would be a difficult 
process of getting my life back together with day hospital, school, 
and finding a job.  I met the man I would marry and--after a two-
year engagement--we were married.  I was thrilled to be able to 
continue my life in a normal, healthy way.  Having a baby was 
always part of my dream, but I didn't know if it would be possible 
on clozapine.  So, after nearly seven years of taking clozapine, I 
started researching and trying to decide.
	<P>
Because clozapine is a relatively new drug in the United States, 
there have been very few studies on pregnant women taking the drug. 
 Advice from psychiatrists was almost uniformly the same:  "Don't 
take clozapine while pregnant!  Not enough is known about the 
effects of the drug on the fetus."  One doctor advised cutting the 
dose of clozapine to a minimum during the first three months of 
pregnancy, which is the crucial time for fetal development.  
Although I did receive advice, I felt I was alone in the making of 
this decision.  I was venturing into the unknown.
	<P>
In an article titled "Psychotropic Drugs in Pregnancy and 
Lactation," authors Harold Goldberg, M.D., and Robyn Nissim, B.A., 
suggest that studies prove that the fetus is at greatest risk of 
negative effects from clozapine during the first three months of 
gestation, when organs are beginning to develop.  Clozapine is a 
"category B" drug, which means that in animal studies there were no 
adverse effects on the fetus--but there are no extensive controlled 
studies in pregnant women.  Clozapine, however, does cross the 
placenta to some extent, and the fetus absorbs more of the drug 
than the mother.  For this reason, the mother may have to increase 
her dosage of the drug to maintain its effectiveness in controlling 
the symptoms for which it was prescribed.
	<P>
The fetus and the mother exist in equilibrium, and this can pose 
problems right before and during birth.  According to Goldberg and 
Nissim, if clozapine is concentrated in the fetus right before 
birth, the baby will go through withdrawal after birth, and the 
effect could be toxic.  One possible reaction could be a sedation 
effect known as "floppy baby syndrome," which disappears as the 
clozapine metabolizes or passes through the system.  Some of the 
symptoms of this syndrome include hyperactivity, tremors, motor 
restlessness, and abnormal movements that could last for several 
months, but eventually subside.  These symptoms seem to be due to 
the baby's immature metabolism.  The authors state that there are 
two schools of thought about how to best protect a baby from the 
effects of withdrawal (even though their conclusions are 
inconclusive due to lack of studies).  The authors recommend 
discontinuing clozapine five to ten days before delivery to avoid 
the symptoms; other doctors think it is safer to let the baby 
withdraw after birth.
<P>
	I did not reduce my dosage of clozapine during my pregnancy.  
I had experimented with stopping the medication and reducing the 
dose.  I found that symptoms returned promptly and to such a degree 
of severity that reducing the dose while I was pregnant would have 
been unwise.  However, I did reduce by half the clozapine the night 
before I was scheduled to go into the hospital.  I started again 
the full dose the day after my son was born.  He did have some 
breathing difficulty, but it corrected itself quickly.  There was 
no evidence that this was a result of withdrawal.  He also did not 
exhibit any of the possible side effects such as motor 
restlessness.  
<P>
	The authors of the article mentioned above suggest that 
physicians (and patients) need to weigh controlling schizophrenia 
against the risk of the drug to the mother.
	<P>
I found several other studies done on women on clozapine who became 
pregnant.  The first appeared in the American Journal of Psychiatry 
in June 1994.  It reported on a woman with schizophrenia who had 
been in a five-year remission since taking clozapine.  In 
preparation for her pregnancy she stopped taking the drug, but was 
forced to resume taking it when her symptoms returned.  During the 
last nine weeks of her pregnancy, her medication was reduced.  She 
delivered normally, and they baby showed no adverse effects and had 
no psychomotor abnormalities at six months.  The conclusion was the 
recommendation to lower the dose of clozapine as much as possible a 
few days before birth to avoid "floppy baby syndrome."  Also, the 
authors recommend that mothers should not breastfeed their babies 
because clozapine does pass through into the infant in breast milk.
<P>
	The other study, in the January 1993 issue of the American 
Journal of Psychiatry, reported that--as of December 1990--14 women 
were known to be exposed to clozapine during their pregnancies with 
no adverse effects on the fetuses.
<P>
	The Clozaril information packet distributed by Sandoz, the 
manufacturer of the drug, backs up these findings.  Reproduction 
studies in rats and rabbits given 2.5 to 7.0 times the human dose 
showed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus.  
Sandoz recommends that clozapine should not be administered to 
pregnant women unless clearly needed.  Their reasons include: 1) 
adequate, well-controlled studies have not been performed; 2) 
animal studies are not always transferable to humans; and 3) it is 
advisable to minimize use of all drugs during pregnancy.  Sandoz 
also agrees with the recommendation to avoid breastfeeding while on 
clozapine.
	<P>
The University of Connecticut Health Center Pregnancy Exposure 
Information Service also found that clozapine did not affect 
genetic material in bacterial or mammalian test systems.  Again, 
they said that animal studies suggest that clozapine is not a cause 
of birth defects, but a small risk does exist--but a risk no 
greater that for the general population.  Also mentioned is the 
possible agranulocytosis, which is a toxic effect on bone marrow.  
It can be fatal if not caught and reversed early enough.  It is not 
clear if this problem could occur in the fetus or newborn.  
	<P>
And there is a risk of seizures, but there is little data on 
whether the fetus or newborn might be affected, according to the 
December 1990 issue of the International Drug Therapy Newsletter.
<P>
	Some doctors warn that if you are on clozapine, you have a 
severe illness and, therefore, they don't recommend pregnancy.  
There is a potential risk of passing it on to your children.  Also, 
doctors are concerned with the parenting skills--or lack of them--
in people with serious brain disorders.
<P>
	In conclusion, this decision about pregnancy is completely 
personal.  As scared as I was, I felt there was enough positive 
research and very little negative.  I believed I could handle being 
a parent because, on the medication, I was well enough for long 
enough.  I decided that life has risks at all times, and I really 
wanted to bring a baby into this world.  I ventured into the 
unknown, but life itself is the great unknown.  
	<P>
And I hope that, with what I have written, the unknown is a little 
more known.

<h4><font color="#000080">Historic Step Toward Ending Discrimination</font></h4>
<P>
	The House-Senate conference committee approved the outlines of 
a spending bill that includes a landmark provision requiring 
insurance plans providing mental health benefits to set the same 
level of yearly and lifetime coverage for these benefits as for 
other medical services.  The bill is poised to become law in the 
next two weeks. (We went to press the week of September 23.)  The 
continuous and ardent advocacy of NAMI members made this historic 
achievement possible.
	<P>
"This has been a very long and difficult effort, but I'm pleased 
that we have finally succeeded," Senator Domenici (R-NM) said 
today.  "I am proud of the fact that my mental health parity 
amendment was accepted.  This represents a first step by the 
Congress to bring the nation to terms with caring for the millions 
of Americans who suffer from these diseases of the brain."  
Continued Domenici, "With this we begin remedying one of the most 
glaring and discriminatory discrepancies prevalent in America 
today."
<P>	
Co-sponsor of the bill, Senator Paul Wellstone (D-MN) said "This is 
a huge victory.  It is a crucial and affordable step toward ending 
the stigma and the most egregious form of discrimination against 
Americans suffering from mental illness.  Millions of American 
families will benefit from this very significant move toward parity 
treatment for people with mental illnesses."  
	<P>
The bill, which is scheduled for approval by the House and Senate 
in the next few days (the last week in September) and then to be 
sent to the president, would outlaw discriminatory annual and 
lifetime limits on mental illness treatment in insurance plans 
offering mental health coverage.  It extends to employers with more 
than 50 employees.  Implementation is set for January 1998.  The 
Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan is also covered under the 
bill.  The provision "sunsets" in five years.  
	<P>
The need for the amendment originated in the grassroots, and the 
people's voice--NAMI's voice--fueled the provision's momentum.  On 
September 5, the Senate voted overwhelmingly 82 to 15 for the 
Domenici-Wellstone amendment.  President Clinton expressed strong 
support for the amendment to House Speaker Newt Gingrich in a 
letter delivered the morning of September 11th.  President Clinton 
wrote:  "People with mental illness have faced discrimination in 
health insurance coverage for too long....It is time that we take 
steps to end this inequity."  The House voted that same day 392 to 
17 to instruct VA/HUD appropriations conferees to include the 
Domenici-Wellstone amendment as part of the proposed bill.  On 
September 19th, the conferees did just that, voting to include this 
parity amendment.
	<P>
There can be no doubt that strong grassroots advocacy, week after 
week, registered with federal lawmakers.  You, the members of NAMI, 
performed heroically and deserve immense gratitude and 
congratulations.  But our fight has just begun.  "This legislation 
is vital to stopping rampant discrimination against people with 
severe mental illness," said Laurie Flynn, executive director of 
NAMI.  "This decision by the conferees is just the beginning of 
ending insurance discrimination.  Congress has sent a strong 
message to employers and insurance companies that the days of 
second-class treatment of people with brain disorders are 
numbered."  Annie Saylor, the President of NAMI, echoes this 
remark:  "An important first step has been achieved toward ending 
discrimination against people with brain disorders called mental 
illnesses.  We must not give up until ALL such discrimination has 
ended."

<h3><font color="#000080">Schizophrenia Treatment</font></h3>
<P>
	Evidence has recently linked a important neurotransmitter, 
glutamate, to the underlying pathology of schizophrenia--and that 
opens a new line of attack on the limitations of current 
treatments.  Donald Goff and colleagues at the Massachusetts 
General Hospital have demonstrated that an agent, d-cycloserine, 
acting at a specific nerve-cell receptor site for glutamate, 
substantially improves negative symptoms and cognitive functioning 
when added to conventional antipsychotic agents.  The researchers, 
with NIMH funding, are preparing to pursue this finding in an 
extended clinical trial.

<h3><font color="#000080">Federal Entitlement Programs That Affect Persons With Serious Brain Disorders</font></h3>

 
<H4>ENTITLEMENT REVIEW </H4><BR>
<H4>November, 1996 </H4>
 
 <P>
Federal entitlements are critically important to disabled individuals with serious brain disorders and their families.  They stand as 
the most important federal programs that provide individuals with severely disabling illnesses with a modest income and that 
provide access to necessary treatment and services. 
 
<P>  
The importance of these programs is underscored by statements of the NAMI membership and Board.  NAMI policy says that <B><I>reform 
should not result in less for beneficiaries than they have under current law</I></B>.  At the 1994 NAMI convention in San Antonio, 
membership brought forth a resolution demanding that staff make it a priority to advocate for increases in SSI (that were identified 
in the 20th anniversary review of SSI conducted under Social Security Administration Commissioner King).  Specifically, members 
wanted the dollar-for-dollar grant offset that begins after the first $65 of earnings repealed. 
<P> 
Precisely because of their vital importance, federal entitlements demand our continued examination.  As currently constructed, these 
federal programs do not meet the needs of all individuals disabled by serious brain disorders-they provide strong disincentives to 
work, even during periods when work is possible and desirable by the consumer.  Federal entitlements, for too many people, are a 
barrier to optimal recovery. 
<P> 
Nor do the federal entitlement programs cover all necessary services.  Some contain several discriminatory limits specifically on 
individuals with serious brain disorders.  And the complexities of the entitlement programs, especially Medicaid, are such that any 
suggested changes for federal policy must be carefully considered.  The complexities of the programs and their interaction are 
significant parts of the problem.  NAMI, of course, can never tolerate discrimination against people with serious brain disorders and 
their families especially if written into federal law. 
 <P>
NAMI cannot, however, afford to ignore the pressures on the federal entitlement programs.  There will be continued clamor for 
federal legislators to control the growth in these entitlements or to cut them, due to their staggering outyear growth projections and 
the effect these have on the federal deficit and crowding out of discretionary programs.  NAMI must advance the cause of people 
with serious brain disorders and their family members-hopefully in a constructive manner but in a strong defensive manner if 
necessary. 
 <P>
Caution should be the byword for our examination.  As noted, federal entitlement programs are a lifeline for many individuals with 
serious brain disorders. 
 <P>
Federal entitlements that historically are of the greatest utility to persons with brain disorders are of two kinds: insured and means-
tested.  Within each type there is an income maintenance program and a health insurance program.  The insured entitlements are 
Social Security Disability Insurance and Medicare.  The means-tested entitlements are Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid. 
 <P>
<H4>Insured Entitlements </H4>
 <P>
<U>Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)</U> guarantees a continuing income stream to a worker who becomes disabled after sufficient 
covered quarters (minimum six) of work to qualify under Title II of the Social Security Act.  In certain circumstances a child of a 
disabled or deceased worker who becomes disabled before age 22 can receive SSDI on the parent's work record rather than on their 
own. 
 <P>
The average monthly payment in 1993 was just under $650/month.  In 1992 the federal government paid out $31.091 billion in 
SSDI benefits (up from $18.836 billion in 1985). 
 <P>
While there is no means test going in (because disability supposes current inability to work full time), there is a limit on earnings 
(currently $500) through substantial gainful activity coming out.  A person with large unearned income, and or substantial assets is 
still eligible for SSDI.  But a person who works just over half-time under the minimum wage jeopardizes continuation of his/her 
SSDI monthly check. 
<P> 
<U>Medicare</U> enrollment is automatically granted to a person under 65 years old whose disability and connection to covered work 
qualifies them for SSDI.  But there is a two year waiting period.  The underlying purpose is to observe whether the disability is 
permanent.  Medicare Part A is the hospital insurance, and is non-contributory with respect to premium.  Medicare Part B is 
Physician and other out-patient service insurance.  It requires exercising an option to participate at all and payment of a monthly 
premium, currently $42.50.  
 <P>
Medicare, while it does not cover prescription meds, does (Part B) cover physician visits at 80%, and covers partial hospitalization.  
Additionally, many disabled persons enrolled on Medicare are poor enough that they are also eligible for Medicaid.  When Medicaid 
enrolled, their Part B premiums, and all deductibles and co-pays can be picked up by Medicaid (when no other third-party plan is 
obligated for first dollar coverage).  This dual eligible status brings participants better health plan coverage than all but a few plans 
in the private sector. 
 <P>
Medicare retains discriminatory limits on certain treatments for mental disorders.  Hospital days are limited to 190 lifetime.  This is 
not true for other diagnoses.  Whereas outpatient co-insurance for all other services is 20% patient/80% plan, outpatient psychiatric 
services are @ 50% patient/50% plan.  Ways & Means and Senate Labor made significant improvements in these discriminatory 
features of Medicare in the 103rd Congress, but the amendments never came to a floor vote in either chamber. 
 <P>
<H4>Means-tested Entitlements</H4> 
 <P>
Whereas the insured entitlements are linked to "premiums" paid into trust funds via employer and employee payroll taxes, the 
means-tested entitlements are public assistance programs available only to persons who meet the social characteristics for the 
programs -- and whose income, and assets -- each strictly defined in law and regulation -- are below the eligibility cut-off points. 
  <P>
<U>Supplemental Security Income (SSI)</U> is a national income maintenance program for the poor elderly, blind, or disabled.  No state 
may set an eligibility threshold lower than the national, unlike the former AFDC, now TANF program.  It was assumed when the 
SSI program was enacted that the elderly poor would be the principal beneficiaries.  But in 1993 83% of the total federal payments 
went to all persons with disabilities, not just those disabled by brain disorders.  The amount paid to disabled recipients was $1.470 
billion. 
 <P>
The disability determination process in adults is virtually identical to that for SSDI.  (The Social Security Administration is about to 
field test a "re-engineered" eligibility determination system.)  A national income floor is established at about 68% of poverty.  The 
current monthly grant is $470.  When a person attempts to work full time, after the first $65 ($85 if they have no unearned income at 
all) of earnings their grant is offset one dollar for every two earned.  They can control their hours or refuse raises to keep their 
earnings below the SSI vanishing point.  They can thereby maintain a $1. grant, and thereby keep the categorical link to Medicaid 
eligibility. 
 <P>
<U>Section 1619 of SSI</U> can also be utilized.  This provision permits recipients in any state to maintain Medicaid eligibility to a higher 
income level when they no longer receive any SSI grant, even the dollar.  It requires 1) that the disability eligibility condition for SSI 
is still current, though the income and assets conditions are no longer met because of higher earnings; and, 2) that Medicaid services 
are necessary on an on-going basis as a pre-condition of maintaining the person in a health condition that enables him/her to work. 
 <P>
SSI for children is changed by the enactment of the Welfare Reform bill.  "individual functional assessments" are no longer allowed 
as a tool for determining eligibility.  Children must meet a listed disorder, and have a "marked and severe" functional impairment.  
The Administration reports that half of the children put off SSI, or not able to get on, will still qualify for Medicaid under another 
eligibility avenue (below the poverty level, for instance). 
 <P>
Adults who qualified for SSI with a "material" contribution from an addictive disorder are put off the rolls January 1.  The debt 
ceiling bill contained this provision.  SSA estimates that 80% may re-qualify by a clearer restatement of their underlying brain 
disorder as sufficient in and of itself -- without any material contribution by addictive disorder -- to certify them as disabled under 
the SSA definitions and procedures.  Persons functionally impaired with cognitive deficits will need advocates to manage and assist 
in their reapplication. 
 <P>
SSI has a special relationship to housing for many adult recipients.  Congregate housing -- group homes for the disabled, with or 
without support services, often take the person's whole (or nearly whole) monthly SSI check in payment for meals and shelter. 
 <P>
<U>Medicaid</U> is automatically given to persons who are SSI enrolled in all but twelve states.  These states were grandfathered at the time 
of enactment, and are permitted to use their own more stringent definitions for income and asset thresholds, and for disability.  
Although a separate determination process is required in these "209b" states, we are not aware of rejections of SSI enrolled persons 
to any extent. 
 <P>
Medicaid pays for all diagnoses equally in the fee-for-service mode, so there is something akin to parity in the basic program.  The 
community services that have been piloted in the public sector have more often than not involved Medicaid funding.  Nearly forty 
states had included in their programs one or more of the optional services (services that do not have to be in a state's Medicaid plan 
for HCFA to certify its compliance) that help build a public sector community services network: the rehab option, the intense case 
management option, the clinic option, or the preferred provider option.  Medicaid pays for prescription meds (which it still classifies 
as an optional service, but all 50 states and the District cover it), and in most states new generation drugs are covered by the 
formulary. 
 <P>
Medicaid's shortcomings are the Institution for Mental Disease (IMD) exclusion, and the inequality of access to the home-and-
community-based waivers.  IMDs are inpatient facilities in which more than 50% of the census has a primary diagnosis of mental 
disease, less patients over 65 with Alzheimer's or other dementia.  Adults between the ages of 22 and 64 who are hospitalized in a 
facility characterized as an IMD cannot have their care paid for by Medicaid, even if they had Medicaid enrollment prior to 
admission.  Psychiatric wings of larger hospitals have their in-patient census averaged in with the entire facility's, with the effect that 
Medicaid does reimburse care there.  Scattered beds in acute, general care hospitals are also eligible for reimbursement.  Up to age 
22 and over age 65, there is no such exclusion. 
 <P>
Repeal of the IMD exclusion might not be an unmixed blessing.  When such language appeared in the first House version of 
Medicaid reform in 1994, the field feared that states would re-finance their old-line state mental hospitals with Medicaid if this went 
through. 
 <P>
Persons with mental retardation and developmental disabilities who were residing in state institutions were the primary beneficiaries 
of the home-and-community-based waivers created in OBRA 87 as sections 2175 and 2176 of that act.  They required that an 
institutional bed be closed as a community slot was opened, or that without community services the person would absolutely require 
an institutional bed.  Since deinstitutionalization for persons with brain disorders was mostly over by the time they were enacted, the 
slot tradeoff balance was not available. 
 <P>
Parity for mental illnes was attached to S 1795, the last Medicaid attempt of the past Congress, in the Senate Finance Committee 
through the Conrad amendment.  It covers amount, duration, and scope of services and co-pays.  It is problematic to predict its 
effects, since it doesn't repeal the IMD rule, nor does it make the optional services that constitute the community services network 
mandatory.  If it can pass the Senate Finance Committee again in the next Congress, there is still the question as to whether final 
enactment would follow. 
 <P>
<H4>Characteristics of the Income Maintenance Programs</H4> 
 <P>
Just over a quarter of all the enrolled persons in SSDI and SSI are disabled by a mental condition, not including retardation.  31.2% 
of SSI recipients (Dec, 1995) had a mental disorder as a primary disability diagnosis.  This represented 852,600 persons between the 
ages of 18 and 64, plus 210,100 children.  (A self-reported survey of a sample of the adults asserted that 43% lived below the poverty 
level.)  The SSDI numbers for the same period are 1,069,000 persons, 25.9% of the total SSDI enrollment. 
 <P>
<H4>The dilemma </H4>
 <P>
Consumers and families certainly desire that the federal entitlements worked in better harmony with the clinical course of the brain 
disorders and their unpredictable cycles.  But too much success at independence causes loss of Medicaid and of the stability and 
quality of life Medicaid can enable.  The same is roughly equivalent for Medicare.  So the very support that enables one to work is 
threatened when one works. 
 <P>
Private employer-sponsored health plans could fill the gap if they covered all needed services and supports.  But SSDI beneficiaries 
and Medicaid recipients typically would have the kind of job that would not have such a health plan at the time they hit the 
ineligibility "notch". 
 <P>
<UL>
<LI>SSDI only has a nine-month trial work period (plus 36 months of continued eligibility without any Social Security check for 
the final 33 months), and has a very low permissible earnings (SGA) limit: $500/month.  These features create very frightening 
disincentives for persons with severe brain disorders who are stabilized in the community and wish to work.  Medicare can continue, 
but Social Security checks not stopped in timely fashion by self-reporting of earnings over the limit will have to be repaid. 
<P>
<LI>SSI has the equivalent of a very high marginal tax rate, 50% (for every dollar earned $0.50 is deducted from the SSI grant).  
SSI's section 1619 extenders of eligibility when earnings rise are very little understood and hard to access.  These features create 
discouraging disincentives to persons with severe brain disorders who are stabilized in the community and wish to work.  Loss of SSI 
threatens loss of Medicaid.
</UL>

 <P>
Under these circumstances, for persons with severe brain disorders to reach for independence and self-fulfillment through greater 
earnings is like letting go of one swinging high trapeze bar to grab another -- without a net. 
 <P>
<H4>Proposed solution </H4>
 <P>
The "open file" solution has been proposed.  This mechanism would permit a disabled person in a period of stability to exceed the 
current fall-off thresholds.  But if their disorder, acknowledged as clinically unpredictable yet chronic, flared up and rendered them 
unable to continue work -- their active enrollment status would be reactivated without the need to reapply from scratch, and the 
attendant lengthy waiting periods without supports. 
 <P>
The former Ways & Means staffer who wrote section 1619 has been promoting versions of this solution for at least three congresses.  
There was no bill to this effect in the 104th.  When the Social Security Administration's Associate Commissioner for Disability was 
asked if the SSA would support such a notion, the response was negative.   
 <P>
<H4>Framework for legislative change </H4>
 <P>
Entitlement reform pressures that come from outyear cost growth forecasts are well known.  Former Senators Rudman and Tsongas 
are leaders of the Concord Coalition, one prominent movement to rein in entitlement growth.  Senators Nunn and Domenici did an 
across-the-aisle proposal in the just-ended Congress.  Senator Robert Kerrey (Nebraska), with former Senator John Danforth headed 
another such group, at the request of the President.  All of these bi-partisan efforts conclude that continuation of the status quo is 
under no circumstances a realistic option.  While the largest entitlements, driven principally by the demographics of an aging society 
that is simultaneously adding significantly to lifespan, are Social Security and Medicare -- Medicaid is not far behind. 
 <P>
The signing of the Welfare Reform bill and the number of votes it received from Democrats attest to the real political will to go 
beyond talk.  The population whose disability arises from a severe brain disorder is not the target of these forces, but is caught up in 
them.  The pre-conference House version of this bill contained a House provision creating a disability commission to look at all this.  
The House language did not survive the conference, and so is not in the law.  But the House interest and intent remains. 
 <P>
NAMI's position is clear: 
 <P>

<UL>
<B>Consumers need life options that aren't severely curtailed by safety net eligibility rules.  Consumers and families certainly 
believe that federal entitlements should work in better harmony with the clinical course of severe brain disorders. </B>
</UL>

 <P>
NAMI believes that these better life options include education, vocational and employment services, and employment -- and that 
participation in them for those who are able contributes to recovery and quality of life.  Underlying the freedom to explore such 
options is the necessity for stable access to adequate and appropriate treatment and supports, living arrangements, and other basic 
life necessities. 
 <P>
Once again, NAMI Board-passed public policy says that <B>reform should not result in less for beneficiaries than they have under 
current law</B>.  (This is stated in the context of Health Care Reform, but is deeply and strongly enough held that it can legitimately be 
extended to other support areas in the public safety net.)

<h3><font color="#000080">Bipolar Disorder in Children and Adolescents</font></h3>
<P>
	Although bipolar disorder is often unrecognized or 
misdiagnosed in children and adolescents, a recent study in 
Adolescence found that, when care was taken to conduct a thorough 
diagnostic interview, bipolar disorder was the most common problem 
diagnosed in adolescents referred to psychiatric inpatient units.

    depression.</p>
    <p><b>Antimanic:</b> Medication used to treat the manic
    episodes of bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness).</p>
    <p><b>Antipsychotic</b>: Medication used to treat psychosis
    -- for example, in schizophrenia.</p>
    <p><b>Bipolar Disorder</b>: A brain disorder characterized by
    manic and major depressive episodes, with periods of recovery
    generally separating the mood swings. Psychosis may be
    present during manic episodes. Bipolar disorder usually
    begins in the mid 20s and is chronic.</p>
    <p><b>Brain Disorder</b>: A severe mental illness, such as
    schizophrenia, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder,
    bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness), and major depression.</p>
    <p><b>Cerebral Cortex</b>: The portion of the brain that is
    critical in decisionmaking. Abnormalities in the cortex
    structure and functioning have been identified as likely
    causes of brain disorders.</p>
    <p><b>Dopamine</b>: A chemical messenger in the brain. This neurotransmitter
    appears to play some role in brain disorders such as
    schizophrenia.</p>
    <p><b>Hippocampus</b>: A nucleus in the brain crucial to
    learning and memory; part of the limbic system.</p>
    <p><b>Limbic System</b>: A network of structures in the brain
    associated with control of emotion and behavior --
    specifically, perception, motivation, gratification, memory,
    and thought. </p>
    <p><b>Locus Ceruleus</b>: A nucleus in the brain that is
    involved in, among other things, the body&#146;s response to
    stressful situations, such as the fight-or-flight response.</p>
    <p><b>Major Depression</b>: A brain disorder characterized by
    profound depression -- that is, loss of interest or pleasure
    in activities, sadness, and feelings of helplessness. Other common
    symptoms include weight gain or loss, insomnia or excessive
    sleepiness, slowed or agitated movement, intense feeling of
    guilt or worthlessness, diminished ability to concentrate,
    and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. Bouts of
    depression commonly recur. Psychosis may also accompany major
    depression. The typical age of onset is the late 20s.</p>
    <p><b>Mania</b>: A symptom of bipolar disorder characterized
    by irritability, expansiveness, elation, talkativeness,
    hyperactivity, and excitability.</p>
    <p><b>Monoamine</b>: A group of neurotransmitters (brain
    chemicals) -- namely norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine.</p>
    <p><b>Monoamine-Oxidase Inhibitor (MAO)</b>: A class of antidepressants
    that acts by prolonging monoamine activity; generally used to
    treat persons who do not respond to tricyclic antidepressants.</p>
    <p><b>Norepinephrine</b>: A chemical messenger in the brain.
    Alterations in the neurotransmitter have been implicated in
    several brain disorders.</p>
    <p><b>Neuron</b>: Nerve cell; the basic functional unit of
    the nervous system that processes information in the brain.</p>
    <p><b>Neurotransmitter</b>: A chemical messenger in the brain
    which can play a role in brain disorders.</p>
    <p><b>Neurological Disorder</b>: Disorder pertaining to the
    nervous system, which is made up collectively of the brain,
    cranial nerves, spinal cord, spinal nerves, and other nerve
    cells and maintains the vital function of reception and response
    to stimuli. </p>
    <p><b>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</b>: A brain
    disorder characterized by recurrent and persistent thoughts,
    images, or ideas perceived by the sufferer as intrusive and senseless (obsessions)
    and by stereotypic, repetitive, purposeful actions perceived
    as unnecessary (compulsions). The average age of onset is 20.
    OCD is generally chronic, with symptoms waxing and waning.
    The disorder frequently occurs with depression and Tourette&#146;s
    syndrome, a neurological disorder.</p>
    <p><b>Panic Disorder</b>: A brain disorder characterized by
    sudden, inexplicable bouts, or attacks, of intense fear and
    strong bodily symptoms -- namely, increased heart rate, profuse
    sweating, and difficulty in breathing. Panic attacks occur
    twice a week, on average. The disorder is usually chronic,
    with symptoms waxing and waning, and the average age of onset
    is 24. Antidepressants and antianxiety drugs, as well as psychotherapy,
    are often used to treat panic disorder.</p>
    <p><b>Parity</b>: Equal health insurance coverage for brain
    and other physical disorders.</p>

    medications to treat brain disorders, psychotherapy can
    include a range of therapies, including cognitive and
    behavioral.</p>
    <p><b>Reuptake</b>: Removal of a neurotransmitter from the
    synapse by the neuron that released it.</p>
    <p><b>Schizophrenia</b>: A brain disorder characterized by
    disturbance of cognition, hallucinations, and impaired
    emotional responsiveness. Schizophrenia usually begins in the
    late teen years or the early 20s. The disorder cannot now be cured
    or prevented, but its symptoms can be treated.</p>
    <p><b>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</b>:
    Medications which control the transmission of serotonin
    between brain cells and thus help treat the symptoms of such brain
    disorders as depression.</p>
    <p><b>Serotonin</b>: A chemical messenger in the brain. This neurotransmitter
    has been implicated in several brain disorders, including
    major depression and bipolar disorder.</p>
    <p><b>Synapse</b>: The site at which an impulse is
    transmitted from one nerve cell to the other, typically by a
    neurotransmitter.</p>
    <p><b>Tricyclic</b> <b>Antidepressants</b>: Traditional
    medication for depression that acts by blocking reuptake of
    monoamines.</p>

<H1>Herbs By Rainforest Bio-Energetics</H1>
<I>Herbs and functions in italics as outlined in Powerful and Unusual Herbs from the Amazon and China.  Third Edition by the World Preservation Society (Copies for 3.75 each may be obtained by calling 407-965-5996).</I>
<H2>ARCOZONE</H2>
<P>Contains herbs believed to provide essential minerals and nutrients to assist in maintaining nutritional balance and well being.  Spagric extract made with distilled water, 20% ethanol and the following all natural Rainforest botanicals: una de gato, pau d arco. jatoba, suma, espinhiera santa, alfalfa, marapuama, catuaba.</P>
<P><I>Arozon: enhances and stimulates the</I> <B>immune system</B><I>, promotes toxin elimination, stimulates lymphatic drainage, improves circulation, tends to be anti-viral, anti-bacterial, helps the body to eliminate candida overgrowth.  It can help build red blood cells and help people with anemia, diabetes and hypoglycemia.  Other supporting aspects include nervous system calming, brain clearing and focasing, energizing, phlegm reduction, lung clearing, organic toxin removal, circulation promotion, acid neutralization, inflammation cooling.  Because most chronic degenerative complaints, including low energy, arthtritis, asthman, chronic fatigue, gout, and numerous infections, each have to do with a compromised immune system, this herbal combination can have powerful and wide-reaching effects on a person's overall health.</P></I>
<H2>CALMAZON</H2>

<B>Digestazon</B>: promotes<B> improved digestive functions</B><I>, reduces the "bloated" feeling after eating, flushes liver/gall bladder, promotes intestinal function, normalizes ileocecal valve function.  Often people are taking good nutients or supplements, but they are just not being absorbed, which often makes them feel hungry shortly after they have eaten.  When people take Digestazon, the nutrients are more readily absorbed, and therefore people can eat less food and still feel satisfied, which is a key component in a weight-loss program.  Also, people with allergies often have undigested protein and mucous build-up, both os which are dissolved when they take Digestazon.  As well, it can clear parasites, balance ph, fortify the blood, and relieve gas, nausea, and insomnia.</I>
<H2>ENVIROZON</H2>

This can positively affect cholesterol levels, fat, metabolism, blood sugar stabilization, enzyme and hormone production, energy levels, urinary tract infections, and recovery from alcoholic abuses.  As well, it helps with gout, arthritis, asthma, herpes, constipation, hepatitis, chronic fatigue, and acne.  Many inflammatory conditions (the "itis") are neutralized by this product  (Recovazon also "soothes" the "itis" conditions).  This combination of herbs aids the liver in its detoxification process after the ingesting of toxins from our sprayed food as well as our polluted air and water. </I></P>

<B>Lunazon</B>:<I> helps to balance the</I> <B>female endocrine system</B>,<I> and "lunar" cycle.  This can manifest in pituitary, thyroid, adrenal, and ovarian imbalances.  These herbs can increase libido and fertility, relieve vaginal dryness, help cystitis and bladder and urinary tract infections as well as soothe labor pains and after birth pains.  This formuls helps with PMS systems such as mood swings, low energy, irritablility, cramps, bloating, and breast pain.  Also it relieves menopausal systems such as hot flashes by balancing estrogen/progesterone imbalances.  Lunazon is also high in iron, to help with associated anemia and may help women retain and replace calcium in the bones.</I>

This is very helpful with the</I> <B>"afternoon energy slump"</B><I> many people experience and may help hypertension.  It helps stimulate more complete carbohydrate digestion, which allows carbohydrates to break down into sugars; this maintains a long-term stable sugar supply, which combats hypoglycemia.  Therefore, the herbal combination relieves the desire for sweet and thus helps with weight problems and candida.  Those who eat food containing sugar, sucrose, fructose, corn syrup, dextrose, maltodextrin and rice syrup, often find these herbs of great benefit.</I>

 <TITLE> Questions and Answers</TITLE>
<H1>Questions and Answers</H1> 
<B><I>This material is reprinted electronically with permission from Rainforest Bio-Energetics.</I></B><BR>
<P>
<B>Q. Why Rainforest herbs?</B>
<P>Imagine a chunk of real estate the size of the United States and you get an idea of the immensity of the Amazonian Rainforest.  Imagine a virgin tropical environment hundreds of miles from the nearest road or source of pollution.  Think of the Rainforest soil, rich in minerals and trace elements as the forest continuously recycles in a virtually closed ecosystem.  Imagine over 200,000 species of plants thriving in this tropical paradise.
</P>
<P>When you think of herbs, you've got to think of the Amazonian Rainforest as the mother of botanical resources.  Many plant, though known and used for centuries in the Rainforest, are just beginning to get the attention they deserve as the world begins to focus on the treasures of Amazonia.</P>
<B>Q.  How did the actual formulas evolve?</B>
<P>These formulas are based on traditional combinations that have been used by Indigenous Peoples for many years.  Each individual herb has a long history and has been used thousands of times.  For two years the Company worked exclusively with Health Care Practitioners, including medical doctors, chiropractors, acupuncture physicians, nutritionists and athletic trainers.  Through this experience and in cooperation with these professionals, we have refined and fine-tuned these formulas to address the nutritional needs facing the health conscious person living in today's modern environment.</P>
<B>Q.  How do I use the products?</B>
<P>Rainforest Bio-Energetics are food products in the form of a concentrated herbal beverage.  As an herbal drink, we suggest placing 10 to 30 drops into one ounce of pure water.  As there are many body types, some will use less and some will use more.  For children, elderly people, pregnant women or people who are dealing with serious health challenges, we suggest beginning with 3 to 5 drops.  Although we prefer mixing  the product in water, any liquid can be used such as your favorite juice, etc.  To make an excellent hot tea, simply use hot water.  By using Rainforest Bio-Energetics on a daily basis, you will find the way you most enjoy using the products.</P>
<B>Q.  How can I use the products together?</B>
<P>All the formulas are natural food products and are synergistic in nature.  We suggest that you use the products separately in the beginning so you may experience their nutritional benefits individually.  As you gain experience with the formulas you will know when is the best time to use each formula and which combinations you like best.
</P>
<B>Q.  Could I have a 'reaction' to the products?</B>
<P>It is unlikely that anyone would experience a 'reaction'.  However, as with any change in your diet that possibility exists.  If you do experience a reaction, it will be temporary in nature and we suggest discontinuing the product for three days.  Then resume, using one half as much.  As your body acclimates, you may increase to the level that is best for you.</P>
<B>Q.  How is the product manufactured?</B>
<P>Herbs used in the Company's Rainforest Bio-Energetics line are harvested in the sanctity of their natural environment.  Whenever possible, our raw materials are acquired directly from the custodians of the Rainforest--its Ingenous Peoples.  Phyto-sanitary certificates are secured to ensure the quality and purity of each plant.  The botanicals are packed and shipped to the United States with all appropriate documentation.  All shipments are cleared through U.S. Customs, Agriculture and FDA inspection.  Note:  All Rainforest Bio-Energetics herbs are imported, processed and sold as food and nutritional supplements.  No drug claims are made.  As such these products fall into the food (dietary supplement) category of the Food and Drug Administration regulations. </P>
<P>All formulas are processed under exacting standards.  After clearing the company's in house quality control checks, these materials are sent to a special FDA registered lab for further processing and bottling.  This lab is experienced in processing according to the ancient spagyic principles.  We consider this extraction method which emphasizes the 'whole' as simply the finest for preserving and potentizing the full natural energies of the botanicals.</P>
<P>Great care is taken at every step from harvesting in the Rainforest through extraction and bottling to safeguard the quality and ensure the integrity of our products.  A lot number and expiration date is printed on each label and batch samples are retained on deposit.  When processing and bottling is complete, the finished product is returned to our marketing and distribution center in Jupiter, Florida.</P>
<B>Q.  What is the spagyric extraction process?</B>
<P>The spagyric method of botanical preparation, sometimes referred to as "plant alchemy," is based on ancient bio-energetic principles.  The details are proprietary information (trade secret)
but the basic theory involves three important steps.</P>
<P>First the raw material is run in a solution and separated into its three active components.  The essential components are: an oil fraction, a clear volatile fraction and a mineral fraction.  Next, there are special techniques used to purify each of these fractions which enhances the bio-availability of the water soluble, oil soluble and mineral essentials.  The third step is recombining these three fractions into 'whole' again.  Because of the intricacies of this process of this process and the celestial cycles we adhere to, it takes approximately three weeks to manufacture and bottle one batch of product.  This process is an integral part of our objective to deliver to you the full and complete bio-energetic properties of the Rainforest. </P>
<B>Q.  Why are liquid supplements preferable to capsules?</B>
<P>Unlike capsules, the liquid supplement is available for absorption into your system without having to be digested first.  This bio-availability means that you receive the full strength benefit of all the herbal ingredients right away.</P>
<B>Q.  I see there is ethanol on the label.  Why is the alcohol used?</B>
<P>Ethanol is a natural alcohol distilled from grains.  It is in Rainforest Bio-Energetics for several reasons.  In our extraction process, it is the preferred solvent for breaking down the oil and tannin components of the botanicals.  Secondly, alcohol acts as a stabilizer holding all the active essential components of the botanicals in solution for an indefinite period of time.  Ethanol also serves as a carrier for the solution, further enhancing its bio-availability.
</P>
<P>For those who may be alcohol sensitive, we suggest enjoying your herbal beverage as a hot tea.  Placing the drops into warm or hot water will evaporate the alcohol.</P>
<B>Q.  What is used to color and flavor the products?</B>
<P>We do NOT add any colorings or flavorings to any of our products.  The color and flavor of the product is simply the full synergistic compliment of all its natural ingredients.</P>
<B>Q.  What is the shelf life of the products?</B>
<P>As the products are processed and labeled, the lot number and expiration date are printed on each label.  Generally speaking, from the time of manufacture to the expiration date is four years.</P>
<B>Q.  What does Bio-Energetics mean?</B>
<P>Bio-Energetics simply translated means life-energy.  Our name, Rainforest Bio-Energitics exemplifies our commitment to bring you the finest botanical life-energy from the greatest concentrated source of life energy on Earth---the Amazonian Rainforest.
</P>
<P>The Rainforest people have a conscious awareness of the life-enegy of the plants living in their environment.  Sometimes they sing to the plants to create a correct 'resonance' before harvesting.</P>
<B>Q.  What about product claims and the FDA?</B>
<P>As liquid herbal food concentrates, our products come under the Food (dietary supplement) category of the Food and Drug Administration Regulations.  The FDA monitors the import of our raw materials, inspects the manufacturing facility on a regular basis, and determines necessary labeling information.  Since the products are foods and not drugs, it is prohibited to make any claims that the products will treat or cure any disease.
</P>
<P>We believe most everyone can benefit from proper nutrition and diets that include organic minerals and trace elements.  We do not make therapeutic claims.  We are confident that people will have a positive experience with our products and all of our products come with a guarantee of satisfaction.
</P>
<B>Q.  How does using plants from the Rainforest help to preserve the Rainforest?</B>
<P>We advocate the preservation of the Rainforest by promoting the use of sustainable and renewable botanical resources.  By creating an income stream for the herbs, we make the Rainforest more valuable alive than dead (clearcut).</P>
<P>The Indigenous People have an intimate understanding of their ecosystems and have responded very favorably to our approach.  This provides a morally and ecolologically balanced framework to support their need for currency and our need for the mineral rich botanicals of the Rainforest.  We believe this type of exchange, born of correct intent, spawns a greater sharing and understanding between cultures.  Building these channels of trust and mutual respect with a common goal of individual and planetary health is an ongoing endeavor and our corporate mission.</P>
<P>In addition to the way we conduct our business securing our raw materials, we return 1% of all net sales to the Rainforests through our Rainforest Rescue Fund.  Each distributor in the Rainforest Bio-Energetics network can feel satisfaction knowing that a part of each purchase goes to preserve our planet's natural resources.</P>
<P>All of our literature and correspondence is printed on recycled paper.  We use soy-based ink and encourage recycling all bottles and packaging material.</P>

Not being a complete stranger to traveling and trading in various outposts of the Southern Continent (having made over 50 trips since 1976), I can in retrospect say that there was simply no way to anticipate or prepare for my awakening to the bio-energetic principles of the Rainforest.
</P>
<P>Certainly I had spent some time in Amazonia during my treasure seeking years and it had proven to be a formidable foe.  Fueled by a dream to discover lost cities and armed so ineptly with a machete and some survival provisions, the jungle was heavy and overwhelming.  Driven by the scent of treasure, I was constantly tortured by heat, humidity, biting insects and the threat of poisonous snakes.  I knew that the cache was just over the next hill or across the river.</P>
<P>My reward for this determination and persistent sweltering through the semi-permeable molasses of forest was bountiful, and expressed itself in several ways.  There was of course the exhaustion, the fevers, the dysentery, the parasites and other similar benefits too unsavory to discuss, not the least of which was the wounded ego of a treasure hunter with an empty basket.</P>
<P>After several such forays I surmised that the treaures of Amazonia were probably best left in the care of the Rainforest that so diligently guarded them.  After all, by moderate standards, I was doing quite well with handicrafts from the Andes and gemstones from the mines in Brazil and Uraguay.  Realistically, I could have left this remote chunk of real estate to God's birds and beasts and gone on about my business, but this fascination with the interior would not go away.  I now understand Col. Fawcett's (<I>Lost Trails, Lost Cities</I>) preocupation with the mysterious seduction of the forest.</P>
<PRE>
      <B> "The robust healty tribes do not live near the easily navigable 
rivers, but retire beyond the range of civilized man.... There, I believed,
lay the greatest secrets of the past yet preserved in our world today. 
I had come to the turn of the road and for better or worse I chose
the forest path."
                                                   -Col. P.H. Fawcett</B>
                                      <I>Lost Trails, Lost Cities 1913</I>
</PRE>
<P>My own path continued to criss-cross the Andes, but would occasionally yield to the call of the Amazon.  Invariably I would find myself upriver pursuing my natural trade, engaging in commerce with the indigenous Indians.  Trading in natural artifacts, blow guns, monkey bones, ceramics and textiles was only marginally profitable, but afforded a convenient excuse to continue to journey into the Rainforest.  It was on one of these trips that my life was essentially changed forever.
</P>
<P><I>(Now to regress for just a moment.  My personal health history included a bout of hepatitis and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever that culminated in a death experience in a hospital in North Carolina.  Since that time, 10 years prior to this trip I have been continually challenged by a compromised liver.  As anyone who has dealt with a liver problem knows, the liver serves a multitude of functions.  Symptomatically poor liver function manifests itself as a feeling of low energy, fatigue, ungroundedness, unclear thought processes, and all in all operating at about 60% of my optimal efficiency.  I had been plagued by all these symptoms up to the time of the journey.)</I></P>
<P> I knew I wasn't in top condition when I wandered into Shipibo Vilage.   I was sweating and chilling with a low-grade jungle fever, and I knew I looked shabby and travel- weary.  It had been an exhausting day on the river, and with the searing afternoon heat I was feeling a bit sideways and stir-fried.  Along with a suitable site to tie my hammock, I was offered some Una de Gato (<I>Uncarla Tomentosa</I>) and Chancca Piedra (<I>Phyllantius Niruri</I>) teas.  I drank about a liter of this combination, and by morning the fever was broken and I was feeling better.</P>
<P>After three days of resting and drinking these teas, my health improved significantly and I was ready to travel again.  I took some of the Gato vine and Chanca Piedra shrub with me and continued to use these herbs daily. I continued to sense noticable improvements in my health.  After about ten days of using these Rainforest herbs, I realized I was in better health than I had been in years.  I had a strong sense of connectedness, clarity of thought, an energetic power and internal chi.  I was breathing easier and my posture was more erect.    In fact, I was in better health than I had ever been, even before hepatitis and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever!  Yet as dramatic as this rejuvenation was, it was only the beginning.</P>
<P> Being now newly charged, I began to hear the call of those treasure sirens again.  A couple of days further upriver, I stepped out of the dugout canoe into a double canopy forest and was immediately aware of something which I had never noticed before.  I could sense a very powerful energy coming from the forest.  I felt that magical moment of discovering a treasure that you are not looking for.</P>
<P> There was a new awakening and a realization that I was standing in the highest concentration of life-energy on our planet.  Incredible symbiotic relationships were all around me.  Of an estimated 200,000 species of plants in this forest, only 2% have been thoroughly studied.  New species of birds and frogs are identified each year, and new insects discovered every day.  Clearly the Amazonian Rainforest is our planet's greatest natural treasure house. </P>
<P> This was a new perception for me.  It was as if I had passed through a filter-  a screening process-  and the blinders had been removed.  The plants were radiating a clear life-energy.  The Rainforest was no longer my foe.  This is simply the most awe-inspiring living eco-system on the face of the earth .  Everything is being recycled.  An iguana could not die at my feet and he completely consumed in a matter of minutes- nothing left but clean bones.  Life begetting life.  A leaf would fall from the top canopy, drift down, hit the forest floor, decompose and another plant utilizing those nutrients would grow right back out.</P>
<P>There is a variety of flying and crawling and biting insects; some of which choose to fly, to crawl on and bite me.  Some even saw greater opportunities in burrowing into my skin, laying their eggs and raising families.  I was just another host organism in this environment.  I wasn't at the top of the food chain any longer either.  The jagaur, cayman and snakes in this area could take me out for nutritional content.  Nature's decision here is clear and absolute- there is no appeal process.  It is a very humbling experience to recognize oneself as a minority species, as part of the living mosaic of the whole.</P>
<P>The living forest maintains its ecological harmony.  There are many members of our species who have a clear understanding of the energetics of this environment and its symbiotic balance.  These are of course the Shipibo, Machegunga, Campa, Aguaruana and all other groups who call the forest home.  These people had renewed my life with Una de Gato and Chanca Piedra, and from them I began to learn the true value of the Rainforest botanicals.  Through our narrow model of scientific and clinical methodology, studies have shown the immune enhancing properties of Una de Gato and the liver rejuvenating characteristics of Chanc Piedra, but the true value of these Amazonian botanicals goes far beyond a "this for that" mentality. </P>
<P>The plants from the Amazonian Rainforest serve as a store of nutrients, as well as trace elements and minerals from the rich soil of this environent.  This is very important in that much of the food supply grown in this country is grown in soil that has been depleted of many of the essential trace elements and minerals.  Yet these trace elements and minerals are the very building blocks of health.  Without them, even vitamins can't do their job efficiently.</P>
<P>When harvesting botanicals in the forest, often the indigenous people will sing to the plants to set up the correct resonance.  These songs ask for the plant's permission and willingness to transfer its essential bio-energetic properties.  But even more important is the idea of how this high concentration of life energy is stored and transferred.  The botanicals of the Amazon serve as a conduit of information of our planet's greatest living treasure house of species and nutrients.</P>
<P>In<B><I> The Secret Life of Plants </I></B> Peter Tompkins and Christopher Byrd demonstrate that plants interact with their environment.  Plants growing to classical music grew better than plants exposed to heavy rock music.  Even more profound were their experiments connecting plants to polygraph machines and measuring their response to a variety of environmental criteria including changes in behavior and the emotional state of the plant's owner.  Their results seem to confirm some type of photosynthetic intelligence in living plants.</P>
<P> Also worth considering is Carl Jung's theory of the "collective unconscious".  Recent DNA research has demonstrated the possibility that the collective information of our ancestors is encoded in our genes.  This suggests that when we recognize or learn something seemingly new,  it is simply bringing the pre-known stored data into present awareness.<P>
<P>
<H4><B>Many of us have a sincere and genuine concern for the survival of the Rainforest.  Unquestionably the ecologically-intact  Amazonia is threatened.  Perhaps some of us are just tapping into this "collective unconscious"  as to the true value of the Rainforest.  Perhaps the botanical intelligence from the Rainforest is playing a role in manifesting this awareness.</P>
<P>The true value of the the Rainforest botanicals lies not only in their rich nutrient value, trace minerals and phtyo-pharamacological properties, but in the stored information of a thousand generations of ecological harmony.  When we consider the environmental chaos that seems to be accelerating- as evidenced by dramatic changes in weather patterns and seismatic activity- perhaps the subtle energies of the Rainforest are what will nourish our awareness to value symbiotic balance at all levels of experience.  The knowledge of our Creator's green temple is now being unveiled as the consciousness of natural healing comes of age.</B></H4></P>

  <H1>RAINFOREST FACTS</H1>
<BODY>
<P>The Amazonian Rainforest covers over a billion acres, encompassing areas in Brazil, Venzuela, Colombia and the Easterm Adean region of Ecuador and Peru.  If Amazonia were a country, it would be the ninth largest.
</P><P>
One hectare (2.47 acres) may contain over 750 types of trees and 1500 species of Higher plants.</P>
<P>The Amazon has over 1000 tributaries and is over three miles wide in some parts.  One sixth of all the freshwater that flows on the earth moves through the Amazon drainage system, greater flow volume than the next eight largest rivers combined!  An ocean-going vessel can cruise over 2300 miles up the mighty river, almost crossing the entire continent of South America.</P><P>  <H1>THE GOOD NEWS</H1>
<P>Our remarkable tropical Rainforests are beautiful, precious and teaming with life.  Over half of the world's known plant and animal species call the Rainforest their home.  With thousands of life-forms still being identified, you can imagine the vast potential this botanical treasure house offers in health and nutritional values.</P>
<P>Is there a piece of the Rainforest near you?  Consider this--fully 80% of the developed worlds's diet originated in the tropical Rainforest.  We are surrounded by its bountiful gifts:  </P>
<P>Rice, corn, potatoes, sugarcane, bananas, oranges, coffee, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, chocolate, pineapples, avacados, vanilla, grapefruit and a variety of spices and teas all had their origins in the world's Rainforests.  At least 3000 fruits may be available in the Rainforest:  of these, only 200 are now in use.  Some, like cherimoya, papaya and mango are only recently being enjoyed in the northern markets.</P>
<P>The Rainforests also provide essential environmental services for all of us.  Because the Amazon Rainforest is continuosly recycling carbon dioxide into oxygen, it has been described as the "Lungs of our Planet."</P>
<H1>THE BAD NEWS</H1>
<P>A large part of the world's greatest Rainforests are being leveled for farming, ranching and logging.  It appears we are losing Earth's greatest biological treasures just as we are beginning to appreciate their true value.</P>
<P>"The chainsaws and fires are doing their work in the world's tropical forests.  An acre and a half of these forest are lost every second with tragic consequences for both developing and industrial countries."   World Resources Institute. </P>
<P>"Nearly half of the world's species of plants, animals and microorganisms will be destroyed or severely threatened over the next quarter century."  Peter Raven, Our Diminishing Tropical Rainforests.
</P>
<P>"In the year 1979, 29,000 square miles of Rainforests were destroyed.  In 1990, the rate accelerated to 55,000 square miles per year. That is an area larger than the state of Florida, lost each year."  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations</P>
<P>Of more than 265,000 known plant species, less than three percent have been tested for their medical applications, yet out of this tiny portion have come 25 percent of all medicines."  Michael Blalick, Director, Institute of Economic Botany</P>
<P>"Each time a medicine man dies, it is as if a library has burned down."  Dr. Mark Plotkin, Ethnobotanist, Conservation International.</P>
<P>There were an estimated ten million Indians living in the Amazonian Rainforest five centuries ago.  Today, there are less than 200,000.</P>
<H1>THE GOOD NEWS</H1>
<P>When managed properly, the forest can provide for our needs on a perpetual basis.  We believe that harvesting the Rainforest's life-giving resources on a sustainable basis will stop the destruction of these imperiled ecosystems.</P>
<P>By purchasing renewable Rainforest products we help to protect the Rainforest and support the native people's economy.  Sufficient demand for sustainable Rainforest products is necessary for preservation efforts to succeed.  We can effect positive change.  By sharing these ideas and Rainforest products with others we are promoting individual and planetary health.
</P>
<P>Use the products regularly, become familar with the Rainforest's nutritional benefits and help protect a world resource at risk.</P>

<P>
 <H3> WARRIOR BONUS POOL</H3>
2% of Company's monthly sales is in this pool.<BR>
Any Platinum Warrior who is fully blocked from<BR>
any 1 leg of Infinity Bonus by downline, qualifies for<BR>
this pool.  This pool divided pro-rata by those who qualify.<BR>
 
<P>The first level in our program is the Wholesale Associate where you can retail product and sponsor a small 
network of distributor/ consumers.  As a Wholesale Associate with $50 PV (personal volume), you may qualify to receive 10% of BV (bonus volume) on the purchases made by the people you directly sponsor into RBE.  The next position is that of Ambassador where you begin building other leadership skills within your group by assisting your downline to build a second level of participants, and chart a course for their own success.  With a $100 PV (personal volume), you may now qualify for the 3 Star Ambassador level of achievement by creating 3 active legs of Ambassadors and earn 10% BV on everyone through 3 levels.  By adding one more active leg to your organization for a total of 4, you will become a 4 Star Ambassador and earn 10% through 4 levels of sponsorship.  By adding a fifth active leg, you will be promoted to the position of 5 Star Ambassador and earn a 5th level of 10% BV.</P>
<P>Once you have earned the position of 5 Star Ambassador, you now qualify for one of the most exciting and profitable compensation concepts offered in the Network Marketing industry.  When you understand the profit potential at this level, you will want to obtain this position as quickly as is humanly possible.</P>
<H3>THE WARRIOR INFINITY BONUS</H3>
<P>The Warrior Infinity Bonus is designed to give extraordinary rewards to extraordinary leadership performance.  This bonus gives 5 Star Ambassadors the potential of earning a percentage on their organization from the 6th level down, regardless of depth.  The Infinity Bonus is paid in addition to the 5 level bonuses.  This bonus is paid on all legs and interrupted only by other downline Ambassador qualified for the Warrior Infinity Bonus on a specific leg.  When that happens, the higher degree Ambassador still receives the difference between their bonus percentage.  Look at the profit plan diagram and you will see that you can qualify for an additional 1%, 3%, 5%, or up to 8% of BV on your organization from the 6th level down.  That simply means you could earn up to as much as 10% on your first five levels and up to 8% on the 6th level down to infinity.</P>
<H3>WARRIOR BONUS POOL</H3>
<P>The Warrior Bonus Pool is 2% of the company's total monthly sales.  Any month a qualified Platinum Warrior also has a qualified Platinum Warrior in his downline, he qualifies for this fund.  The fund is divided Pro-rata.</P>

<H1>NEW KID ON THE BLOCK</H1>
<H3><I>Money Maker's Monthly- July 1996</I></H3>
<H2>RAINFOREST BIO-ENERGETICS</H2>
<H2>THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF AMAZON JOHN</H2>

<P>It's not often you run headlong into a real story of adventure.  Even though it reads like an Indian Jones action novel, it's actually a true story of "Amazon John" Easterling and Rainforest Bio-Energetics@.  It's a story of adventure and discovery complete with lost civilizations, sacred sites, pre-Columbian treasure, ancient curses, near death experiences, and life saving botanicals from the Rainforest.  "Amazon John" is a degreed environmentalist and a lifetime member of the South American Explorers Club with 20 years experience and over I 00 trips into the jungle's interior.  His is a saga that includes many chapters of incredible encounters and fantastic discovery while other events are almost too intense to discuss.  Indeed there are still places in the world where fact is more phenomenal than fiction.
His life started off normally enough.  He was born to a typical American family, went to a typical American school and had a typical American boyhood, at least until the fateful day when "that" issue of The Weekly Reader arrived in his third grade classroom.</P>
<P>Each week, the publication featured a story about a young child from some exotic part of the globe.  On this day, it was Raul and his llama, high in the snow capped Andes mountains, "living the adventure" every day.  It was a story that captured young John's imagination and set his heart to beating like the drum of discovery.</P>
<P>As he learned of the Inca history, his mind raced with the possibilities - lost cities of untold wealth - advanced civilizations vanished off the face of the earth - scattered ruins deep in the jungle or hidden in the mountains, still living the "old ways".  He was awakened to a whole new world, and suddenly knew that this was to be his destiny.  He requested an immediate reassignment to Peru.</P>
<P>After graduating from college, with a degree in Environmental Studies, John sold his car and bought a ticket to Ecuador to begin his search for lost treasure.  From there, he traveled by bus through Peru and began to experience a special bonding with the South American continent.  To him, it was a land brimming with mystery, intrigue and opportunity.  Some highland Indians introduced him to the alpaca.  This high altitude relative of the llama is the central focus of native Andean life.  It has the softest and most durable wool of any animal on the planet.  He returned home with a handful of traditional handicrafts, woven by natives from the wool of the alpaca, and discovered that others also recognized the quality and value they represented.  Thus began his first importing business.</P>
<P>Over the next several years, John made many trips between North and South America.  He supported himself with his native handicrafts business, but was also able to spend months at a time exploring the ruins of Machu Picchu, Tiahuanaco, Tambo Machay, Paracas and Nazca.  He was finally living his dream, searching for lost treasure!  He learned a valuable secret--when you yield to the siren of adventure, your life takes on its true course and all the obstacles to your dreams are shattered.</P>
<P>Eventually he got into some ancient sites and began an avocation in Pre-Columbian textiles, dealing with museums and collectors around the world.  The search for lost cities led over the Andes and into the Amazon.  Going upriver he developed a trade in Amazon basin tribal artifacts.  The more time he spent in the Rainforest, the more he came to appreciate the Indigenous People's knowledge and heritage of Amazonian botanicals.</P>
<P>John's health had been compromised earlier in life with a serious bout of hepatitis and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.  In fact, he had a near death experience from that in a hospital in North Carolina.  As a result, he suffered from chronic and long lasting periods of fatigue and. low grade fevers and compromised liver function.</P>
<P>Some Shipibo Indians on the headwaters of the Amazon shared some Ufia de Gato and Quebra Pedra teas with John.  After a few days of drinking this herbal combination, he felt an increased sense of balance and revitalization.  His energy returned.  His sense of groundedness, his mental acuity, everything improved not only to the point where he was before he was sick but to an even higher plateau of health where he had never been.  From that point on he maintained a personal stash of these herbs.</P>
<P>He continued making trips "upriver" collecting blowguns, carved monkey bones and other artifacts, not fully realizing that he had been introduced to the real treasure of Amazonia-the life force of the Rainforest itself.
After ten years and over 50 trips, he sold the business, Raiders of the Lost Art, with the intention of spending some time in Tibet.  He was planning one last trip through South America to stockpile his dwindling herb supply when, as the wheel of fortune spins, he reconnected with Nicole Maxwell.</P>
<P>Nicole is the author of "Witchdoctor's Apprentice," first published in 1961, and a dear friend of his.  She spent 40 years of her life doing research and collecting botanicals in the Rainforest of Peru.  He always enjoyed her wit and wisdom.  When she expressed an interest in returning to Peru, his new path became clear.  His consciousness shifted and he began to fully realize that the dense tropical jungle that he had grudgingly macheted his way through searching for lost treasure, was, in fact, itself the real treasure.  There came a realization that he was standing in the highest concentration of life energy on the planet.  Nicole's uncompromising spirit for life made her a wonderful travel companion and an invaluable source of inspiration.</P>
<H3>Sharing the Adventure</H3>
<P>Health care professionals whom he had known encouraged further exploration of the potential for traditional nutritional formulas from the Rainforest.  The Rainforest BioEnergetics@ Company was formed and an exciting cooperative effort was born.  Using the same diligence with when he had previously pursued ancient artifacts, Easterling committed himself to the Rainforest Bio-Energetics@ mission.</P>
<P>As products were shared and the benefits were experienced, more and more practitioners became involved in using Rainforest-Bio-Energetics@.  As the word spread from person to person, they began receiving calls from others requesting the products.  After researching modalities as to how best to expose these products to a larger audience, network marketing evolved as the natural choice, since this was in effect the way the information was being carried already.</P>
<P>Rainforest Bio-Energetics@ is a six year old, multimillion dollar company that is just now entering its "Acceleration Phase." The Company's mission is to create a new vision of Rainforest consciousness, planetary health and economic destiny.  It was founded around three simple principles which form a circle-adventure, discovery and empowerment.  Rainforest Bio-Energetics@  Associates are encouraged to embark on an adventure of exploration, finding new possibilities for their own health of the planet.  They will discover the magical healing power of the concentrated life energy of the Rainforest and they will be empowered to bring new meaning into their lives, not only profitting themselves, but empowering the Indigenous People of the Rainforest to make decisions about their future.</P>
<P>The company's product formulas are based on traditional combinations that have been used by the Indigenous Peoples of Amazonia for may years.  Each individual herb has a long history of safe and successful use.  In addition, the Company has worked closely with hundreds of medical doctors, chiropractors, acupuncturists, nutritionists and athletic trainers since its inception to obtain a better understanding through carefully controlled observation, of how these nutritional supplements benefit those who use them.  This information has been used to fine tune the formulas in order to address the nutritional needs facing all health conscious people in modern society-Amazon John even goes further in explaining why these formulas are so necessary today.</P>
<P>The true value of the Rainforest botanicals lies not only in their rich nutrient value, trace minerals and phyto-pharmacological properties, but in the stored information of a thousand generations of ecological harmony.  When we consider the environmental chaos that seems to be accelerating-as evidenced by dramatic changes in weather patterns and seismic activity-perhaps the subtle energies of the Rainforest are what will nourish our awareness to the valued symbiotic balance at all levels of experience.  These Rainforest nutritional products are how being unveiled to a greater population as the consciousness for the real treasures of Amazonia comes of age.</P>

<H3>Preserving the Rainforest</H3>
<P>Herbs used in the Company's products are harvested with a respect for their natural environment.  Rainforest Bio-Energetics@ maintains a permanent company facility in the Amazon for collecting and grading raw material.  They work directly with the Indigenous People to ecologically harvest these herbal treasures.  When you are connected with Rainforest Bio-Energetics@ you know you are connected to the source.</P>
<P>The Company advocates the preservation of the Rainforests by promoting the use of sustainable and renewable botanical resources.  By creating an income stream for the herbs, we make the Rainforest more valuable alive than dead (clear cut).</P>
<P>The Indigenous People have an ultimate understanding of their ecosystems and have responded very favorably to the Company's approach.  This provides a morally and ecologically balanced framework to support their need for currency and our need for the mineral rich botanicals of the Rainforest.  Rainforest Bio-Energetics@ believes this type of exchange born of correct intent spawns a greater sharing and understanding between cultures.  Building these channels of trust and mutual respect with a common goal of individual and planetary health is an ongoing endeavor and the corporate mission.</P>
<P>In addition to the way the Company conducts their business securing raw materials, they return 1% of all net sales to the Rainforests through their Rainforest Rescue Fund.  Each Associate in the Rainforest Bio-Energetics@ network can feel satisfaction knowing that they are doing their part and that creating sufficient demand for Rainforest products is necessary for preservation efforts to succeed.</P>
<P>All company literature and correspondence is printed on recycled paper.  They use soy-based ink and encourage recycling all bottles and packaging material.</P>
<P>The formulas are processed under exacting standards.  The active herbal agents are concentrated using its proprietary process, which emphasizes the "whole" nutritional complement of the plant.  The method of botanical preparation sometimes referred to as "plant alchemy" is based on ancient bioenergetic principles.  To maximize bioavailability, most of the extracts are presented in liquid form.  This process is an integral part of the Company's objective to deliver the full and complete bioenergetic properties of the Rainforest.  When added to pure water, they create excellent teas. </P>
<P>Una de Gato, or "Cat's Claw" serves as a base for many of the Company's products.  Una de Gato is referred to by
many as the most important botanical of our time.  Rainforest Bio-Enerc,etics@ first introduced this incredible herb to U.S. doctors in 1991, predicting it would become a legend.  Rainforest Bio-Energetics@ is the leading importer of Ufia de Gato and guarantees the highest quality.  There are other Rainforest herbs which are well known such as Pau d'Arco, Suma, and Stevia and many more destined for the spotlight such as Muira Puama and Chuchubusasi.  IlluminationTM, which is the flagship product, is a combination of the premier botanicals of the Rainforest into a single synergistic formula.  It contains Una de gato, pau d'arco, suma, tayuya and 29 other herbal components.  Other products are Arcozon Calmazon, Digestazon, Envirozon, Metabazon, Lunazon, Warrior, Recovazon, Suma, and Una de Gato.  For many of these products, the names are suggestive of their benefits.  Excellent Company literature provides ample additional information.</P>

<H3>The Amazon Warrior Profit Plan</H3>
<P>In today's competitive marketplace, every MLM company strives to achieve the pinnacle of success.  Rainforest Bio-Energetics@, Inc. is no different.  But that's where the comparison ends.  No other company can claim such a unique and proven product line.  But quality products alone will not sustain a multi million dollar growth pattern.  The company must also provide solid marketing concepts and a compensation plan which offers the serious minded distributor a significant financial opportunity.  In addition, it is critical to provide the part timer and "consumer/distributor" enough incentive to stay active month after month as distributors and product consumers.
Rainforest Bio-Energetics@'s compensation plan is simple, straightforward and easy to explain while being extremely profitable for both the new distributor and the experienced MLM professional.  There are no breakaways or group volume requirements.  A personal purchase keeps you qualified.  Besides a very generous discount off the retail value, distributors may earn 10% on 5 levels of sales o their groups.  In addition, the Warrior Infinity Bonus pays up to an additional 8% on your organization beginning on the 6th level through infinity.  And the Warrior Bonus Pool of 2% of total company monthly sales is shared by top performers on a Pro-rata basis.</P>
<P>In order to help distributors earn money quickly, a weekly Quick Start Bonus of $ 100 is paid to sponsors on each newly sponsored Associates purchase of an optional Quick Start Kit.  This consists of over $500 in Rainforest Bio-Energetics@ products, purchased for only $300.  This represents more than a 40% discount for the new Associate.  Power growth is made easy by the use of the revolutionary Fast Tract 500 business building program.  Rainforest Bio-Energetics@ has developed an exciting audio brochure on cassette tape that will make your telephone ring with new prospects.  If you decide to work the Fast Track system, you simply purchase the required tapes for mailing to prospects. Then the Company will co-op with you by giving you an equal number of tapes free.

 From ecologically wildcrafting in the Rainforest to the time honored spagyric processing here, they can ensure the quality and safeguard the integrity of the product.  Every step of the process from the Rainforest to the finished product in your hand is totally focused on delivering to you the full and complete phyto-nutrient and bio-energetic properties of the Rainforest.</B>

<P><STRONG>Maximum Color Density:</STRONG>240%, with only one color solid. Two secondary colors should not exceed 70% each. Single colors not intended to print solid should not exceed 80%. For optimum results, recommend the use of Under Color Removal (UCR) and Gray Component Replacement (GCR) when generating separations. Good results have been reported with GCR as high as 60-70%. Actual dot percentages will increase for black and decrease for cyan, magenta and yellow when UCG/GCR is applied.</P>








<P><STRONG>Text & Graphics: </STRONG>Type should only be surprinted in areas having tint values of 30% or less. Four color reverses should not be smaller than 14 points and should only be reversed out of areas having at least 70% tone value in black, magenta or cyan. Remove all colors under reverse to avoid registration problems.</P>





<P><STRONG>Unsharp Masking:</STRONG> Printing on newsprint may soften dots. When the subject matter permits, unsharp masking should be considered to sharpen dots. Refer to Specifications for Non-Heat Advertising Printing (SNAP) for guidelines. Remove colors that contaminate from bright colors.</P>

<a name="11"><H3>Terms & Conditions<hr></H3></a>



<P>The publisher will not be bound by any conditions, printed or otherwise, 
appearing on any order blank, insertion order, or contract when they conflict 
with the terms and conditions of this rate card, or any amendment hereof.</P>



<STRONG>1. General Rate Policy</STRONG>
<blockquote>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> Contract advertisers are those (i) who have placed a yearly order by Barron&#146;s 
Advertising Order form or recognized advertising agency contract accepted by 
the publisher, and (ii) who insert and pay for space in accordance with one of 
the volume or frequency rates specified on the current rate card (e.g., for 
National Edition and Regions, 4 pages minimum; for Current Corporate Reports, 
2 consecutive issues within one year minimum; for The Classifieds, 2-3 issues 
minimum). All other advertisers are non-contract advertisers. <br><br>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> To earn volume or frequency rates, a signed contract or order must be 
received and accepted by the publisher within six months of the first insertion, 
and advertising must be inserted within one year from the effective date of 
such contract or order. <br><br>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> If an advertising contract or order is exceeded or not fulfilled, the rate 
charged will be adjusted to the rate earned within 60 days after the 
termination of the contract period. Nonpayment of invoices may result in the 
termination of an advertising contract and a corresponding adjustment in the 
rate(s) charged. <br><br>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> The publisher reserves the right, at any time and for any reason, to decline 
any advertising copy and to cease further publication of any advertising 
without rate penalty to the advertiser. 	<br><br>	
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> Only publication of an advertisement shall constitute final acceptance of the 
advertiser&#146;s order. <br><br>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> The publisher shall in no event be liable for failure to publish advertising when 
specified by the advertiser, provided that, if no advertising is published, any 
charges therefore received by the publisher shall be refunded. <br><br>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> The publisher reserves the right to revise, on notice of 30 days, any rates, 
terms and conditions of this rate card applicable to contract advertisers. 
Revisions affecting non-contract advertising may be made without notice.<p>
</blockquote>

<STRONG>2. Contract And Copy Regulations</STRONG><p>
<blockquote>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> All advertisements are accepted for publication entirely upon the representation 
that the agency and/or advertiser is/are properly authorized to publish the 
entire contents and subject matter thereof. It is understood that, in 
consideration of the publication of advertising, the advertiser and/or agency 
will fully hold harmless and fully indemnify the publisher from and against any 
and all claims, demands, suits, actions, proceedings, recoveries or expenses of 
any nature whatsoever, including reasonable fees of counsel selected by the 
publisher, arising directly or indirectly from the publication of any advertisement 
(including, but not limited to, claims of infringement of copyright or trademark 
or claims of libel or invasion of privacy) or based upon or arising out of any 
matter or thing contained in any advertisement. <br><br>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> We cannot guarantee an advertisement will not be backed by an 
advertisement with a coupon. The following copy and contract regulations 
listed in Standard Rate and Data (Newspapers  General Display) are 
applicable: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 
23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.<p>
</blockquote>
<STRONG>3. Commission And Payment</STRONG><p>
<blockquote>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> Advertising agencies recognized by the publisher receive a commission of 15% 
of gross. If advertiser/agency is credit approved, advertiser/agency agrees to 
remit payment for advertising on or before the end of the month following that 
in which advertising is published.<br><br>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> Advertising agencies are responsible for payment of all advertising ordered 
on behalf of their clients, but the publisher reserves the right to hold the agency 
and the advertiser jointly and severally liable for all such payments.<br><br>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> Advertisements from a recognized agency promoting its own advertising 
agency services receive a 25% discount off card rates. No other commissions 
or discounts apply.</p>

<H3>75 Years Ago Today (January 16, 1922)</H3><p>

<STRONG>Selling Dead Stocks</STRONG>
<BR><BR>
A lot of selling in Erie was done by a few big holders who had
carried the a stock for years and were convinced that it was among
the &#147;dead&#148; ones so far as the immediate future of the
market was concerned. This accounts for the sudden appearance
of selling in many such issues. People drag along for years with
a stock and then find that they are carrying a hopeless investment
and sell it to get into some other issue which gives more promise
for the future.
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Rockefeller &#147;Boys&#148; Bearing the Market?</STRONG>
<BR><BR>
That the Rockefeller &#147;boys&#148; - Percy and William G. -
are factors in the stock market on an important scale is a story
which has been going the rounds of Wall Street for the past week
or more. And their activity is believed to be on the bearside.
In fact, to them and following is credited much of the weakness
in shares of the Chicago and Northwestern Railway.
<BR><BR>
The sons of William Rockefeller are not novices in stock speculation;
nor are they always successful in their Wall Street ventures.
But in recent turns their winnings are believed to have been fairly
substantial.

<a name="B"><H3>The History of Barron's, The Dow Jones Business and Financial Weekly
</H3></a>



<P><STRONG>BARRON'S</STRONG> magazine first appeared on the nation's newsstands May 9, 1921, at a seemingly unlikely time -- the depth of a post-World War I recession.</P>




<P>But to Clarence W. Barron, the publication's founder and namesake, the time was right: &quot;A fresh financial publication based on sound sources of information and policy should be a helpful factor in assuring return of confidence to the world of business,&quot; he wrote in that first issue.</P>


 

<P>      Mr. Barron, president and owner of Dow Jones & Company, served as editor of the magazine to which he applied the motto &quot;the application of money to positive ends.&quot; Son-in-law Hugh Bancroft, who proposed the financial weekly -- with an eye toward making use of <EM>Wall Street Journal</EM>  presses that were idle on Sundays -- was the magazine's publisher. </P>




<P><strong>Barron's</strong>  initial cover price was 20 cents, and an annual subscription was $10. The introductory issue's cover story, &quot;European Unsettlements -- The Distress of France,&quot; carried Mr. Barron's byline. When<EM> Barron's</EM>  made its debut, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (then comprised of 20 stocks) was a lofty 79.48. The first issue was 16 pages and sold approximately 9,000 copies. Circulation in this 75th anniversary year is over 275,000. </P>




<P>As circulation has grown, so has <strong>Barron's</strong>  reputation for journalism that affects corporations and financial markets and that is consistently ahead of the curve. Some historical examples:</P>


<blockquote>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> Exposed financial discrepancies in the New Haven Railroad's 1955 annual report. The discrepancies, covering up financial woes, subsequently led the railroad to file for bankruptcy.<BR>
<BR>

<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> Scored a 1970 coup on the imminent collapse of the Bernard Cornfield empire, Investors Overseas Services, LTD., which <strong>Barron's</strong>  began to suspect from the strange action of I.O.S. stock on the London market.<BR>
<BR>

<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> Correctly forecast the disaster that befell holders of $2.4 billion of Washington Power Supply System bonds; 1983.<BR>
<BR>

<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> Months before the October 1987 market crash, headlined an article &quot;Bears Take Over The World&quot; and warned that the Federal Reserve would likely tighten credit.<BR>
<BR>

<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> An August 1988 cover story, &quot;The Coming Collapse in Home Prices,&quot; gave readers an early warning of the impending fall in residential real estate prices.<BR>
<BR>

<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> Broke the story on the perils ahead for investment portfolios of life insurers; 1990.<BR>
<BR>

<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> Warned of the pitfalls of exotic derivatives securities in 1993, well ahead of the derivatives trading woes that ultimately bankrupted California's Orange County.
</blockquote>


<P><strong>Barron's</strong>  initial focus on stocks and bonds has broadened through the years, tracking reader interest in a widening array of investment vehicles. During the '70s, the business and financial weekly added columns on commodities, options, international stock exchanges and the domestic real estate market. The '80s brought such <strong>Barron's</strong>  features as the Sotheby's Art Index and the weekly column Current Yield, an analysis of bond markets. The '90s, so far, have seen expanded mutual funds coverage, including the recent introduction of an annual assessment of mutual fund families; the launch of <strong>Barron's</strong>  quarterly Big Money Poll, a survey of major institutional money managers' views on financial markets; and stepped-up coverage of the technology industry with the opening of a bureau in Palo Alto, Calif.</P>


       <strong>Barron's</strong>  75th birthday is a milepost achieved by fewer than one in 150 magazines. With 75 years experience, <strong>Barron's</strong>  remains forward-looking, and what it sees transcends the printed page: &quot;<strong>Barron's</strong>  will join the rush to the Internet, launching a Web-based weekly edition,&quot; Editor Edwin A. Finn Jr. said. &quot;Readers of the on-line edition, for example, will be able to get historical financial data and stock market information about any company mentioned and do their own customized investment research using <strong>Barron's</strong>  data.&quot;
      

<P><STRONG>Barron's</STRONG>  is also enhancing its international presence with the addition of correspondents in Tokyo and London. Its first international forum was held recently in Tokyo. Another is scheduled later this year.</P>


       

<P>In the 75 years since Clarence Barron launched his weekly financial magazine, it has become more comprehensive, even global. What hasn't changed is the commitment to provide readers the best intelligence for making wise investment decisions.</P>

<BR>

<a name="C"><h3>Who Was Clarence Walker Barron?</H3></a>




<P>CLARENCE W. BARRON (1855-1928), founder of <strong>Barron's</strong> magazine and generally considered the &quot;father of financial journalism,&quot; was born July 2, 1855, in Boston, to Henry, a struggling merchant, and Elana Barron. Clarence Barron began his journalism career at the <EM>Boston Daily News</EM>, writing on business and economics before he was 20 years old. He moved to the <EM>Boston Transcript</EM> as a reporter in 1875 and, convincing his editors of the value of reporting the news affecting the market tables, created the newspaper's first financial section and served as its editor.</P>




<P>In July 1887, when just 32 years old, Mr. Barron decided there was need of a service that would publish financial news during the day in bulletin form and established the Boston News Bureau, a newspaper regarded as the &quot;Financial Bible of New England.&quot; Subsequently, he arranged for the Boston News Bureau to exchange news with Dow Jones & Company, which also published financial bulletins, and The Wall Street Journal in New York. In 1896 he founded the Philadelphia News Bureau.</P>




<P>  In 1902 Mr. Barron acquired Dow Jones from ailing founder Charles H. Dow and partner Charles Bergstresser. Co-founder Edward D. Jones had left the company three years earlier.</P>




<P>Mr. Barron was initially a passive owner, preferring to spend time at his home and farm in Massachusetts. He met with the board of directors in 1902 and then not again for almost 10 years, infrequently visiting Dow Jones' offices. He was more actively involved with Doremus & Company, the financial advertising firm he established in 1904. His wife, Jessie, was his representative on the Dow Jones board, and she assumed an active role in the company.</P>




<P>But it was almost inevitable that Mr. Barron, a colorful individual with influential friends and a seemingly endless amount of energy, would become more involved in running Dow Jones. The turning point occurred in 1912 when, suspecting the company faced a financial slump, he became president and assumed day-to-day control. In addition to his management function, he became editor of <EM>The Wall Street Journal</EM> and its lead reporter, often filing dispatches on finance and politics, many during his frequent trips to Europe. Under his tutelage, Journal writing and headlines became crisper and profiles of business people were added.</P>




<P>It was Mr. Barron's reporting that exposed Charles Ponzi's investment scam in 1920. Mr. Ponzi, who Mr. Barron claimed was paying investors exorbitant yields in a pyramid scheme using money from subsequent investors, countered with a $5 million libel suit. The expos&eacute; ultimately led to Mr. Ponzi's conviction. The libel action against Mr. Barron was dismissed.</P>




<P>Convinced of the need for a national, weekly financial magazine, Mr. Barron, then 66 years old, introduced <strong>Barron's</strong> on May 9, 1921. He wrote the lead story in the first issue, <EM>European Unsettlements -- The Distress of France</EM>, while in Paris. At its launch, Barron's, The National Financial Weekly, had a cover price of 20 cents and an annual subscription price of $10.</P>




<P>Mr. Barron wrote several books, including &quot;Twenty-eight Essays on The Federal Reserve Act,&quot; &quot;The Audacious War,&quot; &quot;The Mexican Problem&quot; and &quot;A World Remaking, or Peace Finance.&quot; His edited notes and writings, including records of conversations with the likes of Calvin Coolidge and Henry Ford, were published as &quot;They Told Barron&quot; and &quot;More They Told Barron.&quot;</P>




<P>Despite frequent health problems compounded by his immense girth (upwards of 330 pounds on a 5-foot-5-inch frame), Mr. Barron remained active as president of Dow Jones and editor and writer for The Wall Street Journal and Barron's until shortly before his death on Oct. 2, 1928, at age 73. He was predeceased by Jessie, a widow with two daughters when she married Clarence, and stepdaughter Martha. He was survived by stepdaughter Jane Bancroft and her husband, Hugh, who was the first publisher of <strong>Barron's</strong> and an officer of Dow Jones. Their descendents continue to have a controlling interest in Dow Jones, and three members of the Bancroft family are directors of the company.</P><BR>

<STRONG>How money becomes wealth.</STRONG>&reg;<BR><BR>




In our experience, successful investors generally share these traits:<BR><BR>




<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> All take a long-term view of their objectives and the markets. They form strong views and never blindly follow the herd.<BR>
<BR>


<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> They are all disciplined planners and hard workers. They don't get emotionally attached to companies or investment ideas. When it's time to act, they act decisively.<BR><BR>


<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> They neither shun nor embrace risk but spend a lot of time understanding and managing it.<BR><BR>


<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> In other words, they are voracious and creative users of information. They are in the business of turning information into insight, and investing money in those insights.<BR><BR>





<P>At Barron's, we too are in the investment information/insight business. Each week, we look back over the last week and forward to the weeks ahead, always trying to cut through the fog and the fads and place events in a perspective that will be useful to our readers.</P>

Most readers pick up magazines with passing interest. Our readers pick up Barron's with passionate interest. Because they know information and ideas of value are on every page, and they don't want to miss a thing. <P>

Every week, Barron's  covers money and markets -- how they come together, what results, and why that's important. Which is why important people read it with absorption...page-after-page, cover-to-cover. And that's the audience, in exactly the right editorial environment, that most advertisers are looking for.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><a href="#top">Back to the top of the page.</a><hr></BLOCKQUOTE>




<a name="B"><H3>Business Profile</H3></a><P>

Business is all about vision. And finance is what translates vision into commercial reality.  Barron's delivers immediate, practical value -- the economic insights, the business case histories that help top corporate executives formulate and execute corporate strategies.<P>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><a href="#top">Back to the top of the page.</a><hr></BLOCKQUOTE>


<a name="C"><H3>Professional Investing</H3></a><P>

Every Friday afternoon, it's the same. The roar of trading fades, and institutional investors start readying themselves for Monday morning's bell. Their preparation starts on Saturday morning, in the reflective calm home offers, with Barron's.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
 
Why do they read Barron's? Because Barron's covers what and how much money is going into which markets, sectors, industries and companies...and also tells them why. The result? The edge they need to succeed in the complex, fast-paced financial markets of today.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><a href="#top">Back to the top of the page.</a><hr></BLOCKQUOTE>


<a name="D"><H3>Personal Investments</H3></a><P>

Desire is what the markets are all about. The desire to discover value overlooked by others and to convert value over time to profit. Smart readers come to Barron's to find value...and to arm themselves against the predations and pitfalls of the marketplace. And it seems to have worked. The numbers tell the story of Barron's readers' affluence and success.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> 99.4% of readers own securities. <P>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> Their average portfolio value is $1,365,000. <P>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> 97.3% use a broker. <P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

When the subjects are money and markets, nobody covers them better than Barron's. Stocks and bonds, commodities and financial futures, mutual funds and real estate -- whenever people are investing money, Barron's covers the potential risks... and the very possible rewards.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><a href="#top">Back to the top of the page.</a><hr></BLOCKQUOTE>



<a name="E"><H3>Computer Use</H3></a><P>

Daily, the world gets more complex as technology changes the face of business and finance. But Barron's readers are on the leading edge of that change. They are connected to the global information network, both at home on their own personal computers and at work, where they spend an average of 18 hours a week in front of their computer screens. They access on-line services, surveying all there is to offer from this new frontier. And they use the latest and most sophisticated financial software available.<P>

Here are some compelling reasons why the Barron's audience is attractive to high-tech advertisers:<P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> 69.5% have a personal computer at home.<P> 
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> Home computers are used for both business (73.5%) and personal (93.8%) reasons.<P>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> 80.1% use their home computers for financial purposes.<P> 
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> 87.0% use a computer at work.<P>

<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> 62.6% use on-line services.<P>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> Top software applications used: financial, word processing, spreadsheet.<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>


Barron's readers use technology as a tool to help them prosper today and in the future. And they read Barron's to help them apply the tools of technology intelligently...and profitably.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><a href="#top">Back to the top of the page.</a><hr></BLOCKQUOTE>




<a name="F"><H3>Travel</H3></a><P>

Affluent individuals and important corporate executives are the two most valuable targets of the travel industry. The former's wealth allows them lavish vacations, while the latter's jobs necessitate frequent travel. Barron's offers a high concentration of both groups, making it a superlative medium for travel advertisers. <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> 83.2% of readers traveled domestically in the past year. <P>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> 52.9% of domestic travelers flew for business reasons, and 73.1% flew for vacation/personal reasons. <P>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> 62.6% traveled overseas in the past three years.<P> 
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> 32.8% of foreign travelers flew for business reasons, and 55.1% flew for vacation/personal reasons. <P>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> 20.7% took a cruise in the past three years.<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Every week, Barron's offers an intelligent recap of what happened in the financial markets, and a sophisticated look forward at what's likely to occur there. It's this knowledge that propels our readers up the economic ladder, into the boardroom and the executive suite...and to travel destinations domestic and abroad.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><a href="#top">Back to the top of the page.</a><hr></BLOCKQUOTE>




<a name="G"><H3>Purchasing Patterns and Power</H3></a><P>

Accumulated wealth allows Barron's readers to spend as they wish. And spend they do. These affluentials purchase all of the finer things in life -- furs, jewelry, artwork and collectibles -- as well as the items necessary to the business professional -- suits, dress shoes and accessories.<P>

In the past year, <BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> 35.3% of readers purchased fine jewelry with an average value of $2,989. <P>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> 64.9% purchased men's suits/sport coats and accessories (average value -- $1,236). <P>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> 45.6% purchased leather goods (average value -- $702). <P>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> 25.9% purchased a watch (average value -- $1,237). <P>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> 26.9% purchased artwork/collectibles (average value -- $4,483).<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Every week, Barron's readers are the first to discover the important financial news likely to affect their investments. This first-hand information allows them to acquire and maintain wealth. This ongoing process of wealth creation allows them to spend as they choose.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><a href="#top">Back to the top of the page.</a><hr></BLOCKQUOTE>



<a name="H"><H3>Public/Leisure Activities</H3></a><P>

Every week, Barron's reports on finance and covers who won, who lost and, yes, how the game was played. And while our readers regularly play the markets, they also enjoy a variety of outdoor and cultural activities.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> 90.1% of readers participate in sports activities. <P>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> 62.6% attended a sporting event in the past year. <P>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> 65.0% attended the theatre in the past year.<P> 
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> 76.4% belong to a private club.<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR><BR>
These influentials also shape the opinions of others.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> 38.0% are involved in environmental/civic/social issues. <P>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> 35.6% gave a speech/addressed a public meeting.<P>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> 25.4% engaged in fund raising.<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

As athletes train to achieve peak performance, so must market players work to achieve real value. At Barron's, our mission is to keep investors on their toes to assure competitive performance in the markets. But they keep themselves physically active, while actively shaping public opinion.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><a href="#top">Back to the top of the page.</a><hr></BLOCKQUOTE>




<a name="I"><H3>Home Ownership</H3></a><P>

Their impressive personal affluence allows Barron's readers to live life to its fullest. And their homes are extensions of this upscale lifestyle -- elegant main residences of considerable value, and impressive dwellings for weekend getaways.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> 78.6% of Barron's readers live in a single-family house.<P>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> 32.5% have a seasonal/weekend residence.<P>

<STRONG>Contents
</STRONG>



<P>Barron's covers what happens when money and markets come together -- who wins, who perhaps loses, in terms of what assets (stocks, bonds, oil, gold etc.) and for what reasons.</P>



<P>What's more, Barron's explores what well may happen in the markets next, thereby arming investors for the shocks and turmoil of market battles to come and allowing them to survive -- indeed, to thrive -- as a result.</P>





<P>Financial survival and success being as highly esteemed as they are, Barron's is read intensely, cover-to-cover, week-after-week, by some of the most powerful (read &quot;rich and influential&quot;) people in the world.</P>





<P>Different parts of the publication contain different information (data, insights and ideas), expressed in different ways (feature articles, columns, Q&As, charts and tables, financial statistics etc.) on different markets, the economy, sectors and companies. Thus, how each person reads Barron's varies with each person's needs.</P>





<P>But there's one constant among all these readers: It is the remarkable <EM>utility </EM>of Barron's that they value most -- the fact that Barron's gives them immediately useful information that they can (almost literally) take to the bank.</P><BR>





<STRONG>Parts of the Whole</STRONG><!-- Horizontal Line Tag -->
<HR>




<P><EM>Barron's</EM> is made up of two distinct parts -- a center pullout section called &quot;Market Week,&quot; and the pages that wrap around this center section and that we call (quite naturally enough) &quot;The Wrap.&quot;</P>





<P><STRONG>The Wrap</STRONG>  contains the cover story, feature stories, the weekly Q&A, some regular columns, the departments and the editorial material.</P>





<P><STRONG>Market Week</STRONG> covers the previous week's market activities in detail with columns that focus on specific markets, the comprehensive statistics in the financial pages, and the final eight pages of market data and macroeconomic data known as the &quot;Market Lab.&quot;</P>





<P>Barron's editorial perspective is to look back at what happened in the markets, and then to project forward to what may happen next. So the physical makeup of the publication mirrors our editorial focus:</P>




<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> an inner pullout that chronicles the markets' activities for the previous week and<BR><BR>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> an outer wrap whose articles, columns and departments explore the possibilities (good, bad and indifferent) for the economy, sectors, companies and investment categories.
<BR>
<BR>





<P><STRONG>I. <EM>The Wrap</EM></STRONG> contains, on any given week, the following material in this usual order of appearance through the publication:</P>




<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"><STRONG> Up & Down Wall Street</STRONG>, by Alan Abelson. This legendary Wall Street wise man offers his witty and often controversial opinions on business, financial, economic and political news and events and analyzes moves in specific stocks.<BR><BR>

<BR><BR>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"><STRONG> Insider Transactions.</STRONG> An insider is any officer, director or owner of 10% or more of a class of a company's securities. An insider must report to the SEC, by the 10th of the month following a trade, any transaction that he or she has engaged in. The Insider Transactions table shows the largest dollar value transactions reported to the SEC for a specified period. Heavy sales might indicate that the insiders are pessimistic about the company's prospects; heavy purchases might indicate an optimistic outlook.
<BR><BR>

The practice of environmental marketing by many national brand companies
from 1990 to the present has been unsuccessful. In fact, most &quot;green&quot;
products and services designed and promoted primarily for their environmental
benefits have failed. The reason for their failure is embarrassingly simple:
they did not first satisfy the basic style, performance and/or price requirements
or expectations of the mass market. <BR>
<BR>
Coddington Environmental helps businesses appropriately position product,
service and technology &quot;design-for-the-environment&quot; initiatives.
After all, the greenest products and technologies won't benefit the environment
if they don't see the light of day.

Environmental Education</CENTER>
</H4>
Getting markets to support cleaner products and technologies is firstly
a matter of educating them as to the need for and benefit of such environmentally
benign advances. Green processes and products are based (and often priced)
on environmental ethics and principles (such as eco-justice, zero waste
and sustainable development) that few end-users fully understand or empathize
with. <BR>
<BR>
Market environmental education, however, can be too time-consuming and costly
a process for one company to bear alone. Coddington Environmental, therefore,
links marketers up with programs or partners that have similar educational
goals and similar target audiences. These partners bring additional personpower,
expertise and financial resources to the table.

It's not what you say about yourself that is most believable, it's what
others say about you.<BR>
Coddington Environmental helps clients identify widely respected environmental
advocates and other third party authorities who want to work with environmentally-
and socially-responsible corporations. <BR>

<H1><CENTER>Alternative Combustion Engineering (ACE) </CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><HR><B>ARRAY POPPET VALVE SYSTEM<BR>
for the internal combustion engine<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Executive Summary </B></CENTER>
<P><HR><BR>
<P><CENTER><B>Background</B></CENTER>
<P>The internal combustion engine (for cars, trucks, lawn mowers, motorcycles,
etc.) breathes in air and exhales exhaust. To operate efficiently, an internal
combustion engine must breathe efficiently. The more air received by each
engine cylinder during the combustion process, the more completely the fuel
will be burned, thereby reducing the cost of fuel and reducing the amount
of toxic emissions.<BR>
<BR>
The purpose of the ACE Array Poppet Valve System is to improve the performance
of the inlet valves that allow air to enter into the engine cylinders during
the combustion process. In particular, the ACE Valve System greatly improves
the efficiency of a standard internal combustion engine by increasing the
volume of air entering an engine cylinder. It does so by enlarging the amount
of inlet opening area available when air is transferred into the cylinder.<BR>
<BR>
The increase in engine operational efficiency results in better gas mileage,
lower operating cost and a much cleaner burning engine, thereby, reducing
air pollution. <BR>
<BR>
Most car engines have one inlet valve per cylinder to allow air entry into
the engine. Some higher performance cars and race cars have as many as two
inlet valves for air entry into the engine. The ACE Array Poppet Valve System
uses three to four valves (as a clustered group) designed to allow more
air into the cylinder. This results in what is called an increase in volumetric
efficiency, which merely means that there is more air available inside any
given cylinder during engine operation.<BR>
<P><CENTER><B>The ACE Array Poppet Valve System</B></CENTER>
<P>The innovative ACE Array Poppet Valve System narrows the extended intake
event while simultaneously increasing the amount of air and fuel within
an engine's cylinder head having the same limitation of 45% valve diameter
to bore diameter. This has been accomplished through miniaturization and
multiplication of valves.<BR>
<BR>
ACE has developed four miniature valves about the axis of the port's entry
into the combustion chamber. These valves are sized to one-half the diameter
of the standard single valve they replace. The Array Poppet Valve System
is seated with four one-half size valves, each having one-quarter the area
as the standard valve they replaced. The value of the Array Poppet Valve
System is that the combined circumferences of the four mini valves equate
to twice the circumference of the standard valve they replace. As a result,
only one-half the previously required valve lift distance is now required.
<BR>
<P><CENTER><B>Utilization of the ACE Array Poppet Valve System to Improve
Engine Efficiency</B></CENTER>
<P>When the piston reaches top dead center (TDC) the Array Valve window
will be the same size as the standard valve would have been, except the
valve has been lifted off its valve seat 4.5 degrees later. The result is
less contamination of exhaust and intake gases during the valve overlap
period and improved emissions due to decrease in the valve overlap period.
A second point of improvement is the fully open window of environment (maximum
valve lift ) occurs earlier during the intake valve event to compliment
the maximum piston velocity period, resulting in improved filling of the
cylinder.<BR>
<P><CENTER><B>Single Cylinder Engines</B></CENTER>
<P>There are many inherent differences between single cylinder engines and
multiple cylinder engines. Single cylinder engines are designed as high
output engines in order to have positive horsepower to size ratios. One
difference is that the inlet valve opens 30 degrees before TDC, not 9 degrees,
and stays open 70 degrees after BDC (actually a portion of the compression
stroke) in order to have a very effective intake event (approximately 40
percent of the complete engine cycle). Incoming air and fuel is contaminated
by and mixed with the exhaust gases exiting due to the extended exhaust
and intake valve overlap at TDC. Fuel and air contained within the cylinder
after BDC expel due to the piston actually being in an effective velocity
during the early portion of the compression stroke, creating back pressure
in the direction of the carburetor while the intake valve is still open.
Consequently, single cylinder, high output engines create unacceptable emissions
and fuel consumption. <BR>
<BR>
The ACE Array Poppet Valve System can greatly improve the performance of
single cylinder engines by reducing emissions and improving fuel efficiency.
The ACE System also allows the engine to run more smoothly, thereby reducing
the wear and fatigue brought about by excessive single cylinder engine operating
vibration.<BR>
<BR>
The ACE Array Poppet Valve System technology can be readily adapted to conventional
internal combustion engines without major changes in engine design. <BR>
<BR>
The multiple valve technology described herein is covered by U.S. and foreign
patents.

<P><CENTER><HR><B>PATENTED HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL TECHNOLOGY<BR>
<BR>
Executive Summary<BR>
</B><HR><B>Background</B></CENTER>
<P>The major problem today regarding all kinds of combustion is the pollutants
in the exhaust gases. Burning oil, coal or urban waste causes unacceptable
emissions and restrictions are increasing all over the world. The most common
way of solving the problem is to add cleaning processes for specified, single
pollutants, but these systems are expensive and far from 100% effective.
Another way is to use clean fuels, but this is also very expensive.<BR>
<P><CENTER><B>The BAL System</B></CENTER>
<P>Invented in Sweden, the BAL hazardous waste disposal system is the most
effective and economical alternative to reducing exhaust gas emissions.
It virtually eliminates air pollution associated with combustion resulting
in the cleanest exhaust gas possible, almost regardless of what is being
burned.<BR>
<BR>
The BAL system is based upon a very simple principle: Any gas will condense
if the temperature is reduced to a low enough level. The BAL system reduces
the temperature of exhaust gases down to -50&#176;C to -75&#176;C (-65&#176;F
to -110&#176;F). At this very low temperature, most of the gaseous pollutants
condense together with residual water, which forms a sort of &quot;dirty
snow.&quot; The patented BAL system cools the gas by expanding it through
a reverse screw-compressor, thus eliminating the icing problems and high
costs associated with traditional cooling equipment. The residual snow is
then collected and formed into a solid waste that can be dumped without
environmental risks. <BR>
<BR>
The BAL method is essentially a four-step process: 1) pressurizing the gas/air;
<BR>
2) cooling the gas; 3) expanding the gas; and 4) separating the snow.<BR>
<BR>
BAL plants have been in operation since 1985. Tests with exhaust gases from
combustion of urban waste have shown results far below any country's limitations.<BR>
<BR>
Today, BAL offers a plant for combustion of fluid fuels at a size of 5 MW.
This plant is especially well suited for fluid hazardous waste, such as
oil industry waste, PCB-containing oils, ClHC, waste from agricultural chemicals,
plastics, etc. <BR>
<BR>
The BAL process is covered by worldwide patents.

<P><CENTER><HR><B>PATENTED CO-COMPOSTING TECHNOLOGY<BR>
for municipal solid waste and sewage sludge<BR>
<BR>
Executive Summary</B><BR>
<HR><B>Background </B></CENTER>
<P>Today, biodegradable organic materials make up more than 60% of the typical
municipal solid waste (MSW) stream. Mounting federal and state recycling
and waste diversion mandates along with increasing costs of siting new landfills
and disposing of sewage sludge, have made composting an economically, as
well as environmentally, sound alternative for municipal waste management
plans in virtually any size community.<BR>
<P><CENTER>BBC's Patented Co-Composting Technology</CENTER>
<P>Bedminster Bioconversion Corporation (BBC), with its patented and proven
technology, converts municipal solid waste (MSW) and municipal sewage sludge
(MSS) to high quality, highly marketable compost within to three to nine
days.<BR>
<BR>
The heart of the Bedminster system is the patented Eweson&reg; (pronounced
Av-e-son) digester, a compartmentalized rotary cylinder that provides the
ideal conditions for rapid microbial activity, accelerating the natural
decomposition of all biodegradable materials into exceptional quality compost.
The benefits of Bedminster's Organagro&reg; compost have been verified by
university research. With an operating facility in Big Sandy, Texas since
1972, Bedminster now has over 20 years of co-composting experience.<BR>
<BR>
The Bedminster system is the world's leading technology for composting both
MSW and sewage sludge. The aerobic, in-vessel process and enclosed facility,
equipped with a complete air treatment system, eliminate odor problems and
prevent air, water or soil pollution. <BR>
<BR>
BBC has presently 3 plants in operation, 3 plants under construction and
licensing agreements in Sweden and Australia.

<P><CENTER><HR><B>PATENTED ORGANIC FERTILIZER PELLETIZATION TECHNOLOGY <BR>
<BR>
Executive Summary<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</B><HR><B>Background</B></CENTER>
<P>There is pressure from two sides driving the use of organic fertilizers.
One by the necessity of communities to solve their waste problems and another
by the increasing understanding of the importance of organic fertilizers.
<BR>
<BR>
The presence of organic matter, after all, is what distinguishes soil from
desert and enables the soil to sustain crop growth. Long-term sole use of
chemical fertilizers strips the soil of this necessary organic matter resulting
in a decrease in crop production and a host of other unexpected negative
environmental consequences. <BR>
<BR>
We are moving toward a situation where at least 30 percent of the total
fertilizer used will be of organic origin. And this is why organic fertilizers
must be developed to levels appropriate for modern handling and distribution
techniques.<BR>
<P><CENTER><B>Enter VNP: Organic Fertilizer Pelletization</B></CENTER>
<P>VNP is produced from a composted and hygienized mixture of organic waste
(e.g., sewage sludge, animal manure), a carbon source (e.g., municipal waste,
vegetable waste, barch, peat), and additional nutrients and trace elements.
The mixture is then compressed into high-density pellets (5-10 mm in diameter
and 10-15 mm in length) with dry substance of 85 to 90 percent. The pellets
supplied to the soil have the following important characteristics:<BR>
<BR>
&#183; high bacteriological activity<BR>
&#183; high water retention<BR>
&#183; plant nutrients in a form available to the roots of the plant<BR>
&#183; long-term nutrient effect.<BR>
<BR>
VNP can be produced from any organic waste and carbon source yielding the
appropriate composition of the macronutrients nitrogen, phosphor, and potassium
and micronutrients such as calcium, magnesium, sulfur, copper, zinc, manganese,
iron, and boron.<BR>
<BR>
The VNP concept was developed in cooperation with the Swedish Agricultural
University and has been extensively tested and proven in laboratory and
open field conditions.

<BR>
Walter Coddington is the president of Coddington Environmental Management
(CEM), the first environmental marketing consultancy in the United States
dedicated to helping businesses, governmental agencies and environmental
organizations develop and promote environmentally responsible policies,
products, technologies and educational programs. Since its formation in
1990, CEM has served the ARM &amp; HAMMER&reg; products company, Weyerhaeuser,
Miller Brewing, Benckiser, General Electric Plastics, Pepsi USA, Seagrams,
Young &amp; Rubicam, United States Department of Agriculture, US Environmental
Protection Agency, United Nations Environment Programme, United Nations
Population Fund, The Aspen Institute, National Wildlife Federation, National
Audubon Society and many others. <BR>
<BR>
In 1993, McGraw-Hill, a leading publisher of marketing and environmental
management books, published Walter Coddington's comprehensive textbook Environmental
Marketing. Subtitled Positive Strategies for Reaching the Green Consumer,
the work examines how companies can profit from environmental stewardship.
Many of the strategies recommended can be employed by marketers in any part
of the world, consequently, the book has shown up in classrooms as diverse
as those in Northern California and South Korea.<BR>
<BR>
In 1994, Mr. Coddington co-founded with Mr. Claes Nobel of the Swedish Nobel
Prize family, The Claes Nobel Institute for Environmental Technologies.
The Institute provides emerging environmental technology companies with
financial and global marketing assistance. <BR>
<BR>
Walter Coddington specializes in structuring and managing public/private
partnership programs that stimulate social, environmental and economic development
at a community level. One such program is the En-Graffiti pilot in New York
City's Borough of Queens. En-Graffiti has proved to be the Salvation Army's
most successful job training program helping homeless veterans transition
back into mainstream society. In addition, it has helped the corporate partner,
the ARM &amp; HAMMER baking soda company, open new markets for its environmental
technologies and products.

   <img src="../Icons2/Balls/rd_ball.gif">
   Objective of the Study 
</h2>
<ul>
<p>
   Recently Large  amount of  spatial data have  been easily  handled due to the significant increase in the computing speed and memory space of workstations and, development of input devices such as scanners, digitizers and storage media such as optical disks.<br>
  The  developed  countries  such as  USA  and  Germany  have  been  using  Geo graphic Information Systems(GIS) which  can manipulate data collection, update, analysis ,  display and data management  in terrain analysis.   Our military forces, having  relatively less computing power, need to develop their own tactical terrain analysis system.<br>
  The objective of this study is to develop a scientific tactical terrain analysis system which can combine GIS, image processing and graphics technology to support field commanders who have to  set up strategic tactics  in battlefield operations.   This terrain analysis  system will reduce uncertainty in troop manenvering,  fire planning, and  communications.  The  accurate information produced  by the terrain analysis system will be able to enhance the combat capability of a military  unit and  efficiency of weapon systems  and also support military officers to make a prompt decision and operation plan. Therefore,  it is  necessary  to build  our own terrain analysis  system  that suits  to  our circumstances.  Especially,  it is important to build Korean menu driven system that can be easily utilized by military officers in operational mode.

   Objectives of the Study 
</h2>
<ul>
<p>
   The automatic  vision inspection systems  whose development was  started in e
arly  1970s are widely  used for the  industry applications such  as automobile, electrical and electronics. food and pharmacetical,  chemical and metallic, etc, in industrialized  countries. These systems are connected to  the robots and functions as robot  eyes for the process control and  product quality control  and also used  for the variety of  applications such as  judging the product's quality, inspecting  the faults  of the  product, counting  the special  features in the  product, identifying and the sorting the product, etc.
   <ul>
   The automatic vision inspection systems can:<br>
   o  eventually free the workers from simple repetitive jobs,<br>
   o  reduce the production cost,<br>
   o  replace human workers in the hostile work environment,<br>
   o  perform inspection of massively producted    commodities fast and accurately in real time fashion,<br>
   o  perform very sophistigated inspection which human workers can not perform
and thus the necessity, importance and market prospect is growing rapidly.<br><br>
   The domestic research  activity in this field has not  been much active excep
t some  basic researches performed in the universities and the large  scale research for the d evelopment and utilization of automatic vision inspection system in Korea seems to be one of the indispensible and paramount task for the immediate necessity.

   Objectives and Importance of the Study 
</h2>
<ul>
<p>
   The objectives of this study is to  develop a image processing system, for remote sensing, which  is microcomputer  based,  low-cost, user-friendly  and  easy to  use, In the  1970's, graphics terminal  connected to  the mainframe computer  was utilized. However, due to  the high-cost  of the  system,  un-user-friendliness, and  slow  turn-around it  was not widely accepted by resource managers.  Thanks to the recent technology development  in the field of IBM PC  or compatibles,  costs of  microcomputer system  and image processing  peripherals were substantially reduced  while performance and capacity have  been dramatical ly improved.
   As a result many low-cost system were developed and commercially available for the  on-site experts in national land development, resource  exploration, environmental conservation, marine and oceanic research, weather forecasting, etc. Recently  interest in  utilizing  remote sensing  technology  has been  increased in some govemment offices,  national institutes,  and universities. Some  of them  already installed an image  processing system  at their  site. Thease  system usually  have been  introduced into Korea in turn-key base. With  turn-key based system, the local maintenance of the hardware and software is very difficult even though not impossible.
   Thus  it is  very  important to  develop  a low-cost,  easy-to-use  microcomputer image processing  system  and  distribute to  the  local  remote  sensing  specialists and  resource menagers.

</h3>
</ul>

<h2>
   <img src="../Icons2/Balls/rd_ball.gif">
   Needs and Objectives 
</h2>
<ul>
<p>
   The objectives  of the present study  are 1) to investigate  the radiative characteristics  of the infrared channels on the  NOAA/AVHRR and GMS/VISSR, 2) to develop or test retrieval algorithms for  some meteorological parameters,  and 3) to develop  a workstation to  analyze meteorological satellite data.<br>
  Since  the  meteorological satellite  receiving  system  has  been operated at  the  Korea Meteorological  Service in  July,  1989,  it provides  valuable  information  for meteorological analysis and  forecasts around  the Korean  peninsula. However,  the system  was developed entirely by foreign  knowledge, it is difficult to integrate  our own knowledge by the system.  Moreover, it is  expecting that the maintenance, update, and  operation should heavily rely on the foreign supports in the future.  Therefore, the  integration of knowledge on  utilizing meteorological satellite data is urgently required.
</p>
</ul>

<h2>
   <img src="../Icons2/Balls/rd_ball.gif">
   Scope  
</h2>
<ul>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Develop  a radiative  tansfer model  that simulates  the NOAA/AVHRR  and GMS/ VISSR infrared  channel to  investigate the  radiative characteristics  of the  channe ls. Also  develop algorithms to  retrieve sea surface  temperatures and atmospheric precipitable water amounts from the channel characteristics.
<li>Test  some  algorithms  to  analyze  cloud   amounts,  cloud  heights,  and cloud  type classification.
<li>Test the algorithms to estimate the vegetation index.
<li>Investigate the  feasibilty on the application of  satellite imagery for pred icting atmospheric lightning.
<li>Investigate the data structure and application of the Space Environment Monitor.
<li>Develop a  W/S for  satellite image  processing  and application  S/W for  m eteorological parameter retrievals.
</ol>
</p>
</ul>

<h2>
   <img src="../Icons2/Balls/rd_ball.gif">
   Conclusions and Recommendations
</h2>
<ul>
<p>
   It  is  suggested  that  the radiative  transfer  model  developed  properly simulates  the NOAA/AVHRR and  GMS/VISSR infrared channels.  The characteristics of  the channe ls are mostly depend on the  amount of atmospheric water vapor and the water  vapor amo unts, the precipitable water and sea surface temperature algorithms were proposed.<br><br>
  The cloud  analyses techniques for  cloud amounts, cloud heights,  and cloud classification from satellite  images, and the  algorithm for vegetation  index has been  studi ed and tested.  The relationships among ground measurements of lightning, GMS cloud top temperat ures, and application of SEM data have been explored.<br><br>
  Meteorolgical satellite  image processing W/S  is developing  in three parts, preprocessing S/W, image processing  S/W, and analyses S/W  for meteorlogical parameters. A me thod  for geometric correction of  satellite images has been developed  as a part of prepr ocessing S/W.  Image processing S/W  is developing by modifying  the KMIPS (KIST Microcomputer Image Processing System). The  S/W for estimating cloud amounts, cloud  heights, veget ation index, and sea surface temperature have been prepared as  the S/W for methorological pa rameters in accord with the algorithms developed in this study or reported in the literature.<br><br>
   Verifications for some conclusions are required, and communications  among th e projects in this program are necessary to prepare the analysis S/W for meteorological parame ters.

   Objectives of the Study 
</h2>
<ul>
<p>
   Several industralized countries haveuntlized various  satellite imagery for many applications such  as weather  forecasting,  resource  exploration, national  land  development, crop  yield forecasting, marine and oceanic  research, etc.  The success or failure of  using these satellite imagery mainly depend on the capability of image processing software. In this context, U.S.A and Japan  started developing  image processing software  from early  1960 and there are a large number  of image processing  packages being  utilized in operational  mode.
   In  Korea, research to develop  an image processing software  has been performed sporadically, however no significant results were made  due to the lack of fund and man  power.  Korea is a small country with a  large number of population and  the use of satellite imagery  for the efficient national land  utilization, resource development,  and maximizing crop produetion  capability is indispensible.  For this purpose, a powerful image  processing software for the analysis of the remotely sensed data needs to be developed.

</h2>
<ul>
<p>
   Computerisation has opened new vistas in both documentaion and the prognoses essential to all decision-making and dissemination of information.  Since the mid 1970s, specialized computer systems have been developed to process georeferenced information in various ways.  The collective name for such systems is Geographic Information Systems, abbreviated GIS.  Traditionally,  geographic data is presented on maps using symbols,  lines and colours.  Most maps have a legend in which these geometric elements are listed and explained.<br>
   Compared to maps,  GIS has the inherent advantage that data storage and data presentation are separate.  As a result,  data may be presented and viewed in various ways.<br>
   So, the goal of the research is to develop the intelligent vector process system software for various GIS entertainment. That will be used foreign as well as domestic.

<ul>
<p>
    The goal of the research is to develop the major part of the car navigation system which consists of  the most advanced  electronic system for guiding  the optimal driving  path with analyzing informations about car location, road condition, and traffic status.<br>
  Navigation Information System(NIS) for vehicles is the system which  drivers can see the optimal driving path from the  current location to the destination by displaying map  and road information through  the LCD  display.   These NIS for  vehicles provides  the drivers  more comfortable driving environment with the  connection of the most advanced eletro nics and car engineering.<br>
  NIS  for vehicles  is a  noticeable  and a  high valued  industry  which con sists  of the Geographic Information System(GIS) technology (which is  being developed very fa st today to solve the faced social problems  such as a local unbalanced increasemant of urba n population, traffic jam, etc.), Satellite Communication, Microprocessor Production, etc.  and thus collectiong the technologies about  these fields are required  and spreading effects to  other related fields are also expected.<br>
  Today,  the increment  of cars  and  bad road  condition  produces social  problems like economical loss  and environmental polution  by bearing severe  traffic jam. NIS for vehicles atively deals with  these kind of problems and increase  the efficiency of road use, and  some developed countries have already made an investment related to this as as infra-structure.<br>
    NIS for  vehicles provides  beginners of  first trip  drivers an  optimal driving path  and comfortable driving environment  so that they can  drive safely, reduce the cost ,  and prevent the accident before it happens.<br>
    Car industry  tends to  be a high  ranked industy  with adding  some kinds of  eletronic devices and these NIS for vehicles is essential for the next car industry.  So the development of  this system  provides  not only  the  increment  of a  foreign  competition but  also  the protection of a domestic market.  Japan will  be expected that in 1995, there will be a market with 200 billion yen, and in Korea there  will be also a big  market as soon as it is widely used.

   Contents and Scope of the Study	  
</h2>
<ul>
<p>
    We performed the l'st  period research out of three periods  which is the basic design of driving path guiding system, and  realized the specific function which is included in the basic design.  We  developed the program of deciding  the present location and finding the optimal driving  path as  the  basic part  of the  driving  path guiding  system.   And we finished standardized sampled area map data input.  The contents and the scope of the lst period study are as follows.
    <ol>
    <li> The investigation about present NIS technique.
    <li> Basic design of a driving path guide system.
    <li> The Study of the standardization about map data
    <li> Present location decision by GPS
    <li> Development of an algorithm for the standard map image data and road data display.
    <li> Study of an algorithm about extracting the optimal driving path
    <li> Standard map image data and road data input and building a D/B of a sampl ed data
    <li> Development of an intelligent sensing and control system for a safe drive .
    </ol>
    Map data  itself can't  be used as  a path  extracting information and  additional driving information about their  driving environment.  Road data requires  constant exertions for both exrtacting the optimal driving path and guiding  the present location about drivers.  Map data and road  data require constant exertions  and time for inserting  and making data, and  they affect the  structure of the  optimal driving  path guiding system.   So in  order to join  and simplify the system design, map standardizartion and road standardization are highly required.<br>
  Present location decision  is the key element  of the automatic drive  guiding system and thus we  measured the  present car location  by GPS  sattelites.  To  do this, GPS sattelite receiving  system  is  required  and  communication  between   this  receiving system  and microprocessor is required.<br>
  We examined the  basic process for extracting the  optimal driving path and we  choosed the appropriate searching method suitable for the road condition.  It is required that how well we can  model the appropriate searching  method according to the  complicated practical road condition, and we will  deal with this kind of research  in 2'nd period of the research  and in 1'st period, we extracted  the optimal driving path with considering  road distance, number of lane, and the coefficient of utilization.<br>
  We developed an algorythm which provides drivers data with excellent visual efficieny and it is  easy to  use and reduce  the responsibility  of the  microprocessor. Now we  developed interface  emphasised display  module with  the  use of  MS-WINDOWS which  is  used as GUI(Graphical User  Interface) environment  in personal  computer. We  made that a car  is always located in center of the monitor  by organizing the map as four pieced images so that it can be possible to display a real time display which doesn't disturb the drivers' eye<br>
  We added a process of  driving locus trace and inserted the important location information in Daejeon area in addition.

   The results of the Study 
</h2>
<ul>
<p>
   We developed  the techniques of  basic elements about  the data  standardization with the decision of  present locaion,data  display and the  optimal driving  path extraction. The  more specific explanations about those are as follows.
<br><br>
1. Investigation of present car navigation information system status
   <ul>
   o Japan, USA, etc
   </ul>
2. Basic design of the car navigation information system
   <ul>
   o hardware
      <ul>
      - portable computer<br>
        (486DX-33, TFT 9" momitor, 180M removable HDD)<br>
      - GPS receiver(TransPakll GPS Personal Navigator)<br>
      </ul>
   o software
      <ul>
      - map data standardization<br>
      - decision of present location by GPS system<br>
      - map data display<br>
      - optimal driving path finding and guidance<br>
      </ul>
   </ul>
3. Parts of map data standardization
   <ul>
   o current status in other countries.
      <ul>
      - USA : study about map data standardization in SAE and SDTS<br>
      - Germany : Travelpilot Database construction status<br>
      - Japan :  status about map data standardization and  database constructio n in JDRMA<br>
      </ul>
   o study about the map image data standardization
      <ul>
      - input contrast and emphasis<br>
      - geometric correction<br>
      </ul>
   o study about the road data standardization
      <ul>
      - input the road data by digitizing<br>
      - make a topological network<br>
      - define and input the attributes about road information<br>
      </ul>
   </ul>
4. Parts of deciding the present location
   <ul>
   o location decision by GPS<br>
   o development of the GPS signal sending/receiving program<br>
   </ul>
5. Program development about 1 second-interval real time map data display<br>
6. Implementation of the optimal driving path program which can be obstacle addable<br>
7. Parts of building the D/B of a sample area
   <ul>
   o building the image D/B about Daejeon area
      <ul>
      - 1 : 25,000 scale map[Keumnam, Sintanjin, Yuseong, Daejeon]<br>
      - 1 : 50,000 scale map[Daejeon]<br>
      - resolution 200dpi, 1,200 x 1,440(col x row), 16 color<br>
      - 45 files(1:25,000 36 files, 1:50,000 9 files)<br>
      - 1,200 x 1,440 x 4 bits = 6,912,000 bits = 864,000 bytes<br>
      </ul>
   o input the road data and building the D/B about Daejeon area
      <ul>
      - 1 : 25,000 scale map<br>
      - using the PC ARC/INFO system<br>
      </ul>
   </ul>

8. Parts of developing an intelligent sensing and control system for a safe drive.<br>
9. The others
   <ul>
   o tracing the navigation locus and display<br>
   o data input about the important facilities and D/B construction<br>
   </ul>
<br>
   We performed  the basic system  design which includes the  key functions needed  as car driving guide system, and realized the main  functions. We expect that with the result of this research, it can be commercialized whithin 2'nd or 3'rd period the research.<br>
  But in  order to manimize  the efficiency of the  result of this  study, government leading teamwork and  investment should be  considered for D/B  construction of  the whole country using large  scale map,  operating a traffic  information broadcasting for collecting real  time road information, and etc.

<H2>Welcome to the Center for Transportation Research</H2>
</CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<B>Mission</B>
<P>
The Center for Transportation Research (CTR) evaluates the effects of federal transportation policies and examines the prospects for new transportation technologies.  Economic modeling and engineering are the foundation of the Center's work.  The Center plays a prominent role in the national laboratories' technical support for the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles.  Other current projects include the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Testing the feasibility of alternative-fueled vehicles (ethanol, methanol, and natural gas),</LI>
<LI>Investigating the potential for oxygen enrichment for both diesel and spark-ignition engines,</LI>
<LI>Conducting experiments on novel methods for controlling nitrogen oxides (NOx),</LI>
<LI>Developing engineering research competitions for university students to build hybrid-electric vehicles,</LI>
<LI>Conducting assessments of lightweight materials in automobiles, and</LI>
<LI>Evaluating the energy and environmental implications of a renewable oxygenate standard for reformulated gasoline. </LI>
</UL>
<P>
The Center is organized into three sections:  
<UL>
<LI>Technology Engineering
<LI>Environmental and Economic Assessments
<LI>Advanced Systems.
</UL>
The Socio-Economic Research Program is also featured in this summary. 
<P>
<P>
<B>BACKGROUND AND MISSION</B>
<P>
The transportation research program operates with a well-defined mission:  to provide the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and others with an independent evaluation of the impacts of technological change in the transportation sector and, where appropriate, provide research and development to overcome technical obstacles.  The transportation research staff conducts fuels and engine research; economic and environmental assessments, for instance, of lightweight materials such as aluminum, magnesium, and composites; and analyses and experimental research on advanced transportation concepts (such as magnetic levitation).  
<P>
The Center for Transportation Research has extensive experience in analyzing both passenger and freight transportation systems and the impacts of new technologies and changes in government policies.  To aid in this analysis, Center staff have developed computer models, with extensive peer review, to project transportation energy use and pollutant emissions for all transport modes.
<P>
Transportation energy use is particularly important for the following reasons:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Transportation is almost entirely dependent on oil,
<LI>Almost two-thirds of all oil is used for transportation, and
<LI>Petroleum use in the transportation sector alone now exceeds domestic oil production.
</UL>
<P>
<P>
Exploring new ways to improve transportation energy efficiency is not only beneficial because of the dwindling supply of U.S. oil resources and the balance-of-payments effects of imported oil, but is always critical when world oil supplies are unexpectedly interrupted.  
<P>
The staff consists of researchers in such fields as mechanical and chemical engineering, physics, environmental sciences, geography, and economics.  Augmenting the regular staff are special term appointees (from universities and the private sector) who work on an as-needed basis, as well as staff from other sections/teams in the Energy Systems Division and other divisions at Argonne.  In addition, when the research project's objective is to ensure technology development capability within industry, the Center will contract a substantial portion of the research to the private sector.<BR>

<B>INTRODUCTION</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
It's a fact.  As private R&D funding decreases, more and more U.S. companies are leveraging their research dollars by working with the nation's network of federally funded laboratories.  
<P>
Forget what you've heard in the past about working with government agencies.  As the nation's priorities have switched from developing weapons systems to ensuring economic security, technology transfer has become a top priority for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and its laboratories and facilities.  Increased U.S. technological competitiveness is the destination.  Effective working partnerships between industry and government are paving the way.  
<P>
At DOE's Argonne National Laboratory, the Energy Systems (ES) Division is strongly committed to a revitalized national economic competitiveness.  The Division's long history of industrial partnerships provides a strong customer-focus for its research.  Cost-effective, practical solutions are developed to solve real problems and meet real needs.  Economic and market evaluations are key considerations, not afterthoughts.  Timeliness and responsiveness are the Division's operating characteristics.  
<P>
ES scientists and engineers are experienced in tailoring research programs for a broad base of industries, including the oil, natural gas, railroad, automotive, textile, electric utility, primary and secondary metals, chemical, and pulp and paper industries.  Additionally, ES routinely "teams" with professional staff from other Argonne divisions or other national labs and universities when additional capabilities or expertise are needed to solve an industry problem.
<P>
The Division's unique technical resources, expertise, and facilities are focused on: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Developing tomorrow's manufacturing processes
<LI>Controlling environmental impacts of industrial energy use
<LI>Recovering valuable products from industrial waste
<LI>Developing new feedstocks and products
<LI>Reclaiming natural resources and restoring environmental quality
<LI>Designing 21st century transportation
</UL>
<P>
This website provides a brief overview of the Energy Systems Division's research and development efforts and capabilities.  The Division is committed to partnering with companies of all sizes in transferring its ideas, concepts, designs, expertise, technologies and research results.

<LI><A HREF="../htmls/sensor.html"><H3><I>Intelligent</I> Gas Microsensor</H3></A>
Argonne National Laboratory has developed a small electrocatalytic microsensor made of ceramic-metallic (cermet) materials that identifies many different gases by their electrical signatures.  The microsensor relies on an innovative combination of cermet materials, cyclic voltammetry, and neural network signal processing.  Work is under way to train the sensor to differentiate gases in mixtures and to evaluate its performance.</LI>
<P>

<LI><A HREF="../htmls/idlams.html"><H3>Natural Systems Modeling</H3></A>
The Integrated Dynamic Landscape Analysis and Modeling System (IDLAMS) is an integration of ecological models, decision support techniques, and a geographic information system (GIS) that incorporates remote sensing and field inventory data.  Based on Department of Defense (DoD) user requirements, the project objective is to create a methodology and develop a decision-support system that will link the site military mission with the planning needs for biological conservation and resource management on DoD installations.</LI>
<P>

<LI><A HREF="../htmls/plastics.html"><H3>Plastics Recovery</H3></A>
Through collaborative research with industry, Argonne National Laboratory is developing a process for recovering valuable individual plastics from the non-metallic fractions generated by appliance shredding operations.  Further, to enhance the market penetration of recycled plastic materials, cost-effective methods for improving the performance of the recovered plastics is being developed.</LI>
<P>

<LI><A HREF="../htmls/rma.chem.html"><H3>Treating Agent-Contaminated Soils</H3></A>
Soils contaminated by chemical warfare agents pose a unique remediation problem for military installations.  Argonne, a pioneer in studying the problem of agent-contaminated soils, is evaluating different treatment technologies for treating such soils at Rocky Mountain Arsenal.  The chemical warfare agents most likely to be encountered at the Arsenal are the blister agents, mustard and lewisite, and the nerve agents, GB and VX.  Success in identifying effective remediation technologies will pave the way for full-scale treatment of the Arsenal's agent-contaminated soil and may also have applicability to other kinds of contamination problems.</LI>
<P>

<LI><A HREF="../htmls/emissions2.html"><H3>Reduced NOx Emissions</H3></A>
Argonne National Laboratory has developed a new method for after-treatment of NOx in the exhaust whereby monatomic nitrogen plasma is used.  The new method should make oxygen enrichment applicable during the entire driving cycle.  Monatomic nitrogen, however, is unstable and cannot be stored.  As part of its work on applying oxygen-enriched air to internal combustion engines, Argonne investigated the use of membrane separation.  Research results suggest that the membrane "waste stream," which contains nitrogen-enriched air, could be used as feedstock for producing monatomic nitrogen.</LI>

<PRE><H2>   Welcome to the Center for Environmental Restoration Systems</H2></PRE><P>
</CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<B>BACKGROUND</B>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, Argonne National Laboratory has demonstrated a successful track record in completing large and complex programs to solve difficult environmental issues over a wide range of circumstances.  The Center for Environmental Restoration Systems (CERS), operating within Argonne's Energy Systems Division, performs research, development, and demonstration programs to attain all aspects of environmental restoration from start to finish, including site characterization, selection and implementation of remediation technologies for site cleanup, and final restoration of a site to usefulness.
<P>
The ultimate goal of the Center is to put the research results into practice.  Sponsors and industry users who have already benefitted from the Center's knowledge and technologies include the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), Gas Research Institute (GRI), and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI).  For instance, Center staff tackled research problems associated with the coal mining industry, funded by the DOE in the 1970s; pipeline right-of-way research, sponsored by GRI from 1982 to present; and rehabilitation of training areas and hazardous waste sites for the U.S. Army from 1983 to today.
<P>
<P>
<B>MISSION AND GOALS</B>
<P>
The Center for Environmental Restoration Systems' mission is to develop and perform research, development, and demonstration programs to support the complete environmental restoration process, from start to finish, addressing each of the three stages of the process, and to transfer the knowledge and technologies obtained to sponsors and other potential users of that information.
<P>
The following five goals constitute the Center's mission:
<UL>
<LI>Research, develop, evaluate, and demonstrate innovative and improved methods, techniques, and technologies to characterize all aspects of highly disturbed and/or contaminated facilities, sites, ecosystems, and landscapes.</LI>
<LI>Design and implement laboratory and field research programs to develop, evaluate, and/or demonstrate improved and more effective or 			efficient methods, systems, or technologies to clean up or remediate hazardous and/or toxic materials within the environment.</LI>
<LI>Research, develop, demonstrate, and implement improved and effective methods and technologies to reclaim, remediate, or restore to a sustainable and intended end use disturbed sites resulting from site remediation activities, production and transportation of energy and/or energy and mineral resources, military activities, or other causes.</LI>
<LI>Determine, evaluate, or predict the environmental effects and/or consequences of past, ongoing, or planned military activities; energy production, development, or transportation projects; or other similar or related actions; and identify, 	develop, test, and/or demonstrate under laboratory and field conditions promising techniques or technologies with which to mitigate consequent, deleterious environmental impacts.</LI>
<LI>Develop, demonstrate, implement, and maintain state-of-the-art scientific, engineering, and technical knowledge, skills, tools, capabilities, and resources necessary to perform or to support all research, development, and demonstration 	activities supporting the Center's mission and goals.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<B>AVAILABLE RESOURCES</B>
<P>
The Center's mission is accomplished by using the diverse staff resources available within the Center, in collaboration with other individuals, programs, and organizations within Argonne's Energy Systems Division, the Laboratory, other R&D organizations, academia, or the private sector.  Approximately 100 skilled scientists and engineers staff the Center.  To further leverage its resources, the staff partners with more than 400 other technical experts active in the environmental arena throughout the Laboratory.
<P>
The CERS staff encompasses a wide range of expertise and disciplines, including engineering; hydrology; geology, geophysics, and geochemistry; soil science and agronomy; aquatic and terrestrial ecology; organic, inorganic, and analytical chemistry; and social sciences, policy, and legal experts.
<P>
When addressing an environmental challenge, the Center's staff takes a multidisciplinary team approach, tailored specifically to the needs of the problem.  The teams focus on arriving at practical, cost-effective engineering, scientific, and technical solutions to resolve environmental issues in a timely manner.
<P>
<P>
<B>TEAMWORK</B>
<P>
Five teams operate within the Center: 
<UL>
<LI>Environmental Chemistry,
<LI>Ecology and Natural Resources,
<LI>Geosciences,
<LI>Engineering and Technology Evaluation, and
<LI>Land Reclamation.
</UL>
<P>
Fundamental team objectives include collaboration and mutual support of existing projects and in developing new programs.  Considerable cooperation and interchange between teams occurs to meet individual project, program, and Center research and development goals, objectives, and needs.
<P>
The <B>Environmental Chemistry Team</B> studies the fate of chemical pollutants in the environment.  To do this, several different chemistry disciplines are involved, including analytical, physical, inorganic, and organic chemistry, as well as biochemistry.  The <B>Ecology and Natural Resources Team </B> evaluates the impact of human activities on natural biological systems.  Team members have been involved in research projects located throughout North America and in some foreign countries.  The <B>Geosciences Team</B> supports shallow subsurface studies at federal, state, and private facilities in the United States and overseas.  Studies are undertaken to define the geological framework, hydrostratigraphy, and extent of contamination in both terrestrial and near-shore environments.  
<P>
The <B>Engineering and Technology Evaluation Team </B>evaluates treatment technologies under both laboratory and field scales and conditions.  Team members have performed projects at major military facilities contaminated with a range of toxic and hazardous materials.  This team is developing strong expertise in the safe and effective decontamination and demolition of engineered structures and facilities that are suspected of being contaminated.  Finally, the <B>Land Reclamation Team</B> develops innovative techniques and approaches to restore highly disturbed sites and landscapes to productive use.  Members of this team have successfully restored large ares severely degraded by such activities as surface mining, large-scale construction operations, and major military maneuvers and training exercises.
<P>
<P>
<B>LABORATORIES / EQUIPMENT</B>
<P>
Specialized field equipment includes a soil exploration drilling rig, a complete array of geophysical equipment, a mobile laboratory with gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer, and three 4WD field vehicles.
<P>
The Center houses several specialized laboratories: 
<UL>
<LI>Environmental Analysis/Laboratory,
<LI>Chemical Research and Technology Evaluation Laboratories,</LI>
<LI>Land Resources Analysis Laboratory, and
<LI>Field Analytical Laboratory.
</UL>
<P>
The <B>Environmental Analysis/Laboratory</B> has served the analytical needs of ES Division research since 1985 by providing physical and chemical analysis of soil, water, and plant material.  All sample preparations necessary before analysis are performed in the lab before any analytical work is initiated.
<P>
The Center possesses two chemistry laboratories: the <B>Technology Evaluation Laboratory</B> and the <B>Environmental Research Laboratory</B>.  The Technology Evaluation Laboratory is set up for bench-scale studies (such as solvent washing and thermal desorption).  The Environmental Research Laboratory contains a gas chromatograph and a liquid chromatograph.  Two field-ready instruments are also available: a gas chromatograph can be set up in a mobile laboratory for the remote sampling of sites, and a spectrophotometer is also available for screening purposes.
<P>
The <B>Land Resources Analysis Laboratory</B> staff uses a multidisciplinary approach to solve complex environmental and natural resources problems.  Using state-of-the-art geographic information systems, remote sensing, visual simulation, data visualization techniques, global positioning systems, and environmental modeling, the staff conducts applied research on a wide range of physical, biological, and natural resource issues.  These issues include such topics as land reclamation; natural resources and ecosystem management; site characterization; and long-term environmental management, monitoring, and mitigation strategies.
<P>
Greenhouse and plant growth facilities are particularly well suited for a variety of plant research studies.  Two recently renovated greenhouses, totaling 1,200 square feet under glass, have an attached headhouse and laboratory.  Environmental conditions in each greenhouse can be independently controlled and monitored via a central computerized control system.  Other plant research facilities include state-of-the-art hydroponic and aeroponic plant growth systems, controlled environment plant growth chambers, and space for field plots or outdoor growth facilities adjacent to the greenhouse complex.
<P>
<P>
<B>KEY CENTER RESEARCH</B>
<P>
The Center for Environmental Restoration Systems addresses diverse - and often complex - environmental problems.  Key projects are organized into five areas:  Site Restoration, Technology Evaluations, Treatability Testing, and Demonstrations,  Site Characterization,  Information Systems,  and Process and Method Development.

Improvements in Engine Combustion<BR>
</H2>


Argonne has been working with Compact Membrane Systems to develop a low-cost, permeable membrane that would separate ambient air into oxygen-rich and nitrogen-rich streams for use in engines. The membrane (about the size of an air filter) would provide an oxygen stream for the engine to improve combustion, while thenitrogen stream would be fed  into the exhaust as a plasma to reduce NOX emissions.<BR>
<P>

<H3>
For Diesel Engines:
</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Problem : Need to meet particulate and smoke emissions standards
<LI>Solution : Increasing the in-cylinder concentration of oxygen from the ambient 21% to 25% results in a reduction of almost 60% in particulate emissions at rated load conditions, while engine power output is increased by 50% with only a nominal (15%) increase in peak cylinder pressure.
</UL>

<H3>
For Alternative Fuels:
</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Problem : Air toxic emissions for alcohol fuels and low power density for natural gas engines
<LI>Solution : With 25% oxygen concentration in the cold phase, experiments show that M85 vehicles can meet CO, NMOG, NOX, and formaldehyde emission standards for TLEV and Tier II. Research also indicates that oxygen enrichment will increase the power density of vehicles powered by natural gas.
</UL>

<H3>
For Gasoline Engines:
</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Problem : High hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions during engine cold-start
<LI>Solution : Tests show that the proposed California TLEV and Tier II emission standards can be met by using 25% oxygen during the cold phase of the Federal Test Procedure.
</UL>

<H2>
Advanced Sensors for Combustion Control
</H2>

Argonne has developed an innovative electrocatalytic gas microsensor that is sturdy and inexpensive, operates at several hundred degrees Celsius, and identifies a wide variety of gases and vapors at concentrations approaching 1 ppm. The microsensor's versatility comes from an innovative use of cyclic voltammetry, neural-network signal processing, and ceramic-metallic, or cermet, materials. In principle, the microsensor can measure the concentration of any gas species that reacts with oxygen in its sensing element. The sensor system could provide real-time emission sensing and feedback for advanced combustion control.

<H2>
Control of Nitrogen Oxide Emissions
</H2>

<H3>
Using Catalysts to Control Nitrogen Oxide Emissions from Lean-Burn Engines
</H3>

In the presence of the excess oxygen found in the exhaust gas from lean-burn engines, the current generation of catalysts is unable to control NOX emissions. In partnership with the Low Emissions Partnership of the United States Council on Automotive Research, a consortium of the three major automobile manufacturers, Argonne is one of five national laboratories conducting cooperative research on catalysts for NOX control in the exhaust gas from lean-burn gasoline engines. The selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOX to nitrogen, in the presence of excess oxygen, by unburned hydrocarbons in the exhaust gas appears to be an ideal emission control scheme. The ZSM-5 zeolite charged with copper ions accomplishes this conversion with good efficiency, but it is very susceptible to long-term deactivation under engine exhaust conditions. Argonne is working to understand the factors that promote the effectiveness of this catalyst and to ascertain how they might be replicated in a more durable catalyst material. 

<H3>
Using Monatomic Nitrogen to Reduce Nitrogen Oxide in Engine Exhaust
</H3>

Historically, engine designers have had to live with the trade-offs between control of particulates and NOX in diesel engines and between NOX and fuel economy in all engines. This situation is becoming more difficult as the NOX emissions standard becomes even more stringent. Argonnes success in using monatomic nitrogen plasma to reduce NOX emissions from gasoline-fueled automotive engines (50-90% reductions of NOX have been achieved) led Caterpillar, Inc., to fund an evaluation of the concept for heavy-duty diesel engines. It is expected that data from the laboratory evaluation will guide Caterpillars decision to move this technology to the commercialization phase. A one-of-a-kind facility, the monatomic-nitrogen-generating test bench, is being used in the evaluation.

Automotive Two-Stroke Engines
</H2>
Argonne is pursuing advanced engine concepts research with Mercury Marine Division of Brunswick  Corporation (Fond du Lac, Wisconsin), a major manufacturer of two-stroke engines. The current CRADA with Mercury Marine is to conduct applied research in materials for automotive two-stroke engines. The components that have been shown to have problems in automotive applications are pistons, rings, bearings, and exhaust ports. The main engine-component stress comes from thermal loads 
caused by high temperatures encountered in the two-stroke combustion cycle. The ceramic materials development program, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), has identified a few advanced low-wear, heat-resistant materials that could be used in the form of coatings, composites, or monolithic components to handle high thermal stress.
<P> 

<HR SIZE=2 WIDTH=95%>

<H2>
Advanced Materials and Lubricants
</H2>

<IMG SRC="../jpegs/student.jpeg" ALIGN=LEFT>

Advanced engines, such as gas turbines and those fueled by diesel, will operate at elevated temperatures and pressures. These harsh conditions require improved lubricants and coatings for engine durability and reliability.

<UL>
<LI>Problem : Wear and corrosion of fuel injectors using alternative fuels, or injectors under high pressure
<LI>Solution : Argonne is working with diesel engines and gas turbines to develop processes for depositing diamond-like coatings on metallic and ceramic components.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Problem : Wear in gears, bearings, drives, and other automotive parts
<LI>Solution : A self-replenishing lubricant, boric acid, reduces friction and wear and is environmentally safe.

"Clean Diesel" Bus Technologies
</H2>
The use of alternative fuels in city buses could help transit operators meet mandated air quality regulations. However, a large
capital investment would be needed to convert the fueling infrastructure and buses. If oxygen-enrichment technology could be applied to meet air quality standards, or if a diesel-electric hybrid system were implemented, the use of these "clean diesel" buses could delay that investment for many years. The Regional Transit Authority in northern Illinois initiated a project with Argonne to evaluate the possibility of applying these technologies to Chicago Transit Authority buses. Following a limited number of engine tests and computer analyses, Argonne concluded that both concepts are practical and could result in a "clean diesel" bus that meets the mandated limits of the Clean Air Act Amendments. <Br>
<P>
Argonne staff used dedicated models to analyze the performance and emissions of a typical urban bus powered by conventional diesel fuel and an optimized diesel-electric hybrid system. The results compared favorably with published bus data.

<H2>Intelligent, Rugged Microsensor Identifies Wide Range of Gases</H2>

<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
In addition to environmental monitoring needs (such as continuous monitoring of soil contaminants and detection of greenhouse gas emissions from landfills and undisturbed ecosystems), regulation of emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and hazardous organic compounds from industrial plants is becoming more stringent, requiring operators to install emissions monitoring systems even for relatively small equipment.  Many available sensors for measuring gaseous emissions are too delicate to withstand the hostile, high-temperature,  environments found in industrial stacks, or they are not portable and involve sample collection and transportation.  These sensors can also be expensive, and their versatility and sensitivity are limited.  
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Argonne National Laboratory has developed a small electrocatalytic microsensor made of ceramic-metallic (cermet) materials that identifies many different gases by their electrical signatures.  The microsensor relies on an innovative combination of cermet materials, cyclic voltammetry, and neural network signal processing.  Work is under way to train the sensor to differentiate gases in mixtures and to evaluate it performance.  
<P>
The microsensor, produced by using thick-film screening methods, is constructed of four overlapping thick films with an incorporated thick-film heating element on the back.  As a cyclic voltage is ramped through the upper and lower electrodes, gases adsorbed on the surface react catalytically, changing the concentration of ions at the three-phase boundary between the gas, electrode, and solid electrolyte. This, in turn, changes the ionic current flow measured through the microsensor.  The applied voltage and measured current produce a voltage/current signature that is unique for each individual gase and mixture.  The microsensor's intelligent signal processing uses neural networks to recognize the gas signature patterns and quantify the gases by their shape changes.

Researchers are evaluating applications for the microsensor, including monitoring stacks and flues for gaseous emissions of regulatory concern, characterizing environmental contaminants in the field, providing early fire warning, monitoring fugitive emissions from machinery, detecting CO2 and O2 for underwater breathing apparatus, detecting CO for indoor air quality, and providing input information to process control systems.

<UL>
<LI>The microsensor's intelligent pattern recognition system can be trained to recognize a wide variety of gases and gas mixtures.</LI>
<LI>The microsensor is inexpensive to produce ( &lt  25 per microsensor ), yet it may prove rugged enough to survive in hostile, high-temperature  environments, if necessary.</LI>
<LI>The microsensor can be remotely cleaned and does not require electrolyte replenishment or replacement.</LI>
<LI>Compared with conventional sensors, power requirements are low (milliwatts).</LI>
<LI>The neural network processing will soon fit onto a microcontroller chip, which will minimize support electronics and transfer the burden of signal generation from the microsensor itself to the support electronics.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
The cermet sensor research team is also developing other microsensors.  Researchers are working to apply new measurement techniques to tin oxide sensors and thin-film/thick-film hybrids, using advanced materials.  The team is also rebuilding the microsensors to exploit a new thin-film process called "metal organic chemical vapor deposition", which could reduce the microsensor's size and improve its sensitivity.

<H2>Dynamic Landscape Modeling Links Land Stewardship to the Military Mission</H2>
</TD>

<P>
<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
	New challenges face resource planners in the Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) as they seek to fulfill their land stewardship requirements with limited funding.  On-site and off-site environmental impacts, wildlife conservation issues, cultural resources concerns, and the need for training realism all dictate that natural resources be maintained and enhanced on these installations.  The tasks of balancing multiple military and nonmilitary land uses, complying with resource regulations, and assessing the impacts on the sustainability of both the resource base and the military mission are complex and challenging.  Management actions to alleviate one resource problem can often exacerbate others.  In order to make the most efficient use of available resources, it is necessary to make trade-offs so that the most valuable and effective efforts are funded first, and less valuable efforts are only pursued if funds are available.  At a time when conservation funding is growing increasingly scarce and the demands for adequate justification of decision making are growing stronger, a new dynamic approach is needed to help resource managers in their decision-making.
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
	To fulfill this need a new approach is underway with funding from the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) and work conducted by the Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and the U.S. Army's Construction Engineering Research Laboratories (USACERL).  Called the Integrated Dynamic Landscape Analysis and Modeling System (IDLAMS), it is an integration of ecological models, decision support techniques, and a geographic information system (GIS) that incorporates remote sensing and field inventory data.  Based on DoD user requirements, the project objective is to create a methodology and develop a decision-support system that will link the site military mission with the planning needs for biological conservation and resource management on DoD installations.
<P>
	The development of IDLAMS will assist the decision-makers in identifying and resolving land-use issues and help determine cost-effective solutions to long-term land stewardship problems.  The approach offers a computer technology that enables resource managers to integrate their planning process by identifying multiple land use objectives and incorporating trade-off analysis, determining the cost and economics of viable land management alternatives, and incorporating "what if" scenarios into their decision-making.  The user-friendly interface allows the resource manager to operate this predictive, decision-making and planning tool without the need for substantial GIS training or extensive environmental modeling expertise.
<P>
The central component of IDLAMS is a vegetation (land cover) change model, which incorporates naturally occurring changes, changes due to training use, and those resulting from resource management activities.  Other management concerns such as soil erosion, water quality, wildlife, and cultural resources can also be modeled and linked to the vegetation dynamics submodel.  Also, SERDP has funded other research efforts that can provide additional submodels to the IDLAMS framework and has facilitated the coordination among complimentary projects.  For example, the system currently being tested at Fort Riley, Kansas, can model and predict changes in vegetation type that might result from fire, forest/shrub expansion, or secondary succession of grassland following training activity disturbances.  It also has submodels for soil erosion prediction and wildlife habitat suitability analyses.  In addition to the GIS spatial analysis component, ANL is investigating the use of advanced, remote-sensing technologies to provide large-scale, high-resolution images for use in the overall dynamic landscape model. 
<P>
	Although principally an ecological modeling environment, IDLAMS also uses a value-based decision-analysis process to link the ecological models with the management needs and user requirements of the resource manager.  To help accomplish this task, ANL held a two-day workshop bringing together land managers from several representative installations (Fort Riley, Kansas and Fort McCoy, Wisconsin) and natural resource experts from ANL and USACERL.  The workshop was facilitated by Dr. Ralph Keeney, an internationally-known expert in the field of decision-analysis.  Participants met to develop operational definitions for land management objectives, determine and prioritize a list of relevant objectives to be used, and define measures to estimate the extent to which those objectives are reached and can be incorporated into a decision-support system.  The information gathered at this initial workshop, and through a follow-up workshop, is currently being quantified and will be used to develop and test the decision-support system.  This system will result in a more systematic evaluation of resource management actions undertaken at military installations.  This approach will be further enhanced to incorporate the cost and economics of viable land management alternatives.
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
	The initial Dynamic Landscape Modeling System (DLMS) developed for Fort Riley, Kansas is currently being field tested at the installation.  The expanded, more robust modeling/GIS approach (IDLAMS) is now under development at an additional DoD site (Fort McCoy, Wisconsin).  This will involve the development of an oak savanna vegetation dynamics submodel (which will include a fire modeling component), as well as continued development and refinement of submodels which may include erosion/water quality, wildlife, cultural resources, and past land uses.  The choice of submodels will be evaluated and determined through coordination with the Fort McCoy natural and cultural resource staff as well as other installation personnel.  The development of new submodels for IDLAMS will be complimentary to various ongoing DoD efforts.
<P>
	The project's scientific approach and the resulting IDLAMS system will enable resource managers to quantify the effects of land management actions, both spatially and over time.  The project offers a planning framework and a technology that will be transferred to installation site managers by providing pertinent resource information and a set of computer tools linked to their existing geographic information system (GIS).
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Although the initial emphasis of the project has focused on military installations, the technology currently under development can also be used at DOE sites.  Future enhancements of this dual-use technology could have widespread application to help other federal and state agency resource managers and planners meet the challenges of fulfilling land stewardship requirements, balancing multiple management objectives, and supporting their primary mission with increasingly limited conservation funding.

<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
Traditionally, recycling of appliances has been driven by the value of their scrap steel.  In the last 15 years, however, the use of plastics in appliance manufacturing has increased substantially, at the expense of metals.  To increase the recycling of obsolete appliances in the future, cost-effective and environmentally acceptable technologies need to be developed to recover, upgrade, and reuse plastics from discarded appliances.  It is estimated that more than 300 million pounds of high-value plastics could be recovered and reused, resulting in a reduction of up to 90% in appliance-related solid waste that would otherwise end up in landfills.
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Through collaborative research with industry, Argonne National Laboratory is developing a process for recovering valuable individual plastics from the non-metallic fractions generated by appliance shredding operations.  Further, to enhance the market penetration of recycled plastic materials, cost-effective methods for improving the performance of the recovered plastics will be developed.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="../gifs/recov.plastics.gif"><BR>
<P>
<B>An estimated 300 million pounds of plastics from obsolete appliances could be recovered and reused.</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
The recovery process consists of granulating the non-metallic material, which is generated by appliance shredding and disassembly operations, to 1/4-inch size.  The granulated material is then processed via mechanical/physical separation methods into several fractions:  polyurethane foam and other light materials; thermoplastics, which include high-density polystyrene (HIPS) and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS); and a small fraction consisting of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) nylon and some metals.  The thermoplastics fraction is further separated via acid/solvent-assisted methods into two high-value plastics:  ABS and HIPS.  The ABS materials recovered from appliances could have a market value in the range of 40-70/lb.
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
A laboratory-scale process for recovering ABS and HIPS plastics has been demonstrated, and more than 100 pounds of high-purity ABS has been produced and analyzed to determine its properties and upgrading needs.  Tests conducted on the properties of the recovered ABS indicate that this material has good performance characteristics and could be recycled to high-value applications.

A demonstration plant is scheduled to be built in 1996 to evaluate the overall economic and technical performance of this process.  A major appliance recycler has tentatively agreed to use one of its facilities for the demonstration of this process.  With industry collaboration, the market value of the recovered plastics will be optimized by researching cost-effective strategies for upgrading the properties of the materials.

<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
Soils contaminated by chemical warfare agents pose a unique remediation problem for military installations.  At Rocky Mountain Arsenal, near Denver, chemical and incendiary munitions have been produced and dismantled since the 1940s.  The chemical warfare agents most likely to be encountered at the Arsenal are the blister agents, mustard and lewisite, and the nerve agents, GB and VX.  Success in identifying effective remediation technologies will pave the way for full-scale treatment of the Arsenal's agent-contaminated soil.  Technologies that Argonne National Laboratory identifies as promising may also have applicability to other kinds of contamination problems.  
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Argonne, a pioneer in studying the problem of agent-contaminated soils, is evaluating different treatment technologies for treating such soils at Rocky Mountain Arsenal.  
<P>

<P>
<CENTER><B>Argonne is helping Rocky Mountain Arsenal choose the most appropiate<BR> remediation path for treating soils contaminated by chemical warfare agents.</B></CENTER>
<P>
The laboratory work, which will be performed on simulants to the agent, has two phases.  The first is a small-scale screening of the technologies, using small samples (1 to 20 grams).  Experiments are conducted over a wide range of values to establish operational parameters.  Findings will help identify a narrower set of values to be tested during the second phase.  The second phase features bench-scale feasibility tests using larger (1-kilogram) soil samples, which will provide better insight into the mechanisms of handling large soil volumes.
<P>
Argonne is pursuing two cleanup technologies: thermal desorption and solvent washing.  Thermal desorption involves the removal of contaminants that have adhered to the soil matrix (adsorption) or are held in voids between particles (absorption).  Solvent washing extracts compounds by dissolving them in a fluid.  Because the agents in question are highly toxic, more benign compounds with similar chemical properties are used to "spike" test soils in the laboratory.
<P>
In thermal desorption, treated soil and off-gases will be analyzed for the simulated agent and expected degradation products.  Later, in Phase Two, 1-kilogram soil samples will be treated in an indirectly heated, batch, rotary-kiln desorption unit.
<P>
Triethylamine is currently being studied for solvent washing.  Laboratory screening will test for triethylamine's solubility with target compounds, maximum extractability, and removal efficiency.
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
Preliminary to laboratory experiments, Argonne conducted an extensive literature review on agent chemistry, toxicology, decontamination, potential treatment technologies, and applicable laws and regulations.  A database of 300 entries was compiled.  Using the findings from the literature search, Argonne conducted an evaluation of 26 in-situ and ex-situ technologies.  Each technology was screened for cost-effectiveness, implementation potential, and decontamination effectiveness.  From these paper studies, Argonne then chose its two candidate technologies to test for feasibility at the laboratory scale:  thermal desorption and solvent washing.
<P>
Soil spiking, analytical development, and preliminary screening are progressing.  There are no data to report as yet.
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Both solvent washing and thermal desorption have been tested on pesticide-contaminated soils at Rocky Mountain Arsenal.  One of the goals is to use either process to treat pesticide- and agent-contaminated soil simultaneously.
<P>
If the experimental program has positive results, commercial vendors will be screened by Argonne and invited to demonstrate their processes with full-scale prototypes.  A final evaluation will be prepared for each vendor process, including projected costs.  Argonne expects to continue as an unbiased, expert consultant that can screen potential treatments for specific contaminated sites and assist in the testing, evaluation, and selection of appropriate vendors to provide full-scale remediation.

<H2>Using Monatomic Nitrogen to Reduce NOx in Engine Exhaust</H2>

<P>
<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
More than one-third of the nation's population lives where air quality violates federal public health standards for air pollution caused by the key pollutants emitted by vehicles:  hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide.  Beginning in 1998, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 mandate that light- and heavy-duty vehicles powered by diesel engines must meet new emissions standards.  <P>
Researchers have known for nearly two decades that oxygen-enriched combustion air enhances engine performance and reduces exhaust emissions.  Oxygen enrichment improves combustion by increasing the ratio of oxidant to fuel in the cylinders of engines.  This results in a faster burn rate and higher flame temperatures and reduces the products of incomplete combustion (HC and CO).  Using oxygen enrichment reduces HC and CO in both gasoline- and diesel-engine exhaust, but NOx emissions are increased.  As a result, oxygen enrichment is currently appropriate only during the cold-start phase of vehicle operation, when NOx emissions are relatively low and not affected by oxygen enrichment.

<B>After-treatment of NOx in the exhaust with a monatomic nitrogen plasma.</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Argonne National Laboratory has developed a new method for after-treatment of NOx in the exhaust whereby monatomic nitrogen plasma is used.  The new method should make oxygen enrichment applicable during the entire driving cycle.  Monatomic nitrogen, however, is unstable and cannot be stored.  As part of its work on applying oxygen-enriched air to internal combustion engines, Argonne investigated the use of membrane separation.  Research results suggest that the membrane "waste stream," which contains nitrogen-enriched air, could be used as feedstock for producing monatomic nitrogen.
<P>
Pulsed-spark and steady-spark methods of electrically activating the nitrogen are being investigated.  The goal is to develop a cost-effective electrical activation device for engine and vehicle applications.
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
By using Argonne's NOx after-treatment technology, 50-90% reductions of NOx, even in the presence of oxygen, have been demonstrated.  These results indicate that this technique could be used to control NOx in gasoline engines.  
<P> 
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Tests with nitrogen dioxide and oxygen mixtures, as well as with synthetic gasoline-engine exhaust, will be conducted. Actual engine testing will follow.

<H2>Making Chemical Feedstocks from Renewable and Agricultural Resources</H2>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
Large-volume industrial chemicals and materials are generally synthesized from fossil fuels.  Other potential commercial feedstocks include resources from renewable and agricultural processes.  However, these resources are not widely used because of the lack of cost-effective technologies for manufacturing high-volume chemical building blocks from these materials.  America's agricultural industry could be revitalized by expanding market demand for farm and forestry products, while the chemical industry would benefit from less costly feedstocks.
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Argonne National Laboratory is participating in a consortium of five national laboratories.  The goal is to use resources from renewable and agricultural processes as feedstocks to demonstrate new pathways to production of chemicals (such as succinic acid, the first target of Argonne's program).  Argonne is applying metabolic engineering to develop superior organisms that improve product yield, productivity, and tolerance.  Electrodialysis techniques are being applied to product recovery, and a novel process is being developed to produce low-cost, high-purity intermediates suitable for further conversion.  Argonne is also developing new, degradable polyester derivatives, which could increase the succinic acid market significantly.
<P>
Currently, succinic acid is produced by using a hydrocarbon-based process that oxidizes n-butane to maleic anhydride.  The maleic anhydride is then hydrated to the acid form and hydrogenated to yield succinic acid.  A fermentation process using glucose derived from corn syrup can also produce succinic acid, but it is not economically competitive.  Argonne is improving fermentation efficiency by using conventional and genetic techniques to develop superior succinic-acid-producing organisms.
<P>
Conventional technology for primary purification involves addition of sulfuric acid to the fermentation broth, which contains calcium succinate.  This step generates large volumes of calcium sulfate salt waste, which poses a serious waste management problem for industrial-scale processes.  Other, newer technologies also generate different kinds of waste salts.  In contrast, Argonne's primary purification process uses advanced desalting and water-splitting electrodialysis technologies.  These technologies purify the succinic acid efficiently and economically without generating the large volumes of salt waste streams.
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
The feasibility of electrodialysis for primary purification of succinic acid has been demonstrated by using fermentation broths.  Economic analysis shows that this process should reduce the overall succinic-acid production cost by about 6/lb, compared with conventional methods.  The feasibility of a novel secondary purification process is being studied.  Genetic analysis of the succinic-acid pathways has generated metabolic engineering approaches for biocatalyst development.
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
For succinic acid production, Argonne will continue development efforts and participate in a demonstration of an integrated process for converting carbohydrates to succinic acid to 1,4-butanediol.  The demonstration is planned to start in late 1995, and the integrated process will be operated continuously for a period long enough to test critical parameters in the fermentation, recovery, and catalytic conversion processes.  Additional products (such as butanol) will be studied during 1995.  Argonne will contribute its technical expertise in biocatalyst development and product recovery.

<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
The U.S. food-processing industry generates large volumes of carbohydrate wastes, which are ideal substrates for bioconversion to useful, high-value products, such as lactic acid and its derivatives, which include biodegradable plastics, oxychemicals, "green" solvents, and specialty chemicals.  However, lactic acid production generates large volumes of salt wastes, which pose a serious disposal and management problem for industrial-scale processes.
<P>
Opportunities exist to develop more efficient, environmentally sound technologies for large-scale production of lactic acid and to develop novel applications for lactic acid derivatives.  If lactic acid could be produced from carbohydrates at lower costs and in larger quantities, the potential market for the acid and its derivatives could reach about $3.2-$4.4 billion/yr.
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Argonne National Laboratory has conducted comprehensive market and economic analyses of lactic acid and its derivatives and the technologies for their production.  On the basis of these analyses, Argonne's strategy is to develop (1) processes for the conversion of carbohydrate wastes into lactic acid esters and their derivatives and (2) novel product applications to expand the lactic acid market.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/food.gif"><BR>
<P>
<B>Argonne's process and product development strategy for lactic acid and its derivatives.</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
The key technologies being developed by Argonne for lactic acid production are fermentation, primary purification, secondary purification, and the various polymerization or chemical conversion technologies for making lactic acid derivatives.  Traditionally, lactic acid is purified by adding sulfuric acid to the fermentation broth, which contains calcium lactate.  This step generates a large volume of calcium sulfate salt waste.  Other, new technologies also generate different kinds of waste salts.  In contrast, Argonne's primary purification process uses advanced desalting and water-splitting electrodialysis technologies.  These technologies purify the lactic acid efficiently and economically without generating a salt waste stream.
<P>
To produce lactic acid derivatives, Argonne uses a different lactate intermediate (lactate ester instead of lactic acid), which facilitates high-volume manufacture of several different chemicals.  Argonne's process for making high-molecular-weight polylactic acid uses a chemical pathway that differs from the commonly used lactide route.  This results in greater versatility, allowing synthesis of polymers with tailored properties.
<P>
Previous research has resulted in an efficient fermentation process, an electrodialysis-based primary purification that eliminates salt waste and novel products of lactic acid oligomers and polymers.  Current efforts are focused on the development of a novel secondary purification process, the development of lactate-derived products that can significantly expand the lactic acid market, and technology transfer activities to commercialize the processes and products.

</LI>

<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Argonne will continue efforts in process and product development for lactic acid and its derivatives, including the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Technical support to a major industrial company for piloting and commercializing lactic acid production technologies,</LI>
<LI>Further development of a novel esterification process for the secondary purification of lactic acid, and</LI>
<LI>Continued development and testing of lactate-derived products with industrial collaborators.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
In addition, a cooperative R&D agreement (a funds-in CRADA) with a technology company is expected to be established in 1995 to develop and commercialize applications of advanced electrodialysis-separation technologies, which prevent pollution by recycling waste salts into their corresponding acids and bases.

<H2>Recovering Hydrogen and Sulfur from Refinery Wastes</H2>

<P>
<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
Each year, the refining industry spends a quarter-billion dollars to produce hydrogen so that sulfur can be removed from refinery products.  This creates more than 6 million tons of hydrogen sulfide, a waste that must be treated to meet environmental regulations.  Although current waste-treatment technology recovers nearly all of the sulfur (99.0-99.5%), the remaining amount is emitted to the atmosphere as sulfur dioxide.  Moreover, the valuable hydrogen is burned to water, making it unavailable for further use.  This loss has a direct impact on bottom-line production costs for the refinery.
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Argonne National Laboratory-based researchers are developing a new process, called MISHA, that uses microwave plasma chemistry to split hydrogen sulfide.  This patented process recovers hydrogen and sulfur from hydrogen sulfide and recycles the hydrogen to the refinery.  MISHA (Microwave-Induced Sulfur and Hydrogen Autolysis) is an excellent fit for refineries because it would replace both the operating old Claus and tail-gas clean-up units while decreasing costly on-site hydrogen production.  In some refinery situations, MISHA can also replace the amine purification unit, thereby achieving even greater refinery savings.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/misha.gif"><BR>
<P>
<B>MISHA recovers and recycles hydrogen.</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
Two reactor conditions must be satisfied to explain the observed hydrogen sulfide conversions and the low energy consumption:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The microwave energy must be efficiently transferred to the plasma to create a high-temperature zone (thousands of degrees).</LI>
<LI>The fluid dynamics within the plasma-chemical reactor must isolate and stabilize the plasma and, simultaneously, rapidly separate and cool the products.  This freezes the products at a composition which is characterized by the plasma temperature rather than the bulk-gas temperature.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
To satisfy these reactor conditions, the feed is injected tangentially into the reactor, above the central plasma zone.  This creates a turbulent cyclonic flow that prevents the plasma from contacting the reactor wall and minimizes energy losses.  It also creates a thin, turbulent, high-temperature layer on the surface of the plasma, where hydrogen sulfide rapidly dissociates.  The turbulence of this boundary layer ensures that the dissociation products are quenched as they remix with the bulk gas flowing around the plasma.  Furthermore, the sulfur reacts with itself to form high-molecular-weight clusters that are driven to the wall of the reactor by the centrifugal forces generated by the cyclonic flow.  This prevents sulfur from re-entering the turbulent boundary layer and back-reacting.
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
Argonne's experiments have confirmed the critical contribution of the cyclonic flow to increasing the hydrogen sulfide conversion and lowering its energy of dissociation.  However, the experiments challenge two of the predictions derived from a theoretical plasma-chemical model:  (1) Argonne obtained a plasma at atmospheric pressure with less than 1 kW of power, whereas the model predicted that 30kW or more was required; and (2) the Argonne experiments do not show the predicted sharp rise in dissociation energies at pressures greater than 0.65 atm.  Furthermore, Argonne's analysis of the gas dynamics in the plasma-chemical reactor indicates that additional improvements in hydrogen sulfide conversion and process efficiency are possible.
<P>
Argonne's experiments have shown that:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>MISHA recovers both the hydrogen and the sulfur at lower costs while saving energy and oil,</LI>
<LI>MISHA's hydrogen sulfide emissions would be minuscule, less than 10 tons/yr,  for a facility recovering 158 long tons/day of sulfur and 3.9 million scf/day of hydrogen, and</LI>
<LI>In some locations, MISHA could easily be used to recover marketable hydrogen from natural gas production operations.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Argonne is searching for an industrial partner to scale up the laboratory plasma-chemical reactor to an industrial-scale prototype reactor operating with 10-20 kW of microwave power.  This plasma reactor would provide the necessary engineering data to design a commercial process for treating hydrogen sulfide and the economic data needed to determine the commercial potential of the process.

<B>Problem/ Opportunity</B>
<P>
Auto shredders generate 3-5 million tons of waste, commonly known as automotive shredder residue (ASR), annually.  The recycling of automotive plastics, which constitute about 20-30% of ASR by weight, is not currently practiced on a commercial basis.  The components are not recycled for several reasons, including a lack of a cost-effective technology for recovering plastics, potential contamination of the plastics with other materials from the ASR stream, and the absence of a strong market.
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Argonne National Laboratory is testing a technically promising, potentially economical process to recycle polymers and other constituents from ASR.  The value of the recovered plastics could be very competitive in a variety of applications; one of the first might be polyurethane foam for carpet padding.

<B>Argonne is testing a potentially economical process to recycle polymers and other constitutents from automotive shredder residue.</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
The Argonne technique for recycling ASR begins with mechanical/physical separation of the ASR into several fractions: polyurethane foam, which is separated and cleaned; iron-oxide-rich "fines," which may be used by the cement industry as a source of iron oxide; and a plastics-rich stream, from which Argonne dissolves and recovers heat-formed plastics (thermoplastics).  The solvent used in the process is regenerated and continuously recycled.  If fines, foam, and plastics are recycled, as much as 75% of landfill waste could be eliminated.
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
A demonstration plant at a shredder site is now processing polyurethane foam.  At the same time, four different plastics are being recovered in a batch-process unit, in quantities of 1 to 5 pounds each.  The plastics being recovered for evaluation are acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, and polypropylene.  Plans are also under way to run a large-scale test using fines in cement.
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Some 20,000 pounds of polyurethane foam are being accumulated for an Argonne techno-economic evaluation in early 1995.  Argonne engineers are designing a continuous-process demonstration plant that could produce 3,000 tons of foam per year.  Commercialization of the polyurethane foam process could come as early as the beginning of 1996.

<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
Since the 1960s, millions of pounds of solid rocket propellant have been produced annually to support U.S. missile and rocket programs.  Today, the 
U. S. Department of Defense (DoD) has a requirement to develop safe and economic technologies to demilitarize and to dispose of large rocket motors loaded with either of two propellants (Type 1.1 or Type 1.3).  This requirement has occurred as a result of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties (START I and II) and normal obsolescence, as well as increasingly stringent environmental regulations that have made the open burning of propellant unacceptable.  Such unconfined burning of these energetic materials typically releases large clouds of smoke and toxic gases, including hydrochloric acid.  The volume to be disposed of may be over 30 million pounds per year.
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
In a joint program between Argonne National Laboratory and the U.S. Army Defense Ammunition Center and School (USADACS), a systems analysis is being conducted on six different propellant removal technologies, as well as two different technologies for the treatment of effluent waste streams.  Two versatile computerized products are being used to simulate the operation of these propellant removal systems:  Aspen PlusR and the Environmental Simulation Program (ESP), both of which generate material and energy balances.  Aspen Plus is also being used to identify the most promising integrated systems by estimating capital and operating costs.
<P>

<IMG SRC="../gifs/rocket.motor.gif"><BR>
<P>
<B>Technique for recovering solid propellant from a rocket motor casting.</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
By using the most sophisticated, versatile computer software for process simulation, Argonne's approach provides an independent, unified, consistent perspective for the analysis.  Implementation of the analysis will result in safe, environmentally sound operating practices.
<P>
The separate steps are being assembled into a viable, complete, and integrated system that incorporates opportunities for recovery and reuse of valuable propellant components.  The technique for recovering solid propellant from a rocket motor casing (see figure) begins with the application of work on the propellant, either with mechanical cutting or with hydraulic cutting via a very high-pressure jet of working fluid.  Propellant particles are separated for further treatment and recovery, while any accompanying dust and/or liquid wastes are sent to treatment facilities.  Where possible, working fluid is recovered and recycled.  After drying, if necessary, the propellant may be used in applications less demanding than rocket motors.  For example, recovered propellant has successfully been used as a component of explosives for mining and quarrying.  This particular reuse application appears to have very promising economic advantages for an integrated system.
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
USADACS contractors have begun to operate pilot-scale facilities and to supply operating data and conditions to Argonne for use in computer process simulations, including process flow diagrams.  The systems analysis and integration using the Argonne computer have been completed (except for economics) for all of the processes under consideration.  The converged material and energy balances have been computed and used to generate a tabulation of all of the process stream flows, including waste effluents from those processes that have waste streams.  Some technologies have little or no waste effluent to treat.
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Argonne's joint work with USADACS will include the use of Aspen Plus to estimate the capital required to construct a selected full-scale recovery technology and to estimate the cost per pound to operate such a facility.  The goal is to do this for both propellant types (1.1 and 1.3).  Such a comprehensive computerized description of a given technology is expected to be a valuable, user-friendly tool for thorough study of the process parameters that could lead to an optimum design.

<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
Half of the steel produced in the United States is derived from scrap.  With zinc-coated prompt scrap increasing fivefold since 1980, steelmakers are feeling the effect of increased contaminant loads on their operations.  The greatest concerns are the cost of treatment before disposal of waste dusts and the water associated with remelting zinc-coated scrap.  An economical process is needed to strip and recover the zinc from scrap to prepare it for steelmaking.
<P>
The operating-cost benefits to the steelmaking industry from such a process are estimated to be $140 million per year (compared with using non-scrap sources of iron).  Environmental compliance costs would be mitigated by about $150 million per year.  Foreign exchange could also benefit by some $130 million per year, through reductions in zinc imports.
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Through a cost-sharing program with Metal Recovery Industries U.S., Inc., Argonne National Laboratory is developing a new technology for converting galvanized steel scrap from stamping plant wastes into clean scrap for steelmaking.  With further development, the technology could also process galvanized steel scrap from obsolete automobiles.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/junk.cars.gif"><BR>
<P>
<B>The degalvanizing process will be tested on shredded auto scrap.  This is the largest source of ferrous scrap.</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
The process consists of dissolving the zinc coating from scrap in a hot, caustic solution and recovering the zinc from the solution electrolytically.  The zinc-bearing scrap is charged in an electrolytic cell containing a 7090 degrees C sodium hydroxide solution.  Applying an electric potential dissolves the zinc into the hot caustic.  Clean scrap is removed, rinsed, and recycled.  The electrolyte is then pumped into a second cell, where the zinc is electrolytically removed from the solution.  The zinc can be sold to refiners for purification and resale.
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
Metal Recovery Industries U.S., Inc., has installed a 50,000-ton/year pilot plant in East Chicago, Indiana.  This plant has dezinced over 1,000 tons of automotive stamping waste, and tests have demonstrated that the process can remove not only zinc, but also many plastic coatings.  Tests continue to evaluate process economics and operation.
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Plans are to provide 1,500 tons of dezinced scrap for a melt test to determine the environmental impact of dezinced scrap on furnace operations.  If testing is successful, detailed engineering will begin on a 200,000-ton/year dezincing demonstration plant for late 1996.  Plants like this one could be used for future commercial operations.

Technologies for capturing, using, and disposing of carbon dioxide (CO2) need to be considered as part of an overall strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to global warming.  Systems that integrate coal gasification with combined-cycle power generation, combined with CO2-capture technologies, are an important option for future coal-based electricity supplies.  Integrated gasification/combined cycle (IGCC) systems feature high energy conversion efficiency.  Also, as shown by field studies, IGCC systems produce very low levels of sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides, which cause acid rain and other pollution problems.

Argonne National Laboratory's work emphasizes IGCC systems combined with CO2-capture technologies.  The entire fuel-cycle was considered, from mining the coal through CO2 pipeline transport and sequestering.  Commercial CO2-capture technology provided performance and economic baselines for comparing innovative technologies.
<P>

<B>Energy system components for CO2 recovery.</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
By taking an overview of the fuel cycle, it was possible to compare the overall impact of each stage of the cycle and assess its relative importance.  Process evaluation included contact with commercial vendors to refine the engineering assessments for available technologies.  These assessments identified potential problem areas and development needs, evaluated key process tradeoffs, and estimated costs for the technologies.
<P>
Commercial processes based on CO2 solubility in amines, glycol, and methanol were studied, as well as facilitated transport membranes (a still non-commercial technology).  Also considered were high-temperature technologies (for example, calcium- or magnesium-based sorbents and molten carbonate membranes).  CO2 recovery was set at 90%, and the combustion turbine was fed a high hydrogen-content fuel.  From the IGCC plant, a 500-km pipeline took the CO2 to geological sequestering.
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
Results showed that the base IGCC plant was cheaper and more efficient than conventional pulverized coal-fired boilers.  However, Argonne found significant reductions in the IGCC plant's net electric power production.  For a 458-MW base case, these reductions ranged from 73.6 MW to 185.1 MW with a 0.29-0.53 kg/kWhe CO2 release rate (after considering makeup power).  Life-cycle CO2 sequestering costs were $113-201/ton of CO2, resulting in electricity costs that are 74-113% higher than the base case.
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Argonne will continue actively monitoring development of U.S. environmental policy related to greenhouse gases.

<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
Competition is intensifying in the power generation and transmission business because of gradual deregulation.  With tougher competition, the heat rate of the power plant becomes a more important issue.  One long-established method to reduce the heat rate is to lower the back-pressure of the surface condenser.  This is accomplished by retubing existing units with commercially available enhanced tubes.  While this practice has been successfully used by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) for the past 15 years, Argonne National Laboratory is now working with TVA and other utilities to (1) determine the potential heat-rate reductions that are possible by retubing with enhanced tubes; (2) make utilities aware of these benefits; and (3) eliminate such technical concerns as tube-side fouling, tube vibrations, and eddy currents.
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
To determine the heat-rate reduction, Argonne has written a computer program that performs the lengthy thermal calculations on the basis of information supplied by the utility.  Publications in journals and presentations at conferences and meetings are being used by Argonne to acquaint utilities with the experience obtained with enhanced tubes and to address the most common concerns.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/condenser.gif"><BR>
<P>
<B>The spirally indented enhanced tube is the type most commonly used for power-plant condenser retubings.</B>
<P>
</CENTER>
The quantity of heat rejected by the tubes in surface condensers is a function of the surface area and the surface profile of the tubes.  Enhanced tubes improve the thermal performance inside the tube because they (1) increase the surface area per foot of tubing and (2) modify the flow field by increasing turbulence levels and decreasing the boundary-layer thickness.  Performance improvements outside the tube depend on the particular type of enhancement - that is, the disruption or roughness shapes and manufacturing process used.  These improvements are offset somewhat by an increase in tube-side pressure drop and higher fouling rates for some cooling-water types.
<P>
A computer program was developed to calculate the heat-rate reduction that can be obtained by retubing with Korodense LPD, a commercially available tube made by Wolverine Tube, Inc.  The program incorporates the thermal performance characteristics obtained by monitoring 14 operating TVA condensers that were retubed with Korodense LPD.
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
Argonne has conducted research to identify enhanced tubes that are superior in performance to Korodense LPD.  The research yielded two important findings:  (1) more outside enhancement is needed through the use of low-fins and (2) the internal disruption shapes should be more contoured.  Enhanced condenser tubes of the low-fin type are now being used successfully in Japan, but not in the United States.  The profile modifications of the spirally indented enhanced tubes can be made with a larger diameter indenting tool and are being considered as a possible option by Wolverine Tube.
<P>
The following major barriers to the use of enhanced condenser tubes have been eliminated:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Uncertainty of performance,
<LI>Concern of excessive fouling,
<LI>Lack of long-term successful demonstrations, and</LI>
<LI>Low cost-effectiveness. 
</UL>
<P>
Results of investigations to date indicate that increases of 30-40% in the overall heat-transfer coefficient (with a cleanliness factor equal to 
1.3 to 1.4) are obtained in the clean condition with Korodense LPD.  Argonne is continuing to monitor the performance of these units and that of others to update these characteristics.  For most river waters, the superior performance is maintained for a year or more.  The new clean condition can be obtained by mechanical or chemical cleaning during shutdown or by on-line ball cleaning.  Intermittent chlorination also effectively controls biofouling.  The 14 retubed TVA condensers are operating successfully, one of them for 15 years.  Recent studies with Argonne's computer program indicate that payback times of 1 to 3 years are possible for many utility condensers when retubing is necessary.
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Progress is being made to identify superior tube configurations for power-plant condensers.  Several have been identified, and approximate prediction methods were developed.  If funding is obtained, the next step will be to demonstrate these performance improvements by conducting experiments in the condenser of a host utility.

<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
In fluidized-bed reactors, boilers, and transport lines, metal loss occurs in varying degrees on the walls of vessels and internal components such as heat exchangers.  Metal loss is plaguing the effective operation of these units by causing shutdowns for unscheduled maintenance/refurbishing, which cost millions of dollars in lost revenues each year.  Erosion rates of 3 mm/1000 hours for reactor walls are not uncommon in conventional fluidized-bed boilers.  Similar rates have also been reported in petroleum fluid cracking units and silicone product reactors.  New software can be used to mitigate metal erosion in fluidized-bed reactors, which reduces costs and improves reactor design and operation.
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Argonne National Laboratory participated in a cost-sharing consortium with fluidized-bed boiler manufacturers and with governmental/private research agencies such as the DOE's Morgantown Energy Technology Center, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), and the Tennessee Valley Authority.
<P>

<B>Predicted erosion rates vs. the fluidizing velocity for several Geldart's class B particle sizes.</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
Using its advanced computational fluid dynamic capabilities, Argonne provided a mechanical understanding of metal erosion in fluidized-bed systems by computing solids motion and assessing its impact on erosion of reactor vessels and internals.  From these virtual reactor simulations, new effective sets of design guidelines were formulated to help industry mitigate and, in some instances, eliminate solids particle erosion in fluidized-bed systems.  
<P>
The erosion mitigation software is based on fluid-solids hydrodynamic models which can predict, for a given reactor, three-dimensional distributions of solids loading, gas and solids velocities, pressures, and temperatures.  These programs are based on the solution of Navier-Stokes multiphase equations using the IMF (implicit multi-field) numerical technique.  The computer program can simulate dense ebulliated reactors as well as very dilute, short-contact-time reactors such as those used in the petroleum cracking industry.
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
The erosion-reduction methodology developed at Argonne has been validated with proprietary data from a large-scale plant, which makes this methodology unique, proven, and directly usable by industry.  Through these solutions, companies can now save up to $2 million/yr on a large production-scale fluidized-bed process, by either refurbishing, modifying, and improving present processes and/or mitigating erosion problems.  With Argonne's advanced methodology, companies can also do a better job of designing and operating new fluidized-bed units with reduced erosion.
<P>
Foreign customers from emerging economies are seeking new reactor designs, and technology transfer plans are being formulated with private sector software companies.
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
A world leader in silicone manufacturing is considering developing Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) software capabilities for fluidized-bed systems which are directly tailored to its needs.

<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
More than 20 years ago, the Clean Air Act accelerated the development of pollution-control technologies for coal-combustion systems.  Attention was focused on the abatement of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate-matter emissions.  Subsequent concerns over the possible effects of acid rain served to strengthen that focus.  In 1990, Amendments to the Act addressed acid rain controls and reinforced restrictions on other air pollutants, such as ozone, which is influenced by NOx emissions.  An additional concern now receiving greater attention is the safe and economical disposal of large volumes of solid wastes from air-pollution control systems.  As new issues arise and emissions limits are gradually reduced, there are continuing needs for engineering improvements and research into new concepts that could lead to improved processes.  New or improved technologies for controlling emissions of NOx and SOx will enable U.S. industry to continue to compete in a cost-effective, environmentally sound manner.

<P>
In response to the directives of the Clean Air Act and its Amendments, Argonne National Laboratory is developing new or improved pollution-control technologies for industries that burn fossil fuels.  This research continues Argonne's traditional support for the DOE's Flue Gas Cleanup Program.  Argonne's pollutant emissions research has ranged from experiments in the basic chemistry of pollution-control systems, through laboratory-scale process development and testing, to pilot-scale field tests of several technologies.  Whenever appropriate, the work has emphasized integrated or combined control systems as the best approach to technologies that would offer low cost and good operating characteristics.
<P>
Laboratory facilities are available to address a variety of flue-gas cleanup problems by using realistic flue-gas compositions, on-line multicomponent gas analysis, and computerized data logging.  Current experimental systems include a complete wet scrubber, a unique spray-dryer/fabric-filter combination, and a fixed-bed reactor designed for investigation of dry sorbents.  Additional laboratory facilities are available for supporting bench-scale research and waste characterization studies.

<P>
The pilot plant at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, was used for over 40 years as an R&D center for chemical warfare agents and systems.  In 1986, activities were terminated, and by 1993 all furnishings and process equipment were removed.  Previous proposals for decommissioning the pilot plant were based on the plant's past association with agent materials.  Past recommendations called for enclosing the structures in tents and for removing the buildings in the most conservative way possible.  
<P>
The Argonne National Laboratory team realized that the Army's own regulations, literally interpreted, would be the greatest constraint on the flexibility of decommissioning activities. Argonne's approach was to quantify the condition of the facility, as well as to explore an alternative way to deal with the legal requirements.  The rules encompassed both federal and state solid and hazardous waste regulations and DoD requirements regarding the treatment of any materials associated with chemical weapons. Chief among the federal laws were the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1986 and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/building.gif"><BR>
<P>
<B>The Argonne decommissioning plan developed for the Aberdeen Proving Ground pilot plant complex could save the Department of Defense tens of millions of dollars.</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
If the Argonne decommissioning plan is accepted, DoD could save tens of millions of dollars, based on the estimates of previous plans.  Because other Army agent-related facilities will ultimately require similar action, the Argonne approach could result in savings 100 times the amount spent on the pilot-plant study.
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Army regulations suggest that all items coming in contact with chemical warfare agents must be heated to 1,000 degrees F for 15 minutes before they are released from DoD control.  Since chemical warfare agents are destroyed at this temperature, this approach ensures that all pilot-plant debris would be nonhazardous.  Other treatments, including chemical baths and washdown treatments, will also destroy agents.  But, historically, the Army has requested that materials be treated with nothing else but heat.
<P>
On the state and federal levels, it is unclear which regulations are applicable.  Under different interpretations, the pilot plant could fall under either RCRA or CERCLA regulations.  Under the debris rule of RCRA, structures are classified as buildings until they are demolished.  Therefore, activities that might change the characteristics of potential contaminants in the structures can be performed under RCRA and not be considered as waste treatment.
<P>
All parties involved want to minimize the amount of testing needed prior to razing since the rubble would have to be tested for both toxic and hazardous materials, as well as for chemical agents.  To determine the presence of chemical agents, vapors have been screened to less than one part per trillion for volatile agents.  Dust on the surface and in the pores of building surfaces will be collected for screening.  Heavy metals will be tested on wall surfaces and on structural steel.
<P>
Under the Argonne recommendations, the structures will be treated first, then crushed under controlled conditions. Representative solid samples will be collected, as well as vapor samples from storage boxes.  From tests on these samples, individual units of crushed debris will be evaluated to determine the success of the system.
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
Argonne's testing program, as well as new interpretations of Army, state, and federal regulations and proposed changes in the regulations themselves, points toward new, less costly demolition procedures.  Much of the material removed from the pilot plant may be recyclable as building materials or scrap metal after limited chemical treatment without heat treatment.
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
If the buildings are demolished and recycled according to Argonne recommendations, the Army can use this methodology for other facilities that need similar treatment.

<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
High concentrations of lead and other heavy metals in soils can pose a threat to human health.  Currently, soil samples are collected and analyzed in the laboratory for heavy metals by atomic absorption spectroscopy and/or inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy.  This requires sizable expenditures of time and funds.  Hand-held X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrum analyzers have been developed for detecting lead and other heavy metals in paint.  Further development of these units offers a potentially fast and inexpensive method of determining levels of lead and other heavy-metal contamination in soils.
<P>
Being able to take a hundred readings a day and having the data available immediately are the major benefits of portable XRF units.  Ordinarily, one would have to wait weeks for a laboratory to report analytical results.  With a small portable unit, a researcher can quickly determine the scope of lead contamination and then use laboratory results to verify field measurements.
<P>

<P>
<B>Argonne scientists are evaluating a hand-held X-ray fluorescence spectrum analyzer as a quick, convient, and inexpensive way of measuring concentrations of lead and other heavy metals in soils.</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
XRF units also reduce costs.  A laboratory analysis for lead and other heavy metals may cost $200-300 for each soil sample.  With portable XRF units, a large number of readings can be made at greatly reduced cost.
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
At Grafenwhr Training Area, a U.S. Army installation in southern Germany, Argonne National Laboratory researchers investigated small arms firing ranges for lead contamination in soils.  
<P>
A hand-held XRF unit was used to measure lead concentrations in soils in potentially contaminated areas.  Ranges devoted to rifle, pistol, and hand grenade practice were included in the study.  Readings taken on the rifle range indicated the highest level of lead in the surface soil.  At only a few centimeters beneath the surface, however, lead could no longer be detected.  At the pistol range, readings showed lower concentrations of lead than at the rifle range.  This is consistent with the fact that rifle slugs disintegrate on impact into small particles that are more easily incorporated into the soil.  Pistol slugs, on the other hand, remain intact on impact.
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
XRF field readings of lead contamination were confirmed by laboratory analysis.  With few exceptions, relative standard deviation was in the 8-10% range, which is very acceptable precision for a field-screening method.  The exceptions may reflect the heterogeneity of fine lead particles in soils and the fact that XRF has a bias toward low values for soils with high lead concentrations.
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
This technology has advanced to the point where it can be used for other heavy metals besides lead.  Argonne researchers are looking for opportunities to expand their investigations to other heavy metals and to determine the influence of soil texture and moisture conditions on this field-screening method.

<B>Problem/Opportunity </B>
<P>
Colonies of bacteria often create leaks in steel pipes that carry natural gas and many other products.  In pipeline systems where water collects, bacterial colonies can form deposits on metal surfaces and produce organic acids that accelerate corrosion and cause localized pitting.  The bacteria act as environmental "catalysts," creating corrosion under conditions that cannot be reproduced in the laboratory.  Microbially influenced corrosion (MIC) in the natural gas industry has been estimated to cause 15-30% of corrosion-related pipeline failures.  Improved MIC detection systems would provide early warning of pipeline failures and help avert worker injuries.  
<P>
In the United States, industries spend $1.2 billion annually on biocidal chemicals to fight MIC.  These treatments are not only costly, but they can also have a harmful environmental effect.  As regulatory scrutiny of biocides intensifies, these chemicals represent potential environmental liabilities to industry.  
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Argonne National Laboratory is developing the next generation of mitigation approaches, which are intended to reduce dependence on toxic chemical treatment.  To field test candidate technologies, Argonne established a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with Southern California Gas Company (SoCal Gas).  The next generation of approaches being developed and tested includes inexpensive carbon steels that resist MIC, "alternative" biocides that are less toxic than those now in use, and improved on-line MIC detection methods.  
<P>

<P>
<B>Argonne is developing methods for reducing pipeline corrosion that lessen dependence on toxic chemical treatment.</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
Argonne and SoCal Gas have both set up experimental test loop systems to study the prevention and monitoring of MIC.  Both systems use produced water from natural gas storage or production fields.  The test loop systems are being used for: 
<UL>
<LI>Screening and development of inexpensive MIC-resistant carbon steels,
<LI>Development of less toxic chemical treatments, and
<LI>Calibration and testing of on-line MIC detection methods and proprietary treatment approaches.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
SoCal Gas tests promising candidate metallurgies, treatments, and detection methods in the test loop system at its Montebello (California) natural gas storage field.  In addition to providing technical support for these field tests, Argonne uses its own laboratory test loop system to develop the information needed to improve the application or design of these technologies.
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
Argonne and SoCal Gas are currently field testing alternative chemical treatments in gas storage and recovery wells, which traditionally have been most susceptible to MIC.  At SoCal Gas's Montebello storage field, these treatment efforts are saving an estimated $1 million/year.  In addition, two on-line devices have been selected as candidates for MIC-specific monitoring.
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Further reduction in chemical usage will require an even better understanding of corrosion mechanisms.  In its laboratory test loop, Argonne will correlate localized corrosion with a specific electrochemical signal.
<P>
In addition, chemical companies and a steel tubing manufacturer are joining the CRADA to examine methods of using less toxic chemicals to prevent MIC and to examine the effects of metallurgy on susceptibility to MIC.

About 680 acres at Fort Benning Military Reservation, Georgia, were prepared as a parachute drop-zone in 1988.  Trees were cut down, stumps grubbed, and gullies filled, destroying existing plant cover.  This resulted in a barren, infertile landscape that became severely eroded.  Sediment was carried into adjacent forest, and the accumulation of sediment damaged and killed some of the den trees of the red-cockaded woodpecker, an endangered species that requires living trees for nesting.

<B>On the basis of Argonne's recommendations, modified agriculturial techniques were used to control erosion and revegetate a severely eroded area at Fort Benning, Georgia.</B>
<P>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/planted.forest.gif">
</CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Argonne's CERS was asked to develop an erosion control and revegetation plan for stabilizing the drop-zone.  CERS staff conducted site surveys to collect data on the amount and types of existing plant cover and the type and degree of soil erosion.  Soils samples were collected and analyzed to determine soil characteristics.   A global positioning system was used to map the locations of roads, existing dam checks, and other physical features.  This information was combined with topographic and other data, using a geographical information system, to provide detailed site maps.  Information was gathered on local climatic conditions, candidate revegetation species, and designs for erosion control structures.
<P>
Test plots were established to evaluate potential revegetation species and determine plant response to soil amendments.  These data were then used to develop detailed erosion control and revegetation plans and specifications.
<P>
Detailed cost data on materials, labor, and equipment used were collected during each rehabilitation operation.  Following revegetation efforts, changes in vegetation cover were monitored.  Field observations were made to determine the effectiveness of erosion control structures.  Cost information was combined with monitoring data and field observations to determine the cost-effectiveness of each rehabilitation operation.
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
Four erosion control and rehabilitation contracts have been implemented by local contractors at the drop-zone.  Revegetation efforts involved liming, fertilizing, and seeding with mixtures of adapted grasses and legumes to increase vegetative cover and reduce runoff rates.  Of the 680 acres in the drop-zone, approximately 365 have been limed, fertilized, and seeded; another 62 acres have been fertilized to increase vegetative cover and reduce soil erosion rates.  Over 1,000 feet of silt fence was constructed to curtail sediment deposition in adjacent forest areas.  The 1,400 feet of terrace and the 325 feet of riprap-lined waterway have helped to control erosion of the steep slope next to the airstrip.  Six porous check dams were constructed in gullies to limit gully erosion, and outlets on six existing check dams have been modified to reduce runoff velocity and trap sediment.
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Cost, effectiveness, and site condition data will be used to refine future erosion control and revegetation plans for other disturbed sites with similar conditions.

<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
The Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland has been the nation's primary chemical weapons laboratory since the early 1900s.  Toxic wastes located in pits, trenches, and other disposal sites at Aberdeen are suspected sources of aquifer contamination beneath the facility.  However, because of local discontinuities in silt and clay deposition during the late Pleistocene and Holocene periods, the hydrogeologic framework cannot be imaged with confidence by using a single geophysical technique to define pathways of this contamination.  Multiple technologies are required to guide sampling and remediation programs.  
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
With support from the environmental program at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, Argonne National Laboratory staff are using non-intrusive geophysical techniques to define aquifers and to guide drilling and sampling.  A pilot study was conducted in the southern Bush River Peninsula and adjacent waters to "see through" the Holocene-deposited silts and clays that effectively mask the underlying aquifers.   With the multiple technologies used by Argonne, identification of sediment type is possible at much lower costs than drilling.  Furthermore, data are acquired in a continuous profiling mode instead of discretely at specific testing stations.  Offshore and onshore data are well integrated.
<P> 
Aquifers beneath the Chesapeake estuary system are located in Cretaceous-age sediments of the Atlantic coastal plain and in paleochannels of Pleistocene age that were cut below sea level during low stands of the Pleistocene.  Subsequent rises in sea level during late Pleistocene and Holocene periods resulted in deposition of organic silts and clays that now blanket coastal plain sediments and effectively mask the underlying aquifers.
<P>
The Argonne approach to determining the hydrogeologic framework of these terranes was to use multiple geophysical data sets gathered both onshore and offshore.  From these data were inferred the geologic structure, distribution of silts and clays, existence of manmade artifacts, and porewater chemistry.
<P>	
Argonne utilized a variety of techniques to acquire the necessary data.  Side-scan sonar was used to image the details of water-bottom relief.  In shallow, high wave-energy areas near the shoreline, single-channel marine seismics provided high-resolution imaging.  Magnetometer profiling delineated the distribution of ferrous iron debris, as well as subtle trends in the magnetic properties of the bottom sediment.  Electrical conductivity mapping showed brackish water intrusion into shallow aquifers and differentiated coarse-grained materials associated with fluvial deposits from finer-grained silts and clays more commonly associated with quiet-water estuary environments.  Ground-penetrating radar imaging established the fine detail of water-bottom depths and the geologic framework to depths of 40 feet or more.
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
A combination of techniques has been used successfully by Argonne staff in the Edgewood section of the Aberdeen Proving Ground to provide an excellent understanding of the underlying geologic framework.  Data acquisition was completed during the summer of 1994.  Data processing and interpretation were finalized during the spring of 1995.  Three reports are about to be published.
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Technologies and procedures developed at the Aberdeen Proving Ground are constantly changing as they are modified and improved to explore the hydrogeologic framework at contaminated sites throughout the United States.

<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
In the remediation of soil and groundwater systems, a major concern is the time required for contaminants in the subsurface to be released and biodegraded.  Cleanup via in-situ bioremediation can take up to 100 years at sites where contaminants must be desorbed via diffusion.  Many "pump-and-treat" processes are thought to fail partly because desorption releases the contaminants very slowly.  Another cause of slow release could be the limited mobility of non-aqueous-phase liquids (NAPLs), which become pooled or trapped within soil matrices.  For these sites, innovative technologies are needed to achieve rapid, efficient cleanup at competitive costs.
<P>
Foam remediation technologies have the potential to increase the applicability of in-situ bioremediation.  Unlike other approaches, foams can be designed to remove pollutants and enhance bioremediation simultaneously.  Although foams have been applied successfully underground for enhanced oil recovery, they have not yet been systematically applied to environmental remediation problems closer to the surface.  Argonne National Laboratory is exploring the opportunity to adapt and mature this existing technology for environmental remediation purposes, such as for the cleanup of hazardous waste at federal facilities.
<P>

<P>
<B>Foam delivery concept</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Argonne is using foams to release and mobilize NAPL contaminants in the subsurface and is coupling this technology with bioremediation (either in-situ or ex-situ).  Unlike surfactants, foams remove contaminants by physical scouring, in addition to surface tension reduction and solubilization.  The physical scouring mechanism is particularly well suited for extraction of residual trapped NAPLs from soil matrices.  This characteristic, combined with the effective areal sweep or "plug-flow" movement of foams, minimizes the channeling tendencies common to other remediation technologies.
<P>
The foam can be either produced in-situ or injected into the contaminated zone.  Injection/production wells (vertical or horizontal) can be used to assist in delivering, transporting, and monitoring the foams through the subsurface.  The proper selection of foaming agents can aid the delivery of the foam, its sweep front, the foam stability, its efficacy to release NAPLs in the subsurface, and the resultant biodegradability of the foam/NAPL mixture.
<P>
Either aerobic or anaerobic environments can be established in the subsurface, depending on the selection of the carrier gas used to generate the foams.  This enables the foam-pollutant system to be biodegraded adequately for the particular contaminant of concern.  For example, trichloroethylene can be degraded aerobically, while tetrachloroethylene and carbon tetrachloride at the same site must be biodegraded anaerobically.
<P>
It is anticipated that this technology can be applied to both the saturated and vadose zones for remediation of soils contaminated with either chlorinated organics, such as trichloroethylene and carbon tetrachloride, or polyaromatic hydrocarbons, such as chrysene, benz(a)anthracene, anthracene, fluoranthene, or phenanthrene.
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
Argonne's research has elucidated some of the properties for foam flow in unconsolidated porous media at shallow depths.  This information has been integrated into a generic foam-flow model that can be used to design field processes.  Research with test soils has shown that foams remove NAPL-like contaminants 10 times more effectively than do surfactant flushing solutions.  Other aspects of foam-assisted remediation, such as enhanced bacterial transport in porous media, are also being investigated with industrial participants.
<P>
Argonne researchers have found that:

<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
A field demonstration of this technology is planned to begin in fiscal year 1996, given successful research on technical design criteria.
<P>
Argonne researchers have begun applying magnetic resonance imaging to examine pollutant/soil interactions and three-dimensional modeling to predict foam behavior and porous media as an aid to foam control and design.

<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
For decades, the U.S. Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland was the primary center for research, development, and testing of U.S. chemical warfare agents, as well as incendiary materials and munitions.  About 24 buildings in the Edgewood area of Aberdeen - a Superfund site - may soon be scheduled for decommissioning and demolition.  These structures must be characterized, both for chemical warfare agents and for common industrial contaminants.  The extent<BR>
ination is not known.  The best methods of demolition and disposal must be determined.
<P><BR>
Special expertise is required because of the unique nature of the site's potential contaminants and the lack of established procedures for demolishing contaminated buildings.  Argonne National Laboratory's approach focuses on using portable field instruments and mobile laboratory facilities to provide high-quality data efficiently and cost effectively.  The detailed building inspection methodology developed by Argonne is yielding comprehensive, defensible documentation in an area for which no adequate description previously existed.

<B>Argonne is determining the best methods for demolition and disposal of buildings of the U.S. Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground.</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Argonne has begun work to define the scope of the contamination problem, identify specific contaminants, develop appropriate and efficient methods for screening structures for certain substances, execute field measurement programs to determine the true nature of the problem, and develop suitable approaches for decontamination and decommissioning.
<P>
For each contaminated structure, Argonne researchers search historical records, inspect the building in detail, perform a comprehensive site survey, and develop a preliminary risk assessment for demolition.  They are developing a list of key potential contaminants most likely to present environmental and human health problems, as well as methods for screening for these substances.  The researchers have also designed field sampling and measurement programs to determine the true extent of contamination problems.  Finally, they are developing suitable approaches for the decontamination and decommissioning of each structure.
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
All buildings of concern at Aberdeen have been inspected.  Two detailed inspection reports have been published and others are in preparation.  Reports are available on the findings of the geophysical surveys taken for the area.  A preliminary risk assessment has been completed for one building that serves as a prototype for others.  Initial sampling has been conducted for nine relatively simple buildings.  Preliminary results show that two of the nine are free from significant contamination; data for the remainder are being analyzed.
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Field measurement and sampling will be conducted on the remaining, more complex buildings.  Results will be incorporated into risk assessments and used to develop recommendations for decontamination and decommissioning options.  Eventually, a contractor will apply Argonne's data and evaluation to perform the actual demolition.

<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
Encroachment of saline water into fresh water aquifers on the Louisiana Gulf Coast has traditionally been attributed to surface processes.  Hurricanes, rising sea levels, and the dredging of deepwater canals have been seen as the lateral transport mechanisms of getting salt water into the interior of these wetlands.  However, a vertical transport mechanism has been identified  upward, periodic release of saline fluids from deep aquifers to shallow aquifers along regional growth faults.  This vertical transport mechanism has important ramifications to the petroleum, gas, transportation, and other sectors that have an investment in infrastructure that could suffer from increased subsidence accompanying these faults.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/saltwatr.gif"><BR>
<P>
<B>Areas where salt water has been detected beyond the Baton Rouge fault.</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
A more exact knowledge of active subsidence areas, which are not apparent from the marsh surface, would benefit all interested parties in the region.  Pipelines, bridges, and roads could be located in more stable areas.  An oil production company might be able to demonstrate, during litigation, that natural processes caused local subsidence, not its drilling activity.  And petroleum geologists might better understand the role of faulting in the migration of hydrocarbons beneath these and similar delta terranes.
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Differences in chloride concentrations have been determined in aquifers straddling a known fault zone (the Baton Rouge Fault).  These findings support the theory that saline waters are fed into fresh marsh terranes from deep, geopressured zones and that these terranes and associated waters are compartmentalized into blocks.  Additional support for fault compartmentalization came from deep research boreholes, surface vegetation mapping, satellite imagery, and other sources.  Argonne research staff utilized an extensive database of existing seismic records to map the location where faults intersect with the surface.  The team proceeded under the assumption that these faults and fault-bound compartments were hydrologically distinct and could be mapped with non-invasive electromagnetic technology.
<P>
In November 1994, Argonne research staff made a reconnaissance trip to southern Louisiana to determine if an electromagnetic sounding technique could map salinity regimes compartmentalized by faults.  Results indicated that the hydrology of these wetlands is much more complicated than the simple diffusion model endorsed by the U.S. Geological Survey.
<P>
Electromagnetics is a non-invasive, inexpensive method for gathering framework data in these wetlands.  Bulk conductivity represents a cumulative electromagnetic response from the surface to the effective depth of the tool.  In this case, the effective depths of response were 15, 30, and 60 meters.  The study indicated that the deep 60-meter values best defined the aquifers on each side of the fault.  Investigations up to 600 meters in depth are possible with time domain electromagnetics (TDEM).
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
A Ph.D. dissertation and several publications by an Argonne staff member have focused on the relationship of seismically mapped faults to subsidence phenomena in southern Louisiana.  The followup investigation demonstrated the ability of electromagnetics techniques to map these same faults.
<P>
The electromagnetic technique used by Argonne is simple to apply.  A preliminary hydrogeologic investigation across two parishes was accomplished in a week.
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
A work proposal is being prepared to continue these investigations down to 600 meters by using TDEM.  Several strategically placed deep borings will be used to field calibrate the TDEM data set.

<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
Toxic organic and inorganic contaminants in waste streams generated by chemical, metallurgical, and other industries must be destroyed or removed before the waste streams are released to the environment.  The activities of the DOE alone could generate more than 200,000 m3 of aqueous mixed waste, contaminated with both toxic organics and metals, that would require treatment over the next 20 years.
<P>
Many researchers have undertaken extensive studies of photocatalytic techniques assisted by titanium dioxide (TiO2) for the removal of organic and inorganic contaminants from aqueous waste streams.  These techniques have been proven effective for oxidative destruction of the most resistant organic compounds and for reduction of several heavy metals.  However, reduction of toxic heavy metal ions, such as lead (Pb2+), had not been reported.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/look.gif"><BR>
<P>
<B>Argonne's technology holds promise for remediating groundwater contaminated with long-lived radioactive materials.</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
Successful application of the technology would enable removal, detoxification, and recovery of heavy metals, along with the destruction of organics in combined waste streams.  This would represent a significant breakthrough for the treatment of heavy-metal-contaminated waters at DOE and industrial sites.  By recovering the metals in metallic form, heavy-metal toxicity is minimized, and the number of steps required for recovery is reduced.
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Basic research on surface modification of colloidal TiO2, which was conducted by Argonne National Laboratory's Chemistry Division, is being applied by Argonne's Energy Systems Division to develop materials that effectively remove lead and mercury ions from aqueous solutions.  The goal is to develop an industrial process for selective heavy-metal recovery and simultaneous removal of organic and metal contaminants from aqueous waste streams.
<P>
Argonne chemists are using metal-binding peptides and related mercapto-reagents to modify the particle surface of TiO2 colloids.  Surface modification enhances the reduction properties of conduction band electrons, yielding materials that are selectively optimized for photochemical reactivity towards toxic metal ions.  In parallel research, Energy Systems engineers and scientists are conducting batch, bench-scale experiments on aqueous solutions containing various metal and organic contaminants to determine process kinetics and optimal treatment conditions.
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
Preliminary results indicate that in solutions containing lead only, the surface-modified catalyst reduces lead ions effectively.  In lead-phenol and lead-naphthalene solutions, the presence of lead has little effect on phenol or naphthalene degradation.  Phenol does not appear to affect removal of lead ions significantly.  Naphthalene, however, by absorbing ultraviolet light, interferes with the illumination of colloid particles and deters the photocatalytic process.  Reduction in lead concentration is delayed until a significant portion of naphthalene is degraded.
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Argonne researchers will design methods for metal and catalyst recovery and will test other compounds for surface modification of TiO2 colloid particles.  Systems and economic analyses will be performed, and a continuous flow treatment process will be designed and tested.

Argonne National Laboratory scientists, working with the Gas Research Institute, are using advanced computer technology to reduce the time and effort required for gathering and assessing the data needed to site and obtain permits for gas pipeline rights-of way (ROWs).

<B>Approach </B>
<P>
Computerized geographic information systems (GISs) combine a wide variety of spatial data for the area of interest -- population centers, land cover, endangered species habitats, wetlands, hydrography, soils, and transportation routes -- that provide information associated with siting, permitting, construction, maintenance, and monitoring of pipeline ROWs.  Using this information, weighted map layers are created and used as input into a GIS least-cost analysis.  Weights are assigned to geographic areas  on the basis of environmental and engineering characteristics.  Least-cost analyses are then performed to produce a route for the ROW, or even several alternative routes, that avoid environmentally sensitive areas or areas with severe engineering constraints.  Alternative routes can be created quickly and easily by varying the weights assigned to the input layers, either by including or excluding specific categories or by changing the actual weights assigned to each category.  
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
By using this approach, unavoidable impacts on preferred routes  can be identified and quantified early in the route selection process.  This allows for the design of mitigation measures and their presentation to regulators early in the permitting process.  This approach to planning pipeline routes will save the industry both time and money.  The GIS modeling results are typically obtained in less than a year, and it is expected that this period will be shortened further as digital data become more available.
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Further research may be needed to determine the model's sensitivity to various input categories and their assigned costs.  In addition, decision support analysis tools would greatly  improve the process of assigning weights.  Coupling of GIS with other methods, including statistical and physical analyses, also needs to be investigated.  GIS may be coupled to physical models in the areas of hydrology, geology, transportation, storage, and production.  Available models need to be investigated for their compatibility with GIS and with the interfaces defined and established in this study.

<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
Produced water is salty wastewater that is brought to the surface during production of natural gas.  Although the wastewater's constituents occur naturally, they are considered contaminants and must be treated.  Varying widely in concentration, these constituents include salt, organic compounds, and, in some cases, heavy metals and trace elements.  A common disposal method is deep well injection; its cost depends on the volume of wastewater injected.  What is needed is a simple treatment technique that reduces wastewater volume and removes contaminants.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/jerryroots.gif"><BR>
<P>
<B>Argonne scientists are investigating several plant-based approaches for treating the salty wastewater that is brought to that surface along with natural gas from gas wells.</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Argonne has developed a low-cost, low-tech method for cleaning up wastewater and reducing the volume of produced water.  Based on phytoremediation, the method uses green plants in an engineered plant ecosystem modeled on natural wetland ecosystems.  The "ideal" phytoremediation plant would be a large, vigorous, salt-tolerant grass or grasslike species having a large area of aboveground leaves and stems and a dense, fibrous root system to act as a biological filter.
<P>
Large, green plants can move copious amounts of water through their roots and into the plant body.  This water is evaporated from the leaves as pure water vapor - a process called transpiration.  When selected, adapted plants are grown in contaminated wastewater by hydroponic techniques, and the root system functions as a biological filter. Contaminants taken up along with the water are degraded, metabolized, and/or stored in the plant body.  Transpiration is enhanced by maximizing the leaf/stem area of the plant.  Contaminant concentrations in plants can become thousands of times higher than those in the wastewater.  The contaminated plant biomass can be digested or burned to reduce its volume.  The residue can be processed to recover the contaminant, if valuable, or disposed of in environmentally appropriate ways.
<P>
Phytoremediation offers several major advantages over competing physico-chemical technologies (e.g., ion exchange).  One advantage is the ability of selected plant species to adsorb contaminant ions from an extremely broad range of concentrations.  Another advantage is selectivity. Selected plants have the ability to adsorb the target contaminant while ignoring other ions in solution.  Other important advantages of phytoremediation:  It is low-cost and low-tech.
<P>
<B>Status</B>
<P>
Promising processes and plant species that were identified during the literature review and database development phases have been evaluated in greenhouse experiments.  Over 80 species have been screened for salt tolerance and high evapotranspiration rates.   For six species, detailed experimental data have been generated on transpiration rates, salt tolerance, nutrient requirements, and maximum salt concentration at which effective transpiration occurs.  Transpiration rates are consistently above open-water evaporation rates at a saline concentration of at least 2% salt in the nutrient solution.  For several species, these high evapotranspiration rates have been maintained up to 6% salinity.
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
An experimental batch-processing bioreactor with two compartments will be assembled in 1995 to simulate planned pilot and field installations.  Each downstream compartment will process wastewater of increasing salinity with different plant species.  The goal is to reduce the volume of saline production wastewater by 75% in less than eight days.

<H2>Wetland Corridors Program Details Environmental Impacts of Pipelines</H2>
</TD>

<P>
<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
The possible impact that pipeline construction and maintenance can have on wetlands is a sensitive issue.  Until now, there have been few quantitative data to guide the regulatory community and the natural gas industry in restoring pipeline corridors to their original condition.  The recent emphasis on "no net loss" of wetlands, with resulting wetland banking strategies, has imposed both financial burdens and uncertainty on pipeline companies in planning the future development of pipeline rights-of-way (ROWs).  Documented studies are needed to define the type, significance, and duration of environmental consequences associated with past pipeline practices.
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Argonne National Laboratory's field team of botanists, ecologists, engineers, and soil scientists conducted one-time surveys of 13 wetland crossings and two surveys each on two wetland crossings for eight different pipelines throughout the eastern, midwestern, and southern United States between 1990 and 1992.  The communities chosen represented a diversity of wetland types, installation techniques, and maintenance practices.   A taxonomist, specializing in local flora, joined the team at each site.   At the time of the surveys, the wetland crossings ranged in age from 1 to 31 years.  Data were collected on the vegetation that became established on the ROWs and in adjacent, undisturbed wetlands.  The percent of area coverage collected for each species on the ROW and on adjacent wetlands was used to evaluate similarities and differences between plant communities.  Changes to topography, soils, and hydrology attributable to ROW construction were documented, along with impacts on rare, threatened, endangered, or sensitive species.  The study verified that current environmental regulations and pipeline technology are effective in limiting undesirable impacts to wetlands.  The current recommendation to seed wetland ROWs annually with ryegrass is not necessary and may only serve to delay establishment of native vegetation. 
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/wetlands.gif"><BR>
<P>
<B>Argonne's study of wetland areas shows little evidence of environmental degradation by pipelines.</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
The results indicated that ROWs installed under recent wetland regulations normally are revegetated within a few years after site closure with dense, diverse plant life similar to that in adjacent natural areas.  These plant communities have propagated from naturally available species without special soil treatment or artificial seeding.  Traditional maintenance by periodic mowing has been successful in allowing an herb stratum to develop.
<P>
While ROWs encourage plant and habitat diversity for wetlands, there is no evidence that they degrade wetlands by encouraging the growth or spread of invasive, non-native plant species.  Most negative impacts are short-term, diminishing with time.  Older ROWs, developed before current regulations went into effect, had fewer positive results than those developed within the last several years.
<P>
Natural gas pipeline companies recognize the Wetland Corridors Program as a unique data bank on wetland recovery.  
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
One pipeline company has approached Argonne to survey some of its wetland crossings in similar fashion and compare the findings with the previously established data bank.  Continuous studies are needed to document more precisely the duration of observed effects, the impacts of recent regulations limiting maintenance to only the central portion of ROWs, and further comparisons of directional drilling and open trenching.  Studies are also needed to document potential fragmentation of various habitats and identify techniques to avoid this condition.

<B>Problem/Opportunity </B>
<P>
Using vehicles powered by fuels other than gasoline is one way to displace imported petroleum and reduce exhaust emissions (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen oxides) that contribute to air pollution and global warming.  Federal law requires that alternative-fuel vehicles (AFVs) be included in government automobile fleets beginning in 1993, in state and fuel provider fleets in 1996, and potentially in municipal and private fleets beginning in 1999.  There are numerous types of AFVs from which fleet owners may choose.  The difficulty lies in knowing which will best meet the owner's needs.
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach </B>
<P>
To help fleet owners decide which vehicles to buy, Argonne National Laboratory and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory are building a database of information on AFVs.  The information in the database is collected in moving laboratories - the test vehicles Argonne employees drive at the laboratory's Illinois site.  With 60 vehicles, Argonne's Center for Transportation Research (CTR) is the nation's largest alternative-fuel fleet demonstration center and the only one with all models of OEM-produced vehicles.  Argonne employees use the AFVs in their daily work, which is as varied as hauling equipment and driving to meetings.  Thus, the information is collected under real-life operating conditions.  The information gathered about the daily performance of these vehicles aids not only federal agencies that will purchase these types of vehicles,  but car makers and others as well. 
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/Car.gif"><BR>
<P>
<B>Argonne natural gas vehicle</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
Argonne's fleet includes vehicles powered by methanol (alcohol derived from natural gas or biomass), ethanol (alcohol made from grain or biomass), and natural gas.  The alcohol-fuel vehicles are flexible-fuel vehicles that can use any mix of gasoline and alcohol without modifications.  Because the alternative fuels are available on site, the vehicles primarily use alternative fuels.
<P>
Argonne's alternative-fuels fleet includes mid- and full-sized sedans, burning either ethanol or methanol, and vans using natural gas.  Gasoline-powered vehicles of the same type are used to gather comparison data.  Argonne's approach is unique in that the data are collected on a trip-by-trip basis, so that performance over the entire driving cycle can be examined. Thus, researchers can capture the differences between performance on 10 short trips as opposed to one longer one with the same total mileage.
<P>
Data collection focuses on the vehicles' driveability, reliability, and fuel efficiency, but other operational characteristics peculiar to AFVs are also being observed and documented.  Argonne is analyzing additional information on performance, driveability, and emissions for a more precise evaluation of how various vehicles and types of fuels perform in different kinds of weather.   
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
Since the experiment began in August 1992, over 280,000 miles have been accumulated.  In an earlier study begun in 1986 and concluded in 1991, Argonne drivers logged more than 1 million miles in dedicated methanol-fueled vehicles. Information from the experiment is available to researchers on the Alternative Fuels Center database.
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans </B>
<P>
Additional alternative-fuel vehicles will be added as they come into the federal fleet.  Three methanol-calibrated, flexible-fuel Dodge Intrepids were added in spring 1995, including one designated to use E85 (85% ethanol and 15% hydrocarbons), an Argonne exclusive.  In a research partnership based on the CTR's acknowledged leadership in AFV testing, Chrysler engineers are allowing a special field test of some Intrepids using E85.

<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
Reducing the curb weight of automobiles can significantly increase fuel economy.  Decreased petroleum consumption, in turn, will improve the nation's balance of trade, increase jobs and gross domestic product, and reduce the environmental impact of fuel combustion and production.  The use of lightweight materials allows automakers to decrease the weight of an automobile without decreasing its size.  Advances in lightweight materials, coupled with design improvements and improved joining technology, will help assure that crashworthiness and handling characteristics in lighter cars are the same as in heavier automobiles.  The part of the automobile with the greatest opportunity for weight reduction is the body itself.  The competition among materials developers - primarily makers of steel, aluminum, and polymer matrix composites (PMC) - is fierce.  Therefore, a program to evaluate lightweight materials that is based on independent analysis and has clear program objectives and a well-thought-out implementation plan is critical to ensure that R&D dollars are used effectively.
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Argonne's Center for Transportation Research is helping the DOE determine the potential benefits of a lightweight materials program.  By using a macroeconomic model developed by Argonne researchers, impacts of lightweight vehicle production on Gross Domestic Product, jobs, and balance of trade are estimated.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/lwv.gif"><BR>
<P>
<B>Aluminum and other lightweight materials have a significant role to play in improving the performance and fuel economy of passenger cars and trucks. Argonne is evaluating an all-aluminum car body for Ford Motor Co.</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
Argonne's approach is to estimate the vehicle life-cycle and determine the vehicle's energy, environmental, and economic impacts, assuming that aluminum and PMC materials are used extensively in the body.  First, the weight, materials composition, and fuel economy of a baseline steel vehicle are delineated.  Next, from an extensive literature search and interviews, aluminum-intensive and PMC-intensive vehicles are characterized.  The costs of the lightweight vehicles are assumed to differ from those of the baseline steel vehicle because of the additional cost of the materials themselves.  Next, a vehicle-choice model is used to simulate the competition between lightweight and conventional vehicles and to determine the vehicle mix.  From total vehicle sales projections and vehicle fuel economy estimates, total fuel consumption is estimated. Embodied energy in the materials is estimated from an extensive Argonne database of materials production and recycling energy consumption.  Estimated changes in total energy use are plotted over time.  From fuel consumption data, changes in greenhouse gas emissions and criteria pollutants are also plotted.

Preliminary results indicate that lightweight materials (such as aluminum and high-performance PMCs) have the potential to boost the fuel economy of vehicles, making it feasible for manufacturers to increase their corporate average fuel economy, even when larger vehicles are in demand.  By using aluminum, significant life-cycle energy savings are projected in the 2010-2030 period, assuming an incremental cost of no more than about $800 to $1,200 per vehicle, but realizing these savings will require improvements in forming, joining, and recycling technologies.  Very high cost is an impediment to the market penetration of high-performance PMC-intensive vehicles.  A breakthrough in manufacturing processes and low-cost polymer synthesis is required.  The product mix and pricing strategies are important.  For example, the replacement of conventional-material automobiles with more expensive lightweight versions, prompting buyers to shift to light trucks and vans, would hurt overall fleet fuel economy.
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Argonne researchers are completing the analysis, and results will be available in mid-summer 1995.  Plans call for the analysis to be expanded to include other lightweight materials and engines.

<P>
The United States continues to consume more than one-fourth of the world's oil production.  The transportation sector currently accounts for approximately two-thirds of all U.S. petroleum use and roughly one-fourth of total U.S. energy consumption.  A virtual one-to-one relationship exists between additional gasoline consumption and America's increased use of imported oil.  Clearly, any effort to decrease the use of oil hinges on reducing its use in transportation.  By displacing imported oil with domestically produced alternative fuels, Americans could help to reduce the trade deficit, create jobs, and promote economic activity.
<P>
On the environmental front, many Americans living in metropolitan areas around the country face possible chronic damage to their health from long-term exposure to air pollutants.  Emissions from the 190 million cars and trucks in this country account for about half of all air pollution and more than 80% of all urban air pollution.  New domestic sources of power for vehicles and new vehicle technologies could reduce emissions and provide cleaner air to breathe.

<B><I>AfterShock</I>, an award-winning HEV built by students at University of California, Davis, set a mileage record in October 1994, driving 440 miles from Los Angeles to Sacramento using only a single battery charge and 5.7 gallons of gasoline, while averaging 77 mpg.</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
Federal legislation (the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments and the Energy Policy Act of 1992) is encouraging the use of alternatives to conventional gasoline and diesel fuels.  Both auto manufacturers and the oil industry will be affected.
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Since 1987, the DOE has sponsored 28 different college and high school engineering competitions through Argonne National Laboratory.  These competitions help to accelerate the domestic development of alternative-fuel-vehicle technology.  Federal funding for the competitions is heavily leveraged by industry contributions, reflecting the high value industry places on the competitions.  
<P>
These competitions emphasize current or future vehicle technology;  students work with production vehicles (donated by domestic vehicle manufacturers) to meet emissions standards, while maintaining high performance and fuel economy.  Auto industry experts judge events, interact with students, and compare technologies.  The competitions program represents a unique international coalition of government and industry aimed at eliminating technical and institutional barriers to acceptance of alternative fuels.  
<P>
<P>
<B>Program Objectives</B>
<UL>
<LI>Advance the state of the art in fuel systems and power trains and document student designs and vehicle accomplishments.</LI>
<LI>Inform and educate the public about alternative-fuel technologies.
<LI>Obtain industry participation to improve the relationship between DOE and industry, other government agencies, and academia.</LI>
<LI>Support innovations and ongoing research resulting from involvement in these competitions (see "Results").</LI>
<LI>Increase students' engineering knowledge through work on "real world" problems outside of the classroom.</LI>
<LI>Provide students with hands-on experience, which often results in opportunities for automotive industry employment.</LI>
<LI>Excite students about careers in science.  The high school events have interested many students in science careers.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
Competition vehicles have exceeded the toughest foreseeable emission 
standards while improving fuel economy, performance, and driveability.

<LI>More than 120 student papers and over 10 Argonne technical papers have been published.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
In 1995, 10 DOE-sponsored competitions will take place, involving electric, hybrid-electric, solar, and alternative-fuel vehicles.  A new competition, FutureCar Challenge, sponsored in conjunction with USCAR, comprised of Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors, is now being planned for 1996.

<H2>Electric Vehicle Total Energy Cycle Assessment Identifies Potential Environmental Problems</H2>

<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
Electric vehicles (EVs) help reduce oil imports and, potentially, greenhouse gas emissions, as well as improve air quality.  But, EVs are only one of several technologies that do so.  Total energy cycle analyses can be used to compare, from a complete system perspective, the environmental emissions, residuals, and total energy use of competing methods of providing energy services for similar end uses.  Such a comparison will make it possible to select the best means of reducing U.S. oil imports, greenhouse gas emissions, and air pollution without causing unintended impacts on the environment.  
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
The DOE is sponsoring several total energy cycle assessments (TECAs), including one for electric vehicles, the EVTECA. Argonne National Laboratory, through its Center for Transportation Research, is one of three national laboratories participating in the EVTECA.  TECAs examine the environmental effects of energy systems. They consider all energy-cycle stages, including raw material extraction, material transportation, conversion to an energy form (e.g., electricity), transportation of the energy form, and end use. The entire life cycle of each stage is included: construction and/or manufacturing, operation, and post-operation (e.g., disposal).
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/singh.gif"><BR>
<P>
<B>EVTECAs consider all energy-cycle stages.</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
In the EVTECA, an emissions and residuals inventory of electric vehicles is being developed, as well as an inventory for comparable conventional vehicles fueled by reformulated gasoline (RFG). The emissions and residuals associated with vehicle and battery manufacturing, battery recycling and disposal, vehicle operation, electricity generation, production of RFG, and extraction and transport of feedstock for electricity and RFG will be included. Several scenarios of EV market penetration for the years 2000 and 2010 have been developed. EV use is being evaluated in four metropolitan areas with different utility fuel mixes, climate, transportation patterns, and environmental regulations. The regions selected for analysis are Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, and Washington, D.C. The scenarios also vary in terms of battery types, vehicle types, vehicle use patterns, and EV charging schedules.
<P>
The results of the scenario analysis are being incorporated into a total energy cycle analysis model, TEMIS (Total Emissions Model of Integrated Systems). The model will be used to estimate the emissions and residuals associated with electric and conventional vehicle use on a per vehicle mile of travel (VMT) basis. Both the scenario results and the per-VMT results will be presented in the final technical report of the project.
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
The project is well under way. Much of the battery, vehicle, and RFG characterization has been completed and submitted for external peer review. Argonne has prepared draft papers on the following topics: the selection of battery and electric vehicle types for inclusion in the assessment; EV performance characteristics, EV battery recharging patterns, energy use and emissions associated with producing and recycling EV batteries, vehicle travel patterns in the four study areas and selection of driving cycles for simulation of electric and conventional vehicle performance, estimates of energy consumption of electric and conventional vehicles, conventional-vehicle operating emissions, emissions associated with production of RFG, and projections of annual EV sales and stock. 
<P>
Base-case utility dispatch for the four regions has been simulated, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory has completed an analysis of EV impacts assuming unconstrained charging and peak-shift charging in selected seasons, but the analysis is not yet available for review. 
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
The final products of this study will include a technical report documenting the estimates of the emissions and residuals of the total energy cycle of EVs and comparable conventional vehicles. The TEMIS output will be made available in a spreadsheet format. A policy-oriented report will be developed outlining the policy and R&D implications of the EVTECA.

<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
The Energy Policy Act of 1992 required the DOE's Office of Transportation Technologies to develop a multiyear research plan.  With an office-wide Strategic Program Planning initiative already in progress, the challenge was to integrate efforts to respond to this congressional requirement. 
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
The staff of Argonne National Laboratory's Center for Transportation Research developed a research plan and assembled a multidisciplinary team of researchers to provide quick-response technical, engineering, and economic analysis services. The effort was planned as an inter-laboratory activity, including the participation of personnel at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the University of Tennessee.
<P>
A key element of the research approach involved the use of comprehensive computer analysis techniques that provided definitive projections of energy savings and environmental and economic benefits of the advanced transportation technologies. Market-penetration estimates from the Alternative Vehicle Sales (AVS) model developed by DOE provided inputs to Argonne's Integrated Market Penetration and Anticipated Cost of Transportation Technologies (IMPACTT) and Argonne Multisector Industry Growth Assessment (AMIGA) models. The models were used to generate estimates of the reductions in petroleum use and criteria air pollutants, as well as increases in the Gross Domestic Product and employment benefits. An iterative approach was used to develop the research plan, with frequent submissions and close coordination with the sponsor.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/transtech.gif">
</CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
A comprehensive draft of the plan was developed and submitted for review and comment within six weeks of the start of work. Subsequent submittals were provided after comments were received from Office of Transportation Technologies staff, industry peers, senior DOE management and general counsel, the Office of Management and Budget, and other federal agencies.  The plan was transmitted to Congress in August 1994.
<P>
The methodology and results were also used by DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy for several ongoing technology assessment and program evaluation efforts, as well as for other submissions required by the 1992 Energy Policy Act.
<P>
Projections show that OTT's programs could boost Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by $583 billion by 2020.  As indicated in the accompanying table, the benefits will accrue from growth in the GDP resulting from reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and oil use and a projected decrease in the world price of oil due to the use of advances in transportation technology.
<P>
<P> 
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
The planning methodology has been updated and is currently being applied to office program assessment and development efforts.

<H2>National Maglev Initiative Evaluates and Develops System Design Concepts for Mass Transportation</H2>

<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
By 1975, sufficient R&D had been accomplished in the United States and abroad to establish the technical feasibility of using maglev technology for mass transportation applications.  (In fact, the first U.S. patent for a maglev system suitable for transportation applications was granted earlier, in 1968.)  However, while the Germans and Japanese continued vigorous R&D on this technology, U.S. funding was discontinued after 1975.  By 1989-90, both Germany and Japan had achieved advanced stages in their maglev development programs, and both had prototype test vehicles running on test guideways.  But since no commercial maglev system was as yet deployed, there remained an opportunity for the United States to re-emerge as an international competitor.
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Following publication of landmark maglev studies performed by U.S. Senator Moynihan's Technology Advisory Committee and Argonne National Laboratory in 1989, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and DOE, together with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, jointly formed the National Maglev Initiative (NMI) in FY 1990.  The program was initiated in part due to the growing concern that the demand for fast, energy-efficient, and environmentally friendly transportation was rapidly outpacing the existing system's capacity.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/nmi.gif"><BR>
<P>
<B>Maglev technology addresses the need for fast, energy-efficient, and environmentally friendly mass transportation in the United States.</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
This federally funded project investigated the state of the art in maglev system design, developed U.S. maglev system design concepts, evaluated them relative to existing transportation systems, determined the economic feasibility of developing and implementing such systems in the United States, and examined what role the federal government should play in their development and implementation.
<P>
By the time the NMI was started in FY 1990, formation of a strong maglev technical team was already well under way at Argonne.  The team consisted of transportation experts, physicists, and electrical and mechanical engineers, one of whom had served as a project leader for the first federally funded maglev program in the early 1970s.  Funding from the Laboratory, the state of Illinois, and the DOE helped to build that team and its level of expertise in maglev technology.
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
During subsequent years, Argonne made many contributions to the NMI program.  Argonne's maglev team produced more than 70 reports and papers and a number of invention disclosures from 1988-95. Five patents have been awarded, and a sixth application was recently submitted.
<P>
The Laboratory participated in various program planning, management, and coordinating committees and helped government agencies evaluate contractor proposals and monitor technical progress on awarded contracts.  In addition, through government-sponsored in-house R&D, the Argonne team, building on the earlier maglev work done in the United States and abroad, developed laboratory experimental techniques and used them to help develop new computer codes and validate both old and new codes.  Argonne's acquired expertise and analytical tools were then applied to verifying and evaluating contractors' results.
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Federal support for the NMI was drastically reduced in FY 1994 and virtually eliminated in FY 1995.  Despite these actions, Argonne staff continue to work in the maglev field, although at a reduced level.  During FY 1994, both the Army Corps of Engineers and the FRA provided support to Argonne to continue in-house R&D and offer technical support where needed.  In FY 1995, the FRA provided funds to Argonne to help conduct its congressionally mandated Commercial Feasibility Study (CFS), expected to be submitted to Congress this summer.

<H2>Providing Unbiased Information on Alternative-Fuel Vehicles to the American Public</H2>

<P>
<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
Using vehicles powered by fuels other than gasoline is one way to displace imported petroleum and minimize exhaust emissions (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides) that contribute to air pollution and global warming.  To reduce America's reliance on imported petroleum, the Energy Policy Act (EPACT) of 1992  requires that alternative-fuel vehicles (AFVs) be included in government automobile fleets beginning in 1993, in state and fuel provider fleets in 1996, and potentially in municipal and private fleets beginning in 1999.  
<P>
To promote the use of vehicles that run on nonpetroleum fuels, Section 405 of EPACT requires that the DOE, in conjunction with appropriate federal agencies and other individuals and organizations, establish "...a public information program on the benefits and costs of the use of alternative fuels in motor vehicles."  Furthermore, DOE is required  "...to produce and make available an (annually updated) information package for consumers to assist them in choosing among alternative fuels and alternative-fueled vehicles."  
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Argonne National Laboratory was asked to develop a public information program on alternative fuels and alternative-fueled vehicles.  Target audiences and outreach strategies were consistent with, but differ somewhat from, those which have evolved under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, specifically the Clean Fuels Program.  
<P>
As a key element in Argonne's approach to this task, Argonne and DOE gained early and ongoing participation of stakeholders (those with a vested interest in the fuels and vehicles market)  and technical oversight panels during the development of promotion and outreach materials.  In all materials, alternative fuel and AFV characteristics are to be compared to those associated with gasoline and evaluated on a life-cycle basis.  The materials are designed to provide relevant and objective information on a variety of alternative fuel and AFV characteristics, including:
<UL>
<LI>Environmental performance
<LI>Energy efficiency
<LI>Domestic content
<LI>Cost
<LI>Maintenance requirements
<LI>Reliability
<LI>Safety.
</UL>
<P>
The Section 405 program is using three broad approaches in support of petroleum displacement goals.  First, the program provides information that will make it easier for affected fleets to comply with AFV mandates.  Second, whereas it is generally recognized that even the fullest application of fleet AFV mandates will be insufficient to achieve all petroleum displacement goals, the program can provide information that encourages voluntary commitments to purchase AFVs, supplementing the mandates.  Third, program efforts to measure effectiveness provide feedback that can be used to adjust not only Section 405 program plans, but related programs as well.  
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
Early in the program, it became apparent that no single group interested in promoting increased alternative fuels or AFV sales is likely to be taken seriously without consistent and unambiguous support of its specific message by other influential agents, and that a key aspect of any outreach program should be constant monitoring and promotion of fleet-owned AFVs as they reach the end of their commercial service cycle.
<P>
Because fleets are the first audience segment to face requirements for alternative fuels and AFVs acquisition, a 32-page document targeted at this segment was published in June 1994.  The brochure has been very well received by its targeted audience.  To date, about 45,000 copies have been distributed.
<P>
Information on alternative fuels and AFVs was distributed through DOE's Public Information Exhibit at the 1995 New York Auto Show and the 1995 National Association of Fleet Administrators Fleet Institute Exposition.  The exhibit also participated in the Air & Waste Management Association's 88th Annual Meeting & Exhibition in June 1995.  
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
The scope and quantity of outreach materials and efforts is expected to expand over the next several years.

"What I have learned from orangutans is that we humans must not turn
our backs on our own biological heritage. Modern society promotes the
ideal of the rugged individual. For men you have the Clint Eastwood
persona--the Marlborough Man. For women you have single moms raising
their kids alone. The ideal Western male rides into town, fights the
bad guys, falls in love, and then heads off into the sunset. He is
strong and solitary just like an orangutan but he represents an
evolutionary dead-end. Many of today's problems are a result of
abandoning our human biological roots. We must look to  our
distinctive gregarious human heritage; living and working in family
groups and communities if we want to be successful. Otherwise we are
just stressed out 'orangutans' in an urban setting."</I></B>

<HR NOSHADE>
<P>
The sweat pours down her face. She feels thirsty, not so much hungry.
Swatting at mosquitoes, Dr. Birute Galdikas balances on a slippery
log--"The logs are always slippery. I don't know why, but they always
are"--trying to avoid the thorn vines and toxic bark in the dark dank
<A HREF="http://www.ran.org/ran/">rainforest</A>. She stands waist-deep in tea-coloured swamp water, her
joggers and jeans soaking wet. Two pairs of socks, one tucked under
and one over the jeans keep out leeches and other unspeakable menaces
of the bog. She's wearing a khaki long sleeved shirt with lots of
pockets and a cotton jungle hat she bought at an army surplus store.<P>

<IMG SRC="galdikas-small.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT>
<P>
Catching her breath, she spots two magnificent humongous male
orangutans standing face to face, glaring at each other's massive
cheek pads. They are ready to fight for the chance to mate with the
female that Galdikas has been tracking for days. Actually, she can
only glimpse their shifting shadowy forms in the dense foliage. The
sounds are horrific: snarling, grunting, loud and frightening. They
wrestle and tumble, smashing through the brush, trying to bite each
other on the head and shoulders until one flees into the bush. Moving
forward to see, Galdikas snaps a twig distracting the other one.
Suddenly, he grabs two thick vines, swings down until he hangs only a
metre above her head and stares into her eyes, so close that her
nostrils tingle from the stale odour of orangutan sweat.<P>

In 22 years of jungle observations, she's had only a handful of such
close encounters, so rare are orangutan's meetings with humans or even
their fellow apes. But this fellow's message was clear: "Leave me
alone."<P>

Galdikas has learned more than any other human being about what it
means to be an orangutan, and the cardinal fact is that they like to
be left alone. An adult male's range is at least 40 square kilometres
and he can spend weeks loping slowly from tree to tree eating fruits,
nuts, insects, leaves and bark without ever meeting any of his kin.<P>

"I've always wanted to study the one primate who never left the Garden
of Eden," says Galdikas. "I want to know what we left behind."<P>

Her conclusion: our biologically recent developments of complex
tool-making, language, and social institutions have removed us from
the slow paced, isolated but extremely stable lifestyle of our
prehistoric ancestors in the 'garden'. And we must not forsake these
evolutionary roots, for it is only our distinctly human social ties
that can keep our natural animal greed in check, preserve our
environment and maintain our mental well being.<P>

<B>History</B><P>

When Birute was 12 years old she loved to go into the wilder sections
of High Park in Toronto and pretend she was a Huron or Iroquois native
slipping through the woods, at one with nature. She would spend hours
like this, quietly and secretly observing the wild animals in the
park. Ever since she was 5, Birute wondered where human beings came
from. She knew they evolved from a common ancestor of monkeys and
apes but she wanted to know more. She<P>
<UL>
<LI> Got university degrees in psychology and anthropology.
<LI> Went to meet Louis Leakey and got his support to set up an orangutan
research station in Borneo.
<LI> Lived in the jungle observing orangutans for 23 years.
<LI> <A HREF="http://www.ns.net/orangutan/president.html">Founded orangutan support groups all over the world.</A>

<FONT SIZE="+2"><I><TD><B>The Science</B></I></FONT>
<HR NOSHADE>

<A HREF="http://www.bcyellowpages.com/advert/b/BCHES/dr.htm">Birute Galdikas</A> is the world's leading expert on orangutans, the great
apes that live in the rain-forests of Borneo. She is an
Anthropologist. Anthropology is the study of human beings, but
Galdikas is looking to the great apes who decended from a common
ancestor to help understand the mysteries of human nature.<P>

When she was 22, Galdikas met Dr. Louis Leakey who is famous for
discovering fossils of early humans in Africa. Leakey and the National
Geographic Society helped Galdikas set up a research camp in Borneo to
study orangutans. Although she grew up in Toronto and spends several
months a year teaching in Vancouver at SFU, Galdikas has been living
in the rainforest among the orangutans for the last 23 years.<P>

<IMG SRC="galdikas_orangutan.gif" ALIGN="left">

<H3>1. The Rainforest</H3>
The tropical rainforest is one of the most stable ecosystems on the
planet. A huge variety of plants and animals thrive there, and nothing
has changed for millions of years. This is why the common ancestor for
all apes including humans may have been somewhat like an orangutan.
Orangutans have no serious predators except humans. Their dietary
knowledge of the irregular fruiting patterns of tropical plants
highlights their intelligence. It also explains their solitary
lifestyle and the eight-year interval between births. A big animal
needs a lot of foraging territory without too many others around.<P>

<H3>2. Structural Brachiators</H3>
Orangutans are structural brachiators which means they are built to
swing from branches with their upper limbs, but they have become too
heavy to move quickly like this. Adult orangutans are the largest
tree-dwelling animals on earth, averaging about 100 kilograms for
males.<P>

<H3>3. Food Collecting</H3>
The mother is collecting sweet habu-habu bark for her baby, one of over
400 types of food orangutans enjoy in the rainforest. Galdikas has
tried many herself. One way she has learned to spot orangutans in the
dense foliage is by the sound of dropping fruit peels and pits.<P>

<H3>4. The baby is reaching for the food. </H3>
Through the repeated transfer of food between mother and baby, young
orangutans learn to process food. They watch and imitate. They learn
by trial and error.<P>

<H3>5. Babies</H3>
Baby orangutans cling to their mother's fur until they are 4 years old.
They are very dependent and remain with the mother for nine years.
Females have perhaps 4 offspring in a lifetime. Orangutan males live
solitary lives, appearing briefly to mate. The orangutan's natural
life-span is unknown, but in zoos they have lived for up to 60 years.<P>


<HR NOSHADE>
<FONT SIZE="+2"><I><TD><B>Activity</I></B></FONT>
<HR NOSHADE>

Try being a physical anthropologist and make an activity budget for an
animal you can observe.<P>

You'll Need:<P>
<UL>
<LI> A focal animal. It could be a pet, a human being or a squirrel in the park.
<LI> A notebook, a pencil and a watch.<P>
</UL>
What to do:<P>

Observe your focal animal for at least one hour noting the time and
duration of every activity. Note what he/she does, how he/she holds
things, posture, utterances, everything. Make two columns: one for the
exact time and one for the activity. For instance<P>
<DL>
<DT>
<DD>     11:02        Left hand picks up cup
<DD>     11:02:05     Sips about 5 millilitres
</DL>
<IMG SRC="galdikas_piegraph.gif" ALIGN=LEFT hspace=10>
<BR>
<BR>
Afterwards, break down the activities into categories like Eating,
Moving, or Resting, and add up how much time the subject spent on
each. Categories can be divided further. For eating, show time spent
on each type of food. Finally draw a graph.<P>

rules in the university research environment. For instance,
for politically correct reasons, certain research is now
frowned upon as it might offend certain groups (like fat
people or women). Also I do not like the emphasis on
collaborative research. Both these trends kill the creative
freedom of the individual. You just have to go ahead and
find things out for yourself. This is the mark of a good
scientist."<P>

<FONT SIZE="+2"><I><B>The Story</B></I></FONT>
<HR>

The room is dimly lit, quiet and small. It's in the big
modern psychology building at the University of Western
Ontario. A young university student sits at a table ready
for the test. There are no windows. The ventilation system
is the only sound. A slightly older graduate student
administers the test from the other side of the table. She places a
sheet of paper with rows and rows of little pictures in
front of the subject and starts a stopwatch. The fellow
taking the test is getting $10 dollars to sit for a half
hour checking off pictures that match. As soon as he
finishes one page, she puts another one in front of him
until two minutes are up. It's kind of fun at first but it
gets a little bit boring after a while; especially for the
older student who has given this test almost a hundred times
already. The stopwatch sets the pace of the action in two
minute intervals as different subjects come into the room to
do the test. Later, the graduate student tabulates the
results to see how many rows of pictures men matched
correctly compared to how many rows the women got right.
Doreen Kimura comes in and takes a look at the raw data.
Right away she can see they are onto something and a subtle
smile crosses her face.<P>


<B>History</B>:<BR>
Kimura grew up and went to school in a small town in
Saskatchewan (Neudorf, near Yorkton), where facilities to do
science were almost non-existent; so her interests were in
writing, languages, and algebra. Before finishing High
School, at the age of 17 Kimura dropped out to teach in one-
roomed rural schoolhouses in Saskatchewan and Northern
Manitoba. While in Manitoba she saw an ad in a teacher's
magazine for an admission scholarship to McGill, applied for
the fun of it, and got it!<P>

At McGill she became interested in <A HREF="http://www.valdosta.peachnet.edu/~whuitt/psyc.html">Psychology</A> as a result of
hearing <A HREF=http://fas.sfu.ca/css/gcs/scientists/more-scientists.html#Hebb>Donald O. Hebb</A>
lecture in the introductory course. She got a BA, MA and PhD
at McGill, the latter in Psycho-biology, and then spent two
years as a post-doctoral Fellow at the Montreal Neurological
Institute, before sojourns at UCLA Medical Center and the
Zurich Kantonsspital in Switzerland. She became a professor
in Psychology  at UWO in 1967. She also has a small
consulting business which sells neuropsychological tests
that she developed.<P>


<HR>
<FONT SIZE="+2"><I><B>The Science</B></I></FONT>
<HR>
Behavioural psychologists study how brains work to
understand how people differ from each other. They do this
by giving people psychological tests. For instance you might
be shown a series of pictures where you have to match the
ones that are the same. The test is timed and the faster you
do it the higher your score.<P>

<IMG SRC=http://fas.sfu.ca/I/css/gcs/graphics/kimura_graphic.gif>
<P>
1. Mental Rotation Test: On average, men can pick out
matching rotated objects faster than women. Women are better
at matching objects based on their surroundings.<P>

2. Aphasias: Aphasias, or speech disorders, occur most often
in women when they have brain damage in the front of the
brain. In men, these disorders occur when the damage is in
the back of the brain.<P>

3. Finger Ridge Counts: Kimura counts the number of finger
ridges between two specific points on a person's fingerprint. People
with high ridge counts on the left hand are better at
"feminine" tasks. On average any sample group of people will have
more ridges on their right hands. But Kimura has found that
on average, sample groups of women and groups of homosexual men have
a higher incidence of individuals with more ridges on
their left hands. <P>


<B>Activity</B>:<BR>

Find someone you can watch for five minutes while they are
talking. They don't need to be talking to you. They could be
in a restaurant or a bus or they could be talking to someone
else with you. They should have nothing in their hands. The
idea is to record their hand movements while they talk for
five minutes.<BR>

<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC=http://fas.sfu.ca/I/css/gcs/graphics/kimura_table.gif hspace=10><BR>
Make a table to record your data. The table
has three columns: one for right and one for left hands, and
one for both hands. It also has two rows so you can record
self-touching movements as well as free movements.<BR CLEAR=ALL><P>

After doing several different people, count up the totals of hand
movements for each individual. Did you record more right hand movements
or left hand movements? While people are talking they use speech centres
on the left side of the brain. Which side of the brain controls the movements
of the right hand? Your experiment might help answer this question. If you
pool your observations with dozens of others at your school you may have 
enough data
to calculate a left and right hand movement average for men and an
average for women. Which sex uses their right hand the most while they are
talking?<P>

<B>Mystery</B>:<BR>
Kimura offered no mystery for future generations to solve,
saying that it's the unpredictability of science that makes
it interesting.<P>

<FONT SIZE="+2"><I><B>The Story</B></I></FONT>
<HR>

The aroma of antiseptic and crisp sheets mingles with the 
sooty smell of a small coal-burning fireplace at the end of the infirmary room.
"Coxeter, how do you imagine time-travel would work?" says John Petrie.<P>

"You mean as in H.G. Wells?" says Coxeter. The two 14-year-old boys are in
side-by-side beds recovering from the flu in their private school's sick-room.
H.G. Wells's classic science fiction story
<A  HREF="gopher://gopher.vt.edu:10010/02/158/1"><I>The Time Machine
</I></A> is a popular topic of conversation. Both boys are very bright and
believe time travel will eventually be possible. "I suppose one might find
it necessary to pass into the fourth dimension," says Coxeter. <P> 

That is the moment when Coxeter began forming ideas of hyperdimensional
geometries. The boys had some books and games by their beds. They started
playing around with ideas of higher dimensional space. Eventually these
early musings lead Coxeter to his discoveries and books about regular
polytopes--geometric shapes that extend into the fourth dimension and
beyond.
<P>

<B>History: </B> Discovered new regular polyhedron having six hexagonal faces
at each vertex, 1926; enumerated the n-dimensional kaleidoscopes, 1933; Coxeter
groups; inversive distance between two disjoint circles (or spheres).
Author of 6 books on geometry including "Introduction to Geometry" (1961),
"Projective Geometry" (1964), "Twelve Geometric Essays" (1968), "Regular
Complex Polytopes" 1974. Co-author and editor of numerous other books
including "M.C. Escher: Art and Science" (1986). "Kaleidoscopes" (1995) is
a collection of 26 of his papers on polytopes, etc.<P>


<B>The Young Scientist: </B> 
Because of a school essay Coxeter wrote at the age of about 14 on the 
idea of projecting geometric shapes into higher dimensions, Coxeter's
father, who was a pacifist and friend of <A HREF="http://www.physics.wisc.edu/~shalizi/Russell/">Bertrand Russell</A>, took him to see
the brilliant philosopher. Russell helped the Coxeters find an excellent 
math tutor and Coxeter was formally
trained and fast-tracked for Cambridge University.

Coxeter's major contribution was in the area of <I><B>Dimensional Analogy</B></I>. 
</CENTER>
<P>

<B>Regular Polytope:</B> Coxeter is famous for his work on Regular Polytopes. 
The process of stretching geometrical shapes into higher dimensions is 
called "Dimensional Analogy". These shapes are called "Polytopes". 
When they involve coordinates made of complex numbers they are called 
"Complex Polytopes".
<P>
<B>Hypercube: </B>If you pull a cube into the fourth dimension you get a
hypercube. Eight cubes make a hypercube.
<P>
<B>Cube: </B>A square is flat. If you pull it up into the third
dimension you have a cube. Six squares make a cube.
<P>
<B>Line: </B>A line is a one dimensional shape. If you pull it in the
second dimension you have a square. Four lines make a
square.


<P>
<P>

 <B>Experiment:
</B>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="http://fas.sfu.ca/I/css/gcs/graphics/coxeter_tiles.gif" hspace=10> 
Try making some rhombus tiles. A rhombus is a squashed square. Make
two diamond shaped rhombuses, each having four equal sides. One rhombus has
two angles of 36 degrees and two of 144 degrees. The other one has two
angles of 72 degrees and two angles of 108 degrees.
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<BR>

<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="http://fas.sfu.ca/I/css/gcs/graphics/coxeter_ideas.gif" hspace=10> 

<BR>
<BR>
Measure, draw and cut several dozen of these out of heavy card stock and
move them around on a table to make patterns and shapes. Roger Penrose has 
shown that these shapes can be used to make an aperiodic tiling of the plane. 
Try it. Try to make 3d shapes from these 2d rhomboids. How many can you make?
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

Consider 36 x 2 = 72. 36 x 3 = 108. 36 x 4 = 144. 1, 2, 3, and 4 multiples
of the same angle make up all the angles in the two shapes!<BR CLEAR=ALL><P>
<BR>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="http://fas.sfu.ca/I/css/gcs/graphics/coxeter_penrose.gif" hspace=10>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If you love this and it gets you thinking and dreaming, you may have a
future in geometry.
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>

<B>Mystery For Future
Generation:
</B> 4-colour map problem. Although a controversial computer proof has
recently been shown, Coxeter believes that a more elegant proof may still
be possible.

<HR NOSHADE>

Standing on a thin ledge of rock, just below Hell's Gate falls on the
Fraser River, William Ricker dips his net into the eddy at his feet.
He brings up a six pound <A HREF="http://www.wild-eyed.org/sockeye.htm">sockeye salmon</A> for tagging. This one is fresh
and strong, not like the tired ones who are having trouble with the
rapids. Again and again the weak ones find their way into his net.
From a pocket, Ricker pulls out two little red and white metal disks
and a 5 cm pin. He wipes his brow and waves to his partner who is
also tagging fish a few meters away. The sun is hot. A steady hot wind
blows up the narrow canyon.<P>

"Of course there was no road down to 'The Gate' in those days," says
Ricker. "Only a steep trail actually, but nothing you
couldn't handle if you were young and skookum."<P>

Ricker was 30. It was the summer of 1938, the first time he had worked
on the big river and he was enjoying himself. 
It was also the first year of the Canadian Salmon Commission's study
of Fraser sockeye. <P>
While his partner held a fish down, Ricker used a pair of pliers 
to attach the bright tag through the fish's
body just below the dorsal fin. Then he threw the wild sockeye
back into the water to fight its way upriver. The
roar of the rapids, the cool water swirling around his feet
and the hot wind made a perfect combination for Ricker. 
The team of four men managed to catch and tag up to
20 fish per hour, several thousand in all. Enough to
accomplish the goals of the study: "We wanted to find what
fraction of the fish went to each of a dozen or so spawning regions
to mate and lay eggs at different seasons. Observers 
in those regions were on the 
lookout for the salmon and were making estimates of the numbers 
on each spawning ground," says Ricker.<P>

Knowing the number of spawners is crucial if you want to
predict how many fish will be available for future harvest. 
Ricker knows salmon runs like some people know World Series 
baseball statistics. 
He has kept track of the Commission's estimates of the Fraser
River sockeye ever since that day in 1938. Each year different 
numbers of salmon return to spawn depending on the
species. Also, they go through cycles. For example, the big 
salmon run of 1993 is the same "line" or "cycle" as the 
record run of 1913 which was around 100 million fish. For
sockeye, such huge numbers occur only every 4 years. So the
next big run should be 1997. Off years are one tenth as
numerous or less.<P>

Ricker was the first to suggest several possible reasons
for the cyclic variation in returning salmon stocks. Biologists
are still collecting evidence to determine the correct
explanation. The Fraser sockeye are on a 4-year cycle
possibly because most of the fish mature at 4 years of age.
Farther north age 5 is also common. Pink salmon have a 2-year
life cycle. For cohos it's usually 3 years, while chinook or
"spring" salmon return at any age from 2 to 7 years. The most
powerful and largest of all salmon, a chinook holds the world
record, weighing in at over 57kg.<P>


<B>History</B>:<BR>
When he was eleven years old William Ricker began studying his dad's
star charts. Eventually he could name all the constellations and the
brightest stars.  All through high school Springtime found Ricker up
most mornings at 5:00 am. For three hours before breakfast he would
ride his bike into the woods or along the shoreline near North Bay,
Ontario looking for birds. Then he...<P>

1. The Ricker Curve, developed in the 50s, is still used all over the world
to determine average maximum catches for regional fisheries. Each coloured curve
represents a different type of fish population.<P>

2. Line of natural replacement. Along this line, spawners are replaced by an
equal number of adult progeny<P>

3. Salmon are interesting because their Ricker curve looks more like this.
At this point you have reduced the population to 40%, but some fish,
like salmon, produce many more mature progeny when spawning grounds are
less crowded.<P>

4. Natural Equilibrium. At this point, spawners equal progeny. You can't
catch any fish, if you want to maintain the population at this level.
Fish don't naturally go much beyond this level because they get too crowded.
Spawning beds get messed up and many eggs die.<P>

5. When you catch fish, say 20%, you move back here on the green Ricker
curve. You have less progeny, but enough to sustain a catch of
20%--a surplus.<P>

6. The  point of maximum sustainable catch is
actually a bit to the left of the maximum point on the curve. This is
because the distance between the curve and the replacement
line is the greatest at this point. Anywhere to the left of this
line you are overfishing and will reduce the next generation's harvest.<P>

<h1>
<A NAME="Heading1">Great Canadian Scientists Backgrounder</A></h1>

<b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b>
<h2>
<A NAME="Heading2">Introduction</A></h2>


<b></b>The Great Canadian Scientists project was started to
increase Canadian's awareness of the great scientists that our country
produces. Over the last five years with the help of several grants the project
has developed a website, book and CD-ROM to meet this goal.<p>

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading3">The idea</A></h2>

<b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b>Barry Shell is a science writer at SFU responsible for publishing
a newsletter that profiles the work of SFU scientists. One day in the hallway
an Engineering professor named Jamal Deen suggested that Shell might apply the
same techniques he was using in the newsletter to a book on the <i>greatest</i>
Canadian scientists. Figuring therealready  must be many books like this, Shell
went to the public library expecting to bring home an armload. Imagine his
surprise when the science librarian at the main branch of the Vancouver public
library told him that no such book existed. The librarian said there was a
strong need for such a book, especially for school-aged kids who were
constantly coming into the library with assignments to write about Canadian
scientists. Thus the project began.
<h2>
<A NAME="Heading4">Three Definitions</A></h2>

<b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b>Everyone asks, "What do you mean by Great? How do you define
Canadian? And what about the word Scientist?" It's difficult to compare the sum
of great people's lives. Any listing like the one in the GCS project is bound
to generate debate. When Isaac Asimov wrote his Biographical Encyclopedia of
Science and Technology in the 60s he did not even let an assistant type it. In
this way he felt the responsibility for the scientists chosen for that
compendium rested with him alone. In a similar way, Shell takes full
responsibility for the choices in the list of scientists for the GCS project.
There is no committee, just him.<p>
How can you define greatness? Shell starts with Nobel laureates, but also looks
for Canadian winners of the King Faisal prize, the Albert Einstein Award of the
World Cultural Council, the Wolfe prize from Israel, the Welch foundation in
Texas and of course Canada's own Killam, Gairdner, Manning, Herzberg and
Steacie prize winners. As much as possible, he tries to check with peers as to
whether a particular scientist's work was considered to be the best in their
field. He also attempts to select scientists from all parts of Canada, and a
wide variety of disciplines.<p>
There have been many inconsistencies and Shell welcomes ideas for improving the
project. From time to time he receives mail from people who suggest, for
example, that Roberta Bondar (first Canadian woman in space) or David Suzuki
(popular environmentalist) should not really be included. Shell's response:
"Maybe so if you just look at their scientific achievements, but I figure if
you can make it into orbit, or get your science messages on national TV every
week, that's definitely great."<p>
He defines Canadian scientists as researchers who held Canadian citizenship
when they made their most outstanding scientific discoveries. That's it. That
means many of the people in the project were not born in Canada, and some were
born here but do not live in Canada any more.<p>
Scientist is hard to define. At first the project began with researchers in
Physics, Chemistry and Biology and most of the people in the project do work in
these three core disciplines. But the boundaries have blurred a bit and a few
doctors, engineers, computer scientists, and psychologists have joined the
list. There is no good reason for this. It just seems like a good idea and it
makes the project more interesting.
<h2>
<A NAME="Heading5">Women Scientists</A></h2>

<b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b>No product evolves in isolation. A purely "objective" commitment
to scientific achievement ignores other equally important factors that go
beyond science and that indirectly affect the process of science and who does
that science. Historically and currently, women face barriers to entering a
scientific career. It became a project goal to encourage girls and young women
to enter science by including many women scientists whose achievements are
worthy of acknowledgement and can serve as inspiration to women interested in
becoming scientists. Hence the percentage of women in the project is about 20%
while in reality the percentage of practicing woman scientists in Canada is
somewhere around 5%.
<h2>
<A NAME="Heading6">Born, Bred, Matured and First Published on the
Internet</A></h2>

<b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b>The content of Great Canadian Scientists began in June 1991 with
a posting in several Internet discussion groups (Usenet) that called for
nominations. A list of about 70 scientists was quickly generated. As the months
and years went by, the list was refined and rebroadcast to the newsgroups and
more nominations were solicited. Several responders helped verify some
nominees' citizenship or career achievements. Email was used to contact many
scientists, too. Once, upon receiving an email query from me about a nominee
and colleague, a researcher at AT&amp;T Bell labs simply walked down the hall
to ask Brian Kernighan (one of the creators of the C programming language) if
he was a Canadian citizen. The answer came back in just a few minutes. He is.
<p>
With poor prospects for conventional book publication, early drafts of the
information were first published on the World Wide Web beginning in May 1995.
Many thousands of "visitors" later that original manuscript has been much
improved and the book, a website and a CD-ROM are the results.
<h2>
<A NAME="Heading7">Publication of three formats</A></h2>

<b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b>Great Canadian Scientists is the first product available to
Canadians that integrates and utilizes new and traditional media for learning
about Canadian men and women of science. The product synergistically combines
the book with a website and a companion CD-ROM. Each medium delivers the
material in a different way and each has strengths that the others do not. They
work together, not against each other. With the CD-ROM students can hear and
see the scientists talk about themselves and their work in their own words.
Scientific principles can be hammered home through fun-to-play interactive
computer games. With the website, they can send email directly to living
scientists and ask questions. They can play the quiz and try to beat other kids
all across the country (and the rest of the world) playing at the same time.
The book lets them go home and read more about the scientists on the living
room couch or do activities at the kitchen table.
<h2>
<A NAME="Heading8">100% Canadian Focus and Content!</A></h2>

<b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b>GCS has a pure and single-minded Canadian slant. Other available
products, though perhaps made in Canada, often try to target the more lucrative
American market so they must be watered down or altered to fit American school
curricula.<p>
Great Canadian Scientists fits the mandate of the Information Highway Advisory
council to protect Canadians from the potential for a loss of Canadian identity
due to the American slant of the Internet. It also fits with a new Pan-Canadian
Instructional Resource Profile that emphasizes curriculum content about the
process of science. Canadians need to tell the world that we are particularly
great at science. Canada has a great reputation in the world of science. Great
Canadian Scientists shows you why.
<h2>
<A NAME="Heading9">The People</A></h2>

<b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i></i>Barry Shell   Director and Project Manager<br></b>Besides two books on
HyperCard for the Macintosh, the founder Barry Shell writes regular science
newsletters for the Centre for Systems Science at Simon Fraser University, and
articles for popular magazines.<p>
<b>Marvin Entz  Editorial and Research Assistant<br></b>Marvin brings his
editorial skills and research experience to the project. The extensive
reference section profiling 150 scientists (included in the website and the
CD-ROM) has largely been researched and compiled by him.<p>
<b>Jeff Steinbock       Game Design and Implementation<br></b>Barry found
local whiz
kids Jeff and Ian (see below) while they were still students at Churchill High
School in Vancouver. Now a student at UBC, Jeff has brilliantly implemented the
game designs showcased on the CD-ROM.<p>
<b>Gordon Ross  Online version with World Wide Web<br></b>Barry met Gordon as a
result of Gordon's reading an article by Barry about online relationships. As
it turned out, they were both at SFU, where Gordon is a student. He is the
expert on Internet and World Wide Web programming.<p>
<b>Ian Wojtowicz        Online version with World Wide Web<br></b>The other
whiz kid,
Ian has received considerable recognition as the youthful online editor and
publisher of <i>International Teletimes</i>, which he began as a 16-year-old
high school student. Ian is currently a student at SFU.<p>
<b>David Clifford       Graphic Design and Layout<br></b>David Clifford has won
international awards for his designs including the design of the logo and
corporate image of the Vancouver Art Gallery. Other designs include all the
signage at Whister Village and the corporate look and feel of many Vancouver
businesses.<p>
<b>Laura Wallace        Art and illustration<br></b>Working with David
Clifford, Laura
is responsible for all the hand-drawn images that soften the hard science in
the book, website, and CD-ROM.<p>
<b>Kyle Kirkwood        Pedagogical consulting <br></b>Kyle is the
president of the
BC Science Teacher's Association and is the editor of their online newsletter
<i>Catalyst</i>.<p>
<b>David Ritter Music and Sounds<br></b>Through his company Showboat
Productions, Dave does custom music composition and performance and is
particularly well know for his work helping paraplegics and quadraplegics
express themselves with music at the GF Strong rehab centre in Vancouver.
<h2>
<A NAME="Heading10">Funding sources</A></h2>

<b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b>The project has been funded by grants from Science Culture
Canada, the BC Ministry of Employment Partners in Science Awareness Program,
the BC Ministry of Education Learning Resources Branch, the Royal Society of
Canada, the Canadian Federation of Biological Societies, the Blair Family
Foundation and SchoolNet. Strategic partners include Science World BC and the
ExCITE lab in Simon Fraser University's Faculty of Education.<p>

<center>The Great Canadian Scientist Quiz</center>
</b></font><P>
<blockquote>

(Burnaby, October 1996)<P>

<B>Quick!</B> Charles Krebs is an expert on: 1. Why bears hibernate,
2. Why male penguins hatch the egg, 3. Why lemmings commit mass
suicide or 4. Why birds migrate to the Arctic?<A
href="#answer"><B>*</B></A><P>

On October 18, to start off Canada's National Science and Technology Week,
hundreds of people puzzled over such questions. About 40 registered to
track their scores on the quiz at the Great Canadian Scientists website
(www.science.ca). The six top scorers got Great Canadian Scientists
t-shirts and CD-ROMs.<P>

The winners were:<BR>
1. Ashleigh Cheung (13, Vancouver, BC), 2. Scott MacIntyre (39, Dartmouth,
Nova Scotia), 3. Roger Leeman (~25, Zurich, Switzerland), 4. Nancy
Broughton (~25, Chicago, Illinois), 5. Micheline Villeneuve (~30, Orleans,
Ontario), and 6. Louis Moreau (27, Quebec, Quebec)<P>

Barry Shell, the project's creator says, "I think it's great that people in
Switzerland and Chicago could play alongside Canadians at home." The GCS
Quiz and website show that the Internet is a very effective medium for the
promotion of Canadian excellence abroad.<P>

Several things about the winners are of interest. They are from sea to
shining sea; Nova Scotia to BC. There was an even 50/50 split of male and
female winners. A Chinese Canadian was the top scorer. Two French Canadians
are in the winners list. Of the two outside Canada, one is a Canadian PhD
student studying in Chicago. The other is a Swiss fellow who just likes
Canada. Interestingly, the age range of the winners shows that the site is
mainly being used by adults; often to assist children with learning, but
usually for their own interest.<P>

The results are particularly striking because they show that the
Internet is becoming more open and accessible. No longer is it solely
the domain of male nerds and hackers. Instead a cross section of
Canadians was represented in the winners circle. They *are* all
certainly predisposed to science and technology, however, with a
science wiz kid in Vancouver, a professional engineer in Nova Scotia,
a Chemistry PhD student in Chicago, and an Industry Canada employee in
Ottawa.<P>

The quiz was programmed by <A HREF="http://fas.sfu.ca/css/gord.html">Gordon Ross</A>, a 4th year Communication student at
Simon Fraser University where the Great Canadian Scientists website makes
its home.<P>

By the way, anyone in the world can play the quiz at anytime by going
to <A HREF="http://www.science.ca">www.science.ca</A>. Find out once
and for all if lemmings really do throw themselves off cliffs.<P>

<A NAME="answer">
*ANSWER: Charles Krebs is one of the world's leading Ecologists. He wrote the
 most widely used textbook, "Ecology", and he is an expert on why lemmings
 commit mass suicide.<P>

This short list of great Canadian scientist in depth profiles was developed from the longer
list in the <A HREF="reference.html"><B>Reference Section</B></A> to reflect a
balance of discipline, region and gender. We also tried to keep to "Scientists"
rather than engineers, doctors or inventors--though there are a couple of 
exceptions. In order to get them on video tape we also chose living scientists.

Classification system for congenital heart diseases



<P>



b. March 18th, 1869, St. Andrew's East, Quebec d. September 2nd,



1940



<P>



Pathologist



<P>



Maude Abbott won a scholarship to McGill University, Montreal,



in her senior year of high school. She earned her BA and then



decided to study medicine. McGill at that time did not allow women



to enter its medical program, so Maude attended Bishop's College



and became a doctor in 1894. In 1897, she wrote a successful paper



on heart murmurs, but a male friend had to present it for her



since women were not admitted to the Montreal medical society



where she was to read her paper. In 1898 Maude was appointed curator



of McGill's Medical Museum. Here she began cataloguing specimens



and became interested in pathology, the study of disease. She



focused her studies on heart disease and began work on her book,



<I>The Atlas of Congenital Cardiac Disease</I>, in which she described



her new classification system. In 1923 she became Chief of Pathology



at a woman's medical college in Pennsylvania. In 1926 Maude returned



to McGill in Canada, where she pioneered the use of museum exhibits



as teaching aids. She also wrote a history of nursing which was



later used in nursing schools across the country. In 1936 her



atlas was published and was praised as an important addition to



medical knowledge. She was also made an honorary member of the



all-male Osler Society, named after <A HREF="#osler">Sir William Osler</A>,



a famous pathologist who had encouraged Maude in her studies.



On September 2nd, 1940, she suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and



died shortly after, at the age of 71.

<P>



Albert Aguayo is a neurophysiologist at the Montreal General Hospital.

He received his MD at the University of Cordoba, Argentina, in 1959



He proved that damaged nerve cells in animals can regenerate and



form new connections, which was regarded as impossible before



his revolutionary 1980 experiment on severed nerve fibers in the



rodent brain. Nerve cells do not die immediately when damaged



but may survive even for months. This survival provides opportunity



for healing, under the right conditions, such as the enveloping



presence of Schwann cells (support cells that provide structure



and insulation). Although actual cures of serious injuries have



not yet been achieved, more recent research with the optic nerves



indicates some recovery of function. He has been president of



the Society for Neuroscience, and is head of neurology and neuroscience



at Montreal General Hospital as well as head of a major center



of excellence known for studies of regeneration by neurons in



the brain. Dr. Aguayo is a recipient of the Gairdner Award, and WH Helmerich III

award



for Outstanding Achievement in retina research in 1991.

<P>Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1989 for discovery of catalytic RNA







<P>b. May 8, 1939-Montreal, Quebec







<P>Sterling Professor of Biology, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut







<P>Sid Altman grew up in Montreal but through a twist of fate attended MIT where he

received a B.Sc. in Physics. He then studied molecular biology under Lerman at the

University of Colorado Medical School. Lerman helped arrange for Altman to go to

England to work in the laboratory of S. Brenner and F. Crick. While there, in 1970,

Altman discovered an unusual enzyme involved in the transcription of DNA into

protein. He then moved to Yale University where his continued research showed that

the active part of the enzyme consisted of RNA (RiboNucleic Acid). This was

significant because RNA molecules are much more primitive than protein molecules.

Besides offering a possible explanation for how life might have begun billions of

years before proteins existed, it also hints at a way to beat a very troublesome

primitive life form: the virus for the common cold which is based on RNA. It may be

possible to design catalytic RNA-based vaccines that kill cold viruses by chopping up

the RNA on which they are based. Altman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry,

1989; Rosenstiel Award for Basic Biomedical Research, 1989; National Institutes of

Health Merit Award, 1989; and Yale Science and Engineering Assn. Award, 1990

<P>



14 Nov 1891, Alliston, Ontario-d. 21 Feb 1941



<P>



Medical doctor



<P>



University of Toronto



<P>



Frederick Banting was born the son of a farmer. He became a doctor



and studied diabetes, a fatal disease. He and his colleague <A HREF="#best">Charles

Best</A>



discovered a hormone, called insulin, that helped people suffering



from diabetes live a normal life. Banting studied medicine at



the University of Toronto. He obtained his medical degree in 1916 and



served for the remainder of WW I as a medical officer overseas.



He was awarded the Military Cross for heroism under fire. Banting



later became interested in diabetes mellitus, a disease which



at that time meant a slow but certain death. Its chief biochemical



symptom is the presence of abnormally high glucose levels in the



blood, and the appearance of glucose in the urine. It had already



been proposed that a hormone produced by small patches of cells



called the Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas gland might prevent



diabetes. The research of Banting and his colleague Best resulted



in a way to isolate the hormone, called insulin, and extract it



for the use of those suffering from diabetes. The experiments



were completed in 1922, and in 1923 Banting was awarded the Nobel



Prize. Outraged that his co-worker had not also been awarded the



prize, he gave half his share to Best. The Banting Research Foundation



was established by Canadian Parliament that same year. With the



coming of WW II, Banting was again involved with medical war work



and died in a plane crash over Newfoundland.

<H2><A NAME="bell">Bell, Alexander Graham</A></H2>







<P>



Inventor of the telephone



<P>



b. 1874 Edinburgh, Scotland d. 1922



<P>



Bell was born in Edinburgh, Scotland.



Bell was a Scotsman who lived in the USA. He had a Summer home in Nova



Scotia but was never a Canadian. For a scientist to qualify as



Canadian, the simple rule is: they must have held Canadian citizenship



when they did their most distinguished work. 



We include him here because many people consider him Canadian.



<P>



Throughout his life Bell



was interested in the education of deaf people. Among his most



famous students was Helen Keller. His work with hearing and speech



led to his most famous invention, the telephone, in 1876. Although



the first phone conversation took place in the US, Bell said he



developed the idea in 1875 in Brantford, Ontario. It is certain



that many of his early experiments were conducted there, including



the first long distance telephone call, between Brantford and



Paris, Ontario. He also invented the microphone. The Bell Telephone



Company and other related businesses made Bell a wealthy man,



and he was able to pursue a wide range of scientific interests.



He spent his winters in the US on business, and summers in Cape



Breton Island, Nova Scotia, on scientific research, which ranged



from the genetics of sheep breeding to aviation. His Silver Dart



aircraft was the first to fly in Canada, in 1909, and his hydrofoil



speed boats held the world record for more than 10 years. Bell



died of diabetes in 1922, ironically the same year that <A HREF="#banting">Banting

</A>discovered



insulin. It is doubtful that he ever became a Canadian citizen.

collected posters and badges from NASA and played with crystal



radio sets, hoping to make first contact with alien beings. Later



she took physics and mathematics courses in high school and university,



got a private pilot's license and received university degrees



in zoology and biology. She became a doctor specializing in neurology.



Then she joined the Canadian Space Program and trained in the



USA for three full years to do science in space. In January, 1992,



she became the first Canadian woman in space when she flew on

<P>Boyle's family moved to Quebec, where he grew up in a log cabin and received no

formal education until high school. He went on to earn a Ph.D. in physics from McGill

University in 1950. Three years later, he joined Bell Laboratories. Boyle's major

contributions include the first continuously operating ruby laser, which he invented

with Don Nelson in 1962, and the first patent (with David Thomas) proposing a

semiconductor injection laser. Also in 1962 he became director of Space Science and

Exploratory Studies at Bellcomm, a Bell subsidiary providing technological support

for the Apollo space program. In 1964 he returned to Bell Labs, switching from

research to the development of electronic devices, particularly integrated circuits,

which are now essential building blocks in telecommunications and electronics in

general. In 1969, Boyle and George Smith invented the charge-coupled device (CCD).

CCDs can be used as imaging devices, memories, filters and signal processors. They

have revolutionized astronomy (the Hubble Space Telescope uses CCDs at its prime

focus) and created entirely new industries (e.g., filmless video cameras). For this

invention, Boyle and Smith were joint recipients of the Franklin Institute's Stuart

Ballantine Medal in 1973, and of IEEE's 1974 Morris Liebmann Award. In 1975, Boyle

returned to research as Executive Director of Research (see above) for Bell Labs,

where he was in charge of four laboratories until his retirement in 1979. He and his

family divide their time between residences in a small fishing village near Halifax,

Nova Scotia and Mount Tremblant, Quebec.

His grandfather was a general practitioner who rode a bicycle



to tend to farmers in the outlying villages. Years later, Chang,



while still an undergraduate at McGill, invented the world's first



artificial cell in 1957. His idea was to make tiny, ultrathin



plastic microcapsules that could hold biological agents (such



as enzymes). If he could control the permeability of the plastic



membrane, he could control what passed through the wall of his



artificial cell, and thus mimic many of the functions of real



cells. After earning his Ph.D. in physiology, Chang developed the



first artificial blood and a new cellular-based approach to an



artificial kidney, liver and pancreas. While various drawbacks



persist, Chang's inventions have proved useful as temporary measures



and in conjunction with other approaches. Chang is a

Professor and cardiovascular and thoracic surgeon, Montreal General



Hospital Research Institute



<P>



Dr. Ray Chiu was born in Tokyo. He received his MD from National



Taiwan University, and his Ph.D. from McGill in 1970, in Experimental



Surgery. He pioneered a new type of experimental surgery that



removes some of a heart patient's back muscle, attaches it to



the ribs, and wraps it around the heart. A specially designed pacemaker contracts



the back muscle in time with the heart's own contractions, thus



helping a weak heart to function. 



Chiu was the first to overcome the physiological obstacles to



using other types of muscles to assist the heart's function. Heart



muscle is the only kind that can contract regularly without tiring;



other muscles require periods of rest. Thus the physiological



and chemical factors of the back muscle have to be modified to



become more like the heart. Collaborating with David Inuzzo, a



biochemist of York University, Chiu subjected the latissimus dorsi



muscle with four to six weeks of constant low frequency electrical



stimulation, after which it came to resemble the heart muscle.



The stimulation alters the expression of certain genes in the



muscle cells. The process was actually discovered by biochemists



in the late 60s, but was not applied to heart surgery until the



research came to the attention of cardiac surgeons in the last



decade. <P>

University of Western Ontario, 1960). Costerton was a University



of Calgary postdoctoral student in 1978 when he shook up the established



science of microbiology with a new view of bacterial life.  He and his team worked

out



a way to see the structure of the slimy substance that seemed



to anchor bacteria to surfaces in cattle stomachs. When they took



the bacteria into the lab and "purified" them, they became just



like ordinary bacteria. It became obvious that test-tube bacteria



are not the same as in life. Natural bacterial colonies were creating



their own microhabitat, adhering to surfaces and covering themselves



with a slimy protective layer of molecules Costerton dubbed "matrix-enclosed



biofilms." The researchers also found that biofilm bacteria



were often team players, different species working in physiological



co-operation.  Biofilms also survive under conditions



that floaters (individual bacteria released as scouts



from the biofilms themselves) can't; it takes up to 50 times the bactericide to



kill an attached slime population as it does to kill floaters.



Costerton and his team have applied their knowledge to developing



new technologies in areas ranging from oil production to bacteria-resistant



medical devices. He holds several biological patents and is president



of the Microbios company. He received the Haultain Prize in 1984



and the Isaac Walton Killam Memorial Prize in 1989, and holds

fellow in the laboratories of Nobel laureate R. B. Woodward, during



the effort to synthesize Vitamin B-12. At the University of Sherbrooke, Pierre

Deslongchamps pioneered advances



in the fabrication of complex organic chemicals, a key contribution



to many areas of science, as well as to the search for more effective



drugs. At the age of 26 he synthesized ryanodol, a very complex



molecule. He also synthesized



the twistane molecule and accomplished the total synthesis of



agarofuran, hinesol and occidentalol, all during a four year period.

His discovery of the role of `stereoelectronic effects' in controlling



certain organic reactions has become a fundamental concept of



the discipline, actually changing the way scientists look at molecules.



He has won many awards and recognitions, including a Steacie Fellowship,



the Canada Gold Medal (NSERC) and the Prix Marie-Victorin.

Dr. Jean Dow was a surgeon in China for over thirty years. There,



she did research into the organism which causes Kala-azar, a wasting



disease which is prevalent in Africa, Asia and the Middle East.



Her work paved the way for the development of treatment for this



illness, which previously had a fatality rate of 70%. Jean earned



her medical degree from the University of Toronto in 1895. Later



that year, she traveled to China, where she would spend the rest



of her life. For twenty years, she was the only woman doctor at



the Canadian Presbyterian Mission in Honan. Dr. Dow received a

Geochemistry and global change



<P>



4 June 1927-Ashburn, New Zealand



<P>



Geochemist; professor emeritus, retired



<P>



Department of Geology, University of Western Ontario



<P>



William S. Fyfe is Canada's foremost earth scientist, widely considered



the world's most eminent geochemist. He grew up as the youngest



of three brothers on a farm in South Island, New Zealand, and



was the first student from his one-room school to attend university (B.Sc., Otago

University, New Zealand, 1948; M.Sc. 1949; Ph.D. 1952).



Early in his career, Fyfe's application of chemistry to geological



research earned him a reputation as the "Father of Modern



Geochemistry". He made important contributions to the knowledge



of isomorphism, studying the behaviour of rock forming minerals



under high temperature and stress. His investigation of metamorphism



- the chemical and physical transformation of rocks under pressure



and stress at the base of mountain systems - revolutionized the



field of Metamorphic Petrology. While Dean of Science at University of Western



Ontario  (1986-90), he established the Interface Science Research



Centre. Fyfe's Canadian research effort focused on the role of



fluids and tectonics in creating deposits of precious metals,



particularly gold. He did research on a range of biosphere-geosphere



interactions, including the role of micro-organisms in concentrating



metals and the role of geothermal systems in creating ocean nutrients.



Concerned with the environmental



implications of human energy consumption, Fyfe conducted research



into problems associated with the industrial exploitation of lignitic



coals. His knowledge of the geology of ancient rocks and the movement



of fluids in the Earth's crust were key to research into the possibility



of safe geological disposal of high-level nuclear wastes. As well,



he devoted attention to the genesis and conservation of Earth's



vulnerable fertile soils and the alarming current rate of soil



erosion. He led the establishment of the Global Change program,



a comprehensive international investigation of Earth's life-support



systems. He was awarded the Canada Gold Medal for Science and Engineering, NSERC, in

1991.<P>

CEA enters the blood and thus a blood test or radioimmunoassay

<P>



The University of Alberta chemistry professor is a leader in the



development of miniature analytical systems. Micromachining techniques



are used to fabricate tiny three-dimensional structures that can



carry out chemical analyses on a piece of silicon a couple of



centimetres square. The result is a "lab-on-a-chip."



And the applications are diverse. They include immunological tests



for hormones and drugs of abuse, DNA diagnostics, tests for soil



and water contamination, and detection of biological warfare agents



on the battlefield. The small size of the devices would make test



kits easily portable, a key advantage for military and environmental



applications. As well, chemical analyses can be completed in seconds,



virtually eliminating any anxious waiting for test results. A



lab-on-a-chip also requires only a minute volume of test material



-- about one billionth of a millilitre, a "speck" to



non-scientists. Perhaps most amazing are the detection limits



of these devices. They are capable of detecting picomolar concentrations



-- that's like one Tylenol tablet dissolved in 12 Olympic-sized



swimming pools. "This is the sort of thing people react to



by saying 'wow.' Well, I feel that way too," says Dr. Harrison.



"This field is opening up in front of our eyes. It is very

His studies culminated in 1949 with the publication of  <I>The Organization



of Behaviour</I>, a keystone of modern neuroscience that broke new



ground by positing neural structures, called cell assemblies,



which were formed through the action of feedback loops or what



is now called the Hebb synapse. The cell-assembly theory guided



Hebb's landmark experiments on the influence of early environment



on adult intelligence. It foreshadowed neural network theory,



an active line of research in artificial intelligence.

core, an effect he called photosensitivity. Direct results of



his work are the development of low cost/high performance devices



such as wavelength filters, multiplexers and laser frequency stabilizers,



important to telecommunications. Optical sensors for measuring



temperature and strain are also beneficial outcomes for the construction



industry. Dr. Hill is a 1995 Manning Awards recipient.

Neuroanatomy--Nobel Medicine 1981 for Mapping the Visual Cortex



<P>b. 1926, Montreal, Quebec

<P>Born of American parents, David Hubel grew up in Montreal. His father was a

chemist. He majored in physics at McGill University, and then became interested in

the medical world. So he enrolled in McGill's medical school, without ever having

taken a biology course. Hubel moved to Johns Hopkins in 1958, and teamed up with

Torsten Wiesel from Sweden. The pair began to make key discoveries about the visual

cortex almost immediately. A year later they moved to Harvard Medical School,

continuing their experiments. Throughout the 60s and 70s, Hubel and Wiesel

co-authored a series of ground-breaking papers on the visual cortex. They used

microelectrodes and modern electronics to detect the activity of individual neurons,

using cats as their subjects. (The cats were not harmed by these experiments; indeed,

their purring created vibration problems.) They found that stimulation of cells on

the retina by light causes activity in particular cells in the striate cortex, where

cells are arranged in columns and layers. This cell activation is surprisingly

specific: some cells respond to spots of light, others to lines whose tilt is

critical. Still others respond only to specific movements or to specific colours.

Thanks to the work of Hubel and Wiesel, the visual cortex has become the best known

part of the brain. Hubel and Wiesel shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1981.

University of Cape Town in 1949 and took courses in physics and mathematics, since

none were offered in astronomy. Despite family difficulties, Israel completed his

It was only



by chance that Dr. Kallin, now recognized as one of the top condensed



matter theorists in the world, got into physics. In high school



she dropped physics after Grade 10. It was a community college



course in "physics for poets" that piqued her interest



in the subject and led her to the honours physics program at the



University of British Columbia. Catherine Kallin and her collaborators have been

studying microwave



measurements on high-temperature superconductors, and using the



data to determine the electrical and magnetic properties of these



superconductors and to understand why the materials are superconductors



at all. "Our traditional understanding of superconductors,



which were discovered in 1911, strongly suggests that superconductivity



shouldn't exist above 30 degrees Absolute (-243 degrees Celsius),"



explains Dr. Kallin. But "high-temperature" superconductivity



(above 30 degrees Absolute) was discovered in 1986, and in subsequent



years the temperature escalated to the present record of 160 degrees



Absolute (-113 degrees Celsius). "There's a large body of



evidence that points to electron-electron interactions as the



cause of high-temperature superconductivity. But we're just now



starting to address the question of what this means for the electrical



and magnetic properties of these materials."

Charles ("Charley") Krebs grew up in a small Illinois town near St. Louis, Missouri.

All through his high school years, Krebs worked for a St. Louis fur trading company

harvesting seals in the Bering Sea during his summer vacations. After getting his

bachelors degree from the University of Minnesota (1957), Krebs came to Vancouver,

BC, to study with Dennis Chitty who was (and still is) the world expert on lemmings.

Krebs obtained an MA (59) and a Ph.D. (62) in Zoology from the University of British

Columbia. Then, after a two-year fellowship at Berkeley, he went back home to teach

Zoology at Indiana University. But in 1970 <A

HREF="http://www.bcu.ubc.ca/~kyba/brochure/faculty/krebs.html">Krebs</A> returned to

Vancouver and has been there ever since as a professor of Zoology at UBC.  Krebs has

spent his working life trying to unravel the mystery of lemmings and other small

Northern mammals whose populations crash regularly every four to ten years. The Krebs

Effect, also known as the Fence Effect, is named after Krebs.  He simply fenced in an

area of grassland the size of a soccer field to see what would happen to the

population of voles living inside the fence. (The fence extends down into the soil

several inches to stop tunneling.) Within a year, he found the population of voles

increased about 5 times. Over the years Krebs has systematically eliminated possible

reasons for the Fence Effect. Krebs now believes that the effect is due to social

behaviour among the voles. This includes the natural genetic selection for more

aggressive individuals over time as living conditions become more crowded. The final

crash seems to be caused by an increased tendency for mothers to kill all the babies

in neighbouring nests.

Hugh Le Caine, the electronic music pioneer, died in 1977 after



a lifetime of invention and composing. Le Caine was a physicist



working at the National Research Council, and he pursued his consuming



interest in electronic music and sound generation at home. During



the '40s, he designed a number of instruments including the Sackbut



synthesizer, which is now recognized as the first voltage-controlled



instrument of its kind. Eventually Le Caine was allowed to bring



his private interests to work at the NRC and his full-time involvement



with music produced a legacy of new instruments and compositions,



the most well known of which is "Dripsody," a piece



using only the sound of falling water drops.

Charles Philippe Leblond was born in France, and received his



MD from the University of Paris and D.Sc. from the Sorbonne. He



earned his Ph.D. at McGill University, Canada, in 1942. In 1946, Leblond



with L. F. B&eacute;langer improved the resolution of radioautography.



Photographic emulsion was melted and poured on the tissue section



so as to make a thin coat that hardened as it cooled and acted



as a photographic plate to the radioactive parts of the tissue



section. The method became widely utilized as a tool in cell study



and is now used in the electron microscope. The method can trace



the activity of substances in the body. Leblond's own experiments



challenged much of established cell theory at that time. For example,



he demonstrated that cells are continuously active, and do not



alternate between repose and activity, as was thought. He was



nominated for the Nobel Prize and received many honorary degrees,



awards and recognitions, including the Gairdner Foundation Award



of Merit and the Royal Society of Canada's Flavelle Medal in 1961.

Organic Chemist--First Synthesized Sucrose



<P>b. June 16, 1920,  Lac La Biche, Alberta



<P>University Professor Emeritus



<P>Chemistry Department, University of Alberta



<P>



Raymond Lemieux grew up in the toughest part of Edmonton, Alberta. His father was a

poor carpenter. His sister had a friend who was a graduate student in physics, which

helped point Lemieux towards university. He went to the University of Alberta, and

got his B.Sc. in Honours Chemistry. His teacher of Organic Chemistry was Reuben

Sandin, who inspired Lemieux to pursue this subject. Later he got his Ph.D. from

McGill University in Organic Chemistry. He took his postdoctoral studies with M. L.

Wolfrom at Ohio State University, studying the degradation of streptomycin. Lemieux

first achieved fame for the synthesis of sucrose. His second major contribution was

pioneering work on configurational determination by NMR spectroscopy. He invented the

olefin cleaving reagent with von Rudloff in 1955, as well as many other reagents in

his career. He has also done important work with antibiotics, and started a couple of

research companies, including Chembiomed Ltd. with the University of Alberta. In

1973, he began his famous work on the synthesis of human blood group determinants,

and in 1975 published the first synthesis of the B human system trisaccharide. He

later synthesized the carbohydrate sequences for six different blood group

determinants. These achievements are important to the chemistry of immunology.

Lemieux's current work deals with molecular recognition in biological processes. He

has received numerous awards, including the Albert Einstein World Award in Science in

1992 and the Gairdner Foundation International Award in 1985.

Dr. Li, now a professor at the University of Waterloo (Ph.D. at Cornell University),

is playing



a key role in developing and demonstrating the power of Kolmogorov



complexity. His book (co-authored with Paul Vit&aacute;nyi), <I>An



Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and Its Applications</I>,



was the first comprehensive book in this field. It is used to



teach graduate seminar courses all over the world.



The power of Kolmogorov complexity is that it



allows scientists to quantify the randomness of individual objects



in an objective and absolute manner. This is impossible using



classical probability theory. For example, in computer science



it is often necessary to determine how fast a certain program



runs. Using conventional methods, this is very difficult because



the program must be run with a large number of inputs, each result



analyzed, and an average time arrived at. Using Kolmogorov complexity,



only one input is needed to complete the analysis. In one area



of his current research (which also includes machine learning



and computational biology), Dr. Li is extending the use of Kolmogorov



complexity in the analysis of computer programs, DNA sequence



analysis, physics and computation. Others are following his lead.

not only

important clinically, as it confers multidrug resistance in many cancers, it is also

very important in basic research, as it has been found to protect the brain from

cytotoxic substances. P-Glycoprotein is the first protein discovered in humans that

belongs to a group of membrane transport proteins called the ATP Binding Cassette

(ABC). ABC is very important in maintaining normal cell functions. Mutations in this

group of proteins causes many well known diseases. One example is the cystic fibrosis

transmembrane regulator (CFTR), which is responsible for <A

<P>



Research Director, Pain Clinic, Montreal General Hospital; E.P.



Taylor Chair in Pain Studies at McGill , MGH; Professor of psychology,



McGill University



<P>



After studying for his Ph.D. in 1954 with <A HREF="#hebb">D. O. Hebb</A>



at McGill University, Melzack began to work with patients who



suffered from "phantom limb" pain, i.e. people who feel



pain in an arm or leg that has been removed. He found that pain



often has little survival value, and some pains are entirely out



of proportion to the degree of tissue damage, sometimes continuing



long after injured tissues have healed. While still a postdoctoral



student, Melzack began collecting "pain words" and putting



them into classes that belonged together, like "hot,"



"burning," "scalding," and "searing."



In 1975, this pursuit led to the development of the McGill Pain



Questionnaire, now used in pain clinics and cancer hospices around



the world. Eventually Melzack with his colleague Patrick Wall



developed the gate-control theory of pain at MIT in 1965, which



states that pain is `gated' or modulated by past experience, i.e.



perceiving a specific stimulus as pain is a decision of the nervous



system. Gate-control theory led to the valuable discovery of endorphins



and enkephalins, the body's "natural opiates." Melzack's



recent research at McGill indicates that there are two types of



pain, transmitted by two separate sets of pain-signaling pathways



in the central nervous system. Sudden, short-term pain, such as



the pain of cutting a finger, is transmitted



by a group of pathways that Melzack calls the "lateral"



system, because they pass through the brain stem on one side of



its central core. Prolonged pain, on the other hand, such as chronic back



pain, is transmitted by the "medial" system, whose neurons



pass through the central core of the brain stem. Melzack is the author of <I>The

Challenge



of Pain </I>(with Patrick Wall) 1982, 2nd ed. 1988, and <I>Textbook of Pain</I>

Maude Menten was one of the most versatile, innovative investigators in

Harrison Hot Springs, BC. She received her



BA in 1904 and her MD in 1911 from the University of Toronto. She was a



demonstrator of physiology in MacCallum's laboratory at the University of



Toronto, but she had to leave Canada to pursue a career as a research 



scientist. In those days women were not allowed to do research in Canadian



universities. She became a research fellow at the Rockefeller Institute, and a

research fellow at Western Reserve University. Then she went to



study in Berlin with Leonor



Michaelis, and the <A

This equation gives an expression for the rate of an enzyme reaction



and became fundamental to the interpretation of how an enzyme reacts



on its substrate.  Ultimately, Menten earned a Ph.D. in biochemistry



at the University of Chicago. She later became a professor on the



faculty of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. In



histochemistry, her publication in 1944 of a new technique for the



demonstration of the enzyme alkaline phosphatase ushered in the new



azo-dye method.

major in plant pathology (the study of plant diseases). She graduated



with her BA in 1918, followed by her MA the next year. None of



these achievements were easy; she had to fight for the same access



to the labs which male students had. Margaret's graduate work



was done in Minnesota and Saskatchewan with two wheat rust experts,



Dr. E.C. Stakeman and Dr. W.P. Thompson. She received her Ph.D.



in 1922, the first Canadian woman to receive a doctorate in agricultural



science, and taught at the University of Saskatchewan. In 1925,



Dr. Newton was appointed head of the new Dominion Rust Research



Laboratory at the University of Manitoba. Dr. Newton became the



best-known Canadian expert in stem rust, a fungus which destroys



wheat, and her work helped find ways to fight the disease. Crop



losses, which had once been at least 30 million bushels, fell



to almost nothing. She was the first graduate from an agricultural

in diseases caused by viruses. In medical research, the availability



of synthetic RNA is making possible the development of new drugs



that were previously beyond the reach of science. These drugs



will consist of RNA sequences tailor-made to attach to certain



types of viruses and interfere with their ability to replicate



themselves. In 1980, he also invented the automated gene synthesizer,



or "gene machine," which made it possible to build DNA



sequences in a matter of hours rather than months, and which he



used in the synthesis of RNA. The gene machine was manufactured



by Bio Logicals, Canada's first publicly traded biotechnology



company, for which Ogilvie was a scientific consultant. He is

Andr&eacute; Robert was born on April 28th, 1929 in New York City. He emigrated to

Canada--Grand Mere (Quebec)--in May 1937



and obtained Canadian citizenship in 1967. His university education



was at Laval University (B.Sc., 1952), the University of Toronto



(M.Sc., 1953) and McGill University (Ph.D., 1965).



He started his career as a weather forecaster with the Meteorological



Service of Canada, but in 1959 transferred to research where he



was engaged in the development of atmospheric models for short



and medium-range forecasts. His chief accomplishments were the



development and implementation of efficient numerical techniques



to solve the interacting time-dependent partial differential equations



that govern the evolution of the atmosphere. Robert was the only



scientist in the world between 1963 and 1970 to attempt to produce



meteorological forecasts with a spectral model--and the semi-Lagrangian



scheme, where he combined existing Lagrangian methods with his



semi-implicit scheme.



In contrast to many scientists in this field who aim primarily



at improving accuracy, he always professed to devise efficient



numerical methods, that is to say, to attain a given degree of



precision with the least amount of computation. The methods that



he developed are now used in models of the world's largest weather



prediction and climate research centres.

<P>Michael Smith was born into a working-class family in Blackpool, England. Smith

was offered a scholarship to a local private school called Arnold School. Eventually

he entered the honours chemistry program at Manchester University and got a state

scholarship and completed a Ph.D. In 1956 he heard of a young scientist in Vancouver,

Canada, Gobind Khorana, who had a position available to work on biologically

important molecules with phosphates. Going to Vancouver turned out to be a very good

decision, because in Khorana's lab Smith began learning the chemistry that would lead

to the Nobel Prize in 1993. Smith's idea for which he won the Nobel prize was to slip

a synthetic stretch of nucleotides--called an oligonucleotide--into some DNA on one

side. The synthetic segment is added to normal DNA using standard chemicals for

breaking and reforming DNA chains, but putting an Adenine molecule where there should

be a Guanine to create a mutation. It took Smith and his team many years of work to

actually do it. In the process they had to learn new techniques, design new chemicals

and develop new chemical processes. One of the chemical methods developed by Smith is

now used in every modern automated gene synthesizer machine.

Dr. Terzopoulos, a University of Toronto computer science professor, has made

significant contributions to computer vision and computer graphics and is now also

doing pioneering work in artificial life. He got his university education at McGill

University and MIT (Ph.D. '84, MIT; M.Eng. '80 EE, B.Eng. '78 Hons. EE, McGill). His

virtual fish are computational models that capture the physics of the animal in its

environment, as well as its locomotion, perception, behavior and learning. (View <A

HREF="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~dt">Dr. Terzopoulos's fish </A>on the World Wide

Web.) In the context of computer animation, Dr. Terzopoulos's fish are not just

highly realistic graphical puppets, but are autonomous artificial creatures. They

swim, forage, eat and mate on their own. He says the goal of his visual modeling

research is to bridge the gap between computer vision and computer graphics, which

have hitherto developed independently of one another as major fields of computer

science. "Graphics involves creating images from models, while vision involves

creating models from images," he says. Dr. Terzopoulos has also done important work

on human facial modeling. He has produced what is widely recognized as the most

realistic biomechanical/expressive model of the human face to date. Modeling faces

can play a role in planning reconstructive facial surgery and predicting its results.

It is also a central concern for automated face recognition and video compression for

teleconferencing. He is the recipient of the 1996 Steacie Memorial Fellowship.

Eva Turley studied biology at University of British Columbia, Vancouver. While still

a graduate



student, she became fascinated with the way cells move. She observed



that the medium the cells were in was hyaluronic acid, a substance



that tells cells when to move and when to stop. Her insight was



to relate this observation to the connection between RAS (a gene



that can mutate into cancer) and RHAMM (the receptor that tells



the mutant to grow), something most other biologists thought unlikely.



She proved in 1995 that hyaluronic acid indeed affects the RHAMM



receptor site, and thus must play a key role in cancer cells.

phenomena, development of low noise gravity wave detectors.



<P>



28 Aug 1945-, Winnipeg, Manitoba



<P>



Professor, University of British Columbia; Director, Cosmology,



Canadian Institute for Advanced Research



<P>



Bill Unruh has done important work in cosmology and quantum physics. He received his

university education in Canada and at Princeton (B.Sc. (Hon.), University of

Manitoba, 1967; MA, Princeton University, 1969; Ph.D.,



1971).



According to his <A

HREF="http://physics.ubc.ca/DeptInfo/broch/profs/unruh.html">homepage</A>,



his current research interests include: applying quantum mechanics



to gravity and the role of time; quantum processes in the early



universe, including the onset of inflation, quantum generation



of density fluctuations, and formation of cosmic strings; and



the process of black hole evaporation, discovered by Hawking,



which is still a mystery. "Concern about the measurement



process in quantum field theory has led me, for example, to the



realization that particles are really defined by 'particle detectors';



an accelerated particle detector in the vacuum would detect particles.



... In general, my philosophy is to study techniques rather than



to find solutions with (possibly) unreliable, crude techniques." He is the recipient

of the Rutherford medal, Royal Society of Canada,1982; Herzberg Medal, Canadian

Association of Physics 1983; Steacie



Prize 1984; Steacie Fellowship, NSERC 1984-86, and the BC Science Council



Gold Medal 1990.

Adiabatic calorimetric measurement of heat capacities and measurement

<P>



b. 28 Dec 1953-, London, Ontario



<P>



Professor in chemistry &amp; Physics, Dalhousie University, since 1992



<P>



Dr. Mary Anne White became a physical chemist (B.Sc., University of Western Ontario,

1975 (Alumni Gold Medal); Ph.D., McMaster



University, 1980) and is a professor of chemistry



and physics at Dalhousie University. Over five years she developed



a new class of chemicals which absorb waste heat from industrial



processes, and which can also be used to insulate homes. During



this time, Dr. White received funding from federal government



agencies, such as the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research



Council. Dr. White says her father, "a frustrated inventor",



subtly encouraged her to pursue a career in science; her two older



brothers also have science-related professions.

Invented and developed the Prism Light Guide System.



<P>



Assoc. Professor, Physics Dept., University of British Columbia, Vancouver,



BC



<P>



Dr. Whitehead began working on the light pipe after making a key



discovery in 1978 while he was a University of British Columbia physics student

(B.Sc., M.Sc., Ph.D., UBC (77,79,89)). He showed



theoretically that the `total internal reflection' effect used



in optical fibres could be harnessed in large hollow pipes, if



they could be coated with precision, gem-like prisms. His research



on structured surface physics -- the study of interfaces containing



precision structures on a scale of 0.1 to 100 micrometers -- led



to the prism light guide. His system can make use either of sunlight



or electric light as a source. He occupies UBC's new Chair in



Structured Surface Physics, which was established by the Natural



Sciences and Engineering Research Council (<A HREF="http://www.nserc.ca/">NSERC</A>)



and 3M Canada Inc. There, he and his colleagues in both the university



and BC industry continue physics research generating innovations



in lighting, image display technology, optics, electromagnetic



filters and thin flexible sound sources. Recipient of 1984 Manning



Principal Award and 1995 winner of the BC Science and Engineering



Gold Medal in Industrial Innovation. He was CEO of TIR Systems Ltd. 1983-93.

b. 1919, Prague, Czech.-d. 28 Nov. 1986m, Fredericton, NB



<P>



Professor, U of New Brunswick



<P>



Karel Wiesner was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, and received



his Ph.D. there for research in polarography at Bulovka Hospital.



He came to the University of New Brunswick in 1948 where he developed



Canada's leading school of natural products chemistry. His former



students are found at most of the major chemistry schools in Canada.



He determined the chemical structure of and synthesized very complicated



alkaloids and made major contributions to the fields of terpenoids



and steroids. He received the highest honour of the Chemical Institute



of Canada in 1963. Fellow, Royal Society of Canada, 1957.

<P>



b. 24 Oct 1908, Ottawa, Ont.-d. 1992



<P>



Professor of geophysics, University of Toronto; director general, Ontario



Science Centre



<P>



J. Tuzo Wilson was born in Ottawa, Ontario. Educated at Toronto, Cambridge



and Princeton (BA, Geophysics, University of Toronto (first granted); Cambridge,

1932, 1940;



Princeton, 1936), he worked with the Geological Survey of Canada 1936-39. He became

Professor of geophysics,



University of Toronto, 1946-74. While searching



for unknown arctic islands 1946-47, he became the second Canadian to



fly over the North Pole. 



He was internationally respected for work on glaciers, mountain



building, geology of ocean basins and structure of continents;



his greatest contribution lies in his explanation of plate tectonics.



He also pioneered the use of air photos in geological mapping



and was responsible for the first glacial map of Canada. He served on the National

Research Council, 1958-64. He was



the recipient of numerous awards, and was a Companion of the Order



of Canada. He was also an author for



popular audiences, including two books on China that helped reopen



relations between China and Western countries. He was the first person to



ascend Mt. Hague in Montana, 1935 (Mt. Tuzo in the Rockies bears



his mother's name, also a mountain climber). He served as Director General of the

Ontario



Science Centre, 1974-85.

This short list of great Canadian scientist in depth profiles was developed from the longer
list in the <A HREF="reference.html"><B>Reference Section</B></A> to reflect a
balance of discipline, region and gender. We also tried to keep to "Scientists"
rather than engineers, doctors or inventors--though there are a couple of 
exceptions. In order to get them on video tape we also chose living scientists.

are a hundred and fifty more Canadian scientists, many of whom may be



as great or even greater than the ones profiled in detail.  Only brief

Classification system for congenital heart diseases



<P>



b. March 18th, 1869, St. Andrew's East, Quebec d. September 2nd,



1940



<P>



Pathologist



<P>



Maude Abbott won a scholarship to McGill University, Montreal,



in her senior year of high school. She earned her BA and then



decided to study medicine. McGill at that time did not allow women



to enter its medical program, so Maude attended Bishop's College



and became a doctor in 1894. In 1897, she wrote a successful paper



on heart murmurs, but a male friend had to present it for her



since women were not admitted to the Montreal medical society



where she was to read her paper. In 1898 Maude was appointed curator



of McGill's Medical Museum. Here she began cataloguing specimens



and became interested in pathology, the study of disease. She



focused her studies on heart disease and began work on her book,



<I>The Atlas of Congenital Cardiac Disease</I>, in which she described



her new classification system. In 1923 she became Chief of Pathology



at a woman's medical college in Pennsylvania. In 1926 Maude returned



to McGill in Canada, where she pioneered the use of museum exhibits



as teaching aids. She also wrote a history of nursing which was



later used in nursing schools across the country. In 1936 her



atlas was published and was praised as an important addition to



medical knowledge. She was also made an honorary member of the



all-male Osler Society, named after <A HREF="#osler">Sir William Osler</A>,



a famous pathologist who had encouraged Maude in her studies.



On September 2nd, 1940, she suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and



died shortly after, at the age of 71.

Neurophysiologist; Professor of neurology &amp; physiology, Director



of Centre for Research in Neuroscience, McGill University &amp; Montreal



General Hospital Research Institute; Director, Canadian Network of Centres of

Excellence

<P>



Montreal General Hospital, Neuroscience Unit; McGill University



<P>



Albert Aguayo is a neurophysiologist at the Montreal General Hospital.

He received his MD at the University of Cordoba, Argentina, in 1959



He proved that damaged nerve cells in animals can regenerate and



form new connections, which was regarded as impossible before



his revolutionary 1980 experiment on severed nerve fibers in the



rodent brain. Nerve cells do not die immediately when damaged



but may survive even for months. This survival provides opportunity



for healing, under the right conditions, such as the enveloping



presence of Schwann cells (support cells that provide structure



and insulation). Although actual cures of serious injuries have



not yet been achieved, more recent research with the optic nerves



indicates some recovery of function. He has been president of



the Society for Neuroscience, and is head of neurology and neuroscience



at Montreal General Hospital as well as head of a major center



of excellence known for studies of regeneration by neurons in



the brain. Dr. Aguayo is a recipient of the Gairdner Award, and WH Helmerich III

award



for Outstanding Achievement in retina research in 1991.

</H2>



<P>Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1989 for discovery of catalytic RNA







<P>b. May 8, 1939-Montreal, Quebec







<P>Sterling Professor of Biology, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut







<P>Sid Altman grew up in Montreal but through a twist of fate attended MIT where he

received a B.Sc. in Physics. He then studied molecular biology under Lerman at the

University of Colorado Medical School. Lerman helped arrange for Altman to go to

England to work in the laboratory of S. Brenner and F. Crick. While there, in 1970,

Altman discovered an unusual enzyme involved in the transcription of DNA into

protein. He then moved to Yale University where his continued research showed that

the active part of the enzyme consisted of RNA (RiboNucleic Acid). This was

significant because RNA molecules are much more primitive than protein molecules.

Besides offering a possible explanation for how life might have begun billions of

years before proteins existed, it also hints at a way to beat a very troublesome

primitive life form: the virus for the common cold which is based on RNA. It may be

possible to design catalytic RNA-based vaccines that kill cold viruses by chopping up

the RNA on which they are based. Altman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry,

1989; Rosenstiel Award for Basic Biomedical Research, 1989; National Institutes of

Health Merit Award, 1989; and Yale Science and Engineering Assn. Award, 1990

<P>



Medical doctor



<P>



University of Toronto



<P>



Frederick Banting was born the son of a farmer. He became a doctor



and studied diabetes, a fatal disease. He and his colleague <A HREF="#best">Charles

Best</A>



discovered a hormone, called insulin, that helped people suffering



from diabetes live a normal life. Banting studied medicine at



the University of Toronto. He obtained his medical degree in 1916 and



served for the remainder of WW I as a medical officer overseas.



He was awarded the Military Cross for heroism under fire. Banting



later became interested in diabetes mellitus, a disease which



at that time meant a slow but certain death. Its chief biochemical



symptom is the presence of abnormally high glucose levels in the



blood, and the appearance of glucose in the urine. It had already



been proposed that a hormone produced by small patches of cells



called the Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas gland might prevent



diabetes. The research of Banting and his colleague Best resulted



in a way to isolate the hormone, called insulin, and extract it



for the use of those suffering from diabetes. The experiments



were completed in 1922, and in 1923 Banting was awarded the Nobel



Prize. Outraged that his co-worker had not also been awarded the



prize, he gave half his share to Best. The Banting Research Foundation



was established by Canadian Parliament that same year. With the



coming of WW II, Banting was again involved with medical war work



and died in a plane crash over Newfoundland.

<P>



Inventor of the telephone



<P>



b. 1874 Edinburgh, Scotland d. 1922



<P>



Bell was born in Edinburgh, Scotland.



Bell was a Scotsman who lived in the USA. He had a Summer home in Nova



Scotia but was never a Canadian. For a scientist to qualify as



Canadian, the simple rule is: they must have held Canadian citizenship



when they did their most distinguished work. 



We include him here because many people consider him Canadian.



<P>



Throughout his life Bell



was interested in the education of deaf people. Among his most



famous students was Helen Keller. His work with hearing and speech



led to his most famous invention, the telephone, in 1876. Although



the first phone conversation took place in the US, Bell said he



developed the idea in 1875 in Brantford, Ontario. It is certain



that many of his early experiments were conducted there, including



the first long distance telephone call, between Brantford and



Paris, Ontario. He also invented the microphone. The Bell Telephone



Company and other related businesses made Bell a wealthy man,



and he was able to pursue a wide range of scientific interests.



He spent his winters in the US on business, and summers in Cape



Breton Island, Nova Scotia, on scientific research, which ranged



from the genetics of sheep breeding to aviation. His Silver Dart



aircraft was the first to fly in Canada, in 1909, and his hydrofoil



speed boats held the world record for more than 10 years. Bell



died of diabetes in 1922, ironically the same year that <A HREF="#banting">Banting

</A>discovered



insulin. It is doubtful that he ever became a Canadian citizen.

formal education until high school. He went on to earn a Ph.D. in physics from McGill

University in 1950. Three years later, he joined Bell Laboratories. Boyle's major

contributions include the first continuously operating ruby laser, which he invented

with Don Nelson in 1962, and the first patent (with David Thomas) proposing a

semiconductor injection laser. Also in 1962 he became director of Space Science and

Exploratory Studies at Bellcomm, a Bell subsidiary providing technological support

for the Apollo space program. In 1964 he returned to Bell Labs, switching from

research to the development of electronic devices, particularly integrated circuits,

which are now essential building blocks in telecommunications and electronics in

general. In 1969, Boyle and George Smith invented the charge-coupled device (CCD).

CCDs can be used as imaging devices, memories, filters and signal processors. They

have revolutionized astronomy (the Hubble Space Telescope uses CCDs at its prime

focus) and created entirely new industries (e.g., filmless video cameras). For this

invention, Boyle and Smith were joint recipients of the Franklin Institute's Stuart

Ballantine Medal in 1973, and of IEEE's 1974 Morris Liebmann Award. In 1975, Boyle

Professor and cardiovascular and thoracic surgeon, Montreal General



Hospital Research Institute



<P>



Dr. Ray Chiu was born in Tokyo. He received his MD from National



Taiwan University, and his Ph.D. from McGill in 1970, in Experimental



Surgery. He pioneered a new type of experimental surgery that



removes some of a heart patient's back muscle, attaches it to



the ribs, and wraps it around the heart. A specially designed pacemaker contracts



the back muscle in time with the heart's own contractions, thus



helping a weak heart to function. 



Chiu was the first to overcome the physiological obstacles to



using other types of muscles to assist the heart's function. Heart



muscle is the only kind that can contract regularly without tiring;



other muscles require periods of rest. Thus the physiological



and chemical factors of the back muscle have to be modified to



become more like the heart. Collaborating with David Inuzzo, a



biochemist of York University, Chiu subjected the latissimus dorsi



muscle with four to six weeks of constant low frequency electrical



stimulation, after which it came to resemble the heart muscle.



The stimulation alters the expression of certain genes in the



muscle cells. The process was actually discovered by biochemists



in the late 60s, but was not applied to heart surgery until the



research came to the attention of cardiac surgeons in the last



decade. <P>

William Costerton was born in Vernon, BC. He became an expert



in microbiology and electron microscopy (BA, University of BC, 1955; MA, 1956; Ph.D.,

University of Western Ontario, 1960). Costerton was a University



of Calgary postdoctoral student in 1978 when he shook up the established



science of microbiology with a new view of bacterial life.  He and his team worked

out



a way to see the structure of the slimy substance that seemed



to anchor bacteria to surfaces in cattle stomachs. When they took



the bacteria into the lab and "purified" them, they became just



like ordinary bacteria. It became obvious that test-tube bacteria



are not the same as in life. Natural bacterial colonies were creating



their own microhabitat, adhering to surfaces and covering themselves



with a slimy protective layer of molecules Costerton dubbed "matrix-enclosed



biofilms." The researchers also found that biofilm bacteria



were often team players, different species working in physiological



co-operation.  Biofilms also survive under conditions



that floaters (individual bacteria released as scouts



from the biofilms themselves) can't; it takes up to 50 times the bactericide to



kill an attached slime population as it does to kill floaters.



Costerton and his team have applied their knowledge to developing



new technologies in areas ranging from oil production to bacteria-resistant



medical devices. He holds several biological patents and is president



of the Microbios company. He received the Haultain Prize in 1984



and the Isaac Walton Killam Memorial Prize in 1989, and holds



a NSERC industrial research chair.

Canada, where he received his M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Pathology.



In 1973, he was appointed Assistant Professor of Pathology at



Queen's University where his career as an independent investigator



began. Although Dr. de Bold trained primarily in biochemistry,



he also studied as an experimental pathologist during his graduate



work. He used his combined skills to study the cell biology of



the mammalian atrial cardiocyte (heart muscle cell). He also investigated



the cell biology of the pancreatic beta cells and cells of the



pars intermedia of the pituitary gland. His researches on the



heart led him to the 1980 discovery of Atrial Natriuretic Factor



(ANF): a polypeptide hormone produced by the cardiac muscle cell



of the heart atrium. He thus demonstrated that the heart has an



endocrine function and opened a field of research that has led



to many new insights in biology.  Recognition of his work on ANF is shown by his

<P>



Geochemist; professor emeritus, retired



<P>



Department of Geology, University of Western Ontario



<P>



William S. Fyfe is Canada's foremost earth scientist, widely considered



the world's most eminent geochemist. He grew up as the youngest



of three brothers on a farm in South Island, New Zealand, and



was the first student from his one-room school to attend university (B.Sc., Otago

University, New Zealand, 1948; M.Sc. 1949; Ph.D. 1952).



Early in his career, Fyfe's application of chemistry to geological



research earned him a reputation as the "Father of Modern



Geochemistry". He made important contributions to the knowledge



of isomorphism, studying the behaviour of rock forming minerals



under high temperature and stress. His investigation of metamorphism



- the chemical and physical transformation of rocks under pressure



and stress at the base of mountain systems - revolutionized the



field of Metamorphic Petrology. While Dean of Science at University of Western



Ontario  (1986-90), he established the Interface Science Research



Centre. Fyfe's Canadian research effort focused on the role of



fluids and tectonics in creating deposits of precious metals,



particularly gold. He did research on a range of biosphere-geosphere



interactions, including the role of micro-organisms in concentrating



metals and the role of geothermal systems in creating ocean nutrients.



Concerned with the environmental



implications of human energy consumption, Fyfe conducted research



into problems associated with the industrial exploitation of lignitic



coals. His knowledge of the geology of ancient rocks and the movement



of fluids in the Earth's crust were key to research into the possibility



of safe geological disposal of high-level nuclear wastes. As well,



he devoted attention to the genesis and conservation of Earth's



vulnerable fertile soils and the alarming current rate of soil



erosion. He led the establishment of the Global Change program,



a comprehensive international investigation of Earth's life-support



systems. He was awarded the Canada Gold Medal for Science and Engineering, NSERC, in

1991.<P>

Phil Gold and Samuel Freedman discovered in 1965 a carcinoembryonic



antigen (CEA), produced during growth of cancer cells of the digestive



system. This antigen is produced in tumors and fetal and embryonic



gut, pancreas and liver cells, but not by normal adult cells.



CEA enters the blood and thus a blood test or radioimmunoassay



was developed that can indicate the presence, spread or reoccurence



of cancer. The CEA assay has proved most useful in assessing the



extent of a cancer, its growth rate and response to treatment,



but not reliable in testing for the presence of tumors, since



early tumors do not produce enough CEA to be detected. The discovery



of CEA opened the new field of onco-fetal antigens. Recipient

James Gosling was born in Canada. He discovered computers at the



age of 13, while hanging around the University of Calgary, where he later



received a B.Sc. in Computer Science in 1977. He got his Ph.D. in



Computer Science from Carnegie-Mellon University in 1983. An early



project, begun 1984 after Gosling joined Sun, was a technical



but not commercial success called NEWS (Network Extensible Windowing



System), a PostScript-interpreter-based system of distributing



computer-processing power across a network. Gosling began working



on Java in 1991 as a secret project. The results were released



in 1995, adding a new dimension to Internet capabilities. Java



allows small programs, or applets, to be distributed over a network



and safely used by client software on potentially any platform.



He wrote the first version of Emacs for UNIX, and is now leading



the HotJava browser team. Other accomplishments include: building



satellite data acquisition systems, a multiprocessor version of



UNIX, several compilers, mail systems and window managers.

Working with Dr. Emile Skamene (McGill Centre for the Study of



Host Resistance), Dr. Erwin Schurr, and Dr. Ken Morgan (Epidemiology



and Biostatistics), Philippe Gros cloned the bcg gene in mice



and then identified the equivalent gene in humans, called Nramp.



Mutations in the Nramp gene create vulnerability to several infectious



diseases, including tuberculosis, leprosy, salmonellosis (typhoid



fever) and leishmaniasis. Gros and his team also researched the



mechanism by which this gene controls susceptibility to these



infectious diseases, which apparently modifies the environment



of phagocytic cells, the body's first line of defence against



infectious disease. Gros's other major breakthrough is the cloning



of the mdr (multidrug resistance) gene family, which controls



resistance to drugs used in anticancer chemotherapy. Gros is the



recipient of the first Michael Smith Award of Excellence and an

<P>



The University of Alberta chemistry professor is a leader in the



development of miniature analytical systems. Micromachining techniques



are used to fabricate tiny three-dimensional structures that can



carry out chemical analyses on a piece of silicon a couple of



centimetres square. The result is a "lab-on-a-chip."



And the applications are diverse. They include immunological tests



for hormones and drugs of abuse, DNA diagnostics, tests for soil



and water contamination, and detection of biological warfare agents



on the battlefield. The small size of the devices would make test



kits easily portable, a key advantage for military and environmental



applications. As well, chemical analyses can be completed in seconds,



virtually eliminating any anxious waiting for test results. A



lab-on-a-chip also requires only a minute volume of test material



-- about one billionth of a millilitre, a "speck" to



non-scientists. Perhaps most amazing are the detection limits



of these devices. They are capable of detecting picomolar concentrations



-- that's like one Tylenol tablet dissolved in 12 Olympic-sized



swimming pools. "This is the sort of thing people react to



by saying 'wow.' Well, I feel that way too," says Dr. Harrison.



"This field is opening up in front of our eyes. It is very



exciting to push the limits in miniaturization, speed and detection.



I love it." Recipient 1996 Steacie Memorial Fellowship.

research, working with researchers like Penfield and Lashley.



His studies culminated in 1949 with the publication of  <I>The Organization



of Behaviour</I>, a keystone of modern neuroscience that broke new



ground by positing neural structures, called cell assemblies,



which were formed through the action of feedback loops or what



is now called the Hebb synapse. The cell-assembly theory guided



Hebb's landmark experiments on the influence of early environment



on adult intelligence. It foreshadowed neural network theory,



an active line of research in artificial intelligence.

Neuroanatomy--Nobel Medicine 1981 for Mapping the Visual Cortex



<P>b. 1926, Montreal, Quebec



<P>Dept. of Neurobiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston



<P>Born of American parents, David Hubel grew up in Montreal. His father was a

chemist. He majored in physics at McGill University, and then became interested in

the medical world. So he enrolled in McGill's medical school, without ever having

taken a biology course. Hubel moved to Johns Hopkins in 1958, and teamed up with

Torsten Wiesel from Sweden. The pair began to make key discoveries about the visual

cortex almost immediately. A year later they moved to Harvard Medical School,

continuing their experiments. Throughout the 60s and 70s, Hubel and Wiesel

co-authored a series of ground-breaking papers on the visual cortex. They used

microelectrodes and modern electronics to detect the activity of individual neurons,

using cats as their subjects. (The cats were not harmed by these experiments; indeed,

their purring created vibration problems.) They found that stimulation of cells on

the retina by light causes activity in particular cells in the striate cortex, where

cells are arranged in columns and layers. This cell activation is surprisingly

specific: some cells respond to spots of light, others to lines whose tilt is

critical. Still others respond only to specific movements or to specific colours.

Thanks to the work of Hubel and Wiesel, the visual cortex has become the best known

part of the brain. Hubel and Wiesel shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1981.

school teacher. Soon he spent hours in the public library, reading every astronomy

book available. He tackled difficult mathematics since he wanted to know how anyone

could make assertions about the core temperatures of the sun. He entered the

University of Cape Town in 1949 and took courses in physics and mathematics, since

none were offered in astronomy. Despite family difficulties, Israel completed his

M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics in one year. Israel went to Dublin and joined the Dublin

Institute for Advanced Studies for two years. Then he moved to Edmonton, Alberta, in

It was only



by chance that Dr. Kallin, now recognized as one of the top condensed



matter theorists in the world, got into physics. In high school



she dropped physics after Grade 10. It was a community college



course in "physics for poets" that piqued her interest



in the subject and led her to the honours physics program at the



University of British Columbia. Catherine Kallin and her collaborators have been

studying microwave



measurements on high-temperature superconductors, and using the



data to determine the electrical and magnetic properties of these



superconductors and to understand why the materials are superconductors



at all. "Our traditional understanding of superconductors,



which were discovered in 1911, strongly suggests that superconductivity



shouldn't exist above 30 degrees Absolute (-243 degrees Celsius),"



explains Dr. Kallin. But "high-temperature" superconductivity



(above 30 degrees Absolute) was discovered in 1986, and in subsequent



years the temperature escalated to the present record of 160 degrees



Absolute (-113 degrees Celsius). "There's a large body of



evidence that points to electron-electron interactions as the



cause of high-temperature superconductivity. But we're just now



starting to address the question of what this means for the electrical



and magnetic properties of these materials."

and London. Later, she traveled to Canada, where she earned her



doctorate at the University of British Columbia in 1970. In 1974,



Dr. Kenney-Wallace organized Canada's first ultrafast laser lab,



at the University of Toronto. By 1987, she had achieved time scales



of 6x10 -14 seconds for research on molecular motion and optoelectronics.



Dr. Kenney-Wallace has also taught at the Ecole Polytechnique

seems to have continued! Dr. Kenney-Wallace's achievements have



led to many honors. She was the chair of the Science Council of



Canada and is a Fellow of the Royal Society. In addition, Dr.



Kenney-Wallace has received twelve honorary degrees and, in 1990,



she was appointed president of McMaster University in Hamilton,



Ontario.

<P>Professor of Zoology <BR>



Department of Zoology, University of BC, Vancouver, BC 



<P>



Charles ("Charley") Krebs grew up in a small Illinois town near St. Louis, Missouri.

All through his high school years, Krebs worked for a St. Louis fur trading company

harvesting seals in the Bering Sea during his summer vacations. After getting his

bachelors degree from the University of Minnesota (1957), Krebs came to Vancouver,

BC, to study with Dennis Chitty who was (and still is) the world expert on lemmings.

Krebs obtained an MA (59) and a Ph.D. (62) in Zoology from the University of British

Columbia. Then, after a two-year fellowship at Berkeley, he went back home to teach

Zoology at Indiana University. But in 1970 <A

HREF="http://www.bcu.ubc.ca/~kyba/brochure/faculty/krebs.html">Krebs</A> returned to

Vancouver and has been there ever since as a professor of Zoology at UBC.  Krebs has

spent his working life trying to unravel the mystery of lemmings and other small

Northern mammals whose populations crash regularly every four to ten years. The Krebs

Effect, also known as the Fence Effect, is named after Krebs.  He simply fenced in an

area of grassland the size of a soccer field to see what would happen to the

population of voles living inside the fence. (The fence extends down into the soil

several inches to stop tunneling.) Within a year, he found the population of voles

increased about 5 times. Over the years Krebs has systematically eliminated possible

reasons for the Fence Effect. Krebs now believes that the effect is due to social

behaviour among the voles. This includes the natural genetic selection for more

aggressive individuals over time as living conditions become more crowded. The final

crash seems to be caused by an increased tendency for mothers to kill all the babies

in neighbouring nests.

<P>



Raymond Lemieux grew up in the toughest part of Edmonton, Alberta. His father was a

poor carpenter. His sister had a friend who was a graduate student in physics, which

helped point Lemieux towards university. He went to the University of Alberta, and

got his B.Sc. in Honours Chemistry. His teacher of Organic Chemistry was Reuben

Sandin, who inspired Lemieux to pursue this subject. Later he got his Ph.D. from

McGill University in Organic Chemistry. He took his postdoctoral studies with M. L.

Wolfrom at Ohio State University, studying the degradation of streptomycin. Lemieux

first achieved fame for the synthesis of sucrose. His second major contribution was

pioneering work on configurational determination by NMR spectroscopy. He invented the

olefin cleaving reagent with von Rudloff in 1955, as well as many other reagents in

his career. He has also done important work with antibiotics, and started a couple of

research companies, including Chembiomed Ltd. with the University of Alberta. In

1973, he began his famous work on the synthesis of human blood group determinants,

and in 1975 published the first synthesis of the B human system trisaccharide. He

later synthesized the carbohydrate sequences for six different blood group

determinants. These achievements are important to the chemistry of immunology.

Lemieux's current work deals with molecular recognition in biological processes. He

has received numerous awards, including the Albert Einstein World Award in Science in

1992 and the Gairdner Foundation International Award in 1985.

Dr. Li, now a professor at the University of Waterloo (Ph.D. at Cornell University),

is playing



a key role in developing and demonstrating the power of Kolmogorov



complexity. His book (co-authored with Paul Vit&aacute;nyi), <I>An



Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and Its Applications</I>,



was the first comprehensive book in this field. It is used to



teach graduate seminar courses all over the world.



The power of Kolmogorov complexity is that it



allows scientists to quantify the randomness of individual objects



in an objective and absolute manner. This is impossible using



classical probability theory. For example, in computer science



it is often necessary to determine how fast a certain program



runs. Using conventional methods, this is very difficult because



the program must be run with a large number of inputs, each result



analyzed, and an average time arrived at. Using Kolmogorov complexity,



only one input is needed to complete the analysis. In one area



of his current research (which also includes machine learning



and computational biology), Dr. Li is extending the use of Kolmogorov



complexity in the analysis of computer programs, DNA sequence



analysis, physics and computation. Others are following his lead.

important clinically, as it confers multidrug resistance in many cancers, it is also

very important in basic research, as it has been found to protect the brain from

cytotoxic substances. P-Glycoprotein is the first protein discovered in humans that

belongs to a group of membrane transport proteins called the ATP Binding Cassette

(ABC). ABC is very important in maintaining normal cell functions. Mutations in this

group of proteins causes many well known diseases. One example is the cystic fibrosis

<P>



Research Director, Pain Clinic, Montreal General Hospital; E.P.



Taylor Chair in Pain Studies at McGill , MGH; Professor of psychology,



McGill University



<P>



After studying for his Ph.D. in 1954 with <A HREF="#hebb">D. O. Hebb</A>



at McGill University, Melzack began to work with patients who



suffered from "phantom limb" pain, i.e. people who feel



pain in an arm or leg that has been removed. He found that pain



often has little survival value, and some pains are entirely out



of proportion to the degree of tissue damage, sometimes continuing



long after injured tissues have healed. While still a postdoctoral



student, Melzack began collecting "pain words" and putting



them into classes that belonged together, like "hot,"



"burning," "scalding," and "searing."



In 1975, this pursuit led to the development of the McGill Pain



Questionnaire, now used in pain clinics and cancer hospices around



the world. Eventually Melzack with his colleague Patrick Wall



developed the gate-control theory of pain at MIT in 1965, which



states that pain is `gated' or modulated by past experience, i.e.



perceiving a specific stimulus as pain is a decision of the nervous



system. Gate-control theory led to the valuable discovery of endorphins



and enkephalins, the body's "natural opiates." Melzack's



recent research at McGill indicates that there are two types of



pain, transmitted by two separate sets of pain-signaling pathways



in the central nervous system. Sudden, short-term pain, such as



the pain of cutting a finger, is transmitted



by a group of pathways that Melzack calls the "lateral"



system, because they pass through the brain stem on one side of



its central core. Prolonged pain, on the other hand, such as chronic back



pain, is transmitted by the "medial" system, whose neurons



pass through the central core of the brain stem. Melzack is the author of <I>The

Challenge



of Pain </I>(with Patrick Wall) 1982, 2nd ed. 1988, and <I>Textbook of Pain</I>

Harrison Hot Springs, BC. She received her



BA in 1904 and her MD in 1911 from the University of Toronto. She was a



demonstrator of physiology in MacCallum's laboratory at the University of



Toronto, but she had to leave Canada to pursue a career as a research 



scientist. In those days women were not allowed to do research in Canadian



universities. She became a research fellow at the Rockefeller Institute, and a

research fellow at Western Reserve University. Then she went to



study in Berlin with Leonor



Michaelis, and the <A

equation</A> was developed.



This equation gives an expression for the rate of an enzyme reaction



and became fundamental to the interpretation of how an enzyme reacts



on its substrate.  Ultimately, Menten earned a Ph.D. in biochemistry



at the University of Chicago. She later became a professor on the



faculty of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. In



histochemistry, her publication in 1944 of a new technique for the



demonstration of the enzyme alkaline phosphatase ushered in the new



azo-dye method.

<P>



Plant pathologist whose research helped stamp out wheat stem rust



<P>



b. 1887 North Nation Mills, Quebec d. 1971 Victoria, BC



<P>



Dr. Margaret Newton was born in North Nation Mills, Quebec in



1887. She earned money to attend university by teaching and entered



MacDonald College, McGill's agricultural school. She earned top



marks and won the Governor General's medal. Margaret decided to



major in plant pathology (the study of plant diseases). She graduated



with her BA in 1918, followed by her MA the next year. None of



these achievements were easy; she had to fight for the same access



to the labs which male students had. Margaret's graduate work



was done in Minnesota and Saskatchewan with two wheat rust experts,



Dr. E.C. Stakeman and Dr. W.P. Thompson. She received her Ph.D.



in 1922, the first Canadian woman to receive a doctorate in agricultural



science, and taught at the University of Saskatchewan. In 1925,



Dr. Newton was appointed head of the new Dominion Rust Research



Laboratory at the University of Manitoba. Dr. Newton became the



best-known Canadian expert in stem rust, a fungus which destroys



wheat, and her work helped find ways to fight the disease. Crop



losses, which had once been at least 30 million bushels, fell



to almost nothing. She was the first graduate from an agricultural



college to be awarded the prestigious Flavelle Medal from the



Royal Society of Canada. She was also given the Outstanding Achievement



Award from the University of Minnesota in 1956. In 1969, the University



of Saskatchewan made her an honorary Doctor of Laws. She was forced



to retire in 1945 due to poor health. Dr. Newton died in Victoria,



BC in 1971.

Kelvin Ogilvie was born in Summerville, Nova Scotia. He got his B.Sc. at Acadia

University, 1963 and B.Sc. (Honours), 1964, then his Ph.D. at Northwestern

University,



1968. He is currently



a professor of chemistry at Acadia University and is famous for



synthesizing RNA, important to many areas of medical research.



He worked for 20 years before he achieved this goal at McGill



University in 1987. Synthesizing RNA could lead to breakthroughs



in diseases caused by viruses. In medical research, the availability



of synthetic RNA is making possible the development of new drugs



that were previously beyond the reach of science. These drugs



will consist of RNA sequences tailor-made to attach to certain



types of viruses and interfere with their ability to replicate



themselves. In 1980, he also invented the automated gene synthesizer,



or "gene machine," which made it possible to build DNA



sequences in a matter of hours rather than months, and which he



used in the synthesis of RNA. The gene machine was manufactured



by Bio Logicals, Canada's first publicly traded biotechnology



company, for which Ogilvie was a scientific consultant. He is



the author of 12 patents and a drug called Glanciclovir, which



fights the cytomegalovirus or CMV. He won the Buck-Whitney Medal in 1983, and the

Manning Principal award in 1991.

William Osler was born in Bond Head, and raised in Dundas, Canada. He trained in

medicine at



the University of Toronto and McGill (MD, 1872), where he began his teaching career.

In 1889



he became the first professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University.



He was particularly expert in diagnosis of diseases of the heart,



lungs and blood. His textbook, <I>The Principles and Practice



of Medicine</I>, 1892 and frequently revised, was considered authoritative



for more than 30 years. He helped create the system of postgraduate



training for physicians that is followed today. His description of the inadequacy



of treatment methods for most disorders was a major factor leading



to the creation of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research



in NY City. He moved to England



in 1905, and was created a baronet in 1911. His ashes rest in the Osler

<P>



Andr&eacute; Robert was born on April 28th, 1929 in New York City. He emigrated to

Canada--Grand Mere (Quebec)--in May 1937



and obtained Canadian citizenship in 1967. His university education



was at Laval University (B.Sc., 1952), the University of Toronto



(M.Sc., 1953) and McGill University (Ph.D., 1965).



He started his career as a weather forecaster with the Meteorological



Service of Canada, but in 1959 transferred to research where he



was engaged in the development of atmospheric models for short



and medium-range forecasts. His chief accomplishments were the



development and implementation of efficient numerical techniques



to solve the interacting time-dependent partial differential equations



that govern the evolution of the atmosphere. Robert was the only



scientist in the world between 1963 and 1970 to attempt to produce



meteorological forecasts with a spectral model--and the semi-Lagrangian



scheme, where he combined existing Lagrangian methods with his



semi-implicit scheme.



In contrast to many scientists in this field who aim primarily



at improving accuracy, he always professed to devise efficient



numerical methods, that is to say, to attain a given degree of



precision with the least amount of computation. The methods that



he developed are now used in models of the world's largest weather



prediction and climate research centres.

he entered the honours chemistry program at Manchester University and got a state

scholarship and completed a Ph.D. In 1956 he heard of a young scientist in Vancouver,

Canada, Gobind Khorana, who had a position available to work on biologically

important molecules with phosphates. Going to Vancouver turned out to be a very good

decision, because in Khorana's lab Smith began learning the chemistry that would lead

to the Nobel Prize in 1993. Smith's idea for which he won the Nobel prize was to slip

a synthetic stretch of nucleotides--called an oligonucleotide--into some DNA on one

side. The synthetic segment is added to normal DNA using standard chemicals for

breaking and reforming DNA chains, but putting an Adenine molecule where there should

be a Guanine to create a mutation. It took Smith and his team many years of work to

actually do it. In the process they had to learn new techniques, design new chemicals

and develop new chemical processes. One of the chemical methods developed by Smith is

now used in every modern automated gene synthesizer machine.

Nobel prize chemistry 83 electron transfer reactions



<P>



b. 30 Nov 1915-, Saskatchewan, Can.



<P>



Professor of chemistry, Stanford University



<P>



Henry Taube was born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and did his undergraduate



work there (BS, University Sask., 1935; MS, 1937, LLD, 1973). He went to the US in

1937 and became a respected experimental



physicist (Ph.D., University of California, 1940). His most famous work has been in

electron transfer



reactions, for which he won the Nobel prize in 1983. Current work



continues with this area, and includes reactivity of inorganic



substances, mixed-valence molecules, and systematic study of back-bonding.



He has received numerous awards and honours, in addition to the Nobel prize, such as

the Linus Pauling award in 1981.

<P>



Physicist--Nobel Physics 1990 for verifying the Quark theory



<P>b. November 2, 1929, Medicine Hat, Alberta



<P>Richard E. Taylor was nearly ten years old when World War II began, which he

credits for sparking his interest in physics when the atomic bomb ended the war. He

had already developed an interest in explosives, and had blown off three fingers of

his left hand. Later he entered the University of Alberta, registering in a special

program emphasizing mathematics and physics. He became interested in experimental

physics, and got his Master's degree from the same institution. Then he went to

Stanford, California, and after two years joined the High Energy Physics Laboratory,

working with the new linear accelerator. By the early 60s he was working on the

design of the experimental areas of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC),

helping to build the equipment and taking part in electron scattering experiments.

Along with Jerome Friedman and Henry Kendall of MIT, Taylor won the Nobel Prize in

Physics in 1990 for work the trio had done from 1967 to 1973. They provided the first

experimental evidence that protons and neutrons, once believed indivisible, are made

up of quarks.

Breakthroughs in fields of computer vision, artificial life and



computer graphics



<P>



Computer scientist, University of Toronto



<P>



Dr. Terzopoulos, a University of Toronto computer science professor, has made

significant contributions to computer vision and computer graphics and is now also

doing pioneering work in artificial life. He got his university education at McGill

University and MIT (Ph.D. '84, MIT; M.Eng. '80 EE, B.Eng. '78 Hons. EE, McGill). His

virtual fish are computational models that capture the physics of the animal in its

environment, as well as its locomotion, perception, behavior and learning. (View <A

HREF="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~dt">Dr. Terzopoulos's fish </A>on the World Wide

Web.) In the context of computer animation, Dr. Terzopoulos's fish are not just

highly realistic graphical puppets, but are autonomous artificial creatures. They

swim, forage, eat and mate on their own. He says the goal of his visual modeling

research is to bridge the gap between computer vision and computer graphics, which

have hitherto developed independently of one another as major fields of computer

science. "Graphics involves creating images from models, while vision involves

creating models from images," he says. Dr. Terzopoulos has also done important work

on human facial modeling. He has produced what is widely recognized as the most

realistic biomechanical/expressive model of the human face to date. Modeling faces

can play a role in planning reconstructive facial surgery and predicting its results.

It is also a central concern for automated face recognition and video compression for

teleconferencing. He is the recipient of the 1996 Steacie Memorial Fellowship.

Discoverer of key role that hyaluronic acid plays in cell migration,



and mechanisms that start and stop cancer growth.



<P>



Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology



<P>



Eva Turley studied biology at University of British Columbia, Vancouver. While still

a graduate



student, she became fascinated with the way cells move. She observed



that the medium the cells were in was hyaluronic acid, a substance



that tells cells when to move and when to stop. Her insight was



to relate this observation to the connection between RAS (a gene



that can mutate into cancer) and RHAMM (the receptor that tells



the mutant to grow), something most other biologists thought unlikely.



She proved in 1995 that hyaluronic acid indeed affects the RHAMM



receptor site, and thus must play a key role in cancer cells.



In a laboratory experiment with mice, Turley succeeded in getting



cancer cells to revert to normal.

He studied the natural sciences at Cambridge (BA, Trinity College, Cambridge, 1938;

M.Sc., 1941; Ph.D. 1948), but "yielded more and more to the seductions of

Mathematics." His exploits cracking code during WW II gained him a fellowship at

Trinity College, but he became particularly well known for his papers on Graph

Theory. He then became a professor of mathematics at the University of Toronto,

1948-62. His fellow mathematician <A

<P>



Professor, University of British Columbia; Director, Cosmology,

<P>



Bill Unruh has done important work in cosmology and quantum physics. He received his

university education in Canada and at Princeton (B.Sc. (Hon.), University of

Manitoba, 1967; MA, Princeton University, 1969; Ph.D.,



1971).



According to his <A

HREF="http://physics.ubc.ca/DeptInfo/broch/profs/unruh.html">homepage</A>,



his current research interests include: applying quantum mechanics



to gravity and the role of time; quantum processes in the early



universe, including the onset of inflation, quantum generation



of density fluctuations, and formation of cosmic strings; and



the process of black hole evaporation, discovered by Hawking,



which is still a mystery. "Concern about the measurement



process in quantum field theory has led me, for example, to the



realization that particles are really defined by 'particle detectors';



an accelerated particle detector in the vacuum would detect particles.



... In general, my philosophy is to study techniques rather than



to find solutions with (possibly) unreliable, crude techniques." He is the recipient

of the Rutherford medal, Royal Society of Canada,1982; Herzberg Medal, Canadian

Dr. Whitehead began working on the light pipe after making a key



discovery in 1978 while he was a University of British Columbia physics student

(B.Sc., M.Sc., Ph.D., UBC (77,79,89)). He showed



theoretically that the `total internal reflection' effect used



in optical fibres could be harnessed in large hollow pipes, if



they could be coated with precision, gem-like prisms. His research



on structured surface physics -- the study of interfaces containing



precision structures on a scale of 0.1 to 100 micrometers -- led



to the prism light guide. His system can make use either of sunlight



or electric light as a source. He occupies UBC's new Chair in



Structured Surface Physics, which was established by the Natural



Sciences and Engineering Research Council (<A HREF="http://www.nserc.ca/">NSERC</A>)



and 3M Canada Inc. There, he and his colleagues in both the university



and BC industry continue physics research generating innovations



in lighting, image display technology, optics, electromagnetic



filters and thin flexible sound sources. Recipient of 1984 Manning

<HR NOSHADE>



Altman is worried. He has no job prospects and he has little 

to show for a year of work in Francis Crick's laboratory

in Cambridge, England. Crick was the co-discoverer of DNA, the

molecule that encodes the genetic information that tells

cells how to function and grow. It's an incredible honour for

Altman to be invited to this famous laboratory. The year is 

1970, an unusually warm June day. At the moment, this laboratory

is probably the best place in the world for genetic

research, but Altman has only two weeks left before he must

leave. And he has no idea where he will go or 

what he will do next. 

<P>

Altman is working on mutant cells

with malfunctioning t-RNA (transfer Ribonucleic Acid)--a

substance that is part of the machinery in a cell that decodes

instructions in DNA. For about the thousandth time, Altman

picks up a thin layer of gel on a glass plate. But this one is 

special. Altman was trying a new experiment, something no one had

ever tried before. If he could just isolate a special type of RNA

called precursor-RNA it would explain everything else.

<P>
After putting a few drops of material prepared from

the mutant cells onto the gel, Altman places the plate into

a strong electric field--a standard technique for separating

chemical compounds called electrophoresis. Different compounds

move across the gel at different speeds because of the electric

field. Altman waits several hours, and then lays photographic

film on top of the gel. Tiny amounts of radioactive tracer atoms

in the RNA emit X-rays that will leave characteristic bands on the

film.

<P>
With a friend, Altman takes this latest piece of film into the

darkroom to develop it. Within minutes the two young scientists

both see it. It's just a white splotch on the negative

but it gives Altman one overwhelming thought, "Now I know I can

ultimately get a job." He had taken the first step in 

a long series of experiments that would ultimately lead to the

discovery of catalytic RNA.

<P>

Altman was hired for one more year in Crick's lab, then became a

biology professor at Yale University in USA. His discoveries 

over the next two decades have resulted in a Nobel prize

and could possibly even lead to a cure for the common cold. 

He is still working on aspects of the same molecular biology

system today.



<P>

<B>History</B>

</UL>


Sidney Altman grew up in the NDG suburb of Montreal.

As a boy he loved books. He liked sports and writing, too, but

the library was one of his

favourite places. He read everything: novels, sports books, and

science. His parents could always find the money if he wanted

to buy books. "I read everything I could get my hands on," says 

Altman. He spent a lot of time alone in his room reading.

<P>



When he was 12 years old someone gave him a book called "Explaining

The Atom" by Selig Hecht. The book showed Altman the

power of science to predict things. From then on he was a 

confirmed scientist. 

"I wasn't interested in Biology at the time. I liked nuclear physics,"

says Altman.

<P>

One saturday afternoon while Altman was still in high-school a

friend of his said, "Why don't you come with me to McGill. I'm

going to take the American SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Tests)." 

These tests are a required part of any application to an American

university. Altman always thought he would go to McGill for

University, but on a whim he wrote the SAT tests that afternoon

with his friend. They both applied to MIT (Massachusetts Institute

of Technology) and as it turned out, Altman got in but his friend

did not.

<P>

Altman's family had to scramble to get the money together to 

send him to this great American school, and he wasn't even sure

he wanted to go. There was a big debate in the Altman household. 

But Altman says, "Within three weeks at MIT I knew

I wanted to stay." He was impressed by the high caliber of the

other students and he really enjoyed living away from home.

At MIT he received a BSc. Then he:

<UL>

<LI>Went to the University of Colorado medical school where he got

a PhD in Molecular Biology and met Leonard Lerman.

<LI>Lerman introduced Altman to Francis Crick & S. Brenner in England.

<LI>Altman won a fellowship to work in Crick & Brenner's lab.

<LI>There, he made early discoveries that lead to the principle of Catalytic RNA.

<LI>Came back to USA and became a professor at Yale University.

<P>

Molecular biologists study the thousands of chemical reactions

that go on inside cells to create and sustain life. Altman specializes in the

chemical processes involved in copying information from DNA and

using it to make proteins, the building blocks of cells. Information 

is copied from DNA (Deoxy-riboNucleic Acid) by a molecule called 

RNA (RiboNucleic Acid). DNA and RNA are long twisty chain-like 

molecules. Actually, there are about six different types of RNA

involved in the transcription process. 

<P>

In Crick's lab, around 1970, Altman was investigating part 

of this complex process. He discovered an enzyme called "RNase P"

that chops a little "tail" off the end of an intermediate molecule 

of RNA called "precursor-tRNA". Enzymes are special protein molecules

that make chemical reactions go faster--a process called "catalysis".

They usually do this by holding or

bending a target molecule in a certain way so that one of its

chemical bonds breaks more easily. It took about a decade, but

Altman eventually discovered that the enzyme he was after was not your

average enzyme. Instead of being a protein like

all other enzymes, it was made of two 

parts--one strand of RNA and one protein. Furthermore it was the RNA portion 

that provided the catalysis. 

<P>

This was a significant discovery because RNA molecules are much

more primitive than protein molecules. Besides offering an 

explanation for how life might have begun billions of years ago

before proteins existed, it also hints at a way to beat a very troublesome

primitive life form: the virus for the common cold. It may be

possible to design catalytic RNA-based vaccines that kill cold

viruses by chopping up the RNA on which they are based.

Altman feels that perhaps the biggest mystery to be solved by the next
generation will be the understanding of the human brain.

<FONT SIZE="+2"><I><TD><B>The Story</I></B></FONT>

<HR NOSHADE>

On an ordinary Wednesday morning in October 1994 Bert Brockhouse
gets out of bed at his usual time--about 6:45. He stretches a bit
to loosen the overnight aches of his 76-year-old body when he sees
the little red light blinking on the answering machine on the FAX line.

<P>
Who could have called in the middle of the night, he thinks, as he
goes over to press the play button. He listens to a voice announcing
itself from Stockholm saying, "B. N. Brockhouse and C. G. Shull have
been selected as recipients of the 1994 Nobel prize for physics."
Brockhouse is stunned. For a moment he thinks, "Oh that's interesting,"
but then he realizes, "I AM B. N. Brockhouse," and he calls his wife
Dorrie, to listen the tape again with him.
<P>

The rest of the day is filled with phone calls, telegrams and interviews.
The next year, one of travel, awards, banquets, and lectures. In short 
Brockhouse had come out of retirement. In his annual Christmas 
letter to friends that year, after describing all the
festivities in Stockholm, Brockhouse says, "If anyone cares,
we got a new car in the Summer, a Chrysler Neon."
<P>

Brockhouse's Nobel prize can be traced back to 1951. Fresh out of
the University of Toronto with a PhD in Physics, Brockhouse sat
at his desk in a faded blue-shingled wartime
hut at Chalk River, Ontario, home of Canada's Atomic Energy
Project for the National Research Council.
 
<P>
He gazed out the window at the snow. It was Winter, but he
felt warm inside the hut. He just sat there thinking, mulling
things over in his mind. The other night he had been at
his boss's house, Donald Hurst, head of the Neutron Spectrometer
section. They had been reading a 1944 paper about neutrons--
subatomic particles with no electric charge that, together with
protons made up the nucleus of an atom. The existence of neutrons
had only been verified about 20 years before. Not much was
known about them. Brockhouse didn't quite understand the theories
in the paper, but he felt it had a lot of interesting ideas.
He was supposed to be working on something else, but couldn't 
stop thinking about the concepts in the paper and how he
could do experiments at Chalk River to try out some of the new
theories in the laboratory.
<P>

He fiddled with some math on his notepad for a while and then
went to the coffee room. As he passed the lab that housed
the radioactive nuclear pile, one of the most powerful sources
of neutrons in the world at the time, he wondered how he
could use the tools at hand, or if he'd have to make new tools.
In the coffee room he met Hurst. Brockhouse went up to the 
blackboard and said, "Don there's something I'd like to show
you." He sketched out some equations on the blackboard.
The math described a device they could
build that would use a neutron beam as a kind of flashlight
that could look into the mysteries of crystalline structures
and other solids. Metals, minerals, gems, and rocks.
<P>

Brockhouse went on to solve problems of controlling the source
of the neutron beam; limiting it to neutrons of only one energy;
eliminating background radiation from other experiments in the
lab; and problems with the sensitivity of the detectors.
The resulting Triple-Axis Neutron Spectrometer is now used 
worldwide to investigate crystal structures.
<P>

<P>

<B>History</B><BR>

Bert Brockhouse was born in Lethbridge, Alberta in 1918, but in the 1920s
the family moved to Vancouver. They operated a rooming house
in Vancouver's West End. Bert had a paper route to help supplement
the family income. He liked fishing and went with
his buddies to catch cod and salmon off the pier at English Bay. He
fooled around with radios a lot, hanging out at radio repair shops and
making home-made radios from designs in popular electronics
magazines. After high-school, instead of going to University,
Brockhouse worked as a radio repair man. Then World War II came along
and his radio skills came in handy as an electronics technician in
the Canadian Naval Reserve. 
<P>

Brockhouse went to the University of British
Columbia after the war, majored in Math and Physics, getting
a BSc with honours (1947). He then did his PhD at the University
of Toronto (1950), moving to Chalk River shortly afterwards.
Brockhouse spent his working life as a researcher at Chalk River
perfecting neutron spectroscopes and their applications. 
Regarding his current work, 
he speaks cryptically of "The Grand Atlas", a sort of rulebook
for nature incorporating theories both physical and metaphysical.

<P>

<HR NOSHADE>

Brockhouse is an experimentalist in the Physics of Solids like metals
and crystals. It's called Solid State Physics. As his tool he uses a
Neutron Spectrometer that he developed at Chalk River.
<P>

According to Brockhouse, the virtue of neutrons is you can say a great
deal about a material by using a neutron beam. Imagine shining the beam
of a flashlight on an object. Your concept of that object is based on
the light reflected from it. But when the object gets down to the
atomic level, the light from the flashlight's beam is "too big". The
wavelength (or energy) of ordinary light is about 7000 Angstroms (one
Angstrom is the width of a hydrogen nucleus), while the wavelength of a
neutron beam is around 1 - 4 Angstroms. In other words, your beam of
neutron "light" can penetrate to see details thousands of times
finer.

<P>

1. The original triple axis spectrometer (1959). The bank of 52 rotary
switches in the upper centre of the picture could be preset to go
through an energy scan of up to 26 points. A feature of Brockhouse's
spectrometer was the way you could vary three angles: the direction of
the neutron beam, the position of the specimen, and the angle of the
detector. Add to this the ability to vary the energy of the incoming
neutrons and the sensitivity of the detector and you have a Nobel prize
winning creation. (Photo, courtesy of AECL)

<P>

2. Monochromating Crystal. A special crystal of salt (NaCl) was used to
separate out neutrons of a particular energy. The beam was then aimed
and collimated (straightened out) before being sent on to the target.

<P>

3. Specimen. The position of the target metal or crystal can be varied
on two axes. The beam of neutrons bounces off the target in different 
directions that can tell us something about the atomic structure of the
material if we can detect them.

<P>

4. Detector. Another crystal, similar to the monochromating crystal,
can be tuned to pick up particular energies which are then passed on
to the detector which counts incoming neutrons.

<P>

<FONT SIZE="+2"><I><TD><B>Activity</I></B></FONT>

<HR NOSHADE>

Objective:<P>

<UL>

<LI> To set up a crude spectrometer


</UL>


You'll Need:<P>

<UL>

<LI> A laser light source (preferred), or flashlight/penlight.

<LI> A crystal like quartz or amethyst

<LI> A dark box

<LI> Optional frequency detector to measure shift in light frequency.



</UL>

What to do:<P>

<DL>

<DT>

<DD>     

Inside the box, set up the laser light source and the target 
crystal. By rotating the crystal and measuring the angles
of refraction of the light beam, you can infer things about
the internal crystalline structure of the material.

<P>

If you have a frequency detector, you can measure shifts in
light frequency before and after passing through the target.
Theoretically this represents a change in the energy of the 
light which can tell you other things about the material.

</DL>

<FONT SIZE="+2"><I><TD><B>Mystery</I></B></FONT>

<HR NOSHADE>

Like many physicists, Bert Brockhouse likes to explore metaphysical
ideas as well--the spirit world. He is a religious man. His belief in physics 
theory coexists with his belief in religion. "Science
is an act of faith," he says. Without faith, how can understanding
the existence of a neutron help with the larger moral issues in life?
<P>

Brockhouse's example of a moral problem is "Kantian Doom" -- 
the idea that we are doomed because even though we
know that something is bad for us, we do it anyway because
everyone else is doing it. Examples might be driving cars, using 
computers, or watching television. Brockhouse would like to see
a solution to this social problem.

<HR>
Roger Daley received a bachelors degree in physics, but decided to
become a weatherman. "I wanted to do something practical with my
education, something that would help people in ordinary life," says
Daley. The physics of weather seemed more practical to him than
nuclear physics, for instance. Canada educates weathermen for free, but
afterwards you "pay it back" by going where ever they send you. Roger
was posted to the remote Goose Bay weather station in Labrador
(actually a U.S. airforce base at the time). This was part of his
apprenticeship in the Canadian Weather Service.<P>

Goose Bay, Labrador 1996.
Daley is lonely, spending a lot of time alone in his humble room in the
army barracks. It's cold and there's not much to do. The smell of jet
fuel is all pervasive and the Delta Dagger Interceptors and KC 135
tankers roar overhead at all hours of day and night. They
support and refuel B52 bombers in flight.<P>

Daley decides to try an experiment. Working alone in his room at night,
he makes up little blue cards for all the American airmen to fill out
while flying missions in the area. From these cards Daley works out a
local theory for the behaviour of atmospheric turbulence in the area.
He spends a lot of time pouring over maps spread out on his bed late
at night, entering the data from the cards onto the maps. The pilots
are very interested and cooperative because ultimately knowing the
patterns of upper level turbulence along the Labrador coast will help
them fly better. They start hanging around his room and talking about
the air in which they fly. Daley realizes he loves this research and
decides to go back to university to get a degree in meteorology.<P>

Daley grew up in West <A HREF="http://www.vcn.bc.ca/welcome/">Vancouver</A> and the North shore mountains were his
backyard. He climbed, skied and boated a lot. His best subject in
high-school was history but he was always good in math. He saw math as
a doorway to science, but he never wanted to be a research scientist.
He always wanted to do something that related to "normal" life. In
grade 12 he had no intention of studying science.<P>

<H3>1. Real Earth</H3>

The Earth's weather is a very complex system affected by
ocean currents, temperature, pressure, wind, and many
other things.<P>

<H3>2. Weather Satellite</H3>

Several Canadian weather satellites detect many of the
factors that create weather. They send this information
back to Earth.<P>

<H3>3. Super computer</H3>

A supercomputer in Montreal (Programmed in part by Roger
Daley) records and interprets information from
the satellite and other sources.<P>

<H3>4. Model Earth</H3>

The weather computer constructs a model of the earth
based on very complicated mathematical formulas. This model can be used
to help predict the weather.<P>

<HR>

<B>Activity</B>:
You need:<P>
<UL>
  <LI> a cup of black coffee
  <LI> a little bit of milk or cream
  <LI> a ruler
  <LI> a watch or stopwatch.
</UL>
<P>

Imagine that the whirling coffee represents the motion of air in the
atmosphere. The whitish milk represents a trace gas. By following the
motion of the milk, knowing the size of the cup and using a stopwatch
to measure the passage of time, you can determine the velocity of the
moving coffee. How good are your velocity measurements when the milk
and coffee become well mixed?<P>

The idea is to stir the coffee very very slowly, then drop milk in slowly.
Note how the milk mixes and measure the speed of its rotation. Do
this by using the radius (r) (measure the distance from the center to
where the drop fell) and formula 2*pi*r to get the distance the milk
travels in one rotation. Use the watch to time how long one rotation
takes. The speed of the whirling mixture is the distance/time. This is
how meteorologists work out speed of moving clouds and storms in the
upper atmosphere. They have satellites that can "see" certain
naturally occurring gasses in the atmosphere, like methane from bogs.
They "track" this methane as it moves about in the atmosphere, just
like the milk in the coffee cup and figure out wind speeds in the
exactly the same way you did in the experiment.<P>

<B>Mystery</B>:
Daley hopes future generations will help develop a huge
computer system that will be able to model all the geophysical systems
in the world. Among other things, such a system would allow us to
accurately predict the formation of ozone holes and trends in <A HREF="http://www.covis.nwu.edu/globalWarming/global.html">global

<HR>

<A HREF="http://www.corpserv.nrc.ca/corpserv/sphere/h_7b_e.html">Gerhard Herzberg</A> was feeling a bit overwhelmed bent over the piles of
paper on his big desk. As Director of pure physics at Canada's
National Research Council, he was very busy in the Fall of 1959. Jack
Shoesmith his research technician had come into the sun filled office. He
walked up to the tall windows overlooking the Ottawa River and said,
"I have an interesting spectrum to show you."<P>

Herzberg thought of all the meetings and conferences he had to organize, 
the paper he was writing, presentations he was preparing and the
book he was trying to finish (the third volume of his series
"Molecular Spectra and Molecular Structure"). He didn't have time
for this.<P>

"It's good," said Jack.<P>

Reluctantly, Herzberg got up from his chair and followed the young
technician down a flight of stairs to the lab below. It was a large
high dimly lit room smelling of ammonia, ozone and hot electric
wiring. They walked past the special spectrograph that Shoesmith had
built--a long steel tube about 50cm high and 3m long. Vacuum tubes and
wires snaked around the base of the aparatus, but the pumps and
electricity were turned off. The big room was quiet except for a
murmuring crowd that had gathered in the corner.<P>

Herzberg hurried over to see what they were looking at. A long thin
strip of glass lay on a viewing screen with a seemingly random pattern
of vertical lines blackening its surface--a spectrogram. Recognizing
it at once, Herzberg picked it up for a closer look. Instantly he
shouted, "That's it!" and broke out laughing. "Eighteen years," he
thought. "I've been looking for you for eighteen years."<P>

What Herzberg held that day was the first spectrogram of a simple
chemical called methylene--a molecule having a carbon with a hydrogen
on either side, written CH2. What was special about this? CH2 is a
very unstable compound, a "free radical", very reactive; a fleeting
transition species in many chemical reactions. But its spectrum was
the key to proving many theories of chemical structure. In addition,
by training their spectrographs on the stars scientists could use the
new spectrum to identify CH2 in nebulae and other interstellar
objects.<P>

That particular spectrum Herzberg was looking at in the
Fall of 1959 eventually resulted in a Nobel prize in 1972.<P>

<B>History</B>:<BR>
As a twelve year old in Hamburg, Herzberg and a friend named Alfred
schulz made a home-made telescope. They patiently ground the lenses,
and set them in hand-made mounts in a metal tube. On clear nights they
used to take the streetcar to the city park and set it up to look at
the moon and planets.<P>

Herzberg's mother was a vegetarian, and Herzberg has always been one himself.<P>

1. A spectrogram is created with a machine called a spectrograph. It works
by focusing a beam of light with a lens, then passing it through a prism
to break it into its component parts. The light source is created by burning
or photolysing a compound that you wish to investigate.<P>


2. A spectrogram is a plate made of glass coated with photographic
chemicals. When they are developed the plates have dark vertical lines.
By measuring the spacing and thickness of the lines and groups of lines
you can apply mathematical formulas and determine some of the energy
states of the molecules in the light source.<P>

3. The distance between the larger lines in the spectrum is proportional
to the molecule's "vibrational" energy. The small groups clustered around
the major lines represent the "rotational" energy of the molecule. These
lines and their mathematical relationships are called "Balmer" lines 
after the Swiss high-school teacher who figured them out in 1885.<P>

4. The molecule CH2 or Methylene. Methylene is a "free radical" which
means it has an extra pair of electrons that it tries to share with
another molecule.<P>


<B>Activity</B>:<P>
You need: a revolving chair or stool<P>

Sit in the revolving chair or stool. Now, holding your arms stretched
out at your sides, spin yourself around, or have someone else spin
you. As you spin, quickly bring your arms in. You should notice a
change in your rate of rotation. Is it faster or slower? This change
you feel is caused by the conservation of angular momentum,
a principle of physics that affects the rotational energy in a
molecule when electrons fall from higher orbital levels to lower ones.

Cosmology is the study of stars and other heavenly bodies. How was the

What are black holes? <P>
Israel's recent theoretical discoveries about the interior of black holes.

Left:- Ground Based Composite Visual/Radio View: The giant elliptical
galaxy NGC 4261 is one of the twelve brightest galaxies in the Virgo
cluster, located 45 million light-years away.  Photographed in visible
light (white) the galaxy appears as a fuzzy disk of hundreds of
billions of stars.  A radio image (orange) shows a pair of opposed jets
emanating from the nucleus and spanning a distance of 88,000
light-years.
<P>
Right:- Hubble Space Telescope Image of NGC 4261: A giant disk of cold gas and dust
fuels a possible black hole at the core of the galaxy.  Estimated to be 300
light-years across, the disk provides astronomers with a clear view of the
bright hub, which
presumably harbors the black hole.  The dark, dusty ring of the hub is a
cold outer region which extends inwards to an ultra-hot area
a few hundred million miles from the suspected black hole.  This
area of dense stars feeds matter into the black hole, where gravity compresses and
heats the material.  Hot gas rushes from the vicinity of the black
hole creating the radio jets.  The jets are aligned perpendicular to
the disk, like an axel through a wheel.  This provides strong
circumstantial evidence for the existence of a black hole "central
engine" in NGC 4261.

<P>

1. The Hubble space telescope has now provided fairly convincing
evidence (like the image above) for black holes at the centre of every galaxy.

<P>

2. As an astronaut falls into a black hole he first passes the "Event Horizon".
At this point he can no longer send signals back out of the black hole. However,
he can still receive messages from outside.

<P>

3. The Inner Horizon. 

<P>

4. Nobody knows what happens in the inner regions of a black hole. Ultimately, the
black hole becomes a "singularity"--an infinitely massive point in space

Objective:<P>

<UL>

<LI> To calculate the mass of a typical black hole.

</UL>


You'll Need:<P>

<UL>

<LI> A calculator

<LI> The following information. If gas and stars can be observed orbiting a
black hole at a velocity of v kilometers per second and if the orbiting objects
are at a distance of r light years from the black hole, then the mass of the
black hole in units of solar masses (m) can be calculated with the formula:
<IMG SRC=http://fas.sfu.ca/I/css/gcs/graphics/israel_formula.gif>


</UL>

What to do:<P>

<DL>

<DT>

<DD>     

In a nearby active spiral galaxy (NGC 4258), 21 million light years
away from Earth, there is an object called a "maser" made partly of
water molecules that can be observed orbiting something at the centre
of the galaxy that is probably a black hole. The maser is 0.3 light
years from the black hole (r) and is orbiting it at a speed of 900
Km/sec (v). Calculate the size (i.e.: mass) of the black hole at the centre of this
galaxy. (NOTE: you can look up more about this system in Nature #373,
p. 103, 12 Jan 1996) <P>
In the giant galaxy M87 in the centre of the Virgo cluster
65 million light years from Earth, similar observations and calculations
show a black hole at the centre of M87 with a mass of
two billion suns!!

<HR NOSHADE>

Nobody knows what happens inside a black hole or where things go when they
fall into one. Einstein's theory of relativity explains most things in
the universe, until you get inside a black hole. Israel feels that a quantum
theory of gravity will need to be developed to explain what happens inside
a black hole. Though people have been working towards this goal since Einstein's
time, the quantum theory of gravity has remained elusive.

<HR NOSHADE>

Krebs sits at the back of the sled, tired and happy to be pulled
along by the noisy snowmobile. Its high-pitched whine breaks the 
serenity of the frozen lake in Canada's North. But Krebs loves it,
the crisp quiet cold, the wide open whiteness. Wind and snow spray
his face as they plow through a snow drift. For Krebs it's a 
childhood dream come true. As a kid in Illinois, he read every book 
in the library about exploring the North Pole. He was fascinated
by the mysteries of the North. Did lemmings really commit mass
suicide jumping off cliffs? Now here he was, finding
out for himself.

<P>

Krebs thinks about the morning as the sled swooshes along
over bumps and cracks in the ice. With him are four ecology students
from UBC, two riding in front of him on the sled loaded
with research equipment, and two up front on the snowmobile.
They are returning from a 6 hour session tagging snowshoe hares
on a remote island in Kluane Lake in South West Yukon Territory.
It's early May, 1980. Working in teams, they had just finished 
checking traps on a grid covering the island. These traps don't
hurt the rabbits. Every rabbit was weighed, sexed, and
if they didn't already have one, they got an ID tag in their ears.
The researchers kept meticulous notes on clipboards.

<P>

Krebs is satisfied. He's thinking about how this new data fits into a
paper he's working on when suddenly the student driving the snowmobile
yells, "Hold on guys," and revs the engine to jump across a crack
in the ice. The lake is starting to break up with the Spring thaw
and they have crossed a few of these cracks already. The snowmobile
makes it across, but it opens the crack too much. Before
he knows it, Krebs, the sled, and the two other students are sinking
fast in icy water. It doesn't help that they're all wearing winter
parkas and heavy snow boots, either. Krebs treads water with one hand
and holds the data notebooks up with the other yelling, "Save the
data! Save the data!!"

<P>

They did save the data, and themselves, fortunately, but his students
never let Krebs forget that day.
Data's hard to come by when you are a wildlife biologist like 
Krebs. You dont do much work in a comfortable laboratory. Your lab is the
great outdoors and since animal life cycles take years, you need
decades of observations and data collection to understand a particular
animal. Even after about 50 years of research, we still don't know exactly 
why populations of lemmings in the North seem to disappear about every
four years. But one thing for sure, we know they do not jump off cliffs.
<P>

<P>

<B>History</B><BR>

Charles ("Charley") Krebs grew up in a small Illinois town near St. Louis,
Missouri. As a kid he remembers fishing for catfish in local rivers with
his grandfather. Charley admired his grandfather and his tales of natural
adventures and wildlife. In particular Krebs was drawn to the Canadian Arctic.
At 8 years old he wanted to be a forest ranger. Even then, he was reading
books about basic ecology and the science of wild animals. All through
his high school years, Krebs had the most amazing summer job. He worked
for a St. Louis fur trading company harvesting seals in the Berring Sea.
Each Summer he went by train 3 days to Seattle, then by boat 7 days up
the coast to these uninhabited Northern islands. Krebs loved it, and he
was curious about all the wildlife on the islands. It's probably because
of these teenage trips that he has become one of the world experts on
Northern animals like lemmings and snowshoe hares.

<P>

After getting his bachelors degree from the U. of Minnesota (1957), Krebs
came to Vancouver, BC to study with Dennis Chitty who was (and still is) the
world expert on lemmings. Krebs obtained an MA (59) and a PhD (62) in Zoology
from UBC. Then, after a 2-year fellowship at Berkeley, he went back home
to teach Zoology at the of Indiana University. But in 1970 Krebs returned 
to Vancouver and has been there ever since as a professor of Zoology at UBC.

<P>

Krebs' textbook called "Ecology" published by Harper-Collins and
now in its fourth edition is used worldwide as the standard teaching
text for ecology courses.
<P>

<HR NOSHADE>

<FONT SIZE="+2"><I><TD><B>The Science</B></I></FONT>

<HR NOSHADE>

Zoology is the study of animals. Krebs is an animal ecologist. 
Ecology is a combination of physiology--the study of the internal
workings of an animal's body--genetics, evolution, and behaviour.
Krebs has spent his working life trying to unravel the mystery of
lemmings and other small Northern mammals whose populations crash
regularly every four to ten years. Hudson's Bay fur trading records
show these fluctuations stretching back for hundreds of years.<P>

In 1965 Krebs tried a simple experiment in an Indiana pasture. 
He simply fenced in an area of grassland the size of a soccer field to see
what would happen to the population of voles living inside the fence.
(The fence extends down into the soil several inches to stop tunneling.)
Amazingly, within a year, he found the population
of voles increased about 5 times. Krebs has spent his working life
trying to explain the "Krebs effect". He says, "You just put a fence up.
You don't do anything to the animals. So what is the fence doing?"
<P>
<IMG SRC=http://fas.sfu.ca/I/css/gcs/graphics/krebs_science.gif>

<P>

1. Lemmings are small rodents that look like guinea pigs. They live
throughout the world in Northern latitudes. Every 4 years their
population increases up to 500 times and then crashes to almost nothing.

<P>

2. The "Fence Effect" also known as the "Krebs Effect" demonstrated
here on Westham Island, BC. A population explosion on the left side
fenced in area has occurred and the voles have eaten everything except
the thistles.

<P>

3. Graph showing the population explosion and crash caused by the fence.
The gray line is for voles in a similar unfenced area. The black line
shows the number of voles over time in the fenced area.

<P>

4. Aggression in voles. Over the years Krebs has systematically eliminated
possible reasons for the Fence Effect. Food is not a factor. You can supply
the fenced in area with unlimited food, and the effect is still observed.
Predators are not the answer. You can make the fence low enough to keep the
voles in but let predators like foxes in. The fence is never a deterrent
for birds of prey like hawks, yet you still see the Fence Effect. Krebs now
believes that the effect is due to social behaviour among the voles. This
includes the natural genetic selection for more aggressive individuals over
the time as living conditions become more crowded. The final crash
seems to be caused by an increased tendency for mothers to kill all the babies
in neighbouring nests.

Objective:<P>

<UL>

<LI> To learn about animals by following their tracks

</UL>


You'll Need:<P>

<UL>

<LI> A trip to the countryside

<LI> A notebook


</UL>

What to do:<P>

<DL>

<DT>

<DD>     

Summer: <BR>
Go to any large grassy field such as those outside most airports,
and literally put your nose to the ground. Part the grass and inch
along parting it in a straight line for at least 10 meters or until
you find a vole runway. It will be an unmistakable runway about
2 or 3 cm wide like the inside of a toilet paper roll. They are like
curving tubes at the bottoms of the grass stems right near where the
stems join the roots. If you don't 
find one on the first try, try again, maybe in a different field.
The runways curve and branch in all directions. Try to draw a map
of the vole runs in a small area of the field.
<P>
Winter: <BR>
If you are in Canada, you probably live somewhere near a spruce forest.
Go cross country skiing or hiking in the forest looking for snowshoe
hare tracks. They look like this:
<IMG SRC=http://fas.sfu.ca/I/css/gcs/graphics/krebs_tracks.gif>
Once you learn to spot the tracks, follow a set and try to determine
what the hare is eating. You can examine their droppings or look
for bits of food the hare dropped while eating. Is there lots of food?
Where is it located? Where do snowshoe hares like to hang out? How
do they avoid predators like lynx and other wildcats?
<P>
If you want to get a feeling for what Charles Krebs does, try to 
count the number of hare tracks that cross your path in a set 
distance, say about 100 meters. Write this in your notebook and
return to the exact same 100 meter stretch next year to count the
number of tracks that cross the path. Repeat this for at least 10
years. Can you see a cycle begin to emerge?
</DL>

<P>

<FONT SIZE="+2"><I><TD><B>Mystery</I></B></FONT>

<HR NOSHADE>

Krebs has still not figured out the mystery of the fence effect entirely, but
one thing he would like to know is: how big does a fenced in area have to be
until the Fence Effect dissappears?

<FONT SIZE="+2"><I><B>The Story</B></I></FONT>
<HR>
It was 1986 and Julia Levy was giving a talk in Waterloo, Ontario.  She
met the people who were doing photodynamic therapy. "For the first
time, I became aware that we were talking about real patients being
treated for real cancer, says Levy. The doctors were very upset with
Johnson & Johnson for closing down their Photofrin research program.
So many people were being helped by this technology but soon they
would not be able to get the drug. " That was a very upsetting
experience for me," says Levy. But it was also very exciting.<P>

That night on the plane flying back to Vancouver she began thinking,
"We're in the business of photodynamic therapy. We should get into
this at the first level and we should maybe start making Photofrin at
least for the Canadian investigators." She sat pondering this the
whole way home and became very excited. She got off the plane in
Vancouver and called her business partner, Jim Miller and said "We've
got to do something." Levy wasn't thinking about big financial take-
overs. She just wanted to help those cancer sufferers. "Let's make the
product. We know how to make it," she said. But Miller replied, "We'll
take over the company." They partnered with the pharmaceutical giant,
American Cyanamid, raised $15 million and did it. That was a major
turning point for Quadra Logic.<P>

"Being in business--in commercial science--focuses your science," says
Levy. "The big difference between University and commercial science,
is not the quality of the research. It's your awareness that as you
move a drug forward towards getting it into a patient, towards getting
a treatment perfected, every step costs about 10 times as much, and
therefore you cannot afford to make mistakes. Maybe that's why it
suits my personality because I don't like retracing my steps anyway. I
like to do it right the first time. You can't afford too many goofs
when a single experiment costs $50,000."<P>

In April of 1993 the Canadian government approved photofrin for the
treatment of bladder cancer. Other cancers of the skin, lung, stomach
and cervix are also treatable.<P>

Levy is now starting a fantastic new program to treat auto-immune
diseases such as arthritis, psoriasis (a skin disease), and multiple
sclerosis with a second generation photodynamic drug called BPD. "It's
way beyond cancer," says Levy. She and her team are curing arthritic
mice by injecting them with BPD and placing them in a red-light box a
few hours later to activate the drug. "We're the only people in the
world doing this," says Levy. "The exciting thing is that everything
we've touched our hands to has turned out positively."<P>

<B>The Young Scientist:</B><P>

Levy grew up in Vancouver. Even as a little girl, she was interested in
biology. On weekends she would come home from Queen's Hall boarding
school in Vancouver and go for walks with her mother in the woods
below 41st avenue. Their dog would romp along collecting stray dogs
who would stay at their house for up to several days. Sometimes Julia
would take a sieve and a jar to bring back frog's eggs so that she and
her sister could grow tadpoles in the basement wash basins. Later:<P>

<LI> She enjoyed mathematics in high school, and had a particularly
inspiring woman biology teacher in grade 11.
<LI> She got a degree in microbiology from UBC.
<LI> She got a PhD at University College in London, Eng.
<LI> Became a professor of microbiology at UBC.
<LI> Founded her own drug company, Quadra Logic Technologies Inc., with
several other university professors.

1. Photodynamic drug injected into the blood stream.<P>
2. Lipoproteins in blood carry the drug to all parts of the body.<P>
3. BPD (BenzoPorphyrin Derivative) drug developed by Levy and company is transported in the blood inside lipoprotein, a complex protein that carries fatty material.<P>
4. BPD brought inside cancer cell by lipoprotein.<P>
5. Cancer Cell. Several hours after the injection, cancer cells, which grow faster than normal cells accumulate ten times more BPD than normal cells in the body.<P>
6. Fibre-optic <A HREF="http://www.phys.soton.ac.uk/pgbook/laser.htm">Laser</A> Into Lung. Using a fibre optic scope, doctors can enter the lung and find the cancer tissue. Then red laser light with the wavelength of 690nm is sent down the fibre optic probe. The light activates the BPD molecules creating free oxygen molecules which react with the cancer cell and effectively "burn" it up.<P>
7. Cancer tumour in lung being destroyed by photodynamic therapy.<P>

<HR>

<B>Activity:</B>
To understand why Levy and her team use red laser light to
activate their photodynamic drugs, try this experiment.<P>

<B>You'll Need:</B><P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC=http://fas.sfu.ca/I/css/gcs/graphics/levy_flashlight.gif>
<BR>
 A good flashlight.<P>
</CENTER>
<B>What to do:</B>
<LI> Turn on the flashlight and put your hand over it, or put
your mouth around the bright end.
<LI> What colour is the light that you see through your hand or
cheeks?
<P>
<B>Why it works:</B>
Our bodies are mostly transparent to red light. The red laser light at
690 nanometer wavelength that Levy uses to activate photodynamic drugs
passes right through skin and flesh. Even hemoglobin, the protein that
makes blood red, does not absorb red light at that wavelength.<P>

<B>Why do you think red light passes through our bodies?</B><P>

<HR NOSHADE>

Holding his half full gourd of "chicha", Walter Lewis smiles, wishing

he

didn't have to drink another drop. It tastes so sour, like a

combination

of yoghurt, warm beer and mashed potatoes. But the headman--the

apu of the Achuar

Jivura village in the Amazonian jungle--is looking him right in

the eye. To refuse this friendship ceremony drink would be an insult

to his hosts.

<P>

Lewis takes another look at the yellowish liquid in his gourd. He

knows that Achuar women make chicha by chewing a kind of tapioca

root and

spitting it into a huge bowl to ferment in their own saliva. The air

in the open hut is wet and hot. Lewis feels his shirt stick to the

sweat on his back as he turns to see his wife sitting among the women

just

outside the men's circle. A smoldering cooking fire gives everything

the

smell of smoked fish. The forest outside is alive with shrieking

jungle birds while pet parrots, monkeys and dogs squawk and bark,

leaping among the crowd of gawking naked children surrounding Lewis

and his wife Memory Elvin-Lewis. "We are the zoo," thinks Lewis as he

takes a final sip of the sour tasting brew like a good ethnobotanist.

<P>

Mariano the headman is telling Lewis about the healing powers of a

certain plant whose roots are used to help women through the final

stages of childbirth. The Lewis's have travelled to the Peruvian

jungle in search of new plants that might yield new drugs. They are

ethnobotanists and they specialize in communicating with native

peoples around the world to learn of previously undocumented

traditional medicines.

<P>

While Walter is talking to the headman, Memory notices a big grin on

the face of an old woman in the back row. (In Achuar culture women do

not sit with the men, but have their own special area within the

hut.) Memory quietly goes to talk to the old woman who turns out to

be Mariano's aunty. She takes memory outside to show her the plant

Mariano is talking about, all the while telling her how men don't

know much about this medicine, since it's strictly used by women.

When Memory sees the plant she realizes immediately that it's not

the root the Achuar use, but rather the leaf. On closer inspection

later, Walter discovers that it's not the leaf that has the medicinal

quality, but a fungus which grows on the topmost leaves of the plant.

<P>

The Lewis's credit many of their discoveries to the way they work as

a

team. If Walter had been in the jungle on his own perhaps he never

would have discovered this medicine, since as a man, he would

probably

not talk to the women of the tribe, and he would have embarked on a

futile search looking for the active ingredient in the roots of the

plant.

<P>

The Lewis's have collected thousands of plants and found dozens of

traditional medicines which require authentication by modern biomedical

and chemical analytical techniques. These include a wound healing sap

 that makes cuts and scrapes heal

30% faster, various antimalarial plants, anti-arthritis plants, and

more. Three quarters of all drugs come directly or indirectly from plants used in

folk medicine and the Lewis's are trying deperately to catalog the

thousands of plants used by tropical rain-forest cultures

before the forests are chopped down.

<P>

<H3>History</H3>

<B>Walter Lewis</B><P>

When Walter was 12 his dad asked him what he wanted for his birthday.

The Lewis family lived in Victoria, BC and Walter was fascinated by

an

uncle who had a nursery  where he grew plants in the countryside.

Walter told his dad he'd like a greenhouse for his birthday and his

father gave him one. It was made of wood and glass and was about 3m

long and 2m wide with planting benches on each long wall. Walter's

uncle

taught him how to grow roses from cuttings. The next summer Walter

began selling his roses in Victoria.

<P>

His mom and dad wanted him to become a dentist. Walter went to

Victoria College (which later became the University of Victoria) to

study towards dentistry, but he took extra botany courses on the side

to satisfy his curiousity about plants. After second year university

he announced to his parents that he would become a botanist, not a

dentist.

<P>

<B>Memory Elvin-Lewis</B><P>

When Memory was a girl her father, who was a physician, took her with

him on his house calls and as a teenager she helped in his office. She was fascinated

by all things scientific and her father encouraged her by helping

her understand what he did.

She was not like other girls at Queens Hall school for girls and wanted to go

to public school (Prince of Wales) where she believed she would get a better education. 

In high-school she always topped the class in science. As a teenager she volunteered

in the St. John Ambulance Brigade and became a sargent.

<P>

At the University of British Columbia when she took her first

microbiology course she remembers thinking, "This is it!" 
<P>
In the mid-60s Memory and her co-workers recorded a case of a

young boy dying of strange natural causes. Nobody could understand

the boy's case history or understand why he died, so blood specimens 

were put away and frozen. Twenty

years later when the disease of AIDS was characterized, Memory recognized

the symptoms and had the boy's frozen blood analysed. The case is now

recognized as the first recorded case of AIDS in America.

<P>

<HR NOSHADE>

<FONT SIZE="+2"><I><TD><B>The Science</B></I></FONT>

<HR NOSHADE>

Ethnobotany is the study of plants by obtaining information from

people around the world. The Lewis's specialize in discovering new

drugs from plants used in folk medicine by native tribes in South

America and other tropical parts of the world.

<P>

The tropical jungles which make up the primary source for such plants

are disappearing. At the same time the people who know how to use

these plants are becoming "acculturated", that is they are becoming

more Westernized and they are losing their traditional culture and

knowledge of the forest.The Lewis's and people like them are trying

desperately to catalogue as many medicinal plants as they can before

it is too late.

<P>

<IMG SRC=http://fas.sfu.ca/css/gcs/graphics/lewis_science.gif>

<H3>1. The Hut</H3>

The Achuar hut sits in a clearing in the forest. Inside several

families live together. Unmarried and widowed women live at one end. 

Meetings are held at the other

around a Snake Stool where the headman or apu sits. Open fires

burn on the floor and the smoke goes out a hole in the roof.

<H3>2. A Achuar Elder</H3>

Now dead, this wise elder taught the Lewis's much about the medicinal

plants of the Achuar.

<H3>3. Gourd with Holly leaves</H3>

Each morning before dawn the Achuar men drink guayus, a very strong

caffeine containing drink made from these leaves. Each man usually

drinks about a litre (4 cups). Within 45 minutes they vomit about half of it back

up. The vomiting is not caused by the guayus but is a custom of the

tribe. When boys reach maturity they join the men in the morning

ritual of drinking and regurgitating guayus.

<H3>4. Methylergonovine</H3>

A chemical structure similar to the active ingredient in the ergot

fungus the Lewis's found growing on a plant used by

Achuar women to aid in childbirth.

<P>



<HR NOSHADE>

<FONT SIZE="+2"><I><TD><B>Activity</I></B></FONT>

<HR NOSHADE>

To get a feeling for what it's like to be an ethnobotanist look

around

your house for six different things made out of wood. Try to identify

what type of wood was used, where the wood came from and how it was

made into the final product. Can you ask your "tribal elders" (your

parents or teachers) if they know where the wood came from? What does

the origin of the wood tell you about you and your family?

<P>

Another place to be like an ethnobotanist is the grocery store.

Try to find out where certain produce comes from. Ethnic grocery

stores like Chinese, East Indian, or West Indian stores are good places to look. See

if you can find an unfamiliar fruit or vegetable and 

get somebody in the store to explain how to prepare it. 

Remember to watch for non-verbal clues and tricks of language. 

Where does the vegetable grow? How is it

used? We depend on people from other cultures around the world because

the knowledge they have about preparing

foods and medicines enriches our lives every day.

<P>

<HR NOSHADE>

<FONT SIZE="+2"><I><TD><B>Mystery</I></B></FONT>

<HR NOSHADE>

In the Peruvian jungle the Achuar have shown the Lewis's a

plant that they use to treat "the frightened people". The

Lewis's do not know what the Achuar people mean by this, but they

feel if this mystery could be solved then a new drug for

anxiety or mental illness might be discovered.
