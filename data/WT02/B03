<h1>CANNABIS IN CONTEXT: HISTORY, LAWS AND INTERNATIONAL TREATIES
</h1>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.GIF"><br>
</p>

<h3>Definitions </h3>

<p> In 1978 the South Australian Royal Commission into the
Non-Medical Use of Drugs issued a comprehensive discussion paper
on cannabis ([1]South Australia 1978). It proposed a general and
a specific definition of cannabis along the following lines.
Cannabis generally refers to 'the cannabis plant and any
preparations made from the plant, including the dried leaves and
flowering tops, resinous material separated from the plant and
refined oil' ([2]South Australia 1978, p.i). </p>

<p> Like the word 'marijuana', 'cannabis' is also used to refer
specifically to the 'dried preparations of the plant itself'
([3]South Australia 1978, p.i). The words 'cannabis resin' and
'hashish' are used when referring to the resin of the cannabis
flower. Cannabis is a Latin word meaning hemp. The expressions
'hemp' or 'Indian hemp' are particularly used in older documents
cited in this chapter and refer to the whole of the cannabis
plant. </p>

<h3>Cannabis in history </h3>

<p> From its earliest recorded uses, cannabis has been important
in commerce and warfare. Its fibrous stems have been used to make
textiles, paper, ropes and bowstrings. Cannabis has been employed
as a medicine and as a psychoactive drug for social and religious
purposes. Cannabis seeds have been used as an ingredient in the
manufacture of soap, lamp oil, paint and varnish ([4]Abel 1980,
p.x) and as bird seed. </p>

<p> According to[5] Abel (1980), the earliest recorded use of
cannabis occurred in Taiwan, approximately 10,000 years ago. It
also appears to have been used in China as early as the second
century BC for clothing, shoes, bowstrings and for its
anaesthetic properties. In India, it is known to have been
utilised for its psychoactive properties in religious ceremonies
and was an ingredient in three preparations - bhang, ganja and
charas. Its use has been documented in Asia Minor - in Turkey -
as early as 1,000 BC. Both the Greeks and Romans recorded its
efficacy as a medicine - especially for treating earache. One
particular example of its use in the Middle East must be detailed
because of its influence on misconceptions about the properties
of the drug. Between the 11th and 13th centuries AD, a sect known
as the Assassins, followers of Hasan-ibn-Sabah, dominated the
Middle East through a reign of terror. Marco Polo reported that
the Assassins used a drug. He did not identify hashish as this
drug and it appears, in any case, that the drug used by the
Assassins was not used to rouse them to bloody deeds. However, in
the 19th century a number of European writers claimed that the
word 'Assassin' was a derivation of the word 'hashish'. A link
was thus forged and popularised associating cannabis and
violence; an association that was repeated in the 20th century in
the anti-cannabis writings of Harry Anslinger, chief of the
United States Federal Bureau of Narcotics [6](Abel 1980). </p>

<p> In the Middle Ages cannabis was used for its psychoactive
effects as well as commercially. Its use as a mind-altering drug
was widespread in Egypt and seems to date from around the 13th
century. In medieval Europe cannabis appears to have been
employed as a folk medicine, particularly for the treatment of
toothache and rheumatism, and in childbirth. Its role in
witchcraft resulted in a Papal fiat in the 15th century which
condemned witchcraft and the use of hemp in the satanic mass
[7](Abel 1980). Its major use in Europe during the Middle Ages
and into the time of the colonial expansion of the European
powers was to produce ropes and cordage - especially for ships'
rigging and anchor ropes. In Italy, hemp was a major crop,
particularly important in establishing states such as Venice as
seafaring powers. The Venetians operated a state-run hemp factory
as a way of achieving quality assurance. </p>

<p> The historical importance of hemp is evidenced by a decree
issued by Henry VIII in 1533 that 'for every sixty acres of
arable land a farmer owned, a quarter acre was to be sown with
hemp. The penalty for not doing so was to be three shillings and
four pence' [8](Abel 1980, pp72-3). Hemp cultivation was clearly
a vital ingredient in enabling aspiring maritime powers to
exploit the riches of the New World. However, despite the threat
of penalties, the British had little success in stimulating the
production of cannabis domestically. They were more successful in
their American colonies: </p>

<p> 'During the 17th century Indian hemp was the basis of the
American Colonialists' trade and commerce, and so great was the
need to equip the British Navy that James I issued a Royal Decree
to instruct colonialists to increase their hemp production'
[9](Hindmarch 1972, p254). It appears that more widespread use of
cannabis in Europe for its psychoactive effects dates from the
period of colonial expansion. </p>

<p> Interest in cannabis and other drugs was stimulated by the
diaries and journals of travellers who described the use of
cannabis and other drugs in Africa, India and Asia Minor, and by
reports from soldiers in colonial armies who experimented with
cannabis while serving overseas. One of the first Western
publications on drugs was Garcia Da Orta's Colloquies on the
Simples and Drugs of India published in 1563, which described the
effects of bhang (a concoction containing cannabis). This
publication was followed by several other books by European
adventurers published in the latter part of the sixteenth
century. These works were not only important in spreading
knowledge of cannabis' psychoactive properties, but in
popularising misconceptions about the drug. </p>

<p> For example, a widespread belief that the effects of
consuming opium and bhang (which contained both opium and
cannabis) were identical can be dated from this period. It
appears both in the works of the Dutchman John Huyghen van
Linschoten and the Portuguese Fray Sebastien. The linkage between
cannabis and violent and dangerous behaviour also dates from
around this time - in particular, from the writings of the
Orientalist Silvestre de Sacy. Colonial expansion and colonial
wars also brought with them new understandings in Europe of the
medical uses of cannabis. [10]Abel (1980) claims that by the 17th
century 'the medicinal properties of the plant were fairly well
known to the medical profession' (p116) and by 1682, cannabis
seeds were listed in the New London Dispensatory as a remedy for
coughs and jaundice. </p>

<p> In addition to increasing interest in cannabis being shown by
scientists and doctors, hashish (and other drugs such as opium)
became known to European students, writers and artists. In
England, Egyptian hashish sweets such as Turkish Delight were
eaten by university students. In the 19th century, hashish was
used by the French Hashish Club which numbered among its members
Theophile Gautier, Alexandre Dumas, Victor Hugo and Eugene
Delacroix. While not so popular among English writers and
artists, it was used around the turn of the century by the
Decadents including WB Yeats and Ernest Dawson. For French and
English writers, hashish, like other drugs, was taken to give
them new experiences to write about, as a plot device, and it was
employed to enhance creativity. </p>

<p> Another important aspect of the colonial experience in the
spread of cannabis to Western Europe is seen in the work of W.B.
O'Shaughnessy, an Irish doctor posted to India who is credited
with introducing cannabis to Western medicine [11](Abel 1980).
While in India he experimented with cannabis in the treatment of
a wide range of diseases including rheumatism, cholera, tetanus
and epilepsy, and was enthusiastic enough about its usefulness to
commission its conversion to a form suitable for medicinal use.
This extract was widely prescribed for childbirth, migraine,
insomnia, coughs and the treatment of opium withdrawal [12](Abel
1980). </p>

<p> However, Western use of cannabis for medicinal purposes did
not extend much beyond the first few decades of the 20th century.
The medical profession turned its attention to other drugs and
other methods of administration. The science of organic chemistry
enabled drugs like morphine and cocaine to be isolated, and
chemical synthesis of drugs such as heroin to occur [13](Musto
1991). The hypodermic syringe was invented in 1845 and enabled
more efficient administration of drugs. Morphine was isolated in
1803 and unlike cannabis was water soluble and thus injectable
[14](Abel 1980). </p>

<p> Further, the growth of the pharmaceutical industry enabled
the new drugs to be mass produced, advertised and distributed
[15](Musto 1991). In addition, the strength of commercially
available cannabis varied considerably, and administration of the
same amounts of the drug appeared to elicit different responses
in different patients. There were reports of adverse effects in
patients [16](Manderson 1993). </p>

<p> In contrast, drugs like morphine and later heroin were
enthusiastically embraced by doctors because they were
fast-acting, and provided reliable and very effective pain
relief. Some use of cannabis for medical purposes did remain.
Until the late 1930s 'Parke Davis, Eli Lilly and Squibb ...
marketed preparations of cannabis extract and promoted them for
the treatment of asthma, tension and pain' [17](South Australia
1978, p98). Cannabis appeared as 'extractum cannabis' in the
United States Pharmacopoeia until 1942 (Australia 1977). In
Australia, tincture of cannabis was used until the mid-1960s
[18](Caswell 1992). </p>

<p> Medical and scientific interest in cannabis has largely been
dormant until recently. In the United States renewed attention is
being given to its possible therapeutic properties, particularly
as an anti-emetic for cancer chemotherapy patients and as an
agent for reducing intra-ocular pressure in glaucoma sufferers
([19]Trebach &amp; Zeese 1990). Some scientific debate is also
occurring in Australia [20](Caswell 1992; see also [21]Appendix
1). </p>

<p> If non-medical consumption of cannabis in the 19th and early
20th centuries was regarded as a problem at all, it was in
respect of its use by colonised peoples and minority groups.
However, in relation to colonised peoples, the attitudes of the
Western powers were far from consistent. For example, cannabis
was widely used in India and Egypt - both subject to British
rule. In Egypt, local officials and foreign rulers, including the
Turks, attempted to suppress its use in the 19th century. The
British, who received no revenues from Egyptian cannabis
production, supported these attempts. </p>

<p> The situation was more complex in India. The British
government initially appears to have had little interest in
cannabis use among Indians. British complacency was no doubt
largely due to the fact that, since 1798, the government had
licensed the manufacture and sale of hemp drugs in India and
received considerable revenues as a result. However, pressure
from local Indian administrators and later from their British
counterparts - concerned that cannabis use was contributing to
crime, illness and social unrest - finally resulted in the
establishment of the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission in 1893. The
Commission reported in 1894. Loss of revenue if cannabis were to
be banned was a factor in the Hemp Commission's conclusion that
prohibition would not be justified. Other important
considerations for the Commission were lack of evidence about the
ill effects of cannabis, the difficulties of enforcing
prohibition and the important place of the drug in the religious
and social life of the sub-continent. </p>

<p> The use of cannabis by Black Africans was largely ignored by
the colonial powers. However, South Africa had concerns about
cannabis use among Indians brought to work in the colony. In 1870
a law was passed forbidding the smoking, use or possession of
hemp by Indians. </p>

<p> In the United States, anxiety about cannabis use was
associated with its possession by poor ethnic groups. It appears
to have been used first by Mexican refugees fleeing into the
south-western states from the 1910 Revolution. The earliest US
laws proscribing the use of cannabis can be found in those
states. Cannabis use later spread to the Black population. By
1937 there were prohibitions on cannabis across the country. </p>

<h3>Development of international treaties </h3>

<p> Australian drug laws, like those of many other countries,
closely follow the development of international drug laws, so in
this section the growth of international drug treaties will be
described. These treaties are designed to control the
international traffic in certain drugs and to encourage domestic
restrictions on their supply and use. </p>

<p> The influence of the United States in the conception and
development of these instruments has been enormous. Justice
Michael Kirby has characterised the degree of international
cooperation brought about by the fear of drugs as 'exceptional'
(1992, p312). However, fear was not the only ingredient in early
crusading by the United States for international action. A
complex array of factors was at work. </p>

<p> The first international meeting on drugs was concerned with
opium and, in particular, with Britain's opium trade with China.
It was attended by 13 nations and held in Shanghai in 1909. At
the Shanghai Conference the United States argued for a total
prohibition on opium, and was opposed by the United Kingdom.
According to [22]Abel (1980) the background to the meeting was as
follows. </p>

<p> In 1882 the United States Congress passed the Chinese
Exclusion Act. In retaliation, China prohibited the importation
of American manufactured goods: Faced with the loss of the
lucrative Chinese market, and aware of China's efforts to
eradicate its own domestic opium problem, President Theodore
Roosevelt convened an international conference in 1909 in
Shanghai to help China eradicate the problem of opium addiction
among its inhabitants. By trying to impress China with its
goodwill and concern about her drug crisis, the United States
hoped to change China's attitude towards American goods'
[23](Abel, p193). </p>

<p> While economic factors were undoubtedly important in
precipitating US action, they were not the only considerations.
Fear of social unrest, racist attitudes and moral crusading all
played a part. In addition: Missionaries from the United States
in China had long been publicising the source and the pernicious
effects of opium smoking among the Chinese. Given the role of
England in that trade, the [Indian Hemp Commission] report seemed
like a whitewash for British commercial purposes and fanned
American progressive opinion even further against the European
imperialists in Asia [24](South Australia 1979, p42). </p>

<p> The 1909 conference did not produce an international treaty.
Another international drugs conference was held in 1912. At the
1912 Hague Conference some 46 nations discussed morphine,
cocaine, cannabis and heroin, as well as opium. The outcome of
the conference was the Hague Convention for the Suppression of
Opium and Other Drugs. It required the parties to 'confine to
medical and legitimate purposes the manufacture, sale and use of
opium, heroin, morphine and cocaine' [25](quoted in Manderson
1993, p63) Both the United States and Italy wanted cannabis
included in the Convention, but they were unsuccessful. </p>

<p> The 1925 Geneva Convention on Opium and Other Drugs was a
more significant document. As a result of lobbying by Egypt,
Turkey and South Africa, who were supported by the United States,
cannabis was included in the Convention. The Convention also
created an international scheme for the monitoring and control of
traffic in narcotic drugs, together with an administrative agency
- the Permanent Central Opium Board. Import and export quotas
were established, as well as statistical reporting requirements.
The Convention required the parties to 'enact effective laws to
limit exclusively to medical and scientific purposes the
manufacture, import, sale, distribution, export and use of
cannabis in the form used for medical purposes at the time'
[26](South Australia 1978, p34). Significantly, the word
'legitimate' which appeared in the 1912 Hague Convention was
removed from the 1925 Geneva Convention. </p>

<p> Finally, the Narcotics Limitation Convention of 1931 targeted
the manufacture of narcotics and required the parties to limit it
to scientific and medical purposes. Controls on licit manufacture
were seen as important, because apart from illicit imports from
abroad, leakage from the licit market was a source of illicit use
in Western nations. . </p>

<h3>Inquiries into drug use and trafficking </h3>

<p> The number of inquiries into drug use and trafficking have
been legion - both in Australia and overseas. Three common
features are seen in many of them. First, many question the
alleged ill effects of cannabis use. Second, some make
recommendations for law reform. Third, most inquiries have had
little impact on public policy or legislative change in relation
to cannabis use. </p>

<p> In Australia, for example, governments have generally
preferred to rely on law enforcement, treatment and education in
their quest to reduce drug use [27](Hartland et al. 1992). They
have been far less ready to embrace a philosophical shift in
policy towards minimising the harm resulting from drug use or to
tackle politically sensitive issues such as cannabis law reform.
As mentioned earlier, the first inquiry relating to cannabis
dates from 1893 when the British administration in India
established the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission. The Commission
heard nearly 1,200 submissions, both oral and written. It had a
wide mandate, including the effects of cannabis use on 'the moral
and social life of the people of India' [28](Abel 1980, p127).
While the Commission found that excessive use of cannabis could
lead to mental disorders, immorality and susceptibility to
disease, it concluded that the evidence demonstrated 'most
clearly how little injury society has hitherto sustained from
hemp drugs' [29](quoted in Abel 1980, p131). In particular, the
Commission reported that moderate use had no appreciable physical
or mental effects, did not induce immoral behaviour and had
little connection with crime. </p>

<p> Other major overseas inquiries that failed to discover any
dependence-producing properties in cannabis, harm as a
consequence of moderate use, a strong link with crime or a
progressive effect leading inexorably to use of drugs such as
heroin, cocaine or morphine were: </p>

<ul>
    <li>the Panama Canal Zone Military Investigations
        (1916-1929); </li>
    <li>the La Guardia Committee Report 1944 - United States; </li>
    <li>the Report of the Hallucinogens Sub-Committee of the
        United Kingdom Advisory Committee on Drug Dependence 1968
        (Wootton Report); </li>
    <li>the report of the Commission of Inquiry into the
        Non-Medical Use of Drugs 1972 (Le Dain Commission) -
        Canada; and </li>
    <li>the report of the National Commission on Marihuana and
        Drug Abuse 1972 (Shafer Commission) - United States. </li>
</ul>

<p> In addition, both the Le Dain and Shafer reports contained
proposals for law reform. The Shafer report recommended
decriminalisation of: </p>

<ul>
    <li>possession of marijuana for personal use in private; and </li>
    <li>casual distribution in private of small amounts of
        marijuana for no or insignificant remuneration
        ([30]United States 1972, pp152-4). </li>
    <li>It also recommended that possession in public of an ounce
        or less of marijuana should not be an offence but should
        be subject to seizure [31](United States 1972, pp152-4). </li>
    <li>The Le Dain Commission recommended that simple possession
        offences be repealed. </li>
</ul>

<p> Other overseas investigations which failed to uncover
unequivocal evidence about the harmful effects of cannabis were a
study of the United States Institute of Mental Health entitled
Ganja in Jamaica (1975), and a United States government study on
Costa Rica (1975). It should not be surmised, however, that
overseas investigations have all concluded that cannabis use
presented no risks to drug users. United Nations reports
published between 1973 and 1974 found that cannabis use was
likely to lead to dependence, and resulted in public health and
social problems. A 1974 US Senate report on Marihuana-Hashish
Epidemic and its Impact on US Security reported that cannabis use
resulted in brain damage, amotivational syndrome, and genetic and
reproductive defects. </p>

<p> In Australia, there have been a large number of Parliamentary
inquiries and Royal Commissions into drug use and drug
trafficking. In 1971 the Senate Select Committee on Drug
Trafficking and Drug Abuse (the Marriott Committee) was
established. Its brief included investigation into the incidence,
distribution and causes of drug use, and the adequacy of
legislation and educational programs. It concluded that penalties
for drug use should be commensurate with the different degrees of
harm presented by different drugs, that young, first offenders
should be treated leniently and that penalties for trafficking
should be severe. However, its recommendations were cautious:
that, pending further sociological and medical research, 'present
restrictions on the use of cannabis drugs should be retained in
Australia' (Australia 1971, p91). </p>

<p> The Marriott Committee report was followed in 1977 by one of
the most significant Australian inquiries into drugs. In that
year, the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare (the Baume
Committee) produced its report Drug Problems in Australia - an
Intoxicated Society? which looked at the use of licit and illicit
drugs in Australia. Like other reports, before and since, it
recognised differing harms produced by different drugs and
concluded that drug use was more a social/medical problem than a
legal one. It also considered the social and personal harms
flowing from the illegal status of some drugs and recommended
that: </p>

<ul>
    <li>'legal controls [should] not [be] of such a nature as to
        inhibit rehabilitation of the user or to cause more
        social damage than use of the drug causes' (Australia
        1977, p164); </li>
    <li>cannabis legislation should be enacted that 'recognises
        the significant differences between opiate narcotics and
        cannabis in their health effects and in the criminal
        impact on users and the community' (Australia 1977,
        p164); </li>
    <li>possession of marijuana for personal use should no longer
        be a criminal offence and should attract only a fine; </li>
    <li>penalties for possession of hashish, hashish oil and
        purified THC should remain at their present levels
        because of the potency of these drugs. </li>
</ul>

<p> Commonwealth Government response to the Baume Committee
report was both tardy and hostile. [32]Hartland (1991) quotes
Senator Baume's view of that response: </p>

<p> The Prime Minister of the day, rather than come and say I was
a fink, did something cleverer. He appointed a learned
conservative Judge to head up a Royal Commission into Drugs with
terms of reference which virtually made it inevitable that the
learned Judge would bring out a report which said we need more
social control, heavier penalties, more enforcement authorities,
and don't change the laws (p63). </p>

<p> In 1978 the New South Wales Joint Parliamentary Committee
upon Drugs handed down its Report into Drug Abuses. Its mandate
was to examine the effects, use and supply of drugs of dependence
together with policy issues. Alcohol and tobacco were not
included in the Committee's terms of reference. The Committee
expressed concern about 'the growing social stress that must be
arising from the fact that a great many young adults, by
indulging in a drug which they see as less damaging than alcohol,
run the risk not only of involvement with the criminal law, but
also have the prospect of ruined careers' [33](New South Wales
1978, p76). The report and the Committee's earlier Memorandum to
the New South Wales Parliament recommended that: </p>

<ul>
    <li>personal use of cannabis no longer be a criminal offence;
    </li>
    <li>first offenders be given bonds and probation and on
        successful completion of these, all records be expunged;
        and </li>
    <li>penalties for trafficking in cannabis be severe. </li>
</ul>

<p> The next major inquiry was the Australian Royal Commission of
Inquiry into Drugs (Williams Royal Commission). Its multi-volume
report was released in 1979. Rather than considering the degree
of harm produced by different drugs, the Williams Royal
Commission took the view that cannabis was not a harmless drug
because it produced an intoxicating effect. It concluded that
removal of prohibitions against cannabis would depart from the
intention and spirit of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs,
have a 'domino effect' in that it would stimulate calls for the
relaxation of prohibitions on other drugs, and send a signal to
the community that drug use was acceptable. </p>

<p> The Williams Royal Commission recommended that consideration
of relaxation of prohibitions on cannabis not occur for 10 years,
during which time information about the drug and its use would be
collected by National and State Drug Information Centres.
Although the Commonwealth government set up a National Drug
Information Centre, the State and Territory centres were not
established - making the review recommended by Williams
impossible. </p>

<p> Like the Baume Committee report that preceded it, the report
of the South Australian Royal Commission into the Non-Medical Use
of Drugs (the Sackville Royal Commission) prompted little
government response to its recommendations. In relation to
cannabis, the Commission dismissed the progression theory and
remarked that where cannabis users also consumed other illicit
drugs, this was due to the illegal status of cannabis itself. </p>

<p> The Committee made wide-ranging recommendations, including
the repeal of the offence of use or administration of drugs, and
the establishment of drug assessment and aid panels. Some of its
most radical proposals related to cannabis and cannabis resin. It
recommended that 'cultivation [of cannabis] for personal use, use
in private and small-scale gratuitous distribution in private to
adults ...[should] not be a criminal offence ... No distinction
... [should] be made between cannabis and cannabis resin, but
cannabis oil ... [should] remain subject to a policy of total
prohibition' ([34]South Australia 1979, p375). </p>

<p> The Commission found no evidence to 'support the view that
cannabis [was] associated with a tendency towards aggression and
violent crime' ([35]South Australia 1979, p51). In addition, the
Commission questioned some of the psychological and physiological
ill effects attributed to cannabis, such as amotivational
syndrome and psychosis (though it concluded that there was some
small risk of brain damage). In general, it did not dramatise the
possible adverse effects of cannabis use, recognising the
existence of equivocal research findings and insufficient data. </p>

<p> The next major Australian inquiry which touched on cannabis
was the investigation by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the
National Crime Authority which reported in 1989. Its terms of
reference included the scope and nature of the trade in illegal
drugs, the efficacy of law enforcement, and the costs and
efficacy of prohibition. It concluded that: 'If the aim of the
policy [of prohibition] was to reduce the use of prohibited
substances, or even to minimise access to them, it has clearly
failed' (Australia 1989, p92), And it concluded that 'should the
latest initiatives fail to make any significant inroads on the
market then it would be appropriate to consider some relaxation
of the present prohibitionism as an alternative policy' (p123).
Before concluding this section, a number of recent inquiries into
drugs should be mentioned. </p>

<p> In 1991 the ACT Legislative Assembly Select Committee on HIV,
Illegal Drugs and Prostitution tabled its report on Marijuana and
Other Illegal Drugs. The focus of the report was on the
'effectiveness of the current legal and social controls on drug
taking, with particular reference to marijuana' [36](Australian
Capital Territory 1991, p1). Proceeding from a belief in harm
minimisation and the view that drug use can never be completely
eliminated, the Committee recommended that: </p>

<ul>
    <li>possession of up to 25g of cannabis no longer be an
        offence; </li>
    <li>possession of more than 25g of cannabis and less than
        100g of cannabis attract a fine of $150; </li>
    <li>possession of more than 100g of cannabis should incur a
        penalty of $5,000 or two years imprisonment, or both; </li>
    <li>cultivation of five cannabis plants should no longer be
        an offence; and </li>
    <li>there should be no offence of self-administration in
        respect to cannabis. </li>
</ul>

<p> Another recent inquiry into illicit drugs was undertaken by
the New South Wales Legislative Council's Standing Committee on
Social Issues. However, at the date of writing, the Committee's
report had not been completed and there have been suggestions
that it will not be (Symonds 1992). In South Australia, a
Legislative Council Select Committee on the Control and Illegal
Use of Drugs of Dependence has been established. Among other
things it has been charged with reporting on the effectiveness of
current drug laws in controlling drug trafficking, the costs of
enforcing anti-trafficking laws and the social impacts of
criminal activity flowing from illicit drug use and trafficking.
In Queensland, an Advisory Committee on Illicit drugs was
established in the aftermath of the Fitzgerald Committee of
Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police
Misconduct. The Committee made cannabis the subject of its first
discussion paper for a number of reasons. Among these were the
fact that cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug and the
illicit drug having the greatest impact on the criminal justice
system. The Committee is now seeking submissions on 'preferred
legislative, enforcement and social responses to the issues of
cannabis use and production' [37](Queensland 1993, p3). </p>

<p> Before embarking on a description of the development and
present content of Australian drug laws, it should be stated that
the Australian Constitution contains no general power to
legislate on crime. While many Commonwealth criminal laws have
been enacted incidental to the heads of power enumerated in the
Constitution, criminal laws have largely been the province of the
States. For this reason, the focus of this section is on State
and Territory legislation. </p>

<p> As[38] Manderson (1993) has remarked, consumption of drugs in
the 19th century was largely a matter of personal choice. Drugs -
including the opiates - were available from a wide variety of
sources including medical practitioners, pharmacists,
homoeopaths, sellers of patent medicines and grocers. Unlike the
opiates, however, cannabis was little known or used in the
Australia until the 1960s. There were some exceptions. For
example, medicinal use of cannabis occurred in the 19th century
and to a minor extent, in the 20th century. Cigares de Joy
(cannabis cigarettes) were sold over the counter in Australia
into the 20th century [39](Manderson, 1993). </p>

<p> However, according to [40]Manderson (1993) 'As late as 1938
Smith's Weekly reported &quot;the first appearance in
Australia&quot; of &quot;a Mexican drug that drives men and women
to the wildest excesses ... distorts moral values and leads to
degrading sexual extravagances&quot;' (p72). This drug was, of
course, cannabis. </p>

<p> A number of forces coalesced in the development of drug laws
in Australia. The first laws - poisons acts - specified certain
drugs required to be sold by medical practitioners or chemists
and stipulated labelling requirements [41](Carney 1981). However,
these labelling requirements did not apply to drugs sold under
medical prescription, to patent medicines or to homoeopathic
preparations [42](Manderson 1993, p9). </p>

<p> According to the Joint Parliamentary Committee (Australia
1989) these early controls were instituted in response to the use
of arsenic in suicides, poisonings and homicides. In 1862, South
Australia enacted the first Australian statute regulating the
sale and use of poisons [43](Carney 1981). In 1876 New South
Wales and Victoria followed with Sale and Use of Poisons Acts.
Most importantly, these early laws generally did not stipulate
who could use drugs or for what purposes [44](Fox &amp; Mathews
1992). </p>

<p> The first laws conceptualising drugs as a problem were
enacted in the 19th century and were the product of racism and
the temperance movement [45](Carney 1981). This phase of
legislative controls on the supply and use of prohibited drugs
has been characterised as involving 'the application of criminal
penalties to certain activities related to drugs, particularly
the supply of opium, which had not previously attracted legal
sanctions' [46](South Australia 1978, p33). Early laws singled
out opium smoking - a practice of Chinese immigrants who had come
to Australia in the mid-19th century during the Gold Rush. There
were two targets - the Chinese themselves and the Aboriginal
people believed to be financially and sexually exploited by the
Chinese who provided them with opium. </p>

<p> In 1891 Queensland passed the Sale and Use of Poisons Act
which proscribed the supply of opium to Aboriginal people, except
for medicinal purposes. Later other States enacted laws directed
at opium smoking - South Australia passed the Opium Act 1895, and
Victoria passed the Opium Smoking Prohibition Act 1905 and the
Police Offences (Amendment) Act 1908. The Commonwealth, by a 1905
Proclamation, banned the importation of opium suitable for
smoking. </p>

<p> While racism was a very significant force in the development
of early Australian drug laws, other influences were also at
work. The late 19th century witnessed a movement away from
laissez-faire attitudes towards greater interventionism and a
belief in the efficacy of law in promoting social and moral goals
[47](Manderson 1993). It witnessed a struggle for supremacy
between the medical professional, other health professionals and
the sellers of patent medicines. It also saw the growth of the
prohibitionist movement. Prohibitionist movements were not
confined to the United States nor to alcohol - patent medicines
and tobacco were also prohibitionist targets (Manderson 1993). </p>

<p> The second phase in the history of Australian drug laws
involved domestic implementation of international agreements
[48](South Australia 1978). The growth of international
conventions led an inexorable, although very gradual expansion of
Australian drug laws to cover cannabis. Australia was not alone
as a nation in feeling the pressure to conform to these
international instruments. However, it was subject to additional
pressures from the British government. The United Kingdom
represented its colonies and dominions at international meetings
and insisted that they comply with international controls.
Following the 1925 Geneva Convention, the Commonwealth was the
first government to succumb to the exhortations of the United
Kingdom. It proscribed the import of cannabis in 1926 through the
Customs (Prohibited Imports) Proclamation and at the same time
banned the export of cannabis. Efforts to bring the States into
line were less successful. Cannabis use in Australia was not a
problem and there appears to have been little domestic agitation
in support of proscription. However, while the response of the
States was slow, it was nevertheless inevitable: It was enough
that international organisations had called for controls and that
the calls had been heeded by the United Kingdom Parliament, whose
attitudes in this as in other matters were of paramount
importance to Commonwealth and State legislators (South Australia
1978, p6). </p>

<p> The first State controls on cannabis use were introduced in
Victoria in the Poisons Act 1928, which penalised the
unauthorised use of Indian hemp and resin. This was followed by
the Dangerous Drugs Act 1934 (SA), the Police Offences Amendment
(Drugs) Act 1935 (NSW), the Health Act 1937 (Qld), a 1950
Proclamation under the Police Offences (Drugs) Act 1928 (WA) and
the Dangerous Drugs Act 1959 (Tas). Australia's attitude to drugs
and drug laws became entrenched at an early stage. Manderson
(1993) has described it very clearly - lack of a domestic problem
(and this particularly applied to cannabis) meant that
legislation was accepted uncritically; no pressure groups existed
to stimulate debate or mount opposition, and the absence of a
drug problem meant that it was impossible to evaluate the costs
and benefits of the prohibitionist model - it was simply assumed
that the model worked effectively: </p>

<p> As the structure of modern drug laws ... took shape, each
brick depending on those beneath it for support and validity, few
remembered or even thought to question why they had ever been
laid. So effective had the gradual process of entrenchment been
that alternative approaches soon became unthinkable. What counted
was the preservation of the laws already in place. If they were
failing, the answer was simple - more of the same' [49](Manderson
1993, p75). </p>

<p> The impact of drug use in the 1960s has been well-documented
and was an international phenomenon. But until this time, drug
use was not viewed as a widespread social problem in Australia -
rather as contained and containable. The consumption of drugs
such as morphine, pethidine, opium and heroin by dependent users
was chiefly confined in Australia to those with a dependence that
was therapeutic in its origins or to minority groups - for
example, very old Chinese members of the community. </p>

<p> In 1960 Australia reported to the Commission on Narcotic
Drugs that some Indian hemp use was occurring in the 'theatrical
world' (quoted in Manderson 1993, p144). But during the 1960s,
the nature and extent of illicit drug use - including the use of
cannabis - changed dramatically. It became more widespread, it
became matter of choice (rather than 'necessity' through
therapeutic dependence), it was embraced by students and youth,
and it was associated with changing moral values and practices,
alienation, and challenges to societal values and the political
order. It brought increasing numbers of otherwise law-abiding
Australians into contact with the criminal law, criminal
penalties and associated stigmatisation. The use of drugs such as
cannabis and heroin came to be regarded both as a symptom of
social malaise and a cause of it. </p>

<p> The third phase in the history of Australian drug laws
commenced during the 1960s. From that time 'the States began
overhauling their drug laws and the Commonwealth became much more
actively involved in the field, both by ratifying new conventions
and by revising the provisions of the Customs Act' ([50]South
Australia 1978, pp35-6). In addition, in response to treaty
obligations, the Commonwealth introduced new federal laws on
drugs - the Narcotic Drugs Act 1967 was the first of these. At
state level, control of recreational drugs was gradually removed
from poisons statutes, whose original purpose was to 'regulate
and control the supply and distribution of pharmaceuticals and
poisons on public health grounds' ([51]Kirby 1992, p315), and
placed into special legislation. Drug laws and drug policies from
this time onwards can be characterised as follows. </p>

<p> First, a law enforcement approach became firmly entrenched at
Commonwealth level with the important role played by Customs,
which had no interest in any medical or public health model of
drug use or supply. </p>

<p> Second, penalties were increased. </p>

<p> Third, there were changes to basic principles of criminal law
- such as reversal of the onus of proof - in order to make
convictions easier ([52]Manderson 1993). </p>

<p> Last, there was a shift in legislative emphasis away from
drug users to drug traffickers. Both Commonwealth and some State
laws distinguished between traffickable quantities of drugs
(including cannabis) and amounts deemed as being less than
traffickable quantities. For the most part, penalties for
cultivation, production and manufacture, possession and use of
cannabis, and possession of drug paraphernalia were substantial
during the 1960s and 1970s. For example, in South Australia the
penalty was $4,000 and/or 10 years imprisonment for knowingly
cultivating cannabis (s5(2)(b)) and $2,000 and/or two years
imprisonment for knowingly being in possession, using or
administering (s5(1)). </p>

<p> Debate about cannabis, research that showed the widespread
nature of cannabis use, alarming law enforcement statistics, the
work of the early Parliamentary and other inquiries, and
difficulties in administering some drug laws, led to the first
legislative changes in the middle to late 1970s. These
distinguished between simple possession of cannabis and other
drugs. The first jurisdiction to change law enforcement practices
and then legislation was the Australian Capital Territory. A
non-enforcement policy in relation to simple cannabis possession
offences was instituted following a number of court cases in
which the police failed to secure convictions because the Public
Health (Prohibited Drugs) Ordinance did not contain a definition
of cannabis. </p>

<p> In 1975, the Ordinance was amended to include a definition of
cannabis. At the same time the maximum penalty for possession of
less than 25g of cannabis was reduced to $100. Some reforms also
occurred in the Northern Territory. Under the Prohibited Drugs
Ordinance 1977 (NT), a first offender was liable to a fine of
$500; while second or third offences of possession were more
heavily penalised, imprisonment was not provided as a sanction.
Further legislative change occurred in the 1980s. The Drugs,
Poisons and Controlled Substances Act 1981 (Vic) contained
slightly less severe penalties for cannabis trafficking than for
trafficking in other illicit drugs. The Drugs, Poisons and
Controlled Substances (Amendment) Act 1983 set the maximum
penalty for possession of less than 50g of cannabis at $500. In
addition, s76 of the Act empowered magistrates to award an
adjourned bond in certain circumstances in the case of an offence
of possession of up to 50g of cannabis. No conviction could be
recorded in the case of a first offender. Section 76 applies only
to cannabis, not to other drugs, and it does not apply to
trafficking offences in respect of any drug. </p>

<p> In South Australia, the Controlled Substances Act was passed
in 1984. As originally formulated, the Act distinguished between
offences involving cannabis or cannabis resin and offences
involving other illicit drugs. The Act proscribed (and still
proscribes) the possession, smoking, consumption, administration
or self-administration, manufacture, sale or supply of drugs of
dependence or prohibited drugs, and the possession of drug
paraphernalia. Under the 1984 Act, the penalty for possession,
smoking or consumption of small quantities of cannabis or
cannabis resin was a maximum of $500. For any other drug of
dependence or prohibited drug the maximum penalty was $2,000
and/or two years imprisonment. Similarly, some distinctions were
made between cannabis and other drugs in respect of trafficking
offences. More significant reforms came in 1986 with the
Controlled Substances Act Amendment Act which provided for an
expiation notice scheme. The expiation notice scheme commenced
operation on 30 April 1987. Section 45a(2) of the Act enables
expiation notices to be issued to adults in certain cases - for
example, when less than 100g of cannabis or less than 20g of
cannabis resin is involved. Notices can be issued in respect of
cultivation that is not for commercial purposes, for smoking or
consumption of cannabis or cannabis resin except in a public or
prescribed place, and for possession of equipment used for the
smoking or consumption of cannabis or the preparation of cannabis
resin. Payment of the expiation fee before the expiration of 60
days from the date of the notice means that no conviction is
recorded against the alleged offender. The fees are $50 for
possession of less than 25g of cannabis and $150 for less than
100g of cannabis. In the case of cannabis resin the expiation
fees are $50 for possession of less than 5g and $150 for amounts
ranging between 5g and less than 20g of resin. Cultivation of 10
plants or less incurs a fine of $150. It should be noted that at
the same time that the cannabis expiation notice system was
introduced, amendments to the Act also substantially increased
penalties for trafficking offences. In addition, amendments to
the Controlled Substances Act in 1990 provide severe penalties
for offences such as sale, supply and administration of
prohibited drugs and drugs of dependence, including cannabis, to
a child. </p>

<p> Although some jurisdictions reformed the law relating to
personal consumption of cannabis, heavier penalties were
introduced for trafficking offences and a scale of trafficking
offences was commonly provided - for example, traffickable,
indictable and commercial quantities. Manderson (1993) puts it
this way: </p>

<p> The emphasis on Mr Big as an evil in his own right allowed a
less severe approach to drug users by removing them from the
centrality of drug laws. The harsh penalties imposed on marijuana
smokers and other users of drugs could be softened without
undermining 'the war on drugs' (p185). </p>

<p> The focus on the Mr Bigs of the drug world has also enabled
legislatures to enact drug laws which give extensive powers of
search and seizure to the police, and which give considerable
powers in relation to the use of listening devices and telephone
taps. While some reforms were put in place in the 1970s and
1980s, the picture that emerges nationally is an uneven one. </p>

<p> The Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), for example,
distinguishes only between cannabis and other drugs in the case
of commercial trafficking. In the case of cannabis the maximum
penalty that can be imposed is $500,000 or 20 years imprisonment,
or both. For commercial trafficking in any other drugs, a life
sentence can be imposed. In New South Wales, possession,
administration and self-administration of prohibited drugs,
including cannabis, are proscribed, as is the possession of
equipment for the administration of prohibited drugs. Personal
consumption offences (involving less than five plants or less
than 25g of cannabis) make an offender liable to a penalty of
$2,000 and/or two years imprisonment. Cultivation, manufacture
and production, and supply are prosecuted on indictment. The
Drugs Misuse Act 1986 (Qld) assigns dangerous drugs to Schedules
under the Act. Drugs like heroin and cocaine appear in the First
Schedule and cannabis sativa is listed in the Second Schedule.
Offences relate to trafficking (s5), supply (s6), production of
dangerous drugs (s8), possession (s9), and possession of drug
paraphernalia (s10). </p>

<p> In addition, penalties vary in the case of aggravated supply
which is defined in s6(2) of the Act as including supply to a
minor, an intellectually handicapped person, and supply in an
educational or correctional institution. While there are
differences in the statutory penalties applicable to First and
Second Schedule drugs, they are minor. </p>

<p> Under the Drugs Misuse Act Amendment Act 1990, the penalty
for unlawful trafficking in cannabis carries a penalty of 20
years imprisonment, while for First Schedule drugs the penalty is
25 years (s5). Possession of cannabis carries a penalty of 15
years imprisonment, or 20 years imprisonment if the quantity
equals or exceeds 500g or 100 plants (s9). The penalty for
possession of drug paraphernalia is imprisonment for two years.
Offenders may be fined in addition to or instead of being
imprisoned (s54) and may be prosecuted summarily for minor
offences (s13). </p>

<p> In 1989 the Australian Capital Territory remodelled its drug
control legislation, and the Drugs of Dependence Ordinance was
introduced with the idea of it being used as a model for all
other jurisdictions. The Act establishes two classes of drug: </p>

<ul>
    <li>prohibited drugs which are subject to special treatment.
        (According to the Act's Explanatory Statement, prohibited
        drugs have no medical use and are harmful for
        recreational purposes); and </li>
    <li>drugs of dependence, which are distinguished from
        prohibited drugs in the Explanatory Statement, in that
        they are said to have a medical use. </li>
</ul>

<p> The Act defines cannabis, cannabis fibre, cannabis oil,
cannabis plants and cannabis resin. Schedule 2 to the Act lists
cannabis, cannabis oil and cannabis resin as prohibited drugs and
defines commercial and traffickable quantities of the drug. In
addition, cannabis is listed in Schedule 5 as a prohibited
plant.1 </p>

<p> The Act makes clear distinctions between personal use
activities and trafficking. It reserves extremely harsh penalties
for the latter and contains deeming provisions. It also makes
distinctions in penalties between cannabis and other prohibited
drugs. Cultivation of prohibited plants, including cannabis, is
an offence (s162(2)), as is cultivation for the purposes of sale
or supply (s162(3)), sale or supply, or possession for sale or
supply (s165(1)). Possession, self-administration and
administration of cannabis are offences under s171. </p>

<p> The harshest penalties are reserved for sale or supply of
commercial quantities of cannabis - life imprisonment (s165), and
cultivation of more than 1,000 plants - life imprisonment
(s162(3)). </p>

<p> In the Northern Territory, the Misuse of Drugs Act 1990
prescribes a penalty of $2,000 or two years imprisonment for
administering cannabis. Possession of less than a traffickable
quantity 'attracts penalties ranging from a $10,000 fine to
imprisonment for 14 years; possession of a commercial quantity
attracts penalties ranging from 14 to 25 years imprisonment. The
penalties for cultivation offences also depend on the quantity
cultivated; commercial quantities carry a 25-year prison term;
traffickable quantities carry a seven-year prison term; and other
cases attract a penalty of a fine of $5,000 or imprisonment for
two years' (Australian Capital Territory 1991, p35). </p>

<p> Like Queensland, Northern Territory legislation creates
separate offences and penalties in respect of supplying illicit
drugs to children. In the Northern Territory, the penalty is 25
years or imprisonment for life (s5). Offences and penalties
relating to illicit drugs are covered by the Poisons Act 1971 and
the Criminal Code in Tasmania, and in Western Australia by the
Misuse of Drugs Act 1981. </p>

<p> In the Australian Capital Territory, changes to the law on
cannabis were introduced by the Drugs of Dependence (Amendment)
Act 1992. These amendments were by no means as far-reaching as
those envisaged by the Legislative Assembly's Select Committee on
HIV, Illegal Drugs and Prostitution (outlined earlier) which
recommended the removal of personal possession offences involving
small amounts of cannabis. However, the amendments do introduce
an expiation notice scheme that applies to both adults and
juveniles (s171A). Under the amendments, a simple cannabis
offence is defined as: * an offence under s162(2) of cultivating
or participating in the cultivation of not more than five
cannabis plants; * an offence under s171(1) of possessing not
more than 25g of cannabis. A police officer is empowered to serve
an offence notice on a person believed to have committed a simple
cannabis offence. If the prescribed penalty of $100 is paid
within 60 days, then the offence is discharged and no conviction
is recorded. The prescribed penalty of $100 is the same as that
previously applying under the Act for possession of small amounts
of cannabis. </p>

<p> Drug law reform is still an active issue for some
Australians. In 1993, interest in drug laws and social policy
resulted in the establishment of an Australian Parliamentary
Group on Drug Law Reform - a group whose membership includes
current and former politicians from different political parties
and a range of jurisdictions, medical practitioners, researchers
and members of the legal profession. Among the short-term goals
being considered by the Committee are the rejection of criminal
sanctions for personal use of drugs and the nationwide adoption
of an expiation scheme model for personal use of cannabis
([53]Van Raay 1993). </p>

<h3>Overseas legislation </h3>

<p> In many European countries, no distinction exists in law
between the so-called 'hard' and 'soft' drugs. In a recent study
of 12 EC nations, only the following nations distinguished
cannabis from other drugs: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Spain distinguishes between 'substances which can cause
        serious damage to health and cannabis and its
        derivatives' ([54]Leroy 1991, p58); </li>
    <li>Ireland distinguishes between 'cannabis and other
        narcotic products' ([55]Leroy 1991, p58); </li>
    <li>The Netherlands distinguishes between 'substances
        presenting an unacceptable risk' ([56]Leroy 1991, p58)
        and cannabis; </li>
    <li>Italian law distinguishes between 'highly addictive drugs
        (Schedules I and III) and drugs with lesser addictive
        properties AND cannabis (Schedules II and IV)' ([57]Leroy
        1991, p58); and </li>
    <li>the United Kingdom Misuse of Drugs Act contains three
        Schedules in which drugs are placed according to their
        level of risk. Cannabis, some opiates, barbiturates and
        some amphetamines are classified as Schedule B drugs. </li>
</ul>

<p> Drug use (involving both 'hard' and 'soft' drugs) is not
proscribed in Spain, Ireland, Italy or The Netherlands.
Possession for personal use is prohibited in Spain, Ireland,
Italy and The Netherlands, but lesser penalties are provided when
possession involves cannabis. In the case of trafficking
offences, laws in Spain, Ireland, Italy and The Netherlands
impose less severe penalties when trafficking involves cannabis. </p>

<p> In the United States, the federal Controlled Substances Act
lists cannabis in Schedule 1 - where drugs with a high dependency
potential and no accepted medical use are located. Possession of
a controlled drug attracts a lighter penalty than does
trafficking. Even so, penalties for possession are substantial -
a first offender being liable to up to one year's imprisonment
and a fine of between $1,000 and $5,000. </p>

<p> During the 1970s, at State level, 11 States adopted a civil
penalty model for possession of small amounts of cannabis for
personal use. Oregon was the first State to introduce civil
penalty laws in 1973. In general, the maximum penalty for
possession of small quantities of cannabis for personal use in
the 'decriminalised' states is $100. Exceptions are Mississippi
($250) and Nebraska ($200). </p>

<p> Efforts to recriminalise these activities have been described
as 'concerted' ([58]Reuter 1992), with William Bennett, the
National Drug Control Director, personally appearing before a
number of state legislatures to argue for recriminalisation. In
1990, Alaska reintroduced criminal penalties for possession of
small amounts of cannabis. </p>

<p> In Canada, the federal Narcotic Control Act 1961 has remained
largely unaltered to this day. There are six basic offences under
the Act. These are: simple possession, trafficking, possession
for trafficking, cultivation of opium or cannabis, import or
export of scheduled drugs, and prescription shopping ([59]Solomon
1988). According to Solomon, apart from the offence of
cultivation, the Act does not differentiate between scheduled
drugs. Cannabis possession can be tried summarily or on
indictment. In the case of simple possession offences, summary
conviction of a first offence renders the offender liable to a
fine of $1,000 and six months imprisonment. In the case of a
subsequent offence, summarily prosecuted, the penalty is $2,000
and one year's jail. On indictment, an offender is liable to
seven year's imprisonment. </p>

<p> The Canadian Government did not respond positively to the Le
Dain Commission recommendation that possession of cannabis no
longer be a criminal offence. However, in 1972 the Criminal Law
Amendment Act gave judges a discretion to direct that an offender
be discharged absolutely or on probation. It appears that law
enforcement officers rarely proceed on indictment in the case of
possession offences, and that 'judges rarely impose the maximum
sentence or anything close to it in cannabis cases' ([60]Solomon
1988, p126). </p>

<p> In this section, particular attention is devoted to the laws
and enforcement practices of The Netherlands and the United
Kingdom. Illicit drug laws in both countries have been influenced
by existence of international conventions. Initially both
countries enacted drug laws in the absence of a domestic drug
problem. </p>

<p> In The Netherlands illicit drug laws were first introduced in
the Opium Act 1919. Apart from amending legislation in 1928, drug
laws remained unchanged until the present Opium Act was passed in
1976. Current Dutch attitudes towards illicit drug use -
manifested in the Prosecution Guidelines that govern the
enforcement of the Act - are said to arise from a number of
factors peculiar to Dutch society and history. First, realism and
pragmatism. Second, a belief in social pluralism. Third, an
ideology of normalisation in which 'illicit drugs are seen as a
limited and manageable social problem rather than an alien threat
forced on an otherwise innocent society' ([61]Leuw 1991, p2).
Fourth, is the context of the criminal law itself. Dutch writers
stress that the criminal law is not perceived as enforcing social
morality but rather as 'an instrument of social control, whose
results must be assessed from case to case' ([62]Ruter 1988, p6).
</p>

<p> They further report that the criminal law has a minor role in
The Netherlands. Until the introduction of the Opium Act 1976,
drug offences in The Netherlands appear to have been actively
prosecuted and severely sanctioned. According to [63]van de
Wijngaart (1991), cannabis appeared in The Netherlands in the
1950s; harsh sentences were handed down, for example - 12 months
imprisonment for minor cannabis offences; and media coverage was
sensationalist. </p>

<p> However, despite sentencing practices, an increase in
cannabis use was reported, especially among Dutch youth. During
the 1960s pressure for law reform increased and culminated in
1976 with new opium legislation. The present Opium Act
distinguishes between drugs posing unacceptable risks such as
heroin, cocaine, LSD and cannabis oil, and hemp products -
marijuana and cannabis resin.2 It also decreased penalties for
possession of drugs for personal use, but increased penalties for
trafficking in hard drugs. Overlying the offences and penalties
in the Opium Act are police and prosecution guidelines which have
produced a situation that some commentators have described as de
facto decriminalisation. These guidelines relate to the
'intensity of police custody and preventive detention,
prosecutorial alternatives (dismissal, fine, or prosecution) and
penalties involving violations of the Opium Act, and were
established by the Procurators-General in 1976' (Marshall et al.
1990, p395). The guidelines are made possible by the Expediency
Principle set out in Articles 167 and 242 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure. This principle operates where the public good is
served by refraining from prosecution. It can operate for both
individual offenders and categories of offence. In the case of
the Opium Act, a number of activities are designated as 'not for
prosecution, detection or arrest'. These include: </p>

<ul>
    <li>the sale of less than 30g of hemp products; and </li>
    <li>dealing in, possessing or cultivating up to 30g of
        cannabis. </li>
</ul>

<p> High priority is given under the guidelines to the detection
and prosecution of traffickers. In Britain, like Australia and
The Netherlands, drug laws were in existence long before the
existence of a widespread domestic drug problem. During World War
I concerns about drug taking by soldiers led to the issuing of
Army Council orders forbidding the supply of cocaine, heroin,
Indian hemp, morphine, and other substances to soldiers except by
medical practitioners. </p>

<p> The existence of international conventions resulted in the
enactment of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1920 - as a signatory of the
Treaty of Versailles, Britain undertook to incorporate the 1912
Hague Convention into domestic law. Even at this early stage
penalties were severe. Illegal possession of listed drugs could
result in a 200 fine or six months imprisonment, or both.
Penalties were higher for repeat offenders. The Dangerous Drugs
Amendment Act 1923 raised these penalties. However, '... at most
the total annual convictions and known addicts numbered only a
few hundred until the second half of the twentieth century'
([64]Howitt 1990-91, p357). </p>

<p> The present Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 creates different
classes of drugs according to their potential for harm and
penalises activities such as possession and cultivation. Cannabis
and cannabis resin are Class B drugs and, while subject to lesser
penalties than Class A drugs, still carry substantial penalties.
For example, summary prosecution for an offence of possession of
a Class B drug can result in three months imprisonment and/or a
500 fine. If the offender is convicted on indictment the
maximum penalty is five years jail or a fine, or both.
Cultivation of a Class A, B or C drug exposes the offender to a
penalty of six months incarceration and/or a 2000 fine on
summary conviction, and up to 14 years imprisonment or a fine, or
both, if convicted on indictment ([65]Fortson 1992). Like The
Netherlands and Australia, the most substantial penalties are
available for drug trafficking. While imprisonment is available
as a sanction for cannabis possession in Great Britain, it
appears that custodial sentences are not imposed for possession
of cannabis for personal use. In addition, enforcement of the
Misuse of Drugs Act may vary considerably throughout the nation,
especially where cannabis is involved: In an urban area if a
policeman finds a young person in possession of a few grammes of
cannabis he may deal with the matter informally or offer a
caution, and no official record will be made. In a country town
possession of exactly the same quantity of the drug might lead to
prosecution, a fine, and headlines in the local newspaper'
([66]Royal College of Psychiatrists 1987, p125). </p>

<p> As in Australia, drug law reform continues to be an issue in
Europe. Some reforms to European drug laws have been
foreshadowed. [67]Wodak (1993) reports that: the lead has come
from municipal authorities. Thirteen cities in Europe have signed
a document known as the Frankfort [sic] Declaration which commits
these municipal authorities to a programme of drug policy reform.
Thirty-three other cities have signed an expression of interest
and are considering their position. In November, this Declaration
will be signed by the Mayor of Baltimore in the United States
(p7). </p>

<p> In Italy, voters were asked in a referendum held on 18 April
1993 whether drug users should be imprisoned. The referendum was
the result of changes to drug laws in 1990 which enabled courts
to imprison drug users found guilty of possession of more than
the 'average daily dose' of a drug (dose media giornaliera)
(UNICRI, pers comm). As a consequence of the referendum, such
drug users are now liable only to administrative sanctions such
as a fine or the confiscation of their driver's licence. Drug
traffickers are still liable to imprisonment. </p>

<h3>Current international treaties </h3>

<p> The international treaties relating to cannabis are the
Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961 as amended by the 1972
Protocol, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances 1971 and the
1988 UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances (Vienna Convention). The Convention on
Psychotropic Substances includes THC, the psychoactive
constituent of cannabis. As THC is rarely extracted for illicit
drug use ([68]Fox &amp; Mathews 1992), no further attention will
be devoted to it. </p>

<p> The Single Convention consolidated a number of previous
Conventions on narcotic drugs and amalgamated a number of
monitoring organisations to create the International Narcotics
Control Board. Australia ratified the Single Convention on 1
December 1967. Cannabis is not a narcotic drug, but is classified
as such for the purposes of the Single Convention. </p>

<p> This classification has been important in shaping public and
political perceptions - that cannabis is dangerous to personal
health and community safety. Narcotic drugs are listed in
Schedules to the Convention. Schedule I contains the major
opioids, as well as cocaine and cannabis. Schedules II and III
contain less powerful drugs such as codeine. Schedule IV contains
drugs regarded as having particularly dangerous properties.
Cannabis, as well as drugs like heroin, is part of Schedule IV.
Articles 36, 4 and 2(5) of the Single Convention are of
particular importance for the purposes of this report. Article
36(1) of the Convention provides that, 'subject to its
constitutional limitations', each Party shall adopt measures to
ensure that activities such as manufacture, possession,
distribution, sale, transport, importation and exportation of
drugs 'contrary to the provisions of this Convention ... shall be
punishable offences when committed intentionally ....'. </p>

<p> In addition, Article 4 provides that: (c) Subject to the
provisions of this Convention, [Parties are] to limit exclusively
to medical and scientific purposes the production, manufacture,
export, import, distribution of, trade in, use and possession of
drugs. Cannabis is also located in Schedule IV of the Convention.
Article 2(5) requires that: (a) A Party shall adopt any special
measures of control which in its opinion are necessary having
regard to the particularly dangerous properties of a drug so
included; and (b) A Party shall, if in its opinion the prevailing
conditions in its country render it the most appropriate means of
protecting the public health and welfare, prohibit the
production, manufacture, export and import of, trade in,
possession or use of any such drug except for amounts which may
be necessary for medical and scientific research only, including
clinical trials herewith to be conducted under or subject to the
direct supervision of the Party. </p>

<p> It must be emphasised, however, that Article 2(5) is not
mandatory. Rather, special measures of control can be imposed if,
in the opinion of the Party, they are 'necessary' or
'appropriate'. Under the Single Convention Parties are required
to criminalise activities relating to trafficking, subject to
their constitutional limitations. In the past, however, questions
have also arisen about the need for Parties to criminalise
activities associated with personal use and possession. The
Williams Royal Commission concluded that to remove prohibitions
against cannabis would depart from the spirit and intention of
the Convention. In Canada, the Le Dain Commission regarded
possession for personal use as falling within the ambit of the
Convention. Woltring (1990) also takes this view on the grounds
that 'possession could relate to both possession for trafficking
or possession for personal consumption' (p20). </p>

<p> However, there is authority (e.g. [69]United States 1972,
[70]Noll 1977, [71]South Australia 1978) that 'the Convention
does not require signatories to make either use or possession for
personal use punishable offences, although the creation or
retention of such offences would be consistent with the treaty.
This is because &quot;use&quot; is not specifically covered by
Article 26 and the term &quot;possession&quot; in that Article
and elsewhere can be read as confined to possession for the
purpose of dealing' ([72]South Australia 1978, p46). </p>

<p> Further, the requirement that Parties limit the use of drugs
to medical and scientific purposes does not require them to
'attain that goal by providing penal sanctions for unauthorized
&quot;use&quot; or &quot;personal consumption&quot; of drugs'
([73]Noll 1977, p44). In the view of the Shafer Commission,
measures such as 'an educational program and similar approaches
designed to discourage use' could be employed (1972, p167). While
the International Narcotics Control Board appears to be equivocal
about this interpretation of the Convention in respect of
personal possession, it does not appear to condemn it, merely
remarking in relation to the Single Convention, that Parties: may
take the view that they are not required to establish such
activities as criminal offences under law. The basis for this
view appears to be that, since obligations relating to penal
provisions appear among articles relating to illicit traffic, the
obligations only apply to cultivation, purchase or possession for
the purpose of illicit trafficking (1992, p6). The 1972 Protocol
provides for measures to treat and rehabilitate drug users in
addition, or as an alternative to, punishment. </p>

<p> It also contains provisions relating to the International
Narcotics Control Board, and international narcotics trafficking.
Australia ratified the Protocol on 22 November 1972. Australia's
international treaty obligations must now be read taking the 1988
Vienna Convention into account. Australia ratified the Convention
without reservations on 16 November 1992. While the Single
Convention attempts to contain the supply of illicit drugs by
limiting the use of scheduled drugs to medical and scientific
purposes, the Vienna Convention is directed particularly at drug
trafficking and is designed to provide a system of international
cooperation to counter trafficking activities. It must be read
subject to the Single Convention. The Vienna Convention was made
against a background of international horse-trading, and was
ratified domestically in the face of a measure of opposition. </p>

<p> An International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Traffic
in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances was convened in
1987. At the Conference there was debate between the consumer,
producer and transit states about the content of the treaty.
Consumer nations felt that the Convention should target the
movement of illicit drugs between states, while producer
countries argued that the Convention needed to address drug
consumption - in other words, create obligations for drug-using
nations. As a result, provisions relating to domestic drug
consumption are included in the Convention. </p>

<p> Nevertheless, the major thrust of the Convention is towards
trafficking and international cooperation in matters such as
extradition, mutual legal assistance, and transfer of
proceedings. Paragraph 1 of Article 3 relating to trafficking
offences states that 'Each Party shall adopt such measures as may
be necessary to establish [them] as criminal offences under its
domestic law, when committed intentionally'. Paragraph 2 of
Article 3 deals with cultivation, possession or purchase for
personal use. </p>

<p> In relation to the establishment of criminal offences its
wording is different to and more qualified than that in paragraph
1. It states: </p>

<p> Subject to its constitutional principles and the basic
concepts of its legal system, each Party shall adopt such
measures as may be necessary to establish as a criminal offence
under its domestic law, when committed intentionally, the
possession, purchase or cultivation of narcotic drugs or
psychotropic substances for personal consumption contrary to the
provisions of the 1961 Convention, the 1961 Convention as amended
or the 1971 Convention. </p>

<p> In addition, paragraph 4(d) of Article 3 provides that: The
Parties may provide, either as an alternative to conviction or
punishment, or in addition to conviction or punishment of an
offence established in accordance with paragraph 2 of this
article, measures for the treatment, education, aftercare,
rehabilitation or social reintegration of the offender. Not
surprisingly, there are a number of different interpretations
that can be placed on the provisions of the Vienna Convention as
they relate to personal consumption activities. </p>

<p> The International Narcotics Control Board states that the
1988 Vienna Convention requires criminal offences to be
established in relation to possession, purchase or cultivation
for personal use. However, it adds: None of the conventions
requires a party to convict or punish drug abusers who commit
such offences even when they have been established as punishable
offences. The party may choose to deal with drug abusers through
alternative non-penal measures involving treatment, education,
after-care, rehabilitation or social reintegration
([74]International Narcotics Control Board 1992, p4). </p>

<p> Other commentators take the view that the Vienna Convention
is a trafficking convention and that, with respect to personal
use activities, a Party may choose not to retain or introduce
criminal offences for those activities if such an approach does
not accord with matters such as 'the basic concepts of its legal
system'. What then are the implications of the Single Convention,
the 1972 Protocol and the 1988 Vienna Convention for public
policy options relating to cannabis? </p>

<h3>Total Prohibition </h3>

<p> Total prohibition is the policy pursued by many of the
Parties to the Conventions - including the Australian
jurisdictions of Queensland, Northern Territory, Victoria,
Western Australia and Tasmania. </p>

<p> Some writers describe the Single Convention as prohibitionist
in nature ([75]Fox &amp; Mathews 1992); others as 'regulatory as
opposed to merely prohibitionist' ([76]Woltring 1990, p19).
Whatever the case, extremely stringent measures can be employed
by the Parties. In both the Single Convention and the Vienna
Convention provisions exist that enable the Parties to 'adopt
more strict or severe measures than those provided for by the
convention if, in [their] opinion, such measures are desirable or
necessary to prevent or suppress illicit trafficking'
([77]International Narcotics Control Board 1992, p4). Civil
penalty option. As described earlier, this policy option removes
criminal penalties for personal use activities such as possession
and instead imposes civil penalties - most commonly fines.
Australia ratified the Vienna Convention after consultations with
the States to ensure that legislation in all jurisdictions
conformed with treaty obligations. </p>

<p> While some commentators ([78]Fox &amp; Mathews 1992) argue
that civil penalties such as those provided in the South
Australian legislation represent a minor breach of international
treaty obligations, this does not appear to be the view of the
Commonwealth or of other commentators. There appear to be no
international law impediments to the civil penalty approach. </p>

<h3>Partial prohibition. </h3>

<p> As described by the [79]Sackville Royal Commission (South
Australia 1978), partial prohibition distinguishes between
trafficking in cannabis and activities associated with personal
use such as possession. Partial prohibition would remove all
penalties, both civil and criminal, in respect of personal use
and possession activities. These activities would no longer be
criminal offences. The removal of offences and penalties for
personal use and possession activities can be seen as
inconsistent with the conventions. Such a conclusion might be
reached on an interpretation of the Single Convention along the
lines suggested by [80]Woltring (1990), and of the Vienna
Convention. </p>

<p> It can also be argued that partial prohibition can be
accommodated under the Conventions. The Sackville Royal
Commission (1979, p311) took this view in regard to the Single
Convention - on the basis that the Convention did not encompass
personal use and possession activities. Partial prohibition could
be reconciled with the Vienna Convention on the basis of two
interpretations. For those who take the view that the Vienna
Convention is a trafficking convention and that there is no
requirement that personal use and possession activities be
criminalised, there is no obstacle to partial prohibition. It
could also be argued that partial prohibition could encompass an
option where a criminal offence existed for personal use and
possession activities, but no criminal or civil penalties were
provided. The existence of a criminal offence would be a signal
of society's disapproval of cannabis use. Treatment, education,
rehabilitation or social reintegration could be provided instead
of criminal or civil penalties, it being up to State Parties to
determine whether these measures are provided administratively or
by statute. </p>

<h3>Regulatory option </h3>

<p> Regulatory options might include regulated commercial sale or
a government monopoly. In 1979 the Sackville Royal Commission
took the view that regulation could not be accommodated under the
Single Convention (p311). The advent of the AIDS epidemic and
concern about injecting drug use and disease transmission may
have contributed to recent interpretations of treaty obligations
that differ from this view. [81]Woltring (1990) states that it is
open to Parties, within the context of 'medical or scientific
purpose', to: </p>

<ul>
    <li>provide for the cultivation of cannabis by a government
        agency; </li>
    <li>provide for the manufacture of cannabis by a government
        agency or private concern under government licence; </li>
    <li>trade in and distribute cannabis through a government
        agency or private enterprise under government licence; </li>
    <li>'supply or dispense drugs to drug abusers or
        AIDS/Hepatitis B risk users under appropriate programs'
        (p20). </li>
</ul>

<p> He goes on to remark that 'While any Party could adopt such
options on the basis that they serve the medical or therapeutic
objective of treating drug addiction or abuse, the options could
not be adopted if their ultimate purpose was to enable
recreational use as distinct from medical or therapeutic use'
(p20). </p>

<p> Under [82]Woltring's model, regulation could co-exist with
treaty obligations, but only to a limited extent - within a
medical model. Supply or dispensation of drugs to drug users for
medical purposes is considerably easier to reconcile with treaty
obligations in the context of injecting drug use than in relation
to cannabis. It might be argued that high THC content of illicit
cannabis represented a health risk to users 3, that could be
overcome through regulated supply, or that separation of drug
markets would make it less likely that cannabis users would be
exposed to and thus move on to more dangerous drug use involving
injecting drugs. However, these propositions would be unlikely to
convince most governments or commentators. </p>

<h3>Free availability. </h3>

<p> This policy option could not be accommodated under the
Conventions and would place Australia in breach of its treaty
obligations. This discussion of international instruments
suggests that Australia has some flexibility in considering and
implementing policy options in the context of treaty obligations.
However, for some options it might be thought necessary to seek
amendments to the Conventions or, indeed, denounce them.4 </p>

<p> An important question to be answered is whether Australian
drug laws, so long dominated and directed by influences beyond
our shores, and so little attuned to Australia's own
circumstances, should continue to be determined externally. As
cautious an inquiry as the Williams Royal Commission commented,
in relation to the Single Convention, that the spirit and
intention of the treaty was 'a secondary matter in the sense that
Australia must first decide what is the correct domestic policy
and then shape its international course accordingly' (1980,
pC263). </p>

<h1><a name="OLE_LINK1">FIVE LEGISLATIVE OPTIONS </a></h1>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.GIF"><br>
</p>

<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p> Many legislative options are available for cannabis and, as
indicated in [1]Chapter 2, much confusion exists in the
terminology used to describe them. In this chapter, we outline
the five broad options available to Australian decision-makers,
namely: </p>

<ul>
    <li>total prohibition; </li>
    <li>prohibition with civil penalties for minor offences; </li>
    <li>partial prohibition; </li>
    <li>regulation; and </li>
    <li>free availability. </li>
</ul>

<p> Some readers will be aware that this is the classification
used by the South Australian Royal Commission into the
Non-Medical Use of Drugs (the Sackville Commission) which
reported in 1978. We have adopted their approach as it is, in our
view, both precise and comprehensive. It avoids the semantic
problems that often cause much confusion in debates about drug
policies. In particular, it avoids the terms 'decriminalisation'
and 'legalisation', terms which have different meanings for
different authorities. </p>

<p> The five options listed capture all the approaches which
people have in mind when they refer to 'decriminalisation' and
'legalisation', as well as other options which these two words
may or may not encompass. The five legislative options are
discussed in turn. We follow a consistent format to facilitate
comparisons between them. First we describe the option; an
example of it in operation follows (or, if there is no such
example, we describe what it would look like if the option were
implemented); we then outline the rationales which are given or
are imputable (both philosophical and pragmatic rationales are
covered); discuss the outcomes and impacts (observed or likely)
flowing from its implementation; and in conclusion we evaluate
the appropriateness of the option. </p>

<h2>Option 1: Total prohibition </h2>

<p> Under the system of total prohibition the use, possession,
cultivation, importation, sale and distribution of any amount of
cannabis are treated as criminal offences. People importing or
dealing in cannabis may be liable to severe sanctions, and those
using or found in possession of the drug are subject to arrest
and prosecution. If convicted, they acquire a criminal record and
may be subject to a variety of sanctions including imprisonment. </p>

<p> 'Total prohibition' can take a number of forms. For example,
although both The Netherlands and the United States have
legislation that can be described as total prohibition, the
differences in the strategies used to enforce, or not enforce,
the legislation mean that the drug policies in these two nations
are dramatically different. This section will outline the
background and rationale of American and Dutch drug policies, and
will evaluate them in light of the goals outlined in [2]Chapter
2. </p>

<h3>PART A: THE UNITED STATES: </h3>

<h4>Total legislative and administrative prohibition: Drug law
and policy in the United States </h4>

<p> This examination of drug policy will focus on the US Federal
Government's strategy of total prohibition.5 </p>

<p> The Federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA) groups drugs into
five categories. These categories are said to be based on the
drugs' perceived potential for abuse, accepted medical use and
propensity to create physiological and psychological dependency,
for users (Inciardi 1990). The US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA)
is responsible for classifying drugs and for periodically
updating classifications. Cannabis is listed in Schedule 1 of the
classification scheme. Schedule 1 drugs are seen to have a high
potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in the
United States and no acceptable safe level of use under medical
supervision. </p>

<p> Violations of the CSA are separated into two offence
categories: first, the possession of controlled substances; and,
secondly, the manufacture, delivery or sale of controlled
substances. All first possession offences carry a penalty of up
to one year's incarceration and a fine of $1,000 to $5,000.
Second offences are punishable by more severe sanctions. The
basic penalty for the manufacture, delivery or sale of less than
50kg of marijuana, 100 or more marijuana plants, less than 10kg
of cannabis resin (hashish) or less than one kilogram of cannabis
oil is punishment by up to five years incarceration and/or a
$250,000 fine. Second or subsequent offences are punishable by up
to 10 years incarceration and/or a $500,000 fine. The penalty for
the manufacture, sale or delivery of between 50kg and 100kg of
marijuana is a sentence of up to 20 years imprisonment and/or a
fine of up to $1 million. Second or subsequent violations of
manufacture/delivery/sale provisions are punishable by up to 30
years imprisonment and/or up to $2 million in fines for
individuals and $30 million for others. </p>

<p> The CSA also provides for other sanctions against people who
profit from drug dealing. An offender can be required to forfeit
to the state all controlled substances, raw materials or
equipment used to manufacture, import or export controlled
substances, all conveyances used to transport controlled
substances, all money and property gained through contravening
the CSA, and all property used to facilitate violations of the
CSA. The proceeds of forfeiture are used to fund drug law
enforcement. </p>

<p> Drug policy in the US has, in part, been conceptualised in
the economic terms of supply and demand. Primarily the focus has
been on reducing the supply of illegal drugs, including cannabis,
through such measures as destroying crops at the source or
interdicting supplies as they enter the US. Cannabis crops, for
example, may be spotted from the air by helicopter, sprayed with
herbicide or eradicated by ground teams. Destroying cannabis
crops in other countries, particularly South American, and
encouraging other governments to participate in law enforcement
efforts, have formed an important part of the American drug
strategy of reducing the supply of drugs. </p>

<p> Central to the US Government's policy on reducing demand is
the idea of creating a climate of intolerance towards all drug
use through concepts such as 'user accountability' and 'zero
tolerance'. 'User accountability' is the idea that individual
users should be made to recognise that their drug use, no matter
how minor it may appear to be, is part of a drug problem that
eventually results in the death of some users ([3]Wardlaw 1992).
The notion of 'zero tolerance' holds that no drug offence should
be allowed any degree of tolerance and makes little distinction
in terms of culpability between the different scales of drug
offences ([4]US Bureau of Justice Statistics 1992). </p>

<h3>Rationales </h3>

<h4>Pragmatic rationales </h4>

<p> The eradication of all illicit drug use is the central aim of
US drug policy and it is thought that prohibition is the most
effective means of reaching this goal. Cannabis use is seen as a
part of a larger drug problem. Prohibition is thought to decrease
cannabis usage in the following ways: </p>

<ul>
    <li>prohibition discourages people from experimenting with
        drugs and </li>
    <li>deters people convicted of drug offences from
        re-offending; and </li>
    <li>prohibition causes the price of illicit drugs to
        increase, making them more difficult to obtain. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Philosophical rationales </h4>

<p> Drug policy in the US is based on a deeply held belief that
all illicit drug use is extremely harmful, both in terms of the
dangers that it poses to users and in terms of the dangers that
it poses to the social fabric of American society. There is very
little distinction made between cannabis and other drugs. In
1971, President Richard Nixon declared that drug abuse was
'public enemy number one' ([5]Wijingaart 1991, p95) and, more
recently, one commentator has claimed that: Drug use in America
today is a major threat to our health, productivity, and quality
of life (Du Pont 1984: xvi, [6]cited in Wijingaart 1991, p101). </p>

<p> Section 801 of the Federal Controlled Substances Act states
that: The illegal importation, manufacture, distribution, and
possession and improper use of controlled substances have a
substantial and detrimental effect on the health and general
welfare of the American people. </p>

<p> In the US, official analysis of the social problems
associated with drug use has been narrow, and American policy
makers have tended to see drugs themselves as the central source
of all the ills associated with drug use in that country.
Analyses of the social context of drug taking or of the
relationship between drug taking and poverty have apparently had
little impact on the development of drug policy. </p>

<p> Central to the official American idea of 'harm' caused by
drugs is that all drugs are 'addictive', and that any
experimentation with drugs will inevitably result in dependency.
Associated with the fear of dependence is the fear, in many cases
unrealistic, of the effect that drug use has on individuals.
Although not accepting this characterisation, James Inciardi has
described the stereotype of the American drug user in the
following terms: 'Dope fiends', as they were called, were
sex-crazed maniacs, degenerate criminals, and members of the
'living dead'. 'Narcotics', including marijuana and cocaine ...
destroyed morality, addicts were sexually violent and criminally
aggressive, they were weak and ineffective members of society;
addiction was contagious since users had a mania for perpetuating
the social anathema of drug taking; and finally, once addicted,
the user entered into a lifetime of slavery to drugs ([7]Inciardi
1986, p100). </p>

<p> It has been claimed that those debating drugs policy in the
US have blurred the distinction between the effects of drug use
and the effects of the prohibition of drug use ([8]Wardlaw 1992).
Drug use is therefore thought to be inextricably linked to
violent crime, users are conceptualised as criminals, and policy
towards any level of drug use is punitive and coercive. This
philosophy of drug use is evident in the rhetorical language of
US policy makers who talk about 'zero tolerance' and who have
called their drug strategy a 'war on drugs'. </p>

<h4>Outcomes </h4>

<p> Although the price of cannabis has increased with the
policies of prohibition, the increase has not had the intended
effect of significantly reducing cannabis consumption. Despite
half a century of total prohibition, cannabis is still the most
widely used of illicit drugs in the US. Household surveys of drug
use conducted by the National Institute on Drug Abuse have found
that almost 68 million people in the US reported that they had
used cannabis, including 9.7 million who reported that they had
used it in the past month. In other words, some 33 per cent of
the household population aged 12 years or older reported they had
used marijuana in their lifetimes and 5 per cent reported having
used the drug in the past month. (NIDA, National Household Survey
on Drug Abuse: Population estimates 1991; cited in [9]US Bureau
of Justice Statistics 1992, p26). </p>

<p> It could be concluded that the prohibition of cannabis has
not been successful in eradicating or even significantly
decreasing cannabis use in the United States. On the other hand,
it could be argued that the policy has prevented an even higher
level of use occurring. From 1981 to 1987, 5.3 million kilograms
of marijuana were seized, however Customs, Coast Guard and the
DEA believe that they seized only 10 per cent of the marijuana
entering the country ([10]Inciardi &amp; McBride 1990, p284).
Despite the fluctuations in price that law enforcement efforts
may cause to cannabis markets from time to time, demand for
cannabis has, it is claimed, remained relatively unchanged.
Nadelmann has argued that 'the greatest beneficiaries of the drug
laws are organised and unorganised drug traffickers. The
criminalisation of the drug market effectively imposes a 'value
added tax' ([11]Nadelmann 1991). </p>

<p> The law enforcement program associated with prohibition has
also been costly, both in financial and social terms. In 1986 the
Federal expenditure on cannabis enforcement was estimated to be
around $800 million, and it is thought to have significantly
increased since then (Kleiman 1986). This figure does not include
state and local expenditures on law enforcement and criminal
justice. Every year there are 350,000 arrests for cannabis
possession alone, making this the third most common cause of
arrest in the US ([12]Kleiman 1992, pp267-8). </p>

<p> The social costs of the law enforcement program are also
high. [13]Kleiman (1992) claims that the majority of people who
are arrested for buying and using cannabis rarely do anything
else that might bring them to the attention of the criminal
justice system and that, for many users, being subject to arrest
and criminal justice processing is the most substantial risk of
using cannabis. The consequence of this is that large numbers of
people acquire criminal records and are stigmatised for what many
would see as relatively minor offences. </p>

<p> Kleiman also argues that the prohibition of cannabis
undermines the symbolic value of the criminal law. Since arrest
is the most immediate and frequent part of the punishment process
for all crimes, it is important that arrest should retain its
social meaning both as involving some substantial risk of further
punishment (to maintain its deterrent value) and as resulting
from the doing of some substantial harm (to maintain its moral
force). The fact that simple possession of marijuana is the third
most common cause of arrest puts strain on both of these symbolic
links. This contribution to the devaluation of arrest as a
sanction ought to be counted as a sizeable cost of current
marijuana laws ([14]Kleiman 1992, p268). </p>

<p> It has also been claimed by some opponents of the 'war on
drugs' that one by product of prohibition is the abuse of civil
liberties (e.g. [15]Boaz 1990). In the United States, property
can be seized if a police officer alleges that a small amount of
a controlled substance, including cannabis, is found in the
property. Forfeiture can occur without indictment or conviction
of the owner of the property, a practice that Boaz claims is a
violation of civil rights. </p>

<p> The prohibition of cannabis has also had a number of
unintended consequences. It is argued that the patterns of
cannabis use have become more dangerous and the amount of
violence associated with the cannabis market has increased.
First, it is argued that the successful interdiction of cannabis
entering the US from overseas has resulted in increased
cultivation and production of cannabis within the country.
Nadelmann has claimed that the US has emerged as one of the
world's leading producers of cannabis ([16]Nadelmann 1991, p787).
He also argues that international drug traffickers have
redirected their attention from cannabis to cocaine, resulting in
a 'glut of increasingly potent cocaine being available and a
shortage of comparatively benign marijuana' ([17]Nadelmann 1991,
p787). </p>

<p> It is also argued that prohibition has caused an increase in
the crime and violence associated with cannabis markets and an
increase in the content of THC (the major psychoactive
ingredient) of cannabis. When the majority of cannabis used was
imported from other countries, the distribution system for
cannabis was much smaller. The production of cannabis within the
US, it is argued, leads to more small and medium producers with a
wider, more competitive and possibly more violent distribution
system (Kleiman 1986; [18]Wardlaw 1992). Domestic enforcement
has, it is argued, resulted in more technology-intensive methods
of cultivation and an increase in the potency of cannabis
([19]Reuter 1987). The fact that the sale of water pipes for
smoking cannabis is illegal means that users more often consume
cannabis in cigarette papers, which is the form of consumption
most damaging to their lungs (Reuter 1987). </p>

<p> Given the costs of this form of prohibition, and its relative
lack of success, it is perhaps surprising that the US drug
strategy enjoys widespread support from the American people. In
Gallup surveys conducted from 1969 to 1985, people were asked:
'do you think the use of marijuana should be made legal or not?'.
In 1985, 23 per cent of respondents were in favour, 73 per cent
opposed and 4 per cent expressed no opinion ([20]Inciardi &amp;
McBride 1990, p295). In October 1989 a Time/CNN poll found that
79 per cent of the population would be willing to pay higher
taxes if the money were used for fighting the 'war on drugs'
(Inciardi &amp; McBride 1990, p295). The 'war on drugs' is
supported by liberal and conservative politicians alike, public
debate on drug strategy is rare, and discussion of the
appropriateness of drug strategy has been described as 'a parlour
sport for intellectuals' rather than a subject of general public
concern. </p>

<p> As noted above, during the 1970s a number of US states
removed the penal penalties for possession of small amounts of
cannabis for personal use (a process referred to in the USA as
'decriminalisation'), but this move towards a more liberal
approach was subsequently abandoned. Little information is
available on the basis of the policy reversal, referred to as
'recriminalisation'. Apparently the decisions were made not on
the basis of factual research into the impact of
decriminalisation, but rather on ideological grounds.
Opportunities were available for research comparing the
experiences of the various states, but apparently such research
was not undertaken, leaving policy to be made without a firm
information base.6 </p>

<h4>CONCLUSION - THE USA APPROACH </h4>

<p> The US drug policy does not seem to have met many of the
policy goals identified in the early part of this report. </p>

<p> First, cannabis policy has not been separated from that of
other drugs. Policy makers see only the larger 'drug problem' and
have not recognised the need to have different policies for
different drugs. </p>

<p> Secondly, in the USA the arguments for the total prohibition
of all drugs are highly emotive; arguments about the consequences
of drug use have not been separated from arguments about morals.
Consequently, this has led to the idea that is implicit in much
US drug policy, that all illicit drugs and consequently all drug
users are inherently criminal and even evil. The
conceptualisation of the drug problem in such uncompromising,
black and white terms means that there is little room to make
exceptions for arguably 'soft' drugs such as cannabis. </p>

<p> Thirdly, the goals of the 'war on drugs' are not realistic.
Kleiman has argued that US drug policy amounts to a 'holy war'
against drugs, and as such it is not surprising that the policy
goals are far from realistic ([21]Kleiman 1992). Those creating
and implementing the US drug strategy do not talk of 'minimising
the harm' arising from drug use (as in Australia's National Drug
Strategy); rather they aim to completely eliminate drug use, a
goal that many would consider to be unreachable. </p>

<p> Finally, in [22]Chapter Two of this report, we have suggested
that the harms caused by the drug control regimes themselves
should not outweigh the harms prevented by them. With respect to
cannabis use it has been argued that the harm caused by control
regimes clearly outweighs the harm caused by the drug
([23]Kleiman 1992). It has also been argued that those developing
policy in the US have failed to make the distinction between the
problems created by drugs and the problems created by prohibition
(e.g. [24]Wardlaw 1992). The USA has a number of severe social
problems associated with drug use, including forcing users into
the criminal milieu, demeaning the criminal law in the eyes of
users, increasing the number of people with criminal records,
increasing the level of imprisonment, and increasing the level of
transmission of the AIDS virus. These problems, and the
relatively limited achievements in reducing drug use and
drug-related problems, have prompted ever increasing efforts in
the 'war against drugs'. It is likely, however, that many of the
social problems are created not by the drugs themselves but by
the strategy of total prohibition. </p>

<h3>Part B: The Netherlands: </h3>

<p> <b>LEGISLATIVE PROHIBITION WITH AN ADMINISTRATIVE EXPEDIENCY
PRINCIPLE </b> </p>

<h4>Background </h4>

<p> Between the mid-1960s and the mid-1970s in The Netherlands,
the use of illegal drugs grew from 'almost non-existent to
constitute a serious health and public order problem in urban
areas' ([25]van Vliet 1990). Although the use of cannabis in The
Netherlands came to public attention in the late 1950s, debate on
drug policy only began in earnest when heroin use and the
problems associated with it became increasingly visible between
1972 and 1975. </p>

<p> Amendments to the Opium Act were introduced in 1976 and can
be seen as heralding a new era in drug policy. Until this time
drug policy in The Netherlands was much like that of other
countries ([26]Wijingaart 1990, p668, cited in [27]Wardlaw 1992,
p16). Drug law and policy in The Netherlands The Opium Act of
1976 makes a clear distinction between 'drugs presenting
unacceptable risks' (heroin, cocaine, LSD, amphetamines) and
'cannabis products'. The changes introduced in this legislation
increased penalties for dealing in 'drugs presenting unacceptable
risks' and decreased the penalties for possession and dealing in
cannabis products. </p>

<p> The purpose of the legislation was to separate drug markets
and user groups in an effort to prevent cannabis users from
involvement in the 'hard' drug scene. Although the legislation
falls clearly within a total prohibition framework, as Dutch
commentators have pointed out 'law in practice is more relevant
than law in books' ([28]Leuw 1991). A clause in The Netherlands
Code of Criminal Procedure, known as the 'expediency principle',
states that the prosecution office may decide whether or not to
enforce certain laws, to prosecute or to initiate criminal
investigation on the basis of whether or not such action would be
'in the public interest'. Using this clause, the Minister of
Justice issued guidelines in 1976 for the enforcement of drug
laws and the investigation and prosecution of breaches of drug
laws. </p>

<p> Essentially it is these guidelines rather than legislation
that determines drug policy in The Netherlands. [29]Marshall et
al. (1990) have noted that the priorities in the guidelines
correspond to the distinctions made between 'hard' and 'soft'
drugs in the Opium Act. High priority is given to detecting the
importation and exportation of drugs that are seen to represent
an 'unacceptable risk'. </p>

<p> Investigation and prosecution of 'soft' drug violations, with
the exception of the import and export of large amounts of such
drugs, are assigned a low priority (Marshall et al. 1990).
According to the guidelines, dealing, possessing or producing
small amounts (30g or less) of marijuana, do not require police
investigation, arrest or prosecution. A low priority is also
given to the investigation and prosecution of retail dealing in
cannabis, and police are only required to confront dealers when
they advertise publicly or conduct their business in a
provocative manner. As long as there is no sale to minors, no
advertising, no sale of 'hard' drugs, and if the dealing takes
place without causing a public nuisance, then (generally
speaking) there will be no police intervention. Where there are
breaches of the type outlined above, administrative measures,
such as the withdrawal of permits to serve drinks and food, are
imposed. If the parties involved persist in contravening the
guidelines, they are issued with a warning. Confiscation of the
drugs may be another consequence of continuing breaches of the
guidelines. [30]Marshall et al. (1990) report that only very
rarely is imprisonment the consequence of such violations. The
extent to which the guidelines, or the Opium Act, are followed
depends on local circumstances. Sanctions imposed may vary
between different districts of The Netherlands. </p>

<h4>Rationales </h4>

<h5>Pragmatic rationales </h5>

<p> The goals or rationales for Dutch drug policy include the
following: </p>

<ul>
    <li>to promote safer methods of consumption of cannabis; </li>
    <li>to limit sales of cannabis to specialist sellers; </li>
    <li>to limit progression from cannabis use to other drugs; </li>
    <li>to limit the amount of violence in the cannabis
        distribution system; and </li>
    <li>to limit the substitution of other (more damaging) drugs
        for cannabis. </li>
</ul>

<h5>Philosophical rationales </h5>

<p> The 'drug problem' in The Netherlands has always been
recognised as a complex social problem and as such, law
enforcement and penal sanctions alone have never been seen to
represent a complete solution . During the parliamentary debate
on the revised Opium Act of 1976 Irene Vorrink, the Minister of
Public Health, identified the following aims that form the basis
of drug policy in The Netherlands: </p>

<ul>
    <li>the central aim is the prevention and amelioration of
        social and individual risks caused by the use of drugs; </li>
    <li>a rational relation between those risks and policy
        measures; </li>
    <li>a differentiation of policy measures which will also take
        into account the risks of legal recreational and medical
        drugs; </li>
    <li>a priority of repressive measures against the trafficking
        of drugs other than cannabis; and </li>
    <li>the inadequacy of the criminal law with regard to any
        other aspect of the drug problem ([31] Handelingen 1976,
        cited in Leuw 1991, p10). </li>
</ul>

<p> The aims outlined above illustrate that The Netherlands drug
policy is characterised by a number of factors. First, the
criminal law was never thought to be a solution to the drug
problem. Government policy with respect to 'hard' drugs is
broadly based and focuses on treatment and assistance for the
user and punishment for the commercial dealer ([32]Marshall et
al. 1990). Secondly, it is recognised that the basis of drug
policy should be to minimise harm rather than eradicate drug use,
and thirdly, it is argued that drug policy should not be the same
for all illicit drugs. Cannabis is seen in a different light from
other drugs. Clearly there are pragmatic reasons for this
separation, as the user markets for different drugs are divided
and users of cannabis are, it is argued, less likely to progress
to the use of 'harder' drugs. </p>

<p> However there is also evidence that suggests that the use of
cannabis was never perceived by Dutch society to be a
particularly compelling social problem. Leuw claims that: In
accordance with the legal differentiation between cannabis
products and hard drugs, drug policy encompassing prevention and
assistance developed primarily in reaction to the emerging heroin
problem. The cannabis problem - if there ever had been one seemed
to have disappeared from the face of the earth even before the
amended Opium Act became effective ([33]Leuw 1991, p725). </p>

<p> The separation of cannabis from other drug problems also has
had the effect of making the drug problem more manageable.
[34]Van Vliet (1988) is critical of the US style of drug policy
that makes no moral or legal distinction between different types
of drug offences or different types of drugs and claims that 'by
lumping all these different phenomena together, societies and
governments help to create a problem which is unsolvable' (van
Vliet 1988). Conversely, The Netherlands breaks down the
'inextricable' problem into 'manageable bits'. </p>

<p> In the mid-1980s, a Government-sponsored research project led
to the development of the concept of 'normalisation' or 'cultural
integration' which added to the sophistication of Dutch drug
policy ([35]van Vliet 1990;[36] Leuw 1991). 'Normalisation'
recognises that some type of drug use is natural to all human
societies and argues that the eradication of all drug use is an
unrealistic policy goal. The reduction of drug use and the social
and individual problems associated with it are felt to be far
more reasonable policy goals. Central to the concept of
'normalisation' is the idea that drug users should not be
marginalised from the rest of society. In a speech to the Dutch
Parliament, the State Secretary of Health stated, in 1985, that:
Normalisation ... includes the cultural integration of drug users
in society ... This does not mean the elimination of the drug
phenomenon as a social reality: it means a change of context
which clears the way for a different approach ... drug addicts
should be treated neither as criminals nor as dependent patients
but as 'normal' people to whom we can make 'normal' demands and
who should be offered 'normal' opportunities ([37]van Vliet 1990,
p727). </p>

<p> The implications for cannabis policy of 'normalisation' are
clear. According to the Dutch, the eradication of cannabis use is
an unrealistic policy goal and the creation of a 'deviant status'
for drug users means that users are more likely to 'drop out' of
main stream society and perhaps start using more dangerous drugs.
The use of the criminal law to deal with cannabis use would
marginalise cannabis users and this would be seen as
unnecessarily destructive in terms of its social costs. </p>

<h4>Outcomes </h4>

<p> Today it is possible to openly buy and use cannabis in a
number of coffee shops in Amsterdam and other regional centres.
Most of these coffee shops do not sell any other drugs and many
do not even sell alcohol. However, the public consumption of
cannabis has been subject to criticism from other countries, who
seem to equate public consumption with increased use. Downes
(1988) has claimed that the image of The Netherlands portrayed in
the international media is one of 'a blinkered liberalism
belatedly struggling to cope with the results of its own
permissiveness' and cites an example of a British journalist who
wrote in the Sunday Times that 'Amsterdam has a long history of
free-thinking and tolerating most things except law and order ...
But the city's tolerance has been worn thin by crime, drug abuse
and militant squatters' ([38]Downes 1988, p123). </p>

<p> Unsurprisingly, Dutch commentators do not subscribe to the
view that their society is on the brink of collapse. They argue
that the 'hash cafes' have been integrated as normal urban
facilities and do not pose a threat to public order ([39]Leuw
1991). The point has also been made that visible drug use only
signals failure if maintaining an image of a drug-free society is
an aim of drug policy (Leuw 1991). In contrast, the Dutch, who
aim to prevent drug users from being marginalised, may see
visible drug use as a sign of success. </p>

<p> Despite the impression presented in the international media,
most studies suggest that the policies implemented in The
Netherlands have not resulted in any significant increase in drug
use or changes in patterns of use ([40]Engelsmann 1989;
Wijingaart 1988a cited in [41]Wardlaw 1992, p23). A recent study
combined the results of over 20 Dutch studies that examined the
percentage of the population who had 'ever used' cannabis and
compared them with data from Norway, Sweden and the USA. The
period from 1970 to 1988 was examined and the authors concluded
that: </p>

<p> The results of the time analysis show that the prevalence of
cannabis use since 1970 decreased, whereas the policy became more
tolerant. Since 1979 a slight increase in the use of cannabis can
be observed. A comparison with data from other countries with a
more restrictive policy reveals that the use of cannabis in The
Netherlands is on the same level as in Sweden and Norway (around
10-15 per cent), but far lower than that in the US (exceeding 50
per cent). However the downward trend in these three countries
since 1984 did not occur in The Netherlands ([42]Driesen, van Dam
&amp; Olsen 1989, p11 cited in Leuw 1991). </p>

<p> The savings made to law enforcement and criminal justice
budgets of not processing large numbers of cannabis offenders are
substantial and should be seen as one of the primary benefits of
the Dutch approach to drug policy. In addition, the cannabis
market and distribution system is free from violence ([43]van
Vliet 1990). </p>

<p> It has also been argued that the Dutch approach has led to
safer patterns of cannabis use. First, the fact that users of
cannabis do not seem to turn to other more dangerous drugs is
used as evidence that the policy of the separation of drug
markets is working ([44]van Vliet 1990). [45]Cohen (1988) argues
that Dutch cannabis users, unlike their counterparts in the USA,
are not likely to ingest the herbicide paraquat in the cannabis
that they consume, and are also more likely to consume the drug
in a safer way because the sale of drug paraphernalia such as
water pipes is legal in The Netherlands (Cohen 1988). Cohen has
also argued that 'the knowledge of how to regulate cannabis use
has become an inconspicuous part of local Dutch youth culture
because the development of drug use rules was not pushed out of
the mainstream and into deviant sub cultures' (Cohen 1988, p24). </p>

<p> In terms of the goals that Dutch policy makers identified,
drug policy in The Netherlands has been moderately successful.
However, the Dutch approach to drug policy has not been popular
internationally: Germany and the USA in particular have been
vocal in their opposition. In recent times this has led to the
introduction of tougher drug policies with respect to 'hard
drugs' ([46]Marshall et al. 1990), however these pressures have
not yet had any impact on cannabis policy. Indeed, it has been
speculated that Dutch cannabis policy is unlikely to change as a
result of international pressure ([47]Wardlaw 1992). </p>

<h4>CONCLUSION - THE DUTCH APPROACH </h4>

<p> In a variety of ways The Netherlands drug policy meets many
of the criteria outlined in [48]Chapter 2. </p>

<p> First, Dutch policy makers have recognised the need to have
different policies for different drugs. The idea of separating
'drugs of unacceptable risk' and cannabis is based on the idea
that the control regime that appears to be appropriate for one
illicit drug need not apply to others. </p>

<p> Secondly, policy makers have managed to separate arguments
about the consequences of drug use from arguments about morals.
In fact, Dutch policy was intended to be 'non-moralistic'
([49]Leuw 1991). It has been claimed that, in The Netherlands,
drug use has never been seen as a 'moral' issue and it is argued
that: Political speeches elaborating on the abhorrence of illegal
drugs have seldom been staged. They would appear as quite
misplaced in Dutch political culture. Consequently there are no
votes to be won or positions to be conquered by rallying an
anti-drug theme ([50]Leuw 1991). </p>

<p> Thirdly, this non-moralistic approach to drug policy has led
to the development of realistic policy goals with respect to
cannabis use. [51]Leuw (1991) notes that in The Netherlands there
has been no pledge of 'solving the problem' of drug use. Instead
of attempting to eradicate drug use Dutch authorities have
adopted the more pragmatic goal of minimising the risks and
damaging effects of drug use. Of concern to some observers,
however, is the Dutch approach of formalising inconsistency
between the provisions of legislation and its implementation. An
argument can be advanced that this conveys confusing messages to
the community. It is preferable, some would argue, for
legislation and policy on implementation to be aligned so that
both permit (or proscribe) the use of cannabis in certain
circumstances. Having legislation creating an offence of cannabis
use, along with policy declaring that it is inexpedient to
prosecute such offences, seems to be acceptable in the Dutch
context, although it would possibly be unacceptable in other
cultures. We return to this apparent difficulty in the concluding
chapter of this report. </p>

<h2>Conclusion - the total prohibition options </h2>

<p> The Netherlands has been successful in terms of the goals
identified by Dutch policy makers. Their policy has not resulted
in the increased use of cannabis; indeed levels of cannabis use
are markedly lower than those seen in the United States or
Australia. There is little violence associated with the cannabis
distribution system, cannabis users do not seem to progress to
using more serious drugs and the drug is consumed in a manner
whereby the risks of harm are minimised. </p>

<p> Dutch policy is also relatively successful in terms of many
of the policy goals that we discussed above. The separation of
cannabis from other drugs ensures that The Netherlands has a more
manageable drug policy. The goals of policy are realistic and
policy makers have not confused moral arguments with arguments
about the consequences of drug use. </p>

<p> In contrast, the US drug strategy with respect to cannabis
does not seem to be particularly successful. Despite considerable
economic and social costs, cannabis use is far from being
eradicated in the USA. Cannabis users may be consuming the drug
in a particularly dangerous manner, the illicit drugs
distribution system (of which cannabis is a part) is associated
with violence, and law enforcement, criminal justice processing
and the imprisonment of cannabis-related offenders costs American
tax payers millions of dollars every year. </p>

<p> The USA has not emerged favourably in relation to the goals
identified in the first part of this report. Apparently American
policy makers have not recognised the need to consider different
policy strategies for different drugs, leaving cannabis part of
the larger, seemingly unsolvable 'drug problem'. Moral arguments
have been confused with arguments about the consequences of drug
use, and this has led to the development of unrealistic policy
goals and a failure to recognise that the control regime imposed
to deal with the problem of cannabis use may be causing more harm
than the cannabis use itself. Examples from the USA and The
Netherlands demonstrate that the legislative option of total
prohibition can be implemented in very different ways. The two
countries have very different philosophical and pragmatic
rationales for their policies and, unsurprisingly, the outcomes
of the policies have varied considerably. </p>

<p> In developing policy, international examples are of benefit
to Australian policy makers. It should be remembered, however,
that the relative success or failure of drug policies depend as
much on cultural factors, existing patterns of drug use, and
public views of drug use, as they do on the soundness of the
policy. </p>

<h1>CHAPTER 5: DIVERSION AND COMPULSORY TREATMENT </h1>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.GIF"> </p>

<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p> This chapter covers the two related fields of diversion and
treatment - including compulsory treatment - for drug offenders,
particularly where cannabis is involved. Such diversion may
simply involve diversion from the criminal justice system for
individuals involved in minor cannabis offences; it may also
involve diversion to treatment for those who either want, or are
judged by others, to need treatment for drug use sufficiently
serious to bring them into contact with the criminal justice
system. </p>

<p> Diversion is a form of intervention in the lives of offenders
primarily based on humanitarian grounds (i.e. to keep them out of
prison), but also, more pragmatically, to relieve the burden on
the courts and the prisons imposed by the very large numbers of
people charged with very minor offences. While diversion from a
court appearance is a mild form of intervention receiving broad
community support, diversion to treatment, particularly when
mandated by the court, raises philosophical issues relating to
the degree of intervention the state should be empowered to
exercise over people's lives. Compulsory treatment when it takes
the form of civil commitment is the most extreme form of
intervention, and, where ordered for drug offenders, is morally
distasteful to many and the subject of much controversy.
Nevertheless, there are legislative provisions for civil
commitment of drug offenders in many countries, including
Australia. </p>

<p> We begin the chapter with a discussion of the concept of
diversion, then review existing diversion programs in Australia
and overseas, with particular reference to programs involving
treatment. The subject of compulsory treatment, including civil
commitment for drug offenders, is dealt with next, with an
overview of international legislation and treatment programs,
along with such evaluations as exist. The implications of this
for offenders whose primary drug is cannabis are discussed and
some conclusions are drawn regarding treatment for repeat
offenders. </p>

<p> Finally, we present a summary of the major findings for
cannabis users resulting from our review of the key Australian
and international literature dealing with diversion and treatment
for drug offenders. The concept of diversion In the US, according
to Tomasic ([1]1977, cited in Dept of Attorney-General 1982, p6),
official use of the term 'diversion' occurred for the first time
in the US President's Commission on Law Enforcement and
Administration of Justice. The following are two definitions of
diversion from the US literature: ... the disposition of a
criminal complaint without conviction, the non-criminal
disposition being conditioned on either the performance of
specified obligations by the defendant, or his participation in
counselling or treatment, ([2]Nimmer 1974, cited in Dept of
Attorney-General 1982, p6). ... those formally acknowledged and
organised efforts to utilize alternatives to the initial or
continued criminal justice processing of alleged offenders, which
are undertaken prior to adjudication but after a prosecutable
action has occurred, ([3]Rovner-Pieczenik, cited in Dept of
Attorney-General 1982, p6). Due to fears, in the case of
non-trial disposition, of unfairness, lack of procedural
protection and lack of follow-up treatment to prevent recurrence
of the offence, the Commission recommended formalising the
procedure and adding extra-legal services such as treatment and
preventative education as an integral part of the non-trial
disposition. The total package came to be known as 'diversion'
([4]Dept of Attorney-General 1982, p8). </p>

<p> The early justifications for diversion included: </p>

<ul>
    <li>relief of overburdened courts; </li>
    <li>avoiding the further criminalisation of first offenders; </li>
    <li>avoiding the disadvantaging of first offenders on
        re-entry to society by their being labelled as criminals;
    </li>
    <li>providing a preferable way of dealing with certain
        offenders such as juveniles or drug users, who could be
        better dealt with in the community than in prisons; and </li>
    <li>providing cost-benefits to the community and a more
        humane way of dealing with certain categories of
        offenders ([5]Dept of Attorney-General 1982, p9). </li>
</ul>

<p> The term 'diversion' when used in relation to the Australian
criminal justice system may incorporate a 'range of related but
relatively exclusive procedures some of which are seen as
potential alternatives to &quot;due process&quot; others as
additions to it' ([6]Williams 1981, p3). Those falling into the
'alternatives' classification include: </p>

<ul>
    <li>pre-arrest diversion: this amounts to discretionary
        measures taken by police at the point of apprehension of
        an offender; and </li>
    <li>pre-trial diversion (or 'pre-court', in Australia): in
        this case certain conditions have to be satisfied by the
        offender, following which the alleged offences are struck
        off the record. </li>
</ul>

<p> Those falling into the 'additions' classification include: +
pre-sentence diversion: this is essentially remand for assessment
and/or treatment; and + post-conviction diversion: in this case
offenders are directed to some form of treatment-related
supervision as a part of their sentence (presumably in lieu of
imprisonment). Prisoners may also be diverted from jail to
treatment as a condition of their parole. These additions to due
process, therefore, function as increased sentencing options
([7]Williams 1981, p3). </p>

<p> The subject of diversion has been a neglected area in
Australia, although there have been 'official' diversionary
programs operating at least since 1977 (in NSW). The term
diversion is applied to a wide variety of programs, and in
Australia can occur pre-court or pre- or post-sentence. Pre-court
diversion can vary from a police warning or an expiation notice
for a minor drug offence, to referral for drug-treatment as an
alternative to a punitive sentence. </p>

<p> Unlike some countries, in Australia cannabis use and
possession offences are not regarded as very serious in
comparison with offences involving 'harder' drugs, and the
subject of treatment for cannabis use has similarly not been
considered much of an issue. In fact the legislation in some
States does not cover diversion for treatment on the grounds of
cannabis use alone. If cannabis users are diverted for treatment
it is usually because they are polydrug users, as many of the
more serious users are. </p>

<p> The main diversion programs operating in Australia will be
briefly described, and an overview presented of diversion in the
US and other countries, with reference to their relevance for
cannabis users. Key features of treatment programs for drug users
are discussed, along with the issue of compulsory treatment and,
what is known in the United States as, civil commitment. </p>

<h2>Diversion programs in Australia (10) </h2>

<h3>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY </h3>

<p> The ACT Drugs of Dependence Act 1989 (as amended in 1992 and
1993) allows as a sentencing option anyone found guilty of a
crime to be sent for assessment as to whether they are
drug-dependent and therefore suitable to be referred for
treatment. Those brought to court usually appear on a combination
of charges of different degrees of seriousness. Often a community
service order may be the sentence or a conviction on
recognisance, which can include a good behaviour bond or a
partially or fully suspended sentence. Assessment or treatment
orders are rare and are typically given for such offences as
unlawful possession, stolen property offences, burglary and motor
vehicle theft (where drug dependence is believed to have
contributed to the criminal behaviour).11 </p>

<p> The DODA (Drugs of Dependence) Referral Program works in the
following way: anyone committing an offence requiring a court
appearance who seems to defence counsel to have a drug problem
(or who claims to have a drug problem) is entitled to have this
fact raised before sentencing. If the court issues an assessment
order, the client then has to contact the DODA Referral Program
where a counsellor takes a case history to be sent to the
Treatment Assessment Panel. The panel consists of a legal person
(usually a solicitor) and two others with extensive knowledge of
drug and alcohol treatment in the ACT, who are appointed for a
year. The client is assessed and options for treatment put
forward. The client then goes to the chosen treatment centre
which reports back to the panel as to whether the client is
suitable or not suitable for treatment. The client then goes back
to the panel for a second time at which time the panel looks at
the information from the treatment centre and listens to what the
client has to say, since the client has high input and
responsibility throughout the process. If the client fails to
come back (or fails to attend at any stage) an arrest warrant may
be issued, or the panel may suggest a Breach of Assessment Order.
This information goes to the court, where a warrant for arrest
may be issued, or the failure to attend may be brought up when
the client next comes before the court and the client may lose
the right to the alternative to sentencing. This does not happen
very often, as the court usually chooses the treatment order when
they have the option. The court specifies the length of time at
the treatment centre and periodic reviews by the panel, which can
be every three months. The program tries to be lenient if the
client misses one or two reviews, as the objective is harm
minimisation rather than abstinence (unless the client has opted
for abstinence). If the client consistently fails to appear for
review or is not doing well (this is not the usual outcome) it is
possible to breach them. The breach is issued in court but DODA
provides the report on behalf of the panel. Then a summons can be
issued and the usual court process (arrest warrant issued) is
followed. </p>

<p> The magistrate primarily concerned with diversion made the
following observations: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Most drug-related offences are caused by alcohol, often
        used in conjunction with cannabis, which is particularly
        dangerous if the offender is driving. The DODA Program
        does not cover alcohol. </li>
    <li>There is concern about the danger posed by offenders
        combining alcohol and cannabis prior to driving (many
        alcohol-dependent people coming before the DODA treatment
        panel are also cannabis-dependent). </li>
    <li>Clients should not be referred for treatment in the case
        of cannabis use unless assessed as 'seriously dependent
        on cannabis', in order to screen out those seeking simply
        to avoid conviction. </li>
    <li>A distinct preference was expressed for post-court
        diversion, as opposed to pre-court diversion, so that the
        court has the opportunity to assess offenders. </li>
    <li>Offenders may be diverted more than once. The goal is
        'harm reduction', and total rehabilitation is not
        expected after the first treatment. </li>
</ul>

<p> It was confirmed by the magistrate and treatment personnel
that there have been clients coming to the program who complain
of cannabis dependence. Personnel at the DODA Referral Program
report that there is very little treatment for cannabis users. It
is usually outpatient treatment and 'is not 100 per cent
successful'. The treatment they use is adapted from the treatment
for tobacco, i.e. a process of slow cessation, while keeping a
diary of the situations and times of use, with counselling once a
week. Ideally the treatment should be tailored to the
individual's needs. Very few cannabis users would be referred to
a residential facility such as Karralika, and if so, it would be
on the grounds of polydrug use. </p>

<p> The DODA program is the only one of its sort in Australia,
and mainly deals with fairly longstanding opiate users with
lengthy records. There is a juvenile panel, but this has not been
used much. If magistrates send more juveniles in future, the
program would be especially relevant for alcohol use. A formal
evaluation has not yet been done, but program staff claim the
following desirable results: a reduction in criminal activity on
the part of its clients; monitoring their progress rather than
seeing them go to jail; and reducing their drug use. Very few
become drug-free, but there is significant harm reduction from
the social, personal and economic viewpoint. </p>

<h3>SOUTH AUSTRALIA </h3>

<p> The drug diversion scheme operating in South Australia was
established when the Controlled Substances Act 1984 provided for
the South Australian Drug Assessment and Aid Panel (the panel) as
an alternative to the criminal law for illicit drug users.12 The
panel is only one of 13 penalty outcomes for drug offenders in
South Australia, ranging from a $50 expiation fee for possession
of small amounts of cannabis and cannabis resin to $1 million and
life imprisonment for the most serious trafficking offence. The
underlying philosophy is to make a clear distinction between the
drug dealer and the drug user (Gray, Reynolds &amp; Rumbold
1992). </p>

<p> The new Act came about primarily as a result of the
recommendation of the Sackville Commission that drug assessment
and aid panels should be established to which all persons charged
with simple possession offences involving drugs must be referred
before a prosecution may proceed. Juvenile Aid Panels were also
established - as an alternative to the juvenile court system -
which continue to operate and to provide for the diversion of
some, but not all, young offenders out of the criminal justice
system ([8]Gray, Reynolds &amp; Rumbold 1992). </p>

<p> The panel provides for absolute diversion in so far as the
panel and its clients, not the courts and prosecutors, determine
the outcome of proceedings. All persons charged with a 'simple
possession' offence (i.e. involving personal use of illicit drugs
other than cannabis and cannabis resin and including use or
possession of implements for the use of an illicit drug) must be
referred to the panel, thus precluding any issue of discretion on
the part of courts or prosecutors, and removing the offender from
the court system ([9]Gray, Reynolds &amp; Rumbold 1992, p129). </p>

<p> The panel, however, considers only a limited number of
offences, and although an amendment to the Act permitted courts
to refer matters to the panel for the preparation of pre-sentence
reports, this power has rarely been exercised ([10]Gray, Reynolds
&amp; Rumbold 1992, p130). The panel consists of a lawyer and two
people with extensive knowledge of the problems and/or treatment
of illicit drug use. Hearings are private and proceedings
confidential in order to create an atmosphere of trust. Clients
are referred from either the police or the courts, more often the
former. Before being dealt with by the panel, the client must
have admitted to the offence and be willing to undertake the
assessment and any treatment or counselling which may be
required. The client may choose the option of being dealt with by
the courts. Those who do not appear willing to change their lives
and those who do not respond to the initial letter from the panel
or attend their appointment are referred back to court. </p>

<p> Those dealt with by the panel must undertake to comply with
the directions of the panel and attend panel sessions as
requested over a six-month period.13 At the end of this period
the panel instructs the court and the police to withdraw the
matter, and no record of any drug offence may be used
subsequently against the client ([11]Gray, Reynolds &amp; Rumbold
1992, p129). </p>

<p> The major findings of an evaluation of the panel were that: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Out of the 1,400 clients seen between May 1985 and
        September 1991, most were male and in their 20s, directed
        to the panel for illegal possession of, mostly,
        amphetamines followed by heroin. </li>
    <li>The panel did not provide the early intervention hoped
        for. Although most clients were being offered the
        opportunity for assessment for treatment for the first
        time, many already had criminal histories. Intervention
        at an earlier stage is desirable for a more successful
        outcome. </li>
    <li>The amount of polydrug use 'should be seen as a matter of
        significance and concern. This includes the dangerous -
        though legal - drugs, alcohol and tobacco, which will
        often prove more of a problem and potentially more
        destructive to clients than the illicit drug problem that
        brought them to the attention of the panel in the first
        place' ([12]Gray, Reynolds &amp; Rumbold 1992, p133). </li>
    <li>While cannabis and cannabis resin offences were excluded
        from the panel's jurisdiction, 'there were indications of
        extensive and potentially harmful levels of cannabis use
        among many clients' ([13]Gray, Reynolds &amp; Rumbold
        1992, p132). </li>
    <li>The characteristics of most of the clients were such that
        the treatment required was based on coping and lifestyle
        skills 'rather than strategies influenced by models of
        physiological addiction' ([14]Gray, Reynolds &amp;
        Rumbold 1992, p132). </li>
    <li>The panel is only as effective as the treatment and other
        social supports which are available. </li>
    <li>The statutory barrier allowing only people over 18 to be
        seen by the panel means that many have had drug habits
        for years. Although structured to deal with these cases,
        the Childrens Aid Panel is not sufficiently a specialist
        drug assessment and aid body, nor are drugs its primary
        concern. </li>
</ol>

<p> Overall 'the justification for the panel as a means of
diverting offenders from the criminal justice system and
providing intervention opportunities is overwhelming' ([15]Gray,
Reynolds &amp; Rumbold 1992, p134). Interviews with criminal
justice personnel indicated that the panel is satisfactory from
the point of view of cutting down on court congestion and from
the point of view that it is treatment-focused rather than
punitive. There is also no stigma of a conviction being recorded.
However, it seems that within the confines of the Act, the police
have the discretion as to what charge to lay, e.g. if the
offender is known by the police and has an amount of the drug
which could be trafficked, he may instead be charged with
trafficking. </p>

<h3>NEW SOUTH WALES </h3>

<p> Offences relating to alcohol or drug use in New South Wales
are covered by the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW).
This Act distinguishes between cannabis and other drugs only in
the case of commercial trafficking. Possession and administration
of cannabis are prosecuted summarily and offenders are liable to
a penalty of $2,000 and/or two years' imprisonment. Cultivation,
manufacture and production, and supply are prosecuted on
indictment, an offender being liable to a fine of $2,000 and/or
two years imprisonment if there are less than five plants or less
than a quantity of 25g. New South Wales was the first State in
Australia to introduce a drug diversion program. </p>

<p> Its current program, the Drug and Alcohol Court Assessment
Programme (DACAP) is a post-conviction, pre-sentence program
where offenders on drug-related charges (such as possession of an
illicit substance) or drug-involved crime (such as property crime
to finance drug use) are bailed/remanded to attend a treatment
agency and undergo a comprehensive assessment which forms the
basis of a pre-sentence report for the magistrate, containing
recommendations for sentencing, including treatment options
([16]Desland &amp; Batey 1990, p796). </p>

<p> Successful completion of the treatment program, the length of
which is determined by a health worker, finalises the matter
([17]Walters &amp; Coventry 1993). A further objective is to
'provide drug offenders with a comprehensive assessment that may
encourage them to consider improving their health and social
functioning' ([18]Schlosser 1984, pxi). </p>

<p> DACAP further attempts through these assessments to match the
individual's drug-related problems to the most appropriate range
of therapeutic interventions within a legal/health framework
(Schlosser 1984).'... the diversion from the Criminal Justice
System to the health care system provides to the offender in many
cases, the initial insight and confrontation that criminal
activities are directly related to their health. Often this
insight initiates motivation to address the problems of substance
abuse' ([19]MSJ Keys Young, 1992, p92). </p>

<p> DACAP statistics between 1990 and 1992 indicate that, while
heroin was the main drug of concern (after alcohol) in about one
case in five, both in 1990-91 and 1991-92, cannabis was the next
ranking drug ([20]MSJ Keys Young, 1992, p96).14 An interview with
one of DACAP's clients who had been arrested for possession and
supply of a large amount of cannabis revealed that, although he
knew that he had 'a big marijuana problem', he had never been
prepared to do anything about it and that DACAP provided the
opportunity and a reason to 'address the issue'. The magistrate
placed this client under supervision, fined him, imposed a
sentence of periodic detention, with 20 hours at an Attendance
Centre and the requirement to undertake a series of courses on
issues such as personal development, money management, drug and
alcohol information and education. The client fulfilled these
requirements ([21]MSJ Keys Young, 1992, p118). </p>

<p> MSJ Keys Young's recent evaluation of DACAP included the
observations that: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Magistrates generally agreed that a DACAP report might be
        considered appropriate in cases involving a relatively
        serious and/or repeated offence, where a custodial
        sentence was a realistic possibility (some used it even
        where a custodial sentence was unlikely), and where it
        appeared that drug/alcohol dependency might be a
        significant factor (1992, p113). </li>
    <li>It was very desirable to use the pre-sentence 'crisis'
        period to get the dependency problem acknowledged and, if
        possible, to start treatment, as if left until after
        sentence, the chances of success were much less (1992,
        p105); sometimes it takes a long time for a drug user to
        recognise dependency (e.g. in the case of cannabis) and
        an intervention such as that of DACAP can be very
        beneficial in confronting this. </li>
    <li>Some magistrates observed that they did not see many
        people who had been through the DACAP process coming
        before the court for repeat offences. Important issues
        were availability of places in treatment and skilled
        counsellors with broad views of dependency. Regarding the
        issue of coercion, several evaluations of DACAP have
        'tentatively concluded' that the legal coercion into
        treatment as evidenced in the DACAP program was effective
        in acting as an early intervention into drug use,
        generating a younger client less involved with drugs, who
        is more amenable to an abstinent outcome (Desland &amp;
        Batey 1988; [22]Schlosser 1984; [23]Bush &amp; Scagliotti
        1983; [24]Williams 1981; all cited in Desland &amp; Batey
        1988, p51). This is consistent with other studies of
        court-ordered assessment/treatment for substance use
        ([25]Salmon &amp; Salmon 1983, cited in Desland &amp;
        Batey 1987, p51). </li>
</ul>

<h3>VICTORIA </h3>

<p> Victoria appears not to have any government-implemented
pre-court drug diversion programs ([26]Walters &amp; Coventry
1993). The Alcoholics and Drug Dependent Person's Act 1968 (Vic),
s13 provides for bonds under which offenders may be ordered to
attend treatment as an alternative to a custodial sentence (Skene
1986, cited in [27]Walters 1993, p11). Programs are available for
offenders who are detected to be intoxicated at the time of the
offence and considered by the court to be 'habitually using
intoxicating liquor or drugs of addiction'. </p>

<p> The Court Advice and Assessment Programme precipitates a
court report which makes recommendations on the suitability of a
community-based order, and provides a management plan based on
the offender's level of substance use. Referral to the program is
at the discretion of the court, and applies only at the
magistrate's jurisdiction, but is not limited to particular
offences ([28]Gray, Reynolds &amp; Rumbold 1992, p130). In
addition, s67 of the Act allows for a good behaviour bond for
first offenders so that the number of drug users ending up in
court is not large. </p>

<p> A current study being carried out in Victoria by the National
Centre for Socio-Legal Studies ([29]Walters &amp; Coventry 1993)
for the Victoria Police, is considering a pilot pre-court drug
diversion program for 'all first-time drug offenders apprehended
for use and possession offences regardless of the illicit
substance'. At the time of detection and arrest these offenders
would be considered 'recreational users', and one option for
processing such offenders would be a diversion panel. In this
case it would be up to the panel to assess the nature and extent
of drug use and recommend a course of action ([30]Walters &amp;
Coventry 1993, p7). </p>

<h3>WESTERN AUSTRALIA </h3>

<p> In Western Australia, the Bail Act 1982 provides for
treatment as a condition of bail in the case of a defendant who
is suffering from alcohol or drug dependence. Their pre-court
diversion system, the Court Diversion Service (CDS) has been
operating since 1988 as a cooperative venture between the West
Australian Alcohol and Drug Authority (WAADA), the Department of
Corrective Services and non-government drug treatment agencies,
coordinated by the WAADA. Any person with a drug dependency
problem who is charged with a criminal offence is entitled to
apply to the court for inclusion in the CDS program. However, it
is important to note that persons are disqualified whose primary
drug problem is alcohol or cannabis unless there is evidence of
other current substance use that is a contributing factor.
Informal referral and preassessment does occur and clients may
voluntarily engage with a treatment agency prior to a formal
referral by the court (CDS 1993). CDS policy requires only that a
person admit to substance use, not to an alleged offence, thus
the person can be formally engaged in treatment for an admitted
drug problem and maintain a not guilty plea throughout the legal
proceedings. </p>

<p> If formal referral does not occur, the CDS is not empowered
to oversee the defendant's drug treatment and no CDS reports can
be provided to the courts on the defendants progress (CDS 1993). </p>

<p> When formal referral to the CDS does occur, defendants are
informed of the relevant drug treatment agencies and their
philosophies, and must choose. They are then required to remain
with that agency unless otherwise instructed by the CDS officer.
Court appearances after formal referral are accompanied by
interim reports regarding progress, and at the point of plea or
of a finding of guilt the defendant is generally remanded for a
full pre-sentence report. The coercive nature of the CDS in
engaging drug dependent persons in treatment programs during
times of legal crisis is acknowledged, and it is emphasised to
potential clients that progress in treatment is only one aspect
taken into consideration by the sentencing judge or magistrate
(CDS 1993). </p>

<p> CDS personnel expressed the view that, whereas in the early
days of the program there were mostly self-referrals, now most
are court-generated. People have always had the option of
treatment but clearly the catalyst is often a legal charge. The
more familiar the courts become with the process the more it is
used, and it is regarded as being generally well accepted. </p>

<p> Pre-court or pre-sentence diversion? As long as personal
cannabis use/possession/cultivation remains illegal, the
fundamental problem exists of the involvement of police
discretion and variation in enforcement policies from one officer
to another and from one jurisdiction to another. Any contact
between the cannabis user and the police (at street level) or
between the user and the court has the potential for the
individual to have continuing involvement with the criminal
justice system. Police discretion at street level at the point of
arrest (or non-arrest) is inevitable. Police officers have the
discretion regarding whether or not to issue an expiation notice
(in jurisdictions such as South Australia) or (in jurisdictions
such as Victoria) to choose which (if any) of a number of
possible charges they will lay, which can vary from possession to
trafficking. </p>

<p> While this could work in the interests of the offender, it
may also act in a discriminatory fashion, which is why many would
make the argument in favour of diversion systems which bring all
offenders before the court, thus guaranteeing them due process.
Many lawyers tend to support leaving the conventional criminal
processing intact 'to ensure that the diversion program does not
result in more coercive treatment of offenders through the
non-judicial exercise of discretion' (Dept of Attorney General
1982, p78). In the case of expiation fines, it appears that many
fines are not being expiated.15 Therefore the objective of
relieving the burden on the courts, while achieved to a
substantial degree, has not yet been 100 per cent successful, and
there is room for improvement in terms of reducing the number of
non-expiators and consequently removing more offenders from the
criminal justice system. </p>

<h2>Diversion programs in other countries </h2>

<h3>UNITED STATES </h3>

<p> The most prominent drug diversion programs in the US are the
Treatment Alternatives to Street Crime (TASC) programs,
established primarily to try to reduce the crime associated with
drug use (mainly heroin). This national pre-trial diversion
program was expanded to include all drug users (except those
dependent on alcohol), including juveniles, recruited at all
points of entry to the criminal justice system (e.g. through
pre-sentence referral, conditional probation, police diversion
and conditional parole). The program varies with the different
legal systems and drug problems existing from State to State. For
instance, marijuana users and juveniles were excluded in
Colorado, whereas in Michigan marijuana users were preferred.
Overall, however, most programs concentrated on heroin users
([31]Dept of Attorney-General 1982, pp10-11). </p>

<p> Such programs were not particularly amenable to satisfactory
evaluation and usually were restricted to an examination of how
well program objectives had been met. The results indicated: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Dissatisfaction among law enforcement officials because
        of reduced opportunities for information from defendants
        regarding drug supplies (an example of the clash of
        philosophies between health authorities and law
        enforcement, which can be a factor contributing to
        failure in many diversion programs; this also indicates
        the emphasis on the supply reduction approach in the US,
        which is greater than that in Australia). </li>
    <li>Most of those diverted did not totally abstain from
        marijuana use although they reported reduced use (again
        this was not acceptable from the US total prohibition
        point of view, but a reduction in use can be seen as a
        successful program outcome in many treatment programs in
        Australia). </li>
    <li>There were fewer arrests and convictions (though
        marginally) among those diverted. </li>
    <li>There was some reduction in workload in the case of the
        prosecutor and the court but greatly increased workloads
        for the probation service. </li>
    <li>Purely from the treatment outcome point of view for the
        individual, the results were encouraging (though lack of
        adequate data precluded assessment of recidivism over the
        long term). Individuals' characteristics prior to program
        entry are an important determinant to successful program
        outcome (Rovner-Pieczenik cited in [32]Dept of
        Attorney-General 1982, p14). </li>
</ul>

<p> Criticisms of the program also include: </p>

<ul>
    <li>The argument that the workloads of courts and prisons are
        not really reduced because people are being brought into
        the criminal justice process who would not have been
        processed at all, since they would have been handled in
        the community. </li>
    <li>Diversion programs are sometimes utilised by prosecutors
        and courts when less official procedures might accomplish
        the same objective with less intervention and use of
        court time. </li>
    <li>The court is saved time only if the accused would have
        gone to trial and then to jail. </li>
</ul>

<p> However diversion appears to be more an 'alternative to
dismissal of charges or probation than to incarceration'
(Gorelick 1975 cited in [33]Dept of Attorney General 1982, p16).
This view was also shared by the Canadian Law Reform Commission
(Dept of Attorney-General 1982). Further criticisms were: </p>

<ul>
    <li>That diversion might also come to carry with it a social
        stigma if it is an 'institutionalised element of the
        criminal justice system'. </li>
    <li>Unsuccessful participants may be disadvantaged when
        returned to the court system. </li>
    <li>Legal analysts are concerned about the exercise of
        judicial discretion by non-judicial bodies. </li>
    <li>Diversion could be seen as an expansion of social
        control, and the concept of 'need for treatment' has no
        inherent limitation ([34]Dept of Attorney-General 1982,
        pp16-17). </li>
</ul>

<p> All of the points made above are also valid for Australian
diversion schemes. A very recent form of pre-court intervention
(for the purpose of treatment) operating in the US is the Weekend
Intervention Program (WIP) which is reported to be 'highly
effective in identifying and intervening with persons charged
with alcohol- and other drug-related driving offences' (Siegal
&amp; Cole 1993). </p>

<p> The underlying philosophy of the program is that the crisis
nature of an encounter with the criminal justice system, if
successfully managed, provides a valuable opportunity to
intervene in an individual's life by identifying the clinical
needs of substance users who are not yet receiving treatment, and
in a non-punitive way 'gently' confronting participants with the
consequences of their own drug and alcohol use. The individual is
provided with a diagnostic assessment and treatment program
recommendation 'with a specificity unavailable through
traditional settings' ([35]Siegal &amp; Cole 1993, p133). The
program consists of a three-day residential program to which
persons involved in a drug or alcohol offence may be remanded by
a court or other supervising agency. It consists of 'Marathon
substance abuse counselling sessions using a
cognitive-behavioural-oriented approach combined with
presentations structured around a modified health belief model'.
This participation in the assessment and referral process itself
is regarded as being able to help prepare the substance user for
any treatment to be received ([36]Siegal &amp; Cole 1993,
pp133-4). </p>

<h3>NEW ZEALAND </h3>

<p> New Zealand has an adult pre-trial diversion scheme which
commenced operation in 1988. It was developed and is managed by
the New Zealand Police as part of a wider program which entails
an increasing emphasis on the use of discretion by police in
their handling of minor offenders. The scheme is not, at present,
statutorily based although the Government is considering this
option. </p>

<p> The scheme is widely accepted by police officers, members of
the judiciary and practising lawyers, as well as the offenders
who are offered pre-trial diversion. The New Zealand Police have
described the scheme in the following terms: The key steps in the
scheme are that the offender must be a first offender (there are
limited exceptions in special cases), there is sufficient
evidence to charge the offender, and information is then laid and
at that stage the offender is considered for diversion. If the
offender meets the criteria [see below] and admits the offence to
the diversion coordinator (a police prosecutor) the court is
asked to adjourn the case until the offender has completed the
requirements of the diversion scheme. Those requirements may
consist of paying money to a charity, doing community work,
and/or attending specialist counselling depending on what problem
they may have, e.g. drugs, alcohol, anger management, etc. Once
the requirements have been completed the police ask the court to
withdraw the information (personal communication, New Zealand
Police, 17 December 1993). If the court agrees to withdraw the
information, the offender is not convicted and the police destroy
the offender's records, including fingerprints. </p>

<p> The criteria for diversion are not rigid; they include the
following: </p>

<ol>
    <li>The offender should be a first offender. </li>
    <li>There should be special circumstances which make the
        offender suitable for diversion. </li>
    <li>The offence must be non-serious. </li>
    <li>The offender must admit guilt, show remorse, and be
        prepared to pay full reparation to the victim. </li>
    <li>The victim must agree to diversion. </li>
    <li>The officer in charge of the case [generally the
        arresting officer] must agree to diversion. </li>
    <li>The offender must agree to diversion ([37]Young &amp;
        Cameron 1991, pp9-10). </li>
</ol>

<p> The use of cannabis and the possession of small quantities
for personal use are considered to be minor offences, making an
offender eligible for consideration for diversion. (Clearly the
criterion relating to the consent of the victim is not relevant
in such cases.) Consultants reviewed the scheme for the New
Zealand Police in 1991. They reported that approximately 12 per
cent of the people dealt with through the diversionary process
had been charged with cannabis possession ([38]Young &amp;
Cameron 1991, pp41-6). The review indicated that the scheme was
generally very well received by all the parties involved and also
pointed to existing and potential difficulties and to ways in
which it could be strengthened. The police and the Government are
currently reviewing the scheme, considering the option of giving
it a legislative base and ensuring that it operates in a similar
manner throughout the country. This diversionary scheme, combined
with an actively implemented policy of cautioning minor offenders
whenever possible (rather than charging them), comprises an
enlightened approach to the handling of minor offenders such as
cannabis users. </p>

<h2>OTHER COUNTRIES </h2>

<p> An overview of international legislation relating to
diversion, in countries covered by the World Health Organization
([39]Porter, Arif &amp; Curran 1986), indicates that many
countries provide for diversion to drug- and alcohol-dependence
treatment programs both separately and in combination, the
covering legislation falling into a variety of categories (e.g.
mental health, public health, criminal or specialised treatment
laws).16 </p>

<p> The legal disposition of drug- or alcohol-dependent persons
is frequently covered by the criminal law (e.g. under specified
statutory offence) or mental health legislation. In Victoria, for
example, treatment programs for drug and alcohol dependence
include provision for both voluntary and involuntary admission,
while other provisions governing treatment may be found in road
traffic laws and the mental health legislation (Porter, Arif
&amp; Curran 1986, pp36-37). Porter et al. emphasise the
importance of treatment as a service to the public and the
individual concerned, which should be available at every stage of
the criminal justice system. </p>

<p> Initial contact between the offender and the police can be
very important, as it may create the kind of crisis that
motivates a person to undergo effective treatment, and the police
should be 'both legally entitled and encouraged to refer the
person directly to a treatment program, in lieu of arrest, for a
short time until the emergency passes'. They claim that there are
definite advantages in including treatment provisions in drug
control legislation because of the flexibility it gives to the
courts in imposing alternatives to penal sanctions ([40]Porter,
Arif &amp; Curran 1986, p116). </p>

<p> To summarise some relevant points raised by Porter et al's
overview of international diversion legislation: 1. </p>

<ol>
    <li>Cannabis is rarely named specifically in legislation
        relating to diversion for drug users who commit offences.
        Usually the legislation refers to 'narcotics', 'opiates',
        'alcohol' or 'other drugs'. Although cannabis is usually
        not specifically singled out (as distinct from alcohol,
        for example, which is mostly treated in a special class
        of its own with specialised treatment), it falls within
        the general class of substances for which many countries
        legislate compulsory reporting and/or registration
        followed by referral into a treatment program. 2. </li>
    <li>There are many precedents among overseas countries for
        diversion and voluntary or non-voluntary commitment to
        treatment. There are also examples of such diversion
        occurring at every stage of the criminal justice process.
        3. </li>
    <li>There is a clear lack of evaluation of programs, which
        means results cannot be quantified, but the general
        impression is one of diversion to treatment being more
        acceptable all round than imprisonment without
        rehabilitation, which would otherwise be the situation in
        countries with a total prohibition policy. 4. </li>
    <li>Civil commitment appears to be common internationally,
        but in Australia legislative provisions for civil
        commitment exist only in certain States, e.g. NSW and
        Victoria. (This is discussed further under the heading
        Compulsory Treatment for Drug Offenders: Criminal Justice
        System-Initiated Treatment and Civil Commitment.) 5. </li>
    <li>There are a wide variety of legislative approaches to
        treatment and many different routes. </li>
</ol>

<p> Among the problems raised are: 1. </p>

<ol>
    <li>The different objectives (sometimes conflicting) of
        health professionals and legal practitioners, when
        diversion for treatment is involved. 2. </li>
    <li>The clear need for evaluation programs and for planning
        for these when the program is established. The importance
        is stressed of evaluating treatment programs in terms of
        the objectives stated in the legislation. It is important
        to establish realistic and concrete objectives for
        treatment in addition to the overriding goal of reducing
        morbidity and mortality. 3. </li>
    <li>With regard to compulsory treatment, it is acknowledged
        that it is in conflict with individual liberty and
        freedom of decision, and it is emphasised that the
        legislation should lay down the conditions governing
        participation in voluntary treatment programs, e.g.
        should the 'voluntary' status be ended if the client is
        not cooperating? 4. </li>
    <li>On occasions there may be legislation that is not used or
        does not work because of lack of suitable treatment
        facilities and resources. </li>
</ol>

<p> Drug diversion schemes of various types operate in overseas
countries. In France, for example, an offender who complies with
a court-determined treatment order is not liable to prosecution;
in Germany, a period of treatment can be credited against a
custodial sentence; in Massachusetts, a court-appointed diversion
scheme operates to stay court proceedings ([41]Porter 1986,
p171). In some countries, e.g. France and Italy, a person
voluntarily undergoing treatment, on completion is issued with a
certificate as evidence to protect against subsequent prosecution
for offences committed prior to treatment ([42]Leroy 1991). Of
the 51 jurisdictions surveyed by the WHO, 22 diverted persons for
treatment at one or more of these stages in the criminal justice
process: (a) instead of arrest; (b) after arrest, pending trial;
(c) after trial in lieu of imprisonment (e.g. suspended
sentence); and (d) correction with imprisonment (e.g. during
confinement or as a condition of parole) (Porter, Arif &amp;
Curran 1986, p57). </p>

<p> A major issue for legislators is whether such diversion
should be mandatory. If diversion is mandatory prior to or
instead of trial, this amounts to decriminalisation of the
offending behaviour.17 In Sweden, which allows for compulsory
commitment, there is now legislation in place criminalising drug
use and widening the powers of the authorities to take adult
alcohol and drug-dependent people into care. Sweden is a country
with a strong temperance tradition which has led to 'an obsession
with substance misuse generally'. Faced with the problem of AIDS
and with economic difficulties, a 'new moralism' has developed in
this country leading to these harsher drug measures (Gould 1989,
p731). </p>

<p> Another approach to the handling of cannabis offenders is
that taken in the United Kingdom, where more than half of the
police constabulary areas have allowed police officers to take
note of drug users found in possession of quantities of drugs
consistent with personal use. Police then have the option not to
proceed with a legal charge unless the individual has been
cautioned on more than two occasions previously ([43]Wodak 1993).
</p>

<p> A recent example of a pre-court initiative involving an
attempt to bring drug users into contact with treatment is the
'Southwark Arrest Referral Pilot Program', funded by the British
Home Office Local Drug Prevention Team. This three-year pilot
program, commenced in March 1991, is being carried out to
establish the effectiveness of arrest as an intervention for drug
users wanting help. Police provide arrestees with information on
local drug referral agencies and cards are sent to all charged
offenders. Also, drug workers are on call to visit the relevant
police stations. Though referrals were not numerous, most of
those participating in referral programs reported reduced drug
use in the following 12-month period. </p>

<p> The flaw in the program to date is the lack of effort and
encouragement on the part of the police. However, it reflects an
attempt to bring into a closer working relationship police and
local welfare agencies in a harm reduction effort rather than
simply to exercise law enforcement against drug users
([44]Walters &amp; Coventry 1993, p12). Although the British
Criminal Justice Act was proclaimed in 1991 with specific
sections relating to the treatment of drug and alcohol dependent
offenders (Criminal Justice Act 1991, s69, schedule 1, cited in
Walters and Coventry 1993, p11) and allowing for referral and
assessment procedures as components of non-custodial orders, it
does not establish diversionary programs for drug offenders. </p>

<h3>Compulsory treatment for drug users </h3>

<p> <b>CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM-INITIATED DRUG TREATMENT AND CIVIL
COMMITMENT </b> </p>

<p> A number of literature reviews have concluded that treatment
can effectively reduce drug use as well as the criminal activity
which often accompanies it ([45]Anglin &amp; Hser 1990; Gerstein
1990; Office of Technology Assessment 1990 in Anglin &amp; Hser
1991, p244). There is also increasing evidence that those coerced
into treatment by way of the criminal justice system achieve the
same success as those entering voluntarily (Anglin &amp; Hser
1991, p244). </p>

<p> The issue for makers of social policy is how to increase the
number entering treatment, since 'the nature of drug use,
especially at abusive and addictive levels, often inhibits or
precludes self-motivation in the user toward voluntarily seeking
treatment' (Anglin &amp; Hser 1991, p247). </p>

<p> Many would say that 'when offenders, such as arrestees,
probationers, inmates or parolees, are identified as substance
abusers by the criminal justice system, remanding to treatment is
a necessary and logical action ... One of the most successful of
coercive efforts has been civil commitment' (Anglin &amp; Hser
1991, p247; see also discussion below of countries which employ
civil commitment). Carney, in his Drug Users and the Law in
Australia (1987), points out that, in Australia, civil commitment
policies for drug-dependent people date back to the 19th century,
and were based on the early view of drug use as a 'disease' for
which in-patient therapy should be compulsory (1987, p1). </p>

<p> As early as 1867, Victoria copied Scotland's move to amend
its lunacy laws to allow inebriates to be admitted to 'lunatic
asylums', and in 1872 passed the Victorian Inebriates Act, which
was the first comprehensive Inebriates Act to be enacted outside
America. The other Australian States followed, with legislation
in Tasmania in 1873, in South Australia in 1874, in Queensland in
1898, in New South Wales in 1900 and in Western Australia in 1903
(1987, p3). Much of the Australian State legislation has survived
to the present time. When Queensland was debating its legislation
in 1896, the subject of drugs other than alcohol, i.e. 'opium,
chloral and other drugs', came up for the first time (1987, p13).
Legislation providing for voluntary or compulsory civil admission
to treatment facilities of alcohol or drug-dependent people is in
force in most of the major Australian jurisdictions - but is not
much utilised. Carney (1987, pp52-53) outlines four approaches to
the regulation of entry to civil treatment schemes for dependent
drug users - the fourth 'applies the classic justifications for
the enactment of criminal law, namely that the actions of the
prospective patient constitutes an intolerable degree of harm to
other members of the community. Judicial commitment of offenders,
and some third party proceedings initiated by police officers,
fit this model' (1987, p53). </p>

<p> Moving to the United States, the origins of 'civil
commitment' for opiate-dependent (and also alcohol-dependent)
people date back to the second half of the 19th century when some
of the laws enacted to provide for the civil commitment of the
mentally ill also permitted civil commitment of people dependent
on narcotics ([46]Rosenthal 1988). In the United States civil
commitment generally takes the form, described by [47]Brown
(1988, p664), of the direct remanding of the individual to the
health care system in which civil procedures alone are brought
into play ... This administrative/judicial action need not
involve provision of legal counsel, the potential for judgment by
one's peers, access to witnesses for one's defense, etc. </p>

<p> With some exceptions (see Newman 1986, cited in [48]Brown
1988), diversion from the criminal justice system for drug
treatment seems to be acceptable to both health and criminal
justice authorities. However, in democratic countries, civil
commitment of the drug user conflicts with many people's views
regarding civil rights, the proper relationship of the individual
to the State and the use of the health care system for social
control. Regardless, legislation in a number of countries
provides for such civil commitment for drug use. [49]Porter et
al. (1986) point out that in 27 (comprising 32 separate
jurisdictions) of the countries they surveyed, there was
provision for civil commitment under certain conditions, as there
are in 35 American States. </p>

<p> It has been argued (Bejerot 1983 &amp; Webster 1986, cited in
Brown 1988) that such extreme measures to deal with drug use must
have wide public support. Generally the rationale for such action
is that drug use is a threat to the country's stability (as in
Singapore in the case of heroin dependence among young males) or
a threat to the country achieving its economic goals, e.g.
Malaysia, where the Government decided that the drug problem was
a threat to national security as the country was 'losing its
manpower to drugs' ([50]Rysavy 1990).18 </p>

<p> In 1983, due to an increasing heroin problem in Malaysia, the
powers of police and drug rehabilitation officers were extended,
allowing them to arrest and detain persons suspected of using
illegal substances. A positive urine sample resulted in mandatory
drug treatment. Ten per cent of those in treatment in 1989 were
undertaking rehabilitation for cannabis use only. All programs
were the same, lasting a maximum of two years with two years'
compulsory aftercare, an important part of which was the
assignment of a drug-free 'guardian' to act as a role model and
to provide positive support. Any infringement of rules during
treatment resulted in severe punishment, and any drug use after
release from treatment resulted in incarceration (Rysavy 1990).
Needless to say the program has a high success rate, but is
unlikely to fit other countries with cultures differing from that
of Malaysia. </p>

<p> Brown summarises the conditions that 'on the basis of other
societies' actions, have been described as necessary to the
implementation of civil commitment procedures: </p>

<ul>
    <li>there needs to be the appearance of risk to the larger
        society through the subgroup's (i.e. drug users')
        inappropriate behaviours; </li>
    <li>there needs to be the capacity to marshal public support
        for such action; </li>
    <li>there must be a capacity to identify and isolate the
        subgroup demonstrating the offending behaviour; </li>
    <li>the subgroup must be without sufficient political support
        to withstand the competing political pressure; </li>
    <li>there must be the machinery to process, detain and
        confine those whose behaviour is inappropriate or
        threatening; and </li>
    <li>there should be a belief in the ability of the community
        to put in place initiatives that will humanely change
        individuals' behaviour for their own and for the larger
        society's well-being ([51]Brown 1988, p676). </li>
</ul>

<p> Brown goes on to say that it is likely that jurisdictions
will retain the option to call upon civil commitment in the event
of a situation arising which has the capacity to 'disrupt the
normal course of society and for which criminal prosecution may
be seen as either inappropriate, unwarranted or infeasible'. At
the same time, only with the greatest conservatism will civil
commitment be likely to be employed, due to a general distaste
for such emergency measures ([52]Brown 1988). The contribution to
the spread of AIDS of intravenous drug use, and its repercussions
for individual drug users and the wider society, is potentially
one such situation. </p>

<p> Throughout the wide variety of countries providing for civil
commitment for drug use, there have been few studies of the
efficacy of such treatment ([53]Brown 1988). However, some
studies have been produced by the US and these are discussed
below. Generally, in the majority of countries, grounds for
commitment are provided either in mental health legislation or
specific drug legislation. Countries using mental health
legislation usually include provision for commitment for threats
both to others and to self. Germany, Japan and Somalia, for
example, provide for civil commitment if the drug-related
disorder 'constitutes an imminent threat to public safety, or
when individuals pose a danger to their own life and health'
([54]Brown 1988, p666). Bangladesh, on the other hand, specifies
only the existence of psychiatric disturbance without elaboration
of threat, and Trinidad and Tobago emphasise the individual's
inability to provide for himself (Brown 1988). Fifteen out of 43
countries surveyed by [55]Porter et al (1986) provide for civil
commitment under legislation specific to drug use, where the
criteria may be limited to evidence of dependence (as in Mexico,
Columbia, Peru, Thailand and Malaysia). Some (i.e. Argentina,
Italy, Australia and Sweden) also include reference to the threat
posed to others and/or to the need for treatment. In Victoria
(Australia) under the Alcoholics and Drug Dependent Persons Act
of 18 December 1968, an alcohol- or drug-dependent person
'suitable for treatment' (i.e. 'who habitually uses drugs of
addiction to such an extent that he has lost the power of
self-control with respect to the use of drugs of addiction'
(Porter et al 1986, p126), may be committed for seven days and,
at the discretion of the medical officer in charge of the
assessment centre (the decision-making authority), for another
seven days. </p>

<p> A consensus statement issued by the participants at a meeting
in the US to examine research findings relating to civil
commitment and mandatory treatment, particularly in relation to
hindering the spread of AIDS, found that 'treatment is effective
in reducing intravenous drug abuse and that the length of time in
treatment is positively related to treatment success, the
criminal justice system is important for identification and
retention of drug abusers in treatment' ([56]Leukefeld &amp; Tims
1988). It was further recommended at this meeting that 'the term
&quot;compulsory treatment&quot; be used rather than &quot;civil
commitment&quot; to capture a wider range of possible
interventions, since civil commitment is only one type of
compulsory treatment. Further, it is essential that candidates
for compulsory treatment receive appropriate legal protections.'
In the US, despite interest in the early 1970s due to 'high rates
of recidivism and criminal justice system over-crowding and the
shift away from a rehabilitative philosophy in corrections,
programs for drug-abusing offenders have languished in the 1980s
until fairly recently' ([57]Anglin and Hser 1990, p424). </p>

<p> However, the 1960s saw the beginning of civil commitment for
drug-abusing offenders in some States of the US. These were based
on the therapeutic community philosophy. There are few
evaluations of treatment for offenders except for these civil
commitment programs, and such programs as have been developed are
so recent that they have not been evaluated. </p>

<h4>CIVIL COMMITMENT IN THE US </h4>

<p> Compulsory treatment of drug users has been a controversial
issue worldwide for decades. In response to two forces, one aimed
at more effective treatment of problem drug users and the other
at social control of the problem user, civil commitment
legislation was enacted in the US in the 1960s and 1970s
([58]Rosenthal 1988). </p>

<p> Following this, three major treatment programs were
established: the California Civil Addict Program, the New York
Civil Commitment Program and programs under the federal Narcotic
Addict Rehabilitation Act (NARA) ([59]Anglin &amp; Hser 1990,
p425), enabling large-scale commitment of drug-dependent people.
However, relatively few persons were committed under the
Massachusetts law, one of the earliest in the country, and
despite civil commitment laws in many other jurisdictions they
remained only statutes on the books (Rosenthal 1988). </p>

<p> Since involuntary civil commitment involves a substantial
deprivation of liberty, various aspects of the California and New
York programs were challenged quite early - the federal program
for involuntary civil commitment of drug users not charged with a
crime was not challenged in this way, presumably because the
federal program permitted only relatives to initiate commitment,
and few relatives did. Despite challenges to the
constitutionality of involuntary treatment, the Californian and
New York courts held in its favour. They were, however,
influenced by the Supreme Court case of Robinson v. California
which did not really involve the constitutionality of involuntary
commitment at all but rather the question of whether it was
constitutional for a State to make 'addiction' a crime:
'Nevertheless, the Supreme Court declared (in a dictum) that a
State might establish a program of compulsory treatment for
opiate addicts either to discourage violation of its criminal
laws against narcotic trafficking or to safeguard the general
health or welfare of its inhabitants' ([60]Rosenthal 1988, p641).
</p>

<p> It has been suggested that because this case did not involve
the constitutionality of involuntary treatment of opiate users,
the Supreme Court did not go into that question as deeply as it
might have and, in turn, the California and New York courts
relied too much on the Supreme Court dictum without delving
deeply enough into the question. The Supreme Court decision
therefore meant almost inevitably that in future cases the
substantive validity of involuntary civil commitment would be
upheld (Rosenthal 1988, p643). </p>

<p> Under the legislation discussed here anyone found in a
medical examination to be dependent on drugs (usually heroin)
could be committed. Mostly those committed had been arrested for
property crimes or drug trafficking and were diverted from the
usual criminal processing. Usually there were two phases of
treatment, initially one of imprisonment, plus a period of parole
or monitored community release. During both phases the goal was
reduced drug use and criminal behaviour; vocational training was
sometimes added. </p>

<p> The California Civil Addict Program was more successful than
the New York State program, primarily due to better management.
The main results of evaluations were that program participants
reduced 'narcotic use and associated property crime' to one-third
compared with those not in the program ([61]Lindblad 1988).
Overall, studies of the California CAP concluded that civil
commitment and other drug treatment programs, particularly
methadone maintenance, were effective in reducing narcotics
dependence and minimising the associated adverse social effects,
the important issue being that the dependence should be brought
into an environment where intervention can occur over time. </p>

<p> In this respect, civil commitment and other legally coercive
measures were found to be useful where the dependent person would
not enter treatment voluntarily ([62]Anglin 1988a). A vital issue
is the implementation strategy employed, which can 'ensure or
sabotage success' (Anglin 1988a, p539). Although NARA was a
comparatively short-lived program superseded by other
legislation, it provided a national network of treatment
providers and was regarded as an effective way of bringing
narcotic dependent people into treatment. NARA allowed treatment
for offenders as a pre-trial civil commitment, rather than
prosecution for drug-dependent people convicted of a specific
crime and for voluntary applicants. Those admitted to the program
did as well or better than those in other programs (Lindblad
1988). </p>

<h4>TASC PROGRAMS IN THE US </h4>

<p> More recently in the US, coordinated programs have been
developed in a number of States to refer 'drug-abusing offenders
to community-based treatment in lieu of prosecution or probation
revocation', e.g. the Treatment Alternatives to Street Crime
(TASC) program ([63]Anglin &amp; Hser 1990, p428), begun in 1972
and by 1988 operating in 18 States (Cook et al. 1988 in Anglin
&amp; Hser 1990, p428). This provides community-based treatment
for drug-dependent offenders who 'otherwise might become
progressively more involved with the criminal justice system'
(p428). Diversionary dispositions such as deferred prosecution,
creative community sentencing, and pretrial intervention are used
to motivate offenders to enter and remain in treatment.
Evaluation Such limited evaluation as has taken place (through
the Treatment Outcomes Prospective Study) indicates that criminal
justice referred clients, because they were monitored, tended to
stay in treatment longer than voluntary clients, which is usually
associated with more successful treatment outcomes ([64]Anglin
&amp; Hser 1990, p429). </p>

<p> Although evaluations of treatment are positive, it remains a
question as to whether improvements would have occurred over time
anyway due to maturation or other outside influences. In terms of
client characteristics and treatment effectiveness, it was found
that 'addicts who have a more stable family background, an intact
marriage, a job, a history of minimal criminality, less evidence
of alcohol or polydrug abuse, and less severe psychiatric
disorders are more likely to achieve a better outcome in most
programs' (Anglin &amp; Hser 1990, p429). </p>

<p> Many studies have shown that, while older clients, mostly
opiate users, tend to stay in treatment longer and therefore
benefit most (possibly due to the 'maturing out' effect noted by
Winick (1962 in Anglin &amp; Hser 1990, p435), those under 25
tend to leave treatment prematurely, thus limiting their
prospects for effective results. In terms of program factors
which appeared to be most beneficial, the significant ones were:
psychotherapy, urine testing, and legal coercion. 'Clients
referred from the criminal justice system have been shown to stay
in treatment longer than other clients' (Collins et al., cited in
[65]Leukefeld &amp; Timms 1988, p57) and longer retention
suggests better treatment outcomes than with other clients (but
see above). </p>

<p> Some argue that treatment cannot be effective if the client
is coerced, and the findings are not consistent on this issue.
However, the best-designed studies 'generally support the
proposition that a collaborative relationship between the
criminal justice system and community-treatment delivery systems
produces, at an aggregate level, enhanced treatment outcomes'
([66]Anglin &amp; Hser 1990, p439). While length of retention in
treatment is an important predictor of success it appears that
'for many drug abusers, repeated exposure to treatment is more
effective than one episode' (McLellan &amp; Druley 1977 in Anglin
&amp; Hser 1990, p441). </p>

<p> Total time in treatment may be more important, when accrued
across treatment episodes, than retention in a single program
(p441). In a number of other countries, any illegal drug use
including that of cannabis is sufficient grounds for recommending
or ordering treatment, implying that some other countries regard
cannabis use more seriously than Australia does, and deserving of
treatment. The mode of treatment depends on the profile of the
individual user and on such factors as are mentioned elsewhere in
this report, e.g. whether the person is a polydrug user, length
of time of use, degree of psychopathology and so forth.
Outpatient non-methadone programs which involve clients with all
types of drug use who tend not to have serious criminal
histories, are the most obvious option for treatment of cannabis
dependence. Therapeutic communities are not necessarily specific
to any class of drug and could also therefore potentially be of
benefit to certain cannabis-dependent persons. </p>

<p> Since the numbers of cannabis users who have problems is
still small and very few are likely to be seriously enough
dependent to be referred by the court, it is unlikely that
treatment facilities could not incorporate them. </p>

<h2>Summary of findings </h2>

<p> A summary of findings from Australian and international
literature concerned with diversion and treatment for drug
offenders suggests the following conclusions with relation to
cannabis users: </p>

<ul>
    <li>While the vast majority of cannabis users do not report
        any problems, there are increasing reports of individuals
        both in Australia and in other countries (e.g. the United
        States and New Zealand) who are seeking treatment for
        cannabis dependence. </li>
    <li>It is generally accepted that a prison sentence is
        unsatisfactory for offenders with drug problems, and
        diversion with the purpose of treatment is a widely used
        alternative, welcomed by judges and magistrates. Usually
        the illegal drug involved is heroin but occasionally
        cannabis is the offender's primary drug. </li>
    <li>Criminal justice involvement is seen as providing an
        opportunity to intervene in drug users' lives in order to
        confront the users with their drug problems and to bring
        them into contact with treatment agencies, often for the
        first time. </li>
    <li>The earlier the intervention in the users' lives the
        better, and the longer (or more frequent) the periods of
        treatment, the more successful the treatment outcome. </li>
    <li>In some cases merely attending for assessment is
        sufficient to bring about a change in attitude since the
        users are often confronted with their drug problem for
        the first time. </li>
    <li>While some dispute the value of coercion in getting drug
        users into treatment, it is often the only way, and there
        is more evidence to indicate successful treatment results
        for involuntary than for voluntary clients. This is
        primarily due to the length of time spent in treatment.
        Frequently the attitude of an unwilling client will
        change quite quickly once treatment has begun. </li>
    <li>The success of diversion to treatment programs depends on
        the skill and experience of the drug counsellor, the
        availability of sufficient places in suitable treatment
        facilities, and close cooperation between health and
        criminal justice agencies. </li>
    <li>It would be more cost effective to provide additional
        funds for the training of counsellors and the provision
        of suitable facilities than to continue to send repeat
        drug offenders to prison. </li>
    <li>Conclusions regarding treatment for cannabis offenders,
        particularly repeat offenders, are as follows: </li>
    <li>There are reports from most diversion programs/treatment
        agencies of individuals being referred for other drug use
        who also have serious problems in reducing or ceasing
        their cannabis use. Some of these may also be
        alcohol-dependent. There appears then to be some demand
        for cannabis treatment in this country. </li>
    <li>Interpreting treatment in its broadest and most ideal
        sense (i.e. as a program personally selected by the
        client in consultation with a counsellor, tailored to the
        needs and characteristics of the particular individual),
        for a repeat offender facing a prison sentence, treatment
        is a preferable alternative. Treatment appears to have
        the potential to help offenders restructure their lives
        in such a way as to avoid breaches of the law which bring
        them continually into contact with the criminal justice
        system. In the sense that treatment may be 'compulsory'
        (i.e. court mandated), while the client must be assessed
        as suitable for treatment (genuinely motivated to
        participate, although there may be some initial
        resistance), the advantage of the compulsory nature of
        the treatment is that it provides the 'crisis' generally
        acknowledged as necessary to get most drug users into
        treatment and to keep them there long enough for a
        successful outcome. In the case of cannabis use, the
        earlier the intervention the better, since there is
        likely to be less criminal involvement and therefore more
        likelihood of a successful outcome for the client. Young
        users, particularly juveniles, should receive more
        attention than they appear to be getting at present in
        Australia from, for instance, juvenile 'panels' (such as
        those in South Australia) for whom this is not a major
        focus. </li>
    <li>A final consideration regarding the treatment option for
        cannabis users is the availability of treatment programs
        and facilities and counsellors of sufficient quality and
        in sufficient numbers to accommodate those referred from
        the court system, since this is vital for successful
        treatment outcomes. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion </h2>

<p> In this chapter we have discussed the two related fields of
diversion and treatment for drug offenders. We believe that few
people would disagree with the wisdom of diversion from the
criminal justice system for minor cannabis offenders. Further,
though some would object that treatment of drug offenders is a
form of social control and that the concept of the 'need for
treatment' has no inherent limitation, the evidence suggests
that, although methodological problems exist in the evaluation of
treatment programs, most of the programs outlined here have
achieved a certain level of success in terms of meeting their
objectives - which generally means, in the Australian context,
reducing the drug use, and associated involvement with the
criminal justice system, of the individual undergoing treatment. </p>

<p> Disagreement arises regarding the degree of intervention
which should be exercised by the criminal justice system, as an
agent of the State, in coercing drug offenders into treatment -
in its most extreme form, through civil commitment. While the
United States, for example, indicates considerable support for
civil commitment, in Australia, although commitment exists as a
legislative option, there has been reluctance to use it. This
decision with respect to the balance between protecting society
and infringing the rights of individuals is a matter for the
particular society involved and the prevailing mores at the time.

<p> The principle of evaluating new policy and legislation is
widely accepted, but is less frequently observed in practice. In
Australia and most Western nations, little has been done,
especially by government agencies, to monitor and evaluate, in a
systematic manner, their national drug policies. This is the case
in instances where legislation has developed incrementally (as in
most of Australia's States and Territories) and where new
approaches have been implemented following detailed policy
reviews (e.g. the Australian Capital Territory's cannabis
expiation notice initiative). Too often evaluation is considered
relevant only after a policy has been in place for some time and
changes are being considered. </p>

<p> To be of most value, new initiatives should be designed and
implemented with an explicit and adequately resourced monitoring
and evaluation component built into the initiative from the
outset. In the context of evaluating new legislative approaches
to cannabis, we suggest that policy evaluation and program
evaluation be considered separately. The bulk of this paper has
addressed the evaluation of policies, as reflected through
legislative options. The details of evaluating the implementation
of policies, focusing on the programs themselves, are matters
which need to be addressed after the broad policy issues are
settled and particular new approaches are agreed upon. </p>

<p> We provide below an overview of the steps involved in both
evaluative tasks. The National Drug Strategic Plan 1993-97
(Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy 1993) provides the
framework within which we base our recommendations relating to
monitoring and evaluation. The Plan is explicitly goal-attainment
focused, the approach that we argued for in [1]<a
href="can_ch2.html">Chapter 2</a>, where we highlighted the
importance of clarity in the specification of the goals of drug
policy, legislation and program implementation. The Plan provides
an overarching goal (or 'mission') for Australian drug policy:
'The overall mission of the National Drug Strategy is to minimise
the harmful effects of drugs and drug use in Australian society'
(MCDS 1993, p6). </p>

<p> Policies and programs in specific areas, including cannabis,
should be evaluated in a manner consistent with this national
goal. Applying goal attainment models of evaluation is a more
complex task than it sometimes seems to be initially. Substantial
technical difficulties exist in both designing and conducting
evaluation research; part of this is the often complex task of
identifying policy and program goals. </p>

<p> Our discussion in [2]<a href="can_ch2.html">Chapter 2</a>
referred to the fact that, in practice, a particular cannabis
policy can relate to goals which are inconsistent: the attainment
of one may militate against the attainment of another. Needs
change over time; often policy and legislation are far behind.
For a given policy, it is likely that a hierarchy of goals will
exist: the mission statement of the National Drug Strategic Plan
is an overarching goal, one which must be articulated in terms
which encompass other goals such as those concerned specifically
with cannabis. Policy evaluation and decision-making </p>

<p> In [3]<a href="can_ch4.html">Chapter 4</a> we outlined five
broad policy and legislative options for cannabis in Australia.
The approach taken there is a contribution to policy evaluation
in this area, and, by extension, a contribution to
decision-making. But how are decisions about drug policy to be
made? </p>

<p> One approach is the making of ad hoc decisions. This must be
rejected in favour of more systematic policy choice models. The
literature differentiates two groups of decision-making models
for use by governments: 'rational' and 'incremental' approaches
(see, e.g. Corbett 1992, pp59-76; Davis et al.1993, pp157-81).
The rational approach, illustrated below, is something of an
ideal. It is not always easy to implement in practice, but the
alternative (making decisions incrementally without ever
reconsidering the overall needs and patterns of policy responses)
is much less attractive. Applying a rational approach to
decision-making in evaluating new legislative approaches to
cannabis use (as different from evaluating the actual
implementation of new legislation and resulting programs), we
suggest that the following issues be taken into account: </p>

<ol>
    <li>The need to examine the sources of the proposal and the
        context within which it has been presented. </li>
    <li>The need to clarify just why that approach (rather than a
        different one) is proposed. </li>
    <li>The need to identify the goals which the new approach, if
        implemented, would attain. The philosophical and
        pragmatic goals should both be specified. Multiple goals
        may be identified and inconsistencies between them made
        explicit. </li>
    <li>The need to assess the likely impacts on key
        stakeholders, if the approach were to be implemented. For
        each key stakeholder, assess the likely costs and
        benefits, both intended and unintended. </li>
    <li>The need to review the depth, breadth, relevance and
        quality of the data currently available to assist the
        evaluation of the proposed approach. Determine whether or
        not it is, in fact, feasible to reach a conclusion on the
        value of the proposed policy, given the availability of
        data to answer questions about the proposal's likely
        outcomes and impacts. </li>
    <li>The need to make judgments regarding: (a) the value of
        the goal or goals; (b) how achievable the goals are; and
        (c) if the goals are judged to be achievable, how
        effective, efficient and appropriate are the
        implementation programs. </li>
</ol>

<p> This systematic approach to policy evaluation is not often
seen in the development of drugs policy. Nevertheless, in the
area of legislative options for cannabis in Australia, policy
makers have the capacity to apply such a process. This should be
undertaken as part of the National Drug Strategic Plan's project
to develop a national statement on cannabis, one which includes a
contemporary perspective on the most appropriate legislative
option or options for cannabis. Program evaluation It is beyond
the scope of this report to present details on the techniques of
program evaluation. These are to be found in standard textbooks
(Brinkerhoff et al. 1983; Hawe et al. 1991; Guba &amp; Lincoln
1989; Morris 1987; Patton 1990; Rossi &amp; Freeman 1989). </p>

<p> One point to be made, however, is that the evaluation
research model and techniques employed should be selected on the
basis of answering a precisely defined evaluation question. If
the evaluation question is, for example, 'What has been the
impact on policing of a new legislative approach to cannabis',
quite different evaluation techniques will be used from a
situation where the evaluation question is 'How cost-effective
has the new approach been', or 'How relevant is current
legislation to contemporary needs?'. No single approach covers
all circumstances. </p>

<p> Again, the National Drug Strategic Plan emphasises the
importance of monitoring and evaluation. Under the heading
'Policy Approach', it states: The National Drug Strategic Plan
explicitly identifies policy objectives and indicators to enable
the effectiveness of the program to be evaluated. The National
Drug Strategic Plan is committed to the application of
needs-based planning and evaluation activities to ensure the
effectiveness and efficiency of strategies employed to minimise
drug-related harm (MCDS 1993, p5). We commend those responsible
for this emphasis, but note that this policy cannot be
implemented without the allocation of a significant level of
resources. The oft-stated policy that evaluation should be an
integral part of all drug-related programs can only be realised
if program budgets include sufficient funds to cover the design
and conduct of monitoring and evaluation, and if reporting time
frames are appropriate to the evaluation model being employed.
Indicators A related strength of the National Drug Strategic Plan
which is highly relevant to the present review is its focus on
indicators of program implementation, short-term outcomes and
longer-term and broader impacts. The indicators selected for this
purpose will depend on the particular initiative being evaluated;
accordingly, they cannot be comprehensively described here.
Within Australia, the work of Sarre, Sutton and Pulsford (1989)
and of Christie (1991) in evaluating the South Australian
cannabis expiation notice scheme, and of the Queensland Criminal
Justice Commission's Advisory Committee on Illicit Drugs (1993)
are examples of the effective use of indicators in the monitoring
and evaluation of cannabis legislation. Single's (1989) review of
the USA experience of marijuana 'decriminalisation' demonstrates
the dearth of information available in that country to evaluate
the legislative changes initiated over the last 20 years.
Elsewhere in this paper we have referred to such evaluation data
as are available relating to other nations. Without seeking to be
exhaustive, we list here some examples of indicators which are
significant inputs to policy and program evaluation relating to
new legislative initiatives concerned with cannabis: </p>

<ul>
    <li>The impact on social justice in Australian society of the
        implementation of cannabis legislation. </li>
    <li>Costs of cannabis controls, including the transfer of
        resources. </li>
    <li>The effectiveness and efficiency of the implementation of
        policies and legislation. </li>
    <li>Public opinion concerning cannabis. </li>
    <li>Cannabis consumption patterns and levels. </li>
    <li>Numbers and characteristics of the people presenting to
        treatment agencies with cannabis-related health and
        social problems. </li>
    <li>Cannabis-related offences. </li>
    <li>Cannabis-related driving and motor vehicle crashes. </li>
    <li>THC levels of the cannabis available to consumers. </li>
    <li>Cannabis-related workplace accidents. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion </h2>

<p> In this section we have discussed the evaluation of new
legislative approaches to cannabis use in Australia. We have
differentiated between policy evaluation and program evaluation,
and have pointed to the need to develop indicators, tied to
specific initiatives, of activities, outcomes and impacts.
Undertaking high quality, systematic policy evaluation concerning
cannabis is essential and this paper contributes to that process.
Research aimed at developing evaluation techniques and program
indicators will be needed as part of the development and
implementation of new legislative approaches in this area. </p>

<h1>Chapter 7. Conclusion </h1>

<h1><img src="../../../graphics/blueline.GIF"><br>
</h1>

<p> This paper has addressed the legislative options available
for cannabis in Australia, and has argued that choosing from
among these options requires a process of policy evaluation.
Accordingly, the paper first considered the policy frameworks
within which decision-making occurs, emphasising the necessity
for clarity in the goals that society seeks to attain through
legislating in this area. </p>

<p> The paper places contemporary Australian cannabis legislation
within its broader context: historical and international. Despite
the work of numerous Royal Commissions and other official
inquiries, much of Australia's legislation concerning cannabis
reflects the dynamics of earlier times, when Australia tended to
mimic other nations' policies without taking sufficient account
of local circumstances. Our framework of legislative prohibition
was put in place at a time when there was virtually no cannabis
use in Australia. In the 1990s, when over four million
Australians report having used the drug and nearly half of them
report having done so during the last year, most jurisdictions
maintain total prohibition as their legislative stance, even
though only a tiny proportion of the offenders against their
legislation will ever be prosecuted. </p>

<p> We have reviewed the range of legislative options available,
classifying them as: total prohibition; prohibition combined with
a civil penalty for personal use, etc; partial prohibition
whereby personal use, etc., is not an offence, but trafficking
and large-scale growing of cannabis remains prohibited; the legal
availability of cannabis under various forms of regulation; and,
finally, the option of unregulated, free availability. Each of
these options is reviewed in terms of its rationale, experiences
with it to date and its impacts. </p>

<p> The related topics of the diversion from the criminal justice
system of people who come to the attention of the police for
cannabis offences, and the compulsory treatment of cannabis
users, have also been discussed. Experience to date suggests that
well-resourced and managed diversionary programs can be
effective, and desirable, alternatives to imprisonment for some
offenders. Very few cannabis users will need treatment, as
conceived of through a medical model, simply because of their
cannabis use. Many users can benefit, however, from a helping
intervention, the success of which may be potentiated by the
crisis of a 'bust' for cannabis use or related offences. </p>

<p> Cannabis is used mainly as a recreational drug and this
pattern of use has been the focus of this paper. For
completeness, we have included in the appendixes information on
the medical and industrial/agricultural uses of the cannabis
plant and its by-products. In doing so, we remind readers that,
in drug policies, we are not faced with 'all-or-nothing' choices.
Within the range of available policy options lies the possibility
of prohibiting the recreational use of cannabis while permitting
its use for other purposes. (This occurs, of course, with
opiates: the opium poppy is grown in Tasmania to provide raw
material for the manufacture of pharmaceutical products.) </p>

<p> Australia's National Drug Strategy provides a policy
framework within which new legislative approaches may be
developed. Both existing and new approaches have the possibility
of both enhancing and detracting from the achievement of the
mission of the National Drug Strategy, that of minimising the
harmful effects of drugs and drug use in Australian society. Our
review of the policy options, set out in <a href="can_ch4.htm">Chapter
4</a>, demonstrates this. </p>

<p> No single 'best option' for cannabis legislation exists. What
is most appropriate will depend upon what goals both policy
makers and the community are seeking to achieve. It is not the
role of researchers to dictate policy goals; rather we have drawn
attention to their importance, outlined an approach to evaluating
them and described the likely outcomes, in terms of policy goals,
of the five broad categories of legislative options which are
available now. </p>

<p> Our review suggests that two of the five legislative options
discussed in <a href="can_ch4.htm">Chapter 4</a> are
inappropriate in contemporary Australian circumstances. They are
the options which we have characterised as 'total prohibition'
and 'free availability'. The arguments for rejecting these
options will not be repeated here as they are detailed in <a
href="can_ch4.htm">Chapter 4</a>. </p>

<p> We point out, however, that the cultivation, possession and
supply of cannabis remain an offence in all Australian States and
Territories (and using it is an offence in most), even though
cannabis use is commonplace and little evidence exists that
cannabis itself causes significant harm when used in small
quantities. Australian society experiences more harm, we
conclude, from maintaining the prohibition policy than it
experiences from the use of the drug. </p>

<p> Widespread interest exists in the Dutch approach to drug
policies. We have categorised them, in this paper, under the
heading of total prohibition, as that is the Dutch legislative
position. However, as detailed above, the application of the
principle that it is, in their terms, 'inexpedient' to prosecute
people for minor drug offences (including selling cannabis in
certain coffee shops) means that Dutch policy and practice (as
contrasted to legislation) is closer to the regulatory option
than the total prohibition option. The regulatory option is one
of the approaches which we suggest is more appropriate to
Australian circumstances than is total prohibition. </p>

<p> It could be argued that the Dutch approach is a product of a
different culture and system of administration of criminal
justice. If the Australian States and Territories resolve not to
arrest and proceed against people using, possessing or supplying
cannabis, by far the best approach is for this policy to be
implemented through legislation, rather than through an
administrative decision not to prosecute cannabis offenders. This
is because the Australian system of legal justice is based upon
the principle of legal clarity and consistency in the
implementation of the law. </p>

<p> Nevertheless, the reality is that, for a variety of reasons,
Australian governments may well prefer to implement the Dutch
approach. A number of precedents exist whereby, especially in
areas of moral contention, certain illegal activities, as a
matter of policy, are excluded from the purview of the criminal
justice authorities. In the Australian Capital Territory, for
example, we understand that the Director of Public Prosecutions
publicly announced that he would not conduct any prosecutions in
the area of prostitution. Abortion and certain types of gambling
(e.g. playing two-up on ANZAC Day) are or were similarly dealt
with. Police general orders frequently remind officers of the
desirability of exercising their discretion not to arrest or
summons a person found committing only a minor offence. Warnings,
formal cautions and referral to other agencies are encouraged
despite the existence of legislation prohibiting the behaviour
involved. </p>

<p> We suggest, then, that if governments agree that total
prohibition is not the most desirable approach, but are unwilling
or unable to legislate to enable a more preferable option to be
implemented, then the Dutch approach is a desirable alternative.
It would entail the government, the State/Territory Director of
Public Prosecutions, or another appropriate authority declaring
that, as from a certain date, no person would be prosecuted
before the courts for specified (minor) cannabis offences. We
suggest that this is a legitimate, but not optimal, pragmatic
option currently available to Australian governments. </p>

<p> We also reject the legislative option found at the opposite
end of the continuum from total prohibition, the totally
unregulated, free availability of cannabis. Our society is one
which accepts that governments and others have both the right and
the responsibility to intervene in diverse ways to protect people
from harm and to advance the common good. It would be
unreasonable, we suggest, to argue that cannabis should be
available in an uncontrolled manner: issues of quality control,
protection of the young, road safety, etc., demand at least some
degree of control over the drug's availability. </p>

<p> We conclude, then, that cannabis law reform is required in
this country. Numerous options for policy, legislation and
implementation processes exist within the broad categories of
prohibition with civil penalties, partial prohibition and
relatively free but regulated availability. We believe, on the
basis of the available evidence, that widely acceptable social
goals, well attuned to the needs of contemporary Australian
society, will be attained through the adoption and implementation
of policies which lie within these options. </p>

<p><b>APPENDIX 1. </b></p>

<h1>THE MEDICINAL USE OF CANNABIS (19) </h1>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The medicinal use of cannabis in the ancient world has been
well documented (Abel 1980). In the United States, cannabis was
first mentioned as a medicinal drug in 1843 and by 1852 it was
included in the US dispensatory list of medicines. It was thought
to be beneficial in the treatment of 'neuralgia, gout, tetanus,
hydrophobia, cholera, convulsions, chorea, hysteria, depression
and insanity' (Wood &amp; Bache 1854, cited in [1]Abel 1980,
p182). In Australia, tincture of cannabis was used in medicine
until the 1960s, when it was declared a prohibited drug
([2]Cartwright 1983). </p>

<p>Since the introduction of legislation prohibiting the
recreational use of cannabis, its use for medicinal purposes has,
in most Western countries, not been popular. However, recently
the therapeutic benefits of cannabis have received close
attention in the United States. In 1991, Doblin and Kleiman
conducted an anonymous survey of the members of the American
Society of Clinical Oncology measuring the attitudes and
experiences of American oncologists concerning the use of
cannabis to treat nausea in cancer chemotherapy patients. They
found that, of those oncologists who replied to the survey (43
per cent), more than 44 per cent of them reported recommending
the illegal use of cannabis for the control of nausea to at least
one cancer patient. Some 48 per cent said that they would
prescribe cannabis to some of their patients if it were legal
([3]Doblin &amp; Kleiman 1991). </p>

<p>Cannabis has been used as an anti-emetic in the treatment of
AIDS patients and as a painkiller for those suffering from
chronic pain ([4]Grinspoon 1991). It has also been regarded by
some medical practitioners as being effective in reducing
intra-ocular pressure in glaucoma patients ([5]Caswell 1992) and
in treating epilepsy ([6]Cartwright 1983), Huntington's chorea
([7]Moss et al. 1989) and Parkinsonian tremor ([8]Frankel et al.
1990). </p>

<p>Despite the attention that the medical use of cannabis has
received in recent times, legislation in the United States does
not permit the medical use of marijuana. In the Federal
Controlled Substances Act, cannabis is categorised as a Schedule
1 drug, and as such is described as having a high potential for
abuse, no currently accepted medical use and no acceptable safe
level of use under medical supervision. </p>

<p>In 1989, organisations such as the (US) National Organization
for Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), the Alliance for Cannabis
Therapeutics (ACT) as well as various individuals,20 applied to
have cannabis rescheduled so that it could be used for medical
purposes. The Administrator of the Drug Enforcement
Administration rejected these claims and stated that: </p>

<p>It is clear that cannabis cannot meet the criteria ... for
safety under medical supervision. The chemistry of cannabis is
not known and reproducible. The record supports a finding that
marijuana plant material is variable from plant to plant. The
quantities of the active constituents, the cannabinoids, vary
considerably. In addition, the actions and potential risks of
several of the cannabinoids have not been studied ... (US
Government, Federal Register, vol. 54, no. 249, 29 December 1989,
p53,734). </p>

<p>This position has recently been restated by Robert C. Bonner,
a later Administrator of the US Drug Enforcement Agency, when he
responded to a subsequent petition lodged by NORML (US
Government, Federal Register, vol. 57, no. 59, 26 March 1992,
pp10,499-10,508). </p>

<p>Those in favour of rescheduling the drug argue that, for some,
the denial of cannabis as a medicine is particularly cruel.
Grinspoon argues that 'sick people are forced to suffer anxiety
about prosecution in addition to their anxiety about the illness
... Doctors are afraid to recommend what they know to be the best
treatment because they might lose their reputation or even their
licence' ([9]Grinspoon 1991). </p>

<p>The Australian medical community has not been as enthusiastic
about the therapeutic benefits of cannabis although many argue
that where the drug has been demonstrated to be effective its use
should be permitted. A study done at the Royal Children's
Hospital in Melbourne found that THC (the psychoactive ingredient
in cannabis) was an effective anti-emetic for some children
undergoing chemotherapy ([10]Cartwright 1983). Dr Lorna
Cartwright, a lecturer in Pharmacology at Sydney University
stated: </p>

<p>I think there are probably better drugs for medical uses. The
point is, though, I think it should be allowed to be used for
conditions in which it has been shown to have effect, such as for
glaucoma, for children having chemotherapy and for epilepsy. I
always feel that if something is good even for a small percentage
of patients, it should be allowed to be used (cited in
[11]Caswell 1992, p498). <br>
</p>

<p>Another pharmacologist, Dr Greg Chesher, argues that cannabis
clearly has therapeutic benefits but that research into the
possible uses of the drug is being hampered by the fact that
cannabis is a prohibited drug (cited in [12]Caswell 1992). The
position in Australia is different from that in the USA in that
in this country there is no legislation or binding administrative
ruling specifically stating that no medical use exists for
cannabis.21 Neither does the United Nations Single Convention on
Narcotic Drugs, to which Australia is a party, specifically
forbid the medical use of cannabis. In fact the Convention
recognises that some otherwise illicit drugs may have medical
purposes and states that cannabis use should be 'subject to the
provisions of this Convention, to limit exclusively to medical
and scientific purposes the...use and possession of drugs'
(Article 4(1) (c)). Given that the United Nations Conventions do
not specifically proscribe the medical uses of cannabis,
introducing legislation that allowed the use of the drug for
medical purposes in Australia would be relatively simple. Clauses
authorising the therapeutic use of the drug could simply be
inserted into relevant drug legislation and therapeutic products
scheduling. Politically, however, such a change in policy could
be difficult. </p>

<p>As an illicit drug, cannabis has a negative image and is seen
as an being an inherently dependence producing, damaging drug
that has no possible benefits. Recognition of the medical
benefits of the drug may challenge this dominant view of
cannabis. </p>

<p> <b>APPENDIX 2. </b> </p>

<h1>INDUSTRIAL AND HORTICULTURAL USES OF CANNABIS </h1>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.GIF"><br>
</p>

<p> Since ancient times the fibres from the cannabis or hemp
plant have been used to make fabric, rope and paper ([1]Abel
1980). In World War II, the USA grew 50,000 acres of hemp, as
part of their war effort ([2]see United States Government 1944,
Hemp for Victory), and hemp fibres were used to make rope for
ships and the canvas used in parachutes. </p>

<p> More recently, experimental crops of a low THC-content
species of cannabis have been grown in The Netherlands, Italy,
Spain, France and Tasmania. Its fibres have been used in the
production of paper and fabric. Australian groups such as the
Business Alliance for Commercial Hemp argue that Australia should
allow the cultivation of hemp for industrial purposes. The
position is that, if a State or Territory Government authorises
the growing of cannabis, the Commonwealth will issue a permit for
the importation of seeds, provided that the applicant for the
import permit meets the criteria set out in the Act, such as
being 'a fit and proper person'. </p>

<p> The trade magazine for the US paper industry recently argued
that hemp has a number of advantages over timber in the area of
paper production, and there are a number of strong environmental
arguments for the commercial cultivation of hemp. Every four
months, each acre of hemp grown will produce 10 tons of fibre. It
can produce four times the amount of paper per acre than
20-year-old trees can, it requires less bleaching than pulp from
timber and, because it is a very densely growing crop, weeds are
choked and there is less need for pesticides and herbicides
([3]Young 1991). In addition, hemp requires less watering and
pesticides than cotton and produces a fibre that is argued to be
more durable than cotton fabrics ([4]Cowperthwaite 1993). </p>

<p> The United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs allows
the cultivation of cannabis for industrial and horticultural
purposes. Article 28(2) states that 'this Convention should not
apply to the cultivation of the cannabis plant exclusively for
industrial purposes (fibre and seed) or horticultural purposes'.
Australian drug legislation permits the cultivation of cannabis
for scientific purposes and some limited experimentation has
already taken place in Australia. </p>

<p> However, groups such as the Business Alliance for Commerical
Hemp argue that the full benefits of hemp production can only be
obtained if hemp is grown on a wider scale, and that cannabis
with a very low THC content can be grown for industrial purposes.
Legislation permitting the cultivation of cannabis for industrial
purposes could be included in existing drug legislation, however,
as with the medicinal use of cannabis, introducing legislation
that recognises the industrial uses of a substance that is
thought of simply as a dangerous illicit drug may pose political
difficulties for those advocating legislative change. </p>

<h1>The LaGuardia Report </h1>

<h1>THE CLINICAL STUDY</h1>

<h2>PLAN AND SCOPE</h2>

<hr>

<p>Interest in the effects of marihuana on the human subject
follows two main lines: first, concerning what may be called
pleasurable effects which account for its widespread use- and
second, regarding undesirable effects, including those leading to
criminal and other antisocial acts. </p>

<p>In his monograph on marihuana, Walton has reviewed at length
the literature on hashish experience. He has grouped these
descriptions as retrospective accounts by professional writers
and physicians who have taken the drug through curiosity or
scientific interest, reports by physicians concerning patients
who have taken excessive doses, and observations by psychiatrists
on subjects under marihuana influence. In all of these instances
a dose toxic to the individual had been taken and the effects
described correspond to psychotic episodes of greater or less
degree. </p>

<p>In the literature there are commonly described two basic types
of effect, one of excitation, psychic exaltation, and inner
joyousness, with divorcement from the external world; the other a
state of anxiety with fear of consequences, such as death or
insanity. Either one of these types of reaction may be
experienced alone, but usually both are present during the
intoxication. They occur in no regular sequence but replace each
other in rapid succession. The euphoric and anxiety states are
generally accompanied by mental confusion, a rapid flow of
dissociated ideas, and a feeling of prolongation of time and
spatial distortion. Sexual desires or phantasies may also occur. </p>

<p>The detailed descriptions of the experience vary. Those given
by trained writers, such as Ludlow and Bayard Taylor, are vivid
and dramatic, embodying sensual, visual, and auditory
illusions-phantasies of overpowering splendor and beauty, on the
one hand, and intense suffering and horror on the other. The
authors, familiar with stories of hashish effects and gifted with
strong imaginative powers, undoubtedly were expectant of much
that happened. The account given by the eminent Philadelphia
physician, H. C. Wood, while following the same general pattern,
has much less embellishment. He describes a feeling of well-being
and inner joyousness and buoyancy and the performance of antics
which he knew to be foolish but was unable to control. He was
able to recall no illusions or hallucinations. Later a state of
anxiety came on, developing into an overpowering fear of death. </p>

<p>A number of studies by psychiatrists on selected subjects have
been reported. An excellent example is that of Kant and Krapf.
Each acted as subject for the other and the effects of marihuana
are described and analyzed at length. In general, the objective
in such studies is the interpretation of the reactions in terms
of disturbances in psychological processes and functionings. The
descriptions referred to have been given by persons of a higher
social class, well educated and accustomed by training to act in
conformity with conventional social behavior. Although a state of
irritability may occur and threats of suicide be made by
individuals of this type under toxic doses of marihuana, it is
noteworthy that in none of the descriptions is there found an
expression of antagonism or antisocial behavior which led to acts
of violence or what would be called criminal conduct. </p>

<p>Of more direct interest are the publications of Walter
Bromberg, psychiatrist, Bellevue Hospital,
Psychiatrist-in-Charge, Psychiatric Clinic, Court of General
Sessions of New York County. Marihuana users who are brought
before the court or admitted to the hospital come under his
observation and he has reported at length on the psychiatric
observations of 29 of these who showed psychotic reactions. He
describes two types of reactions, one an acute marihuana
intoxication with a psychotic syndrome, the other a toxic
psychosis. Acute intoxication occurs in any individual if the
marihuana is taken in sufficiently large doses. It comes on
promptly and passes off some hours later. In marihuana psychosis,
the symptoms are much more severe and of longer duration. He
describes a number of cases in which the psychotic state
continued for a number of days and required hospitalization. </p>

<p>The toxic psychosis seen in marihuana users occurs at any time
and is of indefinite duration. Bromberg states that the
relationship between cannabis and the onset of a functional
psychotic state is not always clear. The personality factor is of
undoubted importance and other toxic agents, such as alcohol and
other drugs, as well as endogenous elements, may be involved. The
symptoms, except for the longer duration, resemble those observed
in persons under marihuana intoxication, but often take on the
characteristics seen in schizophrenic or manic- depressive
psychosis. </p>

<p>A description of 11 cases admitted to Bellevue Hospital is
given for illustration. The marihuana was taken in the form of
cigarettes. In this group were 5 Negroes, 2 of whom were women, 1
Puerto Rican, and 5 whites, one of whom was a Mexican and another
a boy of 16. Except for one of the whites, a homosexual, they
were all of a low intellectual and social order. One of the
Negroes was arrested for following women in Central Park. The
others were admitted at their own request, or were sent in by the
police or family. Three of the group had definite sexual
stimulation but in none was there an outburst in the form of an
attack on women. The Puerto Rican became confused and excited and
began chasing people with an ice pick. Shortly after his
discharge he was readmitted to the hospital, was diagnosed as
definitely psychotic, and was transferred to a state hospital as
a schizophrenic. The majority of the group, 8 in fact, had
psychopathic personalities and 3 of these were transferred to
state institutions for further care. The group as a whole is
representative of those who come into the hands of the police
because of abnormal conduct and who are the source of the
sensational newspaper and magazine stories. </p>

<p>Bromberg's findings concerning the lack of a positive
relationship between marihuana and crime are described in the
sociological section of this study. </p>

<p>In marihuana literature, the action of the drug is usually
described from retrospective observation of the effects on a
single individual. Relationship to varying dosage, to the
subject's personality and background, to environmental conditions
when the drug was taken, is given little if any attention. It is
the lack of information concerning these and other factors
involved in marihuana reaction which has given rise to the
present confusion regarding its effects. </p>

<p>The clinical study here described was designed to afford
information not found in marihuana literature but necessary for
any comprehensive view of marihuana action. For obtaining this
information there were these requisites: an adequate number of
subjects for the study, a clear understanding of the mental and
physical make-up of each subject, a uniformity of environmental
factors, accurately graded dosage of marihuana, and standardized
methods of obtaining and recording marihuana effects. In addition
to defining the usual and unusual effects of marihuana, as shown
by subjective and objective symptoms and alterations in behavior
and in physical reaction, the study was expected to answer
questions which must arise in consideration of the problem as a
whole. Of special importance are these: Do marihuana users show
fundamental traits differentiating them from non-users? Do users
present evidence of psychological or physical damage directly
attributable to the drug? What are the pleasurable effects which
account for the widespread usage of marihuana? To what extent
does it lead to antisocial or dangerous behavior? </p>

<p>The sections covering the clinical study are under the
following headings: </p>

<p><b>A. Medical Aspects</b> </p>

<p>1. Symptoms and Behavior </p>

<p>2. Organic and Systemic Functions </p>

<p><b>B. Psychological Aspects</b> </p>

<p>1. Psychophysical and Other Functions </p>

<p>2. Intellectual Functioning </p>

<p>3. Emotional Reactions and General Personality Structure </p>

<p>4. Family and Community Ideologies </p>

<p><b>C. Comparison Between Users and Non-Users from the
Standpoint of Mental and Physical Deterioration</b> </p>

<p><b>D. Addiction and Tolerance</b> </p>

<p><b>E. Possible Therapeutic Applications<br>
<br>
</b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Organization for the Study<br>
</h2>

<p>The clinical studies were carried out at the Welfare Hospital
(1) a New York City hospital for chronic diseases on Welfare
Island. The quarters assigned to the study consisted of a ward of
eight beds for the group to be studied at any one period, an
adjoining ward of two beds for the study of individuals of the
group, three additional rooms with equipment for special
examinations, and a diet kitchen for the preparation of the
subjects' meals. </p>

<p>Four female nurses were employed and the subjects in the
larger ward were under constant supervision. In addition to
routine records, each nurse reported the behavior of the subjects
while she was on duty. Guards were assigned from the Department
of Correction and the New York City Police Force for the subjects
drawn from the Riker's and Hart Island penitentiaries and the
House of Detention for Women. </p>

<p>The facilities of the Third Medical Division laboratory were
used for general clinical laboratory examinations and for more
detailed study of organ functioning. For measurement of
psychological reactions, special apparatus was provided. A
description of equipment used for each division of the study is
given under its proper section. <br>

<p><b>LaGuardia Committee Report on Marihuana</b> </p>

<h1>ORGANIC AND SYSTEMIC FUNCTIONS </h1>

<p><b>Samuel Allentuck, MD</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The functions of the body organs and systems were studied in
the manner common to hospital practice according to the methods
and with the equipment in use at Welfare Hospital. The study was
designed to show not only the effects of varying doses of
marihuana but also whether subjects who had long been users of
the drug gave evidence of organic damage. The tests were made
before the drug was administered, during its action, and often in
the after period. </p>

<p>The heart and circulation, blood composition, kidney, liver
and gastro-intestinal function, and basal metabolism received
special consideration. </p>

<hr>

<h2>SUMMARY </h2>

<p>The most consistent effect of marihuana observed in this
division of the study was an increase in pulse rate which began
shortly after the taking of the drug, reached a peak in about two
hours, and gradually disappeared. In-a few instances a temporary
sinus tachycardia or sinus bradycardia was noted, but except for
these there were no abnormalities in rhythm. The increase in
pulse rate was usually accompanied by a rise in blood pressure. </p>

<p>There was in general an increase in the blood sugar level and
in the basal metabolic rate, quite marked in some subjects, but
in the majority the levels reached did not exceed the high normal
limits. </p>

<p>An increase in the frequency of urination was often observed. </p>

<p>There was, however, no appreciable increase in the total
amount of urine passed during the drug action. </p>

<p>Hunger and an increase in appetite, particularly for sweets,
was noted in the majority of the subjects, and the taking of
candy or sweetened drinks brought down a &quot;too high&quot;
effect of the drug. </p>

<p>Nausea and vomiting occurred in a number of instances,
diarrhea only during psychotic episodes. </p>

<p>On the other hand, the blood showed no changes in cell count,
hemoglobin per cent, or the urea nitrogen, calcium and phosphorus
figures. The figures for the circulation rate and vital capacity
and the results of the phenolsulfonphthalein test for kidney
infection and the bromsulfalein test for liver function were not
different from those of the control period. The
electrocardiograms showed no abnormalties which could be
attributed to a direct action on the heart. In the few
observations on gastric motility and secretion no evidence of
marihuana action on these functions was obtained. </p>

<p>The positive results observed, increase in pulse rate and
blood pressure, increase in blood sugar and metabolic rate, urge
to urinate, increased appetite, nausea and vomiting, and
diarrhea, were not intensified by an increase in dosage, for they
could occur in an equal degree after the administration of any of
the effective doses within the range used. All the effects
described are known to be expressions of forms of cerebral
excitation, the impulses from this being transmitted through the
autonomic system. The alterations in the functions of the organs
studied come from the effects of the drug on the central nervous
system and are proportional to these effects. A direct action on
the organs themselves was not seen. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Psychological Aspects</h2>

<h3>PSYCHOPHYSICAL AND OTHER FUNCTIONS </h3>

<p>Robert S. Morrow, PH.D. </p>

<p>In this phase of the study an effort was made to determine the
effect of marihuana on various psychomotor and some special
mental abilities. Appraisal of these effects was made wherever
possible through the use of standardized tests. A number of
different tests were originally tried under varying experimental
conditions on the group of 5 volunteer subjects who had never
before taken marihuana. Only those tests were retained which, in
the course of this preliminary investigation demonstrated the
greatest potentialities. With the tests finally selected it was
hoped to measure the effect of marihuana on the following
functions. </p>

<p><b>FUNCTIONS AND CAPACITIES TESTED</b> </p>

<p>Static Equilibrium This was measured by means of the Miles
Ataxiameter, which is an instrument for recording body sway. The
subject remains stationary in the ataxiameter with his hands at
his sides and his feet together while a system of pulleys
attached to a helmet on his head records the direction and degree
of movement. The subject's score is the cumulative sway in all
directions measured in millimeters. This test was applied to each
subject for two minutes with his eyes open and two minutes with
his eyes closed. Each trial was followed by a rest period of five
minutes. </p>

<p>Hand Steadiness Hand steadiness was measured by means of the
Whipple Steadiness Tester which consists of a metal disk with a
hole 3/16 of an inch in diameter, connected in series with dry
cells, an electric counter, and a stylus. The subject was
instructed to hold the stylus in the hole for two minutes without
touching the metal sides. Each contact with the side of the hole
was recorded and the total number of contacts gave an index of
unsteadiness of hand.<br>
</p>

<p>Speed of Tapping Speed of tapping was measured in somewhat the
same manner as was hand steadiness. The Whipple Apparatus was
used, the tapping board replacing the steadiness disk and a
thicker and heavier stylus replacing the steadiness stylus. The
subject tapped repeatedly on the metal plate for two minutes and
the total number of taps was recorded on the counter, thereby
giving a measure of motor speed. <br>
</p>

<p>Strength of Grip The Collins Dynamometer was used to measure
the subject's strength of grip. Three trials were made for each
hand and the scores averaged. </p>

<p>Simple and Complex Hand and Foot Reaction Time Special
apparatus was constructed to measure simple and complex hand and
foot reaction time. To measure simple hand reaction time, the
subject was instructed to press down on a telegraph key and
remove his hand as quickly as possible when a red light appeared
on the board which stood directly before him. A Cenco counter
recorded the reaction time, that is, the time which elapsed
between the presentation of the stimulus and the response. </p>

<p>For the measurement of simple foot reaction time, the subject
pressed down on a pedal with his foot, removing it as quickly as
possible when the red light appeared. </p>

<p>For the measurement of complex (choice or discrimination) hand
and foot reaction time either a red or a blue light served as a
stimulus. The subject had no advance knowledge as to which color
light would appear. For measuring the response with the hand, the
subject pressed down on the telegraph key with the right hand
and, at the sight of the red light, moved the peg from the red
compartment into the center (neutral) compartment with the left
hand, then removed the right hand from the key; at the appearance
of the blue light, he moved the peg from the blue to the neutral
compartment. For measuring complex foot reaction time, the
procedure was similar to that for estimating the hand reaction
time except that the right foot and the pedal were substituted
for the right hand and the telegraph key. </p>

<p>Each subject made fifteen trials for each of the four
variations. </p>

<p>Musical Aptitude Musical aptitude was determined by means of
the Kwalwasser- Dykema Music Tests. The eight tests administered
were the tonal memory test, the quality discrimination test, the
intensity discrimination test, the tonal movement test, the time
discrimination test, the rhythm discrimination test, the pitch
discrimination test, and the melodic taste test. The sum of the
scores for these separate tests was used to give a total score
for musical aptitude. </p>

<p>Auditory Acuity By means of the Galton Whistle, the subjects'
limits of auditory acuity were gauged for both ascending and
descending frequencies. </p>

<p>The final score was the average of the results of three trials
in each direction. </p>

<p>Perception of Time An attempt was made to appraise the
subject's facility in estimating time by asking him to state
when, after a given signal, he thought the following intervals
had elapsed - fifteen seconds, one minute, and five minutes.
Several trials were given for each time interval and the average
of the results of the trials was taken as the final score. </p>

<p>Perception of Length Subjects were asked to estimate the
length of lines which were 3 inches, 5 inches, and 8 inches in
length and to draw lines of 3 inches and 7 inches. </p>

<p>The Subjects Fifty-four subjects were used in this part of the
experiment, 36 marihuana users and 18 non-users. The two groups
were equated approximately for the following factors: age,
height, weight, years of formal education, and number of arrests.
The age range for the user group was from 21 to 45 years with
27.9 years as an average, the age range for the non-user group
was from 22 to 43 years with 29.8 years as an average. The range
in height for the users was from 54 to 75 inches with a mean of
67.5 inches- for the non-users the range was from 60 to 71 inches
with a mean of 66.8 inches. Range in weight for the users was
from 123 to 178 pounds with 151.3 pounds as the mean, for the
non-users from 115 to 180 pounds with 149.5 pounds as the mean.
The schooling of the user group ranged from no education at all
to 10 years with a mean of 7.1 years, that of the non- users
varied from 6 to 12 years with a mean of 8.3 years. As regards
the number of arrests, the range for users was from 1 to 20 with
a mean of 5.1 and for the non-users from 1 to 15 with a mean of
5.3. </p>

<p>The two groups differed radically with respect to race. Of the
36 marihuana users, 11 (31 per cent) were white, 18 (50 per cent)
were Negroes, and 7 (19 percent) were Puerto Ricans. Of the 18
non- users, 12 (67 per cent) were white, 6 (33 per cent) were
Negroes, and none were Puerto Rican. </p>

<p>In addition, the user group was analyzed with respect to the
age when the marihuana habit was begun, the duration of the
habit, the number of marihuana cigarettes generally smoked per
day, and the period of deprivation. The variation of the habit as
already described for the entire group of users applies to the 36
subjects studied here. </p>

<p>Procedure The tests were first administered to the subjects
before they had taken marihuana, then about a week later when
they were under the influence of 2 cc. of marihuana, and finally
another week later after 5 cc.(1) of marihuana had been
administered. On each occasion the psychomotor tests for static
equilibrium, hand steadiness, tapping, strength of grip, and
reaction time were repeated at hourly intervals for eight
successive hours in order that the time-effects of marihuana
might be determined.(2) The other tests, that is, those measuring
musical ability, auditory acuity, visual ) memory, and perception
of time and length were given to the subjects while in the
undrugged condition and from three to four hours after the drug
had been administered. The music tests were given under normal
conditions and after 5 cc. of marihuana had been administered,
but not under 2 cc. dosage. </p>

<p>In almost all instances the marihuana was given in the morning
shortly after breakfast and generally after a day when no drug
had been taken in order that &quot;hangover&quot; effects might
be avoided. For the most part the subjects rested and did little
or nothing except the prescribed tests on days when marihuana was
taken. </p>

<p>The equilibrium, steadiness, tapping and strength of grip
tests were given together on one day and the different forms of
the reaction- time test on another day. Ordinarily four or five
days elapsed between retests. </p>

<p>In addition to being tested after standard doses of the
marihuana concentrate had been ingested, 11 users and 9 non-users
were tested after smoking marihuana cigarettes.(3) The cigarettes
weighed from 4 to 8 grains each. Most of the subjects smoked five
cigarettes, two non-users smoked only three, and one nonuser
smoked four. The tests with cigarettes were given at
quarter-hour, half-hour and hour intervals. </p>

<p>(1) A dose of 5 cc. of marihuana proved &quot;too much&quot;
for many non-user subjects in the sense that ingestion of this
amount was often followed by nausea and general symptoms of
malaise which interfered with further testing. </p>

<p>For this reason the higher dose for non-users was sometimes
reduced to 3 cc. or 4 cc. In all, only 6 of the non-user subjects
took the S cc. dose. Accordingly, although the higher dosage is
referred to as S cc. it should be noted that the actual amount
used varied from 3 cc. to 5 cc. </p>

<p>(2) The scores for the first 25 users and 6 non-users were
obtained every half hour, but since there was little difference
between the half-hourly and hourly results it was decided to
record hourly scores only, except for the first half hour. </p>

<p>(3) A short experiment in which placebos were employed was
also tried on these subjects. An attempt was made to have the
placebos simulate the marihuana as much as possible but
unfortunately the placebo pills had a distinctive taste which
rendered them easily identifiable. The subjects referred to them
as the &quot;licorice&quot; pills or the &quot;blanks.&quot;
While the experiment was completed and resulted in some
interesting findings, the factors which might have invalidated
the results were so serious that these experiments are not
reported at this time.<br>
</p>

<p>Summary and Conclusions </p>

<p>1. The effect of marihuana on the psychomotor functions
depends primarily on the complexity of the function tested.
Simpler functions like speed of tapping and simple reaction time
are affected only slightly by large doses (5 cc.) and negligibly,
if at all, by smaller doses (2 cc.). On the other hand, the more
complex functions like static equilibrium, hand steadiness, and
complex reaction time may be affected adversely to a considerable
degree by the administration of both large and small doses of
marihuana. </p>

<p>2. The function most severely affected is body steadiness and
hand steadiness. The ataxia is general in all directions rather
than predominant in any particular axis. </p>

<p>3. The effects produced by larger doses (5 cc.) are
systematically, though not necessarily proportionately, greater
than those brought about by small doses. </p>

<p>4. The time required by the drug to exert its maximum effect
varies somewhat with the function and size of dose, but, on the
whole, time curves for both functions and dosages have similarity
of form The effect of the drug begins from one to two hours after
ingestion and reaches its peak at the fourth hour, after which it
declines so that by the eighth hour most of it is dissipated. </p>

<p>5. When marihuana is taken in cigarette form the psychomotor
effects are similar in character and trend to those observed
after the ingestion of the drug but they occur much sooner and
taper off more quickly. </p>

<p>6. The effects seem to be essentially the same for women as
for men, except that women are sometimes affected maximally at
the second or third hour after the drug is administered. In women
the return to the normal condition is in some instances quicker
and more abrupt than it is in the men. </p>

<p>7. Non-users generally seem to be more affected by the drug
when it is ingested than are users. 8. Auditory acuity is not
affected by marihuana. </p>

<p>9. There is no evidence that musical ability, of non-musicians
at least, is improved by marihuana. </p>

<ol>
    <li>The ability to estimate short periods of time and short
        linear distances is not measurably affected by the
        ingestion of marihuana. </li>

<p><b>The Drug Policy Task Force, sponsored by the New York
Country Lawyers' Association, commenced its operations in the
Fall of 1993. The Task Force was established as a
&quot;blue-ribbon&quot; panel of prominent and respected
individuals, each known for his or her work, insights and
involvement in the area of drug policy reform.</b></p>

<p><b>The stated purpose of the Task Force has been to develop
and urge implementation of rational and workable alternatives to
current drug policy on both the state and federal levels.</b></p>

<p><b>In an effort to develop a comprehensive and well-balanced
approach to future drug policy, participants of the Task Force
were drawn from various disciplines, including legal, medical and
academic, as well as from each branch of government --
legislative, judicial and executive.</b></p>

<p><b>After extensive study, public hearings, discussion and
analysis of various issues within the broad scope of the drug
policy debate, this working body now offers its &quot;Report and
Recommendations&quot; for public consideration.</b></p>

<p><b>The work of the Task Froce, toward development of a
comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to an effective and
responsible drug policy, and in tackling the difficult issues
involved in this important area, is ongoing. The &quot;Report and
Recommendations&quot; which follow should be read and considered
in the context of the continuing nature of this endeavor.</b></p>

Failure Of Contemporary Drug Policy<br>
To Meet Its Stated Objectives</h2>

<p><i><a href="nycla.htm#toc">Return to Table of Contents</a></i> </p>

<p>It has become a widely accepted fact that drug policy, as
employed during the past three decades by the federal government,
and in state and local jurisdictions throughout the United
States, has largely failed to meet its stated objectives. </p>

<p>Current drug policy relies on an &quot;enforcement&quot; or
&quot;penal&quot; model, emphasizing interdiction, arrest,
prosecution and incarceration of both distributors and users of
controlled substances as its primary &quot;weapons&quot; in what
has often been characterized as a &quot;war on drugs.&quot;
Commonly known substances generally designated as
&quot;controlled&quot; or illegal include: hallucinogens
(marijuana, hashish, mescaline and LSD), stimulants (amphetamines
and cocaine), and depressants (opium, heroin and barbiturates).
(1) </p>

<p>Notwithstanding the vast public resources expended on the
enforcement of penal statutes against users and distributors of
controlled substances, contemporary drug policy appears to have
failed, even on its own terms, in a number of notable respects.
These include: minimal reduction in the consumption of controlled
substances; failure to reduce violent crime; failure to markedly
reduce drug importation, distribution and street-level drug
sales; failure to reduce the widespread availability of drugs to
potential users; failure to deter individuals from becoming
involved in the drug trade; failure to impact upon the huge
profits and financial opportunity available to individual
&quot;entrepreneurs&quot; and organized underworld organizations
through engaging in the illicit drug trade; the expenditure of
great amounts of increasingly limited public resources in pursuit
of a cost-intensive &quot;penal&quot; or
&quot;law-enforcement&quot; based policy; failure to provide
meaningful treatment and other assistance to substance abusers
and their families; and failure to provide meaningful alternative
economic opportunities to those attracted to the drug trade for
lack of other available avenues for financial advancement. (2) </p>

<p>Moreover, a growing body of evidence and opinion suggests that
contemporary drug policy, as pursued in recent decades, may be
counterproductive and even harmful to the society whose public
safety it seeks to protect. This conclusion becomes more readily
apparent when one distinguishes the harms suffered by society and
its members directly attributable to the pharmacological effects
of drug use upon human behavior, from those harms resulting from
policies attempting to eradicate drug use. (3) </p>

<p>With aid of these distinctions, we see that present drug
policy appears to contribute to the increase of violence in our
communities. It does so by permitting and indeed, <i>causing</i>
the drug trade to remain a lucrative source of economic
opportunity for street dealers, drug kingpins and all those
willing to engage in the often violent, illicit, black market
trade. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the effect of present policy serves to stigmatize
and marginalize drug users, thereby inhibiting and undermining
the efforts of many such individuals to remain or become
productive, gainfully employed members of society. Furthermore,
current policy has not only failed to provide adequate access to
treatment for substance abuse, it has, in many ways, rendered the
obtaining of such treatment, and of other medical services, more
difficult and even dangerous to pursue. (4) </p>

<p>The appropriate goal of any drug policy must be to decrease
the prevalence and spread of harmful drug use and substance
abuse, and to minimize the harms associated with such problems
where they are found to exist. (5) Additionally, any policy which
creates more harmful results than the societal problems it
proposes to solve, must be re-evaluated in terms of the
advisability of further pursuit of such policy. Further, to
justify continuation of any public policy, the costs incurred
must always be weighed against the benefits derived. It is within
this context, and with these criteria in mind, that present
approaches to drug policy must be objectively assessed and, where
appropriate, alternative models for future policy evaluated and
considered. (6) </p>

<p>In making its assessment, the Task Force has concluded that
contemporary drug policy has failed by virtually every objective
standard. Accordingly, we call for a dramatic shift in thinking
and approach in development and implementation of future drug
control efforts. At this time, although not recommending
&quot;decriminalization&quot; or &quot;legalization&quot; of most
substances currently designated as &quot;controlled&quot; under
federal and state penal statutes, the Task Force does urge that
certain incremental steps be taken to alleviate the more easily
resolved economic and social costs associated with current drug
policy. These include: the decriminalization of marijuana;
further measures attempting to separate the &quot;hard&quot; drug
markets (e.g., for heroin and cocaine), from markets for
&quot;soft&quot; drugs (e.g., marijuana and hashish); the
downward modification of existing draconian sentences for other
non-violent drug offenses; the elimination of mandatory minimum
sentences in drug cases; and increased judicial discretion in the
sentencing of drug offenders, with further reliance upon drug
treatment and other diversionary programs as alternatives to
incarceration for the non-violent drug offender. Moreover, we
highly recommend the further study and serious consideration of
other alternative, non-criminal, regulatory drug control
measures, developed in accordance with a &quot;public
health&quot; rather than a &quot;penal&quot; model of drug
policy. </p>

The Costs Of<br>
Current Drug Policy</h2>

<p><i><a href="nycla.htm#toc">Return to Table of Contents</a></i> </p>

<h3><a name="part2a"></a>A. The Economic Costs</h3>

<p>Whether viewed in isolation or on balance with the benefits
derived, there can be no question that the economic costs of
contemporary drug policy, as employed on the federal and state
levels, have proved unacceptably high. Indeed, as we face a
future of increasingly limited resources, the continuation of
present policy, with overwhelming emphasis on the arrest,
prosecution and incarceration of drug offenders, will produce
exponential growth in expenditures required to accommodate and
maintain this policy. (7) </p>

<p>As a result of the stepped up incarceration of &quot;drug
offenders&quot; during the past three decades, since the early
1970's, our nation has seen an alarming increase in the number of
individuals incarcerated within its borders. (8) Meanwhile, in
addition to all other resources utilized, the need for additional
prison beds and increased correctional budgets has also grown
exponentially, on both state and federal levels. (9) </p>

<p>Other unacceptably high costs in the present
&quot;penal-based&quot; model of drug policy have been: court
budgets strained beyond capacity, affecting the ability of our
court systems to adequately address both criminal and civil cases
coming within their respective jurisdictions; large portions of
federal, state and local law enforcement resources devoted to
drug interdiction, arrest and prosecution; large portions of
federal and state prosecutors' budgets devoted to drug cases;
increased costs for court appointed public defenders; and growing
budgets for other national and international drug enforcement
efforts -- all exacting a substantial drain on the increasingly
limited financial resources of the nation. </p>

<p>Further, the exponential growth in the number of individuals
incarcerated throughout the nation has already, and will
increasingly, cause incalculable economic costs in terms of: lost
productivity of those individuals incarcerated; state support of
families deprived of breadwinners; and the economic decline of
impoverished communities through incarceration of great numbers
of those in the prime of their productive lives, and their
reduced earning capacity upon release from prison. </p>

<h3><a name="part2b"></a>B. The Social Costs</h3>

<p>The adverse effects of current drug policy have been felt most
profoundly in the urban centers of our nation. The imposition of
penal sanctions for drug possession and sale has proven a
woefully ineffective and otherwise harmful means of attempting to
control substance abuse in communities where, for some, drugs are
often the only escape from the harsh realities of poverty. In a
climate where there is no treatment on demand, criminalizing the
substance abuser may be viewed as profoundly inhumane and
counterproductive. </p>

<p>Imprisoning individuals for drug use causes further detriment
to those individuals and their families, destroying family
cohesion and undermining rehabilitation efforts. (10) The
increase in fatherless and motherless homes, which the current
policy of emphasis on incarceration causes, is extraordinarily
disruptive to the family unit, where often, those harmed the most
are the children. The separation of children from their primary
caretakers due to long term imprisonment, often results in a
marked decline in the quality of shelter, nutrition, medical
assistance and emotional nurturing. Studies have shown that
children whose primary caretakers have spent significant amounts
of time in prison are more likely to manifest symptoms of
anxiety, depression, behavioral difficulties and juvenile
delinquency, which may often be followed by adult criminal
activity. (11) Many of these children, often left in the care of
less able caretakers, have turned to peer relationships with
gangs, seeking to establish a family substitute. (12) </p>

<p>The criminalization and consequent stigmatization of drug
users, whether or not accompanied by a period of incarceration,
&quot;marginalizes&quot; users, since a criminal record decreases
the likelihood of successful employment and complete
rehabilitation, while continuing to impact upon family finances.
This, in turn, exacerbates financial and social instability in
households, and financial and emotional instability in
neighborhoods, while burdening otherwise stretched resources of
public assistance programs. </p>

<p>Moreover, the increased enforcement of civil forfeiture laws
has further undermined the security and stability of families.
Recognizing a growing trend of evictions and asset forfeiture as
a further weapon employed in the &quot;war on drugs,&quot; entire
families have lost and continue to lose homes and other
substantial assets for the acts of a single household member,
thereby punishing even drug-free members of the community. (13) </p>

<p>The black market created by drug prohibition turns
neighborhoods into war zones -- through turf wars over the huge
profits to be made in the illicit drug industry, violent
altercations over drug transactions gone bad, and battles between
local drug dealers and law-enforcement officers. The increase in
violent street crime which this situation engenders, aggravated
by the experience of violent prison culture which incarcerated
offenders bring back to their neighborhoods upon release, creates
a dangerous situation for all members of inner city communities. </p>

<p>Moreover, the street culture of guns and violence spawned by
the drug trade spills over into other social interaction in urban
neighborhoods, with violence becoming a commonly accepted mode of
conflict resolution. Community residents live in fear of the
violent street culture generated, in large part, by the
black-market drug trade, and the increased incidence of innocent
pedestrians struck in the cross-fires or by stray bullets from
battles involving participants in the drug trade. (14) </p>

<p>History has shown us that even in an atmosphere of prohibition
and criminalization of drug dealing, participation in the drug
trade will continue to be widespread, since it indisputably
provides the greatest entrepreneurial opportunity to many in
poorer communities. There is a strong economic motivation for
young people and those who might otherwise be legally employed
and law-abiding to engage in the sale of drugs, due to the high
profits generated by the illicit industry in an environment of
drug prohibition, and the dearth of opportunities for poor,
uneducated youth in the legitimate job market. </p>

<p>Harsh sentencing laws themselves lead to the active
recruitment of children and first time offenders (frequently
women - &quot;drug mules&quot;) into the drug trade, so that
dealers themselves can escape such penalties. (15) Evidence
further reveals, that due to the great economic incentives
represented by the illicit drug trade, when one street dealer is
temporarily incapacitated by incarceration, there is a ready
supply of others waiting in the wings to fill the gap in the
market. As such, not only does the widespread incarceration of
low-level drug dealers fail to deter others from entering into
the drug trade, it arguably draws more individuals into the
illegal trade than would otherwise occur without the periodic
removal of many of its participants. (16) </p>

<p>Moreover, the deterrence rationale of harsh sentencing does
not necessarily operate among the drug dealing community as might
be anticipated, where many assume the extraordinary risks already
involved in the violent but lucrative illicit drug trade. As one
observer has noted: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Apprehended dealers are replaced from a seemingly
    bottomless pool, for jail is not a deterrent to those who
    daily risk death in the drug trade.&quot; (17)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additionally, with respect to users of certain controlled
substances, it appears questionable that conventional deterrence
theory can be meaningfully applied where substance abuse may be
accompanied by physical addiction. </p>

<p>Finally, a social byproduct of the misplaced allocation of
financial resources which concentrates huge expenditures on the
apprehension and imposition of penal sanctions on drug users and
local drug dealers, is a clogged criminal justice system unable
to focus on society's larger crime problems. Courts jammed with
drug cases inevitably results in insufficient resources available
to properly attend to these and other more serious crimes
appearing on overburdened court dockets. This logjam leads to
instances of &quot;revolving door&quot; justice even for violent
criminals, since the system simply cannot handle the overload.
(18) A further result of these conditions is a perceived
trivialization of violent crime itself, reinforced by a penal
scheme which punishes drug crimes as severely or more severely
than many criminal acts of violence. </p>

<hr>

<h2 align="CENTER"><a name="part3"></a>III.<br>
Public Health Consequences<br>
Of Current Drug Policy</h2>

<p><i><a href="nycla.htm#toc">Return to Table of Contents</a></i> </p>

<p>The Task Force views substance abuse as, first and foremost, a <i>public
health</i> issue. Accordingly, it appears that problems of
substance abuse would be more appropriately and effectively
addressed within our health care delivery systems, rather than by
our law enforcement agencies, courts and correctional
institutions. </p>

<p>The emphasis on a &quot;penal&quot; model of drug control
results in reduced funding for drug treatment facilities. This is
an unfortunate irony, since, as concluded by RAND researchers in
a 1994 report, a dollar's worth of drug treatment is worth seven
dollars spent on the most successful law-enforcement efforts to
curb the use of cocaine. (19) </p>

<p>Moreover, the fear of arrest, stigmatization and even removal
of their children from homes, (20) discourages substance abusers
from taking advantage of those health care and counseling
facilities which are available. (21) Pregnant women who are
substance abusers are deterred from seeking adequate prenatal
care, resulting in unhealthier children. A single positive drug
test result during pregnancy can trigger mandatory reporting
requirements. Therefore, the current policy of criminalization of
drug use amplifies potential health hazards of substance abuse,
and inhibits access to treatment, even for non-drug use related
health care. </p>

<p>Since possession and sale of any controlled substance is
illegal, dangerous drugs (which despite criminalization are still
widely available on the black market) are completely unregulated.
Under a scheme of criminalization, regulatory control is ceded to
underworld figures, including violent, predatory and often
ruthless criminals. This total lack of quality control of illicit
drugs on the market results in more dangerous, adulterated drugs
being produced and consumed, which, in turn, causes more disease
and death from the use of controlled substances than would occur
if the production and distribution of these drugs were regulated
by, for instance, U.S. Food and Drug Administration safety
regulations, warnings and other labeling requirements. (22) </p>

<p>The &quot;zero tolerance&quot; approach to the &quot;drug
problem,&quot; with its primary emphasis on law enforcement and
penal sanctions, results in an absence of any quality control for
illegal drugs widely consumed throughout the nation, and a lack
of information concerning safer drug use. This presents further
serious health costs brought on by current drug policy, which
ignores the reality that some degree of drug use in our society
is inevitable. This lack of public education and safety
regulations dramatically, and unnecessarily, increases the health
risks involved in the consumption of those drugs presently
designated as illegal. </p>

<p>Accordingly, it appears that present drug control laws
themselves, have directly led to an increase in the health risks
associated with drug use and substance abuse. In addition to
those dangers posed by lack of quality control and safety
regulations governing illegal drugs, drug paraphernalia laws,
together with a failure to promote needle exchange programs, have
resulted in the preventable spread of AIDS and other similarly
transmitted diseases to users, their partners and children. (23) </p>

<p>Moreover, easier interdiction of marijuana, (with a larger
mass than other controlled substances), causes greater relative
availability of &quot;harder,&quot; stronger, more dangerous
drugs (e.g., cocaine and heroin), which are easier to conceal,
transport and distribute. Additionally, increased dangers to our
youth and others who may consume &quot;soft&quot; drugs, (e.g.,
marijuana and hashish), result from failure of current policy to
separate out the markets for &quot;hard&quot; drugs from those
for &quot;soft&quot; drugs. Therefore, since consumption of all
of these drugs is illegal, (and distributed in the same
&quot;black-market&quot;), those who only purchase and smoke
marijuana, for instance, are inevitably forced to come in contact
with a more dangerous criminal element in order to obtain this
relatively harmless substance. (24) </p>

<p>Violence associated with the illicit drug trade creates
substantial public health problems, in the form of injuries and
death. These health problems arise from effects of drug
prohibition rather than substance abuse <i>per se</i>. Evidence
suggests that gunshot wounds (due to &quot;drug-trade
related&quot; violence) are more prevalent than overdoses
(&quot;drug-induced&quot; injuries) in inner city hospital
emergency rooms of major metropolitan areas. (25) Moreover, in
addition to the empirical evidence, our nation's experience with
alcohol prohibition suggests the validity of these observations.
Once prohibition ended, so did the violence associated with black
market alcohol distribution. (26) </p>

<p>&quot;Drug prohibition&quot; also causes an increased demand
for more potent <i>legal</i> substances, like alcohol, which is
decidedly more harmful than certain controlled substances, most
notably, marijuana. (27) Moreover, current drug policy is found
to be, in ways, arbitrary and inconsistent, since it has been
proven that among the most dangerous commonly consumed drugs are
tobacco and alcohol, both of which are legal. (28) </p>

<p>Finally, current drug policy discourages research into
potentially therapeutic effects of psychotropic drugs, (29) e.g.
&quot;medical marijuana,&quot; which is known to alleviate the
suffering of cancer patients and to be therapeutically beneficial
in treatment of certain other diseases. (30) </p>

<hr>

<h2 align="CENTER"><a name="part4"></a>IV.<br>
The Relationship of<br>
Drug Policy to Violent Crime</h2>

<p><i><a href="nycla.htm#toc">Return to Table of Contents</a></i> </p>

<p>There exists a large and growing body of respected opinion and
credible evidence which suggests that contemporary drug policy
has failed to deter or reduce the prevalence of violent crime in
our communities, notwithstanding harsh treatment of drug
offenders under present &quot;penal&quot; or &quot;law
enforcement&quot; based policy. Indeed, many observers have
concluded that the current form of &quot;drug prohibition&quot;
has <i>generated</i> a great deal of violence, much of it armed
violence encountered in the lucrative underworld drug industry,
and some deriving from law enforcement efforts themselves in the
&quot;war on drugs&quot;. </p>

<p>In analyzing these issues, we take great care to distinguish
between violence caused by actual <i>drug use or substance abuse</i>
(&quot;drug-induced&quot; violence), and violence caused as a
byproduct of the high stakes involved in the illicit drug trade
(&quot;drug trade&quot; or &quot;drug prohibition&quot; related
violence). (31) This distinction is critical, because unless the
causes of crimes and violence are accurately identified, no
effective solutions can be found. </p>

<p>There is no doubt that some forms of drug use may result in
undesirable, unacceptable and anti-social behavior. (32) However,
it appears that the overwhelming causes of violent crimes, which
often find categorization under the heading of &quot;drug
related,&quot; are caused by various factors unrelated to actual
pharmacological effects of controlled substances upon human
behavior. (33) Rather, much of the violent crime can be said to
be &quot;drug prohibition-related,&quot; insofar as it results
from the high costs, huge profits and great stakes involved in
the world of drug commerce as is carried on in cities, states and
nations throughout the world. (34) Moreover, the complete banning
of all forms of use and sale of controlled substances, including
marijuana and hashish, has fostered an underworld black market,
for both &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; drugs, where
violence and weapons possession is part and parcel of doing
business under conditions of illegality. </p>

<p>In cities throughout the United States, we find a
proliferation of armed violence resulting from &quot;turf&quot;
wars for control of territory for lucrative drug sales, together
with regularly recurring dangerous and deadly altercations over
drug deals gone bad. In addition to this community-based
violence, there are &quot;shoot-outs&quot; between drug dealers
and law enforcement officers, the latter developing the need for
greater and more powerful weapons, only to be matched and then
surpassed by those in the drug trade who have enormous profits,
and personal liberty, at stake. The net result of these
circumstances has been an extraordinary casualty rate for those
involved in the drug trade, (35) injury and death to innocent
bystanders &quot;caught in the crossfires,&quot; injury and loss
of life to law enforcement officers, and a prevailing atmosphere
of violence in many inner city communities. </p>

<p>A further byproduct of these conditions is an increase of
weapons possession, and thereby, the weapons trade, where use and
sale of dangerous and increasingly powerful weapons have
proliferated. This widespread possession and use of dangerous and
deadly weapons has further resulted in the increase of armed
violence in our communities, not always directly related to local
drug wars, but fostered by the undercurrent of violence, guns and
money supported by the drug trade. </p>

<p>We note other ways in which current drug policy is likely
serving to exacerbate rather than alleviate violence in our
communities. Over the past decades, stepped up law enforcement
efforts, disproportionately carried out in our inner city
communities, have resulted in large and increasing numbers of
minority youth being brought within control of the criminal
justice system. It is reported that almost 1 in every 3 young
black men in the U.S., between the ages of 20-29, is presently
within the control of the criminal justice system -- either in
prison, on parole or on probation. (36) This figure is up from
approximately 1 in every 4 as reported just 5 years ago. (37)
Together with the destabilization of families and communities
affected by wholesale removal of young men from their ranks, many
individuals arrested and incarcerated for the inherently
&quot;non-violent&quot; offenses of drug possession or sale, are
then exposed to the violence of prison culture. This violence is,
in turn, brought back to the communities to which these members
invariably return. </p>

<p>Current drug policy's emphasis on drug arrests, prosecution
and incarceration, also indirectly increases violence by
diverting law enforcement, court and other criminal justice
resources from concentration on violent crime and violent
criminal offenders. Further, institutional pressures bear upon
prosecutors to concentrate on drug case, since the availability
of paid and trained police and other law enforcement officers, as
primary witnesses in such cases, renders prosecution of drug
cases easier and the statistical rates of conviction (or return)
more favorable. (38) This is not to discount the political
emphasis often placed on prosecution of drug cases, nor, of
course, the obligation of prosecutors to process those cases in
which legally supportable arrests under current law have been
made. The net result has been a dramatic shift in the proportion
of &quot;non-violent&quot; to &quot;violent&quot; offenders
incarcerated in jails and prisons throughout the United States --
such shift decidedly toward imprisonment of
&quot;non-violent&quot; drug offenders, (39) further stretching
resources and limiting the ability of correctional institutions
to hold and maintain &quot;violent&quot; offenders within their
walls. (40) </p>

<p>On a more global level, there can be no question that the
immense fortunes to be made by involvement in the underground,
black market world of drug commerce, has resulted in enormous
power and wealth for national and international narcotics cartels
which, in the experience of various smaller nations, has
threatened national security itself. (41) </p>

<p>It is clear, therefore, that the most dangerous threats to our
security relating to drugs -- in our cities, throughout our
nation and even, internationally -- derive not from the
pharmacological effects of drug usage, but from the violence
engaged in and power amassed by an entire industry of underworld
figures, driven by the high costs and huge profits to be made in
the illicit drug trade. </p>

<p>Searching our nation's history for similar experiences from
which we may draw guidance, we turn, as many studying this issue
have, to our national experience with alcohol prohibition during
the early 20th century. (42) During that era of alcohol
prohibition, it was the <i>illegality</i> of that
&quot;controlled substance,&quot; alcohol, which drove up its
costs, caused a lucrative black market to develop, and supported
a widespread growth in wealth and power for underworld figures
and organizations. (43) This, in turn, brought on violence --
between competing bootleggers and racketeers, and between these
underworld interests and law enforcement officers -- as well as
other related and unrelated violence, much as we see today with
respect to the drug trade, although on a much larger scale. In
the case of drugs and &quot;drug prohibition,&quot; the
illegality of these substances has supported and perpetuated the
violent culture and dangerous cartels which have profited from
the resulting economic circumstances. As one commentator has
remarked: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;People aren't killing each other because they are
    high on drugs, any more than Al Capone ordered the execution
    of rival bootleggers because he was drunk.&quot; (44)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the final analysis, it appears evident that our nation's
drug policy has not only failed to resolve the problems of
violent crime, it has served to exacerbate them. Indeed, our
nation's &quot;war on drugs,&quot; as it has come to be known,
has likely had the net effect of causing a more dangerous
&quot;war&quot; to rage within our communities, with the only
vision of the future appearing to be, if present trends continue,
an increase in violence, the proliferation of weapons, a steady
supply of new community based drug dealers, and the continued
growth of ever-more dangerous &quot;kingpins&quot; and underworld
organizations -- all driven by the engine of the lucrative,
illegal drug trade. </p>

<p>It follows, therefore, that forms of
&quot;decriminalization,&quot; &quot;legalization,&quot; or
ending &quot;drug prohibition,&quot; must be seriously considered
as alternative directions for future drug strategy, however
radical such ideas may presently appear. (45) Accordingly, the
Task Force urges the further study of alternative, non-penal
based models, in development of future drug policy. </p>

<p>In summary, it is abundantly clear that, whatever the harms
presently caused by use and abuse of &quot;controlled&quot;
substances in our nation, many of the more pressing concerns with
respect to violence in our communities are unlikely to be solved
until we find a way to take the profit out of the black market
drug trade itself. If we continue to fail in addressing these
issues in an objective, rational and progressive manner, we may
find ourselves devoured by a larger, more dangerous beast of our
own creation. </p>

<hr>

<h2 align="CENTER"><a name="part5"></a>V.<br>
Drug Policy, Drug Law<br>
Enforcement And People Of Color</h2>

<p><i><a href="nycla.htm#toc">Return to Table of Contents</a></i> </p>

<p>The empirical evidence available clearly demonstrates that the
adverse effects of current drug policy impact disproportionately
on people of color. Although it is estimated that over 80% of
drug users are white, minorities comprise 74% of those
incarcerated for drug offenses. (46) Therefore, the injustices
inherent in the enforcement and criminal prosecution of drug
offenses impact more profoundly on communities of color. </p>

<p>Mandatory drug sentencing laws and the mass guilty pleas they
entail lead to insufficient checks on improper police activity,
since, generally, no trial or suppression hearings occur when a
defendant pleads guilty, at which forums improprieties on the
part of law enforcement officers may be exposed. Civil rights are
eroded with the creation of additional exceptions to the Fourth
Amendment's bar on warrantless searches (in what has effectively
become the &quot;drug exception&quot; to the U.S. Constitution),
while discriminatory stereotyping regarding the profile of a drug
dealer leads to the more frequent search and seizure of people of
color. Further, vaguely worded loitering and curfew laws,
intended to curb drug dealing, are disproportionately enforced on
inner city streets. </p>

<p>Other factors lead to a disparity in the racial makeup of
those arrested for narcotics offenses. Wealthier white drug users
make their purchases behind closed doors, in business districts
and in more isolated suburban communities, away from the eye of
law enforcement agents -- and therefore, more frequently escape
detection. On the other hand, street dealers, and many drug users
in inner city neighborhoods are considerably more exposed. </p>

<p>At the same time, a statistically high number of drug
prosecutions result in convictions. This is largely due to the
&quot;professional&quot; nature of witnesses involved in
narcotics cases, and because drug offenders are typically
apprehended as a result of &quot;buy-and-bust&quot; operations or
pursuant to &quot;observation sales,&quot; where police set up
operations in designated &quot;high crime&quot; neighborhoods, so
as to make undercover purchases from street dealers, and/or
observe and apprehend individuals involved in street sale and
purchase of narcotics. (47) Additionally, such community based
&quot;buy-and-bust&quot; and other similar operations tend to
concentrate on low level dealers and users rather than the drug
kingpins, since street sellers and purchasers are simply easier
to locate and apprehend. </p>

<p>Current drug policy has other irrational and discriminatory
consequences, e.g. the disparate treatment of crack-cocaine
offenders (generally poor people of color), versus powder-cocaine
offenders (generally white, middle-upper class), and the
inequitable prison sentences which this duplicity engenders. (48) </p>

<p>Due to lack of other forms of attention, by government and
private industry, inner city neighborhoods have become the
battleground for much of the drug trade, including enforcement
efforts by police. Moreover, the great sums of money involved in
the illegal drug trade encourages police corruption, leading to a
breakdown of appropriate law enforcement efforts in these
communities. Furthermore, broadly drafted civil forfeiture and
other similar laws, providing for the eviction of entire families
where one of its members may be involved in drug dealing, (49)
are more frequently enforced in poor communities, leading to
greater hardship in communities where higher numbers of black and
Latino people reside. </p>

<p>In summary, many of the social costs outlined in Section II(B)
above, are more profoundly felt in minority communities, to wit:
high incarceration rates, increase in fatherless and motherless
homes; active recruitment of children into the drug trade so that
dealers can escape harsh penalties of the drug laws; greater
financial and emotional instability in households; greater
financial and social instability in neighborhoods;
criminalization and stigmatization of many young members of these
communities, affecting their future employability; serious injury
to innocent bystanders caught in the &quot;cross-fires&quot; of
rival drug dealers and their battles with police; and a pervasive
street culture of guns and violence growing out of the drug trade
affecting other forms of social interaction in urban
neighborhoods, with violence becoming a commonly accepted mode of
conflict resolution. </p>

<p>Since current drug policy so profoundly and disproportionately
impacts upon people of color, review of present laws must be
undertaken to remove any discriminatory bias, and steps taken to
ensure that whatever drug control laws and strategies are
employed in the future, that they are fairly conceived and
even-handedly enforced. </p>

<h2 align="CENTER"><a name="part6"></a>VI.<br>
The Impact Of Current<br>
Drug Policy On Women</h2>

<p><i><a href="nycla.htm#toc">Return to Table of Contents</a></i> </p>

<p>Women, particularly minority women, have disproportionately
felt the adverse impact of the harsh drug sentencing laws. (50) A
study of female &quot;drug mules&quot; was conducted by the
Correctional Association of New York, (51) focused on
prosecutions occurring in Queens, New York, where JFK
International Airport serves as a major entry port for
international travel. The Correctional Association found a
startling increase in the number of women arrested and charged
with &quot;A-I&quot; felony narcotics offenses, many of whom were
first time arrestees. This was primarily a result of the combined
effect of the accessorial liability statute and the
&quot;Rockefeller Drug Laws,&quot; so that women suspected of
being used as couriers by drug smugglers frequently faced
mandatory prison sentences of 15 and 25 years-to-life, even on
their first arrest. (52) </p>

<p>The report further found that despite the fact that many of
these women claimed to be unwitting agents of drug distributors,
or marginally involved in drug operations, they did not go to
trial because of the excessively high stakes involved. Plea
bargain agreements, which guaranteed relatively short sentences
of 3 years-to-life, was &quot;too good&quot; an offer to refuse,
(although unconscionable under many individual circumstances),
given the risk of a much more severe sentence if found guilty at
trial. Many of these women were mothers, (53) unable or unwilling
to risk being separated from their children for considerably
longer periods in the event of conviction after trial, and
therefore pleaded guilty even if they were innocent or able to
present valid defenses to the offense charged. </p>

<p>In these cases, women are disproportionately affected by the
lack of judicial discretion involved in the mandatory sentences
statutes, regardless of any mitigating circumstances which may
exist. (54) Due to draconian drug laws such as these, which often
fail to distinguish between major and minor participants in drug
cases, fail to provide any relief for first time offenders, or to
allow reasonable consideration of other mitigating factors and/or
individual characteristics of the defendant, the resulting rate
of incarceration for women in Queens County, and for women
throughout the U.S., has grown dramatically in recent years. This
growth includes an increase of 275% from 1980 to 1992, in the
total number of women incarcerated in the U.S.; and an increase
of 433% during the five year period from 1986 to 1991, in the
number of women incarcerated in state prisons for drug offenses.
(55) </p>

<p>Even those women who are not defendants in drug cases are
profoundly affected by current drug policy, with its emphasis on
enforcement rather than rehabilitation. When fathers are
incarcerated for drug use or sale, it is the women who are left
to raise children in single parent households. When teenage boys
become involved in the drug trade, it is their mothers who are
evicted when civil forfeiture laws are enforced. When men who are
injection drug users share needles because of lack of
availability of clean needles, the women they sleep with risk HIV
infection. </p>

<p>For those women who have substance abuse problems, a
combination of mandatory reporting requirements and the child
abuse and neglect laws serve to deprive them of access to medical
services, pre-natal care, and even substance abuse counseling.
(56) </p>

<p>A further disturbing trend has emerged in states throughout
the nation, wherein pregnant women and new mothers, suffering
from substance abuse problems, face criminal prosecution on
serious charges, including drug distribution, assault and murder,
upon theories that such drug use, while pregnant, constitutes
&quot;delivery&quot; of drugs to the unborn fetus. (57) In these
cases, it is asserted that injury to the unborn and newly born
infant justifies imposition of severe criminal sanctions upon the
female drug user. These criminal prosecutions represent a new and
novel category of penal sanctions, (58) from which men are
entirely excluded -- another unfortunate result of our nation's
current punitive approach to drug policy. </p>

Effects Of Contemporary Drug Policy<br>
On The Integrity Of Government</h2>

<p><i><a href="nycla.htm#toc">Return to Table of Contents</a></i> </p>

<p>As a general principle, where respect for the integrity of
government is severely compromised, its ability to govern and the
rule of law itself breaks down. In this regard, we note that past
decades of drug policy, characterized by use of draconian penal
sanctions, has resulted in legislative and enforcement measures
of questionable wisdom and validity. </p>

<p>Integrity of government and, specifically, respect for its
representatives in the law enforcement community has been further
eroded by repeated incidents of individual and systemic police
corruption relating to the lucrative, black-market drug trade
with which many law enforcement officers come into contact.
Meanwhile, extreme harshness of drug laws, often requiring
draconian mandatory minimum sentences in the event of conviction
after trial, causes widespread plea bargaining and entry of
guilty pleas, even where such pleas are inappropriate. This
results in insufficient checks on improper police activity,
generally tested at hearings or trial of such cases. It further
results in the criminal conviction of innocent individuals, and
incarceration of many such individuals, (albeit for shorter
periods than had they been convicted after trial). A further
product of these circumstances, is the widespread deprivation to
individuals of the right to due process of law (through inability
to risk trial), and overall loss of confidence in the ability to
obtain fair treatment in our courts of justice. </p>

<p>Furthermore, there is a growing lack of respect for a justice
system where drug use or sale, although not generally viewed as
being as dangerous or morally reprehensible as the perpetration
of violent crime (e.g., robbery, assault, murder), is
nevertheless prosecuted more frequently, and more consistently.
We must also be mindful of the &quot;trivialization&quot; of
violent criminal conduct, fostered by undue emphasis upon drug
law enforcement and by a penal scheme which punishes drug crimes
as severely or more severely than many violent crimes. In New
York, for example, the sale of a $10 dollar quantity of cocaine
(a Class B felony) is treated as severely as the serious felonies
of armed robbery and rape, and more severely than the highest
charge of assault, i.e., crimes resulting serious physical injury
(a Class C felony). (59) </p>

<p>The inordinate concentration on street-level drug users and
sellers, (generally in inner city neighborhoods, often regarded
to as &quot;high crime&quot; areas), has resulted in the
disproportionate and discriminatory impact of drug laws upon
people of color throughout our nation. (60) Moreover, widespread
injustice often results from the imposition of unduly harsh
prison sentences upon drug offenders, pursuant to mandatory
minimum sentencing statutes, even for first time offenders
playing peripheral roles in the drug offenses with which they are
charged. (61) </p>

<p>Additionally, the substantial and relentless street-level
enforcement of drug laws, targeted mainly at youth populations in
our inner city communities, (unmatched by efforts to reduce
violent crime), has resulted in an atmosphere of police at
&quot;war&quot; with the community, and garnering a growing
disrespect for law enforcement and the perpetuation of an
&quot;us-against-them&quot; mentality with respect to both the
law enforcement community and the government which it represents. </p>

<p>The erosion of civil liberties tolerated in the name of the
&quot;war on drugs,&quot; has become so extreme that some
commentators have gone so far as to claim that &quot;[t]he Bill
of Rights is in danger of becoming meaningless in cases involving
drugs.&quot; (62) </p>

<p>The perceived imperative of waging the drug war has twisted
constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and
seizures by state officials beyond all recognition, setting an
ominous precedent for the widespread violation of individual
rights which inevitably extends to other governmental activities.
What might be called the &quot;drug exception&quot; to the
Constitution threatens the civil liberties of every citizen,
since precedents set in the context of a drug case are later
cited to justify limitations of civil rights in other contexts.
As has been further noted: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;The Supreme Court has permitted warrantless searches
    of automobiles, the use of anonymous tips and drug-courier
    profiles as the basis for police searches, and the seizure of
    lawyers' fees in drug cases. Property on which marijuana
    plants are found can be forfeited even if the owner is
    charged with no crime.&quot; (63)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also subject to continuing erosion are our citizens' rights to
privacy in the name of the &quot;drug war,&quot; represented by
unwarranted and unjustified drug testing of employees, property
searches of children, and other intrusions into the lives of
individuals not otherwise implicated in any criminal conduct so
as to justify such intrusions. For example, all federal employees
are required to submit to urine testing. (64) Such testing has
also become commonplace in private industry, not otherwise
confined by constitutional limitations but, nevertheless,
encouraged by governmental policies. </p>

<p>Serious &quot;due process&quot; and moral implications arise
through increased use of civil forfeiture laws, where innocent
families are deprived of substantial assets and, at times, their
homes, due to acts of a single household member, in which they
had no involvement and over which they had no control. For
example, the elderly mother of a drug dealer, who personally has
not participated in any illicit activities, may be evicted from
her home on the grounds that drug related activities were taking
place under her roof. Under these circumstances, the government
need only show that there existed reasonable grounds to believe
the property was subject to forfeiture -- i.e. that the home was
being used for illicit drug dealing activities. The burden of
proof then shifts to the owner (or lessee) of the property to
prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the property is
&quot;innocent&quot;. (65) Meanwhile, innocent family members of
suspected drug dealers may be rendered homeless. </p>

<p>Furthermore, there appears to have developed a trend towards
penalizing innocent property owners, where the government, unable
to succeed in its objectives through its own failed policies, has
begun to shift obligations and responsibilities for eradicating
drug activity to private citizens. For instance, in some
jurisdictions, owners of residential apartment buildings may be
deprived of their property through failure to evict suspected
drug dealers or users, even where the government, with its law
enforcement and prosecutorial powers, has been unable to convict
such individuals of any criminal activity. (66) </p>

<p>In summary, punitive, draconian, and often irrational
approaches to drug policy have, over time, caused unwarranted
encroachments upon the civil rights of those within our borders.
(67) These are often represented by exceptions to rights embodied
in the U.S. Constitution, including rights guaranteed under the
Fourth Amendment and the right of individuals to &quot;due
process of law,&quot; in diverse areas and at various levels of
governmental involvement. (68) </p>

<p>Therefore, to preserve the integrity of government itself,
particularly impacted by our nation's drug policy, we must
reassess our goals (which must be realistic), the purpose and
values implicit in those goals, as well as the means and policies
by which we hope to achieve betterment of our society. In
reassessing the appropriate direction for future drug policy, we
must first acknowledge that a drastic change in thinking and
approach is clearly called for. Our government's continued
pursuit of a failed, punitive policy, which serves not to provide
help and aid to those in need of assistance, but rather, to
&quot;criminalize,&quot; &quot;marginalize&quot; and
&quot;alienate&quot; growing numbers of its population,
ultimately causes more harm than good, garners disrespect for its
institutions, and raises the question of its ability to fairly
and effectively govern. </p>

<p>Accordingly, we must set out on a course to devise a policy
which inspires confidence for positive and meaningful progress in
combating substance abuse, violence, and other related problems
in our society. In embarking on such path, we would do well join
with the medical profession in adherence to the &quot;Hippocratic
oath,&quot; which in its most common form of expression
instructs: <i>&quot;First, do no harm&quot;</i>. </p>

<h2 align="CENTER"><a name="recommendations"></a>Task Force
Recommendations</h2>

<p><i><a href="nycla.htm#toc">Return to Table of Contents</a></i> </p>

<h3><a name="recommend1"></a>I. Pursue Alternative Models in
Establishing<br>
Future Drug Policy</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Replace emphasis on <i>&quot;penal&quot;</i> based
        approach to drug policy with &quot;medical&quot; or other
        alternative policy models, which view substance abuse and
        related problems as primarily a <i>public health</i>
        issue. </li>
    <li>Improve and expand drug treatment, vocational support and
        diversionary programs, utilizing extensive cost savings
        derived in transition from cost-intensive
        &quot;penal&quot; based approach to drug policy. </li>
    <li>Adopt a more rational and compassionate approach to drug
        policy, founded upon the humane treatment of substance
        abusers and their families, and placing emphasis on
        assisting those drug users who need treatment in
        obtaining such treatment, rather than emphasizing arrest,
        prosecution and incarceration as a solution. </li>
    <li>Integrate drug treatment centers with other community
        based health facilities, so as to bring substance abusers
        in need of treatment within the health care system. </li>
    <li>Expand methadone maintenance programs and apply resources
        saved in transition from a &quot;penal&quot; based
        policy, to support empirical research on effective
        treatments of substance abuse problems. </li>
    <li>Apply cost-benefit analysis for all drug control policies
        implemented, to ensure that any such policy is unlikely
        to cause more harm than use of the substance(s)
        prohibited. </li>
    <li>Consider alternative drug policy models which would allow
        for government regulation and quality control for
        currently designated &quot;controlled substances,&quot;
        in an effort to further reduce health risks associated
        with purchase and consumption of unsafe adulterated drugs
        from illegal, unregulated drug markets. </li>
    <li>Seriously study and consider alternative drug policy
        models, which attempt to remove huge profits which drive
        the illegal drug trade, in an effort to decrease the
        harms associated with &quot;drug prohibition.&quot; </li>
    <li>For those controlled substances which may be
        &quot;decriminalized,&quot; (e.g., marijuana), replace
        penal sanctions with government regulation and
        appropriate taxation. </li>
    <li>Allow states to experiment with alternative approaches to
        drug policy, including non-penal based models. </li>
    <li>Study alternative drug policies, including experimental
        programs conducted in the U.S. and abroad, in an attempt
        to arrive at the best, most helpful and cost-effective
        system available. </li>
    <li>Develop and encourage pilot programs and alternative
        approaches to substance abuse issues with close
        monitoring. </li>
    <li>Create state and federal commissions, including
        representatives from each of the executive, legislative
        and judicial branches of national and local governments,
        to recommend substantial and cohesive changes in drug
        policy. </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="recommend2"></a>II. Provide Immediate Sentencing
Relief and Additional<br>
Judicial Discretion in Criminal Prosecution of Drug Cases</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Repeal mandatory minimum sentencing statutes for
        non-violent drug offenders. </li>
    <li>Revise draconian drug laws, downgrading the category of
        &quot;non-violent&quot; narcotics offenses to levels more
        commensurate with the seriousness of these offenses in
        relation to other crimes. </li>
    <li>Expand judicial discretion in sentencing drug offenders
        on both the state and federal levels, permitting judges
        to sentence individual defendants in a manner suitable to
        the circumstances of the offense and the offender. </li>
    <li>Where appropriate, permit downward modification of
        sentences for &quot;drug mules&quot; and other low-level
        participants in drug transactions. </li>
    <li>Subject to constitutional protections, provide for
        statutory relief for presently incarcerated drug
        offenders, modifying sentences to reflect proposed
        amendments to drug laws. </li>
    <li>To the extent criminalization of use and sale of
        controlled substances remains in place, avoid the present
        system's over-reliance on weight-based criteria in drug
        prosecutions, reserving more serious penalties for sales
        where aggravating factors exist, such as sale to children
        or use of violence in trade. </li>
    <li>Establish and improve diversionary and treatment programs
        and other alternative-to-incarceration programs for
        non-violent drug offenders. Encourage increased
        utilization of probation department resources toward
        facilitating expanded use of such programs by courts in
        sentencing drug offenders.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="recommend3"></a>III. Reduce the Harms Associated
With Substance Abuse<br>
and Drug Prohibition</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Move from policy of &quot;zero tolerance,&quot; to one
        incorporating &quot;harm reduction&quot; principles,
        accepting the reality that marijuana and common
        recreational drugs, and other potentially harmful
        substances (including alcohol and tobacco), have always,
        and will continue to be consumed by some members of
        society, and concentrate efforts on reducing the harms
        associated with such use. </li>
    <li>Adjust policing priorities to concentrate enforcement
        efforts on curtailing and preventing violent criminal
        conduct, rather than emphasis on the apprehension and
        imposition of penal sanctions for use and consumption of
        drugs. </li>
    <li>Reduce the risk of young people coming into contact with
        the &quot;hard&quot; drug market by separating it out
        from the &quot;soft&quot; drug market. </li>
    <li>Expand availability of accurate information and education
        about harms which may be associated with drug use and
        substance abuse and ways to minimize those harms. </li>
    <li>Promote needle exchange programs and repeal drug
        paraphernalia laws, in order to curtail the spread of
        AIDS and other similarly transmitted diseases. </li>
    <li>Initiate measures and revise laws to promote, rather than
        hinder access of substance abusers to medical and other
        care, as may be needed. </li>
    <li>Assure doctor-patient privilege/confidentiality for those
        seeking treatment for substance abuse, pre-natal care and
        other forms of health care, to prevent fear of
        prosecution, removal of children from homes and other
        potential repercussions which discourage individuals from
        utilizing health care facilities.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="recommend4"></a>IV. Concentrate Law Enforcement
Resources on<br>
Reducing Violent Crime and Prosecution of<br>
Violent Criminal Offenders</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Reallocate law enforcement resources currently dedicated
        to the prosecution of non-violent drug offenders, toward
        prosecution of violent crime. </li>
    <li>Concentrate and redirect efforts of police, FBI, and
        other state, local and federal law enforcement agencies
        on investigation and arrest of violent criminal
        offenders. </li>
    <li>Reserve harsh sentencing laws, together with law
        enforcement, prosecution, court and prison resources for
        dealing with violent criminal offenders. </li>
    <li>Reject the notion that law enforcement efforts can
        eliminate drug use in our society, and redirect such
        policing efforts toward concentration on violence and
        community disruption. </li>
    <li>Attempt to eliminate causes of violent crime related to
        the lucrative illicit drug trade, by adopting policies
        which seek to remove huge profits from drug dealing and
        underworld black market narcotics distribution.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="recommend5"></a>V. Reshape the Drug Policy Debate --
Return to<br>
Objective Analysis and Realistic Goals</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Commence objective, rational, non-partisan, and
        interdisciplinary review of current drug policy, with
        emphasis on realistic and appropriate goals to be
        achieved in dealing with problems of harmful drug use and
        substance abuse. Devise reasonable and compassionate
        means of addressing such problems. </li>
    <li>Establish constructive dialogue on drug policy reform,
        taking care to adopt terminology which distinguishes
        between harms caused by substance abuse <i>per se</i> and
        those harms caused by drug control policies themselves. </li>
    <li>Avoid use of the &quot;drug problem&quot; as
        &quot;catch-all&quot; for other societal ailments, in an
        effort to engage in a rational and honest dialogue on the
        development of a responsible drug policy. </li>
    <li>Carefully analyze, for scientific validity, claims of
        causal nexus between use of controlled substances and
        specific criminal activities. </li>
    <li>In analyzing causes of &quot;drug-related&quot; crime,
        identify and distinguish between criminal activity caused
        by: (i) use or abuse of psychoactive substances; (ii) the
        lucrative black-market drug trade; and (iii)
        implementation of current drug policy. Devise realistic
        policies which reduce, rather than perpetuate violence
        and other criminal activity. </li>
    <li>Undertake an accurate, scientific analysis of the
        pharmacological makeup, uses and effects and dangers of
        any given drug (controlled or otherwise), in order to
        inform the determination of a rational and appropriate
        policy for regulation, use and treatment of such drug. </li>
    <li>Evaluate how policies presently employed, with emphasis
        on arrest, prosecution and incarceration, work either to
        provide assistance, or to cause further harm, to those
        individuals who use drugs, their families and
        communities. </li>
    <li>Commence constructive dialogue distinguishing between
        substance abuse and drug use generally, in order to
        develop appropriate and cost-effective goals and policies
        relating to government, medical or other intervention
        into lives of citizens, minimizing involuntary
        intervention absent clear and compelling necessity. </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="recommend6"></a>VI. Implement Public Education
Campaign on<br>
Drug Use and Substance Abuse</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Increase access to and availability of accurate
        information about the harms associated with types of drug
        use and of substance abuse. </li>
    <li>Provide access to information about safe use of
        controlled substances, in the absence of abstinence, and
        ways to reduce harms associated with such use. </li>
    <li>Counteract inaccurate, misleading and divisive &quot;drug
        war&quot; propaganda, which has characterized many drug
        education campaigns initiated by advocates of &quot;zero
        tolerance&quot; drug policy.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="recommend7"></a>VII. Decriminalize Marijuana</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Decriminalize marijuana, accepting that the economic and
        social costs of enforcing penal sanctions for possession
        of this relatively harmless drug can no longer be
        justified. </li>
    <li>If not decriminalized, where medically recommended,
        permit the medical use of marijuana and other controlled
        substances which have been determined by the medical
        community to be therapeutically beneficial.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="recommend8"></a>VIII. Reverse Encroachments on Civil
Rights and<br>
Restore &quot;Due Process of Law&quot;</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Repeal draconian sentencing laws for non-violent drug
        offenses, which deprive individuals of an opportunity to
        contest charges at trial due to risk of extensive and
        unreasonable periods of incarceration. </li>
    <li>In recognition of inherent rights to privacy and personal
        autonomy, reevaluate whether, and to what degree,
        government intervention is appropriate and justifiable
        with respect to casual use of drugs by its citizens. </li>
    <li>Restore a broader application of the U.S. Constitution's
        Fourth Amendment prohibition of unjustifiable search and
        seizure by government, eliminating the &quot;drug
        exception&quot; to the Constitution which has created
        unacceptable invasions of privacy and personal freedom. </li>
    <li>Severely curtail civil forfeiture laws, to permit
        government restraint of property only upon
        &quot;reasonable cause,&quot; and allow for forfeiture of
        only those assets directly traceable to criminal
        transactions, obtained as such with knowledge of the
        owner of the property to be forfeited, and which laws are
        enforceable only upon prior notice and with the
        meaningful right to contest, in accordance with &quot;due
        process of law&quot;.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="recommend9"></a>IX. Provide Alternative Social and
Economic<br>
Opportunity for Inner City Youth</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Declare war on causes of substance abuse, including:
        poverty; lack of education; lack of economic opportunity;
        family crises and; financial, emotional and physical
        instability. </li>
    <li>Utilize substantial savings anticipated from moving from
        cost-intensive &quot;penal based&quot; model of drug
        policy, to provide greater educational, vocational and
        recreational opportunities for youth at risk of becoming
        involved in the illegal drug trade. </li>
    <li>Expand and implement affirmative action programs designed
        to increase educational, economic and career
        opportunities for minority youth. </li>
    <li>Encourage public and private investment in poor
        communities to provide greater economic opportunities in
        the legitimate job market.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="recommend10"></a>X. End War on Youth and Inner City
Communities --<br>
Restore Confidence and Integrity in Government</h3>

<ul>
    <li>End discriminatory enforcement of drug laws in inner city
        communities, which fall most heavily on young people of
        color. </li>
    <li>Take measures to reduce violence associated with drug
        prohibition and the lucrative, illicit drug trade it
        fosters. </li>
    <li>Take measures to avoid placing police at &quot;war&quot;
        with inner city youth, as results from current drug laws
        and enforcement policies, and work to build positive
        alliances between police, minority communities and their
        youth. </li>
    <li>Restore confidence in government by having it assist and
        work with those in need, by creation of positive
        vocational, educational, recreational and other programs,
        in place of current emphasis upon arrests, prosecution
        and incarceration which prevails as a result of present
        drug policy. </li>
    <li>Equalize penal sanctions applicable to crack-cocaine
        users and powder-cocaine users, while reducing draconian
        penalties presently applicable to each. </li>
</ul>

1550; <i>also see</i> 21 U.S.C. 802, (regarding federal
criminal classification of presently designated controlled
substances). </p>

<p>Many of the more commonly known controlled substances were not
illegal or &quot;criminalized,&quot; until passage of the
Harrison Act of 1914. Marijuana was banned in 1937. Alcohol was
banned in 1920, although &quot;decriminalized,&quot; by repeal of
the 18th Amendment in 1933. While present drug policy has
statutory &quot;roots&quot; dating back 80 years, we regard
contemporary drug policy, as characterized by the emphasis on
&quot;stepped-up&quot; law enforcement efforts and enhanced penal
sanctions, a more recent development dating back three decades,
to the early 1970's. </p>

<p>2. <i>See</i> <b>National Household Survey on Drug Abuse</b>
(1993), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), which
reports that 12% of the total U.S. population, or 24 million
persons within the U.S., had used illicit drugs within the past
year. 77 million persons had used illicit drugs sometime during
their life. In a similar survey, conducted in 1994, it was found
that 10.8% of the total population, or 22.6 million persons had
used illicit drugs some time during the previous year. </p>

<p>Further, a U.S. General Accounting Office report, released in
1989, noted the following findings: that drug abuse in the United
States persisted at very high levels throughout the 1980's; that
the amount of cocaine consumed in the U.S. <i>doubled</i>, while
the price declined about 30%; that the price of heroin declined
20%, while the average purity of heroin sold had doubled; and
that marijuana, while its use declined, continued to be readily
available in most areas of the country. <i>See</i> James
Ostrowski, <i>Thinking About Drug Legalization</i>, <b>Cato
Institute Policy Analysis</b> (1989) at 28. Thus, notwithstanding
huge expenditures in waging the &quot;war on drugs,&quot; (<i>see</i>
Section IIA, <i>infra</i>), drug use remains widespread
throughout the nation, its costs have actually decreased and
potency increased. <i>See also</i>, Joseph B. Treaster, <i>Hospital
Data Show a Rise in Drug Abuse</i>, <b>New York Times</b>, July
9, 1992, at B1, (citing lower costs and greater purity of drugs,
together with more young sellers entering the drug market due to
unemployment, as reasons for upsurge in drug abuse in New York
City. Further reporting on New York State Office of Alcoholism
and Substance Abuse estimate of 200,000 heroin addicts in New
York City alone.) <i>See also</i> Association of the Bar of the
City of New York, <i>A Wiser Course: Ending Drug Prohibition</i>,
49 <b>The Record</b>, No. 5 (1994) at 544. Failures in ability of
U.S. to prevent production and importation of narcotics,
notwithstanding costly efforts, are also well documented. <i>See</i>
E. Nadelmann, <b>Cops Across Borders</b>, (1993). </p>

<p>3. In aid of more meaningful and objective analysis of what
has commonly been referred to as &quot;the drug problem,&quot;
care must be taken and appropriate distinctions made in using
terms such as: &quot;drug use,&quot; &quot;substance abuse,&quot;
&quot;drug-related crime,&quot; and &quot;drug-induced
crime.&quot; Definitions of these terms having been blurred in
the drug policy debate thus far, has led to a failure to properly
analyze and distinguish harms caused by drug use, substance
abuse, the drug-trade, and drug control policies themselves. </p>

<p>4. <i>See &quot;Public Health Consequences of Current Drug
Policy,&quot;</i> Section III, <i>infra</i>. </p>

<p>5. We acknowledge the reality, that forms of drug use and
other potentially harmful behavior have, and always will be,
engaged in by members of our society. Accordingly, we note that
policies based on &quot;zero tolerance&quot; are unrealistic,
unnecessarily harsh, and often counterproductive to reaching
those in need of assistance. </p>

<p>6. Alternative models of drug policy which merit consideration
include those incorporating principles of &quot;harm
reduction,&quot; which have received widespread acceptance among
drug policy experts and by various governments throughout the
world. &quot;Harm reduction&quot; strategies seek to analyze the
phenomenon of substance abuse in society by identifying and
isolating the actual societal harms caused by substance abuse, as
well as policies employed to defeat it, and attempting to reduce
those harms deriving from each. In seeking to reduce harms
associated with drug use, &quot;harm reduction&quot; strategies
include the expansion of needle exchange programs and methadone
clinics, and education on safe drug use for that segment of the
population who will continue to use harmful drugs. Meanwhile,
such policy redirects law-enforcement efforts from attempts to
eradicate all drug use, to concentration in areas where crime and
public disorder continue to occur. We find this approach to be
both more realistic and humane than present
&quot;zero-tolerance&quot; based policy, with all its attendant
costs, marginal results, and questionable use of available
resources. </p>

<p>7. From 1973 to 1993 the total number of inmates held in
prison and jail facilities throughout the U.S. <i>quadrupled</i>.
Having doubled from 1973 to 1983, the years from 1983 through
1993 saw the total number of prisoners held in the U.S. double
once again, from 660,800 to 1,408,685. During this period, the
number of incarcerated drug offenders rose 510%. It is estimated
that in 1990, when the number of individuals incarcerated in U.S.
jails and prison facilities reached 1.1 million, the cost of
incarcerating these individuals was approximately $20.3 billion,
with an anticipated need to <i>double</i> prison facilities in
the federal system. </p>

<p>In some states, such as New York, the figures are even more
startling, New York having seen its inmate population almost <i>triple</i>
during the period from 1981 through 1991. In only six years, from
1983 to 1989, the state saw the annual number of individuals
imprisoned for drug offenses grow 500%. By 1990, felony drug
convictions in New York represented 50% of all felony convictions
handed down by its state courts, up from 11.6% in 1980. As of
1992, New York State anticipated the need for eight new prisons,
at an approximate cost of $220 million to build one prison, and
$22.5 million per year each to operate -- totaling near term
costs of approximately $2.2 billion dollars. <i>See</i> Alan B.
Fischler, <i>The Incarceration of America</i>, <b>N.Y. Law
Journal</b>, November 6, 1992 at 2; Marc Mauer and Tracy Huling, <b>Young

<p>8. In 1991, the U.S. became the leading nation in the rate at
which it incarcerates its people. For instance, by 1991, 445 of
every 100,000 persons in the U.S. were imprisoned, a rate of
incarceration more than 2 to 3 times that of its closest
&quot;competitors&quot;, e.g. Canada and China each at 111 per
100,000, and Japan at 42 per 100,000. <i>See</i> M. Mauer, <b>Americans
Behind Bars: One Year Later</b>, The Sentencing Project (1992). </p>

<p>9. While some economic benefit is admittedly derived in those
communities where new prisons are built and to the corrections
personnel hired to staff these additional facilities, such
&quot;benefits,&quot; nevertheless, represent redirection of
increasingly limited public resources, and involve the much
greater costs associated with warehousing drug offenders. </p>

<p>10. One study noted that 62% of the children of incarcerated
women live more than 100 miles from the correctional facility,
and 47% lived 21-100 miles from the facility; Barbara Bloom, <b>Incarcerated
Mothers and Their Children: Maintaining Family Ties</b>, at
60-64. Overall, 54% of children whose mothers were incarcerated
never visited the prison facility; Barbara Bloom and David

76% of those women had at least one other family member with a
criminal record. 51% of the mothers of those women had felony
arrest records, most of which were drug related. </p>

<p>20. In New York, for example, a parent's substance abuse and
failure to cooperate with treatment is <i>prima facie</i>
evidence of &quot;neglect&quot; for the purposes of Family Court
abuse and neglect proceedings; Family Court Act 1046(a)(iii). </p>

<p>21. For example, New York State law imposes mandatory
reporting requirements on health care professionals, including
medical practitioners, social workers and counselors, requiring
them to report suspected child abuse and neglect to the Child
Welfare Administration. Since substance abuse is deemed a type of
&quot;child neglect&quot; (see note 20, above), this has a
widespread deterrent effect on access to health care by drug
users. With respect to fear of arrest and prosecution of women, <i>see

<p>23. A 1993 Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
study found that needle exchange programs are likely to reduce
HIV transmission and do not increase drug use. However, its
recommendations have not been followed because of, what we
believe to be, an irrational adherence to a &quot;zero
tolerance&quot; drug policy. <i>See</i> U.C.S.F. Institute for

Young, concluding, after extensive hearings on the medicinal

therapeutically active substances known to man&quot;); <i>id.</i>
at 6. Nadelmann further reports that, in the 11 states that
decriminalized marijuana during the 1970's, rates of consumption
were indistinguishable from rates in those states that had not;
and that, in the Netherlands, where cannabis was decriminalized
in 1976, consumption among young people had actually decreased
substantially. <i>See also</i> Robert W. Sweet, <i>The Abolition

notes that decriminalization of marijuana would take 850,000

<p>It is also noteworthy, as reported in J. Ostrowski, <i>Thinking

<p>28. It is well established that alcohol causes liver disease
and tobacco is a carcinogen. Additionally, alcohol use and abuse,
when combined with other activities, i.e., operation of a motor
vehicle, has more dangerous effects than most presently illegal
substances. Furthermore, alcohol abuse has been implicated in
increased incidence of violent behavior, including domestic
violence. While not advocating a return to &quot;alcohol
prohibition,&quot; we note that in the case of alcohol,
appropriate sanctions are imposed upon harmful activities
conducted while under the influence of this intoxicant, rather
than punishment for its consumption <i>per se</i>. The
comparative statistics are also quite poignant. Alcohol and
tobacco have been directly implicated in approximately 100,000
and 300,000 deaths per year, respectively. <i>See</i> R. Sweet, <i>The
Abolition of Prohibition -- on Drugs, that is, supra</i>, at 7,
and E. Nadelmann, <i>U.S. Drug Policy: A Bad Export</i>, <b>Foreign
Policy</b>, No. 70, at 92 (Spring, 1988). Meanwhile, according to
the National Council on Alcoholism, only 3,562 people were known
to have died in 1985 from use of all illegal drugs combined,
notwithstanding 1985 having been was one of the highest for <i>per
capita</i> drug consumption. <i>Id.</i> </p>

<p>29. Extensive research in to the potential therapeutic effects
of psychedelics has been conducted by the Multidisciplinary
Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS). </p>

<p>30. <i>See</i> L. Grinspoon and J. Bakalar, <b>Marihuana --
The Forbidden Medicine</b>, (1993). </p>

<p>31. In studying the causes of crime, use of the term
&quot;drug related&quot; is often unhelpful and even misleading,
as it fails to distinguish between those crimes actually caused
by drug use or substance abuse (i.e. &quot;drug induced,&quot;
meaning caused by the actual psychotropic experience, or mind
and/or physical alterations brought on by use of illicit drugs),
and those resulting from participation in the violent but
lucrative drug trade under circumstances of drug prohibition,
(i.e., &quot;drug trade&quot; or &quot;drug prohibition&quot;
related crime). </p>

<p>32. A comparable distinction might be made between
&quot;alcohol-induced&quot; crime (e.g., public disorder and
accentuated violent behavior, domestic or otherwise), and
&quot;alcohol trade&quot; or &quot;alcohol prohibition&quot;
related crime brought on by the era of prohibition (1920 to
1933), which included assaults and homicides -- resulting from
turf wars between rival bootleggers, shoot outs with law
enforcement officials, transactions gone bad, etc., extortion,
bribery, and sale of adulterated and poisonous liquor. This is
not to state, however, that all occasions of casual drug use
causes behavior which is harmful or sufficiently serious as to
justify intervention by the state, either by penal or
rehabilitative measures. <i>See</i> Robert W. Sweet and Edward A.
Harris, <i>Just and Unjust Wars: The War on the War on Drugs --
Some Moral and Constitutional Dimensions of the War on Drugs</i>,
(Book Review), <b>Northwestern University L. Rev.</b>, Vol 87,
No. 4, (Summer, 1993). </p>

<p>33. <i>See</i> Testimony of John P. Morgan, Professor of
Pharmacology, City University of New York Medical School, June
1994, at jointly sponsored public hearings of the New York County
Lawyers' Association and the Association of the Bar of the City
of New York. We note, parenthetically, that of the substances
which have been most directly related to violent and other forms
of anti-social behavior, alcohol rates most highly. This is not,
however, a &quot;controlled substance,&quot; as that term is
defined by criminal statutes, nor would the Task Force recommend
a return to &quot;prohibition&quot; of alcohol, based on the
lessons learned from that failed experiment. </p>

<p>34. Certain nations have succeeded in decreasing such
&quot;drug prohibition-related&quot; violence by easing
restrictions on use and, to some extent, on sale of certain
substances which are designated as &quot;controlled&quot; in the
United States. This has decreased, to a degree, the black market
activity and thereby, the cost and violence associated with
illegal drug trade. Examples include: the Netherlands, Australia
and the United Kingdom. </p>

<p>35. We cannot fail to note here that many involved in the drug
trade, particularly in our nation's cities, are not
&quot;hardened criminals,&quot; but rather, minority youth who
are understandably attracted to the possibilities of immediate
economic advancement through participation in the drug trade. For
despite its risks, engagement in the sale of drugs represents one
of the few avenues available to such individuals in a world which
appears to present limited economic opportunity. </p>

Assistant District Attorney, at jointly sponsored public hearings

<p>39. As reported in the U.S. Dept. Bureau of Justice, Bureau of
Justice Statistics, Bulletin, <i>Prisoners in 1993</i>: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;In 1992 . . . the number of new court commitments
    for drug offenses totaled an estimated 102,000 [up from 8,900
    in 1980, <i>ed.</i>]. The number of persons admitted for drug
    offenses was nearly as large as the number admitted for
    property offenses (104,300) and larger than the number for
    violent offenses (95,300 and public-disorder offenses
    (29,400). An estimated 30.5% of all new court commitments in
    1992 were drug offenders, up from 6.8% in 1980. . . .The
    increase in drug offenders admitted to prison accounted for
    nearly 46% of the total growth in new court commitments since
    1980. . . . The growth in the number of persons arrested for
    drug law violations and the increase in the rate of
    incarceration for drug offenses account for the change in the
    prison offense distribution. Between 1980 and 1992, the
    estimated number of adult arrests for drug law violations
    increased by 108% from 471,200 to 980,700.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The resulting shift in the percentage of drug offenders held
in U.S. prisons and jail, as compared to inmates incarcerated for
other criminal offenses, is as follows: In 1983, the total drug
offenders held in federal prisons represented 27.6% of the total
inmate population. By 1993, this figure rose to 60.8%. During
that same period, the percentage of drug offenders rose in state
prisons from 7.0% to 22.5%, and in local jails from 9.3% to
23.0%. Together with the shift in the makeup of jail and prison
populations, increased drug arrests and commitment of drug
offenders during this period has resulted in a <i>doubling</i> of
the total number of individuals incarcerated in the U.S., from
660,800 in 1983 to 1,408,685 in 1993. This figure <i>quadruples</i>
the number of those incarcerated in the U.S. in 1973, just 20
years ago; M. Mauer and Tracy Huling, <b>Young Black Americans
and the Criminal Justice System: Five Years Later</b>, The

<p>45. Actually, discussions of &quot;decriminalization&quot; or
&quot;legalization&quot; have always found wide currency,
particularly in present times, due to the overwhelming failure,
at huge cost, of a harsh law enforcement based strategy of drug
control. <i>See</i> Anthony Lewis, <i>End the War</i>, <b>New
York Times</b>, November 3, 1995, at A29; Jefferson Morely, <i>Crack
in Black and White</i>, <b>The Washington Post</b>, November 19,
1995, at C1. Further, we must be mindful that drug prohibition,
in its inception, began just 6 years prior to alcohol
prohibition, by passage of the Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914, a
bill with little popular support but urged by then Secretary of
State William Jennings Bryan, a man of &quot;deep prohibitionist
and missionary convictions...'&quot; J. Ostrowski, <i>&quot;Thinking
About Drug Legalization,&quot;</i> <b>Cato Institute Policy
Analysis</b>, No. 121, at 3 (1989). While drug control has taken
on its present character as a serious law enforcement priority
during the past three decades, ironically, this same period has
been one of unprecedented growth for the underworld, illegal drug
industry, in drug usage, and in the expenditure of economic
resources fighting a futile &quot;war on drugs.&quot; </p>

<p>46. M. Mauer and Tracy Huling, <b>Young Black Americans and
the Criminal Justice System: Five Years Later</b>, The Sentencing
Project (October, 1995). This recent report found that although
African Americans represent about 13% of the total population and
13% of those who are monthly drug users, they are 35% of those
arrested for drug possession, 55% of those convicted for drug
possession, and 74% of the total serving sentences of
incarceration for drug possession. <i>See also, 1 in 3 Young
Black Men in Justice System</i>, <b>Washington Post</b>, October
5, 1995, at 1. </p>

<p>47. Such operations are rarely conducted in predominantly
white, middle and upper-class neighborhoods. </p>

<p>48. According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, 90% of those
convicted in 1994 for federal crack offenses were black and 3.5%
were white. For powder cocaine, 29.7% were black and 25.9% were
white (the rest were Hispanic). Under current federal law, there
is a mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years imprisonment for
possession of 5 grams of crack or 500 grams of powder cocaine.
The Sentencing Commission's recent proposal to remove the
100-to-1 sentencing disparity was rejected by Congress, the
Justice Department and the Clinton Administration. <i>See</i> L.

<p>49. <i>See &quot;Effects of Contemporary Drug Policy on the
Integrity of Government,&quot;</i> Section VII, <i>infra</i>. </p>

<p>50. In the five years from 1989 to 1994, black, non-hispanic
women from the ages of 20 to 29, faced the highest growth in
criminal justice &quot;control rates,&quot; (i.e., incarcerated,
on parole or on probation) which increased 78% during this
period. In the five year period from 1986 to 1991, black,
non-hispanic women overall faced the highest growth in numbers of
those incarcerated in state prisons for drug offenses, with an
increase of 828% during this period. <i>See also</i> note 56, <i>infra</i>. </p>

Done: Women Drug Couriers and the Rockefeller Drug Laws</b>,

<p>52. For federal arrestees, the potential sentence after
conviction for similar crimes, under the Federal Sentencing
Guidelines, is 50 years-to-life. </p>

Punish Children?</b>, <i>supra</i>, at 3; <i>also see</i> M.
Mauer and Tracy Huling, <b>Young Black Americans and the Criminal
Justice System: Five Years Later</b>, The Sentencing Project
(1995). Regarding the general increase in the conviction and
incarceration of women for drug offenses, in 1991, 1 in 3 woman
in state prisons was incarcerated for a drug offense, up from 1
in 8 in 1986. From 1986 to 1991, the number of female state
prisoners incarcerated for drug offenses grew from 2,370 to
12,633, for an increase of 433%. <i>Id.</i> </p>

<p>In criminal statutes, &quot;delivery&quot; of narcotics, with
or without pecuniary compensation, is generally treated under the
more serious category of sale or distribution of such narcotics, <i>(see,
for example,</i> New York State Penal Law 220.00(1), which
defines sale of narcotics as: to &quot;sell, exchange, <i>give or
dispose of to another</i> or offer or agree to do the same.&quot; <i>(Emphasis
added.)</i> Although such criminal prosecutions against women are
not presently known to have been brought in New York State, they
have been, and continue to be brought in various states
throughout the nation, (<i>see</i> <b>Reproductive Freedom News</b>, <i>supra</i>). </p>

Justice Brennan enumerates cases in which the court failed to
question the &quot;chameleon-like way [in which the drug courier
profile] adapt[s] to any particular set of observations.&quot; </p>

<p>64. <i>See</i> S. Wisotsky, <b>A Society of Suspects: The War
on Drugs and Civil Liberties</b>, at 180 (1992). </p>

<p>65. The difficulty of establishing this negative proposition
is borne out by the government's own statistics, which reveal
that the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) made 14,430 domestic
seizures of nondrug property in 1993, resulting in a fiscal
windfall of approximately $670 million; <i>see</i> Drugs &amp;
Crime Data Center &amp; Clearinghouse, <b>Fact Sheet: Drug Data
Summary 2</b>, (April, 1994). </p>

<p>66. For example, in New York, pursuant to Real Property
Actions and Proceedings Law 715, the District Attorney can seek
fines and other sanctions against owners of such properties who
fail to commence eviction proceedings against tenants suspected
of illegal conduct, irrespective of the ability of the District
Attorney to bring or sustain criminal charges with respect to
such tenants. </p>

<p>67. We also note, with great concern, the conduct of various
governments outside our borders, both with and without direction
and encouragement provided by the United States, whose own
policies clearly take on world-wide significance. <i>See, e.g.</i>,
E. Nadelmann, <b>Cops Across Borders</b>, (1993). </p>

<p>68. As to the effect of federal drug sentencing laws in
compromising the threshold requirement that <i>mens rea</i> be
evident in the conduct of an individual defendant as an essential
element in imposing criminal responsibility, <i>see</i> Jack B.
Weinstein &amp; Fred A. Bernstein, <i>The Unwarranted Denigration
of Mens Rea on Drug Sentencing</i>, <b>Federal Sentencing
Reporter</b>, Vol. 7, No.3, (Nov/Dec 1994).</p>

<p><b>Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report</b> </p>

<p><b>NOTE BY MR. G. A. GRIERSON, C.I.E., MAGISTRATE AND
COLLECTOR, HOWRAH, ON REFERENCES TO THE HEMP PLANT OCCURRING IN
SANSKRIT AND HINDI LITERATURE</b></p>

<hr>

<p>I have the honour to state that I have searched through all
the Sanskrit and Hindi books accessible to me, and to forward the
accompanying note on the references to the hemp plant occurring
in the literatures of those languages.<br>
</p>

<p>I have met the hemp plant in Sanskrit and Hindi literature
under various names. The principal are:<br>
</p>

<p>(1) Bhanga. </p>

<p>(2) Indracana. </p>

<p>(3) Vijaya or Jaya<br>
</p>

<p>The earliest mention of the word ganja which I have noted is
dated about the year 1300 A.D.<br>
</p>

<p>Whenever the word vijaya is used, it is doubtful whether the
hemp plant is meant, or the yellow myrobolan, as the words means
both. <br>
</p>

<p>The name Bhanga occurs in the Atharvaveda (say, B.C. 1400).
The hemp plant is there mentioned simply as a sacred grass.
Panini (say, B.C. 300) mentions the pollen of the hemp flower
(bhanga). In the commencement of the sixth century we find the
first mention of vijaya which I have noted. It is a sacred grass,
and probably means here the hemp plant.<br>
</p>

<p>The first mention of bhanga as a medicine which I have noted
is in the work of Sucruta (before the eighth century A.D.), where
it is called an antiphlegmatic. During the next four centuries
bhanga (feminine) frequently occurs in native Sanskrit
dictionaries in the sense of hemp-plant.<br>
</p>

<p>In the tenth century the intoxicating nature of bhang seems to
have been known: and the name <i>Indracana</i>, Indra's food,
first appears, so far as I know, in literature. Its intoxicating
power was certainly known in the beginning of the fourteenth
century. In a play written in the beginning of the sixteenth
century, it is mentioned as being consumed by jogis (Caiva
mendicants). It is there named &quot;Indra's food.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>In later medical works it is frequently mentioned under
various names.<br>
</p>

<p>I append a more detailed account of the passages in which I
have noted the uses of the Indian hemp.<br>
</p>

<p>I may add that I have not traced in literature any difference
between the uses of the word ganja and the word bhanga, though
modern <i>kavirajas</i> tells me that they are distinct plants. <br>
</p>

<p>Cir. B.C. 1400. In the <i>Atharvaveda</i> (cir. 1400 B.C.) the
bhang plant is mentioned (11, 6, 15) once:<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;We tell of the five kingdoms of herbs headed by Soma;
may it and <i>kuca</i> grass, and <i>bhanga</i> and barley, and
the herb <i>saha</i> release us from anxiety.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>Here reference is evidently made to the offering of these
herbs in oblations.<br>
</p>

<p>The grammarian Panini (5, 2, 29) mentions <i>bhangukata</i>,
the pollen of the hemp flower, as one of his examples.<br>
</p>

<p>Cir. B. C. 300.<br>
</p>

<p>The fact that the pollen of this special flower was quoted is
worth noting.<br>
</p>

<p>Varahamihira in his <i>Brihatsamhita</i> (XLVIII, 39),
mentions <i>vijaya</i> as used with other grasses in the rotes of
the <i>Pusya</i>, bathing festival.<br>
</p>

<p>A.D. 504.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Vijaya</i> is this passage certainly means some plant or
other. The word may mean either the Indian hemp-plant or be a
synonym of <i>haritaki</i> (the yellow myrobolan). Dr. Hoernle
informs me that in the oldest medical words the word is explained
by commentators in the latter sense. It is doubtful what meaning
we are to adopt here. The word <i>may</i> mean the hemp-plant <i>bhanga</i>.
In the passage from the Atharvaveda, already quoted, amongst the
five plants special honoured as oblations, <i>bhanga</i> is
closely connected with the herb <i>saha</i>. So also in the
Brihatsamhita, <i>vijaya</i> is mentioned as one of a long list
of plants to be used in the offering, and the very next plant
mentioned is <i>saha</i>, which is apparently the same as <i>saha</i>.
This would encourage the theory that the <i>vijaya</i> of the
Brihatsamhita was more probably the same as the <i>bhanga</i> of
the Atbarvaveda. <br>
</p>

<p>In Sucruta (Ut. XI, 3) <i>Bhanga</i> is recommended together
with a number of other drugs as an antiphlegmatic.<br>
</p>

<p>Before the eighth century.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Vijaya</i> is mentioned in the same work as a remedy for
catarrh accompanied by diarrhea (Ut. XXIV, 20, and Ut. 39, page
415, 20), as an ingredient in a prescription for fever arising
from an excess of bile and phlegm. In these two passages,
however, <i>vijaya</i> is probably an equivalent of <i>haritaki</i>,
the yellow myrobolan, and does not mean hemp.<br>
</p>

<p>In the various <i>kosas</i>, or dictionaries, <i>bhanga</i> is
frequently mentioned as meaning the hemp-plant. Thus,<br>

</p>

<p>The <i>Sarasundari</i> (date not known to me), a commentary on
the Amarakosa mentioned above, </p>

<p>Twelfth century by Mathureca, and quoted in the
Cabdakalpadruma, mentions that the seed of the <i>bhanga</i>
plant is the size of that of millet (<i>kalaya</i>).<br>
</p>

<p>Cakrapanidatta is said to have flourished under Nayapala, a
prince who reigned </p>

<p>Cir. 1050 A.D. in the eleventh century A.D. In his <i>Cabdacandrika</i>,
a medical vocabulary, he gives the following Sanskrit names for
bhang:<br>
</p>

<p>(1) <i>Vijaya</i> (victorious), (2) <i>Trailokyavijaya</i>
(victorious in the three worlds), (3) <i>bhanga</i>, (4) <i>Indracana</i>
(Indra's food), (5) <i>Jaya</i> (victorious).<br>
</p>

<p>These names seem to show that its use as an intoxicant was
then known.<br>
</p>

<p>The <i>Rajanighantu</i> of Narahari Pandita adds the following
names to those given by </p>

<p>A.D. 1300. Cakrapanidatta in the <i>Cabdacandrika</i> above
mentioned: <br>
</p>

<p>(6) <i>Virapattra</i> (hero-leaved or the leaf of heroes), </p>

<p>(7) <i>Ganja</i>, </p>

<p>(8) <i>Capala</i> (the light-hearted), </p>

<p>(9) <i>Ajaya</i> (the unconquered), </p>

<p>(10) <i>Ananda</i> (the joyful), </p>

<p>(11) <i>Harsini</i> (the rejoicer)<br>
</p>

<p>and adds that the plant possesses the following qualities:<br>
</p>

<p>(1) <i>Katulva</i> (acridity); (2) <i>kasayatra</i>
(astringency); (3) <i>Usnatva</i> (heat); (4) <i>tiktatva</i>
(pungency); (5) <i>vatakaphapahatva</i> (removing wind and
phlegm); (6) <i>samgrahitva</i> (astringency); (7) <i>vakpradatva</i>
(speech-giving); (8)<i>balyatva</i> (strength-giving); (9) <i>medhakaritva</i>
(inspiring of mental power); (10) <i>cresthadipanatva</i> (the
property of a most excellent excitant).<br>
</p>

<p>The <i>Carngadhrasamhita</i>, a medical work by Carngadhara,
the date of which is unknown, </p>

<p>Say A.D. 1500. but which must have been compiled during the
Muhammadan </p>

<p>period of Indian History, specially mentions (1, 4, 19) <i>bhanga</i>
as an excitant (<i>vyavayin</i>). In the same passage it mentions
opium.<br>
</p>

<p>The <i>Dhurtasamagama</i>, or &quot;Rogues' Congress,&quot; is
the name of an amusing if coarsely </p>

<p>A.D. 1550. written farce of about the year 1500 A.D., the
author of </p>

<p>which was one Jyotirica. In the second act two Caiva
mendicants came before an unjust judge, and demand a decision on
a quarrel which they have about a nymph of the bazar. The judge
demands payment of a deposit before he will give any opinion. One
of the litigants says:<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;Here is my ganja bag; let it be accepted as a
deposit.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p>The Judge (<i>taking it pompously, and then smelling it
greedily</i>): &quot;Let me try what it is like (<i>takes a pinch</i>).
Ah! I have just now got by the merest chance some ganja which is
soporific and corrects derangements of the humours, which
produces a healthy appetite, sharpens the wits, and acts as an
aphrodisiac.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p>The word used for ganja in the above is <i>Indracana</i>
(Indra's food).<br>
</p>

<p>The <i>Bhavaprakaca</i>, another medical work written by
Bhavadevamicra (cir. A.D. 1600), has as follows:<br>
</p>

<p>Cir. A. D. 1600.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Bhanga ganja matulani madini vijaya jaya<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Bhanga kaphahari tikta grahini pacani laghuh<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Tiksosna pittala moha -mada vag vahni vardhini<br>
</i></p>

<p>&quot;Bhanga is also called <i>ganja, matulani, madini</i>
(the intoxicating), <i>vijaya</i> (the victorious), and <i>jaya</i>
(the victorious). It is antiphlegmatic, pungent, astringent,
digestive, easy of digestion, acid, bile-affecting; and increases
infatuation, intoxication, the power of the voice, and the
digestive faculty.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p>&quot;The <i>Rajavallabha, a materia medica</i>, by
Narayanadasa kaviraja, the date of which I </p>

<p>17th century. do not know, but which is quoted in the <i>Cabdakalpadruma,
and</i> is believed to be ancient, has the following:<br>
</p>

<p><i>Cakra-canam tu tiksno-snam moha-krit kustha-nacanam<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Bala-medha-gni-krit-clesma -dosa-hari rasayanam<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Jata mandara-manthanaj jala-nidhau piyusa-rupa pura<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Trailokye vijaya-prade 'ti vijaya cri-devaraja-priya<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Lokanam hita-kamyaya ksiti-tale prapta naraih kamada<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Sarva-&quot; tanka-vinaca-harsa-janani yaih sevita sarvada.
<br>
</i></p>

<p>&quot;Indra's food (i.e. ganja) is acid, produces infatuation,
and destroys leprosy. It creates vital energy, the mental powers,
and internal heat, corrects irregularities of the phlegmatic
humour, and is an elixir vitae. It was originally produced, like
nectar, from the ocean by the churning with Mount Mandara, and
inasmuch as it gives victory in the three worlds, it, the delight
of the king of the gods, is called <i>vijaya</i>, the victorious.
This desire-fulfilling drug was obtained by men on the earth,
through desire for the welfare of all people. To those who
regularly use it it begets joy and destroys every anxiety.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>The <i>Rasapradhipa</i>, a work, the date of which is unknown
to me, and which is quoted in </p>

<p>? Date. the <i>Cabdakalpadruma</i> mentions <i>jaya</i> as a
remedy for indigestion:<br>
</p>

<p><i>Ksaratrayam sutagandhou pancakolam idam cubham<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Sarvais tulya jaya bhrista tad-ardha cigruja jata<br>
</i></p>

<p>Natron, saltpetre and borax, mercury and sulphur, and the
prosperous five spices (long pepper, its root, <i>piper chaba</i>,
another pepper, and dry ginger). To these add an equal amount of
parched <i>jaya</i> and half of that amount of horse-radish (<i>moringa</i>)
and <i>jata</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>It is not certain whether <i>jaya</i> here means bhang or <i>Haritaki</i>
(yellow myrobolan). The word has both significations. The latter,
perhaps, suits the formula best.<br>
</p>

<p>In the <i>Rasaratna-samuccaya</i>, a work written in the south
of India, <i>jaya</i> is classified as a semi-poison,<br>
</p>

<p><i>Langoli visamustic ca karaviro jaya tatha<br>
</i></p>

<p>? Date<br>
</p>

<p><i>Tilakah kanako rkac ca vargo hy upavisatmakah.<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Langali</i> (Vanguiera spinosa), the root of the Nerium
odorum, <i>jaya</i> (Symplocos racemosa) <i>kanaka</i> and <i>ak</i>
(a kind of Euphorbia), are semi-poisonous.<br>
</p>

<p>Bhang is frequently mentioned by vernacular poets. The oldest
instance with which I </p>

<p>1400 A.D. am acquainted is the well-known hymn by Vidyapati </p>

<p>Tbakur (1400 A.D.), in which he calls Civa &quot;<i>Digambara
bhanga</i>,&quot; in reference to his habit of consuming that
drug. According to an old Hindu poem, on which I cannot now lay
my hands, Civa himself brought down the bhang plant from the
Himalayas and gave it to mankind. Jogis are well-known consumers
of bhang and ganja, and they are worshippers of Civa.<br>
</p>

<p>In folk-songs, ganja or bhang (with or without opium) is the
invariable drink of heroes before performing any great feat. At
the village of Bauri in Gaya there is a huge hollow stone, which
is said to be the bowl in which the famous hero Lorik mixed his
ganja. Lorik was a very valiant general, and is the hero of
numerous folk-songs. The epic poem of Alha and Rudal, or
uncertain date, but undoubtedly based on very old materials (the
heroes lived in the twelfth century A.D.), contains numerous
references to ganja as a drink of warriors. For instance, the
commencement of the canto dealing with Alha's marriage, describes
the pestle and mortar with which the ganja was prepared, the
amount of the intoxicating drink prepared from it (it is called <i>sabzi</i>)
and the amount of opium (an absurdly exaggerated quantity) given
to each warrior in his court.<br>
</p>

<p>That the consumption of bhang is not considered disreputable
among Rajputs may be gathered from the fact that Ajabes, who was
court poet to the well-known Maharaja Bishwanath Singh of Riwa,
wrote a poem praising bhang and comparing <i>siddhi</i> to the
&quot;success&quot; which attends the worshipper of
&quot;Hari.&quot; Here there is an elaborate series of puns. The
word <i>siddhi</i> means literally 'success,' and <i>hari</i>
means not only the god Hari, but also bhang. </p>

<p>NOTE BY BABU ABHILAS CHANDRA MUKERJI, SECOND INSPECTOR OF
EXCISE, BENGAL, ON THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF TRINATH WORSHIP IN
EASTERN BENGAL.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Date of origin</i>._In 1867 Babu Ananda Chandra Kali or
Kailai, of Dhamrai, a village in thana Sabhar of the Dacca
district, first started the worship at the house of his
father-in-law at Fattehpur in the Atia pargana of the Mymensingh
district (sub-division Tangail). <br>
</p>

<p><i>Antecedents of the originator</i>._Dhamrai is an important
village in the Dacca district noted for its car festival, which
is annually held in honor of a local idol named <i>Madhab Thakur</i>,
and which is witnessed by a large gathering of people.<br>
</p>

<p>Ananda Chandra received education at the Dacca Normal School.
After leaving school he served for some time as a pundit
(schoolmaster), and then entered the Police Department, but was
there only a short time. He is a Barendra Brahman and belongs to
a respectable family. He learnt to smoke ganja when he was only a
boy. His present age is 60 years. He has the reputation of being
a versifier. He smokes two pice worth of ganja every day.<br>
</p>

<p>He married at Fattehpur in the Mymensingh district. There he
introduced Trinath worship 27 years ago. A <i>panchali</i> (poem)
reciting the praises and exploits of Trinath was first published
at Dacca in 1871 and the first edition (1,000 copies) was sold in
a few months.<br>
</p>

<p><i>The circumstances under which the worship was first started</i>._Ananda
Chandra Kali was at the time living in the house of his
father-in-law. He was thinking of introducing the worship of a
common god, who might be worshipped by all classes, rich and
poor, Brahman and Chandal, and by all creeds, Saktas, Baishnavas,
and Shaivas, and the idea occurred to him of having the present
worship at which ordinary and inexpensive things, such as ganja,
oil, and betel-leaf, were alone to be used.<br>
</p>

<p>Trinath (from Sanskrit <i>Tri</i>, three, and <i>Nath</i>,
lord) is represented to be Brahma, Bishnu and Shiva, the Hindu
Trinity in one.<br>
</p>

<p>Being a ganja-smoker himself, Ananda Kali may have also
thought that by introducing the worship he would be able to save
the ganja-smokers from disrepute, as then ganja could be consumed
in the name of a god and under colour of doing a religious or
pious act.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Religious aspect of the worship</i>._The following
translation of the Introduction to the <i>Trinath Mela</i>
Panchali gives some idea of the subject:<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;The universe consists of the earth, the heaven, and the
nether world, and Trinath is the lord of these three worlds.<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;There was an incarnation of God in the form of Gour
(Chaitanya), who delivered the sinners by preaching the name of
Hari, but the Lord was not satisfied with this, and became
concerned for the created, and soon he became incarnate again.
Brahma, Bishnu and Shiva, gods in three forms, manifested
themselves in one form. The one God, the Lord of the universe,
seeing the miseries of mankind, came to their deliverance. Ananda
(Ananda Chandra Kali, the originator) declares that the true and
sincere worshippers of Trinath are sure to obtain salvation.
Brahma, Bishnu, and Shiva met together and expressed their desire
to come to this world in one form to receive worship.<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;He is a truly pious man who worships Trinath, and
blessings are showered on the worshipper.<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;The worship should be made in a form in which the rich
and the poor may equally join and may perform it easily.<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;Only three things, each worth one pice, are required for
this <i>puja</i> (form of worship). The things which please all
must be selected. The offering should consist of <i>siddhi</i>
(ganja), <i>pan</i> (betel-leaf), and oil, each worth one pice. <br>
</p>

<p>&quot;The votaries should assemble at night and worship with
flowers. The ganja should be washed in the manner in which people
wash ganja for smoking. The worshipper must fill three <i>chillums</i>
with equal quantities of ganja, observing due awe and reverence.
When all the worshipers are assembled the lamp should be lit with
three wicks, and the praises of Trinath should be sung. As long
as the wicks burn, the god should be worshipped and his praises
chanted. The god should be reverentially bowed to at the close of
the puja. When the reading of the <i>Panchali</i> is finished,
those that will not show respect to the <i>Prasad</i> (the
offering which has been accepted by the god), <i>i.e. chillum</i>
of ganja, shall be consigned to eternal hell, and the sincere
worshippers shall go to heaven.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p><i>How the worship spread</i>._Ananda Kali commenced the puja
with the aid of some ganja-smokers in the village of Fattehpur. A
large number of people consume ganja in the Dacca. </p>

<p>NOTE BY MR. J.M. CAMPBELL, C.I.E., COLLECTOR OF LAND REVENUE
AND CUSTOMS AND OPIUM, BOMBAY, ON THE RELIGION OF HEMP<br>
</p>

<p>To the Hindu the hemp plant is holy. A guardian lives in the
bhang leaf. As the wife of Vishnu, the preserver, lives in the
hysteria-curing <i>tulsi</i>, or Holy Basil, and as Shiva dwells
in the hysteria-curing <i>bel</i>, gle marmelos, so the
properties of the bhang plant, its power to suppress the
appetites, its virtue as a febrifuge, and its thought-bracing
qualities show that the bhang leaf is the home of the great Yogi
or brooding aascetics Mahadev.<br>
</p>

<p>So holy a plant should have special rearing. Shiva explains to
his wife, Parvati, how, in sowing hemp seed, you should keep
repeating the spell 'Bhangri,' 'Bhangi,' apparently that the
sound of that guardian name may scare the evil tare-sowing
influences. Again, when the seedlings are planted the same holy
name must be repeated, and also at the watering which, for the
space of a year, the young plants must daily receive. When the
flowers appear the flowers and leaves should be stripped from the
plant and kept for a day in warm water. Next day, with one
hundred repetitions of the holy name Bhangri, the leaves and
flowers should be washed in a river and dried in an open shed.
When they are dry some of the leaves should be burnt with due
repeating of the holy name as a <i>jap</i> or muttered charm.
Then, bearing in mind Vagdevata, or the goddess of speech, and
offering a prayer, the dried leaves should be laid in a pure and
sanctified place. Bhang so prepared, especially if prayers are
said over it, will gratify the wishes and desires of its owner.
Taken in the early morning such bhang cleanses the user from sin,
frees him from the punishment of crores of sins, and entitles him
to reap the fruits of a thousand horse-sacrifices. Such
sanctified bhang taken at daybreak or noon destroys disease.
Before the religious user of bhang stand the Ashtadevata or Eight
Guardians with clasped hands ready to obey him and perform his
orders. The wish of him who with pure mind pours bhang with due
reverence over the Ling of Mahadev will be fulfilled.<br>
</p>

<p>Such holiness and such evil-scaring powers must give bhang a
high place among lucky objects. That a day may be fortunate the
careful man should on waking look into liquid bhang. So any
nightmares or evil spirits that may have entered into him during
the ghost-haunted hours of night will flee from him at the sight
of the bhang and free him from their blinding influences during
the day. So too when a journey has to be begun or a fresh duty or
business undertaken it is well to look at bhang. To meet some one
carrying bhang is a sure omen of success. To see in a dream the
leaves, plant, or water of bhang is lucky; it brings the goodness
of wealth into the dreamer's power. To see his parents worship
the bhang-plant and pour bhang over Shiva's Ling will cure the
dreamer of fever. A longing for bhang foretells happiness: to see
bhang drunk increases riches. No good thing can come to the man
who treads under foot the holy bhang leaf.<br>
</p>

<p>So evil-scaring and therefore luck-bringing a plant must play
an important part in the rites required to clear away evil
influences. During the great spirit time of marriage in Bombay
among almost all the higher classes of Gujarat Hindus, of the
Jain as well as of the Brahmanic sects, the supplies sent by the
family of the bride to the bridegroom's party during their seven
days' sojourn includes a supply of bhang. The name of the father
who neglects to send bhang is held in contempt. Again, after the
wedding, when the bridegroom and his friends are entertained at
the house of the bride, richly-spiced bhang is drunk by the
guests. The Gujarat Musalman bride before and after marriage
drinks a preparation of bhang. Among the Pardeshi or North Indian
Hindus of Bombay bhang is given not only at weddings, but the
Pardeshi who fails to give his visitor bhang is despised by his
caste as mean and miserly. Another great spirit time during which
bhang plays an important part is the time of war. Before the
outbreak of a war and during its progress the Ling of Mahadev
should be bathed with bhang. Its power of driving panic
influences from near the god has gained for bhang the name of
Vijaya, the unbeaten. So a drink of bhang drives from the
fighting Hindu the haunting spirits of fear and wariness. So the
beleagured Rajput, when nothing is left but to die, after loosing
his hair that the bhang spirit may have free entrance, drinks the
sacramental bhang and rushing on the enemy completes his <i>juhar</i>
or self-sacrifice. It is this quality of panic-scaring that makes
bhang, the Vijaya or Victorious, specially dear to Mahadev in his
character of Tripur, the slayer of the demon Tripurasur. As Shiva
is fond of <i>bel</i> leaves, as Vishnu is fond of <i>tulsi</i>
leaves, so is Tripuresvar fond of bhang leaves. He who wishes to
obtain his desires must constantly offer bhang to Tripuresvar.<br>
</p>

<p>Bhang the cooler is a febrifuge. Bhang acts on the fever not
directly or physically as an ordinary medicine, but indirectly or
spiritually by soothing the angry influences to whom the heats of
fever are due. According to one account in the Ayurveda, fever is
possession by the hot angry breath of the great gods Brahma,
Vishnu, and shiva. According to another passage in the Ayurveda,
Shankar or Shiva, enraged by a slight from his father-in-law
Daksha, breathed from his nostrils the eight fevers that wither
mankind. If the fever-stricken performs the Viraya abhishek, or
bhang-pouring on the Ling of Shankar, the god is pleased, his
breath cools, and the portion of his breath in the body of the
fever-stricken ceases to inflame. The Kashikhanda Purana tells
how at Benares, a Brahman, sore-smitten with fever, dreamed that
be had poured bhang over the self-sprung Ling and was well. On
waking he went to the Ling, worshipped, poured bhang and
recovered. The fame of this cure brings to Benares sufferers from
fever which no ordinary medicine can cure. The sufferers are laid
in the temple and pour bhang over the Ling whose virtue has
gained it the name Jvareshwar, the Fever-Lord. In Bombay many
people sick of fever vow on recovery to pour bhang over a Ling.
Besides as a cure for fever bhang has many medicinal virtues. It
cools the heated blood, soothes the over-wakeful to sleep, gives
beauty, and secures length of days. It cures dysentery and
sunstroke, clears phlegm, quickens digestion, sharpens appetite,
makes the tongue of the lisper plain, freshens the intellect, and
gives alertness to the body and gaiety to the mind. Such are the
useful and needful ends for which in his goodness the Almighty
made bhang. In this praise of the hemp the Makhzan or great
Greek-Arab work on drugs joins. Ganja in excess causes abscess,
even madness. In moderation bhang is the best of gifts. Bhang is
a cordial, a bile absorber, an appetiser, a prolonger of life.
Bhang quickens fancy, deepens thought, and braces judgment. <br>
</p>

<p>As on other guardian-possessed objects, the cow, the Vedas, or
the leaf of the <i>bel</i> tree, oaths are taken on the bhang
leaf. Even to a truthful witness an oath on the bhang leaf is
dreaded. To one who foreswears himself the bhang oath is death. <br>
</p>

<p>So holy a plant must play a leading part in temple rites.
Shiva on fire with the poison churned from the ocean was cooled
by bhang. At another time enraged with family worries the god
withdrew to the fields. The cool share of a plant soothed him. He
crushed and ate of the leaves, the bhang refreshed him. For these
two benefits bhang is Shankarpriya, the beloved of Mahadev. So
the right user of bhang or of ganja, before beginning to drink or
to smoke, offers the drug to Mahadev saying, lena Shankar, lena
Babulnath: be pleased to take it Shankar, take it Babulnath.
According to the Shiva Purana, from the dark fourteenth of Magh
(January-February) to the light fourteenth of Asbadh (July-July),
that is, during the three months of the hot weather, bhang should
be daily poured over the Ling of Shiva. If not every day, bhang
should be poured at least during the first and last days of this
period. According to the Meru Tantra on any Monday, especially on
Shravan (July-August) Mondays, on all twelfths or <i>pradoshs</i>,
and on all dark fourteenths of <i>shivratris</i>, still more on
the Mahashivratri or Shiva's Great Night on the dark fourteenth
of Magh (January-February), and at all eclipses of the sun or
moon, persons wistful either for this world or for the world to
come should offer bhang to Shiva and pour it over the Ling. Not
every devotee of Shiva makes offerings of bhang. Such rites in
Bombay are seldom performed except in the Bhuleswar and Babulnath
temples and there only on special occasions. The bhang offered to
Mahadev is without pepper or other spice. It is mixed with water,
water and milk, or milk and sugar. It is poured over the Ling.
According to some authorities the offerer should not touch the
offered bhang. Temple ministrants Atits, Tapodhans, Bhojaks,
Bhopis, Bharadis, Guravas alone should drink it. If there are no
ministrants the remains of the offering should be poured into a
well or given to cows to drink. Other authorities encourage the
offerer to sip the bhang, since by sipping the bhang reaches and
soothes the Shiva-Shakti or Shiva-spirit in the sipper. On
certain special occasions during failures of rain, during
eclipses, and also in times of war libations of bhang are poured
over the Ling.<br>
</p>

<p>Vaishnavas as well as Shaivas make offerings of bhang. The
form of Vishnu or the Guardian to whom bhang is a welcome
offering is Baladev, Balaram, or Dauji, the elder brother of
Krishna. Baladev was fond of spirits, not of bhang. But Banias,
Bhatias, and other high class Hindus, not being able to offer
spirits, instead of spirits present bhang. In Bombay the offering
of bhang to Baladev, unlike the special offerings to Shiva, is a
common and every-day rite. Without an offering of bhang no
worship of Baladev is complete. Unlike the plain or milk and
sugared bhang spilt over the Ling, Baladev's bhang is a
richly-spiced liquid which all present, including the offerer,
join in drinking. Such social and religious drinking of bhang is
common in Bombay in the temple of dauji in Kalyan Kirparam lane
near Bhuleshwar. As in the higher class worship of Baladev the
liquor offering has been refined into an offering of bhang so it
is in the worship of Devi, Shiva's early and terrible consort. On
any Tuesday or Friday, the two weeks days sacred to Devi, still
more during the Navratra or Nine Nights in Ashwin or
September-October, those whose caste rules forbid liquor make a
pleasing spiced bhang. And as in the worship of Baladev all
present, worshipper and ministrant alike, join in drinking.
Shitaladevi, the Cooler, the dread goddess of small-pox, whose
nature, like the nature of bhang, is cooling, takes pleasure in
offerings of bhang. During epidemics of small-pox the burning and
fever of the disease are soothed by pouring bhang over the image
of Shitaladevi. So for the feverishness caused by the heats
especially to the old no cure equals the drinking of bhang.
Unlike spirits the tempter to flesh bhang the craver for milk is
pleasing to the Hindu religion. Even according to the straitest
school of the objectors to stimulants, while to a high caste
Hindu the penalty for liquor-drinking is death, no penalty
attached to the use of bhang, and a single day's fast is enough
to cleanse from the coarser spirit of <i>ganja</i>. Even among
those who hold stimulants to be devil-possessed penalty and
disfavour attach to the use of hemp drugs only when they are
taken with no religious object and without observing the due
religious rites.<br>
</p>

<p>At the other extreme of Hindu thought from the foes to
stimulants, to the worshippers of the influences that, raising
man out of himself and above mean individual worries, make him
one with the divine force of nature, it is inevitable that
temperaments should be found to whom the quickening spirit of
bhang is the spirit of freedom and knowledge. In the ecstasy of
bhang the spark of the Eternal in man turns into light the
murkiness of matter or illusion and elf is lost in the central
soul-fire. The Hindu poet of Shiva, the Great Spirit that living
in bhang passes into the drinker, sings of bhang as the clearer
of ignorance, the giver of knowledge. No gem or jewel can touch
in value bhang taken truly and reverently. He who drinks bhang
drinks Shiva. The soul in whom the spirit of bhang finds a home
glides into the ocean of Being freed from the weary round of
matter-blinded self. To the meaner man, still under the glamour
of matter or <i>maya</i>, bhang taken religiously is kindly
thwarting the wiles of his foes and giving the drinker wealth and
promptness of mind.<br>
</p>

<p>In this devotion to bhang, with reverence, not with the
worship, which is due to Allah alone, the North Indian Mussalman
joins hymning the praises of bhang. To the follower of the later
religion of Islam the holy spirit in bhang is not the spirit of
the Almighty. It is the spirit of the great prophet Khizr or
Elijah. That bhang should be sacred to Khizr is natural. Khizr is
the patron saint of water. Still more Khizr means green, the
revered colour of the cooling water of bhang. So the Urdu poet
sings 'When I quaff fresh bhang I liken its colour to the fresh
light down of thy youthful beard.' The prophet Khizr or the Green
prophet cries 'May the drink be pleasing to thee.' Nasir, the
great North Indian Urdu poet of the beginning of the present
century, is loud in the praises of his beloved Sabzi, the Green
one. 'Compared with bhang spirit are naught. Leave all things
thou fool, drink bhang.' From its quickening the imagination
Musalman poets honour bhang with the title <i>Warak al Khiyall</i>,
Fancy's Leaf. And the Makhzan or great Arab-Greek drug book
records many other fond names for the drug. Bhang is the
Joy-giver, the Sky-flier, the Heavenly-guide, the Poor Man's
Heaven, the Soother of Grief.<br>
</p>

<p>Much of the holiness of bhang is due to its virtue of clearing
the head and stimulating the brain to thought. Among ascetics the
sect known as Atits are specially devoted to hemp. No social or
religious gathering of Atits is complete without the use of the
hemp plant smoked in ganja or drink in bhang. To its devotee
bhang is no ordinary plant that became holy from its guardian and
healing qualities. According to one account, when nectar was
produced from the churning of the ocean, something was wanted to
purify the nectar. The deity supplied the want of a
nectar-cleanser by creating bhang. This bhang Mahadev made from
his own body, and so it is called <i>angaj</i> or body-born.
According to another account some nectar dropped to the ground
and from the ground the bhang plant sprang. It was because they
used this child of nectar or of Mahadev in agreement with
religious forms that the seers or Rishis became Siddha or one
with the deity. He who, despite the example of the Rishis, uses
no bhang shall lose his happiness in this life and in the life to
come. In the end he shall be cast into hell. The mere sight of
bhang cleanses from as much sin as a thousand horse-sacrifices or
a thousand pilgrimages. He who scandalises the user of bhang
shall suffer the torments of hell so long as the sun endures. He
who drinks bhang foolishly or for pleasure without religious
rites is as guilty as the sinner of <i>lakhs</i> of sins. He who
drinks wisely and according to rule, be he ever so low, even
though his body is smeared with human ordure and urine, is Shiva.
No god or man is as good as the religious drinker of bhang. The
students of the scriptures at Benares are given bhang before they
sit to study. At Benares, Ujjain, the other holy places yogis,
bairagis and sanyasis take deep draughts of bhang that they may
centre their thoughts on the Eternal. To bring back to reason an
unhinged mind the best and cleanest bhang leaves should be boiled
in milk and turned to clarified butter. Salamisri, saffron, and
sugar should be added and the whole eaten. Besides over the demon
of Madness bhang is Vijaya or victorious over the demons of
hunger and thirst. By the help of bhang ascetics pass days
without food or drink. The supporting power of bhang has brought
many a Hindu family safe through the miseries of famine. To
forbid or even seriously to restrict the use of so holy and
gracious a herb as the hemp would cause widespread suffering and
annoyance and to the large bands of worshipped ascetics
deep-seated anger. It would rob the people of a solace in
discomfort, of a cure in sickness, of a guardian whose gracious
protection saves them from the attacks of evil influences, and
whose mighty power makes the devotee of the Victorious,
overcoming the demons of hunger and thirst, of panic fear, of the
glamour of Maya or matter, and of madness, able to rest to brook
on the Eternal, till the Eternal, possessing him body and soul,
frees him from the haunting of self and receives him into the
ocean of Being. These beliefs the Musalman devotee shares to the
full. Like his Hindu brother the Mussalman fakir reveres bhang as
the lengthener of life, the freer from the bonds of self. Bhang
brings union with the Divine Spirit. 'We drank bhang and the
mystery I am He grew plain. So grand a result, so tiny a sin.'<br>

<h1>The Facts About Drug Abuse </h1>

<p> <b>The Drug Abuse Council, 1980</b> </p>

<p> <font size="5">Final Report Of The Drug Abuse Council</font> </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"> </p>

<p> IN 1972 <i>Dealing with Drug Abuse: A Report to the Ford
Foundation </i>concluded that the national drug policies at that
time were not effective and were not likely to eliminate or even
greatly affect &quot;drug abuse.&quot; That report, describing
the complex nature of psychoactive drug use and misuse,
identified flaws in programs and laws which had been designed to
reduce the harm to individuals and society of the indiscriminate,
nonmedical use of psychoactive drugs. Public policy was found to
be unrealistic and unresponsive to cultural, social,
psychological, and economic factors underlying the widespread use
of drugs. </p>

<p> The report to the Ford Foundation was issued at the end of a
decade of increasing drug use and increasing concern about such
use. Drugs seemed to be everywhere; a generation of young
Americans had been urged to &quot;turn on, tune in, and drop
out&quot; with a wide variety of mood-altering drugs. The United
States was described as a nation of &quot;pill poppers. &quot;
Deeply held public fears were heightened as city after city
reported heroin addiction of epidemic proportions. From suburban
neighborhoods, long considered secure and stable, came reports of
heroin experimentation by high school students from middle- and
upper-income families. Thousands of American soldiers in Vietnam
were said to be addicted to heroin. New words and
phrases-&quot;pot,&quot; &quot;downers,&quot; &quot;uppers,&quot;
drug &quot;trips&quot;-became part of the popular vocabulary. </p>

<p> In 1972 it was estimated that between three- and six-hundred
thousand Americans-the vast majority of whom were said to be
inner-city blacks and Hispanics-were addicted to heroin. Nearly
25 million Americans were reported to have tried marijuana and 10
million were said to use it regularly. Millions of others
regularly used stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens, and
tranquilizers for non-medical purposes. However, alcohol and
nicotine continued to be the most widely used and misused drugs
illicit drugs-marijuana, heroin, and cocaine in particular-were
singled out for attention, yet the misuse of legally available
drugs was often ignored. While various methods or approaches for
&quot;solving the drug problem&quot; were presented, confusion
prevailed. Drug issues, particularly that of the relationship
between drug use and crime, were constantly publicized and
politicized. Many Americans thought the increase in street crime
during the late 1960s resulted largely from illicit drug use and
therefore responded enthusiastically to calls for a war on drugs
to keep illicit drugs and their users apart. Heroin was labelled
&quot;Public Enemy Number One.&quot; New &quot;get tough&quot;
laws were proposed, and many were enacted. Hundreds of millions
of dollars were appropriated for programs to stiffen law
enforcement, improve public education, and expand treatment
efforts. </p>

<p> At the height of public concern in 1972, <i>Dealing with </i>Drug
Abuse urged caution and restraint. It called for a climate of
reason which would permit identification of the real risks of
drug misuse and rejection of policies and programs based on
misinformation and sensationalism. It pointed out that drug use
and drug problems were not new but have persisted throughout
history, not only in the United States but in many other
countries, cultures, and societies as well. It noted that
knowledge about the causes of drug misuse was inadequate, as was
knowledge about its -grevention and treatment. Moreover, the
report revealed much of what was then accepted as fact to be
erroneous, out of date, or misleading. </p>

<p> The authors of <i>Dealing with Drug Abuse, </i>the sponsoring
private organizations which funded the Drug Abuse Council, and,
subsequently, the council's board of directors perceived a
pressing need for independent analyses of public drug policies
and programs. They felt that lawmakers and public officials,
particularly in the federal government, were reacting to
drug-related problems from a limited, crisis-oriented perspective
when a longer-range view was necessary, and that the
effectiveness of law enforcement and treatment strategies was
often overstated by public officials, which led to unrealistic
expectations of rapid and sweeping solutions. Thus these
individuals and groups agreed to sponsor an independent
organization capable of providing the public with a less
emotional, more apolitical perspective. As a result the Drug
Abuse Council was established in early 1972. </p>

<p> As of this writing, the Drug Abuse Council has been in
existence for nearly seven years. During this time the council
has, through staff-directed projects, research grants, and
contracts, assessed many aspects of the use and misuse of
psychoactive drugs.2 This work has been undertaken with the
unhampered view and resources of a national, independent,
nonprofit, nongovernmental organization. </p>

<p> The council has had resources sufficient to examine
drug-related issues in depth and over time. It began by analyzing
the assumptions underlying public perceptions and policies. It
examined the accepted knowledge of the interaction of chemical
substances with the human body and mind. It studied various
aspects of contemporary society to identify socioeconomic and
cultural factors relating to drug use and misuse. The council has
reviewed and assessed laws, programs, and projects-federal,
state, and local; governmental and private-which have been
adopted in response to psychoactive drug use and misuse. </p>

<p> In pursuit of its efforts to learn more about drug use and
misuse, the council gathered information from public officials,
scientists, historians, and law enforcement and treatment program
personnel. It canvassed widely and deeply the experiences and
views of current and former drug users, of minority groups and
individuals, and of other informed or concerned persons. </p>

<p> The council has periodically published its findings on many
aspects of drugs and has sought to bring about changes in
policies and programs it considers unsound. Through these
activities, it has sought to provide leadership in the private
sector. </p>

<p> When operations began in 1972, a five-year period of activity
was planned. In the fifth year, the board of directors decided to
continue some of the council's functions for an additional two
years. Now, as this seven year period comes to an end, we feel a
responsibility to share our major observations, findings, and
suggestions for the future in the form of a final report. </p>

<p> This final report consists of two major sections: first, the
report of the directors of the Drug Abuse Council; and second,
six chapters on various drug policy topics prepared by the
council's staff and consultants. While not every judgment or
suggestion advanced in these staff report chapters is
specifically endorsed by the council's board of directors, they
do form the analytic base from which the board drew its
observations, conclusions, and recommendations. </p>

<hr>

<p> <b>The Report of the Directors</b> </p>

<p> As this report developed, it became increasingly clear that
the most valuable document we could provide would be one
addressed to the concerned citizen, not just to the professional
in the drug field. We stepped back from the day-to-day concerns
of those who work in research, treatment, prevention, and law
enforcement to begin to address the broader philosophical,
social, moral, legal, and pragmatic issues influencing national
drug policies and the expenditure of public funds. Thus readers
of this report will find few recommendations about the
particulars of program efforts in treatment, prevention, or
enforcement. We do not mean by this to suggest that there are no
improvements that can be made in program operations; there are in
fact many. We have, however, chosen to focus our discussion
instead on the public policies and attitudes from which these
program efforts stem. We believe that substantial benefits can
come only as a result of a significant rethinking of our approach
to drugs, not from tinkering with the mechanisms of our public
program response. </p>

<p> This report is a conscious effort to stimulate public
interest in drug policy issues and to promote greater public
understanding of them. By indicating the costs and benefits of
past and present efforts, we can begin to formulate and accept
principles with which more reasonable and effective alternative
approaches to drug misuse can be constructed. We have no
blueprint for a step-by-step solution to the nation's -problems
with drugs; in our opinion it would be a mistake for anyone to
think such a plan could be devised, given present knowledge. It
would, however, be equally erroneous to think that nothing can be
done to improve the current situation. </p>

<p> Since the creation of the Drug Abuse Council in 1972, what is
often termed &quot;the American drug scene&quot; has changed in
several ways. As a general observation, more Americans appear to
be using more psychoactive substances. Drug use and misuse have
become among the most compelling realities of contemporary
existence. Among legally available drugs, alcohol has increased
in the number of its users, particularly among younger people.
Among illicit drugs, marijuana has steadily increased in use, as
has cocaine more recently. Although recent research has provided
evidence of substantial numbers of occasional, nonaddicted heroin
users, federal officials report that heroin addiction has
declined over the past two to three years. </p>

<p> Greater changes can be observed in the nation's response to
drug use and misuse in terms of changes in laws and publicly
supported programs. In some respects, the situation has improved.
Given the magnitude of federal expenditures on drug treatment
programs and law enforcement efforts-estimated to be nearly $6
billion since 1971-some improvements should be demonstrable. For
example, the passage of the Drug Abuse Office and Treatment Act
of 1972 has led to the creation of a nationwide network of drug
treatment programs, chiefly for heroin dependence. As a result,
treatment for those dependent on heroin is now more readily
available. The federal National Institute on Drug Abuse reports
that between 1971 and 1978 hundreds of thousands of individuals
have received treatment in about two thousand federally funded
clinics throughout the country. However, many more have not
voluntarily sought treatment. </p>

<p> Another area of improvement over the past few years is in
basic research, work which has broadened understanding of the
addictive process and the biochemistry of the brain and central
nervous system. More questions remain unanswered than have been
answered, but recent progress is encouraging. </p>

<p> Perhaps the most significant change may be the decline in the
emotional fervor that once dominated public discussion of drugs.
Public concern is still intense; nonetheless, there is wider
public acknowledgment that simple, quick solutions to our drug
problems will not be forthcoming. As a result, public
expectations are more moderated development that may encourage
more realistic law enforcement and control objectives. </p>

<p> While we consider these to be changes for the better, the
basic situation remains: Despite progress in a number of areas,
more Americans use and misuse more psychoactive drugs than ever.
Since in our considered judgment this situation will prevail at
least through the next few years, it is necessary for us as a
nation to plan carefully and thoughtfully how to handle it most
responsibly. This planning requires a basic rethinking of
national goals, policies, and strategies regarding the use and
misuse of psychoactive drugs. The underlying social dynamics and
problems that lead to drug misuse are so exceedingly complex as
to as yet elude totally satisfactory solutions; the rational
course, then, is to begin with what has been learned from
history, particularly from the experience of the past several
years. </p>

<p> The council has several general observations that we regard
as of central importance to this process of rethinking, but
before submitting them, we emphasize again that we have no
step-by-step blueprint for solving the nation's drug problems. We
can, however, indicate where past experience and current analysis
should direct us, and we can begin to strive toward more
consistent, coherent, and responsible approaches to drug use and
misuse in the future. The following observations are, in our
view, central to this process. </p>

<p> 1. Psychoactive substances have been available for use since
the beginning of recorded time and will predictably remain so.
Man will undoubtedly continue to use such substances for a
variety of reasons: to relax, to escape, to enjoy, to worship, to
delude, to destroy. At given times in history certain drugs have
had greater appeal or easier availability and have consequently
been used more widely, but the essential point is that <i>some
psychoactive drugs are almost always readily available </i>to
enable people to achieve what they wish or need for alteration of
mood or mind. As we search for more effective policies and
programs, this certainty of drug availability should be at the
forefront of our thinking. </p>

<p> 2. <i>While the use of psychoactive drugs is pervasive,
misuse is </i>much <i>less frequent. </i>A failure to distinguish
between the misuse and the use of drugs creates the impression
that all use is misuse or &quot;drug abuse.&quot; This is
particularly true in the case of illicit drugs. For example,
while millions of Americans of high-school and college age have
experimented with various drugs and many use some of them
regularly, clearly the majority exercises personal restraint or
obeys social controls in drug-taking behavior. To state this in
another way, the number of young Americans who are in serious
personal difficulty because of the misuse of drugs is relatively
small. However, the frequent depiction of the minority who do
misuse drugs, especially illicit ones, as typical conveys the
mistaken impression that misuse is pervasive if not inevitable. </p>

<p> 3. While not enough is known about why certain individuals
misuse drugs, it is known that <i>there is a definite correlation
between pervasive societal ills-such as </i>poverty,
unemployment, and <i>racial </i>discrimination-and drug misuse.
When such conditions predominate-as they do in the inner-city
areas of many large American cities-the manifestations of
widespread drug misuse and trafficking in illicit drugs can be
seen in their most pernicious forms. So long as these adverse
social conditions persist, -widespread -drug misuse <b>care </b>be,
expected. Drug misuse resulting from such societal conditions
aggravates other urban problems, and makes restoring the vitality
of our inner cities more difficult to achieve. </p>

<p> 4. Attempts <i>to control </i>the availability <i>of drugs
often present a conflict between the desires of </i>individuals
and <i>the aspirations of society. </i>When harm to both the
individual and society is clearly demonstrable, the conflict may
be resolved. When harm to either is less clearly demonstrable, it
is less easily resolved. This may lead to dissension of
considerable magnitude, involving sensitive questions of
individual rights and the limits of governmental powers. To state
it plainly, the price of an effective strategy for eliminating
drug misuse would be perceived by many Americans as too high in
terms of the invasion of privacy and the abrogation of individual
freedoms. National drug policies must reflect careful balancing
of these concerns in order to enjoy substantial public support. </p>

<p> 5. Drug-related laws and policies center too often on the
drugs themselves and not often enough on the problems of the
people misusing them. This leads to <i>preoccupation with and
elaboration of the adverse aspects of certain drugs, </i>as if
they themselves were somehow culpable. Such thinking can
reinforce a focus on eliminating or legalizing the availability
of certain drugs as &quot;solutions&quot; to related problems.
Drug policies should instead be primarily focused on people and
their problems. </p>

<p> 6. Too many Americans have <i>unrealistic expectations about
what </i>drug <i>laws and programs can </i>accomplish. All too
often, these laws and programs are expected to eliminate drug
problems. More disturbing, drug laws and programs have been
expected to contribute substantially to other social objectives
as well, such as reducing crime, increasing employment, or
restoring family cohesion. Such expectations place overwhelming
and unfair burdens on laws, programs, and those administering
them, and make failure and public frustration commonplace. Our
drug policies and laws need to be more realistically stated to
command public support. </p>

<p> 7. Finally, we Americans should resist the temptation to
blame our drug problems on others. We have done this too often in
the past. Our <i>drug problems are peculiar to our own national
experience. </i>They derive from our history and cultural
traditions, our mistakes and prejudices, our societal ills and
flaws-not those of Turks, Mexicans, Burmese, or Colombians.
Certainly, many aspects <b>of </b>drug problems are international
in scope, and much can be gained by multinational research and
education efforts. At times we must seek the cooperation of other
peoples and other countries in order to try to curtail the flow
of illicit drugs into this country. However, the chances for
success in these cooperative efforts would be enhanced, in our
view, if they were undertaken with an acceptance that the most
fundamental aspect of American drug problems is the magnitude of
demand for drugs and that the problems leading people to mis<b>use
</b>drugs will not vanish even if the supply of one or two drugs
is eliminated. </p>

<p> It is against the backdrop of these general observations that
the council submits its conclusions and recommendations. We
repeat, they will not dispose of our drug problems. However, if
applied they would, in our view, mitigate much of the harm that
comes from present policies and approaches-harm that in the minds
of many is damaging in a free society. </p>

<p> As we observed above, Americans tend to overlook the capacity
for misuse of licit drugs and overestimate the misuse of illicit
drugs. As a consequence, we pursue widely divergent courses,
depending upon the legal status of a particular psychoactive
substance. </p>

<p> For example, some drugs, such as caffeine, are freely
available in a wide variety of forms. Use is frequently promoted
and misuse largely unacknowledged. Other drugs, such as nicotine
and alcohol, are considered potentially more harmful, but their
use is largely controlled by social attitudes and their misuse,
though discouraged, is not prohibited. Actions taken under the
influence of such drugs that have a potential for injury to
others-drunken driving, for instance-are subject to criminal
sanctions, although misuse itself is not. </p>

<p> Still other drugs, such as barbiturates, amphetamines, and
tranquilizers, have generally recognized legitimate medical uses,
yet they also have significant potential for harm if misused.
There is growing public awareness of this potential harm, and the
availability of these drugs is more carefully controlled, as, for
example, by prescription of licensed physicians. Criminal
sanctions are employed to discourage diversion from legitimate
channels. </p>

<p> Then there are some drugs, such as heroin and marijuana,
which are considered to be harmful to individuals and society and
without legitimate medical uses. National policy toward these
drugs over the past seven years has been a two-pronged effort to
control the supply or availability and reduce the demand. Thus,
laws are designed to eliminate the availability of these drugs by
prohibiting their use, production, or distribution, and criminal
sanctions are employed to enforce them. On the demand side,
assistance-primarily treatment for heroin addiction through
publicly funded clinics-is offered and sometimes mandated for
those using these drugs. </p>

<p> Public drug policies are in essence a reflection of
prevailing attitudes about psychoactive drugs, and current
attitudes are, conversely, strongly influenced by past and
present policy. In this manner current policies reflect
assumptions and events more than a half century old, despite the
fact that many of those assumptions were erroneous or founded in
demogoguery. Unfortunately, in the view of the council, drug
policies and prevailing public attitudes continue to represent
misunderstanding and wishful thinking more than sober analysis.
For example, it is still widely believed that by prohibiting the
use of a particular drug through the criminal law, that drug can
be eliminated from society. Despite sobering experiences to the
contrary, it is still hoped that more resources for law
enforcement and treatment or more stringent laws will end
problems with drugs. </p>

<p> Individuals use and misuse all kinds of licit and illicit
drugs for a wide variety of reasons, some with greater potential
for harm to themselves and society than others. For example, some
drug use is clearly experimental or inquisitive; individuals want
to know what a drug will do to them, how it will make them feel
and act. Other drug use is recreational; individuals use drugs to
relax, to enhance enjoyment of a social situation. Still other
drug use is demonstrably harmful and antisocial; individuals use
drugs in ways harmful to themselves or society. </p>

<p> As it is now constituted, however, national drug policy does
not reflect an adequate appreciation of these very real
differences in drug-using behavior-yet at the same time most
Americans in their day-to-day experience are at least generally
aware of such differences. For example, most are aware of the
difference between social drinking and alcoholism. They perceive
the difference between taking an occasional tranquilizer and
taking tranquilizers compulsively, between taking prescribed
narcotics to relieve pain and being addicted to them. Many
Americans have begun to recognize the difference between smoking
an occasional marijuana cigarette and being constantly
&quot;high&quot; on marijuana. To command in<i>formed public
support, public policies must recognize these differences in the
patterns and circumstances of drug use.</i> </p>

<p> Public policy regarding heroin can probably never be the same
as policy respecting marijuana or alcohol. These drugs differ
pharmacologically, and people generally use them for different
reasons and in different situations. However, the principles upon
which the control mechanisms of public drug policies are based
can and should be consistent. As the public begins to appreciate
the differences in drug use patterns and behavior, some changes
in attitudes and policy approaches are occurring. </p>

<p> For example, many states have lessened the severity of their
laws regarding marijuana possession. The use and misuse of
sedatives and tranquilizers are under scrutiny. Responsible
national organizations such as the National League of Cities and
the U.S. Conference of Mayors have publicly called for new
approaches to heroin addition. Others have urged caution in our
response to the observed increase in cocaine use, lest an
illadvised response make matters worse. </p>

<p> The federal government's attitude about drugs also has been
affected. The Ford administration's 1975 <i>White Paper on Drug
Abuse, </i>which expressed the federal strategy, differed
dramatically in tone from the &quot;war on drugs&quot; approach
of the early 1970s. Although the White <i>Pa</i>per had little
immediate impact, it opened the door for substantial future
changes. The Carter administration's appeal for the
&quot;decriminalization&quot; of marijuana has provided
additional evidence that change is possible. </p>

<p> Because the country does appear to be in a relatively calm
mood regarding drugs and a process of rethinking is evident, it
is a good time to look to the future. Given the council's belief
that in the future there will in all probability be more, not
less, use and misuse of psychoactive drugs, it is essential to
consider ways in which society may face this situation. </p>

<p> <b>Suggestions for the Future. </b>To state it plainly, the
challenge facing America regarding drugs is to determine how best
to live with the inevitable availability of psychoactive drugs
while mitigating the harmful aspects of their misuse. A case can
be made that we are, in fact, learning to do just that. </p>

<p> For example, the latest national survey indicates that
two-thirds of American adults regularly use alcohol and some 13
million adult and youthful drinkers are said to be problem
drinkers. Currently, federal efforts are increasingly focused on
determining the underlying causes of alcohol misuse in the hope
of developing more effective preventive and treatment measures.
However, despite very deep concerns, there are no serious
proposals for a return to Prohibition. The lessons of that
experience were well learned-the criminal justice system could
not and should not be society's chief agent for controlling
alcohol abuse. Instead, attention is now directed at more
effective public education and health measures. The public seems
to wish to reduce the dangers and risks associated with the
misuse of alcohol and yet continue to enjoy the perceived
benefits derived from responsible use. While no one argues that
we have been successful in eliminating the enormous social costs
of alcoholism and alcohol related problems, current policies are
largely regarded as both reasonable and responsible. </p>

<p> Similarly, a case can be made that, with nearly 50 million
Americans having tried marijuana and 16 million of these
reporting current use, the public (on the basis of opinion polls)
believes that marijuana use will not decrease markedly over the
next few years and that society must adapt to this use in a more
reasonable, responsible manner. While this usage, too, is seen by
many as a disturbing development, appreciable numbers think that
responsible adaptation is possible. To date, eleven state
legislatures have removed the threat of criminal arrest and
imprisonment for the possession or use of small amounts of
marijuana. This development reflects an understanding that severe
criminal sanctions against the use of small amounts of marijuana
are neither appropriate nor effective. The harm to society
associated with the use of small amounts of marijuana is not seen
as sufficient to justify the use of criminal sanctions in
attempts to control it. </p>

<p> Another case in point is the great increase in public
awareness during the past ten to fifteen years of the potential
harm of excessive cigarette smoking. Increased awareness has led
to new approaches in education and to ordinances and laws
imposing civil fines for smoking in designated &quot;no
smoking&quot; areas. Yet there have been no serious proposals to
jail those who smoke. Since smoking is perceived as at worst a
public health problem, not a criminal activity, more effective
public education and health measures are seen as the most
appropriate policy response. </p>

<p> These changes are encouraging. Perhaps they offer directions
for changes in public policy regarding the use of other
psychoactive drugs. In developing such new approaches to the use
and misuse of these drugs, the nation must first set realistic,
consistent goals. In <i>this regard, the </i>primary <i>goal the
council urges is that society seek to </i>minimize the <i>harm
and dysfunction that can accompany the misuse of any psychoactive
substance, whether that drug is currently classified as licit or
illicit,</i> </p>

<p> To accept this goal entails accepting factors which up to now
have not enjoyed wide acceptance-e.g., the continued use of
illicit drugs by many Americans. It also entails accepting that
not all illicit drug use is necessarily harmful. Further, it
indicates that seeking to minimize harm from drug misuse is not
synonymous with seeking to eliminate drug use. </p>

<p> If our goal is to minimize harm and dysfunction, then the
target of national efforts should logically be the harm and
dysfunction which come from indiscriminate drug use. <i>Such a
target calls primarily for education, public health, treatment,
and rehabilitation measures. </i>Such measures could be more
effective in reducing the misuse of drugs if other drug policies
themselves were more reasonable, consistent, and realistic. The
experience of decades makes it clear that only in reducing the
misuse of drugs is there real hope for effectively reducing drug
problems. This is not to say that society should sanction the
unbridled use of psychoactive drugs. To the contrary, public
policy should make clear society's strong disapproval of the
misuse of such drugs. This disapproval will be more persuasive if
it is expressed in terms of concern for individual health and
well-being. </p>

<p> This is also not to say that the nation should immediately
abandon all domestic and international law enforcement efforts
aimed at reducing the availability of illicit drugs. Though by no
means are all drug law enforcement and control efforts effective,
it would be highly inaccurate to say that they have produced no
benefits. While many of these benefits (e.g., reduction in the
availability of particular drugs) have proved temporary in the
past, even such temporary gains are welcome developments. To the
extent that law enforcement efforts curtail the supply of illicit
drugs in a responsible manner, they should be continued. </p>

<p> The problems with drug law enforcement are complicated.
Americans have historically overemphasized drug law enforcement
and control measures and, at least until recently,
underemphasized policies aimed at reducing the misuse of drugs.
In so doing we have paid enormous costs in both dollars and
other, less quantifiable ways, such as increased burdens on the
criminal justice system, corruption, and decreased respect for
law and those enforcing it. All too often these law enforcement
efforts have continued blindly and repetitiously without a
careful assessment and balancing of their costs and benefits. </p>

<p> Perhaps the greatest costs have been those attendant to
criminalizing users of illicit drugs. For example, to brand as
criminals hundreds of thousands of American youths otherwise
leading normal lives, by virtue of their experimental or
recreational marijuana use, presents a fundamental problem in a
society founded on principles of justice and respect for law. It
leads directly to suspicion of and disrespect for the law.
Similarly, to -persist <b>in </b>depicting addiction to opiate
drugs as leading inexorably to violent criminal behavior fosters
further disrespect for law. As is well documented, many opiate
addicts do engage in certain kinds of criminal behavior,
particularly &quot;crimes against property&quot; in order to
raise funds to support their drug habits; but addiction itself,
whether to narcotics, alcohol, or nicotine, is essentially a
psychological and physiological phenomenon. There are social,
cultural, and economic factors which demonstrably influence this
phenomenon or are intimately related to it, but addiction is a
&quot;crime&quot; only because we have traditionally labeled it
as such. </p>

<p> At this stage in our history, there is a clear need to
redress the longstanding imbalance between publicly funded
efforts to reduce misuse and efforts to reduce supply. The
primary focus of public policy should be on the former. We submit
that such a redressing would encourage more realistic
expectations-even public acceptance-of what law enforcement
strategies and agencies can accomplish in reducing drug
availability. </p>

<p> The most important aspect of such a change in emphasis would
be that public policy would reflect contemporary and foreseeable
realities in a straightforward manner. </p>

<p> By placing the major emphasis on reducing the misuse of
drugs, society will be confronted with the necessity of improving
program effectiveness in that regard; the record of the past is
not exemplary. There is an urgent need to expand the base of
knowledge concerning educational, preventive, and treatment
methodologies and techniques. This means a far greater investment
in basic and applied research and evaluation. In addition to
increasing the research investment, it will be necessary to
develop a national research strategy which can provide direction
and coordination to these efforts. Since it is unlikely that
answers will be instantly forthcoming, this strategy should be
applied for the next several years and assure continuity of the
research effort. Public officials must also be more willing to
change policies if necessary in response to expanded knowledge.
Only by taking these steps can there be a realistic expectation
of attracting the calibre of research scientists that could make
a difference. </p>

<p> While we think such an expanded research effort will produce
more understanding and better guidance for educational,
preventive, and treatment approaches, certain steps can be taken
now, based on available knowledge and experience, to make the
publicly funded response to drugs more reasonable and more
effective. </p>

<p> At the federal administrative level, for instance, there
should be much closer coordination between domestic and
international drug law enforcement efforts and agencies on the
one hand and prevention and treatment strategies and agencies on
the other. Effective coordination can occur only at the highest
levels of the executive branch of government, whether by a
special-purpose, cabinet-level committee or by a special staff in
the executive office, because the important drug program
functions are lodged in several departments and agencies
throughout the executive branch. </p>

<p> Such a high-level coordinating body or staff could meet two
essential criteria for greater effectiveness in national drug
policy development and implementation: First, it could develop a
cohesive policy, and, second, it could advise the President and
provide accountability to Congress, and thereby to the public. </p>

<p> This concept is, of course, not new. The 1972 Drug Abuse
Office and Treatment Act created the White House Special Action
Office on Drug Abuse Prevention which was succeeded in 1976 by
the Office for Drug Abuse Prevention. This latter office ceased
to function in 1978, to be succeeded-at least in some of its
functions-by a Special Assistant to the President for drug
issues, a small staff within the White House's Domestic Policy
Staff, and a Federal Strategy Council composed of public
officials and private citizens. However, while it thus appears
that a coordinating mechanism does now exist at the highest level
of the executive branch, it is our impression that this mechanism
is not currently achieving its major objectives, namely, the
development and implementation of a cohesive national drug policy
and closer coordination of law enforcement and treatment
agencies. </p>

<p> In addition to the more effective coordination mechanism that
we recommend, other improvements in the performances of drug
agencies are possible. This is as true for treatment and
prevention programs as it is for law enforcement agencies,
particularly as they relate to heroin addiction. Again, however,
we stress that for such improvements to make a lasting impact
they must be preceded by substantial changes in public policy. </p>

<p> In drug treatment activities at present, improvements are
both possible and needed. Some improvements can come by applying
the new knowledge gained in recent years; others can come by
seeking more aggressively to increase that knowledge. At the same
time there is a need to acknowledge the limitations of drug,
treatment, imposed by social and economic conditions well beyond
the influence of drug treatment programs. </p>

<p> One development that has begun to affect drug treatment
during recent years is change in the concept of heroin addiction.
There is convincing evidence that more individuals use heroin
than are addicted to it. Since most heroin treatment has been
founded on the principle that to use heroin is to be addicted to
it, the existence of large numbers of nonaddicted heroin users
has substantial implications. It is also known that the typical
heroin addict, once thought to use heroin to the exclusion of all
other drugs, is more likely to use many drugs, some in concert
with heroin, others when heroin is unavailable. One implication
of this is that when heroin is unavailable today's heroin addicts
are as likely to turn to other drugs as they are to treatment. </p>

<p> The past eight to ten years have seen substantial progress in
the treatment of heroin addiction. Various treatment approaches
have evolved, the most widely publicized of which has been the
use of the synthetic opiate methadone as a
&quot;maintenance&quot; drug for individuals addicted to heroin.
There are currently seventy-eight thousand individuals enrolled
in methadone maintenance programs throughout the country, the
majority of which are publicly funded. </p>

<p> During this same period there has been a corresponding
increase in the number of individuals enrolled in what are most
often termed &quot;drug free&quot; treatment programs, i.e.,
those based on the principle of abstinence from drug use and
using psychological and behavior modification techniques to
achieve this goal. There are currently an estimated 132,000
individuals receiving treatment in this type of program. </p>

<p> There now exists a nationwide network of treatment programs
and facilities none of which existed prior to 1972. This network
was initiated primarily by federal grants and contracts through
state drug abuse coordinating agencies to local governmental or
nonprofit programs. As a result, federal officials are frequently
quoted as saying that any heroin addict who wants treatment can
receive it. While this statement may be theoretically accurate,
there are two major caveats. First, the accomplishments of
treatment efforts are limited by lack of funding, societal
conditions (e.g., the general employment picture), and the
difficulties of providing &quot;successful&quot; treatment under
any circumstances. Second, for every heroin addict who is in
treatment on any given day, there are an estimated three who are
not. They have neither volunteered nor been referred by the
criminal justice system. </p>

<p> While there has been dramatic progress in making treatment
more available, serious problems remain. Perhaps the most
frustrating of these problems is the fact that no one-including
the council-appears able at this time to provide definitive,
persuasive answers about the comparative effectiveness of the
various treatment approaches. The basic problem with ascertaining
treatment effectiveness is that there is no public or
professional consensus about what treatment should accomplish or
what constitutes &quot;successful&quot; treatment. Different
approaches-e.g. abstinence, methadone maintenance, and
detoxification-are needed to respond to the broad diversity of
people in trouble from the misuse of drugs. Treatment success
should be gauged by the improved function of the individual in
society as measured by personal stability, employment, and
related criteria. Treatment for drug dependence need not have as
its primary goal abstinence from all drug use for its own sake.
To the extent that abstinence is attainable for certain
individuals, it should be a goal; for others, such a goal may be
unrealistic, premature, or even self-defeating. Treatment goals
should reflect the complex nature of drug dependence, which
varies from person to person. </p>

<p> Successful treatment for drug dependence may-foster-such a <i>degree
</i>of stability in an individual that he or she is able to be
gainfully employed; employment may in turn become a major
reinforcing factor in the success of treatment. It is, however,
unrealistic to expect too much regarding employment from
treatment and rehabilitation efforts since the individuals in
treatment often have little or no work experience and few skills
to offer in a job market characterized by fluctuating economic
conditions. Successful treatment may also result in such
stability that the individual no longer engages in criminal
activities to support a costly drug habit. In each case, the goal
of drug treatment should be the degree of stability necessary to
lead to later developments, not those developments themselves.
While some may brand such differences as only matters of
semantics, we believe they are of crucial importance to the
search for realistic goals in the treatment of drug dependence. </p>

<p> Further problems with treatment become evident when attention
is focused on the quality of different programs. There are not
enough programs which offer the wide range of assistance needed
by those dependent on drugs who seek rehabilitation. Numerous
factors have contributed to this situation, not the least of
which is the rapid proliferation of programs which occurred in
the early 1970s. Many weak programs were funded then and are
still in existence. The nature and quality of the clinical
process in many programs have also been adversely affected by the
increased number of treatment clients coming to them by referral
from the criminal justice system. This development has led some
drug treatment programs away from a properly therapeutic function
into an increasingly custodial role with their patients. </p>

<p> Health and drug treatment providers should not have to become
society's agents for the control of social deviance or criminal
activity. The primary responsibility of treatment systems should
be treatment. If modification of drug-taking behavior, even of
life styles, is a component of treatment then it should be
presented as such. Treatment for <i>drug dependence should be
available chiefly because people need help, not as a behavior or
crime control </i>measure. Conversely, efforts to curtail
drug-related crime should be presented as such and not mislabeled
as therapeutic approaches to drug dependency. </p>

<p> For now, pending the outcome of further study and evaluation
as well as research developments, there is a clear need to
integrate the treatment of heroin addiction more closely with the
general health care system. Drug treatment is now too isolated;
the cross-fertilization of new ideas and trends from other
disciplines which should be occurring is not observable. For drug
treatment to retain its vitality in the immediate future, it
cannot remain entirely apart from the mainstream of traditional
physical and mental health care, nor on the other hand can it be
totally absorbed by that system. </p>

<p> <i>Our final suggestion on treatment is that we should </i>immediately
en<i>ter into a more active phase of research and experimentation
with heroin, particularly regarding the potential of using the
drug itself in the treat</i>ment <i>of heroin addiction. </i>We
do not know enough about the treatment of heroin addiction or
about what types of treatment are effective to be able to close
our minds to alternative approaches. Through experience we have
learned much about the use of methadone in treatment; we need to
learn more about the potential of similar use of heroin. Several
highly qualified research scientists have designed a variety of
research protocols which call for the use of heroin at some stage
in the addiction treatment process. Under present law, these
projects could be funded; we are convinced that the most
promising of them should be. </p>

<p> This research should emphasize local and state options and
flexibility. What may prove efficacious in one setting may not in
others, and what may prove effective for one individual may be
inappropriate for another. While we have much to learn from the
experience of other countries, particularly England, heroin
addiction in America presents unique problems requiring creative
approaches. Thus, our call for research and experimentation into
the use of heroin in treatment should not be misconstrued as an
endorsement of the concept of heroin maintenance (i.e., the
provision of heroin to registered addicts). We have serious
reservations as to whether such an approach would prove
beneficial in this country. On the other hand, we submit that we
do need direct experience with the use of heroin in treatment
settings; otherwise, we will not be able to learn what we should
know before making decisions regarding fundamental policy
changes. </p>

<p> just as we think treatment program efforts and policies can
be improved, we feel that drug law enforcement can also be
improved. The basic problem with law enforcement efforts lies
with the drug laws themselves. As long as these laws separate
drugs into licit and illicit categories, there will be a
necessity for such agencies as the Drug Enforcement
Administration, with its primary mission of controlling the
availability of illicit drugs. The elimination of the
availability of these drugs is in our view unachievable; still,
as long as the laws remain in effect, they should be responsibly
enforced. </p>

<p> Earlier we indicated our belief that national drug policy
ought to be based on the way in which a drug is used rather than
on the properties of specific drugs. This enlightened approach is
generally characteristic of our public policies with respect to
alcohol, tranquilizers, and a host of other potentially abusable
drugs. Society accepts responsible use of these drugs, while
seeking to prevent their misuse and, if necessary, punishing both
those who jeopardize the safety of others by irresponsible usage
behavior and those who illegally manufacture or sell such drugs.
However, our laws regarding illicit drugs such as marijuana,
cocaine, and heroin do not distinguish responsible from
irresponsible use; thus, under the law, any use of these drugs
constitutes misuse or &quot;drug abuse.&quot; Drug law
enforcement is consequently directed, at least theoretically,
against all users and suppliers of illicit drugs. This is where
problems with drug law enforcement begin. It is not, however,
where they end. </p>

<p> Many proponents of a national policy of total prohibition of
illicit drug use are beginning to acknowledge the impossibility
of achieving such a goal. Revised goals, such as containment
rather than elimination of availability, are now being advanced.
Infrequently acknowledged, however, even with the more cautious
goals, are the attendant costs of attempted prohibition, such as
criminalizing and stigmatizing hundreds of thousands of users and
using questionable practices in developing cases against them. </p>

<p> Nor are we convinced of the supposed benefits of many current
drug law enforcement efforts. It is commonplace to assume that
laws and law enforcement efforts decrease the number of people
who would otherwise use these contraband substances. However,
there are reasons to doubt this assumption. Exhaustive study has
revealed little deterrent impact from the so-called &quot;get
tough&quot; drug laws of New York State. This study showed little
change in the incidence and prevalence of heroin or other illicit
drug use as a result of the new law. Similarly, in Oregon, where
annual surveys have been conducted to assess the impact of that
state's enactment of <font size="2">marijuana
&quot;decriminalization,&quot; no appreciable increase in use has
been observed over time or in comparison to other jurisdictions
where marijuana penalties have remained stringent. In fact, other
surveys indicate that the primary reason people have chosen
either not to begin use or to discontinue it is simple lack of
interest; -the existence of criminal sanctions against use ranks
quite low as a reason given for not using marijuana. While such
examples do not offer sufficient evidence from which to draw firm
conclusions, they do raise important questions requiring careful
examination.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The most important recommendation the Drug
Abuse Council can make in the area of drug law enforcement has
little to do with specific law enforcement approaches. <i>We
propose a major research effort to </i>analyze <i>the actual
effects of drug laws </i>and drug <i>law enforcement on personal
decisions to use or not use illicit drugs. </i>A well-designed
national study, similar to that of New York drug laws undertaken
in 1974 by the Bar Association of the City of New York, could
furnish much useful guidance in this sensitive area.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In addition to encouraging us to recommend
such general policy research, our years of examination of the
issues involved in the widespread use of marijuana in
contemporary society have convinced us, beyond a doubt, that the
use of criminal law and criminal procedures to deter marijuana
use results in more harm to society than is warranted by present
knowledge regarding its potential harm with moderate use. This
conviction should not be misconstrued as giving marijuana a clean
bill of health. Much about this drug remains unknown. Research
should continue, particularly multi-year studies which seek to
examine the consequences of marijuana use by humans over long
periods of time. Enough is now known to warrant considerable
caution with its use, particularly heavy use; use by pregnant
women and by adolescents should be avoided. <i>However, we also
believe that legislative efforts to decriminalize atfederal and
state levels the possession of small amounts of marijuana for
personal use should continue. States should be encouraged to try
different legislative models, the effects of which could be
assessed over time, </i>in an <i>effort to learn which works most
effectively to </i>minimize potential harm from <i>the
indiscriminate use of </i>marijuana.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The above observations and suggestions about
drug treatment and law enforcement lead us to the conclusion
that, by adhering to an unrealistic goal of total abstinence from
the use of illicit drugs, opportunities to encourage responsible
drug-using behavior are missed. Individual decisions about drug
use invoke value judgments seldom made in isolation; peer
pressure and social, economic, and cultural variables must all be
taken into consideration as we seek to minimize harm and prevent
misuse.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Public education efforts should attempt to
place the use and misuse of psychoactive drugs in accurate
perspective for all members of society, </font><font size="4">not
just younger members. In order to be helpful in minimizing the
harm of drug misuse, information must be credible, coherent, and
verifiable. It must be believable when placed in the context of
life experiences. For example, it strikes us as inconsistent to
issue calls for total abstinence from some drugs while
&quot;happy hours&quot; with two drinks for the price of one are
promoted for another. Such inconsistencies are readily apparent
to the youth of our country and engender skepticism on their part
as to the wisdom of official drug policies-and of the older
generation in general.</font> </p>

<p> Many of our suggestions and observations have been directed
toward policyrnakers in the public sector, those elected and
appointed public officials who make national drug policy through
their actions and decisions at federal, state, and local levels.
It is no less true today than it was seven years ago when the
Drug Abuse Council was created that the views of these officials
tend to be crisis-oriented and short-range. While public
officials have a duty to lead as well as to administer, there are
limitations to their ability to go much beyond prevailing public
attitudes in matters as volatile as drug issues. The private
sector, on the other hand, can and should play a critical,
responsible role in developing longer-range views and policies
and improved public attitudes. </p>

<p> The Drug Abuse Council has been one such effort in the
private sector. Other alternatives either already exist or could
be created. Any such entity will require the exertion of
private-sector leadership and the investment of resources
sufficient to undertake independent research and legislative,
budgetary, and policy analyses. Much basic examination and
reexamination has occurred and does not require repeating. With
modest annual expenditures, an organization within the private
sector could help keep the American public informed and provide
leadership for the development of broad public support for
sensible drug policies and programs. <i>It is our conviction that
the private sector needs to continue to take an active role in
both developing and assessing public drug policies and pro</i>grams.<br>
</p>

<p> A Final Thought and Suggestion. The goal of the council was
stated in its 1972 Annual Report. The chairman said, </p>

<p> The Directors of the Drug Abuse Council, widely
representative in personal and professional exposure and
involvement, are determined not to look to exhortations or crash
programs for illusory solutions or cures. Instead, because the
Council was initiated and is supported as a private independent
agency, unencumbered by shibboleths or taboos or political or
bureaucratic pressures, the Directors have been free-and have
exercised their freedom-to begin to learn, and to publish what
they have learned, about drug abuse and treatment in. a drug
using society. </p>

<p> Since 1972 the many publications of the council-and of
persons and agencies supported by the council-have reported what
we have learned about drugs, about their use, misuse, and our
response to them. In the concluding paragraphs of one of the last
and most significant studies initiated and supported by the
council, <i>The Nation's Toughest Drug </i>Law: Evaluating-the <i>New
York Experience ' </i>it is stated that, </p>

<p> First, the use of heroin and other opiates is but one element
of a larger problem. The misuse of all dangerous drugs-alcohol,
cocaine, opiates, and other mood-changing drugs, some prescribed
and some sold over the counter-all together constitutes &quot;the
drug problem.&quot; Problems with so many components do not yield
to one-dimensional solutions. As no single drug treatment method
is suitable for all users, so there is not likely to be a single
legal approach that is suitable for all offenders. </p>

<p> Second, whether or not illicit drug use is for the most part
a medical concern as some contend, it is incontrovertibly deeply
rooted in broader social &quot;maladies.&quot; Narcotics use in
particular is intimately associated with, and part of, a wider
complex of problems that includes family break-up, unemployment,
poor income and education, feeble institutional structures. and
loss of hope. </p>

<p> The final observation is a corollary of the second: it is
implausible that social problems as basic as these can be
effectively solved by the criminal law. </p>

<p> If this statement is accurate-and we are convinced that it
is-it reinforces our considered judgment that drug misuse is
primarily a social, medical, and public health problem, a problem
that will not yield to single or simplistic solutions or
approaches. And it reinforces our judgment that solutions or
approaches that might be useful in one place or with some
individuals would not necessarily be so in another setting or
with other people. </p>

<p> Recognizing that deeply felt attitudes and established
policies reflect fears and judgments that will yield slowly, if
ever, to facts and conditions described in the council's
publications, we recommend that serious consideration be given to
the use of individual state or local option as a means of
attempting solutions appropriate in one place but not in others.
Local option could encourage greater flexibility and ingenuity
rather than reliance upon an unrealistic, rigid homogeneity in
national drug policy. We need to respond to the diversity of
people who use and misuse drugs, base all our policies on a
consistent set of principles seeking to discourage misuse, and
keep our seemingly innate drug-using behavior within reasonable
limits through means which do not themselves cause more harm than
they prevent.<br>

<p><b>The LaGuardia Committee Report on Marijuana</b> </p>

<h1>Marihuana and School Children </h1>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the most serious accusations leveled against marihuana
by special feature writers has been that it is widely used by the
school children of this nation. These authors have claimed that
it has so detrimental an effect on development that it is a major
factor in juvenile delinquency. This phase of the marihuana
problem was deemed serious enough to merit primary consideration
in our study of the marihuana problem in New York City --
specifically in the Borough of Manhattan. We decided to attack
this aspect of the problem along the following lines: </p>

<ol>
    <li>To observe schools in order to see if pupils bought
        marihuana cigarettes from any peddlers operating in the
        neighborhood. </li>
    <li>To investigate thoroughly complaints made by parents to
        school and police authorities relative to marihuana and
        its use by school children. </li>
    <li>To interview principals, assistant principals, and
        teachers of many of the schools in New York City with
        reference to our project. </li>
    <li>To gather relevant statistics from various city bureaus
        and private agencies. </li>
</ol>

<p>Unknown to the school authorities, our investigators had under
surveillance many of the schools in the Borough of Manhattan.
They would observe a particular school for a number of
consecutive days, watch loiterers and suspicious characters in
the locality, and, under certain circumstances, follow some of
the children. This procedure was repeated at varying intervals in
different localities. From time to time the investigators would
return to some of the schools which they previously had kept
under surveillance. Attention was naturally concentrated upon
those schools from which emanated the most numerous complaints
and which were located in suspected neighborhoods. We must admit
that it would have been possible for such sales to have taken
place during the time that our investigators were not on duty,
but we came to the conclusion that there was no organized traffic
on the part of peddlers in selling marihuana cigarettes to the
children of the schools we observed. </p>

<p>Certain of the school authorities deserve special commendation
for their alertness in singling out suspicious characters
loitering in the vicinity of their schools. While investigating
one of the suspected schools, our investigators who were
loitering in the neighborhood were suspected and treated as
&quot;suspicious characters&quot; by the school authorities. </p>

<p>During the period of this survey the Police Department while
engaged in an entirely separate criminal investigation received a
lead indicating the sale of marihuana to children in a certain
high school. As a result, one pupil was arrested and convicted
for selling cigarettes to his classmates. </p>

<p>In the Harlem district we discovered a few places where school
children gathered during and after school hours for the purpose
of indulging in smoking ordinary cigarettes, drinking alcoholic
beverages, and engaging in homosexual and heterosexual
activities. </p>

<p>One of our investigators, having gained entrance to such a
place, ostentatiously displayed marihuana cigarettes which he had
with him. The madam of the place promptly cautioned him against
using the &quot;weed&quot; and insisted that at no time did she
permit any person to smoke it on her premises. </p>

<p>A surprising number of school children smoking ordinary
cigarettes were noted. A checkup revealed that these cigarettes
were being illicitly sold by men on the street and in candy
stores in the &quot;loose&quot; form. It is possible that this
trade in ordinary cigarettes is occasionally misinterpreted as
trade in &quot;reefers.&quot; </p>

<p>Interviews with school authorities were very significant, and
it is of value to summarize briefly some of the statements
actually made by them. The locations of the schools and the names
of the persons quoted are in our official files. </p>

<ol>
    <li>High School. Predominantly white. The principal stated,
        &quot;The school has never had any connection with
        marihuana, not even a rumor.&quot; </li>
    <li>High School. Predominantly white. The principal at first
        appeared to be evasive and did not readily volunteer
        information, but after repeatedly being pressed with the
        question stated that the school &quot;had not had any
        difficulty with the subject of marihuana.&quot; </li>
    <li>High School. Predominantly white. The principal
        emphatically stated, &quot;I have had no trouble with
        marihuana in my school.&quot; </li>
    <li>A vocational school in the Borough of Queens. Mixed.
        &quot;I have never heard the slightest thing about
        marihuana in connection with this school.&quot; </li>
    <li>High School. Queens. Mixed. &quot;We never had the
        slightest connection with marihuana in any way.&quot; </li>
    <li>Junior High School. Harlem. Predominantly Negro and
        Latin-American. The principal stated that there had been
        a few marihuana cases among the boys about eighteen
        months ago. His assistant volunteered the information
        that there had been some boys in the school who had
        &quot;reefers&quot; in their possession. On other
        occasions some of the boys appeared to be intoxicated and
        when examined confessed to having smoked
        &quot;reefers.&quot; He further stated, &quot;It was
        difficult to be sure if sleepy, perspiring,
        pallid-looking boys were feeling the effects of marihuana
        or were just recovering from too much 'partying' or
        drinking.&quot; He volunteered the opinion that since
        marihuana was an acute problem among the adult population
        in that particular district, it could be assumed that
        marihuana could occasionally become a problem in the
        school. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White and Latin-American. On the
        fringe of Harlem. Principal and assistant principal
        stated that they have never had the slightest difficulty
        arising from marihuana. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White and Negro. Bordering on Harlem.
        The principal, because of his short tenure of office, was
        unable to express his opinion on the subject. The chief
        clerk stated that marihuana had never been a problem in
        the school. She was certain, however, that it was sold in
        the neighborhood. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White, with a high percentage of
        Negro and Latin-American. The principal stated, &quot;As
        yet we have had no contact with marihuana although,
        considering the neighborhood, it would not be
        unlikely.&quot; </li>
    <li>Junior High School. Latin-American, Negro, and some
        white. The principal stated, &quot;We have had no trouble
        with marihuana.&quot; He was of the opinion that because
        of the locality it would be possible for some older boys
        to smoke it without anybody being cognizant of it. He
        added that he would let us know if any boys were detected
        smoking. During the period of the survey no such report
        was made. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. Latin-American predominating. The
        principal stated that she had not had any trouble with
        marihuana. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White predominating. The principal
        stated, &quot;I have had no contact with it.&quot;
        However, due to the location of the school, which was
        near Harlem, she stated she would notify the Juvenile Aid
        Bureau if such a problem arose. During the period of the
        survey no such report was received. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The principal stated that no
        information concerning the use of any narcotics had ever
        come to his attention and was equally insistent that
        teachers would have reported any such information to him.
    </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The principal stated that she
        had never found anything to indicate the use of any drug
        in the school. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White and mixed. The principal stated
        that last year he had suspected that a group of chronic
        truants were using marihuana but he was unable to obtain
        any direct evidence. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The principal and his
        assistant stated that they had no real evidence of any
        marihuana problem in the school, and they do not believe
        that the drug is used to any extent. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The principal stated that
        although she had no tangible evidence of marihuana
        smoking among the students, she has problem groups that
        gather in premises where she is inclined to think that
        marihuana could be obtained if they wished to get it. She
        is certain no marihuana is used in the school itself. We
        investigated thoroughly the suggestions made by the
        principal as to premises where marihuana might be sold
        but we were unable to gather any evidence of its sale. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The acting principal and a
        teacher in the school who had been there for a number of
        years stated that there had never been any evidence of
        the use of marihuana or any other drugs in the school. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The health director of this
        school stated that any evidence concerning the use of
        narcotics by pupils would have been called to his
        attention, but none had been. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The authorities stated that
        there had been no traces of marihuana smoking. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The authorities stated that
        there had never been the slightest suggestion of
        marihuana smoking in the school. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The assistant principal stated
        that he knew of no marihuana problem in the school. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The principal stated that
        because of the publicity given to marihuana smoking she
        had been on the alert to discover indications of its use
        in her school but had found no evidence of marihuana in
        the school or of anything that would lead her to believe
        that any one of her students used marihuana outside of
        the school. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The principal stated that
        nothing pertaining to the use of narcotics had been
        reported to him in all the years he had been there. </li>
    <li>High School. Predominantly white. Authorities, including
        the medical department, stated that no student had ever
        been reported for being under the influence of marihuana.
    </li>
    <li>High School. Predominantly white. The principal stated,
        &quot;There is no indication of a marihuana problem in
        the school.&quot; </li>
    <li>Grammar School. The principal stated that anonymous
        letters had been received from time to time from pupils
        in the school in reference to marihuana. One letter was
        actually signed by a pupil of the school, who reported
        the sale of marihuana in a candy store in the vicinity.
        The principal with held the name of the pupil but
        requested us to investigate the report. We kept this
        school, the immediate neighborhood, and all candy stores
        in the vicinity under strict surveillance, but were
        unable to gather any evidence which would indicate that
        the pupils of this school were obtaining marihuana. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. Negro. Queens. The assistant
        principal stated that he had never heard anything about
        marihuana being a problem in his school. We had received
        a complaint about this school and one of our
        investigators had an informal chat with one of the
        teachers of this school who, because of her interest in
        the school children, appeared to be more conversant than
        anyone else with general problems at the school. She
        stated that she was certain marihuana was used by some of
        the students. She elaborated on the subject and recalled
        that a few months prior to the interview she had sent
        home five students (three Negroes and two Italians) whom
        she had noticed acting &quot;dopey&quot; in the classroom
        after the noon recess. She was not positive they were
        under the influence of marihuana but was fairly certain
        that they were under the influence of some drug. A
        student had told her that these boys used
        &quot;reefers&quot; and, noticing their stupor, she had
        concluded that they were under the influence of
        marihuana. Superficial examination showed her that their
        condition was not due to drinking whisky or any alcoholic
        beverage. In this school it was not necessary to notify
        the principal if a student was sent home. The teacher did
        so on her own account, arriving at a diagnosis without
        informing the principal of the condition. There was no
        doctor or nurse to examine the students. </li>
    <li>Grammar School. Negro. The principal and the social
        worker attached to this school stated that some time
        prior to the interview they had heard that cigarettes
        were being sold to children in Harlem. We were told of a
        certain man who was suspected of selling them to the
        children. The social worker was certain that a year
        before the interview marihuana cigarettes were sold on a
        certain street in Harlem to school children, but she had
        no knowledge as to whether the condition existed at the
        time of our investigation. While working on another part
        of the survey, we interviewed a young Negress,
        approximately 20 years of age, who was a marihuana
        smoker. She stated that she and another girl started to
        smoke marihuana cigarettes while attending this
        particular school. </li>
    <li>High School. Mixed, predominantly white. The principal
        stated that he was positive that there was no marihuana
        problem in his school. </li>
    <li>High School. Predominantly white. A student was arrested
        for selling marihuana cigarettes to other pupils. We kept
        this school under surveillance after the arrest. Although
        we heard rumors that the sale of marihuana would start
        again, we were unable to gather any evidence of this. Our
        investigators attended the dance of the graduating class
        of this school at one of the hotels in the city. The
        dance was well conducted and had a large attendance.
        There was no evidence of smoking at this affair. The
        principal was cooperating with the Juvenile Aid Bureau of
        the Police Department in conducting the investigation of
        the marihuana problem in his school. </li>
    <li>High School. White and Negro. Although rumor is
        widespread that &quot;reefer&quot; smoking is common at
        this school, thorough investigation did not produce
        evidence of it at the time of our investigation. We did
        obtain information, which we consider authoritative, that
        in 1935 a man was offered the concession to sell
        marihuana cigarettes to the students of this school. He
        refused the offer. The principal of this school stated
        that there had never been any trouble as a result of
        marihuana smoking and he knew of no actual cases. </li>
    <li>High School. White, Negro, and Latin-American. The
        director of health education, who was conversant with the
        subject, stated that the school had no problem with
        regard to marihuana smoking on the premises but that a
        Puerto Rican student who lived in Harlem had informed him
        that he could obtain marihuana cigarettes in his
        locality. </li>
    <li>College. White, some Negroes and Latin-Americans. We did
        not interview the authorities. Observation of the be
        havior of and conversation with students did not reveal
        any marihuana problem. </li>
    <li>College. White, some Negroes and Latin-Americans. This
        college is located near one of the famous
        &quot;tea-pads&quot; of Harlem. Many of the students pass
        the house regularly. Continued observation did not reveal
        any student attendance. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. Negro. Most of the boys of this
        school were familiar with the subject of marihuana. The
        pupils of the school are incessant smokers of ordinary
        cigarettes. We were unable to obtain any information
        which would indicate that they used &quot;reefers.&quot;
        Some students were observed entering a house in which
        there was a &quot;tea-pad,&quot; but we never found any
        of the occupants of this &quot;tea-pad&quot; to be pupils
        of the school. The counselor at the school stated that
        during the previous term there were suspicions regarding
        the use of marihuana. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. Negro. The principal, who is
        considered qualified to discuss this subject, stated that
        for the three months prior to the interview there had
        been no marihuana problem. She ventured the opinion that
        a few cases do arise in the spring and summer.
        Observation of this school reveals that practically every
        day young boys between the ages of 18 and 20 loitered
        near the gates of the schoolyard at the close of the
        session. Some of these boys were known to our
        investigators as &quot;reefer&quot; smokers, and they
        associated with the girls of the school. Two young girls
        known by our investigators to be &quot;reefer&quot;
        smokers stated that they started to smoke marihuana while
        at that school. </li>
    <li>High School. White, many Negroes and Latin-Americans.
        Many students smoked ordinary tobacco cigarettes.
        Numerous complaints and rumors were associated with this
        school. The principal stated that in 1934 they had an
        acute marihuana problem but that at the present time they
        did not think it existed. They are constantly on guard,
        especially at the beginning of a term, because they get
        many new students from the Harlem district. We are of the
        opinion that there are definite signs indicating that
        there is some marihuana smoking in the school. </li>
    <li>High School. Negro and white. The principal of this
        school stated that they did not have a marihuana problem.
        We are certain, however, that this school does to some
        extent present an acute problem for we have observed a
        few students smoking &quot;reefers&quot; away from the
        school. We have reason to believe that some of them smoke
        it while at school. The girls attending this high school
        have a very low moral standard. </li>
</ol>

<p>On the basis of the above statements and findings, we feel
justified in concluding that although marihuana smoking may be
indulged in by small numbers of students in certain schools of
New York City, it is apparently not a widespread or largescale
practice. In the belief that actual facts concerning the role
played by marihuana in the production of juvenile delinquency
could best be revealed in the records of the Children's Court of
New York City, we interviewed the proper authorities on this
subject. On the basis of the Children's Court records for 1939,
marihuana is not an important factor in the development of
delinquency. </p>

<p><b>The LaGuardia Committee Report on Marihuana</b> </p>

<h1>The Mental Attitude of the Marihuana Smoker Toward Society
and Marihuana</h1>

<hr>

<p>Most of the smokers of marihuana coming within the scope of
our survey were unemployed, and of the others most had part-time
employment. </p>

<p>Occasional, as well as confirmed, users were all aware of the
laws pertaining to the illegal use of the drug. They did not
indulge in its use with a spirit of braggadocio or as a challenge
to law as has been reported by some investigators in other
districts. They did not express remorse concerning their use of
marihuana, nor did they blame this habit as a causative factor in
the production of special difficulties in their personal lives.
Except for musicians there appeared to be no attempt at
secretiveness on the part of the habitual smoker. This attitude
is in marked contrast to that usually taken by those addicted to
morphine, cocaine, or heroin. </p>

<p>The consensus of marihuana users is that the drug is not
harmful and that infrequent or constant use of marihuana does not
result in physical or mental deterioration. </p>

<p>In describing the most common reaction to the drug they always
stated that it made them feel &quot;high.&quot; Elaboration of
just what the smoker meant by &quot;high&quot; varied with the
individual. However, there was common agreement that a feeling of
adequacy and efficiency was induced by the use of marihuana and
that current mental conflicts were allayed. Organic illness was
not given as a cause for smoking &quot;reefers.&quot; </p>

<p>A person may be a confirmed smoker for a prolonged period, and
give up the drug voluntarily without experiencing any craving for
it or exhibiting withdrawal symptoms. He may, at some time later
on, go back to its use. Others may remain infrequent users of the
cigarette, taking one or two a week, or only when the
&quot;social setting&quot; calls for participation. From time to
time we had one of our investigators associate with a marihuana
user. The investigator would bring up the subject of smoking.
This would invariably lead to the suggestion that they obtain
some marihuana cigarettes. They would seek a &quot;tea-pad,&quot;
and if it was closed the smoker and our investigator would calmly
resume their previous activity, such as the discussion of life in
general or the playing of pool. There were apparently no signs
indicative of frustration in the smoker at not being able to
gratify the desire for the drug. We consider this point highly
significant since it is so contrary to the experience of users of
other narcotics. A similar situation occurring in one addicted to
the use of morphine, cocaine, or heroin would result in a
compulsive attitude on the part of the addict to obtain the drug.
If unable to secure it, there would be obvious physical and
mental manifestations of frustration. This may be considered
presumptive evidence that there is no true addiction in the
medical sense associated with the use of marihuana. </p>

<p>The confirmed marihuana smoker consumes perhaps from six to
ten cigarettes per day. He appears to be quite conscious of the
quantity he requires to reach the effect called &quot;high.&quot;
Once the desired effect is obtained he cannot be persuaded to
consume more. </p>

<p>He knows when he has had enough. The smoker determines for
himself the point of being &quot;high,&quot; and is ever
conscious of preventing himself from becoming &quot;too
high.&quot; This fear of being &quot;too high&quot; must be
associated with some form of anxiety which causes the smoker,
should he accidentally reach that point, immediately to institute
measures so that he can &quot;come down.&quot; It has been found
that the use of such beverages as beer, or a sweet soda pop, is
an effective measure. Smokers insist that &quot;it does something
to the stomach&quot; and that it is always associated with
&quot;belching.&quot; A cold shower will also have the effect of
bringing the person &quot;down.&quot; </p>

<p>Smokers have repeatedly stated that the consumption of whisky
while smoking negates the potency of the drug. They find it is
very difficult to get &quot;high&quot; while drinking whisky, and
because of that smokers will not drink whisky while using the
&quot;weed.&quot; They do, however, consume large quantities of
sweet wines. It is their contention that this mild alcoholic
beverage aids the drug in producing the desired effect. Most
marihuana smokers insist that the appetite is increased as the
result of smoking. </p>

<p>We have been unable to confirm the opinion expressed by some
investigators that marihuana smoking is the first step in the use
of such drugs as cocaine, morphine, and heroin. The instances are
extremely rare where the habit of marihuana smoking is associated
with addiction to these other narcotics.<br>
</p>

<h2>Marihuana and Eroticism </h2>

<p>In the popular agitation against the use of marihuana, its
erotic effects have been stressed repeatedly. As previously
stated in this report, our investigators visited many
&quot;tea-pads&quot; in the Borough of Manhattan. It is true that
lewd pictures decorated the walls but they did not find that they
were attracting attention or comment among the clientele. In fact
one of the investigators who was concentrating his attention on
the relation between marihuana and eroticism stated in his report
that he found himself embarrassed in that he was the only one who
examined the pictures on the wall. </p>

<p>Numerous conversations with smokers of marihuana revealed only
occasional instances in which there was any relation between the
drug and eroticism. At one time one of our investigators attended
a very intimate social gathering in an apartment in Harlem,
having succeeded in securing the position of doorman for the
occasion. </p>

<p>There was a great deal of drinking, and the dancing was of the
most modern, abandoned, &quot;jitter-bug&quot; type. This form of
dancing is highly suggestive and appears to be associated with
erotic activity. The investigator made careful observation of
those who were dancing, and found that there was no difference
between the ones who were and the ones who were not smoking
&quot;reefers.&quot; Similar impressions were received after
careful observations in public dance halls, places where they
knew that some persons were under the influence of marihuana. </p>

<p>Visits to brothels which occasionally also served as
&quot;teapads&quot; revealed that the use of marihuana was not
linked to sexuality. These observations allow us to come to the
conclusion that in the main marihuana was not used for direct
sexual stimulation. <br>
</p>

<h2>Crime </h2>

<p>One of the most important causes of the widespread publicity
which marihuana smoking has received is the belief that this
practice is directly responsible for the commission of crimes. </p>

<p>During our investigation many law enforcement officers,
representing various federal, state and local police bureaus,
were interviewed and asked for a confidential expression of
opinion on the general question of crime and marihuana. In most
instances they unhesitatingly stated that there is no proof that
major crimes are associated with the practice of smoking
marihuana. They did state that many marihuana smokers are guilty
of petty crimes, but that the criminal career usually existed
prior to the time the individual smoked his first marihuana
cigarette. These officers further stated that a criminal
generally termed as a &quot;real&quot; or
&quot;professional&quot; criminal will not associate with
marihuana smokers. He considers such a person inferior and
unreliable and will not allow him to participate in the
commission of a major crime. </p>

<p>In the period beginning October 1939 and ending November 1940,
the Police Department made 167 arrests for the possession and use
of marihuana. Classified according to race they were: white, 33
men, 4 women; Latin-American, 26 men, 2 women; Negro, 83 men, 6
women; Latin-American (colored) 9 men, 1 woman- British East
Indies 1, Filipino 1, Chinese 1. Classified according to age, 12
per cent were between the ages of 16 and 20, 58 per cent between
the ages of 21 and 30, 24 per cent between the ages of 31 and 40,
and 6 per cent between the ages of 41 and 50. </p>

<p>During the period under discussion, the Police Department
confiscated approximately 3,000 pounds of marihuana. </p>

<p>The sale and use of marihuana is a problem engaging the
vigilance of the New York Police Department. However, the number
of officers available for such duty is limited. Officers
specifically assigned to the Narcotics Division of the Police
Department are acquainted with the problem, but the majority of
the officers are fundamentally without authoritative knowledge
regarding this subject. </p>

<p>The relation between marihuana smoking and the commission of
crimes of violence in the city of New York is described by Dr.
Walter Bromberg, psychiatrist-in-charge of the Psychiatric Clinic
of the Court of General Sessions, in an article published in the
Journal of the American Medical Association:<br>
</p>

<p>(start quotation) </p>

<p>In the south of this country (New Orleans) the incidence of
marihuana addicts among major criminals is admittedly high.
Sporadic reports from elsewhere in the country of murders and
assaults due to marihuana appear in the press frequently. It is
difficult to evaluate these statements, because of their
uncritical nature. The bulletin prepared by the Foreign Policy
Association lists ten cases &quot;culled at random from the files
of the U.S. Bureau of Narcotics&quot; of murder and atrocious
assault in which marihuana was directly responsible for the
crime. </p>

<p>Among the ten patients, the second, J. O., was described as
having confessed how he murdered a friend and put his body in a
trunk while under the influence of marihuana. </p>

<p>J. O. was examined in this clinic; although he was a
psychopathic liar and possibly homosexual, there was no
indication in the examination or history of the use of any drug.
The investigation by the probation department failed to indicate
use of the drug marihuana. The deceased, however, was addicted to
heroin. </p>

<p>Our observations with respect to marihuana and crime were made
in the Court of General Sessions over a period of five and a half
years. The material in that court is limited as to residence to
New York County, although it must be remembered that the
offenders come from many sections of the country and are of many
racial types. This is important, because the British
investigators have noted in India that cannabis does not bring
out the motor excitement or hysterical symptoms in Anglo-Saxon
users that occur in natives. There are several other difficulties
in collecting reliable material, one being the complete
dependence on the history and statements of the prisoners without
an opportunity for objective tests or other corroborative check,
as in the case of other drugs, e.g., heroin or morphine. </p>

<p>During routine interviews of some 17,000 offenders in six and
a half years, several hundred have been found who had direct
experience with marihuana. Their testimony checks with
experimental results and clinical experiences with regard to the
symptoms of intoxication, the absence of true addiction, and the
negative connection with major crime. Especially is this
noteworthy among sexual offenders and in cases of assault or
murder. The extravagant claims of defense attorneys and the press
that crime is caused by addiction to marihuana demands careful
scrutiny, at least in this jurisdiction.... </p>

<p>Most of the narcotic cases in New York County are heard in the
Court of Special Sessions, where misdemeanants are handled and
where indictments on charges of the possession of drugs for use
are returned. In the Court of Special Sessions in the same
six-year period, of approximately 75,000 indictments for all
crimes, 6,000 resulted in convictions for the possession and use
of drugs. </p>

<p>Since neither the law, the district attorney nor the police
department makes any distinction between the several kinds of
narcotics in arraignments or indictments, there were no figures
from which to estimate the number of users of marihuana as
distinguished from the number of users of other drugs. A system
of sampling the 6,000 cases was therefore adopted in order to
furnish an approximate estimate of the total number of marihuana
users who came into conflict with the law. </p>

<p>In this sampling the records of 1,500 offenders, or 25 per
cent of the 6,000, were examined. Of these, 135 were charged in
connection with marihuana. From this fact it was estimated that
about 540 offenders, or 9 per cent of all drug offenders coming
to the Court of Special Sessions in six years, were users of
marihuana. In analyzing this sample of 135 cases, it was found
that 93 offenders had no previous record, the previous charges or
charges of 8 concerned only drugs, 5 had records including drug
charges and 29 had records not including drug charges. Among
those with longer records, that is, from four to seven previous
arrests, none showed progression from the use of drugs to other
crimes. </p>

<p>As measured by the succession of arrests and convictions in
the Court of General Sessions (the only method of estimation) it
can be said that drugs generally do not initiate criminal
careers. Similarly, in the Court of Special Sessions, only 8 per
cent of the offenders had previous charges of using drugs and 3.7
per cent had previous charges of drugs and other petty crimes. In
the vast majority of cases in this group of 135, then, the
earlier use of marihuana apparently did not predispose to crime,
even that of using other drugs. Whether the first offenders
charged with the use of marihuana go on to major crime is a
matter of speculation. The expectancy of major crimes following
the use of cannabis in New York County is small, according to
these experiences.(4) </p>

<h1>The Facts About Drug Abuse </h1>

<p> <b>The Drug Abuse Council, 1980</b> </p>

<p> <font size="5">Foreword</font> </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"> </p>

<p> IN 1970, at the peak of the drug scare, the trustees of the
Ford Foundation decided that piecemeal measures were not enough.
As a first step in a major program the Foundation asked Patricia
M. Wald, now a United States Circuit judge in the District of
Columbia, and Peter B. Hutt, a Washington lawyer, to undertake a
survey in depth of drug abuse and to suggest what private
foundations might contribute to understanding, if not solution,
of the problem. In their report to the Foundation published in
1972 -Dealing with Drug Abuse-judge Wald and Mr. Hutt said: </p>

<p> It is of fundamental importance that man has and will
inevitably continue to have potentially dangerous drugs at his
disposal, which he may either use properly or abuse, and that
neither the availability of these drugs nor the temptation to
abuse them can be eliminated. Therefore, the fundamental
objective of a modern drug-abuse program must be to help the
public learn to understand these drugs and how to cope with their
use in the context of everyday life. An approach emphasizing
suppression of all drugs or repression of all drug users will
only contribute to national problems. </p>

<p> There is an urgent need for effective nongovernmental
leadership toward a more reasoned approach to drug abuse in this
country. A void exists that we believe can be filled by the
creation of a new Drug Abuse Council. In our best judgment, the
Council could successfully exert this leadership and could have a
substantial and beneficial impact on drug abuse in this country.<br>
</p>

<p> According to McGeorge Bundy, then President of the Ford
Foundation, <br>
</p>

<p> The second important step was to join with three other
foundations that have shared our concern with drug abuse-the
Carnegie Corporation, the Commonwealth Fund, and the Henry J.
Kaiser Family Foundation-in financing one of the principal
recommendations of the report, namely, the establishment of an
independent national Drug Abuse Council.<br>
</p>

<p> (The Equitable Life Assurance Society joined the foundations
in contributing to the expenses of the Council.) </p>

<p> The Council was organized in January 1972, but only after it
had been determined that a widely representative board of
directors and a highly competent staff could be assembled for
about five years of active service. The last formal meeting of
the board was held in June 1978, and since then the President of
the Council, Dr. Thomas E. Bryant, and the staff have been
engaged in the preparation of this Final Report. </p>

<p> The Report demonstrates that widespread misuse or abuse of
dangerous drugs-not just heroin, marijuana, and cocaine, but
alcohol and caffeine, and a great variety of stimulants and
tranquilizers, some prescribed, some sold over the counter-is not
an evil that can be extirpated by legislation or other means. Yet
it is believed that an informed society, aware of the
complexities of the issues and evidence, will be better able to
cope constructively with the use of drugs. This belief underlies
this Final Report. </p>

<p> It is not the function of a foreword to anticipate the
findings and conclusions of a massive study. It would, however,
be gross neglect not to acknowledge in this foreword the
exceptional contributions of the directors, the officers and
staff and consultants of the Council, and the foundations and
many others who have enabled the Council to apply knowledge and
reason to the understanding and treatment of a major national
problem. These include: </p>

<p> Judge Wald and Mr. Hutt, the Co-chairmen, and James V.
DeLong, the extraordinarily able Executive Director of the Ford
Foundation survey staff, who produced <i>Dealing with Drug </i>Abuse-the
seminal study that led to the creation of the Council. </p>

<p> The directors of the Council for regular attendance at
meetings, for the information and wisdom and wit that enriched
the deliberations of the board, and especially Dr. Bryant for the
personal and professional qualities that underpinned his
indispensable leadership. </p>

<p> And, of course, the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie
Corporation, the Commonwealth Fund, the Henry J. Kaiser Family
Foundation, and the Equitable Life Assurance Society, for the
financial support essential to a major private enterprise. </p>

<p> And the Council here records special gratitude to the senior
officers and responsible staff of the Ford Foundation for six
years of unfailing interest and support.<br>

<h1>Subjects Selected for the Study</h1>

<hr>

<p>For the purpose of establishing a uniform plan of procedure to
be followed throughout the study, a test group of 5 individuals
who had had no previous experience with marihuana was selected.
These were volunteers who were paid for their services. They were
of a low socio-economic level, but classified as of better than
average intelligence. Only one of the group came within the range
of what is considered normal personality. They represented the
type of person who would readily take to marihuana were the
opportunity offered. </p>

<p>The main group, 72 subjects, was drawn from the inmates of the
penitentiaries at Riker's and Hart Islands and the House of
Detention for Women, all of which are under the supervision of
the Department of Correction of New York City. There were two
advantages in selecting subjects from this particular group;
first, they could be kept under continuous observation throughout
the period desired, and second, they constituted an excellent
sample of the class in New York City from which the marihuana
user comes. The subjects all volunteered for the study after
having its purpose and the part they were to take in it fully
explained to them. </p>

<h3>Race, Sex and Age.</h3>

<p>Of the group, 65 were males and 7 were females; 35 were white,
26 were Negroes, and 11 were Puerto Ricans. The ages ranged from
21 to 37 years except for one who was 45 and another who was 43.
Of the women, 6 had been opium addicts for a number of years. </p>

<h3>Previous Experience with Marihuana.</h3>

<p>Forty-eight of the group, including 6 of the women, gave a
history of marihuana smoking. The extent of the usage was
variable- for some it was occasional, while others had indulged
in the habit fairly steadily over a period of years. Of the 48
users, those who were sellers of marihuana were probably the most
consistent smokers, as in carrying on the traffic they would
endeavor to keep a stock on hand. But in any instance, the number
of cigarettes smoked during any stated period would vary
according to circumstance. Thus one user stated that he smoked
from 2 to 6 marihuana cigarettes a day, another from 10 to 15 a
day, another 3 or 4 a week, and another 5 or 6 a month. Those who
smoked daily are here classified as steady users, those who
smoked when opportunity was offered but not daily, as occasional
users.<br>
</p>

<p>(TABLE 1)<br>
</p>

<p>The users had all been deprived of marihuana from the time of
their arrest, the shortest period being two weeks, the longest,
one year and ten months. They all stated that the habit had often
been interrupted voluntarily and the enforced discontinuation of
it had caused no discomfort. </p>

<h3>Health Record.</h3>

<p>The subjects were individually selected by Dr. Allentuck as
suitable for the study. A physical and neurological examination
at the hospital showed no evidence of disease. However, the
Wassermann and Kline tests gave positive results for 6 subjects
and the Kline test alone was positive for 2 and doubtful for 2.
These figures are consistent with those of the population from
which the group was selected. Of the 12,000 inmates of the
Riker's Island Penitentiary in 1940 and the 8,000 in 1941, 10 per
cent reacted positively to serological tests. </p>

<h3>Intelligence Record.</h3>

<p>Sixty subjects (40 users and 20 nonusers ) to whom the
Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test was given had an average I.Q. of
99.3, range 70 to 124. The average I.Q. of the user group was
96.7, range 70 to 124, while that for the non-user group was
104.5, range 93 to 114. </p>

<p>When analyzed according to racial distribution, the two groups
were even better equated intellectually than the total results
indicate. Of the 28 white subjects examined, the average I.Q. of
the 13 users was 106.1, range 77 to 124, and that of the 15
non-users was 106.3, range 96 to 114. The 19 Negro users had an
average I.Q. of 92.6, range 70 to 112, and the 5 Negro non-users
averaged 98.8, range 93 to 101. Although in the colored group the
non-users averaged 6.2 points higher than the users, it must be
taken into account that the number of Negro non-users tested was
small. The average I.Q. of the 8 Puerto Rican users was 91.0,
range 72 to 100; that is, they were very similar in mental
ability to the Negro users. From the results obtained from the
Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test, one may conclude that neither
the users nor the nonusers were inferior in intelligence to the
general population.<br>
</p>

<h3>Marihuana Used<br>
</h3>

<p>The marihuana that was used for oral administration was
supplied by Dr. H. J. Wollner, Consulting Chemist of the United
States Treasury Department. It was in the form of an alcohol
fluid concentrate, the alcohol content ranging from 55 to 67.3
per cent and the content of solids from 22.9 to 33.6 Sm. per 100
cc. </p>

<p>According to the bio-assay made by Dr. S. Loewe of the
Department of Pharmacology of the Cornell University Medical
School, the strength of the fluid concentrate was found to be
from 71 to 90 per cent of that of the U.S.P. fluid extract for
cannabis marketed by Parke, Davis and Company. The fluid extract
was not miscible with water and had a characteristic,
disagreeable taste which made it easily recognized. For these
reasons the concentrate was evaporated to a viscid consistency
and made into pill form, with glycyrrhiza as the excipient. Each
pill was equivalent to 1 cc. of the concentrate. </p>

<p>For controls, glycyrrhiza pills without marihuana were used.
Several products prepared by Dr. Roger Adams in his investigation
of the chemistry of marihuana were used. A comparison of their
action with that of the concentrate will be found below. In
addition to the concentrate, marihuana cigarettes were used.
These were obtained from supplies confiscated by the New York
City Police. Each contained approximately from .4 to .8 gm. of
marihuana. As the quality of the marihuana varied and the amount
of active principles taken in with the smoke was unknown, there
was no exactness in dosage. In general, however, it appeared that
smoking 2 cigarettes was equivalent to taking 1 pill. </p>

<p>The minimal dose of the concentrate which produced clearcut
effects was 2 cc. During the repeated observations on each member
of the group larger doses were given, commonly up to around 8 cc.
and in one instance up to 22 cc. For smoking, from one to as many
as eleven cigarettes were used. </p>

<h3>The Active Principles.</h3>

<p>Determination of relative potencies of drugs having similar
action can be made on human beings to a limited extent only. The
comparison is based on easily measurable effects on some organ or
system on which the drug has a highly selective action, but the
existing state of the system influences greatly the ensuing
result. </p>

<p>Marihuana effects come mainly from action on the central
nervous system. The type and degree of response of this system to
stimuli of various origins vary in different individuals and in
the same individual at different times. When marihuana is given
the pre-existing state cannot be classified but it has influence
in determining the response, and the same dose of marihuana does
not produce identical effects in different subjects or in one
subject at different times. In general, however, when the dose
given is definitely effective the responses are of a fairly
uniform character. </p>

<p>For this reason the relative potency of the active principles
supplied by Dr. Roger Adams could be determined only
approximately. The principles used were the natural
tetrahydrocannabinol, the synthetic isomer, and the synthetic
hexylhydrocannabinol. These all brought on effects similar to
those of the marihuana concentrate. The estimate of their
relative potency is as follows: 1 cc. of the concentrate,
representing the extraction from 1 Gm, of marihuana, had as its
equivalent 15 mg. of the natural tetrahydrocannabinol, 60 mg. of
the synthetic hexylhydrocannabinol, and 120 mg. of the synthetic
tetra compound. In explaining the differences in the estimated
potencies, the rates of absorption must be taken into account
since the action of marihuana depends on the amount of active
principle absorbed and its concentration in the brain at a
certain time. </p>

<p>The main conclusion is that the action of the marihuana
concentrate is dependent on its tetrahydrocannabinol content and
that the synthetic compounds retain the action of the natural
principle. </p>

<h3>Procedure<br>
</h3>

<p>The procedure for examining the main group of subjects was
adopted in the light of the experience gained from the
preliminary study. </p>

<p>The subjects were brought to the hospital in groups of from
six to ten, and they stayed there from four to six weeks. Each
subject had his history taken and was given a physical
neurological, and psychiatric examination on the day of
admission. </p>

<p>Since it has been shown that pulse variation is the most
constant index of marihuana action, the pulse rate was recorded
every half hour during the day with the subjects at rest for five
minutes before each reading. </p>

<p>During the following days, through careful observation by the
Director, the general make-up of the subject, his personality,
the character of his responsiveness, and his behavior in new
surroundings were determined both before and while he was under
the influence of marihuana. Additional information came through
the nurses' reports. </p>

<p>In addition, each subject was given a series of tests before
and after the administration of marihuana in order that the
changes brought about by the drug might be measured. Included
among these tests were psychological tests for mental functioning
and emotional reactions, psychomotor tests for both simple and
complex psychophysical functions, tests to determine such
abilities as musical aptitude and the perception of time and
space, and laboratory examinations to test the functioning of the
various organs and systems of the body.<br>

<p><b>The LaGuardia Committee Report on Marijuana </b></p>

<h1>FINDINGS </h1>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Rorschach Test</b> </p>

<p>Table 14 gives the Rorschach findings for 45 subjects both in
the undrugged and drugged states. The measurable changes on the
test which occurred during the period of drug intoxication were
few and not far-reaching. They may be considered indications of
tendencies rather than of significant alterations of the
personality. </p>

<p>(TABLE 14) </p>

<p>When the subjects were under the influence of marihuana
(either 3- 6 cc. or cigarettes, the number of cigarettes being at
the discretion of the smoker) there was a slightly freer flow of
associations than there was when they were in the undrugged
state, an increased productivity which coincided with the
impressions obtained from general observation of the subjects
when they were &quot;high.&quot; Without drug the average number
of interpretations made was 20.0, with drug 23.3. This increased
number of responses was due primarily to the subject's greater
awareness of small, extraneous details which in his undrugged
state he overlooked. Thus, while 17 per cent of the subjects'
answers were small or rare detail responses when no marihuana had
been administered, with marihuana this increased to 21 per cent.
Coincidental with his increased absorption in the irrelevant
there was a slight decrease in the subject's drive to organize
and synthesize. Whereas without drug 40 per cent of the responses
involved the entire blot, with drug this was true of only 36 per
cent of the interpretations. Under the influence of marihuana
there was a mild tendency for the subject to become preoccupied
with minutiae rather than to concern himself with the larger,
more important aspects of a situation, and this implies some
falling off in meaningful constructive behavior. </p>

<p>When the subject had taken marihuana there was some decrease
in the objectivity with which he sized up situations. This was
indicated by the fact that without drug 92 per cent of his
interpretations were good form, that is, they corresponded to the
form of the blot, while with drug this percentage fell to 86 per
cent. The drug had an adverse effect on the individual's critical
faculty and he was more prone to jump to erroneous conclusions
than he was when he was in the undrugged state. </p>

<p>The only other change that occurred on the Rorschach test
after the ingestion of marihuana was the decrease in the
subject's ability to think in line with the group. This showed
itself in the decreased number of popular interpretations made,
the drop being from 27 per cent without drug to 20 per cent with
drug. In other words, during the period of drug intoxication an
individual is somewhat less likely to see the obvious and the
commonplace than he is in his normal state. </p>

<p>As important, or possibly even more important, than the
changes which occurred on the Rorschach after ingestion or
smoking of marihuana, is the fact that some of the most basic
personality attributes remained unchanged. Thus it appeared that
33 per cent of the subjects in the undrugged state were what is
described as introversive, that is, they were individuals who
tend to withdraw somewhat from the world about them and depend
primarily on their own inner resources for emotional stimulation;
20 per cent were extraversive, depending mainly on their
environment for affective satisfaction; 20 per cent were
ambivert, showing equal potentialities in both directions; and 27
per cent were emotionally constricted to the point where they
gave little or no evidence of emotional response of any type.
With drug 36 per cent were introversive, 22 per cent were
extraversive, 20 per cent were ambivert, and 22 per cent were
constricted. Marihuana ingestion or smoking served to dilate the
emotional life of only 2 of the subjects and shifted the type of
1. In all 3 cases the change was actually a very slight one. The
fact that the emotional trends remain essentially unchanged under
the influence of marihuana was further revealed by the fact that
the ratio for evaluating the individual's emo tional type, that
is, the ratio of movement to color, remained roughly the same
before and after he had taken the drug, being 2.3:1.6 when he was
in the undrugged state and 2.9:2.1 when he was in the drugged
phase. </p>

<p>Although the quantitative changes occurring with marihuana
ingestion or smoking were not large, there was a qualitative
difference in the protocols obtained from the subjects in the
undrugged and drugged stages. Not only was there a slight
increase in the actual number of interpretations made, but the
amount of talking and extraneous comment increased. The subject
played around with answers and often repeated them. He seemed
anxious to get his every thought clearly across to his audience.
More than this, he was much freer in the type of interpretation
he allowed himself. </p>

<p>For example, one interpretation on Card II read: &quot;Two
dogs. Now wait a minute. I don't want to jump to conclusions but
it looks as if the dogs were having intercourse and there was a
rupture.&quot; This response was not repeated when the subject
was retested in the undrugged state. Nor was this individual
unique in showing this qualitative difference. The disinhibition
and lessening of restraint which was a definitely observable
effect of the drug was also reflected in the assured explanations
and lengthy tirades which the subject offered on topics which in
his undrugged state he would undoubtedly feel were beyond him.
Thus one subject interpreted Card X as &quot;old bark of trees,
roots dried up. It's thousands of years old; it takes thousands
of years to do that. I got to tell you that. I got to cover for
you. You wouldn't know about a thousand years ago. I'm smart
now.&quot; In some instances the &quot;cockiness&quot; induced by
his drugged condition produced an entirely new attitude in the
subject. Instead of the customary deferential, almost
ingratiating approach there was now a confident
&quot;know-it-all&quot; manner. </p>

<p>The effects of marihuana ingestion on user and non-user were
essentially the same, as indicated by the findings in Table 14,
except that on the whole the alterations which did occur were
more marked for the non-user than for the user. Thus, for
example, while the average number of responses given by the user
increased only 11 per cent, those of the non-user rose 26 per
cent. Again, the user when drugged gave only 6 per cent fewer
whole answers as against a decrease of 15 per cent in the whole
responses of the non-user in the drugged state. The user showed a
29 per cent increase in small detail interpretations, the
non-user 31 per cent. There was only a 2 per cent drop in good
form interpretation by the user as against a 12 per cent drop for
the non-user. Only in the loss of popular interpretations did the
user exceed the non-user, his falling off being as great as 31
per cent as compared with 24 per cent for the non-user. While the
number of subjects in both groups was too small to allow of
definite statements, the trend seemed to indicate that the
ingestion or smoking of marihuana has a greater adverse or
disorganizing effect on the neophyte than on the experienced
smoker, again, as was the case in the study of mental
functioning, suggesting the possibility of psychological
habituation. </p>

<p>When the protocols obtained from these marihuana users in
their undrugged state are compared with those of the nonusers or
with the norms postulated for average adults of this age level,
certain deviating personality traits in these users may be noted.
The most striking deviation is the small percentage of users who
showed an extraversive personality. Only 15 per cent of the
marihuana users used in this study responded primarily to
emotional stimuli in the world about them as compared with 28 per
cent of the non-users. </p>

<p>While no definite figures are given in the literature for the
degree of extraversion in the general population, it seems
definitely more than 15 per cent. Altogether the personality
types among the non-users show a much more even distribution than
those among the users as seen in Table 15. Judging by the
personality types the majority of marihuana users lack social
ease and adroitness and are likely to find it difficult to make
good outgoing social contacts. </p>

<p>(TABLE 15) </p>

<p>Sixty-two per cent of the marihuana users' interpretations
were determined by the form or outline of the blot. Such
responses require an objective critical attitude unmodified by
emotional factors. However, when this attitude is maintained to
the point where more than 50 per cent of the answers are of this
nature the individual has a constricted affective life the degree
of constriction being in proportion to the increase in form
interpretations Thus, as was previously noted, there was more
than average emotional inhibition evident among the marihuana
users studied in this experiment. Since emotional inhibition
frequently causes intellectual constriction it is not surprising
to find that the stereotypy in these records was slightly above
expectancy, as indicated by the fact that 59 per cent of the
responses were animal or animal detail interpretations as
compared with a norm of from 25 to 50 per cent. </p>

<p>Finally the marihuana users (as well as the non-users in this
experiment) showed a depressive outlook in that more of their
responses were determined by the gray and black colors than by
the vivid colors. In interpreting this fact it must be borne in
mind that the subjects were all prisoners and their depressive
attitude may have been a reflection of their present situation
rather than of a basic trait. </p>

<p><b>Goodenough Test (Drawing of a Man)</b> </p>

<p>This test is helpful in studying each individual both in the
drugged and undrugged state, but group results are not meaningful
(except for one finding given below) because of a lack of
similarity both in the drawings obtained in the undrugged state
and in the direction of change which occurred after drug
ingestion or smoking. However, certain qualitative findings
proved interesting and are therefore reported here. In a number
of cases the identical drawing was produced in the undrugged, 2
cc., 5 cc., and cigarette state, but the size of the figure
increased consistently with the amount of marihuana taken. This
increase in size may have been a reflection of a physical
sensation induced by the drug, rnay have been due to a tendency
to macrographia which was noted in the writing of some subjects,
or may have been the psychological representation of increased
feelings of confidence and security. </p>

<p>With marihuana there was an increase in the percentage of
subjects who remembered to give their man ears. This again may
have been due to a heightened awareness of ears because of
physical or auditory sensations or might denote a greater
receptivity to what others have to say. </p>

<p>In some cases the amount of time consumed in execution of the
drawings was considerably greater when the subject was
&quot;high.&quot; This additional time was rarely used for
elaborating the picture but was caused by the subject's altered
mood. In many instances the laughter and joking in which he
indulged kept him from completing the job with dispatch. In other
cases depression or nausea slowed him up. Although aware of the
details which should be included, the subject was often satisfied
to indicate such items by a single line or dash rather than
discipline himself to the point where he could make a careful
picture. In some of these cases the drawing had attributes which
resemble the findings sometimes seen in productions of
individuals in a manic mood. </p>

<p>When a person is given a sheet of paper and is asked to draw a
man on it, the paper and the figure he draws become the situation
he must manipulate. If the figure is well centered so that the
finished product gives a balanced composition, the subject has
handled the circumstance in adequate fashion. The one consistent
finding for this test was the fact that the subject's ability to
handle situations was not improved by drug ingestion or smoking.
In the case of both user and non-user the percentage of balanced
compositions produced in the various drug states did not change
from the results obtained in the undrugged condition. It is,
however, interesting to note that 59 per cent of the marihuana
users made &quot;unbalanced&quot; drawings in the undrugged state
as compared with only 29 per cent of the non-users. It may be
inferred from this that fewer users than non-users are inclined
to come out into the center of the scene. This carries with it
implications of poor adjustment and insecurity. </p>

<p><b>Level of Aspiration Test</b> </p>

<p>In the undrugged state the majority of the subjects manifested
reactions which are usual in the experience of other experiments,
namely, the tendency to place their estimate just a little above
their actual performance. This was demonstrated by the fact that
while the average performance time needed for carrying out a set
task (putting sixteen blocks in a box, red side up) was 23.6
seconds, the subjects' average estimate for accomplishing this
was 21.9 seconds. As their performance improved with practice,
the subjects tended to allow themselves less time for the job.
Such statements as, &quot;I should do better this time,&quot; or
&quot;I'll take a chance,&quot; were not infrequent. Some
subjects wanted to know the best score ever made, and worked
energetically to attain it. </p>

<p>With 2 cc. of marihuana there was a slight increase in the
average estimated time for the entire group although there was no
concomitant increase in performance time. Under this dosage the
estimated time was 23.1 seconds, performance time 23.4 seconds.
Although the subject actually took no longer to do the job he
thought he would work more slowly and in predicting his
achievement gave himself more time. His attitude during the test
was a much easier, more happy go-lucky one. He occasionally
stopped in the middle of the experiment to discuss something with
the examiner or call out to someone passing in the hall. There
thus appeared to be a small loss in drive which, though not
revealed by significant statistical differences, was indicated by
the numerical trend and by the subject's attitude toward the
test. </p>

<p>After the ingestion of 5 cc. of marihuana the average
estimated time was 23.2 seconds and the performance time 24.4
seconds. Here the relationship between estimated and performance
time was similar to that found in the undrugged phase, that is,
there was a 1.2 second gap between them. During this drug phase
the subjects seemed less relaxed than they were under 2 cc., and
their main interest seemed to be to get back to bed and be left
undisturbed. </p>

<p>Under the influence of marihuana cigarettes the trend was
similar to that found with 2 cc., the difference between the
estimated time and the performance time being only 0.3 second. As
with 2 cc., subjects behavior was generally happy and relaxed. </p>

<p>When the group was divided into users and non-users the trend
was the same for both. </p>

<p>(TABLE 16) </p>

<p>On the whole it appears that small doses of marihuana and of
marihuana cigarettes tend to lower the individual level of
aspiration, that is, there is a slight lessening in the subject's
drive and his will to achieve. Larger doses (5 cc.) do not
produce this effect. </p>

<p><b>Frustration Test </b></p>

<p>The results of the frustration experiment indicated no
statistically significant differences between the subject's
reactions before and after he had taken marihuana. Again, after
the ingestion of marihuana there was a slight trend toward
lowering the level of aspiration (Table 17), but the over-all
change was not startling when compared with results on the Level
of Aspiration Test when no frustrating experience was introduced.
</p>

<p>(TABLE 17) </p>

<p><b>Binet Lines</b> </p>

<p>Binet's interpretation of this test was based upon the
principle that suggestible individuals, once embarked on a
particular form of activity (in this instance, drawing lines of
increasing length), ale more prone to continue this activity when
the stimulus is altered than are less suggestible people. Judging
by the results as given in Table 18, small doses of marihuana (2
cc. and cigarettes) induced thus type of perseverative behavior
in the users but not in the non- users. In other words, the
marihuana user when under the influence of the drug tended to
continue an activity he had started without being too
discriminatory or controlled about it. The non-user, on the other
hand, showed a curtailment in activity and responsiveness. One
possible explanation of this difference in effect on user and
non-user appears to lie in the fact that the drug made the user
more relaxed and easy-going and less controlled in motor activity
than he was in his undrugged state, while the non-user was often
more tense and disturbed. As was so often the case in the
personality tests, the effect on the user of large doses of the
drug (S cc.) was contrary to that of the small ones, probably
because in many cases he was made physically uncomfortable and
intellectually disorganized. </p>

<p>(TABLE 18) </p>

<p>The lack of consistency in the findings seems to suggest that
the individual's psychological and physiological &quot;set&quot;
toward the drug affects his reaction and behavior. Thus small
doses, which the marihuana user anticipates with pleasure make
him more easy-going and therefore probably more suggestible than
he would be in his undrugged state, while large doses have a
contrary effect. The non-user, on the other hand, appears to be
less suggestible as a result of drug ingestion than he ordinarily
is. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Wechsler Vocational Interest Blank</b> </p>

<p>The average number of positions chosen by the subjects when
they were in the undrugged state was 13.2. With 2 cc. of
marihuana the average was 12.9; with 5 cc., 12.7; and with
cigarettes, 11.8. There was a very slight but not statistically
significant trend toward a decrease in job interest. However, the
absence of any appreciable change in the number of positions
liked after the ingestion or smoking of marihuana indicates that
no real withdrawal is implied. </p>

<p>Analysis of the type of position chosen shows that under the
influence of marihuana there was no swing to the more feminine
occupations, but in the case of some subjects, especially
marihuana users, there was a falling off in the popularity of
some jobs which require considerable activity. For example, under
the influence of 2 cc. of marihuana or of marihuana cigarettes
the jobs of detective, policeman and taxi driver were found among
his least desired occupations though they were not in this place
when he was in the undrugged state. </p>

<p>The trend was the same for the user and the non-user in both
the drugged and undrugged phase. For the user the jobs of
aviator, gymnasium teacher, newspaper reporter, sailor and
soldier were most frequently chosen; for the non-user aviator,
doctor, explorer, forest ranger, newspaper reporter and prize
fighter were most popular. </p>

<p><b>Loofbourrow Personal Index: Test I</b> </p>

<p>Before taking marihuana, the user and non-user on an average
indicated familiarity with an identical number of words, 65.2.
After he had smoked marihuana cigarettes, the user's vocabulary
showed a gain of 6 words, the non-user's 5 words. In both cases
the subject's confidence in his verbal capacity was enhanced by
the use of marihuana.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Wechsler Free Association Test</b> </p>

<p>In the undrugged state the user and non-user were disturbed by
the same stimulus words, namely &quot;lonely,&quot;
&quot;passionate,&quot; &quot;insult,&quot; and &quot;sin.&quot;
The only differences were the disturbance the user showed in
response to the words &quot;wish&quot; and &quot;murder&quot; and
the delayed reaction of the non-user to the word
&quot;pity.&quot; </p>

<p>Under the influence of 5 cc. of marihuana or of marihuana
cigarettes the user was less disturbed by all these words with
the possible exception of &quot;insult,&quot; but there was a
sharp increase in the agitation aroused by the words
&quot;suicide&quot; and &quot;death.&quot; It appears that the
feeling of well-being produced by the drug tended to alleviate
the loneliness, guilt, and frustration which the subject felt,
but it was also accompanied by a fear of death. This may be tied
up with the anxiety the marihuana user always experiences in
regard to the amount of drug he is taking, the always present
fear of his &quot;blowing his top,&quot; or it may be a
reflection of the problems which were most disturbing to him. </p>

<p>The non-user, after taking marihuana, was also less disturbed
by the words &quot;lonely,&quot; &quot;passionate,&quot; and
&quot;sin.&quot; His reaction to &quot;pity&quot; was also
diminished but he, too, was still upset by the word
&quot;insult.&quot; The new disturbing stimulus words were not
those which upset the user but those which were more closely
related to his own immediate problems namely &quot;honest,&quot;
&quot;money,&quot; and &quot;sex.&quot; Since the non-user in our
group was generally an individual who had been sent to prison
because of stealing or a sex offense, it seems it was these
problems which the disinhibiting action of the drug brought to
the fore.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Pressey X-O Test</b> </p>

<p>This test was taken by only 10 subjects, 5 users and 5
nonusers. In general, the smoking of marihuana brought about some
increase in the number of words which had an unpleasant meaning
to the subject and in the number of things about which he had
worried. There was some decrease in the number of things for
which the drugged subject thought a person should be blamed. The
number of his associations with any one word remained roughly the
same in the drugged and undrugged state. </p>

<p>Although less inclined to censure when under the influence of
marihuana, the subject was nevertheless more readily disturbed
and worried. This undercurrent of irritability and anxiety seemed
to be a concomitant of the more obvious feeling of general
well-being which is the predominant effect of the drug. Two
possible explanations can be given here for this finding: the
physiological changes occurring with the smoking -of the drug
gave the subject a feeling of anxiety, and the disinhibition
which occurred at this time released the restraints which had
been imposed not only on the happier reactions but on all the
repressed unpleasantness as well, and things which the subject
had repressed because he wished to forget them now came to the
fore. This was noted when at least two of the subjects had
&quot;crying jags&quot; when drugged, reproaching themselves for
what they had done to their mothers and wives.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Downey Will-Temperament Test: Test I</b> </p>

<p>The changes in the subjects' responses on this test showed a
shift in their attitude toward themselves as a result of
marihuana ingestion. On the whole, more subjects appeared to
think better of themselves when they were &quot;high&quot; than
they did in their undrugged state. This is indicated by the fact
that there was an increase in the number of individuals who under
the influence of 5 cc. of marihuana or of marihuana cigarettes
believed themselves to be careful, cautious, ambitious, accurate,
industrious, impulsive, enthusiastic, and possessing superior
characters. There was also a decrease in the number who
considered themselves suggestible or extravagant. The only
negative traits which the subject admitted to more frequently
when he was &quot;high&quot; than he did in his normal state were
suggestibility, poor memory and aggression. The change in
attitude in regard to aggression was most striking among the
marihuana users, 88 per cent of whom considered themselves
aggressive after they had had the drug as compared with only 42
per cent in the undrugged state. This increase in the feeling of
aggression was not paralleled by the findings of the other tests
nor by the behavior of the subjects when they had taken the drug.
Like the increased vocabulary noted on the Loofbourrow it can
best be interpreted as an indication of the subject's increased
feelings of confidence and self-assurance. </p>

<p>(Table 19)<br>
</p>

<p>In general the changes which occurred on this test after the
subject had had marihuana were not consistent for the user and
the non-user or for different amounts of the drug. They merely
served to indicate that when the subject was under the influence
of marihuana there were shifts in his feelings about himself
which reflected a prevailing mood of confidence and self-
satisfaction. </p>

<p>Thematic Apperception Test </p>

<p>Without cigarettes the needs most frequently expressed in the
subjects' stories were &quot;affiliation,&quot;
&quot;aggression,&quot; &quot;sex,&quot; &quot;dominance,&quot;
&quot;succorance,&quot; &quot;self-abasement,&quot; and
&quot;play.&quot; These terms may be defined as follows:(1)
Affiliation: to be sociable, to make friends, to love.
Aggression: to fight, to criticize, to blame, to accuse or
ridicule maliciously, to injure or kill, sadism. Sex: to seek sex
objects, to court, to enjoy intercourse. Dominance: to influence
or control others, leadership. Succorance: to seek aid,
protection or sympathy. Selfabasement: to comply, to surrender,
to accept punishment, to apologize, to condone, to atone, to
depreciate ego, masochism. Play: to relax tension and alleviate
stress by pleasurable and humorously irresponsible activity,
motor, verbal or mental. </p>

<p>In general the frequency with which all needs were expressed
fell off after the subjects had smoked marihuana cigarettes. The
most striking drops were in the need for self-abasement and
aggression where the frequency of occurrence changed from 2.4 to
1.1 for the former, and from 2.7 to 1.7 for the latter. Contrary
to the general trend there was an increase in the need for
dominance. </p>

<p>When the subjects were not &quot;high&quot; the environmental
influences most frequently mentioned in their stories were
illness and death and accepting parents. After smoking marihuana
the general trend was similar to that noted for the
&quot;needs,&quot; that is there was a falling off in the
frequency with which the subjects used most of the concepts. </p>

<p>There was, however, no diminution in the number of times that
illness and death played a part in their tales, the average
number being 2.1 before smoking and 2.2 after smoking. Likewise
the awareness of restraint and imprisonment remained constant,
occurring 1.1 times before smoking and 1.2 after. Contrary to the
general trend there was an increased awareness of an accepting
love object. This concept appeared in the stories on an average
of .8 time before smoking and 1.2 after. </p>

<p>The decrease in the number of times both needs and
environmental pressures were expressed in the stories given after
the subjects had had cigarettes was not due to a curtailment in
the length of the story. The tales were often more wordy in the
drugged than in the undrugged state, but their length was
frequently due to embellishment and repetition, and there was
likely to be less meaningful material. In general the stories
obtained from the subjects after smoking indicated that they had
less capacity for expressing themselves directly and clearly, and
also less concern with self-abasement and aggression. As defined
on this test these needs represent a conflict between aggression
against the self and against others and appear to stem from
insecurity and feelings of guilt and inadequacy. In the drugged
state the subjects appeared less disturbed by this conflict and
had less need to harry themselves and others. They had a greater
need for dominance, a desire for leadership. This ties in with
the greater self-assurance demonstrated by other tests and with
the increased awareness of acceptance by a love object found on
this test. </p>

<p>It is interesting to note that these subjects showed no
falling off in their awareness of illness and death or of
restraint and imprisonment after smoking. The frequency of the
latter concept was undoubtedly related to their status as
prisoners, while the former ties in with the findings on the Free
Association Test where the word &quot;death&quot; remained a
disturbing factor even after marihuana had been smoked or
ingested. </p>

Robert W. White and R. Nevitt-Sanford, Harvard Psychological
Clinic, February 1941. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>FINDINGS ON WOMEN SUBJECTS</b> </p>

<p>As in the case with the men, when the female subject was under
the influence of marihuana her basic personality structure did
not change and only some relatively superficial emotional
reactions were different. As a group, the women used in this
study showed a somewhat constricted personality, and this
constriction was not lessened when the subject was
&quot;high.&quot; The emotional reactions revealed in the
Rorschach Test showed that the subjects in this particular group
were primarily extraversive, and this remained unchanged after
the administration of marihuana. Again, like the men, when under
the influence of the drug the women lowered the achievement
levels they set for themselves. However, they did not show any
increased self-confidence as did the men, either by an increase
in the number of words they claimed to know in the Loofbourrow
Test or in their appraisal of themselves as indicated in the
Downey Will-Temperament Test. In general, the women exhibited a
loss of drive for participation in anything requiring effort.
This is inferred from their performance in the Level of
Aspiration Test, the Vocational Interest Blank, and the Binet
Lines Test, as well as from their behavior. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>BEHAVIOR DURING THE TEST PERIOD OF SUBJECTS UNDER THE
INFLUENCE OF MARIHUANA</b> </p>

<p>The findings reported here have all been in terms of
objective, quantitative measures. Some effects of the drug,
observable during examinations, cannot be quantified but are
nevertheless important to the understanding of the drug action.
These effects were reflected in those reactions of the subjects
which were not directly related to the test situation Behavior
was somewhat different when the subject had ingested marihuana
concentrate than it was when he had taken the drug in cigarette
form. With pills gastrointestinal disturbances were more
pronounced and drowsiness and fatigue seemed greater and more
enduring. Some individuals were so overcome by fatigue that they
worked for a few seconds only, and then sat with their heads on
the table. If spoken to, they made a great effort to do the work
but rarely continued for very long. When summoned to take the
test, especially toward the end of the day when they were almost
invariably lying on their beds, the subjects were overcome with
fatigue and were aroused only with the greatest difficulty. In
some instances there was definite resentment of this disturbance
and the impression was that only the presence of the police
officer and all the implications in the prison set-up prevented a
definite refusal to continue cooperatively. With both pills and
cigarettes many of the men had difficulty in concentrating and
maintaining a fixed goal. Subjects often stared vacantly for long
periods and when addressed came back to the test with a start.
Many burst into uncontrollable laughter over a test which in
their undrugged state had evoked no merriment. The laughter
frequently affected the entire group and most markedly those who
had been given marihuana. </p>

<p>The behavior of the user and non-user with marihuana
cigarettes was somewhat different. The user was pleasantly
excited at the thought of smoking, selected his cigarettes with
the manner of a connoisseur, and criticized or praised the
product offered him. His smoking took on something of a
ritualistic ceremony and was done in a careful and prearranged
fashion which varied slightly from individual to individual. In
general the men first opened the end of the cigarette to examine
the marihuana, then wet the &quot;stick&quot; by inserting it in
their mouths to prevent the paper from burning too rapidly. When
the cigarette was ignited the men took several short puffs, at
the same time inhaling as much air as possible. This caused the
tip of the &quot;stick&quot; to glow and resulted in a succession
of low gasping sounds from the subject The smoke was retained as
long as possible, occasionally causing severe paroxysms of
coughing. Although eager to be &quot;high&quot; the user was
consistent in his fear of &quot;blowing his top,&quot; and there
was always a point beyond which no amount of talking or cajoling
could make them continue smoking. </p>

<p>As a rule, the user liked to smoke in company. He was
generally satisfied if one friend, a &quot;kick partner,&quot;
could be with him. To this friend he would explain his thoughts
and feelings which to the objective observer were very
superficial. In trying to make a point, and usually a minor one
at that, the user, when smoking, would talk on endlessly and soon
lose his goal. He cracked many &quot;jokes&quot; which were
uproariously funny to him. In some instances &quot;leaping&quot;
or involuntary jerking of the arms, head, shoulders or legs
occurred The subject described his sensations as floating,
leaping, rocking or most often as being &quot;in the
groove.&quot; He was obviously enjoying pleasant physical
sensations and wanted to be left to himself to lie on his bed,
listen to soft music and dream or carry on &quot;deep&quot;
conversations. The test questions were frequently called a
&quot;bring down&quot; in that they forced the subject to face
reality and abandon his pleasurable feelings. Several subjects
concurred in describing part of their drug experience as
comparable to the twilight state between sleeping and waking in
which the individual floats pleasantly and does not allow outside
stimuli to impinge. Just as strong extraneous sensations will
bring the sleeper face to face with reality, so the insistence of
the examiner that the subject perform certain tasks served to
destroy his general feeling of well-being. Aside from the test
situation any unpleasant circumstances can serve as a &quot;bring
down.&quot; This &quot;bring down&quot; apparently only results
in destroying the subject's pleasure but cannot do away with the
disadvantageous effect on intellectual functioning. </p>

<p>When testing was completed the subject generally lay on his
bed and dozed or listened to the radio. His drowsiness persisted
for many hours. </p>

<p>Most non-users approached the smoking with apprehension. They
were instructed by the users in the art of lighting and inhaling,
but they rarely cooperated to the fullest extent? though this was
undoubtedly unconscious on their part. </p>

<p>The effects of marihuana on the non-users were variable. A few
of them enjoyed the results so much that they claimed they would
continue to smoke whenever they had a chance. They described such
sensations as &quot;lying in fur,&quot; and &quot;floating in
space.&quot; Some became acutely nauseous and could not continue
with their work, while others experienced little or no change in
feeling, undoubtedly because they never smoked correctly. </p>

<p>When the subjects were &quot;high,&quot; particularly in the
case of the non- user, there was a general loss of inhibition and
lessening of many social restraints which had previously been
exercised. Thus, all the men talked much more freely, confronted
each other more directly, and manifested a state of well-being at
times amounting to euphoria. They were much more confiding?
talked spontaneously about love and sexual affairs, and in two
instances exposed themselves and masturbated. </p>

<p>Although there was an undeniable increase in overt sex
interest following the ingestion of marihuana, it seems probable
that this interest was not the result of direct sexual
stimulation but rather a manifestation of a falling off in
inhibiting factors. This sex interest seems to have been due
primarily to the fact that these men had been imprisoned for
varying periods and had not had access to women. It is not at all
certain that under free conditions or with different subjects
this behavior would have been manifested. In any case, the
behavior of these prisoners was more like that which any man
deprived of sexual activity for a long period of time would
display under a releasing stimulus and not at all like the
behavior shown at marihuana &quot;tea-pads.&quot;<br>

<h2>CHAPTER TWO : THE DRUGS AND THEIR EFFECTS </h2>

<p>INTRODUCTION </p>

<p>20. The primary purpose of this chapter is to review in
preliminary fashion the current scientific knowledge of certain
psychotropic drugs used non-medically in Canada. In addition,
this section will introduce a few basic concepts which may be
helpful to the understanding of some of the potentials and
limitations of the scientific method as applied to the study of
human behaviour and drugs.* Psychopharmacology, the branch of
science specifically concerned with these issues, can be defined
as the study of the interaction of drugs with ongoing
psychological and behavioural activity. </p>

<p>A certain amount of the current controversy and lack of
communication regarding the 'drug problem' has been attributed to
the multitude of meanings that the term 'drug' has to different
people, and to the often arbitrary way in which our society
defines, and endeavours to solve, the problems arising from man's
persistent use of chemical substances to alter his existence. To
some people the word 'drug' means a medicine used in the
prevention, diagnosis, of treatment of an abnormal or
pathological condition. In other situations, it is often used to
refer only to illegal or socially disapproved substances. Some
individuals employ the word in a manner suggesting dependence or
addiction, regardless of whether it refers to some chemical
substance or to other preoccupations such as television, music,
books, or sports and games. Some consider alcohol, tea and coffee
as drugs, while to others these are simply normal beverages not
to be confused with the more foreign and unfamiliar substances
viewed as drugs. Furthermore, the terms 'drug' and 'narcotic' are
given special meanings in legal areas. </p>

<p>* A glossary of technical terms, as used in this report, is
presented at the end of this volume. </p>

<p>Even scientists frequently disagree as to the precise
definition of the term 'drug'. </p>

<p>Modell164 has suggested a comprehensive pharmacological
definition of drugs which the Commission has adopted. As noted in
Chapter One, a <i>drug </i>is considered to be any <i>substance
that by its chemical nature alters structure or function in the
living organism. </i>Modell observed that: </p>

<p>Drug action is therefore a general biological phenomenon ...
pharmacologic effects are exerted by foods, vitamins, hormones,
microbial metabolites, plants, snake venoms, stings, products of
decay, air pollutants, pesticides, minerals, synthetic chemicals,
virtually all foreign materials (very few are completely inert)
and many materials normally in the body. </p>

<p>While this interpretation may be too broad for certain
practical purposes, it provides some perspective into the
ubiquitous nature of our internal and external chemical
environment, and the complexity of the question of human drug
use. The Commission's primary concern is focused on the use and
effects of drugs taken for their <i>psychotropic or psychoactive </i>properties
as defined by their capacity to <i>alter sensation, mood,
consciousness or other psychological or behavioural functions.</i>
</p>

<p>21. The use of psychoactive drugs seems to be an almost
universal phenomenon and has apparently occurred throughout
recorded history, in almost all societies. Some scholars have
suggested that this use of drugs may have been among the earliest
behavioural characteristics distinguishing man from the other
animals. Blum, in the United States <i>Task Force Report </i>(1967),
has stated:27 </p>

<p>Mind-altering drug use is common to mankind. Such drugs have
been employed for millennia in almost all cultures. In our work
we have been able to identify only a few societies in the world
today where no mind-altering drugs are used; these are small and
isolated cultures. Our own society puts great stress on
mind-altering drugs as desirable products which are used in many
acceptable ways (under medical supervision, as part of the family
home remedies, in self-medication, in social use [alcohol, tea
parties, coffee klatches, etc.] and in private use [cigarettes,
etc.] ). In terms of drug use, 'the rarest or most abnormal form
of behaviour is not to take any mind-altering drugs at all.... If
one is to use the term 'drug user', it applies to nearly all of
us. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">The
Role of Science </h3>

<p>22. It has been suggested that the potential role of science
in the solution of the 'drug problem' is to provide information
to better enable individuals and society to make informed and
discriminating decisions regarding the availability and use of
particular drugs. Unfortunately, considerable disparity often
exists between the need for such information and the capacity of
science to acquire and communicate it. </p>

<p>Helen Nowlis has noted: 172 </p>

<p>There are many reasons why the 'facts' invoked in
non-scientific discussions of drugs are often not facts at all.
They may be second or third-hand quotations of statements
attributed to scientists. There is a readiness on the part of
many to accept as 'scientific fact' any statement made by, or
attributed to, someone labelled as scientist, whether it is a
statement based on research, on uncontrolled observation, or
merely on personal opinion. </p>

<p>While science may be able to serve as a useful guideline and
source of information, science itself is not a policy-making
process, but merely a practical system designed to explore and
test notions of a certain abstract nature. Even though the aim of
science is to maximize objectivity, the interpretation and
application of scientific data is usually a subjective venture
regardless of the controls maintained in the formal analyses. The
practical use of such information in the social sphere often
entails economic, legal, philosophical and moral issues which are
not amenable to scientific analysis as we know it today. </p>

<p>Even though considerable progress has been made in advancing
our knowledge of biology, science has provided only a minimal
understanding of the essential nature of psychological and
behavioural functions and their relationship to underlying
physiological processes. Consequently, psychopharmacology today
must be content with exploring the interaction of chemicals
(often with certain identified physical characteristics) with a
largely unknown largely unknown human psychobiological system of
enormous complexity. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">The
Classification of Drugs </h3>

<p>23. Drug classifications, based on a variety of different
considerations have been developed and there appears to be little
general agreement as to the optimal scheme for ordering the
universe of biologically active substances. For example, drugs
might be organized according to chemical structure,
clinical-therapeutic use, potential health hazards, liability to
non-medical use, public availability and legality, effects on
specific neural or other physiological systems, or influence on
certain psychological and behavioural processes. The
classification systems developed from these different approaches
may show considerable overlap, although there are often striking
incongruities. For example, some drugs which appear very similar
in chemical structure may be quite different in pharmacological
activity and vice-versa. The most useful organization depends on
the intended use of the classifications. </p>

<p>Since our major concern here is with the effects of
psychologically active substances, our interim drug
classification system is based primarily on general psychological
and pharmacological considerations. In Table I eight major
classes are presented along with some examples of drugs from each
group. While the categories are not considered to be exhaustive,
the general system is applicable to the majority of drugs used
for their psychological effects. Since the effects of drugs
depend on a vast number of psychological and physiological
components, many of which seem unpredictable, these categories
are to some extent based on a typical reaction by an average
subject to a common dose. Large variations in any of various
factors can greatly alter the effects and may reduce the
reliability of the descriptions. </p>

<p>(b) Little or no medical use. </p>

<p>* Registered Trade Name </p>

<p>24. The <i>sedatives</i> and <i>hypnotics</i> (e.g., alcohol,
barbiturates, 'sleeping pills' and minor tranquillizers)
generally decrease central nervous system (CNS) arousal (although
some psychological stimulation may result at low doses). Most of
these drugs are used medically to reduce anxiety and tension, to
produce general sedation and, at higher doses, sleep. The
anticholinergic substances (e.g., belladonna alkaloids) are often
used as sedatives at low doses although larger amounts may
produce excitation and delirium. </p>

<p>25. The <i>stimulants </i>(e.g., amphetamines or 'speed',
'diet' and 'pep pills', caffeine, and cocaine) generally suppress
appetite, increase activity, alertness, tension and general CNS
arousal, and, at higher doses, block sleep. Tobacco (nicotine and
coal tars) is usually considered a physiological stimulant
although a variety of other effects are not uncommon. </p>

<p>26. The third group includes drugs described as <i>psychedelic
</i>(mind-manifesting), <i>hallucinogenic </i>(hallucination-producing),
<i>psychotomimetic </i>(psychosis-imitating), <i>illusinogenic </i>(illusion-producing),
and <i>psychodysleptic </i>(mind-disrupting). While these terms
refer to somewhat overlapping effects alleged to occur with the
drugs in this class, the various labels emphasize different
characteristics which are neither synonymous nor necessarily
mutually exclusive. Probably none are entirely adequate as
descriptive terms. These drugs may produce profound alteration in
sensation, mood and consciousness at doses which result in
comparatively light physiological activity . LSD and marijuana
are examples from this group. The medical value of these drugs is
the subject of considerable current controversy. </p>

<p>27. The drugs in the fourth category have, traditionally been
referred to as narcotics or opiates, and are derivatives of, or
pharmacologically related to, products of the opium plant. The
best known examples are heroin, morphine and codeine. The word
'narcotic' has been used inconsistently in scientific as well as
lay language and has been the subject of considerable
disagreement in legal matters (for example, marijuana, cocaine,
and other non-opiates are frequently controlled under laws
regulating narcotics, in spite of the fact that they are
pharmacologically different from this group). The use of the term
'opiates' is generally more specific, although its application
has not always been limited to these drugs. Consequently, the
specific term <i>opiate narcotics </i>is suggested to reduce
ambiguity. These drugs are used medically mainly for their
pain-relieving effects. </p>

<p>28. The fifth group is an aggregate of chemically diverse
substances perhaps best described on a physical basis as <i>volatile
solvents. </i>They are usually inhaled and include the vapour of
such common materials as glue, gasoline and lacquer thinner. Some
of these drugs have been called <i>deliriants </i>although
delirium is only one of many potential effects and is clearly not
restricted to these substances. Many are quite similar in effect
to the sedative group and might be considered in a sub-class of
that category. Others may have slight psychedelic or
hallucinogenic effects. Most of these substances have no known
medical use although several have been employed as clinical
anaesthetics. </p>

<p>29. The <i>non-narcotic analgesics </i>(e.g., Aspirin* and
Phenacetin*) are primarily used to reduce aching pain and to
lower fever. In some instances they may also serve as mild
sedatives. </p>

<p>30. The <i>clinical anti-depressants </i>(e.g., Tofranil* and
Nardil*) are used medically to improve mood in severely depressed
patients. These drugs are rarely used for non-medical purposes
since they have little effect on normal mood states. </p>

<p>31. The final group, the <i>major tranquillizers, </i>are
primarily used to reduce the symptoms of severe psychosis (e.g.,
schizophrenia). Largactil* and reserpine are examples. While
these have initiated a widespread revolution in chemo-therapy in
psychiatry, they are rarely involved in non-medical use. </p>

<p>* Throughout this chapter an asterisk indicates a registered
drug trade name. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Psychological
Considerations </h3>

<p>32. The general effect of most drugs is greatly influenced by
a variety of psychological and environmental factors. Unique
qualities of an individual's personality, his past history of
drug experience, his attitudes towards the drug, his expectations
of its effects and his motivation for taking it are extremely
important and in some instances may completely obscure the
typical pharmacological response to a drug. These factors are
often referred to collectively as the person's mental 'set'. 'The
'setting' or total environment in which the drug is taken may
also be a factor of major significance. </p>

<p>A few drinks of alcohol may produce drowsiness and fatigue in
some situations, while the same individual under different
circumstances may be psychologically stimulated and aroused by
the same dose. It appears that the set and setting may be of
greater significance with the psychedelic-hallucinogenic
substances than with the other drugs, and it has been suggested
that psychological factors may often be the primary components in
determining the quality or character of the psychedelic drug
experience. </p>

<p>The so-called <i>placebo effect </i>is a striking example of
the importance of set and setting in determining the drug
response. A placebo, in this context, refers to a
pharmacologically inactive substance which elicits a significant
reaction, entirely because of what the individual expects or
desires to happen. In certain individuals in some settings a
placebo substance may have surprisingly powerful consequences.
The placebo effect is specific to the individual and the setting,
and not to any chemical properties of the substance involved.
Therefore, in spite of an apparent 'drug effect', the placebo is
not considered a drug since it does not alter function 'by its
chemical nature'. </p>

<p>Placebos have been reported in therapeutic situations to
significantly relieve such symptoms as headache and a variety of
other pains, hay fever, colds, seasickness, neuroses, and a
number of gastrointestinal complaints.97 Some scientists have
suggested that the bulk of medical history may actually have been
a history of the placebo, since many 'effective cures' of the
past have been shown to be without relevant direct
pharmacological action, and are today of no value as therapeutic
agents. </p>

<p>To control for the influence of such psychological factors in
drug research, testing is usually done under at least two
conditions: an assessment is made using the actual drug of
interest, and a separate measurement is taken after a placebo is
given under identical circumstances. By comparing these two
conditions some of the effects of set and setting can often be
controlled and the actual drug effect uncovered. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Pharmacological
Considerations </h3>

<p>33. In studying how drugs affect the body, pharmacologists
generally divide the analysis into several processes: </p>

<p>1. <i>Administration: </i>how does the drug enter the body? </p>

<p>2. <i>Absorption: </i>how does the drug get from the site of
administration into the physiological system of the body? </p>

<p>3. <i>Distribution: </i>how is the drug distributed to various
areas in the body? </p>

<p>4. <i>Action: </i>how and where does the drug produce what
effects? </p>

<p><i>5.</i> <i>Physiological Fate: </i>how is the drug
inactivated, metabolized, and/or eliminated from the body? </p>

<p>Different routes or modes of administration can have
considerable influence on the latency, duration, intensity and
the general nature of the drug effect. Many drugs are well
absorbed from the stomach and intestines after ingestion while
others are poorly taken up or may be destroyed by the gastric
juices. Certain drugs may be injected, with a hypodermic syringe
for example, just under the skin (subcutaneous or S.C,), into the
muscle (intramuscular or I.M.), or into a blood vein (intravenous
or I.V.). The effects are generally most rapid and intense after
intravenous injection and, consequently, this mode of
administration can be quite dangerous in inexperienced hands. In
addition, certain volatile substances can be rapidly and
efficiently absorbed from the lungs by inhalation. </p>

<p>34. The action of a drug is in many cases terminated by
chemical changes which it undergoes in the body, Certain organs
(often the liver) metabolize or 'break down' the original
substance into other chemicals which are usually (but not always)
less active and more easily eliminated from the body. Some drugs
may be excreted unchanged in the urine, faeces, or breath. Action
is not always terminated by excretion, however, and the effects
of some drugs greatly outlast the actual presence of the chemical
in the body. Numerous physiological factors alter absorption,
distribution, action and fate, and must therefore be taken into
consideration in the study of drug effects. </p>

<p>The details of cellular physiology are largely unknown and
with rare exceptions there is little information as to the
mechanism by which any particular drug changes the activity of
the nervous system. At the simplest level, it appears that a drug
alters the functioning of the living cell by entering into some
sort of chemical combination with substances already present.
Even if this molecular process were well understood, it would not
provide a straightforward basis for predicting the overall
effects of the drug on a group of interacting cells, or, at
higher level, on the total nervous system (comprising billions of
cells) and associated psychological and behavioural processes. </p>

<p><i>35. The importance of dose. </i>One of the basic principles
of pharmacology is that specific statements about drug effects
can not be made without consideration of the quantity or dose of
the drug involved. With all drugs, the response differs both in
the intensity and the character of the reaction, according to the
amount of the drug administered. The relation between the dose
and the intensity of an effect is often referred to by scientists
as the <i>dose-response or dose-effect relationship.</i> </p>

<p>Although the magnitude of the effects of some drugs may
increase in a rather uniform (monotonic) fashion as dose is
increased, other drugs, particularly the sedatives, may show a <i>bi-phasic
response </i>and actually produce behaviourally opposite effects
at some doses compared to others. Low doses of alcohol may, in
certain instances, be somewhat stimulating, while higher doses
generally have a strong sedating effect. Scopolamine (a
belladonna alkaloid) may produce sedation at low doses, and
excitation, delirium and hallucinations with larger quantities.
Very toxic doses of this drug can again produce sedation, coma
and even death. </p>

<p>For every drug there is a dose low enough so as to produce<b> </b>no
noticeable reaction, and at the opposite extreme, some degree of
toxicity or poisoning can be produced by any substance if enough
is taken. The concept of a poison, in fact, really refers to the
quantity of a drug which exceeds the body's capacity to cope with
it without damage. No drug can be designated either safe,
beneficial, or harmful without consideration of the dose likely
to be consumed. Chlorine, for example, which is present in most
urban drinking water in concentration so low as to have little or
no pharmacological effect on humans, is intended to poison
harmful bacteria. The same substance, highly concentrated in
gaseous form, was developed during World War I as an extremely
potent respiratory poison. Even the concept of a psychotropic
drug implies some notion of the range of doses likely to be
consumed, since almost any drug can, in high quantities, affect
psychological function. In many instances, however, considerable
physical toxicity or poisoning develops before significant
psychological effects occur. </p>

<p>It is usually essential to study a drug's effect over a range
of doses in order to obtain an adequate understanding of the
nature of the response. It is also important to consider doses
which have some relevance to existing or potential patterns of
use if social implications are to be inferred from experimental
findings. </p>

<p><i>36. The importance of time. </i>Another important
pharmacological concept is the <i>time-response relationship </i>or
the relation between the time which has elapsed since
administration and the effect produced. Such a temporal analysis
may be restricted to immediate or short-term (acute) effects of a
single dose, or on the other extreme, may involve the long-term
effects of persistently repeated (chronic) use of a drug. </p>

<p>The intensity and often the character or quality of the
overall drug effect may change substantially within a short
period of time. For example, the main intoxicating effects of a
large dose of alcohol generally reach a peak in less than an
hour, then gradually taper off. An initially stimulating effect
may later change to one of sedation. With some drugs, an initial
state of tension or anxiety may later turn into one of relaxation
and sense of well-being, or vice-versa, as a function of time. </p>

<p>It may also be important with some drugs to consider the
long-term consequences of chronic use. Usually such effects can
not be readily predicted from what is known of the immediate
response. For instance, while there is little doubt that the
smoking of a few tobacco cigarettes has no lasting detrimental
effect on lung or cardiac function, there is increasing
scientific evidence that long-term heavy use of this substance
has serious consequences. As another example, the clinical
picture of the chronic alcoholic involves psychological and
physiological disturbances which do not develop with moderate
drinking. In simple terms, it is essential to ask: 'How much?';
'How often?'; and 'For how long?' (as well as 'By whom?') when
discussing the long-term reaction to repeated drug use. </p>

<p>37. <i>Main effects and side effects. </i>It is highly
unlikely that any drug has only a single action on a particular
behavioural or physiological function. Most drugs can produce an
almost unlimited number of effects on the body, each with a
somewhat unique dose-response and time-response relationship. The
relative strength of the different responses to a drug generally
varies with the amount taken, and a particular effect which is
prominent at one dosage level may be quite secondary at another. </p>

<p>In a therapeutic or clinical setting, one is usually
interested in a single or perhaps a small number of the many
possible effects. Those which are desired are generally
considered 'main effects' whilst the other unwanted but
concurrent drug responses are labelled 'side effects'. This
distinction between main and side effects is a relative one and
depends on the purpose or the anticipated use of the drug. A
response which is considered unnecessary or undesirable in one
application may, in fact, be the main or desired effect in
another. For example, in the clinical treatment of severe pain,
the analgesic (pain-reducing) properties of morphine are
considered the main effect, and the psychological euphoria and
the intestinal constipation also produced are undesirable side
effects. To the 'street addict', however, the euphoric properties
are the main effects, and the analgesic and constipating effects
may be irrelevant or undesired. Certain opiate compounds such as
paregoric are used in treatment of diarrhoea and, in this
instance, the constipating effect of the drug is desired and the
other responses are considered side effects. It is universal that
drugs have undesirable and toxic side effects if the dose is
sufficiently increased. </p>

<p><i>38. Drug interaction. </i>Even in cases where the
individual effects of different drugs are well known and
reliable, if several substances are taken at the same time, tile
interaction may produce a response which is quite unpredictable
on the basis of the knowledge of the individual drugs alone. Less
commonly, a particular interaction effect may be anticipated. If
the drugs normally have similar properties, they may often have
an additive effect if taken together, resulting in a general
increase in responses similar to that produced by a larger single
dose of either one. There are also instances in which one drug
may potentiate the action of another, and the two together
produce a greater effect than would be expected by merely adding
the individual reactions. Furthermore, some drugs have
antagonistic effects, and one may counteract or inhibit certain
normal responses to the other. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Tolerance
and Dependence </h3>

<p>38a<i>. Tolerance is said to develop when the response to the
same dose of a drug decreases with repeated use. </i>With most
tolerance-producing drugs, effects of original intensity can be
retained. to a certain extent, if the dose is increased. The
extent of tolerance, and the rate at which it is acquired, depend
on the drug, the individual using it, and the magnitude and
frequency of administration. The body does not lose sensitivity
to all aspects of the reaction to a particular drug with equal
rapidity, or to the same degree. Some of the effects of a drug
may 'drop out' sooner than others with repeated use. Tolerance to
the effects which are reinforcing or rewarding drug use (i.e.,
'main effects') is usually reflected by a tendency for users to
increase dose. Most aspects of tolerance dissipate with
abstinence from the drug. </p>

<p>A moderate degree of tolerance to most effects of alcohol and
barbiturates develops and a heavy drinker may be able to consume
two to three times the alcohol tolerated by a novice. Little
tolerance develops to the lethal toxicity of these drugs,
however, and a heavy user of sedatives is just as susceptible to
death by overdose as is a non-tolerant individual. Opiate
narcotics, such as morphine, are capable of producing profound
tolerance, and heavy users have been known to take up to ten
times the amount which would normally produce death. By contrast,
no noticeable tolerance develops to cocaine (a short-acting
stimulant). </p>

<p>The exact mechanisms by which the body adapts, or becomes
tolerant, to different drug effects are not completely
understood, although several processes have been suggested.
Certain drugs (e.g., barbiturates) stimulate the body's
production of the metabolic enzymes which inactivate them. In
addition, there is evidence that a considerable degree of central
nervous system (CNS) tolerance may develop to certain drugs
independent of changes in the rate of absorption, metabolism or
excretion. An individual tolerant to alcohol, for example, can be
relatively unaffected by a large dose even though the resulting
high level of alcohol in his blood may accurately reflect the
magnitude of his intake. It is uncertain as to whether this
represents some general molecular adaptation to the drug at the
level of the individual nerve cell, or perhaps a specific
response by the central nervous system to counteract the sedating
effects and maintain normal function. Learning factors often
appear to play an important role in changing the individual's
response to a drug after experience with it. Effects which
initially may be strange or frightening may later be accepted
without reaction or concern, or perhaps, even be desired. There
is evidence that people may learn to control some drug effects,
or otherwise come to function normally in the presence of certain
responses which might originally have been distracting, or
otherwise disrupting of behaviour. </p>

<p>A phenomenon often referred to as 'reverse tolerance' has been
noted with some drugs (notably the psychedelics) in which the
desired effects may be achieved with smaller doses after
experience with the drug. Both learning and pharmacological
mechanisms have been suggested to underly this process. </p>

<p>In many instances, after an individual becomes tolerant to the
effects of one drug, he will also show tolerance to others with
similar action. This is called <i>cross-tolerance. </i>For
example, a heavy drinker will normally show a reduced response to
barbiturates, tranquillizers and anaesthetics, as well as to
alcohol. </p>

<p>39.<i> Physical dependence is a physiological state of
adaptation to a</i><b> </b><i>drug, normally following the
development of tolerance, which results in a characteristic set
of withdrawal symptoms (often called the 'abstinence syndrome'),
when administration of the drug is stopped. </i>These symptoms
may be of an intense nature after persistent heavy use, and with
some sedatives and opiate narcotics, may include tremors,
vomiting, delirium, cramps and, in severe cases with some drugs,
convulsions and death. There are generally no overt signs of
physical dependence if the drug level is kept high enough to
avoid the withdrawal syndrome. In a sense, the body comes to
depend on the drug for 'normal' functioning after adapting to its
presence, and when the drug is absent, considerable disruption of
essential physiological processes occurs until readjustment
develops. The withdrawal syndrome may also he elicited without
abstinence, by the administration of a substance which
specifically antagonizes or blocks certain effects of the
original drug. </p>

<p>Withdrawal symptoms can be prevented or promptly relieved by
the administration of a sufficient quantity of the original drug
or one with similar pharmacological activity. The latter case, in
which different drugs can be used interchangeably in preventing
withdrawal symptoms, is called <i>cross-dependence. </i>As an
example, barbiturates and tranquillizers can be used in treating
the abstinence syndrome associated with chronic alcoholism. </p>

<p>Often the recovery phase associated with different drugs is<i>
</i>characterized by a rebound phenomenon dominated by activity
opposite to that produced by the drug. For instance, withdrawal
from the sedatives generally results in symptoms of acute and
toxic hyperactivation and physiological arousal, while the
pattern following intense stimulant (e.g. 'speed') use usually
involves sedation, depression and sleep. </p>

<p>Although physical dependence can develop with such common
drugs as alcohol and barbiturates, it is not a factor in the
drug-taking behaviour of the vast majority of regular users. In
the few individuals who become physically dependent on these
particular drugs, serious social, personal and physiological
consequences of drug use usually precede the physical dependence.
Therefore, although physical dependence is a serious medical
problem in a minority of sedative users, the abstinence syndrome
itself is not the cause of major public health problems. The
potent opiate narcotics, by contrast, tend to produce very
pronounced tolerance and physical dependence early in the history
of regular use. These features then soon become an integral part
of the particular drug problem presented by the opiate narcotics.
However, with these and other drugs, psychological factors in the
dependence are often more significant in the long run. </p>

<p><i>40. Psychological dependence </i>(also often called
behavioural, psychic or emotional dependence, and habituation) is
a much more elusive concept and is difficult to define in a
satisfactory manner. A World Health Organization paper69 defines
psychic dependence thus: 'In this situation there is a feeling of
satisfaction and a psychic drive that require periodic or
continuous administration of the drug to produce a desired effect
or to avoid discomfort.' A major problem with this definition is
the difficulty in operationally defining and objectively
identifying the characteristics of the dependence in a practical
situation. </p>

<p>By contrast, some scientists224 have identified behavioural
dependence as repeated self-administration of a drug. This
approach seems far too broad for most purposes since it only
indicates that the drug is in some way reinforcing or rewarding
to the user, and merely restates the observation that he takes
the drug. </p>

<p>Extreme instances of psychological dependence are easier to
identify and may be characterized by an intense craving for, or
compulsion to continue the use of, a drug with obvious
behavioural manifestations. In many instances, psychological
aspects may be considerably more important than physical
dependence in maintaining chronic drug use. The major problem
with opiate dependence is not the physical aspects, since
withdrawal can be successfully achieved in a few weeks, but the
great likelihood that the individual will later return to chronic
use due to psychological dependence. </p>

<p>In most instances of even regular non-medical use of drugs,
such intense psychological dependence probably does not occur.
However, more subtle psychological and social factors usually
have persisting effects in maintaining the behaviour of drug
consumption. </p>

<p>In talking about dependency in any context, whether dealing
with drugs or not, it would seem useful to specify what it is
that is being depended upon and for what reasons, and to identify
the consequences of its presence or its absence. The significance
of dependency changes considerably if the entity is relied upon,
for example, for the maintenance of life (e.g., insulin for the
diabetic) or for the escape from an unpleasant or intolerable
situation (e.g., privacy), or perhaps for a feeling of well-being
or satisfaction with life. In one sense psychological dependence
may be said to exist with respect to anything which is part of
one's preferred way of life. In our society, this kind of
dependency occurs regularly with respect to such things as
television, music, books, religion, sex, money, favourite foods,
certain drugs, hobbies, sports or games and, often, other
persons. Some degree of psychological dependence is, in this
sense, a general and normal psychological condition. </p>

<p>A statement in the preliminary brief of the Addiction Research
Foundation of Ontario reflects the complexity of interpreting the
question of dependency:4 </p>

<p>It should be recognized, however, that dependence is not
necessarily bad in itself, either for the individual or for
society. The question to he evaluated, therefore, is not whether
dependence can occur, but whether dependence in a given case
results in physical, psychological or social harm. </p>

<p><i>41. The concept of addiction. </i>The term 'addiction' has
had a variety of meanings, and a consensus as to the proper
definition seems unlikely, even in scientific circles. Often it
has been used interchangeably with dependence (psychological
and/or physiological), while at other times it appears to be
synonymous with the term 'drug abuse'. The classical model of the
addiction- producing drug was based on the opiate narcotics, and
has traditionally required the presence of tolerance, and
physical and psychological dependence. However, this approach has
not been generally satisfactory since only a few commonly used
drugs (e.g., alcohol and other sedatives), in addition to the
opiates, seem to fit the model at all. It is clearly
inappropriate for many other drugs which can cause serious
dependency problems. For example, amphetamines can produce
considerable tolerance and strong psychological dependence with
little or no physical dependence, and cocaine can produce
psychological dependence without tolerance or physical
dependence. Furthermore, in certain medical applications,
morphine has been reported to produce tolerance and physical
dependence without a significant psychological component. </p>

<p>Recognizing the problems with the concept of addiction, the
World Health Organization (WHO) proposed the following:69 </p>

<p>It has become impossible in practice, and is scientifically
unsound, to maintain a single definition for all forms of drug
addiction and/or habituation. A feature common to these
conditions as well as to drug abuse in general is dependence,
psychic or physical or both, of the individual on a chemical
agent. Therefore, better understanding should be attained by
substitution of the term drug dependence of this or that type,
according to the agent or class of agents involved.... It must be
emphasized that drug dependence is a general term that has been
selected for its applicability to all types of drug abuse and
thus carries no connotation of the degree of risk to public
health or need for any or a particular type of drug control. </p>

<p>The WHO committee presented short descriptions of various
different types of drug dependence which may occur<b> </b>in some
individuals and situations. The list identifies drug dependence
of the morphine type, the barbiturate - alcohol type, the cocaine
type, the cannabis (marijuana) type, the amphetamine type, the
khat type, and the hallucinogen (LSD) type. Details of<b> </b>these
various kinds of drug dependence are discussed separately later
in this chapter. </p>

<p>For reasons analogous to those presented above, it is further
suggested here that the term dependent rather than the ambiguous
description 'addict' be used to refer to aft individual who has
developed drug dependence of either the physical or psychological
forms. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Scientific
Methods </h3>

<p>42<i>. The role of statistics. </i>Statistics can be helpful
in collecting and handling numerical or quantified information,
interpreting data, and making inferences or generalizations from
it. The simplest use of statistics is to describe or summarize
certain abstract characteristics of a group or sample. For
example, the average height of players on a basketball team
provides a shorthand description of the group. The numerical mean
is a common index of the average. Considerably more information
could be communicated if some idea of the variability of heights
within the team were known. The range of measures, for example,
is a crude index of the variance of 'spread' in the distribution
within a group. </p>

<p>A second function of statistics is to provide a system for
inference about some population on the basis of a smaller group
or sample selected from that population. For example, the mean
I.Q. of a group of 50 students randomly selected from a school
with 500 individuals might provide a reasonable estimate of the
average intelligence of the entire student population of that
school. The success of such generalization or extrapolation
depends on the relative size of the sample and the accuracy or
fidelity with which the group studied represents the overall
population of interest. Any bias in sampling which reduces the
similarity between the selected group and the population to which
the results are to be generalized reduces the validity of such
extrapolation. </p>

<p>Statistics may also assist in distinguishing between the
differences in measurements resulting from random variation and
the variance due to the factor which is being studied. By
obtaining an estimate of the natural variability in a population,
it may be possible to distinguish, with some confidence, between
a 'real effect' associated with a particular condition or
treatment, and the difference which might be expected by chance
alone. The phrase 'statistically significant' is used to indicate
an effect considered significantly greater than that likely due
to chance. </p>

<p>However, statistical techniques alone can only indicate an
association between different variables and can not actually
identify cause and effect. Such causal inferences must be based
on an overall consideration of the research design. In many
laboratory experiments, the stimulus and its response may be
readily identified, but in less tightly controlled social studies
(e.g., surveys) and clinical observations, it is often very
difficult or impossible to positively identify the causal
variable in a complex pattern of associations among different
characteristics of the sample. For example, the demonstration
that persons who are heavy users of tranquillizers also tend to
be regular alcohol drinkers does not necessarily indicate that
one causes the other. It may well be that a third factor (e.g.,
the desire to avoid or<i> </i>escape anxiety and tension) may be
responsible for both behaviours. Interpretation of the data
generally requires considerations beyond that involved in the
statistical analysis. </p>

<p>43. <i>Experimental methods. </i>Details of research design
would not be appropriate here, although some simple notions as to
elementary requirements for adequate experimental techniques in
psychopharmacology may be worthwhile. A major goal of scientific
research is to eliminate or control all factors, other than those
to be studied, which can influence or bias measurement. </p>

<p>As discussed above, the subjects of the study must be
sufficiently similar to the general population of ultimate
interest to allow generalization from the data. Extrapolation
from one animal species to another, from one human society to
another, or from one social group<b> </b>to another is often
quite tenuous and must be viewed with extreme caution. Variables
such as age, sex, and social class often exert considerable
influence on psychological measures, and must be taken into
careful consideration. </p>

<p>Unless there is some reason why a particular dose level is of <i>singular
</i>significance, more than one dose should be studied. If the
purpose of the experiment is to allow inferences of a general
social nature, then the dose, mode of administration and the
general circumstances of the study must be relevant to the
pattern of use in the general population. </p>

<p>In order to determine the effect of a particular treatment, it
is necessary to have a reference or control condition for
comparison, which has been treated identically to the
experimental condition except for the factor under analysis.
These data may be obtained from a separate group of control
subjects, which is sufficiently similar to the experimental
group, or from the same subjects studied at a different time. Due
to the great variation between individuals in response to drugs,
the latter approach is often most efficient, although it is
sometimes inappropriate or impractical. Using subjects as their
own controls requires special statistical techniques for handling
the data, since repeated experience in the situation will affect
the subject's subsequent performance through such mechanisms as
general adaptation, practice and other learning variables, and
often fatigue. </p>

<p>Care must be taken to control or eliminate the possible
effects of the subject's and researcher's expectations and
biases. Since set and setting play an important role in
determining drug effects, an inactive placebo substance should be
tested in a control situation under conditions which are
identical to those present when the drug is studied. Sometimes,
however, if the subject has had previous experience with the
experimental drug, he may soon realize whether he was given the
active drug or an inactive substance despite his initial lack of
information, and consequently the placebo control may not be
complete. An experimental design in which the subject is not
informed as to which treatment is being investigated is called a <i>single-blind
</i>study. </p>

<p>Since the scientist's bias and expectations can also influence
the subject's performance and the interpretation of his behaviour
(as well as the later data analysis), the validity of the
measurements can often be further increased it the researcher is
also unaware of which treatment condition is in effect at the
time of the experiment. A study in which neither the subject nor
the researcher knows which of the experimental treatment
variables are operating is called a <i>double-blind </i>design.
There are certain circumstances where a double-blind is
inappropriate or impossible, although it is often the most
efficient way to acquire specific information about drug effects
in an experimental situation. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">A
Review of Selected Drugs </h3>

<p>44. The remainder of this chapter is devoted to a short
critical review of the scientific literature pertaining to the
effects of certain psychoactive drugs. Barbiturates, alcohol,
minor tranquillizers, amphetamines, LSD, cannabis, opiate
narcotics, and volatile solvents are discussed. In these interim
reviews an attempt has been made to concentrate on human
psychopharmacological studies rather than on animal experiments
or general social reports. Although original scientific sources
were sought and used as<b> </b>often as possible, it was
frequently necessary at this interim stage to rely on reviews
prepared by others. </p>

<p>There has been no attempt to be exhaustive in the references

<h2>CHAPTER ONE </h2>

<h2>THE COMMISSION'S INTERPRETATION OF ITS TASK </h2>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Background of the Commission's Appointment </h3>

<p>1. The Commission of Inquiry into the Non-Medical Use of Drugs
was appointed by the Government of Canada under Part I of the
Inquiries Act on May 29, 1969, on the recommendation of the
Honourable John Munro, Minister of National Health and Welfare. </p>

<p>The concern that gave rise to the appointment of the
Commission is described in Order-in-Council P.C. 1969-1112, which
authorized the appointment, in the following terms: </p>

<p>The Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a
report from the Minister of National Health and Welfare,
representing: </p>

<p>'That there is growing concern in Canada about the non-medical
use of certain drugs and substances, particularly, those having
sedative, stimulant, tranquillizing or hallucinogenic properties,
and the effect of such use on the individual and the social
implications thereof; </p>

<p>That within recent years, there has developed also the
practice of inhaling the fumes of certain solvents having an
hallucinogenic effect, and resulting in serious physical damage
and a number of deaths, such solvents being found in certain
household substances. Despite warnings and considerable
publicity, this practice has developed among young people and can
be said to be related to the use of drugs for other than medical
purposes; </p>

<p>That certain of these drugs and substances including lysergic
acid diethylamide, LSD, methamphetamines, commonly referred to as
'Speed', and certain others, have been made the subject of
controlling or prohibiting legislation under the Food and Drugs
Act, and cannabis, marijuana, has been a substance, the
possession of or trafficking in which has been prohibited under
the Narcotic Control Act; </p>

<p>That notwithstanding these measures and the competent
enforcement thereof by the R.C.M. Police and other enforcement
bodies, the incidence of possession and use of these substances
for non-medical purposes has increased and the need for an
investigation as to the cause of such increasing use has become
imperative. </p>

<p>During the year or so preceding the appointment of the
Commission, members of parliament had called for an inquiry into
the use of drugs. One member spoke of 'the galloping increase in
the use of marijuana and the increasing number of young people
tragically being paraded daily before the courts' and of 'the
extreme urgency of dealing properly with these cases'. In
announcing the Government's intention to appoint the Commission,
the Minister of National Health and Welfare spoke of 'the grave
concern felt by the Government at the expanding proportions of
the use of drugs and related substances for non-medical
purposes'. </p>

<h3>The Commission's Terms of Reference </h3>

<p>3. The Order-in-Council authorizing the appointment of the
Commission sets out its terms of reference as follows; </p>

<p>That inquiry be made into and concerning the factors
underlying or relating to the non-medical use of the drugs and
substances above described and that for this purpose a Commission
of Inquiry be established, constituted and with authority as
hereinafter provided. </p>

<p>(a) to marshal from available sources, both in Canada and
abroad, data and information comprising the present fund of
knowledge concerning the non-medical use of sedative, stimulant,
tranquillizing, hallucinogenic and other psychotropic drugs or
substances; </p>

<p><i>(b) </i>to report on the current state of medical knowledge
respecting the effect of the drugs and substances referred to in
(a); </p>

<p><i>(c)</i> to inquire into and report on the motivation
underlying the non-medical use referred to in (a); </p>

<p><i>(d)</i> <i>to inquire into and report on the social,
economic, edu</i>cational and philosophical factors relating to
the use for non-medical purposes of the drugs and substances
referred to in (a) and in particular, on the extent of the
phenomenon, the social factors that had led to it, the age groups
involved, and problems of communication; and </p>

<p><i>(e)</i> <i>to inquire into and recommend with respect to
the ways </i>or means by which the Federal Government can act,
alone or in its relations with Government at other levels, in the
reduction of the dimensions of the problems involved in such use.
</p>

<h3>The Implications of the Terms of Reference </h3>

<p>4. While the Commission's terms of reference make specific
mention of the sedative, stimulant, tranquillizing and
hallucinogenic drugs, they also require inquiry concerning other
psychotropic drugs and substances. <i>The Commission understands
drug to mean any substance that by its chemical nature</i><b> </b><i>alters
structure or function in the living organism. The psychotropic
drugs are those drugs which alter sensation, mood, consciousness
or other psychological or behavioural functions. </i>These
concepts are further clarified in Chapter Two<b> </b>of this
report. A number of classifications of psychotropic drugs have
been brought to the Commission's attention. Chapter Two presents
the classification that has been accepted by the Commission. It
also contains a detailed account of the psychotropic properties
and medical and non-medical uses of certain of the drugs causing
the greatest public concern. It is clear to the Commission that
it would not be appropriate to confine its attention to the
so-called 'soft drugs' such as marijuana, hashish and LSD. The
'hard drugs' such as the opiate narcotics, of which heroin is an
example, have marked psychotropic effects. The amphetamines or
'speed' drugs which are popularly considered as hard drugs appear
to be increasing in their non-medical use. Moreover, both the
structure of present Canadian drug laws and the nature of the
drug controversy make it impossible to consider the 'soft drugs'
without reference to the amphetamines and the opiates. Indeed,
the opiate narcotics have been and are an important reference
point in, establishing the public perspective for the non-medical
use of many other drugs. The Commission believes that it has
properly focused its primary attention in the initial phase of
its inquiry on the non-medical use of drugs such as cannabis, LSD
and amphetamines by young people. However, we have had a growing
concern for the facts and implications of the use of drugs such
as alcohol and tobacco by people of all ages. These two drugs,
both of which are psychotropic, remain the most popular drugs in
non-medical use among both young people and adults. Adults
generally seem unwilling to accept the fact that alcohol and
tobacco are drugs, and often find it difficult to view the
non-medical drug use of youth with reference to and in the
context of the socially acceptable use of drugs by adults. </p>

<p>5. Two broad categories in which the use of psychotropic drugs
can be classified are: (a) medical and non-medical use, and (b)
legal and illegal use. While the distinction between legal and
illegal use is simple and derives directly from the law, it is
difficult to find a satisfactory definition of medical and
non-medical drug use. <i>Medical use of drugs is taken</i> <i>by
the Commission to be use which is indicated for generally
accepted medical reasons, whether under medical supervision or
not; all drug use which is not indicated on generally accepted
medical grounds is considered to be non-medical use. </i>Thus,
the occasional use of aspirin to control the pain of an ordinary
headache is considered to be medical use, while the dependent use
of large quantities of barbiturates obtained through one or more
prescriptions is not. Clearly, non-medical use is not to be
equated with illegal use. The use of alcohol by adults is
generally non-medical but it is legal, whereas the use of
marijuana is both non-medical and illegal. </p>

<p>6. The commission is invited to marshal the present fund of
world knowledge concerning the non-medical use of psychotropic
drugs and substances. Taken literally, this task is impossible,
with the time and resources available to the Commission. The
world literature on all the psychotropic drugs and substances is
very extensive. There are over 40,000 items on alcohol alone at
Rutgers University, a major centre of alcohol studies. There are
estimated to be over 2,000 items on cannabis. Experts in the
field have testified to the extreme difficulty of keeping abreast
of the literature, particularly because of its multi-disciplinary
character. There are only a few sources of comprehensive
information on this continent: the Addiction Research Foundation
of Ontario is by far the best equipped in this country; the
National Institute of Mental Health in the United States provides
a computerized data retrieval service. In Geneva, the World
Health Organization of the United Nations possesses extensive
bibliographical resources. </p>

<p>Collecting the available data and information is only one
stage. It is also necessary to establish and apply criteria of
scientific validity to such data and information. In many
instances, the Commission is obliged to rely heavily on the work
of experts who have themselves sifted and critically evaluated
the available literature. It must form its judgements on the
basis of the materials which they have identified as most
relevant and reliable. The Commission cannot carry out a
comprehensive bibliographical work for the whole range of
psychotropic drugs and substances. It must try to seize upon the
essentials in the present fund of knowledge as they bear upon the
areas of concern and the issues in this inquiry. </p>

<p>7. The Commission is required to report on the current state
of medical knowledge concerning the effect of psychotropic drugs
and substances. This it has attempted to do in an interim
fashion, in Chapter Two, entitled 'The Drugs and Their Effects'.
The effects contemplated by paragraph (b) in the terms of
reference are presumably the physiological and psychological
ones, including their behavioural manifestations. The term
'medical' is rather too narrow as a reference to the expertise
which is in the determination of drug effects since these are a
complex result of many factors, including the expectation of the
user and the social setting in which the drug is taken. In its
interim brief to the Commission, the Canadian Medical Association
stressed the multi-disciplinary character of the study required
for a proper understanding of non-medical drug use. We have,
therefore, interpreted the word 'medical' to refer broadly to all
scientific knowledge concerning the effects of drug use. The
language of paragraph (b) of the terms of reference suggests that
it was not intended that the Commission would itself undertake
original research into the effects of non-medical drug use.
Although we do not exclude the possibility of some clinical or
experimental work, particularly with respect to the effect of
certain drugs on psychomotor functions, it is our opinion that
with the time and resources at our disposal, and having regard to
the research currently being conducted by such organizations as
the Addiction Research Foundation and the National Institute of
Mental Health, we should confine ourselves to carrying out a
critical review of the existing knowledge and ongoing research,
as well as attempting to identify research priorities and the
role which the federal government can play in relation to
research. </p>

<p>8. The remaining paragraphs in the terms of reference deal
with the extent and the causes of non-medical drug use. They
reflect a broad concern to understand the reasons for the
increase in such use. They invite the Commission to attempt to
place this phenomenon in a proper social and philosophic context.
We cannot help feeling that this is one of the most important
aspects of our task: one on which there is a compelling need for
an understanding of current Canadian attitudes. This is implied
by the allusion in paragraph (d) of the terms of reference to
'problems of communication'. To understand the factors underlying
non-medical drug use and the problems for which government action
may be indicated, it is necessary to consider not only the
effects, extent, and causes of such use, but the range of social
response and attitude which such use has elicited from
government, other institutions and individuals. For non-medical
drug use and the social response to it are interacting and
mutually conditioning phenomena. </p>

<h3>Methods of Inquiry </h3>

<p>9. The Commission has used a variety of methods of inquiry.
Because of the profound social significance of the non-medical
drug use phenomenon and of the importance of personal and public
attitudes to it, the Commission decided early to conduct public
hearings in all of the provinces. It has attached particular
important to these hearings. They have been used to foster the
widest possible public discussion. In order to encourage the
participation of young people, it was decided to hold some of the
public hearings in more informal settings than may have been
customary for such commissions in the past. In addition to the
public hearings, the Commissioners have collectively and
individually held numerous private hearings, have consulted with
experts in several fields related to non-medical drug use, and
have read extensively in the scientific and legal literature. The
Commission has also received many communications, written and
oral, from Canadians in all walks of life. </p>

<p>10. At the beginning of September, 1969, the Commission wrote
to over 750 individuals and organizations inviting them to submit
briefs or to make oral submissions. In particular, the Commission
solicited briefs from: federal and provincial government
departments; law enforcement authorities, educational
institutions and associations; members of university faculties
and departments; medical and pharmaceutical institutions and
associations, addiction research foundations; street clinics and
other innovative services; correctional and welfare
organizations; bar associations; youth organizations; student
organizations; and a wide variety of other organizations and
individuals having an evident concern or point of contact with
the phenomenon of non-medical drug use in Canada. The Commission
received a gratifying response to this invitation, and despite
the relatively short time available in some cases for the
preparation of briefs, individuals and organizations made a very
commendable effort to prepare submissions for the public hearings
which began in the middle of October. </p>

<p>11. A list of the organizations and individuals who have been
identified with submissions to the Commission in the initial
phase of this inquiry is contained in Appendix A to this report,
Fifty-five organizations have been represented at the public
hearings at which they have submitted written briefs; twenty have
been represented by oral submissions; forty-five have made
written submissions to the Commission without appearing at a
public hearing. Thirty two individuals have submitted written
briefs and 45 others have made oral submissions at public
hearings. In addition, there have been numerous oral submissions
and interventions by members of the public who have attended the
hearings. The Commission has also received several hundred
letters from individuals, and a selection of these letters or
excerpts from them is included in the Report as Appendix B. We
emphasize that this selection is not intended to convey the
weight of opinion in this correspondence, but simply to reflect
something of the range of response. </p>

<p>12. In the initial phase of this inquiry, the Commission has
held public hearings in the following centres: Toronto - October
16, 17 and 18; Vancouver - October 30 and 31; Victoria - November
1; Montreal - November 6, 7 and 8; Winnipeg - November 13 and 14;
Ottawa - December 12 and 13; Halifax - January 29 and 30; St.
John's - January 31; Fredericton - February 19; Moncton -
February 20; Sackville - February 20; and Charlottetown -
February 21; Kingston - March 5. </p>

<p>A special word may be appropriate concerning the nature of the
public hearings. They have been conducted in a rather informal
manner. There has been a considerable degree of audience
participation. People have felt free to comment on formal
submissions, and there has been a great deal of informal exchange
among persons attending the hearings. On the whole, response to
this style of hearing has been favourable, although there has
been some criticism from one or two organizations who have
expressed the opinion that we should not have permitted questions
and critical comments from members of the public. Because of the
nature of the phenomenon which it is required to investigate, the
Commission is convinced that it has been essential to attempt to
establish a true public forum for discussion<i> </i>of the
issues. Most organizations have reacted favourably to this kind
of inquiry. In addition to the more traditional settings of
hotels and public buildings, the Commission has held public
hearings at universities and from time to time in coffee houses
that have become centres of the new youth culture. </p>

<p>Informal hearings have been held in the following
universities: York University; the University of Toronto; the
University of British Columbia; the University of Montreal;
McGill University; Sir George Williams University; the University
of Manitoba; the University of Winnipeg; the University of
Ottawa; Carleton University; Dalhousie University; Memorial
University; the University of New Brunswick; the University of
Moncton; Mount Allison University; the University of Prince
Edward Island; and in the following coffee houses: 'The Penny
Farthing' in Yorkville, Toronto; 'The Bistro' in Vancouver, and
the 'Back Door' in Montreal. </p>

<p>The hearings in these more informal settings have given the
Commission direct and vivid contact with the opinions and
attitudes of young people in Canada. All the Commission hearings
have been recorded on tape, and in addition there has been a
stenographic record. In many ways it is a matter of regret that
an audio-visual record could not have been made, but the nature
of the subject matter is such that the Commission felt obliged to
protect individuals appearing before it from undue publicity. The
media have cooperated with the Commission in respecting its
request that members of the public should not be photographed
while making submissions. In many cases, the submissions have
been of a highly personal nature, and the hearings would have
been much inhibited if they had been photographed. At the same
time, the Commission has been intensely aware of the fact that it
was listening to an unusual social commentary. Opinions and
feelings have poured forth in the hearings with great
spontaneity, particularly in the more informal settings. The
Commission has been deeply impressed, and on several occasions,
moved by the testimony which it has heard. It has been struck by
the depth of feeling which this phenomenon and the social
response to it have aroused. As a result of the initial phase of
its inquiry, the Commission is more than ever convinced that the
proper response to the non-medical use of psychotropic drugs is a
question which must be worked out by the people of Canada,
examining it and talking it over together. It goes to the roots
of our society and touches the values underlying our whole
approach to life. It is not a matter which can be confined to the
discrete consultation of experts, although experts obviously have
their role, and a very important one, to play. </p>

<p>13. A word should be said about the protection of witnesses.
The terms of reference of the Commission empower it to take
testimony in such manner as to safeguard the anonymity of
witnesses. The Order-in-Council authorizing the appointment of
the Commission provides: </p>

<p>That the said Commissioners may, if they deem the same
expedient, cause a record to be made of the evidence which shall
be given or produced before them, or any part of that evidence,
as to the matters to be inquired into and reported upon and may
direct that the oral evidence of witnesses, before them, or any
such witness, shall be taken in shorthand by a shorthand writer,
approved and sworn by the said Commissioners or one of them, and
may direct that the oral evidence of any such witness may be so
given and recorded, whether under oath or otherwise, without a
disclosure of the identity of that witness, and that any evidence
so recorded shall be certified by the person or persons taking
the same in shorthand, as correct. </p>

<p>The notices which the Commission has published of its hearings
have given prominence to this readiness to take evidence given
privately and anonymously, and many witnesses have availed
themselves of this opportunity. The Commission has also received
a number of anonymous submissions through the mail. At the same
time, concern has been expressed from time to time that the
public hearings might be used for law enforcement purposes. As a
result of an understanding at the outset of this inquiry with the
officers of the R.C.M.P., the Commission has been able to assure
the public that its hearings would not be exploited for law
enforcement purposes. It has every reason to believe that this
understanding has been respected. Although there have been
rumours from time to time that law enforcement personnel have
taken advantage of the hearings for purposes of investigation, no
evidence of this has been brought to the attention of the
Commission, despite public statements by the Chairman that any
such instances should be reported to him. </p>

<p>The Commission has been very impressed by the candour with
which people of all ages have come forward and spoken from a
depth of conviction, and feeling about the phenomenon of
non-medical drug usage and its relation to other aspects of
social and cultural change today. </p>

<p>14. Altogether, it is estimated that nearly 12,000 Canadians
have attended the hearings up to the end of February. The
Commissioners have travelled some 17,000 miles, and in the months
ahead they will continue to move back and forth across the
country until every province and major city have been visited, as
well as many of the smaller communities. </p>

<p>15. The Commission has had the benefit of a wide range of
advice from experts in the field of non-medical drug use. It is
only possible here to mention some of those who were particularly
helpful. </p>

<p>The Commission has had several sessions with officers of the
R.C.M.P, and has received the fullest cooperation from the Force
in its attempt to understand the lessons of law enforcement in
this field. In addition to the public submission of the Force,
each Division prepared a brief, and the Commission has had the
advantage of private hearings with officers from each Division.
Moreover, research consultants of the Commission have been
permitted to observe law enforcement by the Force at first hand.
The Commission has also received a number of written
communications from the Force in addition to its formal
submissions. We can not speak too highly of the cooperation that
we have received from the R.C.M.P., who went to particular
trouble, on relatively short notice in the initial stages of the
inquiry, to give the Commission the benefit of their experience.
Whatever view one may take of law enforcement policy in this
controversial field, we feel obliged to record our respect for
the highly professional manner in which the R.C.M.P. have sought
to per-form their duty in relation to this inquiry. We look
forward to their continued cooperation as we deepen our study of
the problems of law enforcement and the administration of justice
in the field of non-medical drug use. </p>

<p>The Commission has also received a great deal of valuable
assistance from addiction foundations, notably the Addiction
Research Foundation of Ontario, the Narcotic Addiction Foundation
of British Columbia, and OPTAT (Office de la Prevention et du
Traitement de l'Alcoolisme et des Autres Toxicomanies). From the
outset of its inquiry the Commission has had the benefit of
frequent consultation with members of the Ontario Foundation, and
the Commission's research staff have made extensive use of the
bibliographical and documentary resources of the Foundation. </p>

<p>The Commission has also consulted with many other experts, in
Canada and the United States. It plans to consult with many more,
including experts outside North America, in the ensuing year. For
the present, it would like to make special mention of the
assistance which it has received from Dr J. Robertson Unwin, Dr
Lionel Solursh and Mr Wilfred Clement, whose intimate knowledge
of the Canadian drug scene from a scientific, yet deeply human
perspective, has made their observations and advice invaluable.
The Commission should also record its indebtedness for advice
received in the early stages of the inquiry from Dr Helen Nowlis
of the University of Rochester, Samuel Pearlman of the City
University of New York, Dr Daniel Glaser of the New York State
Narcotic Addiction Control Commission; members of the National
Institute of Mental Health, and Department of Justice in the
United States. </p>

<h3>The Role of the Interim Report </h3>

<p>16. We have had some difficulty in determining what should be
the role of our interim report. In particular, we have been
somewhat perplexed as to how far we are justified in coming to
conclusions and making recommendations at this time. But we are
required by our terms of reference to render an interim report,
and we assume that something more is expected than a simple
report of progress. We believe that what is expected, at the very
least, is a report, which conveys our initial understanding of
the subject matter of the inquiry and makes such recommendations
as we feel are urgent and for which we believe we have a
sufficient basis at this time. We hope it will serve to put the
phenomenon of non-medical drug use in some perspective, to
identify the issues, and to provide the basis for further
consideration and discussion by the people of Canada. Further, by
identifying certain attitudes, hypotheses, and tentative
opinions, the interim report will serve, we hope, as a sounding
board, eliciting further evidence and opinion, and indicating to
us wherein our definition of the issues and our preliminary
opinions may require revision. </p>

<p>17. The function of the final report will be to complete the
picture begun by the interim report and to report upon the system
of social response which we recommend for the phenomenon of
non-medical drug use. The inquiry between the interim report and
the final report will test the definitions of issues and the
hypotheses reflected in the interim report, add necessary
information with respect to the effects, the extent, and the
causes of non-medical drug use, as well as the role played by the
various aspects of social control and response, and lay the
foundation for specific recommendations concerning these various
aspects. The interim report is primarily concerned with a
statement of the issues and applicable principles, and the final
report is to be concerned with the detailed application of these
principles to the development of a satisfactory system of social
response. </p>

<p>We recognize, however, that the urgency of some of the
problems involved in non-medical drug use and the time required
to develop adequate resources to cope with them may indicate the
appropriateness of certain recommendations at this time. This is
particularly true with respect to preparations and organization
for which considerable lead time is required. In such cases it
may be sufficient to indicate the general direction which certain
responses should take, leaving it to further study and
consultation in the ensuing year to settle matters of detail. </p>

<p>18. Chapter Two on the effect of the drugs is offered at this
time for two reasons. First, we have been profoundly impressed by
repeated assertions of the need for more reliable information,
and we hope that this chapter will serve a useful purpose as
material for drug education. Secondly, we feel that it is an
indispensable basis for the development of public understanding
of the issues. In effect, in Chapter Two we disclose our initial
assumptions concerning the effects of the drugs. Our </p>

<p>object is to identify the body of reliable and generally<b> </b>accepted
knowledge, and to determine where the important uncertainties and
gaps exist. We certainly concur in the impression which others
have conveyed of a field of knowledge bedevilled by controversy,
conflicting professional opinion, and uncertainty. Some observers
question whether it is possible, in view of the intense feelings
on this subject, ever to come to agreement on what should be
accepted as scientifically known. Erich Goode in his article,
'Marijuana and the Politics of Reality', observes that 'the
multitude of results from the many marijuana reports forms a sea
of ambiguity into which nearly any message may be read'. He makes
the point that whether a particular drug effect is good or bad
depends on one's subjective point of view - the implications of
the effect in term's of one's own system of values. Goode sees no
possible reconciliation of these <i>'</i>differential evaluations<i>
</i>of the same &quot;objective&quot; consequences', and he
concludes that 'the essential meaning of the marijuana issue is
the meaning which each individual brings to it'. The Addiction
Research Foundation of Ontario makes the same point in its
preliminary submission to the Commission. It puts the matter this
way: </p>

<p>However, after all possible information has been acquired and
verified scientifically, the final steps in the formulation of
legislation or governmental policy will be based upon value
judgements. Even the classification of the effects of drug use as
'beneficial' or 'adverse' is a process of evaluation with respect
to subjective standards. </p>

<p>The response to non-medical drug use is profoundly a matter of
attitudes. At the same time we must make every effort to
ascertain what should be accepted as scientific knowledge of the
'objective' effects. It is intolerable that the process of
subjective evaluation should take place in ignorance of the
objective facts. At the same, we would do well to heed Goode's
caution that there is an inevitable tendency to select and
emphasize those views of 'objective' facts which support our own
subjective evaluation. And as Goode points out, with special
reference to the La Guardia Report on marijuana, the various
findings can be used to support conflicting points of view. Are
we to conclude that the task is hopeless? We think not. We can
certainly make progress by attempting to identify what should be
accepted scientifically concerning the 'objective' effects, by
pointing out the important areas of scientific controversy or<b> </b>lack
of scientific knowledge, and by making explicit the value
judgements underlying the conflicting views as to how the effects
should be subjectively characterized. We believe it is helpful to
clarify the issues of the debate. </p>

<h3>Staff and Research </h3>

<p>19. The members of the Commission and their staff are listed
in Appendix C. The Commission is carrying out its task with a
small nucleus of full-time staff and with research consultants on
a part-time basis for special aspects of its study. The
Commission's Research Associates, Dr Charles Farmilo and Dr Ralph
D. Miller, are concentrating on<b> </b>psychopharmacological
research into the effects of the drugs. Dr Miller is the author,
with the assistance of Dr Farmilo, of Chapter Two on 'The Drugs
and Their Effects'. Research that has been commissioned so far
includes survey research to determine the extent and patterns of
non-medical drug use in Canada, as well as Canadian perceptions
of and attitudes towards this phenomenon, and legal studies, both
doctrinal and empirical, of the various problems involved in the
regulation of non-medical drug use. The section of Chapter Five
dealing with the law is based in part on preliminary work by
Professor Paul Weiler and John Hogarth. </p>

<p>Research is only part of the work that is involved in an
inquiry of this kind. Special mention should be made of the
administrative staff who have had to work under particular
pressure because of the requirement of an interim report,
impinging concurrently with the organization and conduct of the
public hearings. We would like to express our appreciation of the
work of Mr James J. Moore, Executive-Secretary of the Commission,
who has had the general direction of operations and who has also
participated in the writing of the report; Mr Jack Macbeth, who
has been of great assistance in the organization of hearings and
the preparation of the report; Mrs Vivian Luscombe who has
supervised the secretarial staff of the Commission; Mr C. William
Doylend, the Ottawa Office Manager, and other members of the
administrative, secretarial and research staff. <br>

<h3>BARBITURATES </h3>

<p> </p>

<p>45. The term 'barbiturate' generally refers to drugs which are
derivatives of barbituric acid. Barbital, the first drug of this
class to be synthesized, was introduced into medicine in Germany
in 1903. Barbiturates rapidly gained a wide usage as
tranquillizers, sedatives and hypnotics (sleep inducers) which
continues to this day. In the past half-century, over 2,000
different barbiturates have been synthesized, although less than
a dozen make up the bulk of current use. Among these are
amobarbital (Amytal*), pentobarbital (Nembutal*), phenobarbital
(Luminal*), and secobarbital (Seconal*). These drugs are
frequently referred to as 'barbs', 'nemmies', 'goof balls',
'yellow jackets', 'red devils', 'downers' or 'sleeping pills'. </p>

<p>The barbiturates are often classified by the duration of their
sedative or hypnotic action at a standard dose. Since the
similarities among these drugs exceed the differences, they will
be discussed in general terms as a group. </p>

<p>46. Barbiturates are among the most widely used psychoactive
drugs (medically and non-medically) in our society, and are the
toxic agents in thousands of accidental or intentional deaths
annually in North America. In addition, the barbiturates have
considerable potential for producing psychological and
physiological dependence, and are probably second only to alcohol
in frequency of drug-induced debilitation in modern society.
While a considerable body of research exists into the many
medical applications of these drugs, there has been relatively
little careful investigation of non-medical use. </p>

<p>Although the medical and non-medical use of barbiturates
appears to be widespread across age groups and social class, the
chronic use of these drugs, as with alcohol, seems to be
primarily an adult practice. Good epidemiological data in this
area are not available. Since prescription control is only
partially effective and possession of these drugs for personal
use without medical authorization is not a criminal offence and,
perhaps, because the users do not appear to form any homogeneous,
cohesive or easily recognized minority, the usual medical and law
enforcement statistics are of little assistance in assessing the
extent of non-medical use. </p>

<p>47. It has been frequently said that in Canada, the supply of
barbiturates lawfully manufactured or imported greatly exceeds
the requirements of legitimate medical use. It appears that many
current non-medical users were initiated into barbiturate use for
medical reasons. Numerous medical users develop dependence and
continue use long after the original medical purpose or
prescription is absent, and there are indications that most
chronic barbiturate users obtain the drugs through legitimate
channels.98 Since many physicians do not adequately maintain or
monitor prescription records, a patient may be able to arrange an
increase in the frequency and/or quantity of drug prescribed. In
addition, many chronic barbiturate<i> </i>(and other prescription
drug) users obtain 'legitimate' prescriptions from a number of
different doctors simultaneously, without the physicians'
awareness.79 Because of these patterns, the distinction between
medical and non-medical use of barbiturates is often particularly
difficult. Essentially all of the medical and non-medical
barbiturate supply in Canada is legitimately and professionally
manufactured; 'home-made' versions have not been identified. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Medical
Use </h3>

<p>48. Barbiturates are commonly used in medical practice today
and it would seem likely that many households have had first-hand
experience with them. Most of the medical uses are based on the
sedative, hypnotic, and anti-convulsant effects of the drugs.
Barbiturates are widely prescribed where a general depression of
nervous system activity is desired. In low doses, they are widely
used as day-time sedatives or tranquillizers. The hypnotic effect
of these drugs is familiar to thousands of Canadians who use
barbiturates in higher dose in the form of the common sleeping
pill. Barbiturates are also often administered alone, and in
conjunction with other drugs, as anaesthetics in surgical and
related medical situations; but they are poor analgesics if used
alone. The anti-convulsant effects of certain barbiturates have
been very important in the treatment of acute convulsions
associated with drug dependence withdrawal symptoms, various
neurological disorders (including epilepsy), and poisoning due to
the overdose of such stimulants as strychnine, nicotine and
cocaine. </p>

<p>Other medical applications include diagnosis and attempted
therapy of certain psychiatric disorders. In these instances the
drug is usually administered intravenously in a dose adjusted to
keep the patient in a semi-conscious state in which inhibitions
are reduced and various suppressed and emotionally charged
material may be released. This procedure is essentially that used
in the so-called 'truth serum' application in criminal
investigations. This effect, then, is really just a carefully
monitored dose-response to ordinary short-acting barbiturates
and, while this procedure frequently results in information
different from that communicated normally, there is little
evidence that it really exposes the 'truth' as such. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Administration,
Absorption, Distribution and Physiological Fate </h3>

<p>49. In crystalline form, barbiturates are odourless, white or
yellow powders, with a slightly bitter taste. They are available
as powders, elixirs, injections, suppositories, capsules or
tablets (both in sustained and delayed release forms). They are
frequently marketed for medical use in mixtures with other drugs,
such as other sedatives or tranquillizers, analgesics, belladonna
alkaloids (e.g., atropine or scopolamine), various stimulants
(e.g., amphetamine or caffeine), vitamins and various
gastrointestinal agents. </p>

<p>Barbiturates are usually administered orally for both medical
and non-medical purposes and are readily and efficiently absorbed
by the stomach, small intestine, and rectum. Absorption is more
rapid on an empty stomach than if the drug is taken immediately
after eating. Both intramuscular and intravenous injections are
also effective, but they are more prone to physiological
complication and are generally avoided except for special
purposes. While most chronic dependent users take barbiturates
orally, those who are experienced with self-injections (e.g.,
opiate narcotic or amphetamine dependents) may use the
intravenous route. </p>

<p>After absorption into the bloodstream, barbiturates are
initially distributed rather uniformly throughout the body, with
the latency of the psychological response being partly a function
of the facility of the particular drug in entering the brain. The
body eliminates barbiturate activity in several ways. Most
barbiturates are broken down or metabolized in the liver into
relatively inactive substances which are excreted by the kidney
in the urine, along with various quantities of the unaltered
drug. Temporary binding of drug molecules by plasma and tissue
protein soon after distribution, plus the affinity of certain
barbiturates for body tissue fats, may further shorten the
initial central nervous system (CNS) effects (and possibly
prolong other more subtle reactions). The preceding factors of
metabolism, excretion, and distribution are largely responsible
for the differences in potency and duration of action among the
different barbiturates. Acute and chronic barbiturate use can be
identified from blood and urine samples. 198 </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Psychological
Effects </h3>

<p>50. Many of the psychological and behavioural effects of<b> </b>hypnotic
doses of barbiturates are quite similar to the alcohol
inebriation syndrome and consequently do not need much
elaboration. While the drug user may be able to discriminate
between the alcohol and barbiturate states subjectively, it is
extremely difficult to tell the difference from the user's
behaviour. </p>

<p>Although high doses invariably produce behavioural sedation,
drowsiness, and sleep, the effects of mailer quantities may be
quite unpredictable. As with alcohol and other sedatives,
barbiturates may initially produce behavioural excitation,
stimulation and lack of inhibition (especially at low doses),
rather than sedation, depending on the situation and the
individual. In certain persons, sedation is not produced until a
considerable quantity has been administered, whereas other
psychological and behavioural effects may be quite pronounced.
The user may become happy, pleasant, euphoric or 'mellow' on one
extreme, or possibly hostile, suspicious, aggressive and violent
on the other. Emotional depression, self-pity, and withdrawal are
also not uncommon, and barbiturate-related suicides are
frequently reported. Although low-dose effects are often erratic,
moderate to high doses generally slow down reaction time, impair
complicated mental functions, and produce a lessening of
inhibition, a reduction in emotional control, and an impairment
of physical co-ordination as well as a variety of other effects
resembling alcohol inebriation. Acute toxic psychoses are rare.
The extreme variability in response, even within the same
individual over a short period of time, is illustrated by
Wikler's report.243 </p>

<p>After intravenous injection of 0.25 to 1.0gm of amobarbital, a
subject may fall asleep if he lies in bed undisturbed, yet he may
be awake and voluble if interviewed by a psychiatrist, or he may
exhibit ataxia on attempting to walk back to his bed, but he may
'sober up' promptly when instructed to pose for a motion picture
demonstration of ataxia. </p>

<p>51. Frequent mention is made of a phenomenon called 'drug
automatism', associated with toxic barbiturate overdose,
although, many observers have expressed doubts as to its
significance. In this situation, the individual, in a
drug-induced state of confusion or stupor, is said to administer
additional doses of the drug without being fully aware of the
previous administration.148 </p>

<p>52. Although it appears certain that driving skills would be
diminished by barbiturate intoxication, little direct
investigation has been conducted. Related behavioural studies do
suggest such an effect. Low therapeutic doses may not reduce
driving ability, however, if the drug is not taken in conjunction
with other sedatives such as alcohol.72 </p>

<p>53. On the basis of existing evidence it would appear that the
long-term psychological effects of moderate barbiturate use are
negligible for most users. Some of the complications of chronic
high-dose use will be dealt with later. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Physiological
Effects </h3>

<p>54. The short-term effect of moderate to high doses of
barbiturates is a general depression of neural and muscular
activity. As with psychological and behavioural effects, the
response to low dose is much more variable. Initially, the
electroencephalogram (EEG) may suggest cortical activation,
although this pattern is usually soon replaced by signs of
drowsiness or sleep. The sleep induced by hypnotic doses
generally resembles normal sleep with the exception of a marked
reduction in the rapid eye movement (REM) stage, the significance
of which is only beginning to be understood. Drowsiness or
'hangover' symptoms may follow acute intoxication or drug-induced
sleep. Although the sedative action of the barbiturates has
frequently been attributed to their effects on the reticular
activating system of the brain, little is known of the specific
details, and this action might occur through a variety of
different pharmacological mechanisms. </p>

<p>A variety of other transient or temporary physiological
changes may occur with moderate barbiturate use; the majority of
these apparently reflect a general 'slowing down' of
physiological activity (in the respiratory, cardiovascular and
other systems) normally occurring with behavioural sedation, and
are of little clinical significance. After even chronic
non-medical use there is generally a fairly complete recovery of
psychological and physiological capabilities following withdrawal
instances of permanent psychological or neurological disorder, or
of irreversible liver or kidney damage are rarely reported. This
is a rather surprising picture in light of the vast number of
disabilities attributed to chronic alcoholism and the general
pharmacological similarities between alcohol and the
barbiturates. It may be significant to note here that persons
physically dependent on barbiturates seem to be more likely to
maintain a reasonable state of nutrition than do chronic
alcoholics. </p>

<p>The toxic or poisoned state induced by barbiturate over-dose
is characterized by coma, a general shock syndrome (e.g., weak
rapid pulse, low blood pressure and cold sweaty skin) and may
result in death due to respiratory arrest, cardiovascular
collapse or kidney failure. If the over-dose is not fatal, a
temporary jaundice due to impaired liver function is likely to
follow and skin reactions may result. Some of these responses
will also occur to normal doses in individuals allergic to or
abnormally sensitive to the barbiturates. Because of the well
documented additive or potentiating effects (as well as
cross-tolerance) among the sedatives, users of related drugs,
such as alcohol, must be especially attentive to dose levels. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Tolerance
and Dependence </h3>

<p>55. Tolerance to some of the effects of barbiturates can be
demonstrated, although the degree and rate of tolerance
acquisition varies considerably with the dose, frequency of
administration and the individual. The potential for tolerance is
much lower with barbiturates than with the opiate narcotics, and
appears to level off at a maximum of 1.0 - 2.5gm. per day. (A
normal sleep-inducing dose might be around 0.1 - 0.3gm.) While
this loss of drug sensitivity is quite general and applies to
both sedative and mood effects, no tolerance appears to develop
to the lethal toxicity level since chronic users are as
susceptible to fatal over-doses as are initiates. In other words,
the safety margin decreases with increased tolerance. Several
mechanisms operate in producing tolerance. Barbiturates stimulate
the body's production of the metabolic enzymes which inactivate
the drug. Also, some insensitivity to the depressant effects
appears which might reflect a general neurological adaptation.
Certain learning processes are also probably involved in changing
the character of the response upon repeated administrations. Most
aspects of tolerance disappear after a few weeks of abstinence
from the drug. </p>

<p>Although barbiturates were not recognized as 'addictive' drugs
for decades after their general medical acceptance and usage, in
chronic users, physical dependence may develop along with
tolerance. Barbiturate dependence is in some respects similar to
opiate narcotic dependence, although barbiturate (and alcohol)
withdrawal symptoms are frequently more severe and are more
likely to result in death. The abstinence syndrome following
withdrawal of the drug in chronic heavy users may begin with a
reduction in intoxication and an apparent improvement in
condition. Within a few hours, however, general physical
weakness, dizziness, anxiety, tremors, hyperactivity, nausea,
abdominal cramps and vomiting may occur. These may be followed
after one-and-one-half to five days by muscle spasms and grand
mal (epileptic) seizures. Between the third and seventh day,
delusions and hallucinations may appear; this psychosis may last
for days or even months although recovery usually occurs within a
week or two. Death during the convulsive phase occasionally
occurs. 111, 89 </p>

<p>56. The full picture of barbiturate withdrawal only appears
after heavy chronic use, and the effects of abstinence following
more moderate consumption are considerably less severe, and may
manifest only a few of the classic symptoms. Many regular users
of therapeutic doses develop neither significant tolerance nor
physical dependence. As is the case with alcohol and opiate
narcotics, babies born of mothers physically dependent on
barbiturates are also physically dependent on the same drugs. </p>

<p>Psychological dependence also occurs in some users, and
anxious or tense individuals may become dependent on even small
doses in order to function in<b> </b>a manner which they consider
satisfactory. Many persons depend upon the hypnotic effects of
the barbiturates and can not sleep without a pill. In other
individuals, the drug may be depended upon for a variety of
subjective effects which the user considers essential to his
well-being. The problem of psychological and behavioural
dependence on barbiturates has not been adequately explored,
however, and remains in the area of clinical impression and
conjecture. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Barbiturates
and Other Drugs </h3>

<p>57. Because of the many similarities between barbiturates and
other sedatives, they are often used interchangeably. A certain
amount of cross-tolerance exists among these drugs, and chronic
users of barbiturates are generally quite resistant to many of
the effects of alcohol, minor tranquillizers and volatile
anaesthetics, as well. This cross-tolerance, however, does not
appear to affect the lethal dose, and large quantities of alcohol
and barbiturates taken simultaneously (acting in an additive
fashion) may produce a toxic or fatal reaction. In addition, the
sedative drugs have the capacity to be substituted for each other
in diminishing withdrawal symptoms, and barbiturates are
frequently used therapeutically to reduce the severity of
withdrawal in alcoholics. Since the sedatives show this
cross-dependence, individuals dependent on one may turn to other
sedatives if the supply of the preferred drug is restricted.
Consequently, chronic barbiturate dependents are usually heavy
alcohol users as well. Such multiple users often refer to the
barbiturate intoxication as a 'dry drunk'. Barbiturates have the
advantage of producing inebriation without the obvious odour of
alcohol. </p>

<p>The relationship between barbiturates and the opiate narcotics
is more complicated. These drugs may not show significant
cross-tolerance, although barbiturates can be useful in the
treatment of opiate narcotic withdrawal symptoms and<b> </b>may
effectively reduce the unpleasantness of the abstinence syndrome.
The drugs do interact in some sort of complementary way since
barbiturates are frequently, used by opiate narcotic dependents
to strengthen or reinforce a weak heroin dose or as a substitute
in an emergency. Many opiate users, however, avoid barbiturates
and consider the barbiturate-dependent person to be at the bottom
of the 'addict' community, together with the alcoholics. </p>

<ol>
    <li>Barbiturates are often used in conjunction with
        amphetamines. Dexamyl*, for example, is a combination of
        dextroamphetamine and amobarbital which supposedly
        produces stimulation without certain of the irritation or
        tension-producing effects of the amphetamines. More
        important clinically, is the frequently noted alternating
        cycle of sedation and stimulation which many medical and
        non-medical drug users demonstrate. A stimulant may be
        used to overcome the drowsy hangover the day after a
        hypnotic dose of barbiturate. By evening, another
        sedative dose may be necessary to overcome the insomnia
        potentiated by the day's amphetamine. This continuing
        cycle is apparently not at all uncommon among otherwise
        socially respectable drug users. A somewhat related
        pattern has been demonstrated by some amphetamine
        injecting 'speed freaks' who use barbiturates to
        terminate the stimulant effect or produce sleep after a
        'high' of several days' duration. </li>

<h3>ALCOHOL </h3>

<p> </p>

<p>59. Alcohol is one of the most widely used psychoactive drugs
known to man; it has apparently been with us since the dawn of
civilization. Breweries flourished in Egypt almost six thousand
years ago and there is evidence that Stone Age prehistoric man
made alcoholic beverages long before that.223 The use of alcohol
has appeared in varying degrees in most societies throughout
recorded history and has traditionally played an important
symbolic as well as pharmacological role in many social,
religious and medical practices and customs. Just as the use of
alcohol has been almost universal, so, apparently, has its
misuse. Consequently, some degree of opposition to 'drink'
appears to have arisen in all indulging cultures, although
attempts to eradicate its use have met with a uniform lack of
success. </p>

<p>What is this drug which has been hailed as the 'water of life'
and 'nectar of the gods' by some, and damned by others as 'second
only to war' as a source of human problems? Made up of three
common elements, carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, ethyl alcohol
(C2H5OH) is a colourless, inflammable and volatile liquid. The
word 'alcohol' by itself is usually taken to mean ethyl alcohol
or <i>ethanol </i>(common beverage alcohol), although there is a
vast number of other substances in the aliphatic alcohol family,
many of which are highly toxic in even low doses. </p>

<p>Although the technique of producing alcoholic beverages by
fermenting fruit, grain, vegetables, and other food-stuffs has
hardly been a secret over the past few thousand years, the exact
process by which the drug is generated was first illuminated by
Louis Pasteur in the middle of the nineteenth century. His
investigations revealed that alcohol was produced by a single
celled microscopic plant, one of the yeast fungi, which by a
metabolic form of combustion breaks down certain sugars,
releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) with ethyl alcohol as a
by-product. This production of CO2 is responsible for the 'head'
on a glass of beer, and the 'popping' of champagne corks, as well
as the leavening effects of yeast in the rising of bread. Since
yeast cannot digest starch, mash from cereal grains such as
barley, rye, corn and rice must be malted (i.e., converted to
maltose sugar) prior to fermentation in the production of beer,
gin and whisky. </p>

<p>60. Fermentation normally continues until the sugar supply is
exhausted. However, as the amount of alcohol in the fermenting
solution increases, the metabolic activity of the yeast is slowed
until it is finally killed when the alcohol level reaches about
14%, thus setting a limit on the maximum strength of natural
(undistilled) beverages. The distillation process of boiling off
and isolating the more volatile alcohol from the other fluids
(mostly water) allows a further increase in ethanol
concentration. Although this technique was used in Middle Eastern
cultures centuries earlier, the production of 'spirits' by
distillation has been known in Europe for less than seven hundred
years. Today, ethanol can be produced synthetically. </p>

<p>In Canada, beer usually contains about 5% alcohol by volume,
natural wine 7% to 14%, fortified wine up to 20% and spirits or
liquor (distilled) approximately 40% alcohol. In other words, a
12 oz. bottle of beer or 3 to 4 oz. of wine contain about as much
alcohol as 11/2 oz. of whisky. </p>

<p>61. The notion of alcohol 'proof' originated centuries ago
from a crude but effective analytic technique designed to assess
the strength of spirits. If gun powder soaked with the beverage
exploded on ignition, this was taken as 'proof' that the liquor
was more than half alcohol. 'Proof spirit' in the United Kingdom
and Canadian system contains about 57% alcohol, while in the
United States proof is calculated as twice the per cent by volume
(e.g., 80% proof whisky is 40% alcohol).80 </p>

<p>Canada has experimented with alcohol prohibition in varying
ways since 1878. Although there are currently some 'dry'
localities, alcohol is generally legally available across the
country. An interesting bit of drug history is connected with
alcohol law: over 300 years ago the prohibition of liquor sales
to Indians was Canada's first alcohol regulation. Some such
discriminatory policies are only now being eliminated. 32 </p>

<p>62. There was a 15-year period of prohibition in the United
States, ending in 1934. The failure of that programme has been
attributed to the unworkable form of the laws, inadequate
enforcement, corruption among public authorities and, perhaps
most importantly, a general lack of public support. During that
period, the elimination of legitimate alcohol outlets resulted in
home breweries and distilleries, 'bootleg' liquor or toxic
substitutes, and smuggling, and created an economic vacuum
rapidly filled by organized crime. Many authorities feel that
this multi-million-dollar illicit market provided the initial
capital for the construction of a network of syndicated criminal
and quasilegal business empires which have considerable economic
and political strength in North America today. </p>

<p>Alcohol is now used by more than three-quarters of the
Canadian population over the age of 15. Although most of it is
undoubtedly consumed primarily for its pharmacological
properties, there is a significant aspect of alcohol usage which
is, in some respects, independent of its immediate drug effects.
There are many long-standing customs, traditions and
superstitions which pervade alcohol use in the Western world.
Because it has become an integral part of our culture, the set
and setting surrounding alcohol use is substantially different
from that associated with other drugs in Canada. </p>

<p>63. Alcohol may have special meanings in various social
contexts. Alcohol use is often symbolically and pharmacologically
associated with the acknowledgment of birth, death, marriage and
other contracts, adulthood, friendship, and, to some, it may
imply virility and masculinity. Although it is employed in some
religious ceremonies, many individuals have moral apprehensions
about alcohol and may approach its use with feelings of
ambivalence and guilt. Some reject it outright on grounds of
principle, while still others feel that moderate use is morally
acceptable. In many social circles abstinence is frowned upon and
'teetotallers' are looked upon with suspicion. On the other hand,
it is obvious that considerable alcohol intoxication is
tolerated, condoned and even encouraged in many situations in
North American society. When one considers the fact that these
various attitudes are ultimately tied to, or interact with, the
diverse pharmacological potentials of alcohol in determining the
overall drug effect, the complexity of the psychopharmacology of
the drug in North America becomes apparent. Because its use is so
ingrained at all levels of society, there is a tendency for many
Canadians not to even consider alcohol a drug. </p>

<p>In a wider context, Jaffe, in <i>The Pharmacological Basis of
Therapeutics </i>observes: 111 </p>

<p>The large role that the production and consumption of
alcoholic beverages plays in the economic and social life in
Western society should not permit us to minimize the fact that
alcoholism is a more significant problem than all other forms of
drug abuse combined. </p>

<h3>Medical Use </h3>

<p>64. Alcohol is currently recognized as an official drug in the
British and U.S. Pharmacopeias, although the various alcoholic
beverages, as such, are no longer listed for medical use. Alcohol
has been cited over the past few thousand years as a cure for
nearly every ailment or disease. Most of the medical benefits
were probably more imagined than real, and many of alcohol's
legitimate pharmacological functions have now been filled by more
effective drugs, although it still plays a useful role in
medicine. </p>

<p>Alcohol is often used as a preservative, solvent, and vehicle
for other drugs, and is contained in tinctures, elixirs, spirits
and many medicinal syrups. It is used to cleanse, disinfect and
harden the skin, to cool it during fever, to decrease sweating
(and is included in many antiperspirant deodorant), to reduce bed
sores, to treat fainting, to temporarily or permanently block
nerves by injection, and to stimulate appetite and digestion. In
concentrations around 70%, alcohol is an effective antibacterial
agent, although it is not satisfactory for disinfecting open
wounds since it damages the raw tissue.186 </p>

<p>Alcohol is still sometimes recommended as a tranquillizer,
sedative, or hypnotic and may also serve as a mild mood stimulant
for<i> </i>some individuals. It is no longer considered a safe
surgical anaesthetic, since the dose necessary to produce
unconsciousness is often dangerously close to the fatal level.
However, the drug does produce mild analgesia (pain reduction) at
lower doses. Alcohol is still used in the lay and folk medicine
to 'treat' the common cold, although its benefits, if any, are
probably limited to an improvement in mood and increased
relaxation and rest. </p>

<h3>Administration, Absorption, Distribution and Physiological
Fate </h3>

<p>65. Alcohol is usually taken orally and is rapidly and
completely absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Some
absorption takes place in the stomach although diffusion into the
blood stream is most rapid from the upper intestine and,
consequently, the quicker the alcohol passes through the stomach
the shorter the latency of its action. Food eaten before or with
alcohol tends to decrease the drug effect by slowing stomach
emptying, and a meal before drinking alcohol may reduce the peak
alcohol level in the blood by almost one-half compared to that
attained by drinking on an empty stomach. Once absorbed, alcohol
is distributed quite uniformly in all bodily fluids, easily
enters the brain, and in pregnant women crosses the placental
barrier into the foetus. Alcohol temporarily diffuses into fat
tissue and consequently, a lean muscular individual will normally
experience a greater pharmacological effect with a given dose
than will a person with much body fat. </p>

<p>Approximately 95% of the alcohol in the body is broken down by
oxidation in the liver and the rest is excreted unchanged,
primarily in the urine and breath. While certain alcoholic
beverages, such as beer, contain some protein and carbohydrates,
alcohol itself provides only calories when metabolized and has
little general food value. Depending on the form of alcoholic
beverage and possible mixers, an ordinary drink may contain 90 to
150 calories or<b> </b>more. The rate of disappearance of alcohol
from the body is quite constant within individuals at a given
time, and the average 150 lb. man can metabolize about 9 ml. (0.3
oz) of alcohol per hour. </p>

<p>A convenient index of the quantity of the drug in the body is
the <i>blood alcohol level, </i>represented in per cent by
weight. Since the amount of alcohol excreted in the breath bears
a fixed relationship to that in the blood, it is possible to
accurately estimate the blood alcohol level from expired air.
This principle is utilized in the <i>Breathalyzer </i>tests now
employed in the enforcement of driving laws. </p>

<h3>Short-Term Effects </h3>

<p>66. Alcohol exerts its more significant effects through the
central nervous system, usually producing a general sedation or
depression of neural activity over a wide dosage range, although
in certain circumstances, considerable behavioural and
psychological arousal may result. Little is known as to the
specific mechanism by which alcohol produces its
psychopharmacological action. As with most drugs, alcohol
effects, especially those resulting from low or moderate amounts,
depend to a large extent on the individual and the situation in
which the drinking occurs. A drink or two may produce drowsiness
and lethargy in some instances, while the same quantity might
lead to increased activity and psychological stimulation in
another individual, or in the same person in different
circumstances. Furthermore, a dose which is initially stimulating
may later produce sedation. </p>

<p>In many social settings, alcohol seems to result in a
lessening of inhibition and a feeling of well being, sociability
and camaraderie in most individuals. For many people alcohol
relieves tension and anxiety - the common notion that one 'needs
a drink' when worried, irritated or upset, reflects a general
acknowledgment of this function. Although alcohol usually
elevates mood at first, a general lack of emotional control,
including anxiety, withdrawal, self-pity and depression may occur
later. Alcohol has been frequently cited as an important
contributing factor in many suicides. </p>

<p>Hostility and aggression are not at all uncommon in some
drinkers, and fights and other forms of violent antisocial
behaviour are often reported to accompany bouts of heavy
drinking. It appears that some criminals fortify their courage by
drinking prior to a sortie and alcohol intoxication reportedly
plays a significant role in a large proportion of the violent
crimes (murder, rape and assault against persons and property) in
North America.18 </p>

<p>67. Alcohol does not have a specific aphrodisiac (sex
stimulating) effect <i>per se, </i>although the emotionality and
general lessening of inhibitions often induced may lead to an
increase in sexual activity and other normally restricted
behaviour. An increase in desire or opportunity may be neglected
by acute sexual impotence, however. </p>

<p>Although delusions, illusions and amnesic 'black outs' may
occur in some individuals, acute alcohol psychosis (pathological
intoxication) in normally moderate drinkers is rare. Even so,
many persons might sympathize with the Roman philosopher Seneca
who, almost 2,000 years ago, observed that, 'Drunkenness is
nothing but a condition of insanity purposely assumed'.197 </p>

<p>In moderate amounts (e.g., a few drinks) alcohol may increase
or decrease heart rate, produce a 'flushing' or dilation of small
blood vessels in the skin (giving a sensation of warmth), lower
body temperature, stimulate appetite and the secretion of saliva
and gastric juices, increase urination, produce a slowing of the
electroencephalogram (EEG), increase reaction time, reduce
muscular co-ordination. In addition, alcohol generally reduces
performance on tests of a wide variety of psychological
functions. Tests requiring a high degree of attention,
concentration or vigilance are particularly sensitive to alcohol
effects, and impairment is usually most pronounced on complex and
recently learned tasks. In a few situations, however, a small
amount of alcohol may actually improve performance. In high
doses, alcohol produces drunkenness, disorientation and
confusion, slurred speech, blurred vision, inadequate muscular
control, and often induces nausea and vomiting. As an increasing
quantity is ingested, there occurs a depression of respiration,
general anesthesia and unconsciousness and, rarely, death due to
respiratory arrest and circulatory failure. Acute alcohol
intoxication is often followed by pronounced 'hangover' symptoms
characterized by nausea, weakness, dizziness, poor coordination
and a variety of aches and pains. Some authorities consider this
post-inebriation phase a form of acute withdrawal syndrome. </p>

<p>68. Effects of alcohol on driving ability are well known -
even moderate amounts produce serious impairment in many
individuals. A recent study of alcohol involvement in fatal motor
vehicle accidents in three Canadian provinces presented findings
similar to those reported regularly across North America.37 It
has commonly been observed that alcohol is a factor in a large
proportion of all fatal traffic accidents. Approximately 70% of
drivers killed in single vehicle accidents and 50% of drivers
killed in multi-vehicle collisions had been drinking. Among all
driver fatalities, alcohol was detected in the blood of 60 to 70
per cent of those considered responsible for their own deaths.
Furthermore, more than half of the pedestrians killed in traffic
accidents had recently been drinking, and there are numerous
reports that alcohol is a contributing factor in a great number
of industrial accidents as well. A large proportion of the people
involved in such accidents are chronic alcoholics, although the
majority are apparently 'social' drinkers. </p>

<p>The intensity of the acute effects of alcohol can, to a
certain extent, be predicted from the amount of alcohol in the
blood, although the relationship between the quantity of alcohol
present and the central nervous system (CNS) response may vary
considerably from individual to individual. Recent Federal
legislation prohibits driving with blood alcohol level greater
than 0.08%. Depending on the person, this concentration may be
produced by three or four ordinary drinks, if consumed in a short
time. While certain individuals might be capable of driving
satisfactorily with this much alcohol, most persons are probably
impaired by even lower quantities. Although the <i>Breathalyzer </i>can
be used to assess acute alcohol intoxication, there are no simple
methods of detecting a 'hangover', and there are indications that
this post-inebriation phase also has severe effects on
psychomotor performance. </p>

<h3>Long-Term Effects </h3>

<p>69. Many authorities differentiate between 'low risk'
(moderate) and 'high risk' (heavy) drinking in discussing the
long-term effects of alcohol. For most otherwise normal
individuals, moderate drinking over a prolonged period of time
may produce little significant psychological or physiological
change. High risk or heavy drinking (e.g., five or six or more
drinks a day) may lead to a variety of disorders, however, many
of which are subsumed under the general term 'alcoholism'. </p>

<p>There<b> </b>is considerable disagreement among authorities as
to the proper delineation of the concept of alcoholism -
definitions may be as general as 'a family of disorders
accompanying chronic heavy drinking 'with various social and
economic complications, or may contain more restrictive
specifications of physical dependency or psychological and
physiological harm. Jellinek has described five different types
of alcoholics which differ in degree and kind of psychological,
behavioural and physiological involvement.112 In some areas of
North America, at least two per cent to five per cent of alcohol
users become alcoholics and many more would be considered problem
drinkers. </p>

<p>70. No group of drug-dependent persons presents a sorrier
picture of psychological and physiological pathology than that of
the 'skid row' derelict alcoholics. Frequently observed in these
individuals and many other alcoholics are disorders of the
digestive tract, cardiovascular system, lungs, kidney, pancreas
and the nervous system, with sleep disturbance and various kinds
of irreversible neurological damage and cerebral atrophy.
Considerable attention has been focused on liver disorders in
heavy drinkers, and it is well established that alcohol is a
major contributing or causal factor in liver cirrhosis.
Alcoholics may develop specific psychotic syndromes, permanently
impaired memory, epilepsy, chronic incoordination, sexual
impotence, loss of appetite and a variety of nutritional
disorders which may result in an increased susceptibility to
other diseases and infections.111 </p>

<p>In the past, these and numerous other disorders were thought
to be a direct result of alcohol toxicity, but now many of these
pathologies are considered to be of secondary origin - often a
function of chronic dietary deficiencies, poor personal care and
other aspects of the general life style which may accompany
alcoholism. The diet of certain alcoholics may consist of 40-50%
alcohol, with periods of weeks or even months of nothing else,
and thus may be dangerously low in proteins, vitamins, minerals
and other essential foodstuffs. Proper diet and medical care may
be able to prevent or alleviate many, but not all, of the
problems associated with chronic alcoholism.182 </p>

<p>Only a minority of alcoholics are 'down and out' derelicts,
and there are many alcohol-dependent persons in all levels of
society who function in varying degrees of effectiveness in spite
of the handicap. Psychological and physiological disorders in
these individuals vary considerably as a function of general life
style, drinking patterns and perhaps certain inherited
characteristics. Many heavy drinkers show little functional
impairment. </p>

<h3>Tolerance and Dependence </h3>

<p>71. Tolerance to most of the effects of alcohol develops with
frequent use, although it does not occur as rapidly or to the
same degree as with the opiate narcotics. The rate of acquisition
and extent of tolerance depends on the pattern of use, and
regular heavy drinkers may be able to consume two or three times
as much alcohol as a novice. In Western culture, some symbolic
masculinity frequently accompanies the development of tolerance
and the ability to 'hold one's liquor'. </p>

<p>Most intermittent or moderate drinkers show little tendency to
increase dose, although regular heavy drinkers may, in order to
obtain the desired psychological effects, ingest quantities which
lead to chronic alcohol toxicity symptoms. In addition to the
probable neurophysiological and metabolic mechanisms involved in
tolerance, learning to function under the influence of alcohol
may further reduce some of the acute behavioural effects of
intoxication in regular users. Little or no tolerance develops to
the lethal dose, however, and acute alcohol poisoning is a noted
cause of death in alcoholics, although nausea, vomiting and
unconsciousness usually prevent self-administration of a fatal
overdose. In some alcoholics, tolerance later seems to decline
and a special response or oversensitivity to certain effects of
alcohol develops. In such individuals even a single drink may
produce profound loss of control and initiate unrestricted
further indulgence. </p>

<p>72. Physical dependence on alcohol occurs in some long-term
heavy drinkers after the development of tolerance. Although
alcoholic hallucinosis, delirium tremens ('DT's), and convulsions
('rum fits') were noted and studied in the nineteenth century,
until recently there was a lack of consensus as to whether these
symptoms were essentially the direct result of acute or chronic
alcohol toxicity, secondary nutritional deficiencies, or part of
a physical dependence withdrawal syndrome. </p>

<p>Isbell <i>et al</i>108<i> </i>and Mendelson <i>et al</i>156<i>
</i>have clearly demonstrated that even when diet is controlled,
a characteristic severe abstinence syndrome can occur after only
a few weeks of continual heavy drinking. The quantities of
alcohol ingested in these studies were much greater than those
normally consumed, however, and with the usual drinking patterns,
such physiological dependence does not occur until after 3 to 15
or more years of heavy consumption. Some heavy drinkers never
become physically dependent on alcohol.112 </p>

<p>73. The overall picture of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome is
generally similar to that noted earlier for barbiturates. Nausea,
anxiety, severe agitation, confusion, tremors, and sweating are
followed by cramps, vomiting and illusions and hallucinations.
After several days, delirium tremens may develop and convulsions,
exhaustion and cardiovascular collapse may occur. The delirium
tremens stage is fatal in about 10% of cases. Major recovery in
those surviving usually occurs within a week, although certain
psychological symptoms may continue for a longer period.234 </p>

<p>Psychological dependence on alcohol seems to occur<b> </b>in
many individuals, and such dependence appears to be generally
accepted in contemporary North America. A great number of people
regularly turn to alcohol for relief or aid prior to or after
facing a stressful situation, to escape worries, troubles or
boredom, to relax and enjoy a party, or even to sleep, and many
feel they do not function as well in certain situations without a
drink or two. There would appear to be a strong psychological
component in the drinking behaviour of the developing alcoholic,
as<b> </b>is exemplified in the usually compulsive nature of his
drinking and his frequent inability to control his use of alcohol
in spite of obvious consequences. </p>

<h3>Alcohol and Other Drugs </h3>

<p>74. A certain degree of cross-tolerance and cross-dependence
occurs among the sedative drugs. Heavy alcohol users are normally
resistant to the effects of barbiturates, minor tranquillizers,
volatile solvents and anaesthetics, as well as alcohol, although
the cross-tolerance does not significantly affect the lethal
dose. Consequently, many over-dose deaths occur due to the mixing
of these drugs in chronic users. Barbiturates and minor
tranquillizers effectively block alcohol withdrawal symptoms and
are frequently used in treating alcoholics in the acute phase of
abstinence. Alcoholics are often heavy users of other sedative
drugs as well and may switch from one to another, if it<b> </b>is
convenient or necessary. The use of high toxic alcohols, such as
methyl or 'wood' alcohol, and even automobile anti-freeze, has
been reported in derelict alcoholics. In addition, persons
dependent on opiate narcotics generally have a history of heavy
alcohol consumption. </p>

<p>75. Certain drugs, such as disulfiram (Antabuse*) or
Temposil*, which may have little direct pharmacological activity
themselves, have the capacity to inhibit certain stages of
alcohol metabolism in the body and can thereby produce a highly
unpleasant toxic reaction known as the <i>acetaldehyde syndrome </i>when
used in conjunction with alcohol. Such drugs have been used in
the treatment of problem drinkers. </p>

<p>Amphetamines, caffeine and other stimulants may reduce the
drowsiness often associated with inebriation, although they can
not fully compensate for most of the effects of alcohol
intoxication. <br>

<h3>MINOR TRANQUILIZERS </h3>

<p> </p>

<p>76. The term 'minor tranquilizers' was introduced into the
scientific literature in the 1950s to distinguish the medicines
prescribed to reduce anxiety and tension from the <i>major </i>tranquillizers,
like reserpine and chlorpromazine, which are employed (as
antipsychotic drugs) in the treatment of severe mental illness
such as schizophrenia. Another phrase, often used interchangeably
with the words 'minor tranquilizers' is <i>anxiolytic sedatives. </i>This
class of drugs may be defined as substances which reduce anxiety,
tension and agitation without other significant effects on
cognition or perceptual processes. </p>

<p>It seems safe to say that the optimal anxiolytic sedative,
which effectively separates anxiety-reducing properties from
those producing undesired psychological side effects does not yet
exist. There are a variety of drugs of several chemical classes
which approximate these criteria, however: bromides, paraldehyde,
chloral hydrate; the newer minor tranquillizers such as
meprobamate (Miltown*), diazepam (Valium*), and chlordiazepoxide
(Librium*) and assorted other compounds (e.g., ethchlorvynol,
glutethimide) which do not fall into a neat chemical
classification. Alcohol and barbiturates are also<b> </b>often
considered with the anxiolytic sedatives, although we will keep
them separate in the following discussions since they have
already been covered in previous sections of this report. </p>

<p>77. Most minor tranquillizers fall between alcohol and
barbiturates in sedative action at a therapeutic dose. The
disparate classes of chemicals have generally similar
physiological action and will be treated as a group, with
individual differences sometimes characterized. The minor
tranquillizers have tended to replace barbiturates as day-time
sedatives in recent years. These drugs and other sedatives are
commonly referred to as 'downers' in the drug argot. </p>

<p>In Canada and the U.S.A., well over $500 million is spent each
year on sedative drugs, to treat a wide variety of symptoms
falling under the category of anixety.131 Although there are no
statistics available to us at this time on the Canadian imports,
exports, manufacture, production or sale of minor tranquillizers,
many observers feel that the supply greatly exceeds medical
needs. The distribution route which the drugs follow after
production is not known, and a considerable percentage may be
diverted for non-medical use. Clandestine manufacture of minor
tranquillizers does not appear to occur and all such drugs
initially start into the market as lawful materials. As described
in the section on barbiturates, patients may be able to procure
large quantities of these drugs through legitimate prescription
channels. </p>

<p>79. In the U.S., production figures for tranquillizers exceed
those for 'sleeping pills', 'pep pills', and opiate narcotics
combined.77 In additional,178 </p>

<p>In 1965 in the U.S.A., some 58 million new prescriptions and
108 million refills were written for psychotropes (sedatives,
tranquillizers and stimulants) and these 166 million
prescriptions accounted for 14% of the total prescriptions of all
kinds written in the United States. </p>

<p>79. Minor tranquillizers are so widely prescribed that the
American Medical Association warned doctors about
overprescription and outlined ways in which the 'misuse of
sedatives' by 'the prolonged and unsupervised<b> </b>administration
of (tranquillizers) for symptomatic relief often without adequate
diagnosis or knowledge of the patient's past experience with
medications, or attitudes towards drugs' is aggravated.8 Evidence
in these recent U.S. surveys indicates that the minor
tranquillizers and other sedatives are more commonly used than
the stimulants among respondents above age 20. </p>

<p>The minor tranquillizers, along with barbiturates, tobacco,
and alcohol, are among the most widely used drugs in North
American society, and are the toxic agents in a large number of
poisoning cases. Since chronic tranquillizer dependence may be
quite frequent, and may involve considerable impairment, the
public's relative indifference to the hazards of tranquillizer
pill-popping is quite alarming. As in the case of alcohol and
barbiturates, much research on medical use has been done, but
little investigation of non-medical use of tranquillizers has
been carried out. </p>

<h3>Medical Use </h3>

<p>80. Minor tranquillizers are widely used in medical practice
today, and are mainly prescribed for patients suffering from
anxiety, tension, behavioural excitement and insomnia. They are
also used in the treatment of lower back pain, convulsive
disorders and withdrawal symptoms of opiate narcotic and alcohol
dependence. </p>

<p>Some clinicians feel that chemotherapy of anxiety is a
secondary approach (although frequently the most expedient) and
that the minor tranquillizers should be used primarily to relieve
immediate distress, and to aid the patient only until other
treatment procedures become effective. </p>

<h3>Administration, Absorption, Distribution and Physiological
Fate </h3>

<p>81. Minor tranquillizers are usually administered orally as
elixirs or<b> </b>tablets, but are also sometimes injected, for
both medical and non-medical purposes. They are generally rapidly
absorbed by the stomach, intestine and rectum, and the absorption
is most rapid with an empty stomach. Once absorbed, the drugs are
distributed quite uniformly throughout the body, with the latency
of response dependent on the particular chemical class. Some are
metabolized, or otherwise chemically altered (usually in the
liver), and excreted into the urine, while others are eliminated
unchanged. The factors of distribution, metabolism, and
excretion, are primarily responsible for differences in potency
and duration of action of the different minor tranquillizers. The
detection of some acute and chronic tranquillizer use is not
easy, and the methods of detection of the metabolites in urine
are highly sophisticated and expensive. </p>

<h3>Psychological Effects </h3>

<p>82. Many of the psychological effects of minor tranquillizers
are similar to those observed with alcohol and barbiturates. As
with these other sedatives, psychological and behavioural
responses to low doses of minor tranquillizers are quite
variable. There may be a sedation in some instances and, in
others, an increase in activity. Studies reveal that complex
interactions between the type of drug and the level of anxiety
occur, even within the same pharmacological group; the drugs may
impair or improve performance, depending on dose and the degree
of anxiety present.131 </p>

<p>Normal doses usually provide relaxation, a feeling of
well-being and perhaps some loss of inhibition. With excessive
use of these drugs the following effects may be observed;
disorientation, confusion, memory impairment, trance-like
episodes, double vision, personality alterations, rage reactions
and other symptoms resembling those of drunkenness. Such
manifestations are difficult to differentiate from the
inebriation caused by barbiturates and alcohol. </p>

<p>83. It appears that driving skills may not be impaired at
clinical doses, so long as the user is not already drowsy or has
not taken other sedatives such as alcohol. At higher doses,
driving skills are more likely to be seriously impaired. One
report states that the accident rate in a group of drivers using
prescribed doses of Librium* was 10 times the general accident
rate for New York State, but it is not clear whether the accident
rate among these drivers who 'needed' a tranquillizer, was so
high because of, or in spite of, the drug they were taking.167 In
Canada it is an offence to drive under the influence of drugs,
and the penalties are similar to those for drunken driving,
although convictions involving tranquillizers are rarely
reported.. </p>

<h3>Physiological Effects </h3>

<p>84. The response to moderate and high doses of minor
tranquillizers is a general depression of nervous and muscular
activity and several other bodily functions. Compared with other
sedatives, the newer minor tranquillizers may have less
inhibitory effect on the parts of the brain which are responsible
for arousal and motor control and may have greater muscle
relaxant effects. The minor tranquillizers affect the levels of
some neurohumors in the brain which may be involved in the
tension-anxiety states. However, the exact mechanism by which
these drugs produce their effects is unknown. </p>

<p>Side effects observed with these drugs include drowsiness,
ataxia, lethargy, skin rashes, nausea, diminished sex interest,
menstrual and ovulatory irregularities, blood abnormalities and
increased sensitivity to alcohol. High doses may depress
respiration, produce unconsciousness and coma and can produce
death. There is no clear evidence of permanent irreversible
damage to neurological or other physiological processes even with
long-term non-medical use. The fact that chronic users of minor
tranquillizers maintain a reasonable diet and are not reported to
suffer from malnutrition, may account for some of the differences
between the chronic effects of tranquillizer use and alcoholism. </p>

<h3>Tolerance and Dependence </h3>

<p>85. Tolerance usually develops to most of the effects of the
minor tranquillizers on repeated use and the dose must often be
increased in order to obtain the desired effects. No tolerance
develops to the lethal toxicity, however, and chronic users must
be especially attentive to the quantities consumed. With one or
two exceptions, these drugs have been reported to produce both
psychological and physiological dependence, resembling that seen
with alcohol and the barbiturates. </p>

<p>The clinical descriptions of the abstinence syndrome, reported
to follow abrupt withdrawal, after excessive dosages of the minor
tranquillizers, indicate a marked similarity to one another and
to alcohol and barbiturates. The syndrome may be characterized by
anxiety, apprehension, tremulousness, muscle twitches, insomnia,
headache, fever, loss of appetite, nausea, vomit, abdominal
cramps, sweating, tachycardia, fainting, hyperactive reflexes,
convulsions, and uncontrolled urination and defecation. In
addition, delirious states can occur with motor agitation,
hallucinations, delusions, disorientation and confusion. The
abstinence syndrome can be very serious, and deaths have been
attributed to withdrawal of meprobamate (Miltown*) and
methyprylon (Noludar*).72 </p>

<h3>Minor Tranquillizers and Other Drugs </h3>

<ol>
    <li>Cross-tolerance and cross-dependence exist among the
        minor tranquillizers and with other sedative drugs. This
        cross-tolerance does not appear to affect the lethal dose
        and, consequently, alcohol or barbiturates taken
        simultaneously with large quantities of minor
        tranquillizers may act additively and produce toxic or
        fatal reactions. Heavy users of these drugs may switch
        among the sedatives, if necessary or convenient, and
        alcoholics often use barbiturates and tranquillizers to
        sustain inebriation. Individuals dependent on opiate
        narcotics often also use large quantities of minor<b> </b>tranquillizers.
    </li>

<p>AMPHETAMINES </p>

<p> </p>

<p>87. Amphetamines are synthetic amines which are in many ways
similar to the body's own adrenaline (epinephrine). These drugs
generally evoke an arousal or activating response not unlike
one's normal reaction to emergency or stress. Amphetamines were
first synthesized in the early part of the century and entered
medical use by the 1930s. Although a variety of related drugs and
mixtures currently exist, the most common amphetamine substances
are amphetamine (Benzedrine*), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine*),
and methamphetamine (Methedrine* or Desoxyn*), with Benzedrine*
being the least potent. Generally, if the dose is adjusted, the
psychological effects of these various drugs are similar and,
consequently, they will be discussed as a group. Other drugs with
somewhat similar pharmacological properties are phenmetrazine
(Preludin*), methylphenidate (Ritalin*) and pipradol (Meratran*).
Common slang terms for amphetamines include: 'speed', 'crystal',
'meth', 'bennies', 'dexies', 'A', 'uppers', 'pep pills', 'diet
pills', 'jolly beans', 'truck drivers', 'co-pilots', 'eye
openers', 'wake-ups', 'hearts' and 'footballs'. </p>

<p>The stimulating effects of the amphetamines were widely used
by soldiers during World War II to counteract fatigue. Since
then, they have been commonly used both medically and
non-medically by vehicle drivers on long trips, night-shift
workers, fatigued housewives, students studying for exams and
others who must meet deadlines, athletes for increasing
performance, and others for general stimulation, pleasure or fun.
</p>

<p>88. In the 1940s, much of the wartime stockpile was dumped on
the world market and in many countries amphetamines were
available on a non-prescription 'over the counter' basis.
Widespread use followed in most industrialized areas with
numerous unpleasant consequences. Use reached epidemic
proportions, for example, in Japan in the 1950s - a country which
had never had a previous serious drug problem.34 Since this time,
amphetamines have been quite uniformly put under governmental
control and<b> </b>in some countries (e.g., Sweden) are currently
prohibited from medical and non medical applications. Although
the popularity of both medical and non-medical rise of these
drugs spread rapidly in all age groups and social classes in
North America after the war, heavy use was apparently largely
confined to delinquents and to members of the criminal-addict
population of a few decades ago. The drug was usually taken
orally, sometimes injected by heroin addicts, or sniffed. In many
instances it was used interchangeably with cocaine (a shortacting
but powerful stimulant). Frequent use was made of 'dismantled'
Denzedrine inhalers, which were on the unrestricted legal market
at that time. </p>

<p>More recently, major concern has developed in many circles for
a relatively new amphetamine phenomenon - that of massive doses
used intravenously by persons often referred to as ,speed
freaks'. Although this practice has been most frequently noted
among youthful multi-drug-taking individuals, considerable
opposition to such use of amphetamines has developed within the
'hip' community. The 'speed trip' is in many respects the
antithesis of the experience sought with the psychedelic drugs.
Instead of the orientation towards the 'consciousness expansion',
personal insight, and aesthetic and religious awareness often
attributed to the psychedelic drug experience by users, the speed
phenomenon is usually characterized by action, power, arrogance
and physical pleasure ('kicks'), and regularly leads to
suspicion, paranoia, hostility and often aggression. In addition
to these undesirable personality changes, which render 'speed
freaks' highly unpopular in the community, such individuals
generally present a picture of chronic ill-health unparalleled
among youthful drug users. </p>

<p>89. The message received by the Commission at public and
private hearings, and in written communications with youthful
drug users has been mostly negative towards 'speed'. Many
experienced illicit drug users consider amphetamines extremely
dangerous and undesirable, and have expressed surprisingly
hostile attitudes towards these drugs in no uncertain terms.
Recently, numerous persons well known to youth, who have had
considerable influence on drug attitudes during the past decade
(e.g.,, John Lennon and the Beatles, Frank Zappa and the Mothers
of Invention, Timothy Leary, and Donovan), have made public
statements against the use of 'speed' and related drugs. </p>

<p>Many physicians have suggested that the supply of amphetamines
legitimately imported and manufactured in Canada greatly exceeds
medical need. As with other prescription drugs which are widely
used, such as the barbiturates and tranquillizers, the
distinction between medical and non-medical use is not always
easily made. </p>

<h3>Medical Use </h3>

<p>90. As early as 1935, amphetamines (in doses from 20-200 mg)
were found to be a specific treatment for narcolepsy, an uncommon
illness which is characterized by sudden attacks of sleep and
weakness. Since the 1940s, amphetamines (in doses of 10-50<i> </i>mg)
have been used in the treatment of overactive children who showed
disorders of attention and impairment of learning capacity. In
the last few years, several investigators have again published
results of clinical trials which revealed that amphetamines and
methylphenidate were among the most effective treatments for
these childhood disorders. </p>

<p>Psychiatrists have frequently used intravenous injections of
methedrine (in doses of 15-30mg) for diagnostic purposes.
Administered in this fashion, the drug induces a state of
excitation, elation and increased talkativeness, during which a
previously inhibited patient might reveal information and
symptoms which may be considered important for the understanding
of his disorder. He might also express, more freely, previously
suppressed emotions. It has been observed that some patients with
a borderline psychosis show typical psychotic symptoms more
clearly following an injection of amphetamines. </p>

<p>At one time, these drugs were used in the treatment of
alcoholism and opiate narcotic dependency, but this practice was
abandoned because amphetamines often produce dependency when
taken for longer than two or three weeks. Since alcoholism is a
chronic condition, some alcoholics who took this treatment for
long periods of time became dependent on amphetamines and
alcohol. </p>

<p>91. Early hopes that amphetamines would prove to be an
effective general treatment for severe depression were soon
disappointed. Although these drugs are powerful stimulants and
increase a depressed person's activity, they may also make him
more anxious and agitated, deprive him of sleep, and may fail to
elevate his mood or to reverse the fundamental depressive
process. In some individuals, these drugs have been effective in
relieving mild depression and chronic fatigue, however. </p>

<p>Amphetamines, and some related drugs, have a strong
suppressive effect on appetite. Most so-called 'diet pills'
contain amphetamines or similar preparations. However, the
appetite suppressing action of amphetamines usually disappears
after about two weeks, together with the pleasant stimulating
effects, unless the dose is<b> </b>continuously increased. </p>

<p>Amphetamines have also been occasionally used to treat petit
mal epilepsy, parkinsonism, pregnancy nausea, asthma, nasal
congestion and sedative poisoning. Many observers feel that
because of the risk of dependency and undesirable personality
change with amphetamines, even the medical use of these
substances should be severely restricted. </p>

<h3>Administration, Absorption, Distribution and Physiological
Fate </h3>

<p>92. Amphetamines are available in a variety of tablets,
capsules (both in immediate and delayed release forms), elixirs,
injections and, until recently, inhalers. These drugs also appear
in powder ('crystal') form on the black market. Amphetamines are
available commercially combined with such drugs as barbiturates
(e.g., Dexamyl*) and other sedatives, atropine, caffeine,
vitamins and minerals,<b> </b>thyroid extract, and, on the
illicit market, amphetamines are reportedly sometimes added to
LSD. One of the most esoteric pharmaceutical combinations has
been described as follows:133 'This is a multi-coated tablet of
pentobarbital on the outside to induce sleep rapidly,
phenobarbital under a delayed dissolving coating to extend the
sleep, and under another coating, an amphetamine to awaken the
patient in the morning.' </p>

<p>Amphetamines are usually administered orally and are readily
absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Occasionally both
intramuscular and intravenous injections are used medically. In
the past, an amphetamine-base inhaler was also available.
Non-medical users may employ any of these administration routes,
including sniffing 'crystal', although chronic 'speed freaks'
prefer intravenous injections. </p>

<p>About half of the amphetamine which enters the body is
excreted unchanged in the urine, the remainder being previously
deactivated or chemically altered in the liver prior to
elimination. Although excretion is generally rather rapid, traces
of the drug can be found in the urine up to a week after
withdrawal. Because of the considerable proportion excreted
unchanged, certain individuals have been known to extract and
reuse crystals obtained from the urine. (This general practice of
'reclaiming' excreted drugs is not new and such procedures have
been recorded for centuries.) </p>

<h3>Effects </h3>

<p>93. Both the psychological and physiological response to
amphetamines vary profoundly with dose, and the effects of
intravenous<b> </b>injections of massive quantities may differ
greatly in character from, and bear little resemblance to,
responses to low doses administered orally. These effects vary
continuously over the full dosage range, but for clarification in
the following discussions, the use of moderate quantities of
amphetamines will be separated from the discussion of the
practice of high-dose intravenous injection. </p>

<p>94.<i> Moderate dose effects. </i>At typical therapeutic doses
(e.g., 5-30 mg), amphetamines produce electrophysiological signs
of central nervous system (CNS) activation along with a variety
of adrenaline-like peripheral (sympathomimetic) effects such as
increased blood pressure, pulse-rate and blood sugar, slight
dilation of some blood vessels and constriction of others,
widening of the pupils, increased respiration rate, depression of
appetite and some relaxation of smooth muscle. Such effects might
last 3-4 hours. </p>

<p>The psychological response varies considerably among
individuals, but might typically include increased wakefulness,
alertness, and vigilance, improvement in concentration and a
feeling of clearer thinking, greater responsiveness to
environmental stimuli, decreased fatigue and boredom, elevation
of mood, mild euphoria, a feeling of sociability, increased
initiative and energy, and increased verbal and other behavioural
activity. There may be an improvement in some simple mental
tasks, and athletic performance may be increased. In general,
improved functioning is most likely to occur when prior
performance was at a subnormal state due to drowsiness, fatigue
or boredom. </p>

<p>On the other hand, a moderate dose of amphetamines in
different individuals (or perhaps even in the same individual at
different times) might produce irritation, restlessness,
insomnia, blurred vision, tremor, nausea, headache, inability to
concentrate, dizziness, heart palpitation, confusion, anxiety,
chest pains, chilliness, diarrhoea or constipation, and other
adverse symptoms. In cases of higher dose or hypersensitivity,
delirium, panic, aggression, psychosis, hallucinations and
cardiovascular abnormalities may occur in some individuals.
Although deaths are rare, some have been reported among
athletes.15 </p>

<p>95. After continued administration of moderate doses, recovery
may be associated with fatigue, drowsiness and, not infrequently,
emotional depression. The increased energy and alertness elicited
by the drug merely postpones the need for rest and clearly
provides no long-term substitute for it. Many regular users of
stimulants rely on the drug for energy when fatigued and often do
not get proper rest for long periods of time. </p>

<p>The amphetamine toxic psychosis may be indistinguishable from
schizophrenia.56 While this syndrome is generally associated with
high-dose use, many of the symptoms have been observed with the
use of more moderate amounts. There does not appear to be any
irreversible physiological damage associated with long-term use
of moderate doses of amphetamines although temporary disorders do
occur. </p>

<p>96.<i> Tolerance and dependence with moderate doses. </i>Tolerance
to the various drug effects develops at different rates and to
different degrees - some responses 'drop out' in chronic use
sooner than others. The tendency to increase dose depends upon
which of the potential drug effects is rewarding or reinforcing
drug use. Many individuals, for instance, who use amphetamines to
control narcolepsy, may reach a stabilized dose and show very
little need for increased quantity over a period of years. On the
other hand, those using the drug to control appetite generally
increase their dose. Many psychological effects, such as the
mood-elevating response, may show a considerable sensitivity to
tolerance, and individuals who either began using the drug to
obtain these effects, or who acquired the taste for them after
initially using amphetamines for other<b> </b>purposes, generally
show a marked tendency to increase dose over time. Tolerance to
some of the toxic properties occurs, and certain chronic users
administer thousands of milligrams intravenously in a day, while
even a fraction of that quantity would be extremely toxic in a
non-tolerant user. As with other drugs, the rate of development
of tolerance to the different pharmacological effects depends on
the doses used, the frequency of administration and various
individual factors. No suggestion of physiological dependence on
amphetamines occurs with moderate doses; but psychological
dependence on even low doses is frequently reported, and is
considered a major hazard in both medical and non-medical
amphetamine use. </p>

<p>97.<i> High-dose effects. </i>The chronic high-dose
intravenous amphetamine syndrome has recently been described by
several authors.124, 71 The cycle or pattern of use usually
begins with several days of repeated injections (usually of
Methedrine*), gradually increasing in magnitude and frequency.
Some users<b> </b>may 'shoot' or 'crank' up to several thousand
milligrams in a single day. Initially the user may feel
energetic, talkative, enthusiastic, happy, confident and
powerful, and may initiate and complete highly ambitious tasks.
He does not sleep and usually<b> </b>eats very little. After the
first few days, however, toxic unpleasant symptoms become
stronger, especially as the dose is increased. These toxic
effects may be similar to those described earlier for lower
doses, but appear in amplified form. Some symptoms commonly
reported at this stage are: confused and disorganized patterns of
thought and behaviour, compulsive repetition of meaningless acts,
irritability, self-consciousness, suspiciousness, fear, and
hallucinations and delusions which may take on the
characteristics of a paranoid psychosis. Aggressive and
anti-social behaviour may occur at this time. Severe chest pains,
abdominal pain mimicking appendicitis and fainting have also been
reported .207 </p>

<p>Towards the end of the 'run' (usually less than a week), the
toxic symptoms<b> </b>dominate; the drug is discontinued, fatigue
sets in, and prolonged sleep follows, sometimes lasting several
days. Upon awakening, the user is usually lethargic, often
emotionally<b> </b>depressed and ravenously hungry. The user may<b>
</b>overcome these effects with another injection - thus
initiating the cycle anew. Runs are often separated by days or
weeks, however, at a<b> </b>time. In certain instances, 'down'
drugs, such as barbiturates or tranquillizers, or even opiate
narcotics may be used to 'crash' or terminate a run which has
become intolerable or otherwise unpleasant. </p>

<p>98. The immediate effects of the intravenous injection of
amphetamines are a sudden, overwhelming pleasurable 'rush' or
'flash' which has been described by users as 'an instant total
body orgasm'. This effect is qualitatively different from the
warm, drifting sensation associated with the opiate narcotics,
but is reported to be initially similar to the 'splash' produced
by intravenous cocaine.124 Some users claim that the immediate
pleasure of the injection is the prime motivation for the drug
use and that other effects are secondary. </p>

<p>Some individuals report that sexual activity is prolonged, and
may continue for hours. When orgasm finally comes it may be more
pleasurable than normal, although, on the other hand, some
describe an inability to reach a climax. While only a minority of
users report increased sexual activity, some people give this
reason as a primary one for taking the drug. 124,23 </p>

<p>Some investigators have reported that many users claim that
they take the drug for euphoria or 'kicks', or because it enables
them to be more confident and active. In addition, there are
reports of 'needle freaks', in whom the use of the hypodermic
syringe has special rewarding connotations. </p>

<p>99. The clinical picture of the chronic 'speed freak', is a
distressing one indeed. Continued use of massive doses of
amphetamines often leads to considerable weight loss, sores and
non-healing ulcers, brittle fingernails, tooth grinding, chronic
chest infections, liver disease, a variety of hypertensive
disorders, and in some cases, cerebral haemorrhage. 124<b> </b>The
extent to which these effects are the direct result of the drug
or the secondary consequences of poor eating habits, over
exertion and improper rest is unclear. Further complications may
be caused by unsterile injections, including hepatitis and a
variety of other infections.47 Although some users feel that
certain of their mental abilities have been impaired by
amphetamine use, no clear picture of permanent brain damage has
been demonstrated. </p>

<p>100. Heavy use of amphetamines frequently precipitates a
psychosis which is indistinguishable from paranoid schizophrenia.
In addition, several investigators contend that schizophrenics,
and others with borderline psychotic conditions, are more likely
to use the drug intravenously than are other individuals. In one
study, 41 % of those requiring hospital admission for treatment
of amphetamine disorders were thought to be schizophrenic before
taking the drug.100 However, there is still no reliable
information on what proportion of users develop psychoses and
what the predisposing factors actually are. The majority of acute
psychotic reactions occur towards the end of a run, and such
symptoms are usually dissipated by a few days rest. </p>

<p>'Speed freaks' are generally unpopular within the multi-drug
taking community and are often shunned. Consequently, these
individuals may live together in 'flash houses' totally occupied
by amphetamine users. Frequent 'hassles', aggression and violence
have been reported in such dwellings. Heavy users are generally
unable to hold a steady job because of the drug habit and often
have a parasitic relationship with the rest of the illicit
drug-using community. There are reports that many users support
themselves through petty crime.184, 23 </p>

<p>101<i>. High-dose dependency. </i>The question of physical
dependence on amphetamines depends on the definition of the
withdrawal symptoms necessary to meet the criterion. While it is
clear that withdrawing amphetamine from chronic users does not
produce the dramatic, physically painful and often dangerous
abstinence syndrome associated with alcohol, barbiturates, or
opiate narcotics, many investigators feel that the fatigue,
prolonged sleep, brain wave (EEG) changes, voracious appetite,
cardiovascular abnormalities, occasional gastrointestinal cramps,
lethargy and, often, severe emotional depression following the
'speed binge' constitute a physiological reaction analogous to
the more dramatic withdrawal seen with depressant drugs. 56,207 </p>

<p>The tendency for tolerance-producing drugs to manifest a
'rebound' type of physiological and psychological pattern upon
withdrawal has been given considerable attention; amphetamine
abstinence in chronic users is generally characterized by a
profound sedation, and depression of mood and physiological
function, while drugs such as the sedatives and the opiate
narcotics (all of which produce sleep in high doses) generally
exhibit a withdrawal syndrome of severe and toxic overstimulation
(in some instances to the point of convulsions). </p>

<p>The fact that amphetamines have, it any, a physically rather
benign withdrawal syndrome, clearly indicates that a profound
physical dependence is not a necessary component in an overall
severe drug dependency situation. Subjective psychological
factors seem to have considerably greater motivational importance
in many instances - especially with chronic high-dose amphetamine
use. </p>

<p>102.<i> 'Speed Kills'. </i>In recent years, the slogan 'Speed
Kills' has received much attention, and the idea appears to play
a significant role in the attitude that some users and non-users
have towards the drug. One commonly hears the view that once
you're 'on speed' you<b> </b>have only two to five years left to
live. Some chronic 'speed freaks' incorporate this notion into
the identity they present to others and the image they entertain
of themselves. Many observers contend that the chronic use of
intravenous amphetamines reflects a thinly disguised suicidal
tendency, as well as an attention and sympathy gaining device.
'Hello, I'm Philbert Desanex; I'm a speed freak and I'm going to
be dead by fall', is only a slightly exaggerated caricature of
the image purposefully projected by some of these individuals. </p>

<p>103. What is the evidence, in fact, that 'Speed Kills' in the
literal direct physical sense? Fatalities due to acute overdose
are rarely reported. We have no reliable knowledge of the extent
of intravenous amphetamine use, and although we hear many dire
predictions, there is no good information on the long-term
prognosis or outcome of such use. It would certainly appear,
however, that chronic adherence to this practice is most
detrimental to the individual and, often, to those with whom he
interacts. </p>

<p>Although there is no clear evidence that the life expectancy
of 'speed freaks' is lower than others living under similar
circumstances, many investigators suspect this to be so. While
there are few cases in the literature of death directly
attributed to chronic amphetamine use, Clement, Solursh and Van
Ast47 '... have recently become aware of a number of cases of
death on the streets (of Toronto) apparently related to high-dose
amphetamine abuse. At autopsy, however, pathological evidence of
death directly due to amphetamines is rare in such cases'. After
a thorough review of the literature, Cox and Smart of the
Addiction Research Foundation reported: 'Currently there is no
evidence available on mortality rates among speed users and it is
not certain that speed itself is a lethal drug. There is no
evidence to support or deny that &quot;Speed Kills&quot;.60 </p>

<p>The slogan was originally borrowed from a highway traffic
campaign of the last decade and it has been suggested that,
originally, in adopting this phrase, drug users were referring to
the 'death' of the personality, the 'spirit', or the freedom of
the individual when he becomes dependent on amphetamines, rather
than to physical mortality. </p>

<h3>Amphetamines and Other Drugs </h3>

<ol>
    <li>As noted earlier, amphetamines are frequently used in
        conjunction, or in alternation, with a variety of
        depressant drugs such as barbiturates, alcohol and even
        heroin. The barbiturate and amphetamine up-down cycle has
        been described in both youthful and 'respectable' adult
        users at a variety of doses. Amphetamines intensify,
        prolong or otherwise alter the effects of LSD and it is
        reported that the two drugs are sometimes mixed. In
        addition, it would appear that the majority of youthful
        speed users have also had experience with a variety of
        psychedelic and other illicit drugs. Persons dependent on
        the opiate narcotics also frequently make use of
        stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamine - either as
        mixtures of drugs or used separately on different
        occasions. It is interesting to note that STP (DOM) and
        the newer MDA, both extremely potent
        psychedelic-hallucinogenic drugs, are chemically closely
        related to amphetamine. </li>

<h2>LSD </h2>

<p> </p>

<p>105. One of the most remarkable and controversial drugs known
today is d-lysergic acid diethylamide-25, better known as LSD or
simply 'acid'. LSD is capable of producing profound and unusual
psychological changes in almost infinitesimal doses, with
relatively little general physiological effect and, along with
other related drugs, has exerted noticeable influence in a
variety of aesthetic, scientific, philosophic, religious and
social areas over the past two decades. LSD is often considered
the prototype of the drug class we have labelled
Psychedelic-Hallucinogens, although there are a great number of
less potent synthetic and naturally occurring substances with
somewhat similar psychopharmacological properties. To date,
almost 3,000 articles on LSD have been published in scientific
journals, although many of these reports do not meet adequate
scientific standards. </p>

<p>106. LSD was developed in 1938 by Hofmann and Stoll, in
Switzerland, as part of a research programme investigating
potential therapeutic uses of certain ergot compounds. LSD is a
semi-synthetic derivative of lysergic acid, an ergot alkaloid
produced by a parasitic fungus, or 'rust', sometimes found on rye
or other grains. Closely related substances are also produced in
the seeds of certain varieties of morning glory. Most ergot
alkaloids are not particularly psychoactive, although some may
have a variety of powerful, and often toxic, physiological
actions, and have been used for centuries for medical purposes. </p>

<p>107. Since LSD appeared to be relatively uninteresting,
physiologically, in animal studies, it received little attention
until Hofmann unwittingly ingested a minute quantity some years
after its original synthesis. He subsequently described his
experience as follows:102 </p>

<p>In the afternoon of 16 April 1943, when I was working on this
problem, I was seized by a peculiar sensation of vertigo and
restlessness. Objects, as well as the shape of my associates in
the laboratory, appeared to undergo optical change. I was unable
to concentrate on my work. In a dreamlike state I left for home,
where an irresistible urge to lie down overcame me. I drew the
curtains and immediately fell into a peculiar state similar to
drunkenness, characterized by an exaggerated imagination. With my
eyes closed, fantastic pictures of extraordinary plasticity and
intensive colour seemed to surge towards me. After two hours this
state gradually wore off. </p>

<p>To confirm his suspicion that LSD was responsible for this
effect, Hofmann investigated further: </p>

<p>However, I decided to get to the root of the matter by taking
a definite quantity of the compound in question. Being a cautious
man, I started my experiment by taking 0.25 mg of d-lysergic acid
diethylamide tartrate, thinking that such an extremely small dose
would surely be harmless, and bearing in mind that the natural
ergot alkaloids produce toxic symptoms in man only with doses
exceeding several milligrams. After 40 minutes I noted the
following symptoms in my laboratory journal: slight giddiness,
restlessness, difficulty in concentration, visual disturbances,
laughing. </p>

<p>And later: </p>

<p>I lost all count of time. I noticed with dismay that my
environment was undergoing progressive changes. My visual field
wavered and everything appeared deformed as in a faulty mirror.
Space and time became more and more disorganized and I was
overcome by a fear that I was going out of my mind. The worst
part of it being that I was clearly aware of my condition. My
power of observation was unimpaired. . . . Occasionally I felt as
if I were out of my body. I thought I had died. My ego seemed
suspended somewhere in space, from where I saw my dead body lying
on the sofa.... It was particularly striking how acoustic
perceptions, such as the noise of water gushing from a tap or the
spoken word, were transformed into optical illusions. I then fell
asleep and awakened the next morning somewhat tired but otherwise
feeling perfectly well. </p>

<p>108. Since various aspects of the experience were thought to
resemble symptoms of naturally occurring schizophrenia, many
investigators became interested in using LSD as a tool for
producing an artificial or 'model psychosis' in the laboratory.
The possibility of gaining insight into psychiatric disorders by
the study of the LSD-induced state stimulated considerable
activity in medical and scientific communities, and the terms <i>psychotomimetic
</i>(psychosis-mimicking) and <i>psychotogenic </i>(psychosis-producing)
were coined. The subsequent discovery that the LSD experience is,
in fact, generally different from natural psychoses has lessened
interest in this aspect of its use. The descriptive label <i>hallucinogenic
</i>(hallucination-producing) has gained wide acceptance, in
spite of the fact that true hallucinations do not commonly occur
with LSD. The term <i>illusinogenic</i> (illusion-producing) is
probably more appropriate. </p>

<p>In the 1950s the exploration of LSD as an aid to psychotherapy
began. Much of the early work, in Canada, investigating the use
of LSD in the treatment of alcoholics, was conducted under the
direction of Dr A. Hoffer at the University of Saskatchewan, In
1957, after reviewing the various descriptive names given LSD and
related drugs, Dr H. Osmond, then Superintendent of the
Saskatchewan Hospital, suggested the terms <i>psycholytic </i>(mind-releasing)
or <i>psychedelic </i>(mind-manifesting) as more appropriate
general labels.174 For various reasons the latter has gained
world-wide usage, although its common application has strayed
considerably from its original context, and it may now denote
general styles of art, fashion and music which are, in some
sense, felt to reflect, enhance, or substitute for the
psychedelic drug experience. </p>

<p>109. While LSD has had a rather short, and somewhat stormy
history, numerous naturally occurring substances with apparently
similar psychological effects have been used in the Western
Hemisphere for centuries. Perhaps the most widely known are
mescaline, from the peyote cactus (lophophora williamsii),
psilocybin, one of the active principles in 'sacred mushrooms'
(teonanactl), and the Mexican morning-glory 'ololiuqui' (Rivea
Corymbosa). In addition, DMT (dimethyltryptamine) and the related
DET (diethyltryptamine) are found in special snuffs used for
centuries by certain South American Indians. Some of these
botanical substances were considered divine by the ancient Aztecs
and played an important role in religious ceremonies long before
the Spanish invaded the land. In spite of the Conquistadors'
attempts to destroy the culture and its historical and religious
underpinnings, the sacramental use of peyote spread to the
Mexican Indians and, later, in the nineteenth century to certain
North American tribes. Today, peyote is used in religious
ceremonies by the Native American Church which has over 200,000
Indian members in Canada and the United States. </p>

<p>110. Until recently, psychedelic drugs received little general
public attention, even though some had been intensively explored
over the past century by various writers, scientists and
'adventurers'. Based on his mescaline experimentation, Aidous
Huxley106 presented, in his twin volumes <i>The Doors of
Perception</i> and<i> Heaven and Hell, </i>one of the most lucid
and perceptive analyses of some of the possible personal,
philosophical and social implications of the psychedelic
experience. </p>

<p>Non-medical interest in LSD and related drugs began to grow
during the 1950s, although such use was apparently largely
restricted to a few professional, academic, and artistic
experimenters. The drug gained continental notoriety in the early
1960s as a result of experimentation by two Harvard University
psychology professors, Drs Alpert and Leary, who invited other
'explorers' to 'Turn on, tune in, and drop out' of the existing
social institutions. Their unorthodox religious orientation to
the LSD experience is presented in <i>The Psychedelic Experience</i>128<i>
</i>(a manual based on the <i>Tibetan Book of the Dead), </i>which
became one of the 'bibles' of the psychedelic drug movement.
Another significant influence, with considerably less religious
orientation was writer Ken Kesey's group, the adventures of which
are well documented in <i>The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test</i>
.247 </p>

<p>111. Since 1963, the Canadian Government has controlled the
medical and scientific use of LSD, and in 1969 the possession of
LSD without governmental authorization was made a criminal
offence. Regulation of the legal supply of LSD has apparently had
little effect on 'street' use, however, since essentially all of
the drug so used has come from clandestine laboratories. Although
the constituent chemicals are not readily available and some
sophisticated apparatus is necessary for its proper synthesis,
LSD can be produced by individuals without extensive training in
chemistry. Since it is odourless, colourless and tasteless in
solution, and active in almost invisible quantities, effective
legal control of its transportation, distribution and use has
been extremely difficult. </p>

<p>In recent years, several new synthetic drugs with effects
similar to LSD have appeared on the black market. These include
MDA (alphamethyl-3,4-methylene - dioxyphenethylamine), STP or DOM
(2,5-ditnethoxy-4-methyl-amphetamine), and PCP or Sernyl*
(phencyclidine). </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Medical
Use </h3>

<p>112. There is currently no widely accepted medical use of LSD,
although it may be employed experimentally for therapeutic
purposes. There have been numerous impressive reports of LSD
successes in the treatment of alcoholics, opiate narcotic
dependents, criminals and various psychiatric patients.101, 129
LSD has also been used with patients dying of cancer, to
alleviate their anxiety and pain, and to help them adjust to the
prospects of death.176 Many of these leads have not been followed
up with adequate scientific investigation, however, and several
recent controlled studies have not substantiated the claim that
LSD adds to the effectiveness of conventional psychotherapy.205 </p>

<p>113. Two basic forms of psychological treatment with LSD have
developed: <i>psycholytic </i>therapy, which uses small or
moderate doses on repeated occasions, sometimes over a period of
several months; and <i>psychedelic </i>therapy which calls for
higher doses and a more profound acute effect and is, as a rule,
given only once or twice. While some investigators claim that
LSD, itself, is more effective than psychotherapy, others claim
that its usefulness is mainly limited to the removal of
therapeutic 'blocks' which may occur at times in the course of
psychotherapy, and still others feel that LSD has no useful
contribution to make to psychiatric treatment. Most clinicians
who have had experience with this form of therapy, stress the
need for a careful selection of patients and for special
qualities and experience in the therapist. </p>

<p>More sophisticated scientific investigations of possible
therapeutic uses of LSD are now underway and may help clarify
some of these issues. It seems justified to say at this time,
however, that the general medical effectiveness of LSD has not
yet been adequately demonstrated. It may well be another decade
before definitive evidence will be available. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Administration,
Absorption, Distribution and Physiological Fate </h3>

<p>114. LSD is usually taken orally, and may be sniffed in
powdered form or injected in solution. While it is available in
ordinary capsules or tablets, LSD is often impregnated in such
innocuous substances as sugar cubes, candies, biscuits, and cloth
or blotter sections for oral use. It is well absorbed from the
gastro-intestinal tract, is distributed in the blood and easily
diffuses into the brain, and in pregnant females crosses the
placental barrier into the foetus. Although only a tiny portion
actually reaches the central nervous system, LSD is one of the
most potent biologically active substances known and, in some
individuals, exerts a noticeable psychological effect with
quantities as low as 20 to 30 micrograms (millionths of a gram).
Customary doses are usually around 200 mcg and some individuals
have taken up to several thousand micrograms. </p>

<p>Taken orally, LSD effects usually occur within an hour but may
be much faster; response to intramuscular injection usually
appears within ten minutes; and if the intravenous route is used,
the latency may be only a few minutes or less. The duration of
the action depends to a certain extent on the amount taken, and
with a customary dose, major effects usually last 8-12 hours or
more with gradual recovery over a similar period. Essentially all
of the LSD in the body is metabolized into an inactive substance
in the liver and excreted. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Psychological
Effects </h3>

<p>115. The psychological effects of LSD are not readily
predictable, and are determined to a considerable degree by
various personality factors in the individual, his past history
and experiences, his attitudes, expectations, and motivations,
the general setting in which the drug is taken, persons
accompanying the 'trip' and external events occurring during the
experience. While the psychological response is to some extent
dose-related, certain effects appear to be relatively independent
of dose over a considerable range. Increased quantities often
seem to affect the duration more than the intensity or quality of
the 'trip'. </p>

<p>116. Subjective psychological effects of LSD are extremely
difficult to describe and many scientists are quite pessimistic
about the possibility of presenting an objective list of
responses which in any way communicates the essence of the
experience. The intensely personal nature of the effects further
limits description and generalization. Pahnke and Richards177
have described several major types of psychological experience
which have been reported with psychedelic drugs. The outline
presented below is based on, but is not identical to, that
proposed by these researchers. While the list is certainly not
exhaustive and does not describe necessarily discrete or
non-overlapping categories, it provides a convenient basis for
the discussion of LSD effects. It should be noted that not all of
the experiences listed happen in all sessions or in all
individuals, although several may occur in varying degrees, in
sequence or simultaneously, within a 'trip'. </p>

<p>117. First is the <i>psychotic adverse reaction, </i>or
'freak-out' which may be characterized by an intense negative
experience of fear or nightmarish terror to the point of panic,
complete loss of emotional control, paranoid delusions,
hallucinations, catatonic features, and, perhaps, profound
depression and sense of meaninglessness. Such states are usually
acute, although pro1onged reactions have been noted. </p>

<p>118. Second is the <i>non-psychotic adverse reaction </i>in
which the person may experience varying degrees of tension,
anxiety and fear, unpleasant illusions, depression and despair.
Inappropriate or disordered social behaviour may occur. This kind
of reaction may differ from the first in the intensity of the
experience and in the degree of control and 'reality contact'
expressed by the individual. Such unpleasant experiences are
commonly labelled 'bad trips' or 'bummers'. </p>

<p>119. Third is the <i>psychodynamic psychedelic experience </i>characterized
by a dramatic emergence into consciousness of material which had
previously been unconscious or suppressed. Strong emotional
feelings can accompany what may be experienced subjectively as a
reliving of incidents from the past or a symbolic portrayal of
important conflicts. Such effects are often sought in LSD
psychotherapy. </p>

<p>120. Fourth is the <i>cognitive psychedelic experience </i>characterized
by an impression of astonishingly lucid thought. Problems may be
seen from a novel perspective and the interrelationships of many
levels of meaning and dimensions may be sensed simultaneously.
The relationship between this experience and naturally occurring
insight and creativity has been the subject of considerable
interest and speculation. </p>

<p>121. Fifth is the <i>aesthetic psychedelic experience </i>characterized
by a change and intensification of all sensory impressions, with
vision often most affected. Fascinating alteration in sensation
and perception may occur; <i>synaesthesia </i>or crossing-over of
sensory modalities may be produced (music and other sounds may be
'seen'); objects such as flowers or stones may appear to pulsate
or 'become alive'; ordinary things may seem imbued with great
beauty; music may take on an incredible emotional power; and
visions of beautiful colours, intricate geometric patterns,
architectural forms, landscapes and 'almost anything imaginable'
may occur. </p>

<p>122. The sixth type of psychedelic experience has been called
by such names as <i>psychedelic-peak, cosmic, transcendental, or
mystical. </i>Some of the psychological phenomena which are said
to characterize this experience, are: a sense of unity or 'cosmic
oneness' with the universe; a feeling of transcendence of time
and space; a deeply felt positive mood of joy, blessedness, love,
and peace; a sense of sacredness,<b> </b>awe and, wonder; a
feeling of profound theological or religious awareness; a feeling
of insight into reality at an intuitive, nonrational level; an
awareness of things which seem logically contradictory and
paradoxical; and a belief that the experience is beyond words,
non-verbal and impossible to describe. The full peak experience,
in its entirety, does not occur in the majority of individuals,
is usually transient, and does not last for long in its full
intensity, although it may have persisting effects on attitudes
and behaviour. </p>

<p>123. With few exceptions, little general information can be
given as to the relative frequency of occurrence of these various
types of psychedelic drug reaction, since the response is largely
determined by such variable factors as the particular individual
involved, his set and the setting. As is often the case in
science, techniques designed to measure the effects of LSD may
greatly influence or distort the phenomenon under study.
Savage198 has pointed out that unless the LSD experience takes
place '. . .<b> </b>in a secure setting, with sufficient
emotional support where S (the subject) feels safe to encounter
the bizarre and often powerful manifestations of his own mind
unharassed by tests, interpretations, and the coldly precise
scientific analytic attitudes, the only result can be confusion
and paranoia'. </p>

<p>Reports of 'objective' study of LSD's subjective effects
considerably in content and often appear to be as much a function
of the individual scientist's conceptual orientation and
experimental methods as they are of the subjects and the drug
itself. Some researchers report that LSD experiences in their
subjects, are definitely unpleasant and anxiety-ridden, and that
subsequent sessions are uniformly avoided, while other scientists
claim that anxiety is infrequent and that subjects generally
enjoy the sessions and are eager to participate further.228
Experiences in non-supervised and indiscriminate settings are
undoubtedly even more variable. </p>

<p>124. It is generally reported that LSD has deleterious effects
on performance in tests requiring a high degree of attention,
concentration or motivation. It is often difficult to get
meaningful data from such measurements, since subjects frequently
become engrossed in the subjective aspects of the drug experience
and lose interest in the tasks presented by the investigators.
Psychological tests are often seen as absurd or irrelevant by the
subjects. Performance on standard tests of intelligence,
learning, memory and other cognitive functions, as well as
certain psychomotor tasks generally show impairment and sometimes
lack of change and, rarely, improvement.205 Certain types of
conduct by some persons under the influence of LSD indicate gross
impairment of judgement. Recall of events occurring during the
drug experience is generally good, however. Effects on driving
skills have not been systematically investigated, although
available related data, and reports by users, as well as certain
eye witness accounts, suggest that driving ability is usually
drastically reduced by the acute effects of LSD. There is no
evidence that the drug has been a significant factor in
automobile accidents, however. </p>

<p>True hallucinations, where false sensory signals are believed
to be physically real, are rarely reported, although
pseudohallucinations and other perceptual distortions and
illusions are frequently noted. One of the most uniformly cited
and significant subjective effects is the alteration of ordinary
temporal perception, or time-sense. Moments may seem like hours,
and time may seem to be transcended. Pleasant experiences may
extend indefinitely or, on the other hand, bad trips can become
an interminable horror. </p>

<p>125. Current arguments as to whether LSD is truly
'consciousness-expanding' as its proponents contend or
'consciousness-constricting' as its opponents assert, will
probably not be resolved by science in the near future, since it
seems unlikely that such hypotheses can be put to adequate
empirical test given the current state of technology. </p>

<p>Contentions are often made that LSD can elicit new levels of
spontaneity, insight, problem-solving and creativity.214 These
claims are very difficult to assess, since the effects described
are often highly subjective and personal, and are hardly amenable
to empirical validation. The problems of studying creativity in
the laboratory are considerable, and little is known of the basic
psychology of such cognitive processes. A generally agreed upon
definition of the concept of creativity has eluded investigators
so far, and few meaningful tests are available. Studies of the
effects of psychedelic drugs on allegedly creativity-related
behaviours have produced inconsistent results. Often performance
does not reflect the subjective impressions of the drug
experience. Although sophisticated scientific investigation in
this area is only just beginning, it is already obvious that LSD
will not perform the miracle of turning an uninspired and
untalented individual into a creative genius. The question of
more subtle effects on creative activity in certain individuals
must be answered by future research. </p>

<p>126. Most authorities agree that LSD does not have a specific
aphrodisiac or sex-drive stimulating effect. Some users indicate
an enhanced appreciation of sexual experience, while many others
report a total disinterest in sex while on a 'trip'. Some
increase in sexual behaviour may occur as a result of a lessening
of inhibitions and an increase in emotionality, tactile
appreciation, and interpersonal contact. LSD has been used in the
treatment of sexual disorders of psychological origin (e.g.
frigidity and impotence) although its general usefulness has not
been clearly demonstrated in this area. </p>

<p>127. An LSD-induced 'bad trip' may range from a mildly
negative or ambivalent experience to an episode of intense terror
and nightmarish panic. Such adverse reactions often seem to focus
on the fear of death, fear of permanent insanity, basic sexual
conflicts, and fear of legal repercussions in illicit users, or
may be precipitated by an objective 'hassle' or problem of real
or imagined significance. Under the influence of LSD, it is often
difficult to cope with immediate problems which arise, and
emotional vulnerability may be increased. 'Bad trips' seem to
occur most often when the individual is poorly prepared, alone,
or in an otherwise unprotected or unsupervised setting. While an
experienced 'guide' or therapist can often help prevent or
alleviate negative reactions, this is no guarantee against an
unpleasant experience. Neither are earlier positive experiences -
severe 'bad trips' have been noted in individuals who had
previous long histories of unequivocally pleasant psychedelic
experiences. Certain tranquillizers can be of assistance in
reducing the unpleasantness of the experience, often by
terminating the drug effect<b> </b>non-chemical, personal
supportive guidance is most important in treating negative
reactions. </p>

<p>Although most negative LSD experiences appear to be of short
duration, prolonged psychotic episodes lasting months or even
years have been elicited by LSD.50 Many investigators contend
that such extreme experiences occur only in individuals already
predisposed to psychotic reaction, and are simply precipitated by
the stress of a 'bad trip'. On the other hand, numerous examples
have occurred in persons without obvious prior pathology, and it
would appear that there is no satisfactory method for predicting
who might suffer a serious adverse reaction. </p>

<p>128. Prolonged psychoses are quite rare in clinical or
experimental settings, even when psychiatric patients are used as<b>
</b>subjects. Cohen49 surveyed 44 investigators who had given LSD
or mescaline to approximately 5,000 persons a total of about
25,000 times, and found that psychotic reactions lasting over 48
hours occurred in 0.18 per cent of the psychiatric patients
studied and 0.08 per cent of the experimental subjects. There
were four suicides in the patients, all occurring months after
the LSD experience, and none among the experimental subjects.
Whether these deaths can be attributed to LSD use is not certain.
Similar incidents of adverse reaction under controlled
circumstances have been reported by others and the use of LSD in
medically supervised settings has been considered by many
investigators to be comparatively safe from a psychiatric point
of view.65, 132 </p>

<p>These findings do not provide a<b> </b>satisfactory basis for
estimating the effects of illicit use, however, since set,
setting, purity and quantity of drug, and consequently, the
quality of the trip, are all apt to be quite different in these
situations. The frequency of bad trips among street LSD users is
unknown, although many such cases have come to the attention of
medical authorities and certainly cannot be considered uncommon.
Solursh2l3 reports that in one series of street users studied
retrospectively, 'freak-outs' occurred in 24 of 601 'acid trips',
Furthermore, impressionistic accounts from individuals in close
contact with the 'drug-scene' suggest that the incidence of 'bad
trips' is steadily increasing. Ungerleider229 studied 70
individuals who required hospitalization in a Los Angeles Medical
centre after illicit LSD use. One-third of these admissions were
diagnosed psychotic and two-thirds were hospitalized for more
than a month. </p>

<p>129. Usually neither the therapist nor the patient is certain
as to the identity, purity or quantity of the drug involved in
'street' cases and records are further complicated by the fact
that there is considerable discrepancy among reporters as to what
exactly constitutes an adverse reaction. Furthermore, it would
appear that many 'bad trips' are treated by friends and never
come to the attention of the medical authorities. In addition to
personal support and assistance in these situations,
tranquillizers (and niacinamide) are available legally and on the
black market for such emergencies. Even if some accurate estimate
could be made of the number of negative reactions occurring, it
would not be possible to assess the relative significance of the
figures, since we have little idea as to the overall frequency of
illicit LSD use in the general population. </p>

<p>130. Illicit users of LSD commonly voice the opinion that bad
trips are caused by bad drugs and that 'pure acid' is relatively
free from adverse reactions. These claims are rarely based on
chemical analysis, and although contaminants and other drugs
reported to appear in black market LSD can undoubtedly affect the
experience, it is uncertain what proportion of the negative
reactions can be accounted for by contaminants. It is certain
that well-documented 'freak-outs' have occurred with clinically
pure LSD. </p>

<p>131. Although suicide may be rare among illicit as well as
medically supervised LSD users, a few cases have been documented.
Attempts at self-mutilation have also been reported on rare
occasions. Accidental deaths are somewhat more common and a
number of cases of fatality or serious injury have been noted as
a result of a loss of critical judgement or attentional
processes. For example, some individuals have jumped from
buildings or trees apparently under the delusion that they could
fly<b> </b>or were indestructible. Stories of numerous persons
who had become permanently blind while staring at the sun during
LSD trips were generated by a state official in the United States
and widely circulated in the public media. These reports were
subsequently shown to be a hoax and no such cases are on
record.170'b' </p>

<p>132. Although fear, panic and aggression may result from a
'freak-out', homicides associated with LSD use are rare and only
a few have been documented. Reports of violence occurring while
under the influence of LSD have generally not been supported,78
although there may be some significant exceptions. The majority
of non-drug arrests associated with LSD use seem to be in the
order of 'disturbance of the peace' offences and there is little
evidence that LSD plays a significant role in major crimes. </p>

<p>Recurrence of certain aspects of LSD experiences ('flashbacks'
or 'echoes') of varying duration and intensity have been reported
over periods ranging from a few months to more than a year after
last (or only) LSD use.189 The quality of these experiences,
which usually last only a few minutes or less, may depend on as
many factors as the original trip. They may be triggered or
precipitated by seemingly irrelevant stimuli or events, by other
drugs, or may appear spontaneously. We have no good information
as to frequency of these recurrences, although they appear to
occur most often in heavy users and could clearly be unpleasant
or dangerous in certain circumstances. </p>

<p>133. The possible religious significance of psychedelic drug
experiences has been the subject of heated controversy for
centuries. While many authorities have pointed out basic
similarities between drug-induced feelings of transcendental or
mystical awareness and the <i>satori or kensho </i>of Zen
Buddhism, <i>the samadhi </i>of Hinduism or the <i>beatific
vision </i>of Christianity, others have been outraged<b> </b>by
the suggestion that such 'instant mysticism' could be produced
chemically. It is quite apparent, however, that a considerable
degree of religiosity has pervaded the psychedelic drug movement
of the 1960s and has played a major role in the use of such drugs
in other cultures. </p>

<p>The major theoretical positions and scientific research in
this area have been reviewed by several investigators208, l47 and
these reports provide experimental support for the notion that
drug-evoked experiences may have religious significance for
certain individuals. Perhaps the most rigorous scientific
evidence comes from Pahnke's175 controlled psilocybin experiment
with seminary graduate students conducted in the setting of a
Good Friday religious service. He notes that: 'Those subjects who
received psilocybin experienced phenomena which were
indistinguishable from, if not identical with, the categories
defined by our typology of mysticism.' The religious aspects of
the psychedelic experience apparently depend a great deal on the
individual, his values and expectations, and the setting
involved, and do not normally occur with great intensity in most
persons or in most situations. Masters and Houstonl47 report that
6 out of 206 of their subjects attained a mystical experience,
while other researchers report no such events and still others, a
much higher incidence. Differences in semantic meaning,
definition and criteria may account for part of these
discrepancies. The 'objective validity' of drug-elicited
religious experiences, however, is by nature untestable in the
scientific sense, and the area will doubtless remain in a storm
of controversy. </p>

<p>134. Numerous claims have been made by various LSD users,
psychotherapists and scientists that LSD can produce long-lasting
beneficial effects on personality and behaviour. On the other
hand, many observers feel that chronic use of LSD may result in a
lessening of work output and a deterioration of social behaviour,
a general 'amotivational syndrome' in some individuals. Both
types of allegation are difficult to evaluate, since few
adequately controlled investigations have been done on the
long-term effects of either medically supervised or non-medical
LSD use. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Physiological
Effects </h3>

<p>135. LSD exerts its most significant physiological effects on
and through the central nervous system, although the exact
mechanism by which this occurs is not yet known. As a result of
its potent general arousal or activation capacity. LSD may
produce a variety of autonomic nervous system (sympathomimetic)
actions, considered to be of little clinical significance at
normal doses. Commonly reported are: widened pupils, increased
heart rate and blood pressure, sweating, increased body
temperature, chills, increased blood sugar level, 'goose
pimples', flushing of the facial skin, increased urination,
headache, and rarely nausea and vomiting. It generally increases
the activation of the brain (as indicated by the EEG), produces
alertness, blocks sleep, decreases appetite, may induce tremors
and reduce coordination, changes respiration patterns, and
facilitates certain simple reflexes.138 In a few instances
convulsions have occurred. LSD has remarkably low physiological
toxicity and, to date, no human deaths have been reported due to
overdose. Although the evidence is not clear, psychological
indications of minor brain damage may be present in chronic heavy
users of LSD.152 </p>

<p>l36. In the past few years, considerable controversy and
sensational publicity has arisen around the possibility that LSD
may affect hereditary transmission through chromosomal
alterations, produce changes in white blood cells resembling
leukemia and adversely affect the developing human focus.48
Relevant studies involving test-tube preparations of human live
animal and insect experiments, and examinations of illicit LSD
users, have been contradictory to date and provide no clear
answers to these important questions.105 The relationship between
<i>in vitro </i>(test-tube) and <i>in vivo </i>(living organism)
effects is rarely straightforward, and generalizations from one
species to another are difficult. Furthermore, studying the users
of 'street' drugs gives little information regarding specific
compounds, since such individuals may use a variety of drugs and
neither the investigator nor the subject can be sure of the
purity, quantity or identity of substances obtained from the
illicit market. In the few controlled studies in which
chromosomes were examined in humans before and after clinically
supervised administration of known doses of pure LSD, little
evidence of significant change was noted.125,58 The effects of
prolonged regular use of LSD have not been carefully
investigated, however, and the presence or absence of alterations
under such conditions can not be completely predicted on the
basis of present information. </p>

<p>Research in this area is complicated by the fact that
temporary or permanent chromosome breakage is not an uncommon
response to a variety of non-drug experiences, and can be
produced by nuclear radioactivity, many pollutants, X-rays, fever
and a number of virus infections. Furthermore, there is evidence
that such frequently used drugs as caffeine and aspirin may cause
chromosome breaks in certain cells.122 It should be noted that
chromosome damage <i>per se </i>does not necessarily affect
either the individual or his offspring, although the possibility
must be considered. </p>

<p>137. High doses of LSD administered at certain times early in
pregnancy have been shown to produce deformities in the offspring
of some animal species and not others. No unequivocal evidence of
such teratogenic LSD effects in humans has been reported,
although there have been a few widely publicized instances of
abnormalities in babies born of mothers who had used LSD. Whether
such anomalies occur more frequently in LSD users than in the
normal population is uncertain. Most investigators feel that the
possibility of chromosome or foetal damage in humans forbids the
use of LSD for either medical or non-medical purposes, by women
who are either pregnant or expect to become so in the near
future. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Tolerance
and Dependence </h3>

<p>138. Tolerance to the psychological and physiological effects
of LSD develops on repeated use, although the form of
psychological tolerance is unusual in several respects. Tolerance
to most drugs can be overcome and effects of full intensity
obtained by simply increasing dosage. With LSD, often a period of
three or four days or longer must separate 'trips' if the full
effects are to be obtained, regardless of dose. A second unusual
quality of LSD tolerance is the rapidity with which it develops
and dissipates. A reduction in effects may occur after only one
or two consecutive administrations. Furthermore, when LSD is used
intermittently many users report, a 'reverse' tolerance, or
increased sensitivity to the drug and may, after experience, use
less to achieve the desired effects. These factors suggest that
the pharmacological mechanism underlying LSD tolerance may be
quite different from those seen with most other psychoactive
drugs. </p>

<p>139. Physical dependence does not develop to LSD, even in
cases in which the drug has been used more than two hundred times
in a single year.51 Psychological dependence has been reported to
occur in certain individuals who become preoccupied with the drug
experience and feel emotionally depressed and unsatisfied without
it. Normally, however, LSD use is intermittent and periods of
weeks or months may separate 'trips' in even 'confirmed' users, </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">LSD
and Other Drugs </h3>

<p>140. It appears that many LSD users will also experiment with
other psychedelic drugs. Cross-tolerance occurs among some of
these substances and an individual who has recently taken LSD
will generally show reduced response to mescaline and psilocybin,
but not to cannabis or phencyclidine (PCP). It should be noted
that mescaline and psilocybin are rarely found in Canada and no
such black market samples have been verified by chemical
analysis. </p>

<p>Other drugs, such as atropine or amphetamines, are reported to
be sometimes added to LSD to intensify, prolong or otherwise
alter the experience. Strychnine (a stimulant once commonly used
in medical practice) is rumoured to have also been employed for
such effects. In spite of such stories, black market products
purported to contain mixtures of LSD and other drugs have rarely
been found on analysis to be as represented. Such combinations
appear to be infrequent in Canada. Unsuccessful attempts at LSD
synthesis may produce a variety of other ergot alkaloids with
possibly unpleasant or dangerous pharmacological properties in
high doses. Samples of such concoctions have been obtained from
black market sources.144 </p>

<p>Chlorpromazine (Largactil*), a major tranquillizer, usually
blocks LSD effects, although in rare instances it paradoxically
potentiates the original drug response. In addition certain
sedatives and niacinamide (nicotinamide) may also reduce some of
the effects of LSD. </p>

<p>141.<i> Cannabis sativa </i>is an herbaceous annual plant
which readily grows untended in temperate climates in many areas
of the world, including Canada. Although there are several
varieties (i.e. indica, americana, and africana) most botanists
consider these to be members of the same species. Indian hemp, as
this plant is sometimes known, has separate male and female forms
and may grow to 10 to 12 feet under favourable conditions. </p>

<p>The first detailed description of cannabis available today
appeared in a medicinal book prepared by the Chinese Emperor Shen
Nung around 2737 B.C. Since then, cannabis has been known in the
East by such descriptions as 'the heavenly guide', 'Poor man's
heaven', 'soother of grief' and, in a more moralistic tone, 'the
liberator of sin'.223 A United Nations' report 20 years ago
estimated that 200 million people in the world used the drug for
medical, religious or recreational purposes. </p>

<p>142. What is commonly referred to as marijuana ('grass',
'pot', 'weed', 'tea', 'boo' or 'Mary Jane') in North America is
usually made up of crushed cannabis leaves, flowers, and often
twigs, and may vary considerably in potency from one sample to
another. Similar preparations are known as <i>bhang </i>and the
more potent <i>ganja </i>in India, <i>kif </i>in Morocco and <i>dagga
</i>in Africa, while the relatively pure resin is called <i>hashish
</i>('hash') in the West and much of the Middle East, and <i>charas
</i>in India. Hashish is usually prepared by pressing or scraping
the sticky amber resin from the plant, and may be more than five
times as potent on a weight basis as high quality marijuana. In
addition to these common forms, concentrated cannabis extract is
available in some countries in an alcohol solution (tincture of
Cannabis) designed for medical purposes (e.g., British
Pharmacopoeia). </p>

<p>The various forms of the drug are frequently listed under the
general term cannabis since they differ primarily in the degree
of potency. It must be stressed, however; that differences in the
preparation, quantities involved, mode of administration and
patterns of use are also important determinants of effect, and it
is often essential that these factors be identified in the
examination of individual reports. </p>

<p>143. In many societies, <i>cannabis sativa </i>has been a
highly valued crop. The trunk fibres of the woody plant are used
in the reduction of hemp rope and twine; the seeds are a source
of a product similar to linseed oil and, until recently, were
also commonly used as bird food; the pharmacological properties
of the leaves, flowers and resin have been used for thousands of
years, for both medical and non-medical purposes. </p>

<p>Cannabis was apparently brought to the Western hemisphere in
the sixteenth century by the Spaniards and was an important fibre
and seed crop centuries later in the British colonies of North
America. A portion of George Washington's Mount Vernon plantation
was dedicated to the cultivation of hemp and it was reported
that, 'Virginia awarded bounties for hemp culture and
manufacture, and imposed penalties on those who did not produce
it.'31 Although there are conflicting opinions, it would appear
that the psychotropic properties of cannabis may have been little
known to the colonial farmers at that time.12,120 Hemp was again
cultivated in North America during World War II after the major
supply lines from the East were cut off. These plants were
apparently selected for high fibre content and low
pharmacological activity. </p>

<p>144. When grown under optimal conditions almost all parts of
both male and females plants, may be potentially psychoactive.
The female has traditionally been considered the more efficient
producer of the resin responsible for the pharmacological
effects, although recent studies question this conclusion.235
Female flowers, prior to pollination, contain the greatest
concentration of resin and, consequently, the flowering tops are
highly valued and are frequently prepared separately from the
remainder of the plant. The potency is further affected by the
climate and soil conditions, certain genetic factors, and the
time and method of harvesting and preparation. </p>

<p>145. In recent years, the chemistry of cannabis has come under
careful investigation. Although numerous cannabinols were
considered potential candidates in the search for the active
principles of cannabis, it appears that certain forms of
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are the most potent psychoactive
constituents. Several of these have recently been isolated and
synthesized.155 It would be incorrect to say, however, that the
active ingredient in cannabis has been established, since much
basic psychopharmacological work remains to be done in this area.
Several related synthetics (Synhexyl* or Pyrahexyl*) have also
been investigated. Although there are continual reports of THC
being sold on the illicit market, samples alleged to be THC have
invariably been found to be some other drug. </p>

<p>146. Frequent cases of cannabis use first came to the regular
attention of government and public health officials in North
America after World War I, although earlier references to such
use exist. This increase was correlated with an influx of Mexican
workers into the Southern United States, and subsequent use was
apparently largely confined to ethnic minority groups, with a
high proportion of urban-dwelling Afro- and Spanish-Americans
among the known users. In addition, cannabis use was often noted
among musicians and others in the fields of entertainment and
creative arts. In the last decade, however, the use of cannabis
has spread to quite a different segment of the population and
appears to be most prevalent among, although by no means
restricted to, middle-class youth of high school and college age.
In spite of the risk of severe penalties, estimates based on a
variety of sources suggest that eight to 20 million North
Americans have at least tried cannabis.260 These figures must be
considered tenuous however, since there is no satisfactory way to
assess their validity. </p>

<p>147. Recently the controversy surrounding this drug has
reached epidemic proportions. Usually reliable authorities have
publicly taken diametrically opposed positions regarding
cannabis, not only on moral and social policy issues, but on the
supposedly 'hard' scientific facts as well. Although the current
world literature on cannabis numbers some 2,000 publications, few
of these papers meet modern standards of scientific
investigation. They are often ill-documented and ambiguous,
emotion-laden and incredibly biased, and can, in general, be
relied upon for very little valid information. Scientific
expertise in the area of cannabis is limited by the simple fact
that there is little clearly-established scientific information
available, and preconceived notions often dominate the
interpretation of ambiguous data. The resulting confusion is
exemplified by current legislation in many parts of the world,
including Canada and the United States, which classifies cannabis
with the opiate narcotics, even though these drugs are
pharmacologically different. </p>

<p>This rather sorry state of affairs can be attributed to
several factors. To begin with, governmental restrictions on the
medical and scientific use of cannabis in North America have been
so strict over the past few decades that the majority of would-be
researchers have found it more attractive to work in other areas.
Secondly, since the widespread use of cannabis in North America
is a relatively new phenomenon, it has not, in the past, been
considered a particularly high priority research area from a
public health standpoint. In addition, until recently, there was
little possibility of standardizing the cannabis substances being
studied, since little was known about the relevant aspects of
cannabis chemistry. Consequently, there was little basis for
comparing reports, and generalizations were limited. To date, no
authorized experimental research of cannabis effects on humans is
being conducted in Canada. </p>

<p>The observations collected during centuries of relatively
unrestricted cannabis use in regions of the East have rarely been
scientifically documented because most of what we consider modern
science has been, until recently, basically a Western phenomenon.
Furthermore, profound cultural, moral and legal differences
complicate the problem of extrapolating from reports of Eastern
usage to the North American scene. </p>

<p>While there has been a concerted effort, in the following
discussions of cannabis effects, to concentrate attention on
fairly well documented topics and to avoid areas where the
evidence is especially weak, the scanty nature of our current
scientific knowledge of cannabis necessitates a cautious and
tentative approach to this interim review. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Medical
Use </h3>

<p>148. There is no currently accepted medical use of cannabis in
North America outside of an experimental context. Although
cannabis has been reported to produce an array of possibly useful
medical effects, these have either not been adequately
investigated, or can be replaced by using other more readily
available and convenient drugs. The natural product's variability
in potency and instability over time are among the factors which
have led to its disfavour in Western 20th century medicine.
However, recent advances in isolation and synthesis of certain
active principles of cannabis have prompted a second look at some
of the potentially therapeutic aspects of the drug.159 </p>

<p>Cannabis has been used in the past, is presently used in some
cultures, or is currently under clinical investigation, for its
alleged anxiety-reducing, tranquillizing, mood-elevating,
appetite stimulating, analgesic (pain reducing) and
anti-bacterial effects. It has also been used to reduce fatigue
or insomnia (sleeplessness), to ease opiate narcotic withdrawal,
and as an aid to psychotherapy in applications analogous to <i>psycholytic</i>
LSD therapy or as a clinical antidepressant. In addition,
cannabis has often been employed in the past, and is currently
used illicitly in North America, to reduce the secondary symptoms
and suffering caused by the flu and the common cold. These
various alleged therapeutic properties of cannabis have not been
adequately studied in a scientific context, and their general
medical potential remains a matter of conjecture. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Administration,
Absorption, Distribution and Physiological Fate </h3>

<p>149. Marijuana is usually smoked in hand-rolled cigarettes
known as 'joints', 'J's', 'sticks' or 'reefers', the butt of
which is often called a 'roach'. Normally one or two joints is
sufficient to produce a mild 'high', although this varies
considerably according to individual factors and the potency of
the sample. Hashish may vary in colour from very light to
dark-brown and ranges from a hard waxy substance to a crumbly,
powdery consistency. Small pieces of hashish may be placed on the
tip of a burning tobacco cigarette and the smoke inhaled off the
top. Ordinary pipes, water pipes (hookahs) and a variety of
specially made instruments are also employed in the smoking of
hashish and marijuana. </p>

<p>In the Middle East and Far East cannabis is often mixed with
such substances as <i>datura stramonium </i>(Jimson weed),
tobacco, <i>nux vomica, </i>and opium, which further complicates
the interpretation of reports from these areas.107 Samples of
cannabis obtained in Canada generally do not contain other drugs,
although they may be 'cut' with relatively inert substances.143
There have been no analytical reports to support rumours that
heroin or other opiate narcotics have been found in cannabis in
this country. </p>

<p>150. Cannabis smoke is usually inhaled deep into the lungs and
held there for an extended time, in order to increase absorption.
The onset of psychological effects is almost immediate with the
smoking of more potent forms of cannabis, and the peak effects
usually occur within the first quarter-hour following
inhalations. Major effects usually last several hours while
milder ones may endure for half a day longer. </p>

<p>Absorption by the gastro-intestinal tract is effective,
although relatively slow. Since the resin is fairly soluble in
hot water, cannabis is often used in making tea or other
beverages - mild <i>bhang </i>drinks, for example, are common in
India. In some countries hashish is incorporated into buttered
candies called <i>majoon, </i>or other foods. The effects of
cannabis taken orally usually begin after an hour or so, and
gradually reach a peak within several hours, then slowly decline.
Very high doses may produce some effects lasting more than a day,
although the drug is not ordinarily used in such large quantities
in North America. The effects of oral administration are often
noticeably different from those of inhalation. It is uncertain
whether this is due to chemical changes from the heat in the
smoked material, effects of the digestive juices or other
metabolic enzymes after oral administration, or differences in
rapidity and efficiency of absorption and distribution in the two
methods. On a weight basis, however, smoking seems to be the most
effective mode of administration. The speed of acquisition, the
duration of effects, and the recovery from the cannabis 'high'
depends on the rate, quantity, and mode of administration, in
addition to various psychological and physiological
characteristics of the user. </p>

<p>151. While considerable progress is being made in this area,
little is known at the present time regarding the metabolism,
excretion, and mechanism of action of cannabis. There is evidence
that some metabolites of THC are psychoactive. Techniques are
being developed which are designed to measure cannabis products
in the urine, blood and saliva, and substantial breakthroughs are
expected in these areas in the near future. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Effects
of Cannabis </h3>

<p>152. Although the literature is brimming with impressionistic
reports of the effects of cannabis, only a small number of these
meet even the most rudimentary scientific standards. A review of
those effects which have been unequivocally established and
scientifically documented would be a scant summary indeed. In
spite of strong disagreement among extremists on many points in
the cannabis controversy, major governmental reports by
independent- commissions of various backgrounds over
three-quarters of a century have come to some surprisingly
similar conclusions regarding the use of cannabis. Such reports
include the British <i>Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report
(1893-4),</i>107 Mayor La Guardia's Report on <i>The Marijuana
Problem in The City of New York </i>(1944),149 the United States
President's Commission on <i>Law Enforcement</i> <i>and
Administration of Justice: Task Force on Narcotics and Drug Abuse
</i>(1967),220 and the <i>Cannabis </i>report (1968), by the
British Advisory Committee on Drug Dependence, prepared under the
chairmanship of the Baroness Wootton of Abinger.5 </p>

<p>In many areas in which formal scientific data are not
available, we shall have to rely on expert opinion, and in such
instances reference will be made to some of the observations
presented in these aforementioned governmental reports. A general
overview of the effects of cannabis will be followed by a more
detailed examination of certain selected scientific studies.
Primary concern will be given to recent publications. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Overview
of Effects </h3>

<p>153.<i> Physiological</i> <i>Effects. </i>The short-term
physiological effects of cannabis are usually slight and
apparently have little clinical significance. The following
effects have been established in adequately controlled studies:
increase in heart rate, swelling of the minor conjunctival blood
vessels in the membranes around the eye, and minor unspecific
changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Also commonly noted,
but less well documented, are: a slight drying of the eyes and
nasal passages, initially stimulated salivation followed by
dryness of the mouth, throat irritation and coughing during
smoking, and increased urination. Less commonly, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhoea or constipation are reported. These
gastro-intestinal disturbances rarely occur with smoked cannabis,
although nausea is not uncommon when large quantities are taken
orally. Changes in blood sugar level and blood pressure have been
inconsistently reported. Appetite is usually stimulated. Contrary
to popular belief, there is little evidence of pupil dilation. In
some individuals, incoordination, ataxia and tremors have been
observed and chest pains, dizziness and fainting have
occasionally been noted, usually at high doses. Physiological
hangover effects have been described but are rare, even after
considerable intoxication. </p>

<p>154. Cannabis has little acute physiological toxicity - sleep
is the usual somatic consequence of over-dose. No deaths due
directly to smoking or eating of cannabis have been documented
and no reliable information exists regarding the lethal dose in
humans. One fatality, however, was reportedly caused by
distention of the bowel during a prolonged bout of gross
over-eating under the acute influence of cannabis.134 </p>

<p>155. There is little reliable information on the long-term
effects of cannabis use. There are numerous reports from Eastern
countries of chronic ill-health among very heavy long-term users
of hashish. Most commonly reported are minor respiratory and
gastro-intestinal ailments. These studies rarely provide a
control group of comparable non-users for a reference standard,
and clinical findings are usually confounded with a variety, of
social, economic and cultural factors which are not easily
untangled. Consequently, much important work remains to be done
in this area. The British <i>Cannabis </i>report (1968) states: 5
</p>

<p>Having reviewed all the material available to us, we find
ourselves in agreement with the conclusion reached by the Indian
Hemp Drugs Commission appointed by the Government of India
(1893-1894) and the New York Mayor's Committee on Marihuana
(1944), that the long-term consumption of cannabis in <i>moderate
</i>doses has no harmful effects. </p>

<p>156. Some observers have suggested that chronic smoking of
cannabis might produce carcinogenic effects similar to those now
attributed to the smoking of tobacco, although no evidence exists
to support this view at this time. A meaningful comparison is
difficult to make since the quantity of leaf consumed by the
average cigarette smoker in North America is many times the
amount of cannabis smoked by even heavy users. The present
pattern of use by regular cannabis smokers in North America is
more analogous to intermittent alcohol use (e.g., once or twice a
week), than to the picture of chronic daily use presented by
ordinary tobacco dependence. However, the deep inhalation
technique usually used with cannabis might add respiratory
complications. </p>

<p>157. Recently, there have been conflicting reports that large
quantities of cannabis extract, injected into pregnant females of
certain strains of rodents, may cause abnormalities in the
offspring.85 These disparate results can not be simply
extrapolated to humans and at this time there is no scientific
evidence that cannabis adversely affects human chromosomes or
causes deformed children. </p>

<p>158.<i> Psychological Effects</i>.<i> </i>The psychological
effects of cannabis vary greatly with a number of factors and are
often difficult to predict. The dose, type of preparation, and
rate and mode of administration can greatly influence the
response, even if the effective doses and peak responses are made
comparable. Furthermore, the psychological effects depend to a
considerable degree on the personality of the user, his past
experience with cannabis or other drugs, his attitudes, and the
setting in which the drug is used. </p>

<p>Although 'hash' may be many times more potent than marijuana,
the effects of these two forms of cannabis, as usually used in
North America, are often indistinguishable. It has been reported
that most experienced individuals smoke to attain a certain
effect or level of 'high', and adjust the dose according to the
potency of the substance used. 'Grass' and 'hash' are generally
used interchangeably and great variations in potency of different
samples are accommodated by the experienced user through a
'titration' of dose - i.e., intake is stopped when the smoker
reaches a personally comfortable level of intoxication. Such
precision is generally not possible with oral use, however, due
to the long delay in action, and a 'non-optimal' effect is
therefore much more likely to occur with this practice. In some
Eastern countries, different social norms have evolved around the
different forms of cannabis, and the pattern of drug use
associated with bhang drinks may be quite different from that
seen in regular hashish users. Long-term heavy cannabis users
invariably prefer the more potent ganja or hashish.45, 107 </p>

<p>It is often difficult to find descriptions of the
psychological affects of marijuana that are free from value
judgements. Many effects seem to take on good or bad connotations
depending on the circumstances in which they occur, the personal
attitudes of the individual undergoing the experience, and the
orientation of the observer who is recording them. Moreover,
since many of the significant psychological effects are intensely
personal, the laboratory scientist often has little opportunity
to make objective measurements, and must rely on subjective,
introspective reports, communicated verbally through a language
system which is frequently inadequate. </p>

<p>159. Cannabis is one of the least potent of the psychedelic
drugs, and some might object to its being classified with LSD and
similar substances. It is often suggested that marijuana is a
mild intoxicant, more like alcohol.132 There is evidence,
however, that high doses of cannabis in some individuals may
produce effects similar, in some respects, to an attenuated LSD
experience. While such effects are rarely reported, many milder
aspects of the psychedelic experience regularly occur with a
cannabis 'high'. The outline of potential reactions to
psychedelic drugs presented in the section on LSD include: <i>psychotic
and non-psychotic adverse reactions, psychodynamic, cognitive,
aesthetic, and psychedelic-peak (transcendental) or religious
experiences. </i>While analogous experiences may occur in varying
degrees with cannabis, the quality of the effects is reportedly
different, the intensity considerably lower, and the overall
response more controllable than with the more powerful
psychedelic drugs. It would be incorrect to say that cannabis in
moderate dose actually produces a mild LSD experience; the
effects of these two drugs are physiologically, behaviourally and
subjectively quite distinct. Furthermore, since no
cross-tolerance occurs between LSD and THC the mechanism of
action of these two drugs is thought to be different.109 </p>

<p>160. A cannabis 'high' typically involves several phases. The
initial effects are often somewhat stimulating and, in some
individuals, may elicit mild tension or anxiety which usually is
replaced by a pleasant feeling of well-being. The later effects
usually tend to make the user introspective and tranquil. Rapid
mood changes often occur. A period of enormous hilarity may be
followed by a contemplative silence. </p>

<p>Psychological, effects which are typically reported by users
include: happiness, increased conviviality, a feeling of enhanced
interpersonal rapport and communication, heightened sensitivity
to humour, free play of the imagination, unusual cognitive and
ideational associations, a sense of extra-ordinary reality, a
tendency to notice aspects of the environment of which one is
normally unaware, enhanced visual imagery, an altered sense of
time in which minutes may seem like hours, changes in visually
perceived spatial relations, enrichment of sensory experiences
(subjective aspects of sound and taste perception are often
particularly enhanced), increased personal understanding and
religious insight, mild excitement and energy, (or just the
opposite), increased or decreased behavioural activity, increased
or decreased verbal fluency and talkativeness, lessening of
inhibitions, and at higher doses, a tendency to lose or digress
from one's train of thought. Feelings of enhanced spontaneity and
creativity are, often described, although an actual increase in
creativity is difficult to establish scientifically. While most
experts agree that cannabis has little specific aphrodisiac (sex
stimulating) effect, many users report increased enjoyment of sex
and other intimate human contact while under the influence of the
drug.93,161 </p>

<p>Less pleasant, experiences may occur in different individuals,
or possibly in the same individuals at different times. Some of
these reactions may include: fear and anxiety, depression,
irritability, nausea, headache, backache, dizziness, a dulling of
attention, confusion, lethargy, and a sensation of heaviness,
weakness and drowsiness. Disorientation, delusions,
suspiciousness and paranoia, and in some cases, panic, loss of
control, and acute psychotic states have been reported.
Schwarz196 has compiled an extensive catalogue of reports of
adverse symptoms which have been attributed to cannabis in the
world literature. </p>

<p>161. The possibility of psychiatric disorders associated with
cannabis use has received considerable attention. Although there
are some well documented examples of very intense and nightmarish
short-term reactions (usually among inexperienced users in
unpleasant situations and with high doses), these cases seem to
be relatively rare and generally show a rapid recovery. Although
many regular users have had an experience with cannabis which was
in some way unpleasant, 'freak-outs' are apparently rare.
Ungerleider230 has reported 1,887 'adverse reactions' to
marijuana in the Los Angeles area. These data are difficult to
interpret since no clear definition of adverse reaction is
provided and no follow-ups were made. By contrast, Unwin in
Montreal reports:233 </p>

<p>I have seen only three adverse reactions in the past two
years; all following the smoking of large amounts of hashish and
all occurring in individuals with a previous history of
psychiatric treatment for psychiatric or borderline conditions. </p>

<p>The few cases of prolonged psychosis which have been reported
have usually been attributed to an earlier personality
predisposition, although this hypothesis is not always easy to
substantiate. Earlier notions of a specific 'cannabis psychosis'
have generally been abandoned since there is little evidence of
such a distinct psychiatric entity. Smith206 in San Francisco,
reports that he has never observed 'cannabis psychosis' in over
35,000 marijuana users seen at the Haight-Ashbury clinic. But a
recent psychiatric report described several psychotic reactions
occurring in American soldiers in Vietnam, who had used
cannabis.218 The psychiatrist believed that the psychotic
episodes may have been related to cannabis use. This emphasizes
the need for caution before any generalizations about the
evidence of psychiatric complication with cannabis use are made -
particularly in individuals who have consumed large doses of
potent material under conditions of increased physical and
psychological stress. Such general conditions are, of course, by
no means restricted to military operations. </p>

<p>162. There have been a few reports of 'flash-backs' or
spontaneous recurrences of certain cannabis effects some time
after the last use of the drug, although such events are
apparently quite rare. In addition, cannabis has also been
reported to have precipitated LSD recurrences in some heavy users
of LSD.123 </p>

<p>Only a few adequate laboratory investigations have been made
of the effects of cannabis on normal psychological functioning.
Most of the data indicate little change under the conditions
tested, although reports of both impaired and improved
performance have been made. Because of the perceptual, cognitive
and psycho-motor effects often attributed to cannabis, it seems
reasonable to expect that in high doses the drug would impair
automobile driving. Many regular users feel this is so and avoid
driving, while others content that they are more careful and are
probably better drivers when slightly 'high'.93 There is no
available evidence that cannabis has been a significant factor in
traffic accidents. The one study testing cannabis effects on
driving skills found little impairment to be caused by a 'mild
social high'.61 Some of the studies pertinent to these topics
will be discussed in more detail at the end of this section. </p>

<p>163. A study by Suchman217 suggests a close association
between the use of marijuana in some young people and adherence
to what is termed the 'hang-loose' ethic. Central to this notion
is the questioning of such traditional patterns of behaviour and
belief as, conventional religion, marriage, pre-marital chastity
and the accumulation of wealth. Subscribers to this ethic
apparently do not necessarily reject the <i>mores </i>of the
established order, but are strongly critical of them. In this
study, the stronger the student embraced the ethic the more
favourable he was towards marijuana use. Smoking marijuana was
highly associated with 'nonconformist' behaviour such as
participating in mass protests and was more likely to be reported
by those students who were dissatisfied with the education they
were receiving. The 'hang-loose' ethic, while it may represent
antagonism to the conventional world, does not appear to create
apathy and withdrawal. The investigator suggests that the smoking
of marijuana is part of the behaviour associated with this ethic
rather than the cause of it. </p>

<p>A somewhat different view is suggested by McGlothlin and
West154 on the basis of clinical observation. They have described
an 'amotivational syndrome' in some heavy marijuana users in
North America. It is suggested that such use of marijuana may
contribute to some characteristic personality changes including
apathy, loss of effectiveness, diminished capacity or willingness
to carry out complex long-term plans, endure frustration, follow
routines or successfully master new material. The interpretation
of these observations is complicated by the fact that such
individuals are usually involved with other drugs as well as
cannabis. </p>

<p>Several Eastern studies have suggested that chronic high-dose
use of the more potent preparations of cannabis may have
detrimental effects on the individual. One of the most
comprehensive reports was that of the Chopras in 1939.45 An
eight-year study was carried out on a sample of 1,238 cannabis
users. With regard to moderate doses, users of relatively mild
bhang reported a general feeling of well-being, relief from worry
and sharpened appetite. Heavy users were often found to suffer
from several adverse symptoms. In some instances, cannabis use
was seen as an attempt at self-medication in response to theme
disorders rather than as the cause. </p>

<p>The researchers report that among the ganja and charas users,
a small percentage suffered from serious psychiatric disorder,
and minor emotional problems, including impairment of judgement
and memory, were observed in the majority of these subjects.
According to the authors, a significant proportion of the group
had pre-existing neurotic tendencies which may have contributed
to their problem of drug use. Heavy users were often observed to
show marked inactivity, apathy and self-neglect. The majority of
those who took small doses of any of the cannabis preparations
felt that the overall consequences of their drug habit were nil
or beneficial, while the majority of those who chronically took
heavy doses, thought the practice harmful. These subjective
judgements were generally consistent with the clinical
observations reported. </p>

<p>165. This and other reports from Eastern countries are
difficult to interpret and apply to the Western situation. To
begin with, no equivalent data are presented from a comparable
control group of non-users of similar social and economic
background (although some comparisons among users are possible)
and there is no means of estimating the representativeness of the
sample studied. In addition, there are many social and economic
factors which complicate cross-cultural comparisons. The use of
cannabis has a different meaning in Eastern cultures where a long
history and tradition surrounds its use - than it does in the
West, where it is a relatively recent phenomenon. Often, concepts
of normalcy and deviancy differ considerably from one culture to
another. In addition, the Eastern cannabis user generally
consumes larger quantities of more potent forms with greater
frequency than does the Western user. </p>

<p>166. Although the possession of cannabis is a crime, and in
obtaining it an individual must normally come in contact with
other individuals committing drug offences, there is no
scientific evidence that cannabis itself is responsible for the
commission of other forms of criminal behaviour. Chopra and
Chopra45 suggest that cannabis use may, in fact, actually reduce
the occurrence of crime and aggression by decreasing general
activity. While criminals may be more likely to use cannabis than
other individuals, few crimes committed under the influence of
marijuana have been documented, and a casual relationship between
the drug use and other illegal behaviour has not been
established. It may well be that an individual who is inclined to
commit one illegal act (e.g., a drug offence), may also be more
likely than average to transgress in other areas as well. Some
observers feel that the lessening of inhibitions often reported
with cannabis use might, in certain delinquent individuals,
increase the likelihood of asocial behaviour. In a 1967
judgement, rendered by Judge G. Joseph Tauro, Chief Justice of
the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, in the Boston trial of two
men (Leis and Weiss) accused of trafficking cannabis, the
following statement appears:54 </p>

<p>In my opinion, a proper inference may be drawn from the
evidence, that there is a relationship between the use of
marijuana and the incidence of crime and anti-social behaviour. </p>

<p>The brief presented to the Commission by the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police dealt at considerable length with the alleged
association of illegal drug use and criminal behaviour in Canada.
This evidence is discussed later in the report. </p>

<p>The British <i>Cannabis </i>report (1968) states that:5 </p>

<p>In the United Kingdom the taking of cannabis has not so far
been regarded, even by the severest critics, as a direct cause of
serious crime.... The evidence of a link with violent crime is
far stronger with alcohol than with the smoking of cannabis. </p>

<p>167. <i>Tolerance and Dependence. </i>While gross tolerance to
the major effects of cannabis does not seem to occur in humans,
there are many more subtle aspects of this situation which have
yet to be clarified. Although there is little tendency for
intermittent users to increase dose, certain cannabis effects may
be modified by repeated experiences with the drug. Many
investigators have pointed out that in some individuals there
appears to be a 'reverse' tolerance - i.e., smaller doses may
produce the <i>desired </i>effects after the user has become
familiar with the drug. Many individuals experienced little or no
effect the first time they smoked cannabis. Whether this is due
to initially poor smoking technique, some learning or
psychological adaptation process, or perhaps some more molecular
pharmacological sensitization, is uncertain. On the other hand, a
few individuals appear to be extremely sensitive to the effects
of cannabis at the beginning and may initially report intense,
ornate, and perhaps frightening experiences which are rarely, if
ever, equalled in subsequent administrations. </p>

<p>168. Investigators have reported that regular users learn to
direct or control some of the psychological and behavioural
effects while subjectively 'high' and may be able to perform
certain functions better than non-users given the same dose. This
would suggest that some sort of differential selective adaptation
or tolerance may develop to some of the initially
'uncontrollable' effects.User4 remain sensitive to the rewarding
effects of the drug since there is generally no marked
inclination for them to increase dosage. Some users report that
if they stay 'high' for several days in a row the drug experience
loses much of its freshness and clarity and, consequently, they
prefer intermittent use. </p>

<p>There are reports of chronic, heavy users from the East who
consume what would seem to be rather large quantities by Western
standards.24,30 Whether this reflects some degree of tolerance
with heavy use in these users or differences in desired effects
or general drug-using norms, is not known. </p>

<p>169. Physical dependence to cannabis has not been demonstrated
and it would appear that there are normally no adverse<i> </i>physiological
effects or withdrawal symptoms occurring with abstinence from the
drug, even in regular users. On the other hand, there have been
several reports from the Far East and Middle East, of
irritability, mild discomfort, and certain behavioural symptoms
occurring after withdrawal of the drug in chronic heavy users.24
It must be kept in mind that these cases are not clearly
documented and that the purity of the substances involved is not
certain. Since hashish is smoked with large quantities of tobacco
and other drugs in many Eastern countries, these mixtures could
be responsible for the minor withdrawal symptoms reported. </p>

<p>170. No controlled research has been done into the effects of
discontinued cannabis administration after unusually high doses
of the unadulterated substance have been given over a prolonged
length of time. While such an extreme situation may appear to be
of little social significance, it should be noted that physical
dependence on the sedatives (alcohol, barbiturates and
tranquillizers) usually occurs in only a small minority of users
who take abnormally large quantities of the drug for extended
periods of time. </p>

<p>171. The presence or absence of psychological dependence in a
given situation, of course, depends on one's definition of the
term. While many cannabis users in North America seem to take the
drug once or twice a week, in a social context similar to that in
which alcohol is normally consumed, and readily abstain for weeks
or months with no ill effects, there is a small minority of users
who smoke it daily and whose regular routine and sense of
well-being is disrupted if they are unable to obtain the drug.
Most users apparently find the drug pleasant and desirable, and
often will go out of their way to acquire it - even at the risk
of criminal penalty. However, the craving and urgency associated
with opiate narcotic of sedative (or tobacco) dependence do not
seem to occur. There are reports from the East that considerable
psychological dependence has occurred in a minority of
individuals in whom the use of the drug has become a major
component of their existence.107 </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Cannabis
and other Drugs </h3>

<p>172. The minority of cannabis users studied in North America
have had experience with a variety of other psychoactive drugs,
alcohol and tobacco being the most frequently mentioned. As might
be expected, most of those who smoke cannabis first acquired a
regular tobacco habit. </p>

<p>A link between tobacco smoking and marijuana use has been
suggested by Rowell, who worked closely with the United States
Bureau of Narcotics in the 1930s:191 </p>

<p>Slowly, insidiously, for over three hundred years, Lady
Nicotine was setting the stage for a grand climax. The long years
of tobacco using were but an introduction and training for
marijuana use. Tobacco, which was first smoked in a pipe, then as
a cigar, and at last as a cigarette, demanded more and more of
itself until its supposed pleasures palled, and some of the
tobacco victims looked about for something stronger. Tobacco was
no longer potent enough. </p>

<p>173. The relationship between cannabis and alcohol use has
been the subject of much controversy. Many marijuana users claim
that they have drastically reduced their consumption of alcohol,
or quit it, since using cannabis. They often suggest that
cannabis may be a cure for society's alcohol ills. The
considerable hostility towards and rejection of alcohol expressed
by many cannabis-using youth, however, is clearly not reflected
in the majority of cannabis users. In general, survey studies
find that those who use alcohol are more likely than
'teetotallers' to use cannabis, and most cannabis users still use
alcohol. We have no information as to what effects, cannabis has
on an individual's drinking behaviour and overall alcohol intake.
It is not clear whether cannabis tends to replace alcohol as an
intoxicant in the user population or whether the use of these
drugs is addictive without significant interaction, or if the use
of one of these drugs potentiates the use of the other. It
appears that, if used simultaneously, the alcohol effects
dominate and many of the psychedelic aspects of cannabis are
suppressed. For this reason, many cannabis users refuse to mix
the drugs even if they may enjoy one separately. </p>

<p>The question of comparing benefits and ills of alcohol and
cannabis has become a popular and engaging endeavour. Due to the
profoundly different social connotations and patterns of use, as
well as scientific knowledge of these drugs, such a comparison
must be made on limited and tenuous grounds. </p>

<p>174. In the United States, the majority of persons studied who
had been dependent on opiate narcotics, had previous experience
with cannabis (and were usually heavy users of alcohol). In
Canada this has less often been the pattern, and it appears that
heavy use of sedatives (alcohol and barbiturates) rather than
cannabis has most frequently preceded heroin use.246,215 </p>

<p>It has been suggested that the Canadian pattern is becoming
more similar to the United States experience. </p>

<p>On this topic, the <i>United States Task Force Report </i>(1967)
concludes:220 </p>

<p>The charge that marijuana 'leads to the use of addicting
drugs' need to be critically examined. There is evidence that a
majority of the heroin users who come to the attention of public
authorities have, in fact, had some prior experience with
marijuana. But this does not mean that one leads to the other in
the sense that marijuana has an intrinsic quality that creates a
heroin liability. There are too many marijuana users who do not
graduate to heroin, and too many heroin addicts with no known
prior marijuana use, to support such a theory. Moreover there is
no scientific basis for such a theory. </p>

<p>The most reasonable hypothesis here is that some people who
are predisposed to marijuana are also predisposed to heroin use
it may also be the case, that through the use of marijuana a
person forms the personal associations that later expose him to
heroin. </p>

<p>With a similar orientation, the British <i>Cannabis </i>report
(1968) states:5 '. . . we have concluded that a risk of
progression to heroin from cannabis is not a reason for retaining
the control over this drug (cannabis).' </p>

<p>175. Many heavy users of cannabis reportedly also experiment
with a variety of other drugs, including amphetamines as well as
psychedelic substances. Again, marijuana is often the first drug
(other than alcohol and tobacco) taken by youthful multi-drug
users. The role of cannabis in the 'progression' to other drugs
has not been adequately studied and it is unclear whether it
plays a predisposing role, or is often used earlier simply
because of its wider availability and social acceptance. </p>

<p>176. While no cross-tolerance occurs between cannabis and the
other psychedelic drugs or the stimulants, considerable mention
has been made of 'multi-drug' psychological dependence in which
individuals may seem to depend on a variety of drugs in general,
rather than on any particular chemical substance. </p>

<p>177. Initiation of Cannabis Use. Cannabis users are usually
'turned on' for the first time by friends and associates who have
had previous experience with the drug. There is little evidence
of aggressive 'pushers' being responsible for the initiation of
cannabis smoking, although many individuals have reported
considerable peer-group pressure to try it. The distribution or
trafficking of cannabis is largely carried out in the same social
manners and is usually handed from friend to friend, although
there are some individuals whose motivation for trafficking is
primarily commercial. Some of the marijuana in Canada is
'home-grown' but most apparently comes from Mexico and the
southern United States. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Some
Cannabis Studies of Current Significance </h3>

<p>178. I. In 1939, after consulting with the New York Academy of
Medicine, Mayor La Guardia of New York appointed a special
scientific committee to investigate the effects of marijuana,
both in the community and under laboratory conditions. The final
report entitled <i>The Marijuana Problem in the City New York:
Sociological, Medical, Psychological and Pharmacological Studies</i>149
was published in 1944, and is still one of the most widely quoted
and comprehensive studies of cannabis. </p>

<p>The report provoked considerable controversy, and although it
has been generally well received by the scientific community,
certain other individual were quite vociferous in expressing
their dismay at the committee's conclusions. O.J. Kalant120 of
the Addiction Research Foundation, has prepared a careful
critical analysis of the Mayor's report. She observed that:
'Judged from a purely scientific standpoint this study deserves
neither the extravagant praise nor the vicious attacks to which
it has been submitted.' </p>

<p>179. The field work for the sociological study was undertaken
by six specially trained police officers. The squad 'lived' in
the environment in which marijuana smoking or peddling was
suspected. They frequented poolrooms, bars and grills, dance
halls, subways, public toilets, parks and docks. On the basis of
their observations, the following conclusions were drawn: The
distribution and use was centred in Harlem. While the cost of
marijuana was low and therefore within range of most persons, the
sale and distribution was not under the control of any single
organized group. The consensus among users was that the drug
created a definite feeling of adequacy. The practice of smoking
marijuana did not lead to addiction in the medical sense of the
word, did not lead to morphine or heroin or cocaine addiction,
and no effort was made to create a market for opiate narcotics by
stimulating the practice of marijuana smoking. Marijuana was not
the determining factor in the commission of major crimes, nor was
it the cause of juvenile delinquency. Finally, 'the publicity
concerning the catastrophic effects of marijuana smoking in New
York City is unfounded.' </p>

<p>180. The clinical studies were conducted with an experimental
group of 77 persons - 72 of whom were inmates of various New York
Prisons. Forty-eight of these subjects had used marijuana
previously and some had been heavy users of opiate narcotics.
Both orally ingested cannabis concentrate and ordinary marijuana
cigarettes were administered in various quantities. </p>

<p>A feeling of euphoria, occasionally interrupted by unpleasant
sensations, was the usual response to cannabis. Also noted were
other common aspects of a marijuana 'high', such as laughter and
relaxation. No signs of aggression occurred, although some
indications of anti-social feelings were expressed. Dizziness, a
light floating sensation, dryness of the throat, thirst, an
increase in appetite (particularly for sweets), unsteadiness and
a feeling of heaviness of the extremities, were among the common
somatic symptoms noted. Nausea and vomiting occasionally occurred
with oral ingestion. Most effects seemed to increase with dose
and were often more pronounced on those who had not previously
used cannabis. </p>

<p>181. There were 9 cases of psychotic reaction in the prisoners
studied. In 6 instances, acute or short-term adverse reactions
characterized by '... mental confusion and excitement of
delirious nature with periods of laughter and anxiety' occurred.
Three cases of 'true' psychosis appeared to be associated with
the experiment. 'The precise role marijuana in the psychotic
states of the three unstable persons is not clear.' In the first
subject 'the psychotic episode was probably related to epilepsy.'
In the case of the second and third subjects, the fact that they
were sent back to prison to complete their sentences must be
considered an important, if not the main factor in bringing on
the psychosis.' None of the nine individuals had been a regular
user of cannabis. The researchers pointed out, however, that
marijuana can bring on a true psychotic state under certain
circumstances in predisposed individuals. </p>

<p>182. The most consistent physiological effects reported were:
a temporary increase in heart rate, an inconsistent increase in
blood pressure, and increase in frequency of urination, dilated
pupils, and a moderate increase in blood sugar level and basal
metabolism. Other organic and systematic functions were
unchanged. It should be pointed out that the tests reported were
not conducted under controlled double-blind conditions, and some
of these findings have not been confirmed in later controlled
studies. </p>

<p>183. Simple psychomotor functions were only affected slightly
by large doses, and negligibly or not at all by small doses of
marijuana. More complex functions, hand steadiness, static
equilibrium, and complex reaction time were impaired by both dose
levels. Generally, non-users were more affected by the marijuana
than those with previous marijuana experience. Strength of grip,
speed of tapping, auditory acuity, 'musical ability' and
estimation of short time intervals and linear distances were
unchanged. Placebos were not generally used in this section and
the details of the statistical analysis were not presented. </p>

<p>184. In the section on Intellectual Functioning, a variety of
psychological tests designed to measure aspects of intelligence,
learning, memory and performance were administered. Two doses of
oral concentrate were used in most instances. The author
concludes that marijuana ingestion ... has a transitory ,adverse
effect on mental functioning', with the greatest impairment at
high dose on tasks involving complex functions. No statistical
analysis was done to distinguish drug effects from statistical
analysis was done to distinguish drug effects from random
variation, however, and again, no controlled double-blind design
was used. Furthermore, the author's conclusions are not always
consistent with the evidence which, for example, suggests some
improvement in verbal abilities and certain other functions after
marijuana ingestion. These data are not discussed. The author
notes that 'indulgence in marijuana does not appear to result in
mental deterioration'. </p>

<p>Kalant has noted with respect to this section: 120 </p>

<p>In summary, the results seem to bear out the conclusion that
big enough doses of marijuana impair variety of mental functions,
while small doses may improve some of them. These conclusions are
only tentative, because the author presents no statistical
treatment of the data. </p>

<p>185. The 'Emotional and General Personality Structure' of
varying numbers of users and non-users were studied before and
after several doses of cannabis. The effects of low dose were
generally pleasant and favourably received by the subjects, while
the high dose seemed more likely to produce anxiety, distress,
and a sense of insecurity. The committee concluded: </p>

<p>Under the influence of marijuana the basic personality
structure of the individual does not change, but some of the more
superficial aspects of his behaviour show alteration. The new
feeling of self confidence induced by the drug expresses itself
primarily through oral rather than through physical activity.
There is some indication of a diminution in physical activity.
The disinhibition which results from the use of marijuana
releases what is latent in the individual's thoughts and
emotions, but does not evoke responses which would be totally
alien to him in his undrugged state. </p>

<p>186. A comparison between users and non-users as regards the
possibility of physical and mental deterioration as a consequence
of marijuana use was made on 48 users, some of whom had been
smoking regularly for two to seventeen years. The investigators
concluded that: </p>

<p>There is definite evidence in this study that the marijuana
users were not inferior in intelligence to the general population
and that they had suffered no mental or physical deterioration as
a result of their use of the drug. </p>

<p>187. The therapeutic use of cannabis in the treatment of
opiate narcotic addicts was explored in 56 patients. Tentative
conclusions suggest improved appetite and mood, less severe
symptoms and a generally improved clinical picture during
withdrawal. Again no control group was studied. </p>

<p>The Committee reported: </p>

<p>From the study as a whole, it is concluded that marijuana is
not a drug of addiction, comparable to morphine, and that if
tolerance is acquired, this is of a very limited degree.... The
habit depends on the pleasurable effects that the drug produces. </p>

<p>These views were based largely on interviews with hundreds of
users, the sociological studies and the laboratory
investigations. Some observers have pointed out that these
conclusions may not apply to the conditions of heavy chronic use
sometimes reported in Eastern countries. </p>

<p>188. Some individuals have criticized the research for often
using high doses of little social relevance - the authors admit
that users, if left to their own devices, tend to approximate the
lower doses used in the experiment. Other investigators feel that
more chronic users of higher doses should have been studied for
the investigation of long-term effects including tolerance and
dependence. </p>

<p>189. In summary, although the La Guardia report remains one of
the more significant contributions to the cannabis literature,
the conclusions must be qualified in accordance with the numerous
weaknesses in the experimental methodology: blind and placebo
controls were absent and statistical analyses often lacking,
reporting was occasionally biased when the data were ambiguous,
sample selection may not have been adequate for certain
conclusions in the sociological study, and the almost complete
use of prison inmates as subjects in the clinical studies and
hospital ward setting may further restrict generalizations. </p>

<p>190. II. Isbell et al109 investigated the effects of various
doses of smoked and orally ingested tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)in
a group of former opiate narcotic addicts who had also had
experience with marijuana. The drug was compared to an inactive
placebo control in a single-blind design (i.e., the researchers,
but not the subjects, knew which samples were being tested). </p>

<p>191. Regardless of dose and route of administration, THC
caused no significant change in pupillary size, respiration rate,
blood pressure, or knee-jerk reflex threshold. Heart pulse rate
was consistently elevated, and swelling of the conjunctival blood
vessels in the membrane around the eyes occurred after the higher
doses. In both physiological and psychological measures, THC (at
a standard dose) was found to be two to three times as potent
when smoked as when taken orally. </p>

<p>192. Patients identified the drug as being similar to
marijuana and some suggested that it was something like LSD or
cocaine as well. Euphoria was consistently noted and no mention
was made in the report of unpleasant adverse reactions.
Psychological changes included '. . - alterations in sense of
time and in visual and auditory perception (usually described as
keener).' With higher doses, both smoked and orally ingested, '.
. .marked distortion in visual and auditory perception,
depersonalization, derealization and hallucinations, both
auditory and optical, occurred in most patients. THC, therefore
is a psychotomimetic drug and its psychotomimetic effects are
dependent on dose.' Such occurrences may also appear in some
individuals as 'idiosyncratic' reactions at lower doses. It had
been noted that the symptoms which Isbell has labelled
'psychotomimetic' might be called 'psychedelic' by scientists
with a different orientation. </p>

<p>193. The application of these findings to marijuana use as it
occurs in North America is unclear. Some observers, in both lay
and scientific circles, have interpreted this report as an
indication of the dangers of marijuana, while other scientists
question the relevance of these findings in relation to the 'real
world' of marijuana usage.251 </p>

<p>194. III. In 1968, Weil, Zinberg and Nelsen 239,240 reported
the first adequately controlled experiment on cannabis effects in
humans. The primary section of the study is concerned with
effects on nine subjects who were inexperienced with cannabis.
The researchers gave two different doses of marijuana (0.5 and
1.0gm of 0.9% THC) and an inactive placebo substance in a
controlled 'double-blind' situation - i.e., neither the subjects
nor the researchers knew at the time of the experiment which dose
of cannabis or placebo was administered. This procedure greatly
reduces the influence of expectations and bias on the part of
both subjects and researchers. In addition to the naive subjects,
eight chronic marijuana users (who normally smoked daily or every
other day) were tested with the high dose only. No placebo was
used with these subjects since the authors felt that experienced
marijuana smokers could readily distinguish the placebo from the
'real thing', and consequently a true placebo control was not
possible. Subjects took either the drug or placebo by a standard
and uniform inhalation method designed to minimize practice
effects and individual differences in smoking technique.
Subsequently, they were tested on a battery of standard
psychological and psychomotor tasks, and certain physiological
measurements were taken in a neutral laboratory setting. </p>

<p>195. The physiological findings were quite straightforward:
heart rate was increased moderately, no significant change in
respiration rate occurred, blood sugar level was unchanged
(although the timing of the samples may not have been optimal),
no change in pupil size was seen and a slight swelling of the
conjunctival blood vessels (producing a reddening of the
membranes around the eye) occurred. The researchers suggest that
the near absence of significant physiological effects '... makes
it unlikely that marijuana has any seriously detrimental physical
effects in either a short-term or long-term usage.' </p>

<p>196. The capacity for sustained attention (Continuous
Performance Test) was unaffected by cannabis in both the nave
and chronic user groups, even when a flickering strobe light was
presented to provide distraction. Muscular coordination and
attention performance (Pursuit Rotor Test) declined as dose was
increased in nave subjects, but improved slightly after
marijuana use in the chronic users. (This improvement was
considered a result of practice rather than a drug effect but can
not be properly evaluated due to the lack of a placebo
measurement in the experienced users.) Performance on the Digit
Symbol Substitution Test, (a simple test of cognitive function
often used in I.Q. tests) was impaired in the nave groups,
while the experienced smokers started off at a reasonable base
line and actually improved slightly when they were 'high' - a
trend which can not be accounted for solely by practice. A
tendency to overestimate time was also noted in these subjects.
The researchers caution that the differences between users and
nonusers in this study must only be considered a trend since the
testing situations were not strictly comparable for the two
groups. </p>

<p>197. Subjects were given five minutes to talk on 'an
interesting or dramatic experience' and the content of the verbal
report was analysed. Marijuana did not impair the
understandability of the material as measured by the Cloze
method, although judges could consistently distinguish the
transcripts of pre- and post-drug samples in both the naive and
experienced groups. A 'strange' quality in the post-drug samples
was noted but not easily quantified. The investigators suggested
that marijuana may temporarily interfere with short-term memory -
i.e., the ability to retrieve or remember events occurring in the
past few seconds. They feel that this may explain why many
marijuana smokers, when very 'high', may have trouble
remembering, from moment to moment, the logical thread of what is
being said. Controlled investigation of this hypothesis is
currently under way. </p>

<p>198. The experienced subjects were asked to rate themselves on
a scale from one to ten, with ten representing the 'highest' they
had ever been. Ratings given were between seven and ten, with
most subjects at eight or nine. This would suggest that the
sample was of reasonable potency and the smoking technique
effective. On the other hand, with the same dose and smoking
technique, only one of the naive subjects had, a definite
marijuana 'high'. (Interestingly, he was the one subject who had
earlier expressed an eagerness to 'turn on'.) The researchers
point out that the introspective report of an individual is the
only way to determine if he is 'high' on marijuana or not. There
are, as of yet, no known objective signs which allow one to
identify this state. </p>

<p>199. There was no change in mood in the neutral laboratory
setting in either naive or chronic user subjects, as measured by
self-rating scales and a content analysis of the verbal sample.
There were no adverse marijuana reactions of any kind in any of
the subjects, although tobacco cigarettes smoked during a
practice session, using the standard technique produced acute
nicotine reactions in five subjects which 'were far more
spectacular than any effects produced by marijuana'. The authors
conclude: </p>

<p>In a neutral setting persons who are naive to marijuana do not
have strong subjective experiences after smoking low or high
doses of the drug, and the effects they do report are not the
same as those described by regular users of marijuana who take
the drug in the same neutral setting. Marijuana naive persons do
demonstrate impaired performance on simple intellectual and
psychomotor tests after smoking marijuana; the impairment is
dose-related in some cases. Regular users of marijuana do get
high after smoking marijuana in a neutral setting but do not show
the same degree of impairment of performance on the test as do
naive subjects. In some cases, their performance even appears to
improve slightly after smoking marijuana. </p>

<p>200.<i> The New Republic, </i>in an editorial responding to
this report, wrote: 'While pot heads may legitimately ask,
&quot;So what else is new?&quot; the study may have a pacifying
influence on parents and officials who fear the drug on the basis
of unsubstantiated horror stories.'251 While numerous scientists
have expressed similar views, the study does provide a long
overdue empirically adequate beginning to the scientific study of
marijuana effects on humans. While this study has implications
extending beyond the laboratory, there has been a tendency in the
popular press to overgeneralize from the results. It would be
imprudent to extrapolate the findings into social and legal areas
for which the study was not designed and is not appropriate. </p>

<p>201. IV. Jones and Stone116 in 1969 reported that smoked
marijuana (equivalent to Weil's low dose) compared to a placebo
in ten 'heavy users' resulted in: moderately increased heart
rate, altered electroencephalogram (EEG), over-estimation of time
(but no change in time interval production), no effect on the
ability to attend to relevant internal cues to the exclusion of
irrelevant external cues (Rod and Frame test), and no effect on
the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (the same measure of cognitive
functioning employed in the Weil study). A double dose of
marijuana (comparable to Weil's high dose) produced a deficit in
visual information processing - the only test studied with this
quantity of drug. </p>

<p>202. The subjects were asked to rate the low dose and placebo
on a scale from 0-100 as to marijuana quality. The mean rating
were 66 for the low dose and 57 for the placebo, which was not a
significant difference. While this suggests that the dose of
marijuana used was probably too low to be very effective and may
reduce the significance of the report, it is interesting that the
supposedly inactive 'placebo' (with only a &quot;trace&quot; of
THC) was given a rating suggesting moderate potency by ten heavy
marijuana users in San Francisco. However, it appears that the
subjective effects of the placebo and low dose marijuana, as
measured by a self-rating subjective symptom check-list, may have
been different, although no statistics are presented, and the
figure containing this information does not clearly identify the
placebo. At any rate, these findings suggest that at low doses a
simple 'highness' dimension may not be easy to quantify reliably.
Unfortunately, Weil did not get ratings on his low dose or
placebo, and Jones did not assess the high dose, so a
reconciliation is not possible with the present data. </p>

<p>203. The researchers also studied a larger dose of marijuana
extract (equivalent to 20 cigarettes) given orally, compared with
a placebo and one dose of alcohol (producing blood alcohol levels
of 0.06 to 0.12%). Several tasks were used with the same
subjects. Certain comparisons among the conditions and drugs are
possible, although the use of a single dose and slight variations
in procedure limits the applicability of the findings. </p>

<p>204. The marijuana smoked in low doses produced an
'unimpressive' high with a maximum effect at about 15 minutes and
lasting about three hours, while the oral administration had a
latency of almost two hours, a peak at three to four hours and
mild subjective effects lasting eight to ten hours. The oral dose
of marijuana occasionally produced nausea and in one case
vomiting, and differed from the smoked material on several
subjective dimensions. The results of the comparisons between the
oral marijuana and the placebo were essentially the same as those
discussed earlier for the smoked material. As a point of<i> </i>reference,
the single alcohol dose did not affect performance on the Rod and
Frame Test, produced an underestimation of time intervals,
decreased rate of information processing, did not affect heart
rate, and produced a slowing of the EEG. Little meaningful
comparison can be made between alcohol and the other treatments
at a single dosage level, however. </p>

<p>205. The report is ambiguous and many important details of
methodology and results are excluded in what appears to be a
preliminary investigation. It should be noted that this study has
only single-blind controls and the investigators knew which drugs
were administered at the time of the experiment. </p>

<p>206. V. A third recent experimental study of marijuana effects
on humans was published by Clark and Nakashima46 in 1968 and is
mentioned here since it is now frequently quoted and, also, to
demonstrate some of the problems of interpreting inadequately
controlled experiments. Several different doses of marijuana
extract (of unknown THC content) were given to 12 marijuana naive
subjects, and the effects recorded on eight psychological tests
in 'one control and two or three subsequent sessions'. </p>

<p>207. The study is unintepretable for a variety of reasons,
some of which follow: since the control session and the various
drug doses were given only once, and on separate days, drug and
dose effects are indistinguishably confounded with various
factors of treatment order (including practice and other learning
effects), and natural variations in performance occurring from
one day to the next; the researchers describe no basis,
statistical or otherwise, for distinguishing the 'effects' from
random variation; they report only trends in the data in one or
two subjects selected on an unspecified basis, and give no
indication of overall group effects; the numerical basis for the
figures presented is unspecified; apparently no placebos were
given on the 'control' day which was invariably the first
session, yet the drug is frequently compared with the 'control'
in individual subjects; apparently no 'blind' controls were
provided in either the experiment or later data analysis; and the
report is presented with a strong negative bias in the
introduction and remainder of the article, which is not supported
empirically. The authors infer marijuana-induced impairment only
on the reaction time and 'digit code memory' tasks, although they
provide no reliable evidence for the presence or absence of
positive or negative marijuana effects on these or the other
tests studied. </p>

<p>Clark concludes that great individual variation exists among
individuals in response to the drug. While this would seem a
reasonable observation, effects have not been identified, much
less the variance of their distribution assessed. The great
variability in the data cannot be attributed solely to the drug
for reasons outlined above. In summary, this study, conducted,
financially supported and published by highly accredited
individuals and institutions, adds nothing but confusion to the
existing knowledge and should encourage scepticism regarding even
modern 'scientific' information on marijuana. </p>

<p>208. VI. Last year Crancer and associates,61 from the
Washington State Department of Motor Vehicles, published the
first experimental study of marijuana effects on automobile
driving skills. A laboratory driving simulator was employed which
had been shown previously to validly predict road accidents and
traffic violations on the basis of speedometer, steering,
braking, accelerator and signal errors measured during a
programmed series of 'emergency' situations. This study has
provoked considerable controversy, some of which may be
dissipated if the different sections of the study are examined
separately. </p>

<p>209. Using a sophisticated methodological and statistical
design, the effects of the single dose of marijuana (2
cigarettes) were assessed in 36 experienced marijuana smokers who
used cannabis at least twice a month. In terms of total THC
administered, the dose was about 22% greater than Weil's high
dose and almost 2  times the standard dose used by Jones.
Crancer reports the effects as a 'normal social marijuana high',
although this is not quantified in any way and it is not certain
how this relates to the overall pattern of marijuana use in the
population. Simulator scores were obtained at three intervals
over a 4  hour period. Control (no treatment) sessions were
run, although no placebo substance was used since the
investigators felt that a placebo would not be effective with
experienced marijuana users. </p>

<p>210. Overall performance under the single dose of marijuana
was not different from the control. The main study was followed
by two 'cursory' investigations. Four subjects were retested with
three times the original drug dose and none showed a significant
change in performance. Furthermore, four marijuana naive subjects
were tested after smoking enough marijuana to become 'high' (all
consumed at least the amount used in the main experiment and
demonstrated an increase in heart rate in addition to subjective
effects). No significant change in scores occurred with the drug
in these subjects either. </p>

<p>The investigators caution that the study does not necessarily
indicate that marijuana will not impair driving. </p>

<p>However, we feel that, because the simulator task is a less
complex but related task, deterioration in simulator performance
implies deterioration in actual driving performance. We are less
willing to assume that non-deterioration in simulator performance
implies non-deterioration in actual driving. </p>

<p>211. One weakness of this part of the study is that apparently
no standard and uniform smoking technique was employed and it is
not certain how much of the active principle was actually
absorbed. Although a biochemical method for detecting THC in the
body has recently been developed, quantitative measurements have
not been employed in any experimental marijuana studies. Although
higher doses were tested in some subjects, this was not done with
the same thoroughness as the main experiment and little can be
asserted regarding a dose-response effect of marijuana on
driving. It seems likely that if the dose were pushed high enough
some impairment would occur, although this has not been
empirically demonstrated. </p>

<p>212. In order to obtain some standard reference point for this
study, the subjects were also tested under a single dose of
alcohol, designed to produce a blood alcohol level corresponding
to the legal standard of presumed driving impairment in
Washington (i.e., 0.10% blood alcohol level). The average number
of errors under alcohol (97.4) was significantly greater than
that acquired under either the normal or marijuana condition
(each averaging 84.5 errors). While it is clear that a meaningful
comparison of the two drugs cannot be based on a single dose of
each, the alcohol data were obtained merely to provide a
'recognized standard' of impairment. </p>

<p>Kalant118 has pointed out that the blood alcohol level of
these subjects may have been considerably higher than the desired
0.10%, and that comparisons between the drugs must be made with
caution due to the single doses used. He also suggests that
although it would not have been easy for the subjects to 'fake'
good driving performance under marijuana, an anti-alcohol bias,
as often seen in marijuana users, could have resulted in poorer
performance in the alcohol condition. </p>

<p>If the limitations of the alcohol-marijuana comparison and the
weakness of the marijuana dose-effect generalizations are
realized, the over-all study provides interesting tentative
information on the effects of a moderate quantity of marijuana on
driving skills. </p>

<p>213. VII. In general, studies of the long-term history of
marijuana users have been based either on medical or criminal
samples or on subjects selected because of current use. Each of
these sources of subjects has considerable intrinsic sampling
bias - which greatly complicates the interpretation of results.
Recently, however, Robins and associates,187 reported the first
study of the long-term outcome of marijuana use in a group not
selected for deviant behaviour. The subjects were 235 Negro men
who had gone to public elementary school in the black district of
St. Louis, Missouri, in the early 1940s. While the
characteristics of such a population may have questionable
applicability to present marijuana use in Canada, this generally
thorough study should be carefully considered. The data are
largely based on recent retrospective personal interviews and
official records. Subjects were classified according to
adolescent drug use. </p>

<p>214. Persons in this sample who had used marijuana (and no
other drug except alcohol) differed significantly from
non-marijuana users, in that the users had more often: drunk
heavily enough to create social or medical problems, failed to
graduate from high school, reported their own infidelity or
fathering of illegitimate children, received financial aid, had
adult police records for non-drug offences, and reported violent
behaviour. While these findings indicate an association between
marijuana use and these other behavioural characteristics in this
population, causal variables have not been identified. </p>

<p>215. The heavy use of alcohol in these subjects complicates
the interpretation considerably. Every marijuana user also used
alcohol, and drinking usually preceded marijuana use. Among the
subjects who used only marijuana and alcohol, 47% had medical or
social problems attributable to drinking ('the
&quot;shakes&quot;, liver trouble, family complaints, arrests,
etc.') after the age of 25, and 38% of the users met the criteria
for alcoholism. When those subjects who were classified as
alcoholics were eliminated from the data (and the remainder of
the problem drinkers left in) the only statistically significant
difference between the marijuana users and the non-users was with
respect to financial aid received in the past five years.
Non-significant trends remained, however, which were generally
similar to the earlier differences. Subjects who used 'harder'
drugs (e.g., heroin, amphetamines and barbiturates) in addition
to marijuana were significantly more deviant than the non-users,
even after the alcoholics had been eliminated from the sample.
Almost one-half of the subjects who had used marijuana also had
used other drugs illegally. </p>

<p>The alcoholics, in addition to having a history of early
drinking, were also more likely to have used marijuana as
adolescents. Unfortunately, no record of intensity of early
drinking or marijuana use was obtained. A possible causal
relationship between marijuana use and problem drinking, or
vice-versa, or a possible third set of factors predisposing
certain individuals to both alcoholism and marijuana use cannot
be established or denied on the basis of the present data. The
relationship between marijuana use and the use of harder drugs is
also troublesome. </p>

<p>The authors conclude: </p>

<p>One small study of the effects of drug use in 76 Negro
adolescents can hardly serve to determine the laws of the land.
But it may at least make us cautious in too readily supporting
the view that marijuana is harmless, until some better evidence
is available. </p>

<p>216. VIII. The Addiction Research Foundation of Ontario has
recently conducted a study of 232 confirmed marijuana users in
Toronto.173 Prisons and court referrals provided about half of
the subjects and the remainder were volunteers not contacted
through criminal-legal channels. The majority came from
middle-class or upper middle-class homes and 16% were students.
The average age was 22 (range: 15-42) and males outnumbered
females 4 to 1. The average duration of marijuana use was 2.7
years (range: 1-20). </p>

<p>217. Preliminary observations suggest the following
characteristics in this sample: the subjects tended to be
multiple drug users (tobacco and alcohol were used by almost all
of the subjects, more than half had tried LSD and speed, and
one-third had tried opiate narcotics); most had 'trafficked' in
marijuana, but usually just to friends; cannabis was generally
used about twice a week in the company of friends, accompanied by
passive rather than active behaviour; purported reasons for use
were increased perception and awareness, other psychedelic
effects, improved mood, and conviviality. Almost all subjects
found the usual effects favourable although about a third had had
at least one unpleasant experience (physiological or
psychological) with the drug; about half had driven a car while
under the influence of cannabis, and of these subjects, more than
half felt that their driving ability was unimpaired by the drug;
about half felt that cannabis had improved their lives, while
some thought it had worsened things; the subjects 'tended to be
underactive physically, engaging in passive pursuits'; about
one-third subscribed to the belief in the 'protestant work
ethic', while almost as many rejected it; almost one-third had
committed non-drug criminal offences; one-half showed a swelling
of the fine conjunctival blood vessels around the eye;
nonspecific deviant EEGs were frequently seen; more than half
were thought by a psychiatrist to be psychologically unstable or
disturbed; and the group as a whole tended to be more imaginative
and creative than what would be expected in the general
population. </p>

<p>218. The researchers stress that their findings demonstrate an
association, and not necessarily a causal relationship, between
the regular use of cannabis and other characteristics in this
sample. While some of these results may be attributable to the
selection or bias of the sample (e.g., half were contacted
through criminal correction channels), much of the information
may have general application. On-going analysis of the data
should further clarify the results, although the lack of a
comparable matched control group will undoubtedly preclude
certain generalizations since we have little information
regarding the incidence of many of the aforementioned
characteristics in non-marijuana using individuals of similar
social, economic and educational backgrounds. Furthermore, the
frequent use of other drugs by these subjects may limit
conclusions specific to cannabis use. </p>

<p>219. IX. In response to questions raised in the British House
of Commons, the Government of India, in 1893, appointed a
commission to investigate and report on the cannabis ('hemp
drugs') situation in India. The commission was instructed to
inquire into the extent to which the hemp plant was cultivated,
the preparation of drugs from it, the trade in those drugs, the
extent of their use, and the effects of their consumption upon
the social, physical, mental, and moral conditions of the people.
The different forms of the drug, especially bhang, ganja, and
charas (hashish), were to be studied separately. The Commission
'&#133;should ascertain whether, and in what form, the
consumption of the drugs is either harmless or even beneficial as
has occasionally been maintained'. In addition, they were asked
to investigate certain economic aspects of the use of hemp (e.g.,
tax arrangements and import and export patterns), and also the
potential political, social or religious results of prohibition. <i>The
Report of the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission </i>(1894),107
including appendices, comprised seven volumes and totalled 3,281
pages. </p>

<p>220. In 1968, Mikuriya,158 in the first thorough discussion of
this report to appear in the Western scientific literature,
suggested that this investigation </p>

<p>. . . is by far the most complete, and systematic study of
marijuana undertaken to date.... It is both surprising and
gratifying to note the timeless and lucid quality of the writings
of these British colonial bureaucrats. It would be fortunate if
studies undertaken by contemporary commissions, task force
committees, and study groups could measure up to the standard of
thoroughness and general objectivity embodied in this report ...
many of the issues concerning marijuana being argued in the
United States today were dealt with in the Indian Hemp Drugs
Commission Report. </p>

<p>Until recently only about a half dozen copies of this report
were available in North America. In the introduction to a new
printing of the primary volume in 1969, Kaplan121 observed: </p>

<p>That this report, which remains today by far the most complete
collection of information on marijuana in existence, should have
been so completely forgotten in an era when controversy over the
effects of the drug and, the wisdom of its criminalization has
increased to such fervor is almost inexplicable. </p>

<p>221. The Indian Hemp Drugs Commission received testimony from
1,193 witnesses of a total of 80 meeting in 30 cities. Over 300
medical practitioners were consulted and inquiries were made of
Commanding Officers of all regiments of the Army, The
commissioners investigated the records of every mental hospital
in British India and evaluated separately each of the 222 cases
admitted during the year 1892, in which some connection between
hemp drugs and insanity had been suggested (these made up about
10 per cent of all admissions) Furthermore, all 81 cases of
crimes of violence in India purported to have been caused by
cannabis over the previous 20 years were investigated and
re-examined. In addition, three laboratory experiments were
conducted with monkeys to study the effects of cannabis on the
nervous system. </p>

<p>222. In the short time during which the full report has been
available to us, we have not been able to prepare, at this
interim stage, a thorough critical analysis of the document.
However, the following quotations, taken from the summary of
conclusions regarding the effects of hemp drugs, provide an
overview of the findings: </p>

<p>It has been clearly established that the occasional use of
hemp in moderate doses may be beneficial. In regard to the
physical effects, the Commission have come to the conclusion that
the moderate use of hemp drugs, is practically attended by no
evil results at all. There may be exceptional cases in which,
owing to idiosyncrasies of constitution, the drugs in even
moderate use of hemp drugs in even moderate use may be injurious,
excessive use does cause injury. As in the case of other
intoxicants, excessive use tends to weaken the constitution and
to render the consumer more susceptible to disease &#133; the
excessive use of these drugs does not cause asthma. . . it may
indirectly cause dysentery ... (and) it may cause bronchitis. </p>

<p>In respect to the alleged mental effects of the drugs, the
Commission have come to the conclusion that the moderate use of
hemp drugs produces no injurious effects on the mind.... It is
otherwise with the excessive use. Excessive use indicates and
intensifies mental instability... It appears that the excessive
use of hemp drugs may, especially in cases where there is any
weakness or hereditary predisposition, induce insanity. It has
been shown that the effect of hemp drugs in this respect has
hitherto been greatly exaggerated, but that they do sometimes
produce insanity seems beyond question. </p>

<p>In regard to the moral effects of the drugs, the Commission
are of opinion that their moderate use produces no moral injury
whatever. There is no adequate ground for believing that it
injuriously affects the character of the consumer. Excessive
consumption, on the other hand, both indicates and intensifies
moral weakness or depravity. . . . In respect to his relations
with society, however, even the excessive consumer of hemp drugs
is ordinarily inoffensive. His excesses may indeed bring him to
degraded poverty which may lead him to dishonest practices; and
occasionally, but apparently very rarely indeed, excessive
indulgence in hemp drugs may lead to violent crime. But for all
practical purposes it may be laid down that there is little or no
connection between the use of hemp drugs and crime. </p>

<p>Viewing the subject generally, it may be added that the
moderate use of these drugs is the rule, and that the excessive
use is comparatively exceptional. The moderate use practically
produces no ill effects. In all but the most exceptional cases,
the injury from habitual moderate use is not appreciable. The
excessive use may certainly be accepted as very injurious, though
it must be admitted that in many excessive consumers the injury
is not clearly marked. The injury done by the excessive use is,
however, confined almost exclusively to the consumer himself; the
effect on society is rarely appreciable. It has been the most
striking feature in this inquiry to find how little the effects
of hemp drugs have obtruded themselves on observation. </p>

<p>As noted earlier in this chapter, any generalizations from one
culture to another must be made with great caution. In this
instance, extrapolation to the present Canadian situation would
have to span three-quarters of a century as well. In spite of
these clear limitations, the thoroughness of this critical
inquiry commands respect and the report deserves careful
consideration. <br>

<h3>OPIATE NARCOTICS </h3>

<p> </p>

<p>223. The term narcotic has had wide and inconsistent usage in
lay, legal and scientific circles. Some use the word to
characterize any drug which produces stupor, insensibility or
sleep; many apply it only to derivatives of the opium plant
('opiates'); others consider the term equivalent to
addiction-producing; and in legal matters, 'narcotics' may refer
to almost any allegedly dangerous drugs (for example marijuana
and cocaine are often considered with opiate compounds in
narcotics regulations in spite of the fact that they have little
in common with them). To reduce some of this ambiguity, the
specific phrase opiate narcotic will be used in this report, and
will be restricted to drugs which are derivatives of, or are
pharmacologically similar to products of the opium plant <i>papaver
somniferum</i>. </p>

<p>224. The earliest unambiguous description of opium to which we
have access was written in the third century B.C., although some
scholars have cited references to opiate-like drugs dated more
than 5,000 years ago.29 Many believe that Homer's 'Nepenthe' was
opium. These drugs are obtained from the juice of the unripened
seed pod of the opium poppy plant soon after the flower petals
begin to fall - no other part of the plant produces psychoactive
substances. </p>

<p>Although 'opium eating' has been known in Asia for thousands
of years, widespread use of the drug did not occur until the
development of the British East India Company's wholesale opium
empire in the eighteenth century. The practice of smoking opium
developed in China soon after American tobacco was introduced to
the Orient. Chinese prohibition of the British opium precipitated
the 'opium war' in which the world's greatest naval power forced
China to open its door to the British (opium) trade. 223 </p>

<p>225. In 1805, the major active constituent in opium was
isolated - an alkaloid given the name morphine, after the Greek
God of Dreams, Morpheus. In the next half century, various other
alkaloids were discovered, such as codeine and papaverine, both
if which are in general use today. Since then, a variety of
semisynthetic (e.g., heroin, in 1874) and synthetic (e.g.,
methadone, Demerol* and Alvodine*), opiate-like drugs have been
developed. These compounds have the potential of producing
qualitatively similar actions (at different doses), although
there is considerable variability among them in the potency of
the different opiate effects. Heroin, more potent on a weight
basis than morphine, is usually the choice of the chronic opiate
narcotic user. This drug was originally considered
'non-addictive' when put on the market. Those members of the
medical and related profession who use these drugs non-medically,
as well as others who have become dependent as a result of
medical use, tend, to use morphine or the synthetics. Because of
the similarities among these drugs, they will, with a few
exceptions be dealt with as a group. Heroin (and sometimes other
opiate narcotics) is often referred to as 'H', 'horse', 'junk',
'scrag' or 'smack'. </p>

<p>226. Until the nineteenth century, 'raw' opium was either
smoked or taken orally. There is a decidedly lower dependence
liability -with these techniques than: with 'practices' which
followed and it was not until the isolation of morphine and the
invention of the hypodermic needle that the opiate narcotics
became a serious problem in the Western World. Morphine was
widely acclaimed among medical practitioners and was used freely,
to treat pain during the American Civil War, sometimes producing
a dependency called 'soldiers' disease'. General use of tincture
of opium in many patent medicines (e.g. Paregoric) made the quasi
-medical use of opiates a common practice in North America at
that time. On the West Coast, the influx of Chinese labourers,
some of whom smoked opium, apparently stimulated non-medical use
to some degree. The extent of opiate narcotic problems in the
nineteenth century is difficult to ascertain, however, it would
appear that the use of these drugs was not a major moral issue.
In the early part of the twentieth century, some of the problems
of morphine and heroin dependence became apparent, and most
opiate products were removed from the open market in North
America and non-medical possession was prohibited. </p>

<p>227. Because characteristics fluctuate with social change, a
description of drug users is necessarily tied to a given
population at a given point and time and may have little general
application. There is little information on opiate narcotic users
in North America prior to this century, but many researchers
contend that far more women than men made use of these drugs at
that time. Since the general opiate prohibition in the early part
of this century, men have become the predominant users. While
Chinese opium smokers were not uncommon a half century ago, there
appear to be very few Orientals in North America using opiate
narcotics today. In recent decades, the use of these drugs in
Canada has tended to centre on a few urban areas. Medical and
related professions represent a frequently noted high-risk group
with respect to the development of drug dependency. For various
reasons, statistics on the incidence of dependency in this group
are quite inadequate. Many researchers contend that health
profession dependents constitute a significant proportion of the
total chronic opiate narcotic using population.28 For many years,
the known opiate narcotic users have made up about 0.02 per cent
of the overall Canadian population. </p>

<p>228. Although many observers do not feel that the non-medical
use of opiate narcotics is currently a major public health
problem in Canada, there are numerous reasons for directing
attention to this group of drugs. Historically, the popular
conception of the 'narcotics addict dope fiend' has established
an image of the non-medical drug user which persists and intrudes
into almost every examination or investigation of drug use today.
Furthermore, the opiate narcotics have played an important role
as a model in much of the past and present drug legislation, and
in general crimino-legal approach to the control of socially
censured drug use. Although many important questions about the
opiate narcotics are still unanswered, it is clear that much of
what has commonly passed for fact, is fiction, and often bears
little resemblance to scientific information. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Medical
Use </h3>

<p>229. Most of the current medical uses for the opiate narcotics
were fairly well understood and established in Europe by the
middle of the sixteenth century, and were probably well known in
certain areas long before that time. These drugs are primarily
used in the relief of suffering from pain, in the treatment of
diarrhoea and dysentery, and to reduce cough. Hundreds of related
compounds have been synthesized in attempts to retain the
clinical benefits but reduce the dependence liabilities of the
opiate narcotics. These efforts have not been very successful,
and thus morphine and related drugs are still considered by
physicians to be among the most valuable drugs available to the
practitioner today. Heroin is no longer used medically in North
America. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Administration,
Absorption, Distribution and Physiological Fate </h3>

<p>230. Opiate narcotics are produced in a variety of tablets and
capsules, elixirs, cough syrups (with codeine), injections,
rectal suppositories and, on the illegal market, are also
available in a gummy solid or powdered form. Codeine is often
mixed with other non-opiate analgesics (e.g. APC &amp; C*;
222's*). While the opiate narcotics are well absorbed from the
gastrointestinal tract, this route is often erratic and
unpredictable compared to injections. Among non-medical users,
subcutaneous ('skin popping') and intravenous ('mainlining')
injections are commonly used with heroin and morphine. Raw opium
is usually eaten or smoked and the powder is sometimes sniffed
('snorted'). Only a minute fraction of the drug absorbed actually
enters the central nervous system. The duration and intensity of
the effects vary considerably with the different drugs in this
class (and as a function of dose), although the major action
might typically last from three to six hours. These drugs are
usually inactivated in the liver and excreted in the urine, often
along with small quantities of free morphine. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom"><img
src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Physiological
Effects </h3>

<p>231. Pure opiate narcotics produce few significant
non-psychological effects in therapeutic doses. The immediate or
short-term physiological response usually includes a general
reduction in respiratory and cardiovascular activity, a
depression of the cough reflex, a constriction of the pupil of
the eye, and minor reduction in visual acuity, slight itching,
dilation of cutaneous blood vessels, warming of the skin, a
decrease in intestinal activity (often causing constipation),
and, in some individuals, nausea and vomiting. In higher doses,
however, insensibility and unconsciousness result. The primary
toxic overdose symptoms are coma, shock and, ultimately,
respiratory arrest and death. </p>

<p>232. There appears to be little direct permanent physiological
damage from chronic use of pure opiate narcotics. Numerous
complications are observed, however, if the overall drug use
pattern involves adulterated street samples, unsterile
administrations, unhygienic living standards, poor eating habits
and inadequate general medical care - all of which are commonly
part of the criminal-addict behaviour syndrome. Commonly reported
disorders in street users are hepatitis, tetanus, heart and lung
abnormalities, scarred veins ('track marks'), local skin
infections and abscesses, and obstetrical problems in pregnant
females. At one time, malaria was also commonly seen in this
population. </p>

<p>233. The general mortality rate among heroin dependents is
considerably higher than normally expected for their age group.
Sudden collapse and death following intravenous injection has
been reported in a number of these individuals. Such fatalities
have often been attributed to overdose resulting from erratic and
unexpected variations in the purity of drugs obtained from the
black market. However, there is considerable evidence that many
of these deaths are not merely due to overdose but are a
consequence of partly soluble contaminant substances in the
sample and, perhaps, some drug hypersensitivity phenomenon.43 </p>

<p>234. The subjective effects of narcotics may vary considerably
among different individuals and situations. Most persons
reportedly do not enjoy the experience and may actively avoid its
repetition in a controlled or experimental situation, while
others describe feelings of warmth, well-being, peacefulness and
contentment. Euphoria or dysphoria, nausea, drowsiness,
dizziness, inability to concentrate, apathy and lethargy are
commonly noted. Certain individuals, especially when fatigued may
be stimulated into feelings of energy and strength. Higher doses
produce a turning inward and sleep. Often a pleasant dreamlike
state occurs. Some regular users describe their drug experiences
in near ecstatic, and, often sexual terms (especially the 'rush'
of intravenous injection). </p>

<p>The potential of the opiate narcotics to relieve suffering
from pain depends upon several mechanisms. The major effect is
not on the sensation directly, but on the psychological reaction
to it. Often individuals can still feel the pain sensation, and
rate its intensity reliably, in spite of the fact that much or
all of the negative or unpleasant aspects are absent. In other
words, they may still feel the pain, but it does not bother them
to the same extent. Morphine has little effect on the other
senses and unlike non-narcotic analgesics and sedatives, it can
often control pain at doses which do not necessarily produce
marked sedation, gross intoxication or major impairment of motor
coordination, intellectual functions, emotional control or
judgement.110 In addition to reducing the anxiety of pain and
therefore the motivation to avoid it, the opiate narcotics also
tend to decrease other primary motivation associated with sex,
food, and aggression. </p>

<p>235. The psychological effects of chronic opiate narcotic use
are often rather straightforward extensions of the short-term
response. In regular users, much of the variability and
unpredictability of the immediate response is lessened, partly
because individuals who find the experience unpleasant tend to
avoid additional exposure, and also because many who were
initially upset by the unusual physiological and psychological
sensations caused by the drugs learn to tolerate and even seek
them and may no longer be distressed in the situation. While some
individuals who become dependent on the opiate narcotics withdraw
from regular social activities, and live what might appear to be
an immoral, criminal and slovenly existence, others are able to
lead an otherwise normal life with little change in work habits
or responsibilities. Possible factors underlying these
differences will be discussed later. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Tolerance
and Dependence </h3>

<p>236. Tolerance to the different actions of opiate narcotics
varies with the magnitude and frequency of administration, and
the response being measured. In chronic use, a considerable
degree of tolerance occurs to the sedative, analgesic, euphoric
and respiratory depressant (and, therefore; potentially lethal)
effects; less tolerance develops to the constipating and
pupil-constricting activity. Consequently, persons who are
motivated by the chronic avoidance of pain or other unpleasant
subjective conditions, or perhaps simply by the positive euphoric
effects of the drug, are likely to increase dose and may
eventually tolerate several times the quantity which would be
lethal to a normal individual. Occasional use does not produce
tolerance, however. </p>

<p>237. The degree of physical dependence acquired to these drugs
is closely related to the tolerance developed. With low dose or
infrequent use, little dependency occurs and withdrawal symptoms
may be nonexistent, or merely resemble the symptoms of a mild
flu. Withdrawal of the drug after chronic high-dose use results
in a severe and painful pattern of responses which are similar to
those associated with alcohol and barbiturate dependence
(although it is not as physically dangerous). Usually less than
half a day after the last administration, the dependent begins to
feel irritable, anxious and weak; he sweats and, shivers and his
eyes and nose become watery. A few hours of uneasy sleep may
intervene before he begins the 'cold turkey' phase. The skin
becomes clammy, the pupils dilate, chills, nausea, vomiting, and
severe abdominal cramps occur with uncontrollable defecation;
tremors and, rarely, convulsions may develop. While death has
been reported, fatalities are much rarer than with sedative
withdrawal. The major symptoms of the abstinence syndrome
generally last several days, and gross recovery usually occurs
within about a week, although complete recuperation may take up
to six months .145 Tolerance is eliminated or greatly reduced
with withdrawal. Babies born of dependent mothers are also
physically dependent on the drug, and may die if withdrawal
symptoms are not recognized and treated soon after birth. It
should be noted that the different opiate narcotic drugs have
varying dependence-producing potentials, and physical dependence
is rarely seen in opium smokers or users of codeine (although
strong psychological dependence may occur). </p>

<p>238. Considerable cross-tolerance and cross-dependence exists
among the opiate narcotics. An intravenous injection of any of
these drugs, in sufficient dose, can completely eliminate the
withdrawal syndrome in a matter of minutes. Methadone can prevent
withdrawal symptoms at doses which provide little psychological
effect, and is frequently used in chronic 'maintenance'
programmes designed to rehabilitate dependents. Although the
sedatives and opiate narcotics do not usually show significant
cross-tolerance and dependence, barbiturates can ease the pain of
opiate withdrawal. Nalorphine (Nalline*) antagonizes the effects
of the other opiate narcotics and precipitates the withdrawal
syndrome in dependent individuals. This drug has been used to
'test' for dependence in suspected users. </p>

<p>219. ' The role of physical dependence in the overall picture
of chronic opiate narcotic use has been the subject of much
controversy and many observers feel that the psychological
components are the most important. Some investigators argue that
the fear of withdrawal is often the primary motivating factor
behind continued use, while others emphasize the profound craving
seen in some individuals, or the drug's positive reinforcing or
reward potential. Many dependent persons return to the drug at
some time after withdrawal, and some have occasionally been known
to voluntarily undergo withdrawal in order to lose tolerance (for
economic reasons), and immediately initiate chronic use again, at
a less expensive level. This practice suggests that, with some
individuals, psychological factors other than mere avoidance of
the abstinence syndrome can be dominant in the drug dependence.
Whether this motivation is related to the desire to escape or
avoid a life that is unpleasant, or emotionally painful or
depressing, or perhaps a more directly hedonistic demand for
pleasure or 'kicks', or even a disguised attempt at
self-destruction is not clear - no simple answer could be
expected to have much generality or validity. It has frequently
been observed that some individuals become dependent on the
hypodermic syringe (or 'point') in a way which is, in some
respects, independent of the pharmacological properties of the
drug. Persons showing such conditioning are often called 'needle
freaks'. </p>

<p>240. It is interesting to note that there are only a few
middle-aged persons who are dependent on opiate narcotics. Most
individuals spontaneously lose interest in the drugs before they
turn 45 years of age (barbiturate and alcohol dependents show no
such decline in use). Whether this is due to psychological or
physiological factors is uncertain. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Opiate
Narcotics and Crime </h3>

<p>241. A consensus exists among medical, law enforcement and
research authorities, as well as drug users themselves, that few
crimes of violence are directly produced by the use of the opiate
narcotics. On the other hand, there is a considerable
relationship between crime and opiate narcotic dependence in
North America and many drug dependent persons have non-drug
criminal records. This apparent paradox can be explained by two
important factors. To begin with, both in Canada and in the
United States, many individuals who become dependent on opiate
narcotics have a prior history of behavioural problems and
delinquency and have continued these practices. The second factor
is economical, and is associated with the high cost of heroin on
the black market and the demands made by extended tolerance. </p>

<p>Because of the illegal nature of the drug, the cost of a heavy
heroin habit may run anywhere from $15.00 to $50.00 a day and
higher, in spite of the fact that the medical-cost of the drugs
involved would just be a few cents. There are very few legitimate
ways in which most individuals can afford to meet that kind of an
expense. Consequently, when tolerance pushes the cost of drug use
above what the user can afford legitimately, he is forced into a
decision - either quit the drug and go through withdrawal, or
turn to easier, criminal, methods of acquiring the necessary
money. While many users refuse to become involved in such
activities and stop using the drug, at least temporarily, many
turn to petty crime, small robberies, shoplifting and
prostitution. These are the individuals who regularly come to the
attention of the law enforcement officials. More affluent persons
may be able to support the habit and continue indefinitely
without running afoul of the law. Medical profession dependents,
for example, apparently have less tendency to commit non-drug
offences - perhaps (in addition to predisposing psychological and
sociological factors) because they can often steal with little
risk or purchase the necessary drugs at low cost. </p>

<p>As Jaffe has stated:111 </p>

<p>The popular notions that the morphine addict is necessarily a
cunning, cringing, malicious and degenerate criminal who is
shabbily dressed, physically ill and devoid of the social
amenities, could not be farther from the truth. The addict who is
able to obtain an adequate supply of drugs through legitimate
channels and has adequate funds, usually dresses properly,
maintains his nutrition and is able to discharge his social and
occupational obligations with reasonable efficiency. He usually
remains in good health, suffers little inconvenience and is, in
general, difficult to distinguish from other persons. Good health
and productive work are thus not incompatible with addiction to
opiates. However. ... such continued productivity is the
exception rather than the rule. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">The
Development of Dependence </h3>

<p>242. There have been a number of popular misconceptions about
the pattern of development of opiate narcotic dependence. Rumours
have frequently been heard that marijuana and hashish had been
spiked with heroin to produce opiate addiction in the
unsuspecting user. Similar rumours have been heard about 'spiked'
LSD. In fact, there are no known documented cases in Canada of
opiate narcotic adulteration of other drugs alleged to be pure.
The high price of illicit heroin renders such a hypothesis
extremely improbable. Furthermore, it would be highly unlikely,
if not impossible, for tolerance and dependence to develop
without the user knowing it. The majority of users, both here and
in the United States, were apparently first 'turned-on' by their
friends and peers. Blum (in the United States Task Force Report)
points out:28 </p>

<p>There is no evidence from any study, of initiation as a
consequence of aggressive peddling to innocents who are 'hooked'
against their will or knowledge. . . The popular image of the
fiendish pedlar seducing the innocent child is wholly false. </p>

<p>243. The once popular notion that the opiate narcotic
experience is intrinsically so pleasurable, or that physiological
dependence develops so rapidly, that most who are subjected to it
are promptly addicted is without support. In one experiment,
injections of morphine were given to 150 healthy male volunteers.
Only three were willing to allow repeated administration and none
indicated that he would have actively sought more. The
investigators42 conclude: </p>

<p>. . .opiates are not inherently attractive, euphoric or
stimulant. The danger of addiction to opiates resides in the
person and not the drug. </p>

<p>Lasagna et al 126 also report that the majority of normal
pain-free individuals found effects of opiates quite unpleasant.
Beecher22 reports that only ten per cent of a normal population
liked the morphine experience. Furthermore, many individuals who
developed tolerance and physical dependence in a medical
situation show little interest in the drug experience itself and
tend not to resume use after withdrawal. Even in non-medical
cases, there is evidence that only a small proportion of drug
users who have experimented with opiate narcotics in the streets
become physically dependent on them.42 </p>

<p>244. Many observers contend that certain, social and
personality factors predispose some individuals to drug
dependence and that otherwise normal individuals rarely, if ever,
become chronically dependent. There is considerable evidence that
both the ready availability of the drug and a social milieu
tolerating or encouraging drug use (either medical or
non-medical) are also important factors. Although there are
numerous individuals who have gradually worked up from occasional
'skin popping' to chronic 'mainline' dependence, there is at
present, little evidence that a large proportion of the Canadian
population is running this particular risk. However, there is
cause for apprehension because of the rapidly growing incidence
of heroin use among the young in the United States. Although
there are no known methods of predicting the likelihood of
dependence for any individual at this time, the use of opiate
narcotics involves a risk of considerable proportions for anyone.
</p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Opiate
Narcotics and Other Drugs </h3>

<p>245. In the United States, the opiate narcotic offender coming
to the attention of the law enforcement officials was often
reported to have previously and concurrently been a heavy user of
alcohol, barbiturates, tobacco, and marijuana. In Canada, the
pattern appears to be much more variable and heterogeneous.
Alcohol and barbiturates (and probably tobacco) have apparently
been the drugs most often associated with opiate narcotic use
here246, 215, although recent indications suggest that many new
heroin users may have experience with marijuana and other
psychedelic drugs as well. 170a There are reports that LSD is
generally not popular with regular heroin users, however.41 Some
opiate narcotic users also make use of stimulants such as
amphetamine and cocaine. </p>

<ol>
    <li>Much attention has been and is now being given to the
        'stepping-stone' or 'progression' theory of opiate
        narcotic dependence. Although there is no pharmacological
        basis for the hypothesis that one drug creates a 'need'
        for, or necessarily leads to another, there are numerous
        social factors which might link together the use of
        various drugs. It may well be that the questions of
        'progression' or predisposing experiences can never be
        definitively answered. Like other characteristics
        associated with deviant behaviour, they must be
        continually evaluated anew as the social context changes.
        Some observations on the possible relationship between
        marijuana and opiate narcotic use were presented in the
        previous section on cannabis. </li>

<h2>CHAPTER FOUR </h2>

<h2>SOME CAUSES OF NON-MEDICAL DRUG USE</h2>

<p> </p>

<p>316. The recommendations of the Minister of National Health
and Welfare which gave rise to the appointment of the Commission,
and the Commission's terms of reference, place particular stress
on the desire to understand the causes of the non-medical use of
drugs. We regard our inquiry into these aspects of the phenomenon
to be one of our most important functions. The terms of reference
speak of motivation, and they speak of the social, economic,
educational and philosophical factors that have led to such use. </p>

<p>317. By cause we understand not merely the immediate, direct
motivation for a particular drug experience, but the larger
social significance of the phenomenon - how it relates to various
aspects of life today - family relations, education, work,
institutions, and conditions of life generally. In what way is it
a response to the problems of modern living? What are its
philosophical or spiritual implications? What does it say about
our value structure? How does it reflect the way people think
about the future? </p>

<p>At this time it is clearly impossible to provide a full and
comprehensive statement of cause in these terms. At best we can
hope to convey some of the interpretive themes and to describe
some of the characteristics that have struck us as significant
that seem to have the merit of illuminating from one perspective
or another this complex phenomenon. We seek to do this for a
variety of reasons: to report in general some of our reactions
and impressions; to assist in a preliminary way to add to the
common understanding of a phenomenon that has aroused great
interest, but that has also caused concern and anxiety, and has
brought anguish to many parents; to suggest to citizens,
especially parents and guardians; avenues of approach that may be
helpful to them in understanding with sympathy and perhaps
empathy a social fact that is to them strange and bewildering. </p>

<p>But we must emphasize the to tentative nature of these
comments. They are not to be taken as a conceptual framework for
an understanding of the changes or responses about which we are
concerned. They do not constitute such a framework for the
Commission. They are impressions. We intend to test them as
rigorously as possible by intensive investigation. We invite
critical comment from all quarters. In this way the interim
report may serve a useful dialectical function, assisting us in
consultation with our fellow citizens, to arrive at a full and
sound understanding of this phenomenon. </p>

<p>318. The first problem we face is how to get at the facts of
motivation and other related factors. What are we to accept as
evidence of these facts? These are very subjective matters. Can
we ever be sure that we know the truth? Whether we can or not, it
seems to us that we must rely primarily on what drug users
themselves say about their personal motivation and other factors
predisposing them to use drugs. These statements must be weighed
for credibility and carefully considered for proper
interpretation but they are the primary and best source of an
understanding of motivation. This was the approach followed by
William James in his <i>Varieties of Religious Experience,</i> a
phenomenon which has certain affinities with the subject-matter
of our inquiry. The best evidence of the experience, the
subjective effects of which may be presumed to be the primary
motivation of cause, comes from the words of those who have
undergone it. This is not to say that insight cannot be gained
from the observations and interpretations of psychologists,
social philosophers, sociologists and other informed and
qualified students of our society. Thus we shall have recourse,
in trying to explain this phenomenon, to both the words of drug
users and the interpretations of observers. Finally, we shall
offer our own interpretation, although this can only be a
tentative one at this time - one that is offered as a basis for
further consideration and discussion by the people of Canada. </p>

<p>319. Our inquiry has taken several forms: the public hearing
of the traditional kind in which briefs have been submitted but
in which there has been a full opportunity for questioning and
discussion by everyone present; private hearings with groups and
individuals; numerous discussions with drug users and various
experts having not only theoretical insight into the problem but
active points of contact with it through some professional
involvement; presentation of evidence regarding law enforcement
and correction; and we have heard from experts in the areas of
education; medical services; family life and social welfare.
Although we intend to inquire further into motivation (as well as
extent of use, perception of the problem, and general attitudes)
in the surveys to be carried out this year, we do not necessarily
rely on the answers to survey questionnaires as the most reliable
evidence of motivation. Motivation is too subtle, complex, and
full of nuance to be adequately elicited through questionnaires.
We place as much or more reliance on the impressions derived from
hearing individual drug users speak at length in public and
private meetings about their experience and what they think to be
the causes. In many ways we are closer here to the art of the
novelist than that of the social scientist. We can only offer
hypotheses - the validity and acceptance of which will depend on
their ability to make sense of this phenomenon - to provide a
meaning which is satisfactory to Canadians. It is like the
ultimate test of any philosophy or religion. But it is important
to emphasize once again that what is recorded here is merely our
first impression gleaned from initial contacts during the first
six months or so of our inquiry. </p>

<p>320. The explanations of motivation and the other related
factors vary considerably. They vary between the different
drug-using populations and they vary within a particular
population. It is idle to seek a single, unifying explanation or
theory. This whole area is characterized by bewildering diversity
and conflicting impressions, but certain dominant themes do seem
to emerge. </p>

<p>321. The motivational patterns underlying drug use also vary
to some extent from drug to drug. In the case of cannabis, a
major factor appears to be the simple pleasure of the experience.
Time after time witnesses have said to us in effect: 'We do it
for fun. Do not try to find a complicated explanation for it. We
do it for pleasure.' This is the explanation frequently offered
for the use of cannabis, particularly by college students and
adults in the working world. A mother of four and a teacher said:
'When I smoke grass I do it in the same social way that I take a
glass of wine at dinner or have a drink at a party. I do not feel
that it is one of the great and beautiful experiences of my life,
I simply feel that it is pleasant and I think it ought to be
legalized.' </p>

<p>A person involved in work with drug users expressed it this
way: 'I think maybe it is time we stopped all the sociological
nonsense about social milieux, and how your daddy fell off a
horse, and how your mommy burnt the pablum or whatever it is - or
what kind of sociological trip you want to blast off on, and just
say in front what you mean which is &quot;I get loaded because I
love to do it&quot;.' </p>

<p>322. Many of us think of human behaviour in general as a
consequence of needs that are either inherited or learned. There
is some tendency to think of behaviour such as drug use as a
consequence of pathological need patterns. However, we feel it
would be a serious error, at least as far as cannabis use is
concerned, to think of use as symbolic of or manifesting a
pathological, psychological or even sociological state. Simple
pleasure, similar to that claimed for the moderate use of
alcohol, or food, or sex, is frequently offered as the general
explanation for most current drug use. This is particularly true
of the growing number of adult users (who share perhaps little
else but their taste for cannabis with the members of the 'hip'
culture). It is no doubt true that for some the use of drugs is a
reflection of personal and social problem. But the desire for
certain kinds of psychological gratification or release is not
peculiar to the drug user or to our generations. It is an old and
universal theme of human history. Man has always sought
gratifications of the kind afforded by the psychotropic drugs. </p>

<p>323. They will vary with the particular drug used and, to some
extent, with the personality of the user. In the case of <i>cannabis,
</i>the positive points which are claimed for it include the
following: it is a relaxant, it is disinhibiting; it increases
self-confidence and the feeling of creativity (whether justified
by objective results or not); it increases sensual awareness and
appreciation; it facilities concentration and gives one a greater
sense of control over time; it facilitates this way makes it
easier to accept others; it serves a sacramental function in
promoting a sense of spiritual community among users; it is a
shared pleasure; because it is illicit and the object of strong
disapproval from those who are, by and large, opposed<i> </i>to
social change, it is a symbol of protest and a means of
strengthening the sense of identity among those who are strongly
critical of certain aspects of our society and value structure
today. </p>

<p>324. Those who have used cannabis are not unanimous in its
praise, although clearly the vast majority am to regard it as
either a harmless pastime or the source of real advantages and
gain. Those who have used the drug and then criticize it tend
most often to say it can dominate a weak personality; it can take
too much time; it can become an excuse for procrastination; it
lessens the ability to persevere with unpleasant, boring or
routine tasks. </p>

<p>325. Often a cannabis user has said, 'We can't explain it to
you. Why don't you try it?' It has been implied that there is
something ineffable about the experience, although this is more
often the case when speaking of the effects of LSD. Sometimes one
wonders if what is being conveyed is not a certain sense of
exclusiveness, a smugness of the initiated. But we prefer to
believe that it is the subtle and multifaceted aspect of its
psychological and social significance for the average user that
makes words seem inadequate to convey the whole of its meaning.
Indeed, many users have insisted that the makers of cannabis are
able to communicate without the use of words; that they recognize
and understand one another and share important assumptions and
attitudes. Whether this silent communication is more than the
knowledge of a common experience is not clear. But users speak of
a sense of affinity, a larger consciousness, of which they are
made to feel a party by the drug experience. </p>

<p>326. Thus there is unquestionably a strong suggestion of
community, of cultural solidarity, among cannabis users. And
there is a definite tendency to proselytize, to encourage others
to take up the practice. It may be partly due to the illicit
status of the practice which makes users want to increase the
numbers involved and thus the concern of society about its
present policy. But there is also a definite impression that the
cannabis user seeks to convert others to what he sincerely
believes to be a superior outlook and life style. The smoking of
cannabis becomes a rite of initiation to a new society and value
system. These are aspects of cannabis use, particularly among the
younger, more idealistic members of our society, which merit
serious consideration in any attempt to measure its potential for
growth. </p>

<p>327. We gather from the statements of cannabis users that the
drug is predominantly used in groups to enhance, enrich and ease
social intercourse. However, the statements of LSD users imply
that their experience is much more. LSD is spoken of as a very
profound experience, not to be lightly entered into. With some it
is never to be repeated; with others, its profound character, the
sense of venture into the unknown, the very real risks of adverse
effect, make it a practice which seems likely to remain fairly
restricted. It is cheaper than psychoanalysis but appears to
carry with it some of the same implications- the promise of
greater, self-knowledge and self-acceptance but at the same time
uncertainty as to the personality that will emerge. Except for a
relatively few devotees, LSD is not a regular experience having
social or communal significance. It is rather a venture into
self-discovery which sometimes takes on turning point
significance for the subject. The self-revelation experienced may
or may not become a basis for attitudinal change. It is thus a
foundational experience rather than a casual one, as is the case
of cannabis. </p>

<p>328. It is with reference to LSD that the most serious claims
for spiritual significance are made, Timothy Leary has spoken in
terms of a new quest for religious truth and experience. 'It's
the same old pursuit. The aims of our religion are those of every
religion of the past: we work to find the God within, the
divinity which lies within each person's body.'1 Users frequently
speak of the LSD experience in mystical terms. There is repeated
testimony to a feeling of oneness with others - of a loss of the
sense of personal identity in a sense of being a part of
everything that is around one. There is a pantheistic sense of
affinity and identification. </p>

<p>329. While pleasure, curiosity, the desire to experiment, and
even the sense of adventure, are dominant motivations in drug
use, there is no doubt that a search for self-knowledge and
self-integration and for spiritual meanings are strong
motivations with many. We have been profoundly impressed by the
natural and unaffected manner in which drug users have responded
to the question of religious significance. They are not
embarrassed by the mention of God. Indeed, as Paul Goodman has
observed, their reactions are in interesting contrast to those of
the 'God is dead' theologian. It may be an exaggeration to say
that we are witnessing the manifestations of a genuine religious
revival, but there does appear to be a definite revival of
interest in the religious or spiritual attitude towards life. As
one drug user put it: 'The whole culture is saying, &quot;Where
is God?&quot; I don't believe in your institutions, but now I
know it's there someplace.' Another witness said, 'I just find
that a lot of people are becoming a lot more aware of what's
happening and joining in on a universal cause, a cosmic sort of
joyousness and people are getting interested in spiritual things
as well, because this is what our generation and the previous
generations have lacked&#133;.' </p>

<p>330. Drug use is by no means indispensable to the new outlook.
Some people are fortunate enough to be what users call a natural
'turn on'. It is conceded that you can be 'turned on' without
drugs - vital, human, and aware of all your senses, enjoying
authentic, non-exploitative human relations, and alive to beauty
and the possibilities of the moment. Indeed, there is an active
doctrine of transcendence which sees drug use as a catalytic or
transitional thing to be abandoned as soon as it has enabled you
to glimpse another way of looking at things and of relating to
life and people. The doctrine of transcendence carries much hope
for the future. One witness said.- 'I don't do too many drugs
anymore because I have gone beyond them. They have taught me the
lesson and there isn't so much need for them any more. I mean
it's still fun to get stoned but there's a lot more to it. There
is more to it than just fun. After you have learned the lesson,
you have fun in virtually anything.' </p>

<p>331. Many users have stated that the insights gained through
drug use have carried over and remained with them, continuing to
shape their attitudes and outlook and style of relating when they
were not using drugs. In other words the drug has been a means of
discovering a new way to be more relaxed and self-accepting, more
accepting and indeed loving, more appreciative of the intensity
and value of being human in the moment, less anxious about time
and specific goals. In listening to these statements one can not
help feeling that this discovery was often made in other ways in
the past - through traditional religious experience, for
instance. </p>

<p>Modern drug use would definitely seem to be related in some
measure to the collapse of religious values - the ability to find
a religious meaning of fife. The positive values that young
people claim to find in the drug experience bear a striking
similarity to traditional religious values, including the concern
with the soul, or inner self. The spirit of renunciation, the
emphasis on openness and the closely knit community, are part of
it, but there is definitely the sense of identification with
something larger, something to which one belongs as part of the
human race. </p>

<p>332. Young drug users are highly critical of many aspects of
our modern life. In this they are perhaps not much different,
than the critical minority that one finds in each generation. But
one has its own unique history and has lived through a formative
period unlike any other. What are the distinguishing features of
that background? In what way is it truly different from the one
which shaped the outlook of previous generations of young people?
The distinguishing marks would seem to be: a generalized
middle-class affluence, a very rapid rate of technological
change; the oppressive, almost foreboding character of certain
problems or menaces which cast a serious doubt about man's
ability to survive - nuclear power, overpopulation, environmental
pollution, racial hostility and the widening gap between wealth
and poverty. All these and other aspects of the human predicament
today impart a distinctive character to the outlook and response
of our youth. An example of the criticism of the economic system
is the following statement by a university student: </p>

<p>I think it is essential that there should be some manner by
which we could break down the economic system. We still need
productivity. But you can get away from the economic basis, from
the competitive basis on which people, once they have gone into
something, have to beat you down. You have this aspect of wanting
to share which we should develop. You should be willing to share
together. But you can still have productivity without
competition. </p>

<p>333. To this point we have been concerned largely with the
statements and interpretations of drug users themselves. We turn
now to interpretation - our own and that of other commentators.
Present-day affluence plays a curious role. Without it there
could not be the freedom for speculation and experiment - the
luxury of cultivating the inner self. At the same time it repels.
It is both taken for granted and repudiated. There is a love-hate
relationship. The drug-taking minority of this generation cannot
be inspired by the goals of their fathers. They do not feel the
same urgency to achieve material success and do not seek
self-fulfilment that way. It may be that they see no way of
achieving their own sense of personal identity in attempting to
repeat, probably with less success, what their fathers have
already done. There is reason to believe that young people from
less comfortable circumstances are more strongly motivated
towards traditional career patterns and material success. But
there would seem to be more than merely trying to find a role
different from that of one's father. The materially more
sophisticated young people, those more familiar with material
well-being and less anxious about their ability to maintain it,
think they see a future in which it will be impossible to avoid.
They envisage a society which will be obliged to assure a
sufficient amount of material security to everyone in order to
maintain itself politically and economically. They therefore
conclude that it is a goal for which it is now unnecessary to
plan or to which it is futile to devote a significant amount of
ones time and energy. </p>

<p>334. There is also a strong impression that young people are,
as it were, unconsciously adapting time when there will be much
less work to go around. The rapid rate of technological change
and the pervading threat of work obsolescence makes them very
uncertain about their own occupational future. They seem to
suspect that a high proportion of them may have to learn to live
happily with relatively little work. Those of us who are
well-established in work tend to talk glibly of a future in which
there will be increasing leisure. Little thought or practical
effort has been devoted to the problem of how to fill that
leisure in constructive and satisfying ways. The exploration of
the inner self, the expansion of consciousness, the development
of spiritual potential, may well be purposes to which young
people are turning in anticipation of a life in which they will
have to find sustaining interest in the absence of external
demands and challenges. </p>

<p>335. Young people speak often of a desire to overcome the
division of life into work and play, to achieve a way of life
that is less divided, less seemingly schizophrenic, and more
unified, They seem to be talking about the increasingly rare
privilege of work that one can fully enjoy - of work that is like
one's play. They claim to he prepared to make considerable
renunciations or sacrifice of traditional satisfactions like
status and material success for work in which they can take
pleasure. Indeed, one of their frequent commentaries on the older
generation is that it does not seem to enjoy its work, that it
does not seem to be happy. This is said sadly, even
sympathetically. It is not said contemptuously. The young say, in
effect, 'Why should we repeat this pattern?' The use of drugs for
many is part of a largely hedonistic life style in which
happiness and pleasure are taken as self-evidently valid goals of
human life. </p>

<p>336. Role rejection is an important theme of the cultural
reaction that is associated with much of contemporary drug use.
One young person suggested that letting one's hair grow was in
part at least a rejection of the manhood role. Young people do
not deny the historic validity or necessity of these roles for
the older generation nor the positive achievements which must be
credited to them; they simply say that they are no longer
relevant or desirable. The role which many reject is that of the
achievement-oriented male, committed, body and soul to the big
corporation, and feeling increasingly the need to give proofs of
his masculinity. Some have spoken of drugs as dehabituating,
desophisticating, and deconceptualizing - as helping the
personality to break out of old moulds. They speak of a release
or recovery of child-like innocence - the essential perspective
of the artist. </p>

<p>337. There can be no doubt that there is a search for
authenticity in thought, in stance, in personal relations. The
drug becomes a means of dissolving the mask, of escaping from
pretence, affectation and stereotyped reaction and attitude,
although their place may be taken by other stereotypes - a
cultist enthusiasm which expresses itself in knowing smiles and a
private language. What happens under LSD is far from clear, but
users speak of blowing holes in the conscious mind through which
bits of the subconscious emerge, to be always accessible in the
future. It is the language of self-discovery - the eternal search
for the main-springs of one's personality - the attempt to find
liberation from psychological burdens, from 'hang ups', as they
are popularly called. </p>

<p>These human desires, these goals, are not new: they may be
summed up as the attempt to become a 'real person'. This has been
a goal of religious or spiritual concern down through the
centuries; the attempt to pull together the dispersed or
fragmented pieces of the self. It is often expressed as the
search for an identity. </p>

<p>338. There is in man a powerful and long-term tendency to
attempt to weave the experience and perceptions of the individual
into a logically consistent whole, centred when possible on a
single cosmological principle or theme. In such a whole, man
seeks for a meaning to life in the broad sense, for goals towards
which to direct himself and the means by which he can reasonably
hope to attain these goals. Through such a structure man hopes to
find the nature of his own relationship to existence in general
and to his fellows. When such a synthesis of experience is
available, not only to an individual but in a form that can be
shared and accepted by some large numbers of people, it can
become the ideological basis for social life and, as such, serve
as a unifying principle for a society. Such syntheses of
experiences were achieved by minds such as those of Saint Thomas
Aquinas, John Calvin and Karl Marx. In the absence of such
syntheses, man and society suffer. The responses that are made by
man in periods of ideological vacuum often appear strikingly
similar. For instance, there seem to be striking parallels
between the orientation of the stoics and cynics at the time of
the collapse of the Greek world, and the response of the 'Beat
Generation' and the 'Hippies'. In both instances the individual
seems to withdraw from his society and to seek reality within
himself. </p>

<p>339. Are there special elements in the present human situation
that impose particular stresses and burdens that would account
for the increasing dependence of old and young on drugs? In this
context we repeatedly encounter the term 'alienation'. The use of
this term has been discussed by Kenneth Keniston in these words:2
</p>

<p>Although formal discussions of alienation itself are largely
limited to the last 150 years, the theme of alienation - of
estrangement, outcastness and loss - is an archetypal theme in
human life and history.... The ambiguous concept of alienation
has in recent years become increasingly fashionable and, partly
as result, increasingly devoid of any specific meaning. More and
more the term is used to characterize whatever the author
considers the dominant maladies of the twentieth century; and
since views differ as to what these maladies are, the meaning of
alienation fluctuates with each writer. . . . Writers like Fromm,
Kahler and Pappenheim use 'alienation' to describe a variety of
conditions ranging from separation of man from nature to the loss
of pre-capitalist work relationships, from man's defensive use of
language to his estrangement from his own creative potential, and
from the worker's loss of control over the productive process to
the individual's feeling of social or political powerlessness. Of
course, the purpose of such writers is to suggest that all of
these different phenomena are connected, that all result from
some characteristic of modern society. </p>

<p>In the testimony we have heard, the term 'alienation' is most
often used to refer to the estrangement of many young people and
adults from the institutions, processes and dominant economic,
social and political values of our society; to this inability to
think of a good and meaningful life being available to them in
the society; to their sense of inability to affect or influence
the course that society will follow or the great issues of peace
and war, poverty, pollution and others. </p>

<p>340. Many of our modern youth are undoubtedly suffering from
too great self-expectation. This is partly the result of
exaggerated paternal expectation - parents confusing their own
affluence (which may be as often the product of an aggressive
acquisitiveness as innate intelligence) with the inherited
characteristics which they are capable of passing on. It is also
partly the result of a sense of wider opportunity reflected in
universal education. More is possible; more is expected. There
develops a disquieting gap between expectation and ability. Dr
Vivian Rakoff said: 'We use drugs to find out how far we can go,
rather than as a device for passivity. Drugs can be a spurious
way to fill the gap between aspiration and capacity.' </p>

<p>341. Witnesses appearing before the Commission have sometimes
referred to the word <i>'anomie' </i>to express one of the
possible 'causes' of the non-medical use of drugs. Whether these
speakers referred to the literal 'Anomie' or to some other state
of confusion or estrangement closer to 'alienation' is not easy
to determine. But, in fact, and in any case, the Commission was
told that a certain anomie in which the Canadian society lives
does call for a response, a reaction: self-search, integration,
new values, evasion, etc. Literally, anomie means 'normlessness'.
This state, well described by the French sociologist, Emile
Durkheim (especially in relation to suicide), does not often
result from the total absence of norms but emerges from the
co-existence of conflicting norms, rendering the aiming towards
precise goals very difficult; contradicting values are expressing
themselves through co-existing norms. </p>

<p>The Commission thinks that the concept of anomie and the
existence of anomie situations may be part of the explanation
that it will be trying to discern, in the course of its mandate.
However, anomie and alienation are used all encompassingly as two
of the 'causes' of nearly all social problems,<b> </b>these
concepts will have to be treated carefully, and critically. The
term 'anomie' is neither specific nor very useful operationally
(it cannot account for a specific problem. e.g., How is it that
all people living under anomic conditions do not resort to
drugs?) </p>

<p>342. Contemporary drug use is also associated with a loss of
faith in reason and a new emphasis on emotion. As one young high
school student put it, 'Young people today want to learn feelings
more than facts.' Paul Goodman has described the loss of faith
thus:3 </p>

<p>There is a lapse of faith in science. Science has not produced
the general happiness that people expected, and now it has come
under the sway of greed and power; whatever its beneficent past,
people fear that its further progress will do more harm than
good. And rationality itself is discredited. Probably it is more
significant than we like to think that intelligent young people
dabble in astrology, witchcraft, psychedelic dreams, and whatever
else is despised by science; in some sense they are not kidding.
They need to control their fate, but they hate scientific
explanations. </p>

<p>Keniston has spoken of a 'cult of experience' and declares:4 </p>

<p>Central to this cult is a focus on the present - on today, on
the here-and-now. Thus, rather than to defer gratification and
enjoyment for a distant future, immediate pleasure and
satisfaction are emphasized. Rather than reverence for the
traditions of the past, experience in the present is stressed.
Psychologically, then, such human qualities as control, planning,
waiting, saving, and postponing on the one hand, and revering,
recalling, remembering and respecting on the other, are equally
de-emphasized. In contrast, activity, adventure, responsiveness,
genuineness, spontaneity and sentience are the new experimental
values. Since neither the future nor the past can be assumed to
hold life's meaning, the meaning of life must be sought within
present experience, within the self, within its activity and
responsiveness in the here-and-now. </p>

<p>343. This emphasis on feeling, and immediate experience
reflects itself in an interest in the arts and in nature. Many
young people speak of a heightened appreciation of the beauties
of nature. This is related to the aesthetic repugnance they feel
towards many of the physical aspects of modern urban life. One<b>
</b>student said that he did not feel any desire for drugs for
two weeks when he was on a canoe trip in the Canadian north. The
drugs may often be an attempt to escape from a pervading urban
ugliness into a world of interior beauty. </p>

<p>344. We suspect that much contemporary drug use simply serves
the purpose of relieving the stress and tension which most
people, young and old, experience in modern living. Certainly
this is a dominant function of alcohol and nicotine which are
still the most prevalent drugs in all age groups, (see Chapter
Three). It is also true of the large quantities of barbiturates
consumed by adults. In the vast majority of cases it is idle to
look beyond the relief of tension for an explanation. This is the
pleasure or gratification most generally sought by the drug
user.5 </p>

<p>Chemical comforts are extremely varied in their chemical
nature, but what they do have in common is their ability to
produce pleasure. In this it can be noted that people only become
dependent on substances which they report produce pleasure and
the dependency potential of any substance, drug or food, may be
predicted by seeing how much pleasure it gives to the patient.
The pleasure they produce is reduction of tension, in addition to
any other social or physical effects they might have. </p>

<p>345. Some commentators have identified a degree of strain that
is peculiar to the impact of communications in our age. Keniston
has referred to it as 'stimulus flooding and psychological
numbing'. Dr Paul Christie, the superintendent of the Queen
Street Mental Health Centre in Toronto has spoken of 'chronic
confusion'. As Keniston puts it: 6 </p>

<p>One of the conditions of life in any modern technological
society is continual sensory, intellectual, and emotional
stimulation which produces or requires a<b> </b>high tendency
towards psychological numbing&#133; the quantity, intensity and
variety of inputs to which the average American is subjected in
an average day probably has no precedent in any other historical
society.... The problem arises, however, because the shells we
erect to protect ourselves from the clamours of the inner and
outer world often prove harder and less permeable than we had
originally wanted.... Thus, in at least a minority of Americans,
the normal capacity to defend oneself against undue stimulation
and inner excitation is exaggerated and automatized, so that it
not only protects but walls off the individual from inner and
outer experience ... the feeling and fear of psychological
numbing leads to a pursuit, even a cult, of experiences for its
own sake. </p>

<p>346. Many observers tend to characterize the psychological
predisposition to the use of <i>methamphetamines </i>('speed') as
one of deep depression. Wilfrid Clement, who has had extensive
clinical experience with 'speed freaks', has expressed the
opinion that 'we are faced with major generalized social
depression as a reaction to our technological society'. Both Mr
Herb Tookey and Mr Barry Luger, who have had a great deal of
contact with the 'speed' community through their work with <i>The
Trailer </i>in Toronto (see Chapter Six), have emphasized this
depression. Tookey says, 'The methedrine user is usually
chronically depressed with a passive-dependent personality.'7 The
depression seems to come from the feeling of powerlessness and
inability to cope with various environmental problems and the
demands of modern life. Luger puts it this way: 'Most potential
speed freaks are depressed because of their past environmental
and institutional problems and see no positive experiences in the
foreseeable future. They were not able to cope with the problems
at home, at school or with their middle-class group.'8 The
depression, Tookey says, is 'often manifested behaviourally by a
lack of goal orientated behaviour. The methedrine user has
considerable difficulty in constructing and carrying out long
range plans (i.e. getting and maintaining a job, going to school,
etc.)' The feeling of being able to cope is very important.
'Coupled with chronic depression', says Tookey, 'is episodic
angry agitation which appears to result from, feelings of
impotency, rejection, inferiority, and lack of control over the
environment.'9 </p>

<p>The 'speed freak' can be seen as a casualty of the increasing
complexity of the demands for adaptation and survival in a
technological society. Says Tookey, 'The &quot;speed freak&quot;
usually hits poor interpersonal skills and invariably is unable
to make the discriminations necessary to deal with a complex
technological society.'10 Clement sees the problem as one of
adaptation in a time of rapid change and contrasts the 'speed
freak' with what he calls the 'super-adaptive' youth. Clement
expresses the view that the 'speed freak's' depression relates to
his perception of his peers and their relative ability to cope
with the demands on them - not only the demands of the
educational system but also the demands of social adaptation.
They experience anxiety about their function and identity in the
future. They can see peers able to tolerate the speed and
bewildering demands of modern life. The sight of the
'super-adaptive' peer fills the average young person with a sense
of inadequacy. The contrast in abilities is shown most clearly in
after-school activity - in response to the demands of
sociability. </p>

<p>The desire for a supportive, reinforcing community is a strong
motivation for the use of speed. 'For the vast majority', says
Tookey, 'the speed community provides a very strong, though
anonymous identity. Paradoxically, identity is found by losing
personal identity to the group. &quot;I'm a speed freak&quot;.'11
The speed freak community has few moral standards but it shows a
rough loyalty to its members. John Bradford, President of
Rochdale College, said, 'One reason why kids use speed is that
they are trying to imitate a life style they're not part of and
don't understand.' He was referring to the life style of the
'heads' - the users of psychedelics. </p>

<p>347. Many young people profess to have little belief in the
future - to find it difficult to visualize a future for
themselves. In one small group we met with during our hearings
one of the women said, 'Very few in our generation believe we are
going to live to be forty.' There was general agreement in the
group, with this statement. Paul Goodman in his article, <i>'The
New Reformation', </i>has emphasized this point: 'Again and again
students have told me that they take it for granted they will not
survive the next ten years. '12 </p>

<p>348. There is also a suggestion that this emphasis on
experience in the present reflects a reaction against the
constraints on the personality produced by the habit-forming,
role-imposing, conformity of modern society. It is a reaction
against role and rule - an attempt to find spontaneity, variety,
and unstructured expression in personality and experience. This
reflects again the importance of the dehabituating effect of the
drugs - their capacity to break down moulds into which behaviour
and personality are threatened with confinement by the various
pressures towards conformity. Benjamin DeMott has written very
perceptively of this reaction in an article entitled <i>'The
Sixties: A Cultural Revolution'. </i>He emphasizes that it is
common to all age groups. DeMott sums up this new longing and
reaching out which cuts across all age groups as: 13 </p>

<p>The will to possess one's experience rather than be possessed
by it, the longing to live one's own life rather than be lived by
it, the drive for a more various selfhood than men have known
before. ... Young, old, black, white, rich and poor are pursuing
the dream of a more vital experience ... at the root of our
yearning stand the twin convictions: that we can be more, as men,
than we're permitted to be by the rule of role and profession,
and that the life of dailiness and habit, the life that lives us,
precedes us, directs us to the point of suppressing moral
conscience and imagination, is in truth no life at all. </p>

<p>One witness reflected something of the same emphasis in his
explanation of the effects of drugs: </p>

<p>Marijuana makes a person child-like. LSD and mescaline are a
ticket to childhood. They are desophisticators, they break down
the conceptual structure through which the person interprets or
views the world. Categories which were always perfectly
acceptable are now of questionable value, things which were never
noticed or were always taken for granted now jump out to the
person presenting unsolvable metaphysical problems. Every event
has deep meaning, every thought is profound. </p>

<p>349. This phenomenon can also be viewed from the perspectives
of psychiatry and abnormal psychology. There are many in the
public who tend to view the non-medical use of drugs as
symptomatic of a pathological psychological state. There is no
doubt but that some of those who use drugs such as cannabis or
LSD are mentally ill; this is also true of some proportion of
those who use alcohol and the mental illness is causative to some
degree of their use. However, it is the view of the Commission
that the majority of drug users do not take drugs as a result of
pathological motivation. Nevertheless it is desirable to draw
attention to some of the psychological and psychiatric problems
that are suggested to be contributing factors underlying
non-medical drug use. </p>

<p>350. From the psychological point of view, overstimulation and
exposure to an overwhelming stressful and complex environment,
which requires the individual to perform too many and too
difficult differentiations and to solve problems which surpass
his coping ability, are likely to lead to a disturbance ('a
jamming') of his capacity to deal effectively with the excessive
in-put to his central nervous system. In animals, such situations
produce pathological states of maladaptive behaviour which are
often referred to as 'experimental neuroses'. In man, it is
likely that similar mechanisms prevail, and pathological states
of neurosis or personality disorder, even psychosis, may develop
under these conditions. </p>

<p>Looking once more at the experimental animal model, it is
interesting that animals whose behaviour has become severely
disturbed through environmentally-produced stress can be
temporarily 'normalized' by the administration of tranquillizing
drugs. Animals under these conditions prefer, in fact, water with
added alcohol or tranquillizing drugs to plain water. </p>

<p>This suggests that severely disturbed humans, too, may often
resort to drugs which produce relaxation of 'instant rest'<b> </b>as
a temporary escape from intolerable tensions in a world which
offers less and less natural opportunities to do so. It is
noteworthy and apparently paradoxical, that amphetamines - the
stimulating 'speed' drugs - are among the most effective medical
means of alleviating states of pathological nervous over-activity
in children, and that these drugs can often help such children to
regain increased self-confidence and greater powers of
concentration. Claims for similar effects of 'speed' are often
made by the teenager who is plagued by the awareness of his own
inadequacy. This may be interpreted as the choice of a different
'chemical defence' against the threat of an overwhelming
environment - instead of 'instant rest', the young person chooses
'instant efficiency'. Thus, the non-medical use of psychotropic
drugs may frequently be an abortive and poorly directed attempt
by an emotionally sick person to treat his own condition. But
because he does not know precisely how, when and in what dosage
to apply these drugs, he not only usually fails in his attempts
but more often than not makes things worse. </p>

<p>351. In the language of ego psychology, a person's ability to
cope with external demands depends on his ego structure; that is,
that part of the personality which mediates between inner needs
and outer reality. Ego strength, in turn, depends on undisturbed
processes of growth, development and maturation throughout
childhood. Since a child is an extremely vulnerable organism,
disruptive early experiences may lead to imbalanced development
and result in a poorly adjusted personality structure. Such a
maladjusted person would then be inadequately equipped to deal
with the complex demands of today's world. </p>

<p>352. The Commission has very often been told by young people
that they reject all that is traditional conventional and
stereotyped, because they consider it to be hypocritical, phony,
dehumanizing, threatening, and ugly. As a result, they may,
become alienated and some may be plunged into a frantic search
for an identity which may be acceptable to them by their own
standards. This search for identity may go in two directions, one
leading to a pathological adjustment - the other simply to a
non-pathological parting from conformity. </p>

<p>In the pathological outcome, the individual may substitute a
spurious identity for an authentic one, for instance, by
accepting his belonging to a drug community as his new identity.
Also, by displacing his inner needs, projecting his aspirations
and denying his limitations, the person might settle for a
drug-induced illusion of false power, rather than real
achievement, and for chemically induced comfort rather than true
resolution of conflicts and tensions. </p>

<p>By contrast, in the non-pathological choice, the drug user may
opt exclusively for the inner world of personal experience and
genuine emotional awareness instead of the despised external
hall-marks of success in the world of our present-day society, as
we have often been told by young people. In making this choice,
the young individual apparently replaces the prevailing social,
technological and scientific values which require consensual
verification, with the immanent and immutable values of
emotional, interpersonal, spiritual, creative - but not
necessarily productive - achievement. It might well be reassuring
to him that personal experience, emotional awareness,
spirituality and creativeness are forever free from the danger of
being usurped by dehumanizing automation (the one power the
neo-nonconformist hates and fears perhaps more than anything
else, as we have repeatedly been told). However, this choice of
deliberate withdrawal and restructuring of his value system is
probably only open to a highly differentiated, sensitive and
introspective person. </p>

<p>353. Many others who reject today's society probably do so for
more personal and less philosophical reasons - for instance,
because of unresolved conflicts with their parents and with
authority in general. Many also adopt more pathological defences,
rather than an orderly withdrawal, as their way of rejecting the
'establishment'. Such defences - when induced and sustained by
psychotropic drugs - may consist in the vicarious building of an
illusionary world with LSD or in frenzied and aggressive
overstimulation with the help of 'speed', or in a passive walling
off and isolation of the self from all contacts, with cannabis. </p>

<p>354. Even more pathological responses may occur as disguised
self-destructive behaviour. For instance, some 'speed' users who
inject almost suicidal doses of methamphetamine into their veins
without any regard for their safety and health, may actually be
trying to test the truth of the youth slogan 'Speed Kills'. The
role of the doomed person who is at once a martyr sacrificing
himself, a hero braving the confrontation with certain
destruction and a gambler playing dice with death, is a role
which seems to have a strong seductive pull for some young people
who are morbidly hungry for compassion, admiration and
excitement. For these individuals the slogan 'Speed Kills', may,
paradoxically, carry more attractive than deterrent power - and
thus may not serve the purpose for which it is being promoted. </p>

<p>355. The sick individual who relies on cannabis, speed or
other psychotropic drugs, almost as his only means of escape, who
uses them always as a crutch, and structures his whole existence
around them as the only providers of pleasure (the 'pothead', the
'speed-freak, and the 'acidhead'), is in need of medical and
psychiatric, or psychological treatment. Prolonged counselling,
psychotherapy and comprehensive social follow-up care are usually
required. Medically prescribed and supervised drug treatment may
also be indicated in many cases. </p>

<p>On the other hand, the neo-noncomformist who is using drugs
but is not sick in the medical or psychiatric sense, may not need
treatment. If it seems desirable to bring about a change in his
behaviour, only a philosophical and spiritual reorientation,
which would have to touch the cultural roots of his values and
existential attitudes, could achieve this goal. </p>

<h1>Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report</h1>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p><b>by Tod Mikuriya, M.D.<br>
</b></p>

<hr>

<p>The Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report*, comprising some nine
volumes and 3,698 pages, is by far the most completed and
systematic study of marijuana undertaken to date. Because of the
rarity and, perhaps, the formidable size of this document, the
wealth of information contained in it has not found its way into
contemporary writings on this subject. This is indeed
unfortunate, as many of the issues concerning marijuana being
argued in the United States today were dealt with in the Indian
Hemp Drugs Commission Report. </p>

<p>It is both surprising and gratifying to note the timeless and
lucid quality of the writings of these British bureaucrats. It
would be fortunate if studies undertaken by contemporary
commissions, task force committees and study groups could measure
up to the standards of thoroughness and general objectivity
embodied in this report. In the current context of violently
polarized attitudes toward marijuana, the prospect of a study of
similar stature would be improbably if not impossible.<br>
</p>

<p><b>History of British Involvement<br>
</b></p>

<p>The British government in India had substantial knowledge of
intoxicants other than alcohol because of their active
involvement in regulation, taxation and actual trafficking in
these substances for over a hundred years prior to the Hemp Drugs
Commission investigation and report. </p>

<p>In 1790 duties on alcohol and other intoxicant drugs were
first levied by the British on Landlords in India. The regulation
of cannabis preparations was further specified in 1793 in
regulation XXXIV of that year: &quot;No personal shall
manufacture or vend any such drugs (bhang* ganja**, charas*** and
other intoxicating drugs) without a license from the collector of
the zillah_.&quot; </p>

<p>This system of regulation was instituted &quot;with a view to
check immoderation consumption, and at the same time to augment
the public revenue.&quot; </p>

<p>In 1800 in a further modification of regulation, the
manufacture and sale of charas was prohibited as &quot;being of a
most noxious quality,&quot; while daily rates of duty were
declared as the basis for taxing procedures. Curiously, in 1824
the restriction on charas was rescinded &quot;as this drug was
found on examination to be not more prejudicial to health than
ganja or other intoxicating drugs.&quot; </p>

<p>In 1849 limits on retail sale of cannabis drugs were fixed
&quot;for better securing the abkari__ revenue of Calcutta,&quot;
and later extended to the
__________________________________________________________ </p>

<p>* Leaves and flowers of wild growing or inferior cultivated
cannabis plants. </p>

<p>** Flowering tops of the cannabis plant </p>

<p>*** Resin from the mature cannabis plant </p>

<p>_ A county-sized district or administrative division (India) </p>

<p>__ Manufacture or sale of intoxicating Liquors or drugs;
hence, an excise or internal revenue tax on such manufacture of
sale (India) </p>

<p>[Abkar: A wine seller; distiller. Also, one whose trade is
subject to abkari tax]<br>
</p>

<p>whole of Bengal. Four years later the daily tax method was
abandoned and a fee charged on a per weight basis, and in 1860 an
additional set of dealers' fees imposed. </p>

<p>It should be noted, however, that the system of the state of
Bengal was only one of several schemes among the many provinces.
Variations on this approach existed in the other states, a
function of the differing local administrations, reflecting the
degree of administrative and fiscal controls exerted by the
Imperial government. </p>

<p>There had apparently been controversies as to the possible
noxious effects of cannabis drugs, at least from the time of the
inception of British controls on these products, unless we assume
that the initial stated reasons for regulation were merely
cynical rationalizations for obtaining additional sources of
revenue. Within a country of several hundred millions of
inhabitants, divided into hundreds of regions, and with only
rudimentary &quot;homogenizing&quot; forces of effective
transportation and mass media, it is perhaps reasonable to infer
that wide variations in opinions and beliefs would be
encountered.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Formation of the Commission<br>
</b></p>

<p>On 2 March 1893 a question was raised in the British House of
Commons concerning the effects of the production and consumption
of hemp drugs in the province of Bengal, India. In response, the
Government of India convened a seven-member commission to look
into these questions, 3 July 1893. Upon the suggestion of Lord
Kimberley the scope of the investigation was expanded to include
all of India. </p>

<p>Procedures<br>
</p>

<p>The Commission actually met for the first time in Calcutta 3
August 1893. Between this date and 6 August of the following
year, when the study was finished, the Commission received
evidence from 1,455 witness. Field trips were made to thirty
cities in eight provinces and Burma from the end of October 1893
through the latter part of April 1894. Eighty-six meetings for
examination of witnesses transpired during the inquiry. Actual
participation of the members of the Commission was duly noted and
reported -- a custom that it might be worthwhile to revive:<br>
</p>

<p>The following statement shows the attendance of the members of
the Commission during the period occupied in inquiry (3rd August
1893 to April 1894):<br>
</p>

<p>20th September, November and from 17th to </p>

<p>49 days 25th April </p>

<p>29 days </p>

<p>The attendance of Raja Soshi Sikhareswar Roy was broken by
occasional absence caused by ill-health and other reasons. </p>

<p>The absence of Kanwar Harnam Singh during two short periods
was due to ill-health. The prolonged absence of Lala Nihal Chand
was due to the fact that he suffered from continued ill-health,
and was able to be with the Commission only at Calcutta at the
first; then for some part of their preliminary tour, and at a few
meetings for the examination of witnesses during the second tour.
All the members were present at Simla during the preparation of
the report. </p>

<p>Witnesses whose evidence was received by the Commission were
divided into three categories: </p>

<p>(1) Official witnesses able to give information regarding hemp
drugs, based on their official and local experience. </p>

<p>(2) Non-official witnesses of all ranks able to give
information regarding the drugs generally or in connection with

<p>To facilitate collection of information, seventy questions
framed by the Commission were given to witnesses. The written
answers to these questions constituted the bulk of the evidence
before the Commission. Where appropriate, witnesses were examined
orally for further clarification or explanation. In addition,
witnesses who had not submitted written statements were examined
orally. It was duly noted in the record which forms of testimony
had been provided by the individual witnesses.<br>
</p>

<p>The following excerpts discusses evidence received in
testimony and from other sources. Philosophic premises concerning
roles and responsibilities of the individual are outlined as a
prelude to discussing the practical issues of taxation, political
policy, public safety and health. In applying the principles of
English Common Law to peoples in a subcontinent whose beliefs and
customs varied greatly from those of Great Britain, the issues of
feasibility and the common good were of prime concern. If schemes
of regulation of intoxicants followed this rationalistic model
today, the mistakes made then might not require repeating in each
generation. Current technologic advances do not produce progress
in the area of human behavior; they only help to magnify defects
and frailties. <br>

<p><font size="3">Soma and the Wootton Report</font></p>

<p><font size="3">by Steve Abrams</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;In 1967 my organization Soma published a
full paged advertisement in The Times which called for reform of
the law on cannabis. Sixty-five people were persuaded to sign
this document, including leading figures in the arts and sciences
and eminent medical men. our proposals for reform stopped short
of outright legalization. However, legalization was clearly a
long term prospect if they were implemented. The advertisement
declared the existing law &quot;immoral in principle and
unworkable in practice.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The advertisement was immediately debated in
the House of Commons, where the Minister of State, Alice Bacon,
announced an expert inquiry headed by Baroness Wootton of
Abinger. In January 1969 the so-called &quot;Wootton Report&quot;
on Cannabis endorsed the position taken in the advertisement,
that &quot;the long asserted dangers of cannabis were
exaggerated, and that the related law was socially damaging, if
not unworkable.&quot;* The Home Secretary of the day, James
Callaghan (now Lord Callaghan) put up a smokescreen. He denounced
the Report, claiming its authors had been
&quot;overinfluenced&quot; by the &quot;lobby&quot; responsible
for &quot;that notorious advertisement.&quot; However, after
waiting for a year, he quietly introduced legislation to
implement the recommendations of the Wootton Report.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The legislation expired with the 1970 general
election, but it was immediately reintroduced by the Tory
government and became law as the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. The
law implemented the unanimous view of the Advisory Committee on
Drug Dependence that end users of cannabis should no longer face
the prospect of imprisonment. This was spelled out by the Lord
Chancellor, Lord Hailsham, in his advice to magistrates on
sentencing. After a prolonged debate Britain had decided to
condone the use of cannabis. Today the law is scarcely enforced
against end users, and the majority of arrests are dealt with by
the procedure of cautioning, without a conviction being
recorded.**&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">*Home Office Advisory Committee on Drug
Dependence - Report on Cannabis, 1968, p. 1</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;** &quot;The law banning cannabis sale
and use is all but unenforced.&quot; Times leader, &quot;Overdue
for Repeal&quot;, 24 July 1992&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This interpretation of the history of cannabis
law reform has been consistently denied in the media.* A full
paged article in The Independent on July 22, 1992
(&quot;Twenty-five years gone up in smoke&quot;) was summarised:
&quot;On the 24th July 1967 sixty-five of the famous liberal
great and good signed an advertisement in The Times calling for
cannabis to be legalized and ... nothing happened.&quot; Lord
Deedes, writing in The Telegraph on December 15, 1992 said the
same thing about the Wootton Report.&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">The last public debate on the subject took
    place in 1969, when Baroness Wootton, then chairman of a
    sub-committee of the Government's advisory body, recommended
    a lightening of penalties for possession of cannabis. As a
    member of the same body, I remember that I thought her
    arguments persuasive but politically unattainable. We
    discussed this amicably until Jim Callaghan, the Home
    Secretary, denounced her proposals in the House of Commons,
    and that was that.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">Lord Deedes is at least willing to admit the
existence of the Wootton Report. However, when Lady Wootton died
in 1988, at the age of 91, the work for which she was best known
was not considered worthy of mention in obituaries, notably in
The Independent and the Guardian.** The Telegraph was the only
newspaper which got it right:&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">In 1967 her Report on soft drugs caused a
    considerable furore by its recommendation of more lenient
    sentences for offences involving cannabis, and was dismissed
    patronizingly by James Callaghan as &quot;overinfluenced by a
    lobby in favour of legalizing pot.&quot; In 1970, however,
    Callaghan introduced legislation broadly in line with the
    Wootton proposals.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">The press celebrated the twentieth anniversary
of many trivial events of the 'sixties, but there does not seem
to have been a single reference in 1989 to the controversy which
dominated the news in January and February 1969. When a long
television interview with Lady Wootton was shown posthumously,
the subject of drugs was not raised, but a voice-over made the
astonishing claim that &quot;in the 'sixties she campaigned for
the legalization of cannabis.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">*The Times did, finally, print a letter from me
on 24 July 1992. It is interesting to compare this letter with
another which Rees-Mogg refused to print in February 1969. That
letter in included in my article. &quot;Cannabis Law Reform in
Britain&quot; in The Marijuana Papers by David Soloman, Penguin
Books, 1970, pp. 69-79 (UK edition only).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;** So far as I know, the Wootton Report
has never been mentioned in The Independent. The authors of the
page published on July 22, 1992, Dina Rabinovich, Emily Greene
and Andrew Brown, listed forty events following on after the
advertisement but pointedly ignored the existence of the Report
and the reduction in penalties under the Misuse of Drugs Act.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;In a letter to the Times on February 5th,
1969 in the aftermath of the Parliamentary debate on the Wootton
Report, Lady Wootton and the Chairman of the Advisory Committee,
Sir Edward Wayne, noted that none of the members of the
sub-committee supported the legalization of cannabis. On the
Sunday following publication of the Report, Lady Wootton said in
an article in The Sunday Times : &quot;Even those who wanted to
legalize (cannabis), even the people who signed the Times
advertisement, admit that immediate legalization is not
practical.&quot;*</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Wootton Report did contemplate the eventual
legalization of cannabis, but the so-called &quot;cannabis
lobby&quot; refused to jump the gun. The 1969 Prospectus of the
Soma Research Association, Ltd. said:</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">A Soma delegation gave oral evidence to the
    sub-committee. We took the view that prohibition appeared to
    be an ineffective and socially damaging method of controlling
    the misuse of cannabis. However, we argued that realistic
    decisions about the long term control and possible
    legalization of cannabis could not be made on the basis of
    existing knowledge. Additional research was required, but
    could not be undertaken because the law prohibited research
    in which cannabis was smoked.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">The advertisement said, &quot;The Government
ought to welcome and encourage research into all aspects of
cannabis smoking, but according to the law as it stands, no one
is permitted to smoke cannabis under any circumstances, and
exceptions cannot be made for scientific or medical
research.&quot; Lady Wootton made the same point in her Sunday
Times article: &quot;People have not been able to undertake
serious research because smoking is forbidden on all
premises.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Research was prohibited because it was an
offence to have charge of premises where cannabis was smoked. The
liability was absolute; guilty knowledge was not required. No
exceptions were judged possible. Cannabis could not even be
smoked by a machine on government premises. The law contained a
term which made it impossible to challenge its own premisses of
the harmfulness of cannabis smoking.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The advertisement asserted that cannabis was
&quot;the least dangerous of pleasure-giving drugs.&quot; The
argument was rehearsed at some length, and those persuaded by it
might well have been inclined to experiment. It came close to
saying that the main danger of cannabis smoking was the prospect
of being arrested. But any criticism of an unjust law is likely
to breed disrespect for the law. The text said, &quot;The
prohibition of cannabis has brought the law into disrepute and
has demoralized police officers faced with the necessity of
enforcing an unjust law.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;* Barbara Wootton, &quot;Time and the
Drug Scene,&quot; Sunday Times, 12 January 1969.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">At the 1967 Tory party conference, the Shadow
Home Secretary, Quintin Hogg (now Lord Hailsham), denounced the
organizers and signatories of the Soma advertisement. He said
that the editor of The Times, William Rees-Mogg (now Lord
Rees-Mogg), would never live down the scandal caused by its
publication. Hogg was &quot;profoundly shocked by the
irresponsibility of those who wanted to change the law. Their
arguments were &quot;casuistic, confused, sophistical and
immature:&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">There is no half-way house in this matter.
    There can be no encouraging the drug up to a point. You
    either sell it over the counter or in the shops or you
    prohibit it altogether.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">Rees-Mogg replied in a Times leader, &quot;The
Right to Dissent,&quot; on October 23rd:</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;We believe that people who want to
    change the law have a right to put their case to the public.
    We do not accept advertisements from people who want to break
    the law. But there is a vital difference between wanting the
    law to be broken and wanting it to be changed. ... Mr. Hogg
    thinks that the subject of drugs is so dangerous that free
    discussion cannot be allowed, that those who disagree with
    him have no right to be heard. Our view would be that his
    rhetorical approach is more likely to repel than to
    persuade.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">In January 1969, following publication of the
Wootton Report, Hogg wrote in the Daily Express that it was
necessary to &quot;pursue the addicts of hashish and marijuana
with the utmost severity the law allows.&quot; When the report
was debated in Parliament, on the 27th of January, Hogg insisted
that cannabis was a dangerous addictive drug, the cause of
madness and mayhem. He opposed any reduction in the maximum
penalty of ten years' imprisonment because, in this event,
&quot;the conclusion drawn by the public, by traffickers in the
drug and by potential victims of it would be that the government
were on their way to legalizing its use.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The penalties under the Dangerous Drugs Act did
not distinguish between supply and use. The maximum penalties
were one year on summary conviction and ten years on inditement.
Reducing the penalties for possession of cannabis would involve
putting down the maximum penalty on summary conviction to six
months or less. This would mean, in practice, that users of
cannabis would no longer face the prospect of imprisonment. The
main deterrent to consumption would thus be removed and use would
increase. The stigma of a criminal conviction would soon be
lessened. The police would no longer have much incentive to
enforce the law and in due course they would be unable to enforce
it. Finally, legalization would come, after a generation.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The issue of cannabis law reform was raised at
a crucial time. In 1967 the drug laws were in disarray. The
Dangerous Drugs Act applied to drugs controlled under the UN
Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, namely heroin, cocaine and
cannabis, including their derivatives and analogues. Amphetamine
and LSD were subject to more moderate penalties under the Drugs
(Prevention of Misuse) Act 1964. LSD had only just become illegal
and barbiturates were not controlled at all. Meanwhile some
cannabis users were punished more severely than heroin users.
Cannabis smoking was regarded as a crime but heroin addiction was
treated as an illness. Doctors had the right to prescribe heroin.
The Court might send a cannabis smoker to prison and send a
heroin user to a doctor.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The formation of Soma was announced in an
article published in Cherwell, the Oxford student newspaper, on
February 1st, 1967. The national press became involved in a
controversy about the prevalence of cannabis at Oxford, arising
out of an article by myself in an anthology, The Book 21 Grass,
edited by George Andrews and Simon Vinkenoog.* The publisher sold
the &quot;story&quot; to The People, who brought&nbsp;it out in
two inch headlines on January 29th. This article was quoted at
length by President Clinton's drugs adviser, Professor Norman
Grinspoon in his book, Marihuana Reconsidered (Harvard University
Press, 1971; pp. 311-312. It was also described in the Times
Literary Supplement (June 15th, 1967) as &quot;a sane and
balanced piece of writing that does much to implement the ...
view that harm rather than good is done by the existing state of
the law.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">*&nbsp;&quot;The Oxford Scene and the
Law&quot;, The Book of Grass, Peter Owen 1967, pp. 235-42</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Following a press conference on February 2nd to
launch the Book of Grass, an article by Peter Fiddick appeared in
The Guardian, prophetically entitled, &quot;Pot lobby moves into
gear.&quot; (February 3rd) Follow up articles, debating the
prevalence of cannabis smoking at Oxford, appeared The Times, The
Telegraph and the Guardian. There were also several articles in
The Oxford Mail, and the story dominated Cherwell (then edited by
Julian Norridge) for the remainder of the term.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The page one lead in Cherwell was accompanied
by a double paged spread, &quot;The Pot Plot&quot;, a kind of dry
run for the Times advertisement which served as a fact sheet for
the media. &quot;The Pot Plot&quot; was noticed by the popular
press. &quot;Smoke more pot. It's safer than beer,&quot; wrote
Arthur Smith in the Daily Mirror on January 31st. &quot;Make it
legal to take marihuana urges Oxford student&quot; was the
heading for an article in the Mail the following day by Nicholas
Lloyd (former Cherwell editor, now Sir Nicholas, editor of the
Daily Express). On the 6th of February I took part in a
television discussion with the Chief Constable of Oxford C. G.
Burroughs and a psychiatrist from the Littlemore Hospital, Dr.
O'Gorman, on the television program &quot;Today&quot;, from
Birmingham.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On the same day, The Telegraph printed the
following letter from me:&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">May I make myself clear? Drug addiction is
    extremely rare within the University of Oxford. I do not know
    of any resident member of the University who is addicted to
    narcotics such as heroin and cocaine. There are probably a
    number of addicts to amphetamines and barbiturates, drugs
    which are widely and indiscriminately prescribed under the
    National Health Service.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">There is no reason to believe that the
    widespread use of cannabis (marijuana or hashish or hemp)
    constitutes a problem at the University. Cannabis is
    nonaddictive and there have been no cases at Oxford of
    disorderly behaviour attributable to its influence. The
    consensus of informed medical opinion is that cannabis is
    probably less harmful than alcohol.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The civil authorities and the press have
    indiscriminately confused the non-addictive and relatively
    harmless herb cannabis with addictive and harmful drugs such
    as amphetamines and heroin. When challenged on this point
    they argue that cannabis is indirectly harmful because its
    use leads to heroin addiction.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">There is little or no evidence in support
    of this view. One might as well argue that sex leads to
    prostitution. The effects of cannabis and heroin are opposite
    in character. Heroin users are disturbed individuals who need
    to escape from reality; cannabis has the effect of enhancing
    reality.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">My qualified estimate that five per cent of
    Oxford students use cannabis when it is available has been
    challenged by authorities who have a strong vested interest
    in minimising the extent of the situation. Students go out of
    their way to conceal information from these authorities, but
    they go out of their way to reveal information to me.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">My estimate was based on four years direct
    observation, in the course of which I observed hundreds of
    people smoking and conducted and cross-checked many careful
    interviews. Perhaps I have sources of information which are
    unavailable to the Chief Constable, the proctors and various
    anonymous university officials.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">*&nbsp;According to press reports, &quot;money
changed hands for The People article.&quot; Cf. &quot;Our Man in
Fleet Street&quot;, Drugs and Society, vol. 1, no. 3 (December
1971, pp. 34-35) and the response, a letter from me, in vol. 1,
no. 4, January 1972, p. 37 I was not paid. I had no contract with
the publisher, who sold the story without my permission and
against my protests, which are documented.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I had been playing the numbers game. Five per
cent of junior members of the university translates to five
hundred Oxford students. I felt no compunction about using the
image of the University to challenge the traditional stereotype
of the anti-social drug taker. Following publication of the
People lead, an article in The Times said that my claim that
&quot;at least 500 undergraduates and a few dozen dons&quot;
smoke pot &quot;has been rejected by police, proctors and
dons.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Times quoted the view of the Senior
Proctor, Dr. Robin Fletcher, that my figures were &quot;grossly
exaggerated.&quot; : &quot;The article could create a very bad
image of the University. It is unfortunate for a number of
reasons.&quot; A similar article in The Telegraph quoted the view
of &quot;a senior member of the university who is concerned with
investigations into student health problems&quot; : &quot;I would
be surprised if the number of people using drugs habitually in
the University is more than about twenty.&quot; This official was
presumably D. C. M. Yardley, (now Local Ombudsman) who was Dr.
Fletcher's predecessor. The Telegraph stated that Dr. Yardley had
led an investigation of undergraduate drug use the preceding year
and concluded that no more than fifty students were involved. No
more than thirty took drugs with any degree of regularity. In the
Cherwell lead on February 1st, Dr. Yardley's view of the danger
of cannabis is quoted: &quot;The nervous system of regular pot
smokers is shot to bits. They are mental wrecks.&quot; In The
People he is quoted: &quot;All but those with the strongest minds
will end up seeking bigger and better 'kicks' from heroin and
like drugs. Within the university and nationally, any move to
bring about the acceptance of hemp must be fought.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The matter was resolved by the University
Committee on Student Health, which included several heads of
colleges. I was invited to give evidence to the Committee on
February 15th. They accepted my claim that as many as five
hundred undergraduates had used cannabis. I made the point that
the problem was hardly confined to Oxford and asked the Committee
to press the Home Secretary to institute a government inquiry
into the status of cannabis and LSD. The Chairman of the
Committee was the Head of my college, St. Catherine's, Alan
Bullock (now Lord Bullock, formerly Vice Chancellor of the
University). He told me that my suggestion that the University
press for a Home Office inquiry had been accepted and invited me
to assist him in drafting the letter to this effect, which was
sent to the then Vice Chancellor, Kenenth Turpin on February
28th.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The first account of the Student Health Report
appeared in a Cherwell exclusive on the 1st of March. On the same
day things looked as if they might be getting out of hand.
Cherwell had announced a &quot;happening&quot; in Wellington
Square, sponsored by International Times. It was to be filmed for
German television. John Hopkins, the organizer, promised to
provide Suzie Creamcheese of the &quot;Mothers of Invention&quot;
pop group on a white horse. The front page of the Oxford Mail for
March 2nd has a photo of hundreds of students pouring out of
Balliol College and another of them marching along the High.
There were signs and banners with legends such as &quot;Death
penalty for pot&quot; and &quot;God moves in a mysterious
way.&quot; The Deputy Chief Constable stated that &quot;more than
500 students disorganized the city centre for over two
hours.&quot;*&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Oxford Mail account says that the police
tried to clear Wellington Square, whereupon the
&quot;happening&quot; reformed as a procession down St. John's
Street. They moved straight across Beaumont Street and St. Giles,
without pausing for traffic, in through Balliol College back
entrance (where the police could not follow) and out again
through the front entrance in Broad Street. The procession
continued on through the Turl and the High to Carfax. The
&quot;happening&quot; was also covered in the national press. The
Sun called attention to six undergraduates tied together with a
plastic rope crawling along the High Street, insisting they were
climbing a mountain. The Sun also remarked on the presence of a
girl on horseback carrying a sign which said, &quot;Free Suzie
Creamcheese!&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Report of the Committee on Student Health
was published on April 3rd and reviewed in The Times the
following day. The Times article says, &quot;At the Health
Committee's suggestion, the Vice Chancellor of Oxford University,
Mr. K. C. Turpin, is to ask the Home Secretary for an urgent
national enquiry into the dangers of drug taking.&quot; It said
the university was concerned at the numbers which might be
experimenting with cannabis. The following article by Nicholas
Lloyd appeared in the Daily Mail:&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">The pot takers. 500 Oxford students use
    marijuana&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">About 500 Oxford undergraduates smoke
    marijuana,, says a committee of dons. The Committee was set
    up to report on the health of students at the university. In
    a letter to Kenneth Turpin, the Vice Chancellor, it say that
    an independent claim that about five per cent of the 10,000
    students take drugs is probably correct.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">But it maintains that the situation at
    Oxford is not exceptional and that a similar proportion of
    students at other universities take drugs. The committee,
    headed by Mr. Alan Bullock, Master of St. Catherine's
    College, says that drug taking is a national problem. It
    calls for a full investigation into the effects of different
    drugs and says that public policy could then be based on
    scientific fact instead of prejudice.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">On Tuesday students at St. Catherine's
    College passed a motion by 24 votes to 4 in favour of making
    marijuana - known as 'pot' - legally available.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;* In fact the numbers were swelled
because students from the Oxford Polytechnic, in their &quot;rag
week&quot;, joined the proceedings.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On the 7th of April, the Home secretary, Roy
Jenkins, announced the appointment of an investigation led by
Baroness Wootton. She was to head a &quot;sub-committee on
hallucinogens&quot; of the Advisory Council on Drug Dependence,
appointed in December 1966, enacting a recommendation of the
Second Brain Report the previous year.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">We hoped for something earth shaking from the
Wootton Committee. We hoped for a published report on cannabis
that would bear comparison with the New York Mayor's Report on
Marihuana (the La Guardia Report) of 1944 and the East Indian
Hemp Drugs Report of 1893-94. The first stage of the campaign had
been concluded.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The chain of events leading to the appearance
of the advertisement involved an interaction with the affairs of
the Rolling Stones, the Beatles and the so-called
&quot;underground.&quot; One of the reasons for raising the
subject of cannabis with urgency in the favourable context of its
use at Oxford was the need to combat what a Times leader (&quot;A
Dangerous Press Camapign&quot;) soon called &quot;the deliberate
sensationalism that underlines the present campaign against
&quot;drugs.&quot; The Soma advertisement said &quot;The crime at
issue is not drug abuse but heresy.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Traditionally, the use of cannabis had been
largely confined to Blacks, Indians and Arabs.* Muslims broadly
tolerated the use of cannabis but prohibited alcohol, which is,
literally, sacred to Christians, and also to Jews. The new rock
music could be represented as a fusion of black rhythms and
Eastern spirituality. The gentle undulations of the music were
also explicitly sexual. For decades the Americans, in particular,
had portrayed the use of cannabis as degenerate.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The News of the World replied to the article in
the People by accusing the Rolling Stones of abusing drugs.
(February 3rd) The same night Mick Jagger appeared with Hogg on
the Eamon Andrews talk show. Jagger told Hogg that he too had
been to university, and seemed to get he better of him. Then, I
thought, he got above himself and announced, impulsively, that he
would sue the News of the World for libel. The newspaper panicked
and went to the Scotland Yard Drug Squad. The head of the Drug
Squad, Chief Inspector Lynch later told me that he refused to
act. He said that he was not expected to stamp out cannabis, but
to keep its use under control. If he arrested Mick Jagger every
lad in the country would want to try some pot. He was, after all,
head of the drug squad, not head of the Lynch mob.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">* The statistics published with the Wootton
Report show that 1964, the first year in which white offenders
outnumbered blacks, was also the first year in which a minority
(48 per cent) of cannabis offenders were sent to prison.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">As is well known, the News of the World had
more success with the local police in West Wittering, where Keith
Richards lived. In the subsequent trial, Jagger's counsel,
Michael Havers (later Lord Havers, also Mrs. Thatcher's attorney
general in the &quot;Spycatcher&quot; case) alleged that the
newspaper used an agent provocateur. The arrests were made on
February 12th, but the story did not break until the 19th. Only
the Telegraph named those arrested, Keith Richards, charged with
the absolute offence of permitting premises to be used for
smoking cannabis, and Mick Jagger, charged with possession of
amphetamine. George Harrison has said that the Beatles were at
the party that was raided, but the police waited until they
left.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Perhaps the beginning of the entire sequence of
events was the arrest on cannabis charges on December 30th 1966
of the aforementioned John Hopkins (Hoppy), a member of the
editorial board of the underground newspaper &quot;International
Times.&quot;* The &quot;underground&quot; was a literary and
artistic avant garde with a large contingent from Oxford and
Cambridge. Hoppy, for example, was trained as a physicist at
Cambridge. The underground had found an enemy in Lord Goodman,
Chairman of the Arts Council, who went over the head of the Home
Secretary, Roy Jenkins, and appealed directly to the Director of
Public Prosecutions to mount a police raid on the Indica bookshop
where International Times was edited.** Goodman had an animus
against (Barry) Miles, co-proprietor of the bookshop with Peter
Asher, and also a member of the Editorial Board of IT. In
December 1966 Eric Whitte nominated Miles to serve on the Arts
Council Literary Advisory Panel. Goodman had been infuriated when
his appointment was announced to the press on January 30th, and
had him thrown off.***&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Hoppy, who was on bail, organized the greatest
of the underground events, the &quot;24 Hour Technicolour
Dream&quot; at Alexandra Palace on April 29th, to raise funds for
the defence of the paper. When his trial came up, he insisted on
pleading not guilty though he had no defence. He had a previous
conviction for possession of cannabis but insisted on a jury
trial, which meant going before a judge of the Crown Court and
risking a longer sentence than one year. Hoppy completed a
classical recipe for self-imprisonment by lecturing the court on
the need to legalize cannabis. Sentencing him to nine months
imprisonment on June 1st, the Deputy Chairman of Inner London
Sessions, A. Gordon Friend, said:&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">I have just heard what your views are on
    the possession of cannabis and the smoking of it. This is not
    a matter I can overlook - You are a pest to society.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">* Lord Thompson, proprietor of The Times,
obtained an injunction to stop the use of the word
&quot;Times&quot; in the title. The paper then became
&quot;IT&quot; until Max Handley restored its correct name in the
mid seventies. Incidently the girl in the logo is not Clara Bow.
Its Theda Bara.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;** According to Tom Driberg.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">*** Peter Fryer - &quot;A Map of the
Underground&quot;, Encounter, October 1967, pp. 9-10</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;A sympathetic account of the case
was published by Clive Goodwin in Tribune and Christopher Logue
contributed a poem &quot;For John Hopkins, imprisoned in
Wandsworth Jail&quot;, which appeared in the New Statesman on
July 7th.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The next day, June 2nd, Hoppy's friends met at
Indica. I raised my idea of advertising in The Times.* Miles said
he thought he knew where the money might be found. He had been to
school with his partner, Peter Asher, who was half of the pop duo
&quot;Peter and Gordon&quot;, a &quot;one-hit wonder.&quot; Peter
Asher's sister, Jane, was Paul McCartney's girlfriend. McCartney
had several times contributed small sums to keep IT going. By the
end of the day he had offered to guarantee the cost of the
advertisement, which was #1800.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I was not as surprised as I might have been at
this turn of events. I had gone to the meeting thinking about the
plight of the Beatles and their record company, EMI. &quot;Sgt
Pepper&quot; had been officially released the preceding day. I
had purchased a copy from the HMV Shop in Notting Hill on the
27th of May and had been listening to it continuously. Earlier in
the year the single Strawberry Fields/Penny Lane suggested that
the Beatles had become enthusiastic proponents of LSD. &quot;Sgt
Pepper&quot; reinforced this impression. McCartney had also given
an ill-advised interview to Life magazine. The Beatles had
&quot;pissed&quot; on their clean image as explicitly as the
Rolling Stones had &quot;pissed&quot; on a garage forecourt in
June 1965.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The establishment was ready to send the Rolling
Stones to prison. Now it looked as if the Beatles would be next.
Something had to be done to get them off the hook. Nobody wanted
them arrested, but it was difficult to see an alternative. I
proposed, in effect, to change the issue from LSD to pot and to
associate the Beatles with leading figures in the arts and
sciences in a legitimate protest from 'within the system.' It is
not in any way surprising that McCartney was willing to back the
advertisement or that Rees-Mogg was willing to publish it.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;I went along with Miles to discuss the
project with McCartney. Unless my memory is playing tricks on me,
McCartney thrust a copy of Sergent Pepper into my hands and said,
&quot;Listen to it through headphones on acid.&quot; The
conversation that followed was, however, sedate. McCartney was
well aware of the power of public statements coming from the
Beatles. He realized that if they spoke out on too many issues,
their influence would be diluted. But pot was going to be an
exception. McCartney said that the Beatles and their manager
Brian Epstein would all put their names to the advertisement and
he agreed that the project would be left entirely in my hands. He
hoped that his participation in the funding could be kept quiet.
It came to the attention of the Evening Standard the next day. I
received a call from the Diary, from Max Hastings or Julian
Norridge translated from Cherwell. &quot;How could you possibly
know?&quot; I asked. The source, I was immediately told, was the
editor, Charles Wintour.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Later I spoke to McCartney on the phone. We
agreed that Phillip Oates could say in his first
&quot;Atticus&quot; in the Sunday Times (eventually published on
July 9th) that all four Beatles would be among those contributing
to the cost of the advertisement. Then, on the eve of
publication, when I attended The Times to inspect the proofs, the
advertising manager, R. Grant Davidson, got cold feet.
Publication had been delayed for a week whilst he checked all the
names. Now he asked for payment in advance. I rang the only
person I had met in the Beatles organization, Peter Brown of the
music publishing company, Northern Music (NEMS). He sent round
his personal cheque for #1800. Someone later told me that he had
been reimbursed from a Beatles advertising account. Probably none
of the Beatles was out of pocket.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">As the advertising manager's caution indicates,
the publication of the advertisement was a near thing. The
deciding factor in persuading the Times to publish and the
Beatles to meet the cost was probably the sensational case of the
Rolling Stones, which began on the 27th of June. The verdicts
came on Thursday the 30th. Richards was sentenced to a year in
prison on the premises charge and Jagger was given three months
for possession of four amphetamine tablets known as 'black
bombers.' Both were first offenders. They were released on bail
the following day.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">That night there was a spontaneous
demonstration outside the News of the World building in Fleet
street. No one had cared enough to demonstrate in Fleet Street
since the first world war, and no one would ever care enough to
do so again. The police turned dogs on the demonstrators and six
people were arrested. The demonstrations continued into the early
hours of the morning. The next day, Richards and Jagger were
released on bail. It being Friday, the members of the underground
club, UFO, over a thousand persons in extravagant dress, marched
at midnight from Tottenham, Court Road to the statue of Eros at
Piccadilly Circus, where they were joined by several hundred
members of other West End clubs. I remember Pat Arrowsmith of CND
wringing her hands in anguish, being quite unable to comprehend
our tactics.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">We then formed up and marched to Fleet Street.
Again the police turned dogs against us, and one demonstrator was
bitten. On Saturday the News of the World demonstrations
continued for the third night running. A picture of part of the
crowd, myself among them, appeared on the front page of the News
of the World. Mick Farren, a future editor of IT and lead singer
of the Social Deviants, was beaten by the police and a number of
others were arrested, including Suzie Creamcheese.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Rees-Mogg's celebrated leading article,
&quot;Who breaks a butterfly on a wheel?&quot; appeared in The
Times on the same day, Saturday the 1st of July. My admiration
for it is subject to qualification. The editor did not address
the issue squarely. He was moved by the spectacle of Jagger in
handcuffs, but said nothing at all about the twelve months
sentence meted out to Keith Richards, who was convicted of being
in control of premises used for the purpose of cannabis smoking.
The leader did not question the justice of this charge, which was
an &quot;absolute&quot; offence that did not require guilty
knowledge on the part of the offender. Rees-Mogg did not mention
cannabis at all.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The last &quot;event&quot; preceding
publication of the Times advertisement was the famous
&quot;Legalize Pot Rally&quot; at Speakers Corner in Hyde Park on
Sunday the 16th of July. This was one of a series of
&quot;be-ins&quot; which had been taking place at monthly
intervals at Primrose Hill and Hampstead Heath. &quot;Vast
publicity for legalize pot rally. Steve Abrams appears on
television with amazing regularity,&quot; wrote International
Times. In the event, several thousand people turned up, many
wearing flowers and bells and many smoking pot openly. Most of
the national newspapers gave &quot;flower power&quot; a double
paged spread the next day.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I presided at the meeting and introduced Alan
Ginsberg. When a policeman asked him to stop playing his
harmonium, which went against the by-laws, he was filmed giving
the policeman a flower. I decided to break up the meeting into
small groups. I remember Stokely Carmichael, Alexis Korner,
Carolyn Coon, Spike Hawkins, Clive Goodwin and Adrian Mitchell
speaking simultaneously, each mounted on a soap-box and
surrounded by a few hundred people. I was surprised to findmy
remarks used in a schools program on &quot;The Right to
Protest&quot; that seemed to be repeated on television most
afternoons. Everyone had a good time in Hyde Park. No one was
arrested. We had struck another blow against the image of the
unkempt and violent drug addict. &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The aim of the advertisement was to influence
the Wootton subcommittee on hallucinogens. They had restricted
themselves to pharmacological and medical studies on both
cannabis and LSD. We wanted them to report on cannabis alone, to
emphasize the social aspect of its use and to make specific
recommendations for law reform.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Crude attempts were made to discredit the
professional competence of the sub-committee. Following
publication of the Report on Cannabis, Quintin Hogg was quoted in
The Times, on January 9th, 1969: &quot;A less suitable committee
is impossible to imagine. Half the subcommittee are doctors and
there is not a judge, or anybody practising at the criminal bar,
among them.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The eleven members of the sub-committee were K.
J. Barraclough, a stipendiary magistrate and Chairman of the
Poisons Board; Dr. Thomas Bewley, a psychiatrist in charge of the
addiction clinic at Tooting Bec Hospital, the Secretary and later
President of the Society for the Study of Addiction; Peter
Brodie, Assistant Commissioner of Scotland Yard in charge of the
C.I.D., also Vice President of Interpol; Dr. P. H. Connell, a
psychiatrist at the Maudsley Hospital; Dr. J. D. P. Graham,
professor of pharmacology; Dr. C. R. B. Joyce, Head of the
Department of Pharmacology at London Hospital Medical College,
later Director of Research at Ciba, Switzerland; Sir Aubrey
Lewis, Emeritus Professor of Psychiatry at the Maudsley; Dr.
Nicholas Malleson, a psychiatrist, Reader in Student Problems and
Head of Student Health at London University, also the most
experienced LSD therapist in Britain; H. W. Palmer of the Glaxo
Pharmaceuticals Company; Timothy Raison, Editor of New Society,
later Tory MP, Minister of State for Home Affairs; Michael
Schofield, a sociologist who had conducted several studies for
the Home Office; and Baroness Wootton, a distinguished social
scientist, a serving magistrate, Governor of the BBC, veteran of
several Royal Commissions.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I decided that Dr. Malleson was the key member
of the subcommittee. Had it been a jury, he would probably have
been the foreman. I approached him and offered to rewrite the
text of the advertisemnt until it satisfied him. In return, I
asked to use his name privately in soliciting signatures. I had
met Michael Schofield as a fellow member of the committee
preparing a Report on Drugs and Civil Liberties for the National
Council on Civil Liberties (NCCL). I asked him to sign the
advertisement.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The sub-committee met 17 times between April
1967 and July 1968. At the first meeting the plan was to report
to the main committee in October. The report was to be restricted
in scope and to treat both cannabis and LSD. Before the
advertisement appeared, the committee limited its enquiries to
pharmacological and medical questions.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">According to Michael Schofield, the
sub-committee were not favourably disposed to begin with. At the
first meeting one member said that research was not necessary and
that all the sub-committee had to do was to work out ways to
&quot;stop the spread of this filthy habit.&quot; During the
early meetings, six members wanted to take a hard line, four were
undecided and two felt that the penalties for possession were too
severe.* The two liberals were probably Schofield and Malleson.
It follows that Lady Wootton took some persuading.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">If there was a consensus of informed medical
opinion on cannabis, the sub-committee would have to recognize
it. The important thing was to do what could be done to persuade
them to report on cannabis alone and to broaden the scope of
their enquiry, to give proper consideration to the social aspects
of cannabis use and to make specific recommendations for law
reform. My endeavour in the text of the advertisement was to
define the issues for a public debate.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The debate began immediately. The advertisement
was mentioned in Parliament on the day of its appearance. Four
days later, the headlines were about the savage sentence of five
years' imprisonment and a 10,000 fine or an extra year which
Judge Argyle passed on a black man charged with
&quot;possession&quot; of cannabis. He did this, he said to
express his disapproval of the Soma advertisement.** He also
claimed that 69 of 70 heroin addicts in Birmingham had
&quot;started on cannabis.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On the same day, Friday the 28th, the Soma
advertisement was the subject of an adjournment debate in the
House of Commons proposed by Paul Channon. The Minister of State,
Alice Bacon (Later Baroness Bacon), claimed that 97 per cent of
heroin addicts known to the Home Office had &quot;started on
cannabis.&quot; She seems to have invented this figure. Her
speech was racist in tone and credited cannabis and LSD with the
importation of negro music and Indian spirituality. She compared
McCartney unfavourably with a now forgotten singer called
&quot;Lulu.&quot; However, she said that the issues raised in the
advertisement would be considered by the Wootton sub-committee,
and she committed the Government to taking their Report into
consideration in framing new legislation.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">* Michael Schofield - The Strange Case of Pot,
Pelican Books, 1971. Schofield has a chapter about
&quot;Reactions to the Wootton Report&quot; but he ignores
Callaghan's assertion that the sub-committee had been
&quot;overinfluenced&quot; by the &quot;lobby&quot; responsible
for the Soma advertisement. He also fails to mention the fact
that he was a signatory to the advertisement.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">** The man was regarded by the Court as a major
supplier. Press reports did not specify the quantity of cannabis
found in his possession. The sentence was reduced on
appeal.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In this debate William Deedes outdid himself.
He was under the illusion that hashish is far more dangerous than
marijuana.&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">Does anyone believe that if we were to end
    the black market in cannabis leaf by legalizing it, a black
    market in resin would not begin. That could undermine the
    nation. That is why I believe that those who sign public
    announcements assume very grave responsibilities unless they
    can back what they say with more knowledge than most of
    us,believe we have.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">Tom Driberg, who signed the Soma advertisement,
read from his father's evidence to the East Indian Hemp Drugs
Commission in 1892. I briefed Driberg and Channon and got to sit
in the strangers box on the floor of the house during the debate.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On Monday the 31st of July, a week following
the publication of the advertisement, the conviction of Keith
Richards was quashed and Jagger's prison sentence (for possession
of amphetamine tablets) was reduced to a conditional discharge.
The Soma advertisement had asked for the abolition of the
premises offence and included a plea for the release of all those
imprisoned for possession of cannabis.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Soma was an informal organization when the
advertisement appeared. Later, it was incorporated as the Soma
Research Association, Ltd. There was a very distinguished Board
of Directors, including the most eminent living scientist,
Francis Crick, F.R.S., who won a Nobel prize for his discovery
with James Watson of the structure of DNA. The Board included
four psychiatrists: Professor Norman Zinberg of Harvard, whose
experiment published in 1968 was the first authorised by the US
government and became the strongest affirmation of the relatively
harmless character of cannabis smoking; Dr. Anthony Storr, a
leading establishment figure and author; Dr. R. D. Laing, the
leading radical analyst of the day; and his colleague at the
Philadelphia Association, Dr. David Cooper. The other directors
were The Revd. Kenneth Leech, the leading authority on drug abuse
within the Church of England, an early advocate of the
&quot;legalization&quot; of cannabis; Francis Huxley, the Oxford
anthropologist, and myself. Cooper, Crick, Huxley, Laing and
Storr were signatories to the advertisement.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Soma had five employees, including Don Aitken,
the Secretary and Archivist; Derek Blackburn, Psychologist; and
Adam Parker-Rhodes, Pharmacologist. Premises were at 438, Fulham
Road, SW6 and 4, Camden High Street, NW1. Soma had active
research and medical programs, the latter in collaboration with
the doctors at an affiliated NHS surgery in Notting Hill. Dr. Ian
Dunbar was Medical Director of Soma and Dr. Sam Hutt was Medical
Correspondent. Aitken and Blackburn prepared a bibliography of
cannabis. We did the first human experiments with the active
principle of cannabis, tetrahydracannabinol (THC), synthesized in
our laboratory. We compared the action of the isomers of THC and
tried to distinguish euphoria from intoxication by measuring the
apparent tridimensionality of visual perception, the extent to
which the world appeared, as it were,
&quot;spaced-out.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">We could work with THC because its structure
had not been determined when the Dangerous Drugs Act was last
revised. It had not been placed under UN control. Before we made
THC, we obtained supplies of a purified form of cannabis, the
alcoholic extract, which was made available on prescription.
Extracts and tinctures of cannabis had been removed from the
Pharmacopoeia but were still listed in the
Extrapharmacopoeia.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Dr. Dunbar wrote a prescription for me on the
18th of August 1967. I finally encashed it at an obscure branch
of Boots in the East End. The prescription came with a letter
that said: &quot;This is an historical document. I suggest you
frame it.&quot; Later a pop group, the Aynesley Dunbar
Retaliation brought out a famous LP called &quot;Dr. Dunbar's
Prescription.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I put it to the Home Office Drugs Branch that
most of the distinguished signatories to the advertisement and
many of those who commented on it had openly declared their use
of cannabis. For example, the following paragraph ended a letter
to The Guardian published on July 8th and shown on television in
&quot;What the Papers Say&quot; :&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">... If anyone remains unconvinced by this
    mass of expert advice then I can only offer them the evidence
    of my own experience having smoked marijuana for many years
    without ill effects whatsoever.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p><font size="3">Yours faithfully</font></p>
                <p><font size="3">Clive Goodwin</font></p>
                <p><font size="3">79 Cromwell Road</font></p>
                <p><font size="3">London SW7</font></p>
            </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;The Home Office obtained a legal opinion
that the part of the law which made it an absolute offence to
keep premises for the purposes of cannabis smoking did not apply
to the smoking of purified cannabis; that is to say, smoking
preparations based on &quot;extract of cannabis,&quot; BPC. An
approach was then made to the UN drugs control apparatus, who
increased the nominal UK quota of cannabis imports from 15 kilos
per annum to 254 kilos. (Five hundredweight) Ganja was imported
from India and made up by the botanical firm, Ransoms of Hitchen.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">One of the early debates was a seventy minute
television special on September 1st, 1967, a mock trial in the
series &quot;Your Witness&quot; in which Sir John Foster, Q.C.
was to argue the case for cannabis against Leon Brittan. Sir John
dropped out and was replaced by Jonathan Aitken, a signatory to
the advertisement (now a minister in the Government).* Aitken
proposed to call me as a witness. I had in mind smoking pot as I
gave evidence and presented myself for cross examination. The BBC
researcher, Esther Rantzen, agreed that this would be good
television, and so I approached Dr. Dunbar for the first
prescription.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">* Sir John was at a meeting at the House of
Commons in June at which he, Jonathan Aitken, Humphry Berkeley,
Tom Driberg and Brian Walden all agreed to sign the
advertisement. He later atoned for withdrawing from the
advertisement and the debate by joining Soma. Indeed, he sent
along his friend Princess Feuzy, who was a subject in our
research program.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;Leon Brittan was fully aware that
extracts and tinctures were controlled separately from cannabis
and cannabis resin and that the prohibition on the use of
premises for smoking cannabis did not apply to these purified
forms. However, he was also aware that my live appearance would
undermine his case. He therefore fudged the issue and insisted
that if I appeared the BBC would be liable to prosecution. It was
compromise in the end. I was not permitted to appear live, but
the BBC filmed me smoking at home, passing any risk onto my
landlord. The corporation thus obtained some stock film that was
reused a number of times.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On the 10th of October, 1967 Jonathan Aitken
and I successfully argued a cannabis law reform motion against
Professor Francis Camps and Robert Pitman at the London Hospital
Medical College. The next day The Telegraph reported the warning
that Professor Camps had given about the alleged dangers of
cannabis, without noting the fact that his opinion had been
rejected by a large audience of doctors and medical students.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I came up against Professor Camps again at a
conference on drugs of the Student Humanist Federation at
Nottingham University on January 5th to 7th, 1968. The problem
was to get in the way of the newspapers reporting his remarks. My
solution was to announce at the beginning of my talk that I would
be speaking under the influence of a prescribed form of cannabis.
The Times, The Telegraph and The Guardian reported this event as
if it had been a high wire act.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On the 21st of November 1967, I had spoken
against Leon Brittan at a Teach In at Guys Hospital. I did not
like his arrogance or his willingness to pontificate on a subject
of which he knew nothing. Fate was kind to me. After the
publication of the Wootton Report in 1969, I had a unique
opportunity to flatten him. We debated the Report at Bristol
University. Leon Brittan recalled the &quot;Your Witness&quot;
television program. He told the Bristol Union I had insisted on
being filmed at home because I knew I could not speak in public
under the influence of cannabis. I rose to my feet, Leon Brittan
gave way. I turned to the president of the Union, and being
advised that smoking was permitted, I resumed my seat, removed an
enormous joint from my pocket and lit up. I went through an
elaborate pantomime to distract the audience during his speech. I
pretended to be &quot;zonked.&quot; Then it was my turn to speak.
I was in my best form, and I think the Union voted unanimously
for the motion. Afterward, Brittan refused to believe I had been
smoking. He said I had pretended to inhale.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Inevitably, the debate that gave me the
greatest satisfaction was at the Oxford Union on October 19th,
1967. In my article in &quot;The Book of Grass&quot; I had said
that the one place in Oxford where cannabis was not smoked was
the Union society. Now, just months later, the Union voted in
favour of changing the law. Dr. Laing and I were opposed by Ann
Mallalieu and the Revd. John McNicoll. William Paton, the
Professor of Pharmacology, spoke against cannabis from the floor,
Earlier in the evening a motion of censure was passed against the
Proctors, who had suspended Cherwell because of its coverage of
drugs. Dr. Yardley spoke from the floor in this debate. He and I
had threshed out this matter on the television program &quot;24
Hours&quot; on the 11th.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">During the Thatcher period, every attempt was
made to blame the permissive society&quot; of the 1960s on the
political left. In fact, the left was left out, at least in 1967.
Cannabis was a libertarian issue which became very popular with
the Young Conservatives. When I spoke at a teach-in organized by
the Young Communists League, I faced a hostile audience for the
first time. Speaker after speaker rose to say that cannabis was a
capitalist plot. I was &quot;intent on distracting&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">the workers from their revolutionary
duties.&quot; John McNicoll, who also spoke in this debate, had
accused me, in the Evening Standard diary, of being a
crypto-communist. He said I had taken up drugs when lecturing at
Leningrad University. Now, with a delicious political instinct,
he accused me of being an American. In a long interview with
Penthouse magazine, published in December 1968, I said that
though Tariq Ali and Clive Goodman had signed the Soma
advertisement, &quot;We want nothing to do with their
revolution.&quot; I added: &quot;You can't smoke
Marxism.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I think the decisive event in the debate about
cannabis may have been a meeting of the Society for the Study of
Addiction at the premises of the British Medical Association on
November 7th 1967. The press were barred from this meeting, which
was attended by officials from the Home Office, senior police
officers, most of the Advisory Committee and many of the leading
medical authorities. Dr. Storr and I spoke on behalf of Soma. We
were opposed by Dr. Cedric Wilson of Liverpool University, who
made a great fool of himself by including gangrene among the
symptoms of chronic abuse of cannabis. He also repeated the claim
made by William Deedes in the House of Commons on 28 July, that
there were seven million hashish addicts in Egypt and that the
Government there was at its wits end to know what to do about it.
I quoted an article published the preceding year in the U.N.
Bulletin on Narcotics, a study sponsored by the Egyptian
government, which said there were 180,000 &quot;habitues&quot; of
cannabis in Egypt and that a study of matched groups of users and
non-users did not reveal any significant differences between the
groups.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The discussion from the floor was the important
part of the meeting. One expert after another rose to affirm the
innocuous status of cannabis. They seemed to vie with one another
in devising new arguments. It may not have reached the height of
a religious revival, but I was left with the feeling that a
consensus had been realized, that the Djinn was well out of the
bottle.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In November 1967 the reforming Home Secretary,
Roy Jenkins, exchanged places with James Callaghan, the disgraced
Chancellor of the Exchequer, who had devalued the pound. In
opposition, Callaghan had been the paid Parliamentary lobbyist
for the police federation. He was &quot;Sunny Jim, the
policeman's friend.&quot; His agenda was not that of the Labour
party; indeed, it is difficult to find a more destructive
influence in the history of that party. Through his opposition to
vital trade union reforms, his failure at the Treasury and his
pointing up what he called the &quot;permissive society&quot; as
the legacy of his predecessor at the Home Office, he probably
cost Labour the 1970 general election. Later his incompetence as
prime minister cost Labour the 1979 election, and in 1983 and
1987 he intervened against his own party because of his
opposition to nuclear disarmament.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Jenkins defended the non-partisan social
reforms of the decade and insisted that Britain was a
&quot;civilized society,&quot; rather than a permissive one.* I
recall taking part in a Third Program discussion of perhaps
unprecedented length (from 8:45 pm until past midnight)
on&nbsp;November 9th, 1969, in which Warden Sparrow of All Souls,
Michael Foot, Professor Alasdair MacIntyre (a signatory to the
advertisement) and I discussed the question, &quot;Is Britain
Civilized.&quot; Bernard Levin was in the Chair. I am now
inclined to the view that Britain has over the past quarter
century become intolerant of dissent and especially of
dissenters, that it has many and various means of denying them
the &quot;oxygen of publicity&quot;, so that the question might
seem to be not whether Britain is a &quot;civilized&quot;
society, but whether, as a prime minister seemed to imply, it
aspires to be a &quot;society&quot; at all.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">* Transport House distributed the text of
Jenkins' remarks to the Abingdon Constituency Labour Party on
July 19th, 1969 </font></p>

<p><font size="3">At the Home Office, Callaghan was intent on
salvaging his popular reputation, and happy to take the low road.
He made known his opposition to the Wootton Report. He made a
number of public interventions which could be interpreted as
attempts to sabotage the Report, or to dictate terms to the
Committee. He was not obliged to publish the Report, formally
submitted to him on November 1st, 1968 and he must have realized
that the publication of an expert report which exonerated
cannabis would do everything to undermine the existing
legislation, since it virtually said that the only reason to
refrain from smoking cannabis was the fact that it remained,
&quot;for the time being,&quot; illegal. There were reports in
the papers that some members of the Committee were prepared to
resign if the Report was not published. I was myself
contemplating a pirated edition of the Report.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Printed copies of the Wootton Report were
delivered before Christmas and distributed on January 7th, 1969.
The press were advised that Callaghan intended to denounce the
findings and recommendations of the Report.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Wootton Report went further than the Soma
advertisement in affirming the relative harmlessness of cannabis.
An often quoted summary (paragraph 29) allied the conclusions of
the Wootton Report with those of the great reports of 1893 and
1944:&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">Having reviewed all the material available
    to us we find ourselves in agreement with the conclusions
    reached by the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission appointed by the
    Government of India (1893-4) and the New York Mayor's
    Committee on Marihuana (1944) that &quot;the long term
    consumption of cannabis in moderate doses has no harmful
    effects.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">Paragraph 67, introducing the Section on
General Conclusion and Recommendations states:</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;The evidence before us shows that:</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">An increasing number of people, mainly
    young, in all classes of society are experimenting with this
    drug, and substantial numbers use it regularly for social
    pleasure.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">There is no evidence that this activity is
    causing violent crime or aggressive anti-social behaviour, or
    is producing in otherwise normal people conditions of
    dependence or psychosis, requiring medical treatment.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The experience of many other countries is
    that once it is established cannabis-smoking tends to spread.
    In some parts of Western society where interest in
    mood-altering drugs is growing, there are indications that it
    may become a functional equivalent of alcohol.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;In spite of the threat of severe
    penalties and considerable effort at enforcement the use of
    cannabis in the United Kingdom does not appear to be
    diminishing. There is a body of opinion that criticises the
    present legislative treatment of cannabis on the ground that
    it exaggerates the dangers of the drug and needlessly
    interferes with civil liberty.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">The Committee proposed that new legislation be
drafted that would distinguish between hard and soft drugs and
between drug trafficking and drug taking. It proposed that the
penalties for cannabis be reduced to the point where minor
offences would not merit imprisonment. The key recommendation was
to reduce the maximum penalty on summary conviction for
possession to four months imprisonment. The committee also
proposed to abolish absolute offences (i.e., the liability in
respect to the use of premises) and called for a legal framework
for cannabis research and medical treatment using cannabis and
its variants.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Government's expert advisors had confirmed
the apparently surreal assertions of the cannabis lobby. This
completely knocked the pins from under any attempt to enforce or
justify the law. It discharged the burden of proof that the
&quot;cannabis lobby&quot; had assumed. Whatever was said against
us could also be said against the Advisory Council and against
Callaghan, who had not been bound to publish the Report. The
terms of the debate were now changed. If the Government wanted to
send people to prison for smoking cannabis, they had to show that
its use was harmful and socially damaging. But the further step
of legalizing cannabis depended on amassing proof, over a period
of time, that cannabis was not a social menace.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Report went out of its way to credit the
influence of the Times advertisement. I quote from an article in
the Guardian diary which was planted with a view to facilitating
Callaghan's denunciation of the Report. It was a set up,
illustrated by a photograph.&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">Soft Sell&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">LOBBYISTS are the great unseen, the great
    unhonoured, not least by Government enquiries. But Steve
    Abrams' pot-boilers have never been that kind of lobby, and
    the Wootton Committee isn't that kind of enquiry. The
    Cannabis report out this morning delivers a rare and specific
    testimonial:&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">&quot;Our first enquiries were proceeding -
    without publicity - into the pharmacological and medical
    aspects when other developments gave our study new and much
    increased significance. An advertisement in the Times on the
    24th of July 1967 represented that the long asserted dangers
    of cannabis were exaggerated and that the related law was
    socially damaging, if not unworkable. This was followed by a
    wave of debate about these issues in Parliament, the Press
    and elsewhere, and reports of enquiries e.g. by the National
    Council for Civil Liberties. This publicity made more
    explicit the nature of some current &quot;protest&quot; about
    official policy on drugs; defined more clearly some of the
    main issues in our study; and led us to give greater
    attention to the legal aspects of the problem. Government
    spokesmen made it clear that any future development of policy
    on cannabis would have to take account of the Advisory
    Committee's report. Accordingly, we decided to give first
    priority to presenting our views on cannabis.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">Publication of the Wootton Report provoked an
organized campaign of vilification in the popular press. A famous
headline in The Daily Express described the Report as a
&quot;junkies charter.&quot; Some people in high places and some
vested interests were getting worried. Until then, the issue of
legalizing cannabis had seemed to be a joke.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In the Parliamentary debate on the Wootton
Report on January 29th, 1969, Callaghan gave his reasons for
rejecting, or ostensibly rejecting, the Wootton Report:</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;I think it came as a surprise, if not
    a shock, to most people when that notorious advertisement
    appeared in the Times in 1967 to find that there is a lobby
    for legalizing cannabis. The House should recognize that this
    lobby exists, and my reading of the Report is that the
    Wootton sub-committee was overinfluenced by this lobby. I had
    the same impression as the Rt. Hon. and learned gentleman
    (Quintin Hogg) that it was compromise at the end; that those
    who were in favour of legalizing 'pot' were all the time
    pushing the other members back, so that eventually these
    remarkable conclusions emerged, that it would be wrong to
    legalize it but that the penalties should be reduced. The
    existence of this lobby is something that the House and
    public opinion should take into account and be ready to
    combat, as I am. It is another aspect of the so-called
    permissive society, and I am glad that my decision has
    enabled the house to call a halt in the advancing tide of
    so-called permissiveness.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;Articles in the Evening Standard
(February 3rd) and other newspapers said that the Chairman of the
Advisory Council, Sir Edward Wayne and Lady Wootton were both
contemplating resignation to mark their protest against the Home
Secretary's insulting remarks in Parliament. On February 5th the
Times published a joint letter from them, which said, in
part:&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">We regard this statement as offensive to
    our distinguished colleagues and to ourselves, and
    particularly to the eminent medical men who signed our
    Report, and we particularly deprecate the implication of the
    emotive word 'lobby' in this context. We would also point out
    that after hearing the evidence no member of the
    sub-committee recommended legalization.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">In October I wrote in the Soma Newsletter (np.
3, pp. 4-5) that Callaghan, for all his blustering, had little
option other than to change the law:&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">The Government is now drafting
    comprehensive new legislation on psychotropic drugs,
    including cannabis. The legislation aims at introducing more
    flexible control of drugs and consolidating the control
    presently exercised in respect of the Dangerous Drugs Act and
    the Drugs (Prevention of Misuse) Act. Apparently the new
    legislation will distinguish between drugs by introducing a
    two tiered system of penalties for what may, for convenience,
    be termed &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; drugs. Our
    understanding is that the problem of whether to classify
    cannabis as a hard or soft drug has not yet been faced. It is
    felt, however, that because the Home Secretary has asked the
    Wootton Committee to continue in its advisory capacity, it
    will be very difficult to justify the continued
    classification of cannabis as a hard drug in the context of
    new legislation. ...</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">It should be recalled that despite his
    posturing the Home Secretary did not refuse to implement the
    Wootton Report. He merely refused to legislate unilaterally
    and immediately on cannabis at a time when new comprehensive
    legislation was already being planned.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">The story of implementing the Wootton Report is
told in a little noticed passage in the Crossman diaries.(pp.
836-7) After the legislation had been through the Home Affairs
Committee, there was an &quot;absolutely outrageous press
leak.&quot; This presumably refers to a page one lead in the
Sunday Mirror on February 1st, 1970 :&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">DRUG LAW SHOCK Jim Changes his Mind.
    Penalties for 'pot' smokers to be cut.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Home Secretary James Callaghan has has had
    a dramatic change of mind on drugs. He has decided that
    people who smoke 'pot' should no longer be punished as
    severely as those using heroin. He has gone further by
    deciding that the penalties for possessing both hard and soft
    drugs should be cut.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">... Mr. Callaghan only a year ago
    championed the cause of holding the line against drug
    permissiveness. ...Last year Mr. Callaghan denounced what he
    called &quot;a notorious advertisement&quot; in the Times -
    signed by many public figures including the Beatles - which
    urged that possessing cannabis should either be legalized, or
    at most punishable by a fine of not more than #25.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">Crossman's diary entry for Thursday February
26th says that Callaghan had come back to the cabinet to say that
&quot;he now proposed not to have any reduction at all in any
penalties on cannabis.&quot; Crossman notes that this was
unusual. &quot;One usually only brings things to Cabinet when
there is disagreement at a Cabinet Committee.&quot; As the
discussion continued &quot;it became absolutely clear that the
issue was whether to kowtow to public opinion or not.&quot; The
Cabinet divided. &quot;Every member of the cabinet who had been
to university voted one way and everyone else voted the
other.&quot; Wilson voted with the antis. Having been outvoted by
a clear majority, Callaghan published his Misuse of Drugs Bill on
March 11th.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The myth that Callaghan refused to implement
the proposals of the Wootton Report owes its survival to the fact
that the labour government was defeated in the general election
of 1970. However, the legislation was bipartisan and it was
reintroduced by Reginald Maudling for the tories. It became law
as the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. The maximum penalty for
possession of cannabis on summary conviction was reduced by half
to six months. When the Act received the Royal Assent in 1973 the
Lord Chancellor, Lord Hailsham (formerly Quintin Hogg), advised
the conference of the Magistrates Association on sentencing.
(Times, 12 October 1973) He reasserted the insistence of the
Advisory Council that minor offences did not merit imprisonment.
Lord Hailsham told magistrates to treat cannabis users with
&quot;becoming moderation.&quot; He said: &quot;Set aside your
prejudice, if you have one, and reserve the sentence of
imprisonment for suitably flagrant cases of large scale
trafficking.&quot; It must have been difficult for him to set
aside his own prejudice long enough to say that, but he
did!&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Ten years after the Wootton report, Ronald Butt
wrote in The Times, without intended irony, that we should be
grateful to Callaghan who put his foot down and saved us from the
permissive society by rejecting the Wootton Report. (17 March
1979) When he wrote this article Butt should have known that the
Criminal Justice Act of 1977 had reduced the maximum sentence on
summary conviction for possession to three months, less than the
four months proposed in the Wootton Report. He should also have
been aware of the 1978 Report on Sentencing of the Advisory
Council, which proposed a further reduction in penalties, ending
the status of possession of cannabis as an &quot;arrestable
offence&quot; (i.e. one for which a warrant is not required to
make an arrest) and abolishing the residual powers of the courts
to deprive offenders of their liberty. However, the Report noted
that the Courts were already observing this condition in
practice; they no longer imposed prison sentences for simple
possession offences.*&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Margaret Thatcher was heavily indebted to the
tobacco and alcohol lobbies. She sought to use the drugs issue
for political purposes. The wise counsel of civil servants and
professional advisers was by-passed when a planeload of tame MPs
departed for a Cooks Tour of American lowlife organized by the
U.S. Drugs Enforcement Agency.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Thatcher opened the doors to smugglers by
reducing the number of customs staff and she spent several
million pounds of public money on advertisements for the use of
heroin and cocaine, against the advice of the Advisory Council.
But the use of cannabis was so widespread that any attempt to
focus on its dangers would have derailed the entire campaign.
Cannabis was not singled out for attention and soon references to
cannabis became conspicuous by their absence. There was no way to
stress the dangers of narcotics without pointing up the relative
harmlessness of cannabis. On this issue Thatcher was caught in a
trap of her own making. Of course she refused to implement the
further proposals for cannabis law reform made in the 1978 Report
on Sentencing and re-affirmed in the 1982 Report on
Cannabis.&quot; However, she did make a crucial concession,
granting Chief Constables discretion to caution offenders rather
than bring them to trial. This practise has grown and now the
majority of offenders are cautioned and thus escape
conviction.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>* <font size="3">Report on A Review of the Classification of
Controlled Drugs and of Penalties Under Schedules 2 and 4 of the
Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (15 December 1978)&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Advisory Committee on Drug Dependence was
an ad hoc body. The Misuse of Drugs Act made it a statutory body
akin to the Poisons Board. It was renamed the Advisory Council on
the Misuse of Drugs.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">** Home Office Advisory Council on the Misuse
of Drugs - Report of the Expert Group on the Effects of Cannabis
Use (1982).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Wootton Report was implemented twenty years
ago. Since that time we have had a &quot;half-way house&quot;,
and possession of cannabis has been virtually
&quot;decriminalized.&quot; One solicitor, Bernard Simons, who
has dealt with many drugs cases, described the present situation
in The Independent on July 22nd:&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">... For me, twenty-five years ago, it was
    really important in my life - as a libertarian issue. Today
    the police rarely prosecute; they're told to administer
    cautions, and even bringing small amounts into the country
    doesn't lead to court. In my youth, in Notting Hill, people
    were stopped and searched all the time. and they had nothing
    on them. You used to have police raids on parties, where
    they'd find a bit of cannabis and arrest everyone in the
    room. Twelve people would appear in court charged with the
    same bit of cannabis. It doesn't happen any more, certainly
    not in London - though I can't speak for rural Wales. &nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">The police arrest users by accident. If they
are looking for a dealer or a thief and they find some 'dope',
they make a charge. The few cases that show up in the statistics
as leading to imprisonment are artefacts; for example, a sentence
served concurrently for possession of cannabis and another more
serious drug or non drug offence. In some other cases the
quantities of cannabis seized are rather large.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A decision to legalize cannabis in the context
of EC drug policy would be bolstered by the results of such
research as has been done in the past twenty years, mainly in
America. However, the decision is likely to depend on the size
and growth of the market. The media have muddied the waters by
exaggerating the extent of cannabis smoking in the 1960s. A
leader and several articles in The Independent have insisted that
cannabis use is currently greater than at any time since the
1960s. In fact, official statistics imply a steady growth in
cannabis use over the past quarter century. The total of cannabis
seized in 1967 was 295 kilos and 457 plants. Currently seizures
are running at about 1,000 kilos per week. In twenty-five years
seizures have increased by two orders of magnitude.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Cannabis is normally sold in the form of
hashish at a price of about #30 for a quarter of an ounce. That
is a week's supply for a user who smokes all day every day. I
assume that a typical user smokes cannabis two or three times a
week and consumes about a sixteenth of an ounce per week. On this
basis, the current level of seizures alone would be enough to
support a user population of half a million. But the customs use
a notional figure of five or ten per cent for the average level
of seizures.* It is therefore likely that there are several
million regular cannabis smokers in Britain, up to ten per cent
of the population. Probably the market has been saturated.
Cannabis is not everyone's cup of tea, and many people do not
enjoy its effects or are unable to experience any effect at all
from taking it. The experience of decriminalization in Holland is
that further relaxation of control does not produce any long term
increase in use.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">* In the 'sixties the proportion of seizures
was probably lower than it is today, partially because the
penalties did not distinguish users from suppliers.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The legalization of cannabis may now be on the
cards, but how will it be done? &quot;Legalization&quot; is an
extremely vague expression. My personal view has always been that
the vendor should be the State; that any other solution would
introduce a vested interest in maximizing the use of cannabis,
and, in one way or another, advertising it. In oral evidence to
the Wootton sub-committee on December 5th, 1967 I said that the
recent legalization of gambling had been a disaster because the
crooks who controlled illegal gambling remained in control of
legalized gambling. Yet there is today, in 1993, a strong opinion
in favour of legitimizing the existing trade in drugs, much of
which is in the hands of organized crime and terrorist
groups.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Mr. Lucas, a psychiatrist, asked me if I
thought the tobacco companies should sell cannabis to help them
to phase out of the production of tobacco. I said that the
tobacco companies should not be allowed to sell cannabis and that
I doubted they should even be permitted to sell tobacco.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Originally, I hoped that cannabis could be made
available through liberal prescribing of standardized
preparations. Since the 1970s I have supported those who favour a
rationing system loosely tied to the National Health System. I
think that prospective users should be required to purchase a
cannabis licence, which could be obtained from a NHS surgery. The
licence would allow them to purchase up to the equivalent of one
ounce of cannabis per month from a chemists shop. This would make
it a slight nuisance to obtain cannabis. The doctor would not be
asked to prescribe the drug, but would be entitled to know his
patient was a cannabis user. All profits from such a scheme could
go to the NHS. It would be worth a few billions per annum. In
this way the gangsters are cut out, a small overflow is provided,
the forms of cannabis available are standardized and purified,
and the profits go to a good cause. Moreover, such a scheme would
be reversible. A detailed consideration of alternative licensing
systems was provided in a book, Cannabis : Options for Change,
published by the semi-official Institute for the Study of Drug
Dependence in 1979.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Hopefully, the solution of nationalizing
cannabis may be the only one which is compatible with the control
requirements of the UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, to
which Britain is a signatory. The Convention requires all states
to enact laws prohibiting the &quot;possession&quot; of cannabis
and providing for deprivation of liberty in suitable cases. This
convention was brought in as a result of long pressure from the
U. S. Treasury, which acts on behalf of the alcohol lobby in
America, and controlled or prohibited cannabis in America in the
same way that it prohibited &quot;moonshine&quot;, as tax
evasion. The Federal Bureau of Narcotics controlled by H. J.
Anslinger, a former commissioner of prohibition and a relative of
Hoover's, was part of the U.S. Treasury. It was succeeded by the
Drugs Enforcement Authority, which is part of the Department of
Justice.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Wootton Report was followed by similar
reports in other countries including the </font><a
href="../ledain/NONMED.HTM"><font size="3">Le Dain Report</font></a><font
size="3"> in Canada and the </font><a href="../nc/ncmenu.htm"><font
size="3">Shafer Report</font></a><font size="3"> in America.
Following publication of the latter, by a Presidential
Commission, the government looked into the legal status of
cannabis under the Single Convention. Apparently, they obtained
an opinion based on the French text of the Convention that the
offence of possession&quot; had the meaning of the offence
described in British law as &quot;possession with intent to
sell&quot; as opposed to simple possession. The conclusion seemed
to be that cannabis could be legalized, though only with the
state acting as the seller.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">It will, however, be difficult or impossible to
resist a claim from the tobacco industry. For example, one
tobacco company pays Lady Thatcher a fee in excess of #1,000,000
p.a. to act as a &quot;consultant.&quot; Such sums are paid out
to protect the public image of an industry which may have killed
off a hundred million people worldwide in the course of the
twentieth century. To the tobacco industry the Single Convention
is a paper tiger.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On the 8th of July 1968, the News of the World
devoted its entire pre-tabloid front page to an attack on me.
There was a marvelous picture, borrowed from the Sunday Times and
retouched, and an arrow pointing at my head. The headline said:
This dangerous man MUST be stopped! The article had no content;
it attacked my plans to manufacture small quantities of THC for
research purposes but admitted that the Home Office was aware of
the project and had no objection to it.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Four days later, on the 12th of July, the
Oxford drugs squad searched the digs of a gentleman named Stephen
Abraham, who lived with his landlady, Miss Susan Ratcliffe, in a
house at 88, Sunningwell Road. A roach, a spent cannabis
cigarette, was found in the room he occupied with Miss Ratcliffe.
The police also found an empty bottle of tincture of cannabis and
some tobacco with a green tinge. Stephen Abraham was an American
and a member of Pembroke College. He had just taken first class
honours in maths. He smoked dope like a chimney and he too had a
prescription (arranged by me) from Dr. Dunbar.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I am sorry that Graham Greene (a signatory to
the Soma advertisement) is not alive to read this, to learn about
the &quot;other Steve Abrams&quot; I kept in Oxford to get
arrested on my behalf.*&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Steve Abraham beat a strategic retreat to
America, but on August 1st, his girlfriend, Miss Ratcliffe, was
charged with the absolute offence of allowing him to smoke
cigarettes dipped in cannabis tincture in their room. The Court
and the police accepted that Abraham had a legal
prescription.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The case was heard at Oxford City Magistrates
Court on October 17th, 1968. The Bench of Magistrates, included
Mrs. H. Y. Bullock, wife of Sir Alan Bullock, the Head of my
College, then elevated to the rank of Vice Chancellor. She must
have been aware of the deliberate confusion of identities. Soma
paid half the cost of the defence, who were represented by our
solicitor, Martin Polden. Expert evidence for the defence was
provided by Dr. Ann Robinson, assistant to Professor Francis
Camps at London Hospital. (Dr. Robinson is now Professor of
Ferensic Medicine at London Hospital Medical College.)&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I have no criminal record and have never been
charged with any drugs offence. I was an Advanced Student of St.
Catherine's College from 1960 to 1967. I have never met Miss
Ratcliffe and have never been to 88, Sunningwell Road, Oxford. In
1968 I lived at 81, Holland Road, London W11 with Jane Firbank,
to whom I was then married.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The forensic scientist from Aldermaston who
gave evidence for the police said that his tests did not
distinguish between cannabis resin and extract of cannabis. He
promptly concluded that they were the same substance. He insisted
that the product of evaporating the alcohol in tincture of
cannabis (made by adding alcohol to extract of cannabis) was in
fact cannabis resin, whereas the extract was made by percolating
cannabis leaf (marijuana) in alcohol. It contained only those
components of cannabis that dissolved in alcohol.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">It was argued in evidence that Abraham was
entitled to be in possession of a bottle of tincture of cannabis
but not to open it. If a fraction of the alcohol that the extract
was mixed with evaporated, that would be a step in the direction
of &quot;manufacturing cannabis resin.&quot; By the same token,
opening a bottle of cough syrup might be construed as a step in
the direction of manufacturing morphine. By pouring the contents
of a bottle of tincture of cannabis, cost 30/onto a tin of
tobacco, Abraham was supposed to have, transformed the house into
a &quot;factory&quot; for manufacturing Ireefers', according to a
report in The Times. According to The Telegraph, Abraham
manufactured enough cannabis &quot;to supply five hospitals for
seven years.&quot; That is to say, he used up a bottle of
tincture of cannabis, the same amount used by the five Oxford
hospitals over the past seven years.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This case was upheld on appeal by Brian
Gibbens, the Recorder of Oxford on January 11th, 1969, four days
after the Wootton Report was published. The decision was
criticised in legal and medical journals for making a nonsense of
the law and it was ignored outside Oxford. However, the
impression was created that following a campaign in the New of
the World, I had been convicted (in absentia) of
&quot;manufacturing&quot; cannabis resin in Oxford.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This may be a great joke, but it got on my
credit records here and in America, and it left the police with
an open warrant in my name. I was picked up several times in
London, the premises of Soma were raided, and I realized that it
was time to pack it in. Callaghan had just published his Drugs
Bill, so I could claim a victory.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">There is buried somewhere in the personal
columns of The Times, probably in January or February 1969 a
small announcement advertising the fact that Steve Abrams is not
Steve Abrams &amp;c.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On July 24th 1992, twenty-five years after the
publication of the Soma advertisement, a new full paged
advertisement appeared in The Times, sponsored by the Release
Legal Emergency and Drugs Service Ltd., registered charity no.
801118.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Registered charities are not permitted to
campaign for law reform, but Release, in soliciting contributions
to defray the cost (#17,000) of the advertisement altered their
stationery to remove the designation of their charitable status
and allowed the press, e.g.? the Independent, to describe them as
a &quot;soft drugs campaigning group.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Prospective contributors and signatories to the
Release advertisement were sent a poster reproduction of the Soma
advertisement, together with advice that affirmed or strongly
implied that they had published the original as their calling
card, twenty-five years earlier. None of the signatories to the
Release advertisement got to see the embarrassing document to
which their names were appended.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I told the organizers of the Release
advertisement that they were in breach of copyright in
circulating posters of the Soma advertisement, and that they were
also guilty of the additional offence of &quot;passing off.&quot;
The Director of Release, Michael Goodman, a barrister, and one of
the &quot;founders&quot; of the organization, Mr. Rufus Harris, a
law clerk, ignored my protestations and authorised the use of a
photograph of me, ostensibly smoking a joint, on the invitation
to their 25th anniversary party.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Release did come into existence in 1967, but it
took no significant part in the cannabis law reform movement of
the late sixties. To begin with, Release was a 24 hour referral
service for a group of solicitors who specialised in defending
drugs cases. Release would have cut itself off from reputable
sources of funding had it campaigned for the legalization of
cannabis. The solicitors, who were onto a good thing, would have
been compromised.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The earliest reference to Release in The Times
is in October 1967 and all of the references are to fund raising
stunts arranged by Carolyn Coon or criticisms of the police. More
surprisingly, perhaps, there is no reference to Release in the
&quot;pot people's newspaper&quot; International Times in the
summer of 1967. A complete history of the early work of Release
is given in The Release Report by Caroline Coon and Rufus Harris
(Sphere Books, 1969). This book covers the wider interests of the
authors in the drugs problem but the text contains no reference
to the Wootton Report or to an advertisement in the Times. The
authors seem to think it wrong to, as James Callaghan said,
&quot;look at one drug in isolation.&quot; They content
themselves with a bland and ambiguous injunction, still in use,
to &quot;change the drug laws.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">If this seems tame, it is. Release has a
government grant of #3,000 per week, covering sixty per cent of
its operating expenditure. In twenty-five years Release has not
done anything adventurous, nor has it published any worthwhile
research. Now independent action is out of the question. The
orchestrated pre-publicity for the 1992 advertisement, with the
media acting in concert, regurgitating handouts from the Home
Office Press office was an embarassing confirmation of the extent
of news management in the one party state that is Britain
today.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I know that things are hard, and that an
organization like Release must be encouraged to establish its
street credibility and to raise money on its own by tapping a
vein of sympathy among a drug using population of several
millions and preaching to the converted. I am not happy about
Release living on my good will, but I am amused that the Home
Office now want to get in on the act, to claim that they
themselves inspired the 1967 advertisement.&nbsp;</font></p>

<h1>The Wootton Report</h1>

<p><b>Extract from 'The Strange Case of Pot' by Michael Schofield
(Penguin, 1971). </b></p>

<hr>

<p>Schofield was a social psychologist who sat on the Wootton
Committee and, dismayed by its reception, which led to the
introduction of the Misuse of Drugs Act, he subsequently
published this book. </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In the introduction, he writes: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The original title of this book was to have been 'The
    Case For And Against Pot.' It was intended to present both
    sides of the controversy and weight the evidence before
    coming to a conclusion. But once the myths were cleared, it
    became obvious that the case for and against was not evenly
    balanced. By any ordinary standards of objectivity, it is
    clear that cannabis is not a very harmful drug. But the
    simple ranging of issues side by side is to superficial an
    approach for what is a very complex situation - really a
    social problem, much less a legal problem, and still less a
    medical problem.' </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The book is divided into three major parts. In the first
    five chapters I present the basic information about cannabis
    and compare it with the other illegal drugs. In the next six
    chapters I try to explain the public attitudes to cannabis
    and discuss the main controversies. In the last five chapters
    I attempt to describe the legal and sociological aspects, and
    end by suggesting a more sensible plan of action.' </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 7, The Wootton Report</h2>

<p>- In this chapter, Schofield discusses the background to the
establishment of the Wootton Committee and then goes on to
outline the committee's recommendations, elucidating each one. </p>

<h3>Other Reports</h3>

<p>At first Government committees were only concerned with the
opiates, and in particular with heroin addiction. The two reports
of the Interdepartmental Committee under Lord Brain in 1961 and
1965 hardly mentioned cannabis. In the first report the committee
decided that cannabis was not within their terms of reference and
concluded: 'In our view cannabis is not a drug of addiction; it
is an intoxicant.' In the second report they noted briefly that
there is 'a risk that young people may be persuaded to turn to
cannabis' which was something of an understatement even in 1965. </p>

<p>One important recommendation in the second Brain report was to
set up a Standing Advisory Committee to keep under review the
whole problem of drug dependence. As this was not a static but a
changing problem, it would be useful to bring together a group of
experts with authority to advise to advise on the social as well
as the medical aspects. This committee was set up in early 1967
under the Chairmanship of Sir Edward Wayne, MD, PhD, DSc, FRCP,
FRCP(G). Twenty-two other members were appointed, nine of whom
were doctors. A small secretariat was formed to help the
committee, but there was no money to pay for research and no
special facilities. Some of the members were doctors treating
addicts, but most of them had only a limited amount of knowledge
of drugs although all of them have learnt over the years. </p>

<p>Without the facilities to initiate or carry out research, this
committee cannot be expected to provide new facts or make
important discoveries. All that the members can do is to discuss
the matter between themselves and listen from time to time to
witnesses called to give evidence because they are experts in
some particular aspect of drug use. But nearly everyone who gives
evidence to this committee does so as the representative of an
organisation which has a special interest in drugs. Conflicting
views will be heard from the representatives of other
organisations. The function of the committee is essentially
judicial and its purpose is to reconcile the conflicting claims
of its witnesses. As there is a wide variety of opinion
represented among the members, the suggested solutions to the
various problems of drug dependence are obtained by compromising
between opposing views. The reports which are issued from time to
time usually consist of an aggregation of existing opinions.
including those of the chairman, the committee members, and the
witnesses. A research team of three or four people working full
time is more likely to produce more penetrating and workable
solutions to the problems of drug use than a committee of
prominent citizens meeting three or four times a year to compile
and select from conflicting expert opinions. </p>

<p>None the less the committee has been able to give useful
advice to the Home Office and Ministry of Social Security on the
best way to implement the earlier recommendations of the Brain
committee. Treatment centres for heroin addicts have been set up
and special arrangements were introduced to control the outbreak
of methedrine injections. Perhaps the most important work has
been done in the sub-committees which have met more regularly
than the main committee. There have been sub-committees on
rehabilitation (published as a report by HMSO in 1969) and health
education (the results were circularised by the Department of
Education), amphetamines, LSD, and the powers of search and
arrest (these reports were published by HMSO in 1970). In April
1967 a special sub-committee was appointed to review the
available evidence on the pharmacological, clinical,
pathological, social and legal aspects of cannabis. After
seventeen meetings under the chairmanship of Baroness Wootton,
the sub-committee's report was published in January 1969. </p>

<hr>

<h2>The Recommendations</h2>

<p><b>(1) We recommend that in the interest of public health, it
is necessary for the time being to maintain restrictions on the
availability of cannabis.</b> </p>

<p>- Although it is stated in the report that the consumption of
cannabis in moderate doses has no harmful effects, the committee
felt less sure about the mental effects. This recommendation,
therefore, is intended to be a temporary measure and should be
reviewed from time to time, when more is known about the effects
as a result of medical and social research. Meanwhile the courts
should recognise that there is considerable variation in the
personalities and motives of people who use cannabis. </p>

<p><b>(2) Every encouragement, both academic and financial,
should be given to suitable projects for enquiry into the
cannabis problem.</b> </p>

<p>- It follows that if there is a lack of information on an
important and controversial problem, every effort should be made
to provide research facilities. Although three working parties
have been set up by the medical Research Council and an Institute
for the Study of Drug Dependence has been established, progress
is very slow. It is inevitable that research into drug use will
be a lengthy business, but it is disquieting that even three
years after the formation of the Government's Advisory Committee,
very few large-scale research projects have even been started. </p>

<p>In March 1970, the Home Office issued a list of research on
drug dependence. This list contained ten biochemical and
pharmacological studies, mainly concerned with the developments
of techniques for detecting cannabis in the body. there were no
cannabis studies listed under the clinical and treatment section.
Five studies were listed under the social and psychological
section; three of these (Chapple, 1966; Paton, 1968; Tylden,
1968) who had written papers strongly opposed to the use of
cannabis even before starting the research; only one of the five
has been undertaken by a sociologist. so far the Social Science
Research Council has not supported any researches on the use of
cannabis even though it is in the area of sociology that we most
need information. </p>

<p>The Wootton committee found that it was impossible to estimate
the number of people who used cannabis and the guesses seem to
range between 30,000 and 300,000. It is clearly impossible to
make sense of statements about the social consequences of
widespread use of cannabis until there are some reliable
estimates of the prevalence of regular users. No detailed
information is available about the extent of cannabis use by
immigrants. There is an immediate need for sociological and
psychological studies to define the different social groups and
to describe the personalities of people who smoke cannabis.
People do not hesitate to criticise the young for taking drugs,
but in fact no one knows how many adolescents do take cannabis,
how many use the drug only occasionally at parties and week-ends,
and how many take it regularly. Only a well-planned research
would show if there are differentiating characteristics between
users who take only cannabis and people who used to take cannabis
but have now given up all drug use. </p>

<p><b>(3) The law should progressively be recast to give
Parliament greater flexibility of control over individual drugs.</b>
</p>

<p>- This was one of the few recommendations which the Home
Secretary found acceptable, although it seems likely that he does
not interpret the 'greater flexibility of control' in the same
sense as the Wootton Committee. Mr Callaghan, speaking during the
debate on the Wootton report, said that he would put before the
House proposals which would give him more power to handle the
problem in a much more flexible manner. He then went on to
criticise the restrictions of the 1964 Drugs Act which in fact
does not apply to cannabis. He wanted the power to bring new
synthetic drugs under the Act as they were developed and became
popular with users, and he also mentioned the need to have
stronger legal control over manufacturers, doctors, chemists, and
others who distribute the drugs. he felt that there was 'a clear
risk that each new fashion of drug taking will find new gaps in
the defences, which will only be plugged too late' and the
solution would be 'to have a single comprehensive code which
would rationalise and strengthen the Government's powers.'
(Quoted from Hansard, 27 January, 1969, column 967). There is
much substance in Mr Callaghan's remarks about changing fashions
in the drugs scene but this has nothing to do with the Wootton
report which is about cannabis, a drug that is already
fashionable and is hardly ever prescribed by medical men. It is
difficult to see what the Home Secretary's call for new
legislation has to do with cannabis unless he feels that one drug
is much like another, an attitude of mind that Lady Wootton and
her colleagues were most anxious to alter. </p>

<p>The Wootton committee suggested changes in the law because
there is now a better understanding of the reasons why people use
drugs. Criminological studies have cast doubts on the
effectiveness of deterrents and the general law on the treatment
of offenders has been changed considerable. The committee felt
that 'the penalties for cannabis offences have gone unreviewed
for too long'. Their idea of flexibility was that the law should
be adjusted according to the dangers of the drug and the way it
is misused. </p>

<p><b>(4) The association in legislation of cannabis and heroin
and the other opiates is inappropriate and new legislation to
deal specifically and separately with cannabis and its synthetic
derivatives should be introduced as soon as possible.</b> </p>

<p>- There are two reasons for this. Many people agree that the
confusion between cannabis and heroin leads to misunderstandings
and, in some cases, to injustice. The committee also stated quite
clearly that the present penalties for possession of cannabis
were altogether too high. The Government accepted the third
recommendation for reasons other than those given by the
committee, and after some hesitation, the fourth recommendation
was also incorporated into the new (Misuse of Drugs) Bill,
although the penalties for possession of cannabis are still
severe. </p>

<p><b>(5) Unlawful possession of cannabis without knowledge
should not be an offence. The practicability of distinguishing
between possession intended for use and possession intended for
supply should be examined.</b> </p>

<p>- This brings to notice two of the several difficulties
encountered in a law which is about possession when what we are
really concerned about is the misuse of drugs. Although a recent
test case was taken as far as the House of Lords the resulting
decision was by no means clear because the issues in that
particular case were complex. The law should make it quite
certain that a person cannot be incriminated, for example, by
someone putting cannabis in his coat pocket without his
knowledge. The police maintain that is extremely difficult to
catch someone in the act of dealing in cannabis or any other
drug. The unsatisfactory solution to this problem under the 1965
Act was to retain high maximum penalties for the offence of
possession so that the courts could sentence a man who had been
found guilty of one offence (i.e. possession) as if he has been
found guilty of another (i.e. supply). It is a form of justice
that is open to question, it is a bit like the bench saying to a
motorist: 'You have been caught exceeding the speed limit and we
have been told that you had been drinking rather heavily;
however, we can't prove that you were drunk, so we are going to
give you a very heavy sentence for speeding.' The proposals for
the new legislation allow this practise to continue: although the
new offence of 'possession with intent to supply' is introduced,
a maximum penalty of five years for the possession of cannabis is
proposed. It is difficult to imagine a situation where the simple
possession of cannabis deserves such a severe sentence. The new
Bill distinguishes between possession and trafficking and
increases the penalty for selling cannabis to a maximum of
fourteen years. This reflects the public demand for heavy
penalties for traffickers which is based on a misunderstanding of
the role of the dealer. Nevertheless if a man is making money out
of selling an illegal substance, it is reasonable to expect him
to be dealt with more severely than someone who is merely using
the drug. </p>

<p><b>(6) Possession of a small amount of cannabis should not
normally be regarded as a serious crime to be punished by
imprisonment.</b> </p>

<p>- This is a very radical recommendation and one which caused a
large amount of adverse comment in the press. But informed
opinion is coming round to the idea that prison is not a sensible
way to treat people who wish to use cannabis. What even informed
opinion found it difficult to take was the explicit statement
that possession in not a serious crime. But the committee went
still further in paragraph 90 of the report, where they state
that prison is the wrong place even for those who supply on a
limited scale. they do not attempt to define what they mean by a
limited scale, but even a fairly strict definition would include
about nine out of ten of the transactions between users and
sellers because the amounts involved are so small. </p>

<p><b>(7) The offence of unlawful possession, sale or supply of
cannabis should be punishable on summary conviction with a fine
not exceeding 100, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding
four months, or both such fine and imprisonment. On conviction or
indictment the penalty should be an unlimited fine, or
imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or both such fine
and imprisonment.</b> </p>

<p>- Thus the committee recommended considerable reductions in
the penalties. The penalties for possession under the 1965 Act in
force when the committee reported, the penalties in the new Bill
and the penalties recommended in the Wootton report are
summarised as follows: </p>

<pre>
<font size="2">Maximum         1965 Act                1970 Bill               Wootton penalties                                                               Report
Summary conviction:
Fine                    250            400            100 Imprisonment    12 months               6 months                4 months
Indictment:
Fine                    1,000          unlimited               unlimited Imprisonment    10 years                5 years         2 years</font>
</pre>

<p>Some members of the committee argued strongly against any kind
of prison sentence for simple possession, but in the end were
persuaded to agree to a maximum penalty of four months
imprisonment because this sentence would allow the defendant the
option of going for trial by jury and also because a prison
sentence gives the judiciary the chance to deal with what the
committee called 'difficult individual cases'. The committee were
aware that a substantial part of the smuggling of cannabis is in
small amounts (paragraph 37) and is not exploited to any
significant extent by professional criminals (paragraph 38).
Therefore they expected that most cases would be dealt with
summarily by imposing a small fine. the reaction to this showed
that it was a most unpopular recommendation. The home secretary
and the opposition spokesman on Home Affairs both said that this
recommendation would make it appear that Parliament was condoning
the smoking of cannabis. ('If we were to adopt what is proposed
or started to take a namby-pampy attitude about it, we should
need our heads examined. I range myself wholeheartedly behind the
Home Secretary on this issue.' Quentin Hogg in Hansard, 27
January 1969, column 957) </p>

<p><b>(8) The existing law which inhibits research requiring the
smoking of cannabis (section 5, Dangerous Drugs Act, 1965) should
be amended to allow qualified workers to study its use both by
observation and by laboratory and social experiments.</b> </p>

<p>- There has been considerable uncertainty about the smoking of
cannabis for research purposes with the result that no serious
study has been made in this country on the effects of smoking on
humans, even in laboratory conditions. As the social factors are
even more important than the pharmacological problems, it is
essential that researchers should be free to study these
phenomena by observations and experiments outside as well as
inside the laboratory without the risk of prosecution. Although
the Home Secretary gave the lack of information as the reason for
rejecting many of the recommendations in the Wootton Report, it
was notable that he never mentioned this in the House of Commons.
In fact this was one of the earliest and most urgent of the
suggestions made by the full Standing Advisory committee, long
before the Wootton report was published. Many members realised
that their work was hindered by the shortage of information that
could only be obtained by fairly elaborate and lengthy research.
It was suggested that a short Bill should be put before
Parliament to make research on cannabis possible without the risk
of prosecution. It was thought that such a bill would not arouse
much opposition, but the Home Office advisors to the committee
felt that this plan was not practical. They maintained that for a
short Bill on the subject of research into cannabis could not be
confined to this subject and far-reaching amendments would be
added during its passage through Parliament. so it was decided to
wait until the Government was ready to introduce comprehensive
legislation into which a special clause would be included to
allow bona fide research workers to investigate the effects of
smoking cannabis. But in fact three years have been lost between
the time when the law on cannabis research might have been
changed and the introduction of this new legislation. It is
possible that much useful information could have been obtained in
that time, information which would have been invaluable during
the preparation of the new Bill and the subsequent discussion of
various proposals. </p>

<p><b>(9) Section 5 of the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1965 (permitting
premises to be used for smoking cannabis, etc.) should be
redefined in scope so as to apply to premises open to the public,
to exclude the reference to dealing in cannabis and cannabis
resin, and to remove the absolute nature of the liability on
managers.</b> </p>

<p>- This recommendation has been partly approved by the Home
Secretary in the proposals for new legislation so that occupiers
and managers commit an offence if they knowingly permit a drug to
be used or sold in their premises. This will obviate the
liability of the landlord of private premises who would have been
convicted under the old law even if he was able to show that he
did not know that pot was being smoked in his house. But the Home
Secretary has rejected the suggestion that this should only be an
offence in public premises. </p>

<p><b>(10) The Advisory Committee should undertake, as a matter
of urgency, a review of police powers of arrest and search in
relation to drug offences generally, with a view to advising the
Secretary of State on any changes that may be appropriate in the
law, particularly as regards cannabis.</b> </p>

<p>- The Wootton committee seemed to think this task was too big
for them because they felt that the question of police powers
could not be realistically considered in relation to cannabis
alone. But there is no doubt that this is a most important issue.
There is a growing public concern about the way the police are
using their powers of search and arrest and many youth workers
see this as one of the main causes of the substantial
deterioration in the relations between young people and the
police. It may be said that this recommendation is a bit timid.
In a large numbers of cases, the police search for drugs in
general, but this is not true of every case. There must be
occasions when the reasonable grounds for suspicion relate only
to the use of cannabis; for example, it is the only drug that has
a pungent smell. the very extensive police powers of search and
arrest, which may be necessary for the more harmful drugs, are
difficult to justify for cannabis, the possession of which,
according to the report, is a relatively minor offence. This
recommendation was thought to be 'a matter of urgency' and a new
sub-committee under the chairmanship of William Deedes was set up
soon after the Wootton report was published. In an early debate
on drugs Mr Deedes said in the House of Commons: 'It makes no
sense for the police to go round raiding and stripping young
people at parties to find drugs, some of which their elders treat
as a staple diet. the posture against the young becomes morally
untenable.' But his report turned out to be rather a
disappointing document, with few positive recommendations. </p>

<p><b>(11) The development of the manufacture of synthetic
cannabinols should be kept under review and, if necessary,
control should be imposed under powers provided by the Pharmacy
and Poisons Act, 1933, and The Drugs (Prevention of Misuse) Act,
1964.</b> </p>

<p>- Much progress is being made in the pharmacological study of
cannabis and the active ingredient has been synthesised. It is
possible that synthetic pot will be available in large quantities
before long, and this substance is likely to be purer and safer,
and perhaps more potent, than the product obtained from the
plant. Such a substance would not be covered by the Dangerous
Drugs Act of 1965, but the proposed legislation would make it
possible to add new products of the pharmacological industry to
the schedule of restricted drugs simply by regulations placed
before the two Houses of Parliament. </p>

<p><b>(12) Preparations of cannabis and its derivatives should
continue to be available on prescription for purposes of medical
treatment and research. Provision should be made in legislation
for records to be maintained so that the position can be kept
under review.</b> </p>

<p>- The committee did not want to hinder the few doctors who are
experimenting with the use of cannabis in the treatment of
disturbed adolescents, amphetamine dependence, alcoholism and
other conditions which are difficult medical problems. Although
there have been few indications of success in this treatment, it
is hoped that the new legislation will not interfere with these
experiments. In summary, the Wootton report found that most of
the fears about cannabis were groundless. Physically it is much
less dangerous than the other illegal drugs; most people can give
it up readily and without withdrawal symptoms. Most cannabis
users are industrious and law-abiding; there is no evidence that
in Britain it provokes the user to crime other than the crime of
possessing it. nor is there any evidence to support the widely
held belief that cannabis is a significant step in the escalation
to heroin. It was agreed that cannabis is a potent drug, like
alcohol, and that is was necessary to maintain restrictions on
its availability for the time being; these restrictions would
have to be more severe than they are for alcohol until more was
known about the long-term effects of the drug. Nevertheless it
was quite inappropriate to make cannabis subject to the same
penalties as heroin under the Dangerous Drugs Act and it was
wrong to send people to prison for the possession of a small
amount. Research has been hampered and the law should be changed
so as to encourage careful long-term investigations into the
effects of smoking cannabis. When these results are available,
the interim recommendations should be reviewed. These main
conclusions were not so very different from the results found in
earlier reports including the very thorough investigations made
in India and the city of New York, and the more recent studies
made in Canada and by the President's Commission in Washington.
But the publication of the Wootton report was greeted with a
chorus of abuse from politicians, press and the public.<br>

<p><font size="5">Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report</font> </p>

<p><font size="5">CHAPTER IX</font> </p>

<p><font size="5">SOCIAL AND RELIGIOUS CUSTOMS.</font> </p>

<hr>

<p><b>Scope of this Chapter.</b> </p>

<p>431. In the instructions issued to the Commission by the
Government of India, reference is made to the use of hemp drugs
among fakirs and ascetics who are held in veneration by large
classes of the people, and to the custom, which is believed to
obtain to a large extent in Bengal, of offering an infusion of
bhang to every guest and member of the family on the last day of
the Durga Puja. The Commission were instructed to ascertain to
what extent these and similar customs prevail in Bengal and other
parts of India, and how far the use of hemp drugs forms a part of
social, or possibly religious, ceremonial or observance.
Questions 32 and 33 of the Commission's questions were intended
to elicit information on these points.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Bengal.</b> </p>

<p>432. In Bengal there is a considerable body of evidence
dealing with these customs, and more particularly with the custom
of offering an infusion of bhang on the last day of the Durga<b> </b>Puja.
Some few witnesses, it is true, state either that no social or
religious custom with which hemp drugs are connected exists, or
that they are unaware of any such custom; but the great majority
of the witnesses either give an account of them more or less
full, or allude to them briefly as matters of common notoriety.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Durga Puja.</b> </p>

<p>433. The custom of offering an infusion of the leaves of the
hemp plant to every guest and member of the family on the Bijoya
Dasami, or last day of the Durga Puja, is common in Bengal, and
may almost be said to be universal. It is alluded to by many of
the witnesses who refer to its use on this occasion as well as on
other days of the Durga Puja festival. But, while there can be no
doubt as to the existence of the custom, there is considerable
divergence of opinion as to the true nature of it. The custom
itself is a simple one. On the last day of this great festival
the male members of the family go forth to consign the image to
the waters and on their return the whole family with their guests
exchange greetings and embrace one another. During this rejoicing
a cup containing an infusion of the leaves of the hemp plant is
handed round, and all are expected to partake thereof, or at
least to place it to the lips in token of acceptance. Sweetmeats
containing hemp are also distributed. Opinion is almost equally
divided as to whether the custom is a mere social observance, or
whether it is an essential part of the religious ceremonial of
the festival. There is difference whether there is any injunction
in theof opinion among the witnesses as to <i>Shastras </i>rendering
obligatory the consumption of hemp; but Tantric religious works
sanction the use, and the custom whatever be its origin may now
be said from immemorial usage to be regarded by many people as
part of their religious observances. From the evidence of the
witnesses it would appear that there is no specific direction in
the <i>Shastras </i>of the manner in which the drug should be
used but from the references quoted it would appear that the use
alluded to is authority that of bhang in <i>the </i>form of an
infusion. Witnesses who can speak Mahamahon hopadhya Mahesa
Chandra Nyayaratna, C.I<font face="Courier New"> <font size="2"><tt>on
the subject, such as </font></tt></font><font size="4">Principal
of the Government Sanskrit College, Calcutta, testify to
religious sanction for the use of bhang or siddhi, while many
witnesses of high social position, well acquainted with the
habits of the people, as, for example, Maharaja Sir Jotindra
Mohain Tagore, K.C.S.I., Maharaja Durga Charan Law, Raja Piari
Mohan Mukharji, C.S.I., Rai Rajkumar Sarvadhikari Bahadur, Rai
Bahadur Kanai Lall . Day, C.I.E., and others, speak to the
prevalence of the custom, its intimate association with the
religious devotions of the people, and the innocent harmlessness
of the practice.<br>
</font></p>

<p><b>Other occasions on which bhang is used.</b> </p>

<p>434. The custom described above, and which refers solely to
bhang as distinguished from other preparations of the hemp plant,
is he most important occasion on which bhang is used as a part of
social or religious ceremonies; but there is evidence to show
that the drug in this form is used at other festivals. For
example, at the Holi festival, which is observed more generally
in Behar than in other parts of the Lower Provinces, bhang is
commonly consumed; and, according to many witnesses, at such
festivals as the Diwali, Chait Sankranti, Pous Sankranti,
Sripanchami, Sivachaturdasi, Ramnavami, and indeed on occasions
of weddings and many other family festivities. But, so far as the
evidence shows, the use on those occasions is a matter of social
custom observed more generally in some parts of the province than
in others, and, although nodoubt there may be some who consider
it essential to their devotions, partaking but little of the
nature of general religious observance. In Orissa bhang is
largely used by the attendants and worshippers at the temple of
Jagannath at Puri; and there appears also to exist a custom,
somewhat similar to that of the Durga Puja in Bengal, of offering
siddhi or bhang in the form of sweetmeats to the god Ganesh,
which are then eaten by the worshippers and their friends and
relatives. This festival, called the Ganesh Chaturthi, occurs in
the month of Bhadro (August-September).<br>
</p>

<p><b>Connection of ganja with the worship of Siva.</b> </p>

<p>435. It is chiefly in connection with the worship of Siva, the
Mahadeo or great god of the Hindu trinity, that the hemp plant,
and more especially perhaps ganja, is associated. The hemp plant
is popularly believed to have been a great favourite of Siva, and
there is a great deal of evidence before the Commission to show
that the drug in some form or other is now extensively used in
the exercise of the religious practices connected with this form
of worship. Reference to the almost universal use of hemp drugs
by fakirs, jogis, sanyasis, and ascetics of all classes, and more
particularly of those devoted to the worship of Siva, will be
found in the paragraphs of this report dealing with the classes
of the people who consume the drugs. These religious ascetics,
who are regarded with great veneration by the people at large,
believe that the hemp plant is a special attribute of the god
Siva, and this belief is largely shared by the people. Hence the
of many fond epithets ascribing to ganja the significance of a
divine pro-party, and the common practice of invoking the deity
in terms of adoration before placing the <i>chillum </i>or pipe
of ganja to the lips. There is evidence to show that on almost
all occasions of the worship of this god, the hemp drugs in some
form or other are used by certain classes of the people it is
established by the evidence of Mahamabopadhya Mahesa Chandra
Nyayaratna and of other witnesses that siddhi is offered to the
image of Siva at Benares, Baldynath, Tarakeswar, and elsewhere.
At the Shivratri festival, and on almost all occasions before the
on which this worship is practised, there is abundant evidence
Commission which shows not only that ganja is offered to the god
and consumed by these classes of the worshippers, but that these
customs are so intimately connected with their worship that they
may be considered to form in some sense an integral part of it.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Trinath.</b> </p>

<p>436. The special form of worship by the followers of Siva,
called the Trinath or Tinnath Mela, in which the use of ganja is
considered to be essential, is mentioned by many witnesses, and
deserves more than a passing notice. A full account of this
religious practice given by Babu Abhilas Chandra Mukharji will be
found in Vol. III Appendices of this Report. The origin of the
rite, which it is said sprang up first in Eastern Bengal, appears
to be of recent date, about the year 1867. It appears to be
observed at all times and at all seasons by Hindus and
Muhammadans alike, the latter calling it Tinlakh Pir. When an
object of special desire is fulfilled, or when a person recovers
from illness, or a son is born, or a marriage or other ceremony
is performed, the god Trinath, representing in one the Hindu
trinity, is worshipped. Originally one pice worth of ganja, one
pice worth of oil, and one pice worth of betel-nut was offered to
the god. But now ganja--it may be in large quantities--is
proffered, and during the incantations and the performance of the
ritual it is incumbent on all present to smoke. This form of
worship is shown to have spread extensively throughout Eastern
Bengal and the Surma Valley of Assam, and, according to one
witness, it has penetrated. even to Orissa. On the other hand,
there are a few witnesses who say that the practice is gradually
dying out. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Muhamadans</b> </p>

<p>437. The use of hemp drugs is as a rule in no way connected
with orthodox Muhammadan observances, whether social or
religious. The Muhammadan religion condemns such practices.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Assam..</b> </p>

<p>438. In Assam, where the use of hemp drugs is but little
practised by the Assamese proper, there appear to be no
indigenous customs connected with the drugs. But the customs
prevailing in Bengal are also found in Assam. There is evidence
as to the use of bhang or siddhi at the Durga Puja, and of ganja
by the worshippers of Siva. In Sylhet the Trinath form of worship
appears to prevail to a considerable extent. With reference to
this practice, one witness (Prasanno Kumar Das) observes that
&quot;in<i> </i>the Surma Valley ganja is offered in the name of
Pit Muhammadan saint) for the benefit of the cattle.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p><b>North-Western Provinces.</b> </p>

<p>439. In the North-Western Provinces, where the celebration of
the Durga Puja is not so generally observed as in Bengal, a
con-siderable number of witnesses (some fifty in all) state that
there are no customs, religious or social, with which these drugs
are connected. But, on the other hand, there is overwhelming
evidence to establish the almost universal use by the people of
bhang at the Holi festival, and some evidence as to the common
use of ganja by certain classes of the followers of Siva at their
festivals and seasons of worship. Of the witnesses who speak to
the use of ganja in connection with religious observances, 22
state that it is essential and 92 that it is not essential. As to
whether the use of bhang should be regarded as a purely social
custom or as essential to religious observance,. the opinion of
witnesses who speak on the point is about equally divided. It is
sufficient to say that the custom is now a general one, and that
where the Holi festival is observed, there the practice of
consuming bhang during its observance is common. On other
occasions, such as the Diwali festival, marriages, and family
festivities, there is evidence to show that among certain classes
the consumption of bhang is common. Allusion is also frequently
made to the habit of using bhang, to which, for example, the
Chaubes of Mathra and Brindaban are notoriously addicted, but how
far the habit is connected with the religious observances at the
temples the evidence does not justify the formation of an
opinion. A custom is mentioned by, a Kumaon witness, Dharma Nand
Joshi, who states that a class of people called Ko<i>uls, </i>who
worship spirits, meat, fish, etc., have the bhang plant as one of
the objects of their worship.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Punnjab</b> </p>

<p>440. In the Punjab there is evidence as to the general use of
hemp by some of the followers of Siva, and especially of bhang,
at the Holi, Dasehra, Diwali, and other festivals, and on the
occasion o marriages and other family festivities. Among the
Sikhs the use of bhang as a beverage appears to be common, and to
be associated with their religious practices. The witnesses who
refer to this use by the Sikhs appear to regard it as an
essential part of their religious rites having the authority of
the Granth or Sikh scripture. Witness Sodhi Iswar Singh, Extra
Assistant Commissioner, says :&quot;As far as I know, bhang is
pounded by the Sikhs on the Dasehra day, and it is ordinarily
binding upon every Sikh to drink it as a sacred draught by mixing
water with it. <i>Legend--</i>Guru<i> </i>Gobind Singh, the tenth
guru, the founder of the Sikh religion, was on the gaddi of Baba
Nanak in the time of Emperor Aurangzeb. When the guru was at
Anandpur, tahsil Una, Hoshiarpur district, engaged in battle with
the Hill Rajas of the Simla, Kangra, and the Hoshiarpur
districts, the Rains sent an elephant, who was trained in
attacking and slaying the forces of the enemy with a sword in his
trunk and in breaking open the gates of forts, to attack and
capture the Lohgarh fort near Anandpur. The guru gave one of his
followers, Bachittar Singh, some bhang and a little of opium to
eat, and directed him to face the said elephant. This brave man
obeyed the word of command of his leader and attacked the
elephant, who was intoxicated and had achieved victories in
several battles before, with the result that the animal was
overpowered and the Hill Rajas defeated. The use of bhang,
therefore, on the Dasehra day is necessary as a sacred draught.
It is customary among the Sikhs generally to drink bhang, so that
Guru Gobind Singh has himself said the following poems in praise
of bhang: &quot;Give me, O Saki (butler), a cup of green colour
(bhang), as it is required by me at the time of battle (vide
'Suraj Parkash,' the Sikh religious book). &quot;Bhang is also
used on the Chandas day, which is a festival of the god Sheoji
Mahadeva. The Sikhs consider it binding to use it on the Dasehra
day-The quantity then taken is too small to prove
injurious.&quot; As Sikhs are absolutely prohibited by their
religion from smoking, the use of ganja and charas in this form
is not practised by them. of old Sikh times, is annually
permitted to collect without interference a boat load of bhang,
which is afterwards. distributed throughout the year to the
sadhus and beggars who are supported by the dharamsala. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Central Provinces.</b> </p>

<p>441. The evidence as to social or religious customs in the
Central Provinces is somewhat discrepant, but on the whole points
to the existence of customs akin to those existing in the
North-Western Provinces. The use of bhang at the Holi and Diwali
festivals and at marriages and such occasions, and of ganja or
bhang in connection with. the worship of Siva, is frequently
mentioned by the witnesses. A few local customs are also
mentioned by some witnesses. Regarding a custom of the Chamar
caste, the Rev. Mr. Jacob says: &quot;At Chanda; the Chamars use
ganja dust in the preparation of a beverage called <i>gulabpani, </i>which
is drunk at a ceremony called <i>dadhi </i>(the first shaving of
the beard), when no liquor is permitted.&quot; Among the Gonds,
Cowasjee Nusserwanjee Hattidaru describes the following custom as
existing:.&quot; In the funeral ceremony amongst the Gonds of
these provinces, <i>kalli </i>or flat ganja is placed over the
chest of the dead body of the Gond, and when the funeral party
returns home, a little of the ganja is burnt in the house of the
dead person, the smoke of which is supposed to reach the spirit
of the dead.&quot; Another Satpura witness, Hosen Khan, mentions
a custom of offering &quot;a<i> </i>little ganja at the Chitarai
Debis, or collections of stones with rags tied to some tree
above. They offer either a cock or a cocoanut or some ganja. It
is a custom among travellers. These Chitarai Debis are in the
open, and the travellers have a smoke at the same time.&quot; One
witness states that he has heard of the hemp plant being
worshipped in the Berars, but this is not corroborated by any of
the witnesses from these districts. Another has heard that the
Gonds in their hill homes are worshippers of the plant<br>
</p>

<p><b>Madras.</b> </p>

<p>442. In the Madras Presidency, where the use of hemp drugs is
less common than in most other provinces, many witnesses assert
that there are no customs, social or religious, with which they
are connected, and the evidence as a whole fails to establish the
prevalence of any customs so general as those connected with the
Durga Puja and the worship of Siva in Bengal or the Holi festival
in the North-Western Provinces. But there is evidence as to the
existence of customs of a less general or widespread nature. In
Ganjam, the witnesses speak to the common use bhang on the <i>Mesha
Sankranti </i>day in honour of Siva and Anjanayya, and also in
the worship of Durga. Several also allude to a custom of offering
a confection or draught containing bhang to the image at the
temples of Hanuman. At the festival of Kama, the Indian cupid,
bhang is freely made and drunk according to several witnesses.
The Rajputs or Bondilis are particularly referred to in
connection with this custom. On occasions of holidays or
gala-days, and at the Mohurram, a number of witnesses say it is
usual for Muhammadans as well as Hindus to take bhang. It is also
said that various intoxicants, including ganja, are sometimes
offered to the gods in worship, and then swallowed by those
offering them. Witness M. Sundaram Iyer, Deputy Tahsildar (60),
says: &quot;Some<i> </i>of the lower orders make use of ganja as
an offering, like cocoa-nut, plantains, liquor, and such other
articles, for certain deities, such as Mathura--veeran,
Muniappan, etc., according to the vow taken by each person. This
cannot be considered as essential, but is only a practice
observed in very rare cases. Such practice is not followed by
many people, and it is not injurious. &quot;Others allude to the
offering of ganja to Karuppannam, Kali, Mathuraveeran, Muniappan,
Karuannaswami, and Aiyaswami, more particularly in the south of
the Presidency. Mr. Azizuddin, Sahib Bahadur, Deputy Collector,
says: &quot;Neither<i> </i>the Musalman nor the Hindu religion
requires the use of these drugs on religious occasions. On the
other hand, it is prohibited. Nevertheless, in the <i>maths </i>of
bairagis, such as at Tripati, and of Muhammadan saints, such as
at Nagore Conjeveram, Arcot, and other places, the manager of the
shrine distributes ganja to all the fakirs who assemble during
the festival. In none of these places, religiously speaking,
ganja should be distributed, but, according to custom among the
fakirs, its distribution is essential.&quot; The Rev. Mr.
Campbell says that ganja is used in connection with the funeral
ceremonies observed by certain classes, but that the use is not
essential. Mr. Merriman alludes to a custom of offering and
consuming bhang at the funeral of bhang consumers.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Bombay</b> </p>

<p>443. An interesting note, entitled &quot;The Religion of
Hemp,&quot; by Mr. J. M. Campbell, C.I.E., will be found in Vol.
III Appendices. In the Bombay presidency the use of hemp in
connection with the worship of Siva, Mahadev or Shankar appears
to be very common. It is referred to by many witnesses. The
following description of this custom as prevailing in part of
Gujarat, Kaira, and probably Ahmedabad has been furnished to the
Excise Commissioner by Mr. B. E. Modi, Deputy Collector: &quot;On<i>
</i>the Shivratri day (the last day but one of the month of
Magh), sacred to the god Mahadev or Shankar, bhang water is
freely poured over the <i>lingam. </i>Mahadev is an ascetic, and
is fond of bhang, and on this day it is considered a religious
duty to offer him his favourite drink. From this day to the 11th
day of Ashad, on which day gods go to sleep, water is kept
constantly dripping upon the <i>lingam </i>of Mahadev from an
earthen pot kept above it. &quot;Somewhat similar accounts
varying in detail are given by many witnesses coming from
different parts of the province, of whom some also refer to the
habit which ganja smokers have of invoking the deity before
placing the pipe. to their lips. Others also refer to hemp as
required in the worship of Baldeo and to its use at the Shimga or
Holi festival. The Marwaris and some other classes appear to use
bhang at marriages and other festivities. Mr. Charles, Collector
of Belgaum, says that among Musalmans and Marathas the ganja
plant is offered to dead relatives who used it in their lifetime
at the time of the anniversary ceremonies of their death. There
appears to be no special custom of worshipping the hemp plant
itself. R. K. Kothavale, of Satara district, says the hemp plant
is worshipped, by one sect only, namely, by people from Northern
India and Nepal, while Mr. Lamb, Collector of Alibag, remarks
that some of the Kunbis who make Offerings to the local
divinities of their fields at the harvest season include a. small
quantity of ganja in the offerings.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Sind.</b> </p>

<p>444. In Sind the customs, both religious and' social, appear
to be much the same as in Bombay. In Karachi and some other
places bhang is generally offered to all comers on occasions of
marriages, panchayats, and other gatherings; and the custom of
freely distributing bhang as a charity to all who dare to partake
is common both at temples and at other places of resort.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Berar.</b> </p>

<p>445. In Berar there is evidence as to the use both of ganja
and bhang at the Shivratri and Holi festivals and at social
gatherings. The hemp plant itself is not worshipped, but,
according to one witness, when a consumer dies, the plant is kept
near his corpse during the funeral ceremony. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Ajmere-Merwara.</b> </p>

<p>446. At the Holi and the Shivratri and at family festivities
the drugs, especially bhang, are used. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Baluchistan.</b> </p>

<p>447. Major Gaisford, Deputy Commissioner, states that among
the Hindu sect called Barn Bargis the consumption of bhang is
regarded as essential.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Native States.</b> </p>

<p>448. From Native States there is but little information
regarding customs, either social or religious, with which these
drugs are connected. No purely local or indigenous customs have
been brought to the notice of the Commission, but there is
sufficient information to show that practices similar to those
existing in British provinces at the Holi and Shrivratri
festivals and on occasions of family rejoicings are observed by
certain classes of the people in many Native States.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Worship of the hemp plant</b> </p>

<p>449. The custom of worshipping the hemp plant, although not so
prevalent as that of offering hemp to Siva and other deities of
the Hindus, would nevertheless appear from the statements of the
witnesses to exist to some extent in some provinces of India. The
reason why this fact is not generally known may perhaps be
gathered from such statements as that of Pandit Dharma Nand
Joshi, who says that such worship is performed in secret. There
may be another cause of the denial on the part of the large
majority of Hindu witnesses of any knowledge of the existence of
a custom of worshipping the hemp plant in that the educated Hindu
will not admit that he worships the material object of his
adoration, but the deity as represented by it. The custom of
worshipping the hemp plant, though not confined to the Himalayan
districts or the northern portions of India alone, where the use
of the products of the hemp plant is more general among the
people, is less known as we go south. Still even far south, in
some of the hilly districts of the Madras Presidency and among
the rural population, the hemp plant is looked upon with some
sort of veneration. Mr. J. H. Merriman (witness No. 28, Madras)
says: <i>&quot;I </i>know of no custom of worshipping the hemp
plant, but believe it is held in a certain sort of veneration by
some classes.&quot; Mr. J. Sturrock, the Collector of Coimbatore
(witness No. 2, Madras), says: &quot;In some few localities there
is a tradition of sanctity attached to the plant, but no regular
worship. &quot;The Chairman of the Conjeveram Municipal Board,
Mr. E. Subramana Iyer (witness No. 143, Madras) says: &quot;There
is no plant to be worshipped here, but it is generally used as
sacrifices to some of the minor Hindu deities. &quot;There is a
passage quoted from <i>Rudrayanmal Danakand and Karmakaud </i>in
the report on the use of hemp drugs in the Baroda State, which
also shows that the worship of the bhang plant is enjoined in the
<i>Shastras. </i>It is thus stated: &quot;The god Shiva says to
Parvati-- 'Oh,<i> </i>goddess Parvati, hear the benefits derived
from bhang. The worship of bhang raises one to my position. In <i>Bhabishya
Puran </i>it is stated that &quot;on the 13th moon of Chaitra
(March and April) one who wishes to see the number of his sons
and grandsons increased must worship <i>Kama </i>(Cupid) in the
hemp plant, etc.&quot;.<br>
</p>

<p><b>General conclusions</b> </p>

<ol>
    <li>In summing up their conclusions on this chapter, the
        Commission would first remark that charas, which is a
        comparatively new article of consumption, has not been
        shown to be in any way connected with religious
        observance. As regards Northern India, the Commission are
        of opinion that the use of bhang is more or less common
        everywhere in connection with the social and religious
        customs of the people As regards ganja they find that
        there are certain classes in all parts, except the
        Punjab, who use the drug in connection with their social
        and religious observances. The Commission are also of
        opinion in regard to bhang that its use is considered
        essential in some religious observances by a large
        section of the community, and in regard to ganja that
        those who consider it essential are comparatively very
        few. The Commission have little doubt that interference
        with the use of hemp in connection with the customs and
        observances above referred to would be regarded by the
        consumers as an interference with long established usage
        and as an encroachment upon their religious liberty. And
        this feeling would, especially in the case of bhang,
        undoubtedly be shared to some extent by the people at
        large. Regarding Southern India, the same remarks apply
        with this reservation, that. the difference between ganja
        and bhang as materials for smoking and drinking
        respectively is much less marked there, and the
        distinction between the two forms of the drug is much
        less clearly recognised, although by the term<i> </i>&quot;bhang&quot;
        is generally meant the drug as used for drinking, and by
        &quot;ganja&quot;<i> </i>the drug as used for smoking. </li>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This monumental study exposes the overriding and pervasive
powers of contemporary collective denial and moral failure
underpinning policies of cannabis prohibition. Motivated by
convenient moralism, questions are repeatedly disingenuously
raised concerning the harm of hemp drugs, cannabis, or marijuana.
The engine of agitprop bureaucratic ire fires up. Hearings are
scheduled, witnesses heard, proceedings transcribed, summarized,
presented to the requesting organization, discussed, filed, and
forgotten. The prohibition policies go on. Enforcement,
corrections systems strain under the demands of majoritarian
magical beliefs in coercive powers of Government; promoted by
continuing self-serving Government misinformation and censorship.
From the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission's policy perspective,
today's drug polices would be unthinkable. <br>
</p>

<p>In the century since the resolution passed the British House
of Commons setting up the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission that
resulted in this massive inquiry documented in a nine volume
report there have been drastic changes in public policy in the
United States and Great Britain.<br>
</p>

<p>The Indian hemp drug regulation policies were explicitly
predicated upon optimal and minimal government intervention.<br>
</p>

<p>The subsequent century in the United States, Great Britain,
and Europe has seen pandemic spread of prohibitionist
authoritarian Government interference- the American Disease-
social experiment run amok. <br>
</p>

<p>Income taxes, mass conscription, and two world wars have seen
regression from utilitarian governance of enlightened
non-interference to intrusive majoritarian autocracy.
Authoritative Government has become authoritarian. Less and less
Government justification and demonstrated necessity are needed.
The principle of non-interference is virtually inoperative. The
space of human existence where a person reigns uncontrolled
contracts even further. The large departments of individualistic
human life are contracted or eliminated by laws, public and
corporate policy. <br>
</p>

<p>The second intervention by Government; giving advice and
promulgating information has seen a parallel degradation. From
legitimate and trustworthy dissemination of factual information
through the institutions of science and medicine to censorship,
giving bad advice, dissimulation and deception in the service of
coercion and manipulation. The ensuing chaos of ignorance,
partial truths, and outright lies has produced a cacophonous
toxic confusion surrounding the use of hemp drugs. The font of
contemporary knowledge is now a stinking swamp, hopelessly
poisoned by the ignorant fantasies, fears, and untruths resulting
from prohibitionists' drug propaganda efforts. <br>
</p>

<p>Fifty years after the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report in
America the New York Mayor's Committee on Marihuana reported on
use of the drug after a five year study, seven years after
national marijuana prohibition. The perspective was based on the
premise that departments of human life and individual circle with
uncontrolled reign did not include the right to use marihuana.
The authoritative Government intervention of Prohibition is now
accepted; the non-interference principle of the Millsean Indian
Hemp Drugs Administration policy; dead- a luxury enjoyed,
ironically, by people of India subjugated by the British
imperium.<br>
</p>

<p>Descriptions of marihuana use were now from the perspective of
studying the characteristics of the users of this illicit drug:
to what extent, method of distribution, attitude of smoker toward
society and use of the drug, relationship with eroticism, crime,
and juvenile delinquency. Discussions of legitimacy of Government
intervention are by implication discussing the relative
dangerousness of marihuana. The legitimacy of Prohibition as a
social policy was neither justified nor discussed. Religious use
or freedom is not mentioned.<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;I am glad that the sociological, psychological, and
medical ills commonly attributed to marihuana have been found to
be exaggerated insofar as the City of New York is concerned. I
hasten to point out, however, that the findings are to be
interpreted only as a reassuring report of progress and not as
encouragement to indulgence, for I shall continue to enforce the
laws prohibiting the use of marihuana until and if complete
findings may justify an amendment to existing laws.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>In the 1970 revision in Government marihuana prohibition
policy generated another report in 1972: Marihuana: a Signal of
Misunderstanding- First Report of the National Commission on
Marihuana and Drug Abuse. <br>
</p>

<p>Individual rights are at least discussed in order to be
heavily discounted:<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;So, while we agree with the basic philosophical precept
that society may interfere with individual conduct only in the
public interest, using coercive measures only when less
restrictive measures would not suffice, this principle merely
initiates inquiry into a rational social policy but does not
identify it. We must take a careful look at this complicated
question of the social impact of private behavior. And we must
recognize at the outset the inherent difficulty in predicting
effects on the public health and welfare, and the strong
conflicting notions of what constitutes the public
interest.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;Religious freedom&quot; as currently delineated by the
Government places the burden on the individual to pass certain
&quot;tests&quot; to prove that hemp drugs used for sacramental
purposes:<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;Cases dealing with religious freedom in other contexts
have isolated three distinct foci of inquiry when a law is
challenged as violative of the &quot;free exercise&quot; clause:
(1) Is the claimant's belief and practice really a
&quot;religion&quot; within the meaning of the First Amendment?
(2) If so, is the practice prohibited by the challenged statute
essential to the practice of the &quot;religion?&quot; (3) Even
if the answers to (1) and (2) are yes, is there nevertheless a
sufficiently compelling state interest to warrant overriding the
practice? Only when the proscribed activity is essential to a
qualified &quot;religion&quot; and the state's interest is not
overwhelming will the courts invoke the First Amendment to
invalidate an otherwise permissible legislative
proscription.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>In the 1989 Carl Olsen, a white Rastafarian and director of
Iowa NORML unsuccessfully attempted a religious freedom defense
for charges of marijuana selling and importation for distribution
to other members of the Ethiopian Coptic Zion Church.<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;If the 'compelling interest' test is to be applied...it
must be applied across the board, to all actions thought to be
religiously commanded... Any society adopting such a system would
be courting anarchy.... The rule respondents favor would open the
prospect of constitutionally required religious exemptions from
civic obligations of almost every conceivable kind- ranging from
compulsory military service....to the payment of taxes.....drug
laws.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>Dutifully crafted by Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg, now on the
supreme court, no question of how authoritative interference of
Government is accepted to be appropriate public policy. Religious
freedom is now restricted to activity that must be asserted and
proven rather than assumed. Proving compelling interest has
switched from the Government to the individual.<br>
</p>

<p>Departments of human life were seen not to be imperiously
guarded for the individual but regarded with mistrust and source
of opportunities for dissent against public policy. At the height
of the Vietnam war marijuana use was strongly identified with the
growing student antiwar resistance.<br>
</p>

<p>The non-intervention principle is at least recognized but the
departments of individuality and circle around the individual
were routinely stepped over by Government with justification in
this case for national security. Militarism preempted any
considerations of individual rights of privacy. Departments of
human life were small and confined to cosmetic obligatory
institutional ritual displays in the context of growing public
resistance to the American military industrial behemoth run amok
in southeast Asia.<br>
</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the cautious conclusion of the Commission to
critically examine the policies of marijuana prohibition, the
report was conspicuously rejected sight unseen by then president
Richard M. Nixon to demonstrate his being &quot;tough on
crime&quot; in a presidency struggling to end the Vietnam war. <br>
</p>

<p>Twenty-two years later on the centennial of the Indian Hemp
Drugs Commission Report finds the principle of Government
non-interference is an all but forgotten faded idealistic icon,
given hollow obeisance at state ceremonies, a quaint
philosophical curiosity of the past. The circle around the
individual is reduced to a pale, flaccid, tattered, transparent,
and permeable membrane. Intrusion is limited only by available
funding to Government interference. The worsening of the balance
of power between the individual and state has increased by an
order of magnitude, facilitated by advances in technology. <br>
</p>

<p>Toqueville in his prophetic Democracy in America warns of
dangerous forms of despotism in democratic, egalitarian America: <br>
</p>

<p>&quot;A great many persons of the present day are quite
contented with this sort of compromise between administrative
despotism and the sovereignty of the people; and they think they
have done enough for the protection of individual freedom when
they have surrendered it to the power of the nation at large.
This does not satisfy me: the nature of him I am to obey
signifies less to me than the fact of extorted obedience.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;Thus it every day renders the exercise of the free
agency of man less useful and less frequent; it circumscribes the
will within a narrower range and gradually robs a man of all the
uses of himself. The principle of equality has prepared men for
these things; it has predisposed men to endure them and often to
look upon them as benefits.<br>
</p>

<p>After having thus successively taken each member of the
community in its powerful grasp and fashioned him at will, the
supreme power then extends its arm over the whole community. It
covers the surface of society with a network of small complicated
rules, minute and uniform, through which the most original minds
and most energetic characters cannot penetrate, to rise above the
crowd. The will of the man is not shattered, but softened, bent,
and guided; men are seldom forced by it to act, but they are
constantly restrained from acting. Such a power does not destroy,
but it prevents existence, it does not tyrannize, but it
compresses, enervates, extinguishes, and stupefies a people, till
each nation is reduced to nothing better than a flock of timid
and industrious animals, of which the government is the
shepherd.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>Attacked by oaths of &quot;drug free,&quot; informers
(including children), undercover police, drug-sniffing dogs,
random and warrantless searches, child snatching, drug testing,
forfeiture of property, surveillance of bank, business,
electricity, and other records, the departments of human life
wither. The parts of human life considered reserved territory are
noticeably smaller- the individual, society and
&quot;civilization&quot; suffer the loss.<br>
</p>

<p>Review of the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report is important
for perspective in assessing the legitimacy and direction of
contemporary Government drug policy in a democratic society.
Froude's theorem of functional governance: &quot;no laws are of
any service which are above the working level of public morality,
and evasion.&quot; was of importance to feudal England, the
Indian Hemp Drugs Commission in 1894 and a century later a public
policy issue of prime magnitude. <br>

</u></b></p>

<p><b>NOTE BY MR. J. M. CAMPBELL, C.I.E., COLLECTOR OF LAND
REVENUE AND CUSTOMS AND OPIUM, BOMBAY, ON THE RELIGION OF HEMP. <br>
</b></p>

<hr>

<p>To the Hindu the hemp plant is holy. A guardian lives in the
bhang leaf. As the wife of Vishnu, the preserver, lives in the
hysteria-curing <i>tulsi, </i>or Holy Basil, and as Shiva dwells
in the dysentery-scaring <i>bel, AE</i>gle<i> </i>marmelos, so
the properties of the bhang plant, its power to suppress the
appetites, its virtue as a febrifuge, and its thought-bracing
qualities show that the bhang leaf is the home of the great Yogi
or brooding ascetic Mahadev. </p>

<p>So holy a plant should have special rearing. Shiva explains to
his wife, Parvati, how, in sowing hemp seed, you should keep
repeating the spell 'Bhangi', 'Bhangi', apparently that the sound
of that guardian name may scare the evil tare-sowing influences.
Again, when the seedlings are planted the same holy name must be
repeated, and also at the watering which, for the space of a
year, the young plants must daily receive. When the flowers
appear the flowers and leaves should be stripped from the plant
and kept for a day in warm water. Next day, with one hundred
repetitions of the holy name Bhangi, the leaves and flowers
should be washed in a river and dried in an open shed. When they
are dry some of the leaves should be burnt with due repeating of
the holy name as a <i>jap </i>or muttered charm. Then, bearing in
mind Vagdevata, or the goddess of speech, and offering a prayer,
the dried leaves should be laid in a pure and sanctified place.
Bhang so prepared, especially If prayers are said over it, will
gratify the wishes and desires of its owner. Taken in the early
morning such bhang cleanses the user from sin, frees him from the
punishment of crores of sins, and entitles him to reap the fruits
of a thousand horse-sacrifices. Such sanctified bhang taken at
day break or noon<i> </i>destroys disease. Before the religious
user of bhang stand the Ashtadevata or Eight Guardians with
clasped hands ready to obey him and perform his orders. The wish
of him who with pure mind pours bhang with due reverence over the
Ling of Mahadev will be fulfilled.<br>
</p>

<p>Such holiness and such evil-scaring powers must give bhang a
high place among lucky objects. That a day may be fortunate the
careful man should on waking look into liquid bhang. So any
nightmares or evil spirits that may have entered into him during
the ghost-haunted hours of night will flee from him at the sight
of the bhang and free him from their blinding influences during
the day. So too when a journey has to be begun or a fresh duty or
business undertaken it is well to look at bhang. To meet some one
carrying bhang is a sure omen of success. To see in a dream the
leaves, plant, or water of bhang is lucky; it brings the goddess
of wealth into the dreamer's power. To see his parents worship
the bhang-plant and pour bhang over Shiva's Ling will cure the
dreamer of fever. A longing for bhang foretells happiness: to see
bhang drunk increases riches. No good thing can come to the man
who treads under foot the holy bhang leaf.<br>
</p>

<p>So evil-searing and therefore luck-bringing a plant must play
an important part in the rites required to clear away evil
influences. During the great spirit time of marriage in Bombay
among almost all the higher classes of Gujarat Hindus, of the
Jain as well as of the Brahmanic sects, the supplies sent by the
family of the bride to the bridegroom's party during their seven
days' sojourn includes a supply of bhang. The name of the father
who neglects to send bhang is held in contempt. Again, after the
wedding<i>, </i>when the bride-groom and his friends are
entertained at the house of the bride, richly-spiced bhang is
drunk by the guests. The Gujarat .Musalman bride before and after
marriage drinks a preparation of bhang. Among the Pardeshi or
North Indian Hindus of Bombay bhang is given not only at
weddings, but the Pardeshi who fails to give his visitor bhang is
despised by his caste as mean and miserly. Another great spirit
time during which bhang plays an important part is the time of
war. Before the outbreak of a war and during its progress the
Ling of Mahadev should be bathed with bhang. Its power of driving
panic influences from near the god has gained for bhang the name
of Vijaya, the unbeaten. So a drink of bhang drives from the
fighting Hindu the haunting spirits of fear and weariness. So the
beleaguered Rajput, when nothing is left but to die, after
loosing his hair that the bhang spirit may have free entrance,
drinks the sacramental bhang and rushing on the enemy completes
his <i>juhar </i>or self-sacrifice. It is this quality of
panic-scaring that makes bhang, the Vijaya or Victorious,
specially dear to Mahadev in his character of Tripur, .the slayer
of the demon Tripurasur. As Shiva is fond of <i>bel </i>leaves,
as Vishnu is fond of <i>tulsi </i>leaves, so is Tripuresvar fond
of bhang leaves. He who wishes to obtain his desires must
constantly offer bhang to Tripuresvar. </p>

<p>Bhang the cooler is a febrifuge. Bhang acts on the fever not
directly or physically as an ordinary medicine, but indirectly or
spiritually by soothing the angry influences to whom the heats of
fever are due. According to one account in the Ayurveda, fever is
possession by the hot angry breath of the great gods Brahma,
Vishnu, and Shiva. According to another passage in the Ayurveda,
Shankar or Shiva, enraged by a slight from his father-in-law
Daksha, breathed from his nostrils the eight fevers that wither
mankind. If the fever-stncken performs the Vijaya abhishek, or
bhang-pouring on the Ling of Shankar, the god is pleased, his
breath cools, and the portion of his breath in the body of the
fever-stricken pleased to inflame. The Kashikhanda Purana tells
how at Benares, a Brahman, sore-smitten with fever, dreamed that
he had poured bhang over the self-sprung Ling and was well. On
waking he went to the Ling, worshipped, poured bhang this cure
brings to Benares sufferers from fever which no ordinary medicine
can cure. The sufferers are laid in the temple pour bhang ever
the Ling whose virtue has gained it the name Jvareshwar, the
Fever-Lord. Bombay many people sick of fever vow on recovery to
pour bhang over a Ling. Besides cure for fever bhang has many
medicinal virtues. It cools the heated blood, soothes the
over-wakeful to sleep, gives beauty,<i> </i>and secures length of
days. It cures dysentery and sunstroke, clears phlegm, quickens
digestion, sharpens appetite, makes the tonic of the lisper
plain, freshens the intellect, and gives alertness to the body
and gaiety to the mind. Such are the useful and needful ends for
which in<i> </i>his goodness the Almighty made bhang. In this
praise of the hemp the Makhzan or great Greek-Arab work on drugs
joins... Ganja in excess uses abscess, even madness. In
moderation bhang is the best of gifts. Bhang is a cordial, a bile
absorber, an appetizer, a prolonger of life. Bhang quickens
fancy, deepens thought, and Judgment. As on other
guardian-assessed objects, the cow, the Vedas, or the leaf oaths
are taken on the bhang leaf Even to a truthful witness an<i> </i>oath
on of the be1 tree, dreaded. To one who forswears himself the
bhang oath is death the bhang leaf. So holy a plant must play a
leading part in temple rights. Shiva on fire with the poison
churned from the ocean was cooled by bhang. At another time
enraged with family worries the fields. The cool shade .of a
plant soothed him. He crushed and of the leaves, and the bhang
refreshed him. For these two benefits bhang is Shankarpri , the
Mahadev. So the right user of bhang or of ganja, before beginning
to drinker smoke, offers the drug to Mahadev saying, lena
Shankar, lena Babulnath: be pleased to take Shankar, take it
Babulnath. According to the Shiva Parann, from the dark
fourteenth of Magh (January-February) to the light fourteenth of
Asbadh (June-July), that is, during the three months of the hot
weather, bhang should be daily poured over the Ling of Shiva
every day, bhang should be poured at least during the first and
last days of this period. According to the Meru Tantra on any
Monday, especially on Shravan (July-August) Mondays, on all
twelfths <i>pradoshs, </i>and on all dark fourteenths or <i>shivratris</i>
still more on the Mahashivratri or Shiva's Great Night on dark
fourteenth of Magh (January-February.), and at all eclipses of
the sun or moon, persons wistful either for this world or for the
world to come should offer bhang to Shiva and pour it over the
Ling. Not every devotee of Shiva makes offerings of bhang. Such
rites in Bombay are seldom performed except in the Bhuleswar and
Babulnath temples and there only on special occasions. The bhang
offered to Mahadev is without pepper or other spice. It is mixed
with water, water and milk, or milk and sugar. It is poured over
the Ling. According to some authorities the offerer should not
touch the offered bhang. Temple ministrants Atits, Tapodhans,
Bhojaks, Bhopis, Bharadis, Gutaras alone should drink it. If
there are no ministrants the remains of the offering should be
poured into a well or given to cows to drink. Other authorities
encourage the offerer to the bhang, since by<i> </i>sipping the
bhang reaches and soothes the Shiva-Shakti or Shiva-spirit in the
sipper. On certain social occasions during failures of rain,
during eclipses, and also in times of war libations of bhang are
poured ever the Ling. </p>

<p>Vaishnavas as well as Shaivas make offerings of bhang. The
form of Vishnu Or, the Guardian to whom bhang is a welcome
offering is Baladev, Bainram, or Dauji, the elder brother
Krishna. Baladev was fond of spirits, not of bhang. But Banins,
Bhatias, and other high class Hindus, not being able to offer
spirits instead of spirits the offering of bhang to Baladev,
unlike the special offerings to Shiva, present bhang. In Bombay,
without an offering of bhang no worship of Baladev is complete,
offerings to Shiva is a common and everyday rite. Unlike the
plain or milk and sugared bhang spilt over the Ling, Baladev's
bhang is a richly-spiced liquid which all present, including the
offerer, join in drinking. Such social and religious ions
drinking of bhang is common in Bombay in the temple of Dauji in
Kalyan' Kirparam lane near Bhuleshwar. As in the higher class
worship of Baladev the liquor offering has been refined into an<i>
</i>offering of bhang so it is in the worship of Devi, Shiva's
early and terrible consort. On any Tuesday or Friday, the two
week-days sacred to Devi, still more during the Navrata or Nine
Nights in Ashwin or September-October, those whose caste rules
forbid liquor make a pleasing spices bhang. And as in, the
worship of Baladev all present, worshipper and ,ministrant alike,
join in drinking. Shitaladevi, the Cooler, the dread goddess of
small-pox, whose nature, like the nature of bhang, is cooling,
takes pleasure in offerings of bhang. During epidemics of
small-pox the burning and fever of the disease are soothed by
pouring bhang over the image of Shitaladevi. So for the
feverishness caused by the heats especially to the old no cure
equals the drinking of bhang. Unlike<i> </i>spirits the tempter
to flesh bhang the craver for milk is pleasing to the Hindu
religion. Even according to the staitest school of the objectors
to stimulants, while to a high caste Hindu the penalty for
liquor-drinking is death, no penalty attaches to the use of
bhang, and a single day's fast is enough to cleanse from the
coarser spirit of ganja. Even among those who hold stimulants to
be devil-possessed penalty and disfavor attach to the use of hemp
drugs only when they are taken with no religious object and
without observing the due religious rites. </p>

<p>At the other extreme of Hindu thought from the foes to
stimulants, to the worshippers of the influences that, raising
man out of himself and above mean individual worries, make him
one with the divine force of nature, it is inevitable that
temperaments should be found to whom the quickening spirit of
bhang is the spirit of freedom and knowledge. In the ecstasy of
bhang the spark of the Eternal in man turns into light the
murkiness of matter or illusionand self is lost in the central
soul-fire. The Hindu poet of Shiva, the Great Spirit that living
in bhang passes into the drinker, sings of bhang as the clearer
of ignorance, the giver of'knowledge. No gem or jewel can touch
in value bhang taken truly and reverently. He who drinks bhang
drinks Shiva. The soul in whom the spirit of bhang finds a home
glides intothe ocean of Being freed from the weary round of
matter-blinded self. To the meaner man, still under the glamour
of matter or maya, bhang taken religiously is kindly thwarting
the wiles of his foes and giving the drinker wealth and
promptness of mind. In this devotion to bhang, with reverence,
not with the worship, which is due to Allahalone, the North
Indian Mussulman joins hymning the praises of bhang. To the
follower of the later religion of Islam the holy spirit in bhang
is<i> not </i>the spirit of the Almighty. Itthe spirit of the
great prophet Khizr or Elijah. That bhang should be sacred to
Khizr isnatural. Khizr is the patron saint of water. Still more
Khizr means green, the revered colour of the cooling water of
bhang. So the Urdu poet sings 'When I quaff fresh bhang I liken
its colony to the fresh light down of thy youthful beard.' The
prophet Khizr or the Green prophet cries ' May the drink be
pleasing to thee.' Nasir, the great North Indian Urdupoet of the
beginning of the present century, is loud in the praises of his
beloved Sabzi, the Green one. 'Compared with bhang spirits are
naught. Leave all things thou fool, drink bhang.' From its
quickening the imagination Musalman poets honour bhang with the
title <i>Warak al Khiyall, Fancy's </i>Leaf. And the Makhzan or
great Arab-Greek drug book records many other fond names for the
drug. Bhang is the Joy-giver, the Sky-flier, the Heavenly-guide,
the Poor Man's Heaven, the Soother of Grief. </p>

<p>Much of the holiness of bhang is due to its virtue of clearing
the head and stimulating the brain to thought. Among ascetics the
sect known as Atits are specially devoted to hemp. No social or
religious gathering of Atits is complete without the use of the
hemp plant. </p>

<p>smoked in ganja or drunk in bhang. To its devotee bhang is no
ordinary plant that became , holy from its guardian and healing
qualities. According to one account, when nectar was produced
from the churning of the ocean, something was wanted to purify
the nectar. The deity supplied the want of a nectar-cleanser by
creating bhang. This bhang Mahadev made from his own body, and so
it is called <i>angaj </i>or body-born. According to another
accountsome nectar dropped to the ground and from the ground the
bhang plant sprang. It was because they used this child of nectar
or of Mahadev in agreement with religious forms that thee seers
or Hishis became Siddha or one with the deity. He who, despite
the example of the Hishis, uses no bhang shall lose his happiness
in this life and in the life to come. In the end he shall be cast
into hell. The mere sight of bhang, cleanses from as much sin as
a thousand horse-sacrifices or a thousand pilgrimages. He who
scandalizes the user of bhang shall suffer the torments of hell
so long as the sun endures. He who drinks bhang foolishly or for
pleasure without religious rites is as guilty as the sinner of <i>lakhs
</i>of sins. He who drinks wisely and according to rule, be he
ever so low, even though his body is smeared with human ordure
and urine, is Shiva. No god or man is as good as the religious
drinker of bhang. The students of the scriptures at Benares are
given bhang before they sit to study. At Benares, Ujjain, and
other holy places yogis, bairagis and sanyasis take deep draughts
of bhang that they may Centre their thoughts on the Eternal. To
bring back to reason an unhinged mind the best and cleanest bhang
leaves should be boiled in milk and turned to clarified butter.
Salamisri, saffron, and sugar should be added and the whole
eaten. Besides over the demon of Madness bhang is Vijaya or
victorious over the demons of hunger and thirst. <i>By </i>the
help of bhang ascetics pass days without food or drink. The
supporting power of bhang has brought many a Hindu family safe
through. the miseries of famine. To forbid or even seriously to
restrict the use of so holy and gracious a herb as the hemp would
cause widespread suffering and annoyance and to the large bands
of worshipped ascetics deep-seated anger. It would rob the people
of a solace in discomfort, of a cure in sickness, of a guardian
whose gracious protection saves them from the attacks of evil
influences, and whose mighty power makes the devotee of the
Victorious, overcoming the demons of hunger and thirst, of panic
fear, of the glamour of Maya or matter, and of madness, able in
rest to brood on the Eternal, till the Eternal, possessing him
body and soul, frees him from the having of self and receives him
into the ocean of Being. These beliefs the Musalman devotee
shares to the full. Like his Hindu brother the Musalman fakir
reveres bhang as the lengthener of life, the freer from the bonds
of self. Bhang brings union with the Divine Spirit. 'We drank
bhang and the mystery I am He grew plain. So grand a result, so
tiny a sin.''<br>

</p>

<p>NOTE BY BABU ABHIILAS CHANDRA MUKERJI, SECOND INSPECTOR OF
EXCISE, BENGAL, ON THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF TRINATH WORSHIP IN
EASTERN BENGAL,. '<br>
</p>

<p><i>Date of origin.--In </i>1867 Babu Annnda Chandra Kali or
Kailai, of Dhamrai, a village in thana Sabhar of the Dacca
district, first started the worship at the house of his
father-in- law at Fattehpur in the Atia pargana of the Mymensingh
district (sub-division Tangail). <i>Antecedent: of the
originator.--Dhamrai </i>is an important village in the Dacca
district for its car festival, which is annually held in honour
of a local idol named <i>Madhab Thakur, </i>and which is
witnessed by a large gathering of people. Ananda Chandra received
education at the Dacca Normal School. After leaving school he
served for some time as a pundit (schoolmaster), and then entered
the Police Department, but was there only a short time. He is a
Barendra Brahman and belongs to a respectable family. He learnt
to smoke ganja when he was only a boy. His present age Is 60
years. He has the reputation of being a versifier. He smokes two
pice worth of ganja every day. </p>

<p>He married at Fattehpur in the Mymensingh district. There he
introduced Trinath worship 27 years ago. A <i>panchali </i>(poem)
reciting the praises and exploits of Trinath was first published
at Dacca in 1871 and the first edition (l,000 copies) was sold in
a few months. </p>

<p><i>The circumstances under which the worship was first
started.-Ananda </i>Chandra Kali was at the time living in the
house of his father-in-law. He was thinking of introducing the
worship of a common god, who might be worshipped by all classes,
rich and poor, Brahman and Chandal, and by all creeds, Saktas,
Baishnavas, and Shaivas, and the idea occurred to him of having
the present worship at which ordinary and inexpensive things,
such as ganja, oil, and betel-leaf, were alone to be used.  <br>
</p>

<p>Trinath (from Sanskrit <i>Tri, </i>three, and Nath, lord) is
represented to be Brahma, Bishnu and Shiva, the Hindu Trinity in
one. </p>

<p>Being a ganja-smoker himself Ananda Kali may have also thought
that by introducing the worship he would be able to save the
ganja-smokers from disrepute, as then ganja could be consumed in
the name of a god and under colour of doing a religious or pious
act. </p>

<p><i>Religious aspect of the worship.--The </i>following
translation of the Introduction to the <i>Trinath Mela </i>Panchali
gives some idea of the subject : </p>

<p>The universe consists of the earth, the heaven, and the nether
world, and Trinath is the lord of these three worlds.<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;There was an incarnation of God in the form of Gour
(Chaitanya), who delivered the sinners by preaching the name of
Hari, but the Lord was not satisfied with this, and became
concerned for the created, and soon he became incarnate again.
Brahma, Bishnu and Shiva, gods in three forms, manifested
themselves in one form. The one God, the Lord of the. universe,
seeing the miseries of mankind, came to their deliverance. Ananda
(Ananda Chandra Kali, the originator)declares that the true and
sincere worshippers of Trinath are sure to obtain salvation.
Brahma, Bishnu, and Shiva met together and expressed their
desire, </p>

<p>to come to this world in one form to receive worship. . </p>

<p>&quot;He is a truly pious man who worships Trinath, and
blessings are showered on the worshipper. </p>

<p><i>&quot;The </i>worship should be made in a form in which the
rich and the poor may equally join and may perform it easily. </p>

<p><i>&quot;Only </i>three things, each worth one pice, are
required for this <i>puja </i>(form of worship).. </p>

<p>The things which please all must be selected. The offering
should consist of <i>siddhi </i>(ganja),. <i>pan </i>(betel-leaf),
and oil, each worth one pice. . </p>

<p>&quot;The votaries should assemble at night and worship with
flowers. The ganja should be washed in the manner in which people
wash ganja for smoking. The worshipper must fill three <i>chillums
</i>with equal quantities of ganja, observing due awe and
reverence. When all, the worshippers are assembled the lamp
should be lit with three wicks, and the praises of Tri- should be
sung. As long as the wicks burn, the god should be worshipped and
his praises chanted. The god should be reverentially bowed to at
the close of the puja. When the reading of the <i>Panchali </i>is
finished, those that will not show respect to the <i>Prasad (the<br>
</i>offering which has been accepted by the god), i.e., chillum
of ganja, shall be consigned to. </p>

<p>eternal hell, and the sincere worshippers shall go to heaven.
, </p>

<p><i>How the worship spread.--Anauda </i>Kali commenced the puja
with the aid of some ganja smokers in the village of Fattehpur. A
large number of people consume ganja in the Dacca and Mymensingh
districts, and the worship soon became popular. In fact it spread
like wild-fire from one village to another among the
ganja-smokers. Those that were not in the habit of consuming
ganja also followed their example. </p>

<p>The following circumstances assisted the spread of the Worship
: </p>

<p>I.--The puja is open to all classes from Brahmans to Chandals
and to the rich and the poor. Caste does not stand in its way,
and it may be performed almost every day and in all seasons.<br>
</p>

<p>II.--The pup is a <i>Manarik Puja </i>(made in pursuance of a
vow on the fulfillment of the object desired).. People have been
led to believe that Trinath possesses the power of .healing the
sick and fulfilling desires, and .that those who. neglect his
worship meet with disgrace, while those who observe it <i>attain </i>success
in life. There are several stories m the Panchali narrated in
illustration of this statement. It is also popularly believed
that in the house where Trinath is worshipped cold: fever and
headache do not appear. </p>

<p>III.--This is a cheap form of worship. The puja can be
performed <i>by </i>even the poorest, only three pies being
required. </p>

<p>IV.--People of the lowest class can mix with those above them
without distinction of caste or creed on the occasion of these
pujas. </p>

<p>V.--Ganja eau be consumed by all in the name of a god, and the
practice cannot be looked down upon, because it is done under
certain forms and religious ceremonies. It is also popularly
believed that those who mock the worshippers of Trinath shall be
ruined and shall be the victims of misfortune. <br>
</p>

<p>The worship prevails not only among the poor, but also among
the well-to-do. The latter often entertain their friends after
the puja. </p>

<p>Women do not take any active part in the worship, but they
often listen to the reading. of the <i>Panchali.</i> </p>

<p>The worship is more or less general in the following districts
:--(1) Dacca, (2) Mymensingh, (3) Faridpur, (4) Backergunge, (5)
Noakhali, (6) Tippers, (7) Chittagong, (8) Bogra, (9) Sylhet, and
(10) Pabna (SerajgaDj side). .,, </p>

<p>The worship is on the decline. It is almost dying out among
the educated </p>

<p>]Jut among the masses it Still exists. </p>

<p>. I have ascertained the above facts from Dr. Chandra Sekhar
Kali (brother of the originator, Ananda Chandra Kali) and many
other respectable persons, and also from personal inquiries in
the Daces, Chittagong and Rajshahi divisions. <br>

<p><font size="5">THE POLICY OF HEMP DRUG ADMINISTRATION<br>
</font></p>

<hr>

<p><b>General principles regarding sumptuary laws and their
application to India.</b> </p>

<p>553. The question of prohibiting the growth of the hemp plant
and the sale of ganja and allied drugs is one which stands in the
to forefront Of the present inquiry. It has been remarked by a
well known historian that &quot;no<i> </i>laws are of any service
which are above the working level of public morality, and the
deeper they are carried down into life, the larger become the
opportunities of evasion. If these words are true as applied to
England under a feudal system, they are much more true in the
present day as applied to British India. The Government of this
country has not grown out of the forces contained within it, but
has been superimposed upon them, and the paternal system of
government which may have been suitable in England during the
sixteenth century, and in, the initial development of some Indian
provinces during the period immediately following their
annexation, becomes purely visionary when public opinion is in
process of formation and the needs of the people are year by year
finding more ready expression. Occasionally, no doubt, the
Legislature in India has anticipated a standard of morality not
universally accepted by the people, as in the case of laws
relating to infanticide or the burning of Hindu widows; but these
measures were passed under an overwhelming sense of the necessity
of correcting popular notions of morality in matters coming well
within the sphere of Government, and in the assurance that in the
course of time they could not fail to secure the assent of all
intelligent members of the community. In the chapter of Mill's
Political Economy which treats of the non-interference principle,
a distinction is made between two kinds of intervention by the
Government-- the one authoritative interference, and the other
giving advice or promulgating information. And the following
remarks are made regarding the former: </p>

<p>&quot;It is evident, even at first sight, that the
authoritative form of Government intervention has a much more
limited sphere of legitimate action than the other. It requires a
much stronger necessity to justify it in any case, while there
are large departments of human life from which it must be
unreservedly and imperiously excluded. Whatever theory we adopt
respecting the foundation of the social union, and under whatever
political institutions we live, there is a circle around every
individual human being which no Government, be it that of one, or
of few, or of the many, ought to be permitted to overstep there
is a part of the life of every person who has come to years of
discretion within which the individuality of that person ought to
reign uncontrolled either by any other individual or by the
public collectively. That there is, or ought to be, some space in
human existence thus entrenched around no one who professes the
smallest regard to human freedom or dignity will call in
question: the point to be determined is where the limit should be
placed; how large a province of human life this reserved
territory should include. I apprehend that it ought to include
all that part which concerns only the life, whether inward or
outward of the individual, and does not affect. the interests of
Others, or affect. them only through the moral influence of
example. With respect to the domain of the inward consciousness,
the thoughts and feelings, and as much of external conduct as is
personal only, involving no consequences, none at least of a
painful or injurious kind, to other people, I hold that it is
allowable in all, and in the more thoughtful and cultivated often
a duty, to assert and promulgate with all the force they are
capable of their opinion of what is good or bad, admirable or
contemptible, but not to compel others to conform to that
opinion, whether the force used is that of extra legal coercion,
or exerts itself by means of the law. Even in those portions of
conduct which do affect the interests of others, the onus of
making out a case always lies on the defenders of legal
prohibitions.<i> </i>It is not merely a constructive or
presumptive injury to others which will justify the interference
of law with individual freedom. To be prevented from what one is
inclined to, or from acting contrary to one's own judgment of
what is desirable, is not only always irksome, but always tends, <i>pro
tanto, </i>to starve the development of some portion of the
bodily or mental faculties, either sensitive or active; and,
unless the conscience of the individual goes freely with the
legal restraint, it partakes, either in a great or in a small
degree, of the degradation of slavery. Scarcely any degree of
utility short of absolute necessity will justify a prohibitory
regulation, unless it can also be made to recommend itself to the
general conscience; unless persons of ordinary good intentions
either believe already, or can be induced to believe, that the
thing prohibited is a thing which they ought not to wish to
do.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p>These remarks have been given at length, because the
Commission believe that they contain a clear exposition of the
principles which should guide them in deciding whether the
prohibition of the hemp drugs should be authoritatively enforced
by Government. <br>
</p>

<p><b>The question of entirely suppressing all intoxicants.</b> </p>

<p>554- Now, a certain number of .persons (among whom may in all
probability,- be reckoned the mover of the question in the, House
of Commons which led to the appointment of the-Indian Hemp Drugs
Commission) deem it to be the duty of the British Government to
suppress the trade in all intoxicants in all the countries under
its sway; and there are no doubt special circumstances<i> </i>in
India which render it less, impossible than in some other
countries to consider even so drastic a policy. These are notably
the general sobriety of its races and the feeling, popular as
well as religious, which prevails against their use among a large
section of the community. Even then no appeal in support of such
a measure can be made to the public morality <font
face="Courier New"><font size="4"><tt>or </tt></font>practice of
civilised nations at large, nor, so far as the Commission are
aware, to any marked success attending the experiment in
particular instances. In the exceptional cases in which the
experiment has been attended with partial success (as in some of
the American States), the reformation of the habit has become an
object of desire to the majority of the people, and the enactment
for promoting Such reformation has presented itself less as a
restrictive force than as an auxiliary agency <br>
</font></p>

<p><b>Not laid before the commission</b> </p>

<p>555. But the Commission are not called upon to pronounce on so
wide an issue. It was not upon the basis of this general
principle that the Secretary of State for India accepted the
proposal made in the House of Commons, nor do the instructions
issued to the Commission by the Government of India cover so wide
a field. The question of prohibiting the production and sale of
the hemp drugs in India has to be considered by the Commission
apart from the general question, and such prohibition must be
justified, if at all, on some more special ground than the mere
fact that they are intoxicants.<br>
</p>

<p><b>The past history of the case how far to be relied upon.</b>
</p>

<p>556. Again, there are a certain number of persons whose'
evidence before the Commission points to the assumption that the
case for prohibition of the hemp drugs has already been
established in the records of the Government, and that further
enquiry implies a willful blindness to what has been abundantly
proved by such records. A reference to Chapter XII of this Report
will show how untrustworthy these records are in regard to the
production of insanity by the use of the drugs-- an aspect of the
question which is of the utmost importance, and has formed the
basis of nearly all the official opinion heretofore recorded.
against such use. And, after availing themselves fully of every
opportunity of consulting the official literature on the subject,
the Commission have arrived at the conclusion that it shows
little originality, and that a very limited amount of personal
observation has been made to do duty as the basis of large
conclusions. The want of reliable data has been compensated by
annual reiteration until the stamp of antiquity has secured for
the opinions so expressed a large amount of acquiescence among
officials who had neither the time nor the opportunity to examine
the matter for themselves So far, therefore, as the effects of
the hemp drugs are concerned, the Commission have had to approach
the subject as almost a <i>tabula rasa, </i>and, while availing
themselves of the imperfect data previously collected, have
endeavoured to avoid accepting any conclusions without a
substantial foundation of well ascertained facts. The attitude,
however, of the Government in regard to the question may be
briefly described. So far back as 1798 an inquiry was made in
Bengal regarding the quality of ten intoxicating articles--
&quot;opium, madak ganja, subzi, bhang, majum, banker, charas,
tobacco, and toddy--&quot; with a view to determining whether it
might not be advisable to prohibit altogether the sale of any of
them. The conclusion arrived at, which was stated in a letter of
the Board to the Governor-General in Council, No. 22, dated 29th
May 1798, was to the following effect. &quot;It appears that the
original productions are as follows: Tobacco, opium, ganja, subzi
or bhang, banker, and toddy, and that the three remaining
articles are for the most part compositions of those here
recited, as above mentioned. With respect to the drugs specified
m the foregoing schedule, they are not for the most part
represented as producing any very violent or dangerous effects of
intoxication except when taken to excess; and, although the
operation of them-may be more powerful in their compound state,
we apprehend it would be difficult to sanction the sale of the
original productions, and to prohibit with effect the use of
compositions of which they are susceptible; to which may be added
that most of these articles, both as original productions and as
artificial combinations appear to be useful either in medicine or
otherwise; for these reasons we do not deem it necessary to
recommend that the sale of any of them be altogether prohibited,
but shall proceed to state what appear to us the. best means of
restraining the use of them, and improving the revenue by the
imposition of such taxes as are best adapted to the nature of the
case.&quot; A complete inquiry was made in 1871 from all
provinces as to the effects of several preparations of hemp; and
if the result should call for any action in the direction of
restricting them by enhancement of the duty or of limiting, or
even prohibiting, the cultivation of the. plant, the advice of
the Local Governments was invited as to the expediency and
practicability of such measures. The result is contained in the
Resolution of the Government of. India, Finance Department, No.
3773, dated 17th December 1873. The following passage shows the
conclusion arrived at: <br>
</p>

<p>&quot;Upon a consideration of all the opinions thus collected,
it does not appear to the Governor-General in Council to be
specially proved that hemp incites to crime more than other drugs
or than spirits. And there is some evidence to show that on rare
occasions this drug, usually so noxious, may be usefully taken.
There can, however, be no doubt that its habitual use does
produce insanity. The total number of cases of insanity is small
in proportion to the population, and not large even in proportion
to the number of ganja smokers; but of the cases of insanity
produced by the excessive use of drugs or spirits, by far the
largest number must be attributed to the abuse of hemp. Lower
Bengal the circumstances have admitted of a system under which
the consumption of ganja has been reduced one-half, while the
amount of duty levied on it has been doubled. It would be very
desirable to control the cultivation and preparation of ganja and
bhang elsewhere-in the same way. But it is believed that this
would not be easy; indeed, it would probably be impracticable.
Moreover, with the exception of the Chief Commissioners of
British Burma and the Central Provinces, the Local Governments
are not in favour of altering existing arrangements. His
Excellency in Council, however, trusts that the various Local
Governments and Administrations will endeavour, wherever it may
be possible, to discourage the consumption of ganja and bhang by
placing restrictions on their cultivation, preparation and
retail, and imposing on their use as high a rate of duty as can
be levied without inducing illicit practices. As regards British
Burma, the Chief Commissioner has already been informed that the
Governor-General in Council concurs with him in thinking that the
cultivation and consumption of ganja should be absolutely
prohibited, and it has been prohibited from the beginning of the
year 1873-74. &quot;<br>
</p>

<p>In 1877 the Bengal Government appointed a special officer,
Babu Hem Chunder Kerr, to make a full inquiry into the details of
the cultivation of ganja, the sufficiency or otherwise of the
present safeguards, and the reforms which it might be advisable
to introduce. Sir Ashley Eden's conclusions on this officer's
report in regard to the effects of ganja and policy to be
followed were as follows: &quot;The Lieutenant-Governor has
himself no doubt that the use of ganja in any form is injurious
to the consumer, and that it is the duty of Government to make
the tax on this article as high as it can possibly bear.
Unfortunately it is habitually used by large numbers of the lower
classes of the population, who would, if deprived of it
altogether, apparently find in the leaves of the wild hemp plant
and in other drugs narcotics and stimulants of equally
deleterious character. It does not seem possible, therefore, to
stop the cultivation altogether. The policy of Government must be
to limit its production and sale by a high rate of duty without
placing the drug entirely beyond the reach of those who will
insist upon having it.&quot; The last important utterance on the
subject previous to the appointment of the Commission is
contained in the letter of the Government of India, Finance
Department, to Her Majesty's Secretary of State, No. 212, dated
9th August 1892, in which the following remarks occur: &quot;We
are inclined to believe that ganja is the most noxious of all
intoxicants now commonly used in India. But even if the absolute
prohibition of the use of the drug could be enforced, the result
might be to induce the use of still more noxious drugs. India
abounds with plants growing wild from which drugs can be procured
which are more deleterious in their effects than ganja. One such<i>
</i>plant is the dhatura <i>(Stramonium), </i>the seeds of which
are already used to intensify the narcotic effects of bhang, a
liquid preparation of hemp leaves; and we apprehend that if the
use of ganja were suppressed altogether, dhatura might be largely
resorted to by the poorer classes as a means of satisfying their
craving for stimulants. Apart, however, from the objections just
mentioned, we believe. that it would be impossible to enforce in
India a prohibition of the use of ganja. That drug is produced in
Native States, and the difficulties in the way of preventing its
import from them, if the supply in British India were cut off,
would be immense. It would not, moreover, be possible to suppress
the supply in British India. The hemp plant grows readily in
India, in many places wild without cultivation of any kind, and
it would be easy for any one addicted to the use of ganja to grow
a plant or two in the enclosure of his own house and in nooks and
corners which would be safe from observation and from the risk of
detection. The question in the House of Commons suggests that as
the possession and sale of ganja has been prohibited for many
years in Burma, it is desirable that the same prohibition should
be extended to other provinces of British India. The analogy of
Burma does not, however, apply to India. When the prohibition was
enforced in Burma, the drug was very little used by the Native
Burmese, its consumption being almost entirely confined to
coolies and other immigrants from India; and the cultivation of
the plant in Burma, which had never been extensive, had virtually
ceased, the consumers being dependent on importations for their
supplies. In India, on the other hand, the practice of ganja
smoking has existed from time immemorial, and among certain sects
of Hindus, ascetics, and religious mendicants hemp intoxication
is habitually indulged in; and, as explained in the preceding
paragraph, it would be impossible to suppress the growth of the
plant. But, although we consider it impracticable to enforce the
absolute prohibition of the use of ganja, we fully recognise it
as our duty to restrict its consumption as far as practicable,
and we have distinctly laid down the policy to be pursued in
respect of this drug in our Resolution of the 17th December 1873
already quoted. The annual reports of Excise Administration show
that the subject has since been continually before Local
Governments, who are making every possible endeavour to minimise
the evils and discourage the use of the drug wherever it is a
source of danger to consumers.&quot; Thus &quot;restraining the
use and improving, the revenue by the imposition of suitable
taxation,&quot; &quot;discouraging<i> </i>the consumption by
placing restrictions on the cultivation, preparation, and retail,
and imposing on their use as high a rate of duty as can be levied
without inducing illicit practices,&quot; &quot;limiting the
production and sale by a high rate of duty without placing the
drug entirely beyond the reach of those who will insist upon
having it,&quot;<i> </i>&quot;restricting consumption as far as
practicable, minimising the evils, and discouraging the use of
the drug wherever it is a source of danger to consumers&quot;
have from time to time been the watch-words of the Government in
the matter of the hemp drugs, a policy only once definitely
abandoned, <i>viz., </i>in the case of Burma, where total
prohibition was introduced in 1873. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Prohibition in other countries.</b> </p>

<p>557. Allusion must be made to precedents for the prohibition
of the hemp drugs in other countries in order to complete these
general observations. Excepting British Burma (reference to which
will be made further on), the Commission only know of four cases
of prohibition, <i>viz., </i>in Turkey, Egypt, Greece, and
Trinidad. For the first three of these, the only information at
the disposal of the Commission is contained in the communications
from Her Majesty's representatives addressed to the Secretary of
State for Foreign Affairs in 1892 in consequence of a requisition
made on them by the Earl of Rosebery at the request of Mr. W S
Caine, M.P.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Turkey</b> </p>

<p>558. The ground of the prohibition in Turkey is thus stated in
a note addressed by the Grand Vizir to the Ministry Commerce,
Constantinople, on 1st March 1292 <i>(sic)</i>:&quot;From<i> </i>the
reports furnished by the Imperial Medical Council, it appeared
that the use of hashish in the preparation of medicines was
extremely rare, and that, being a narcotic, its use must of
necessity be injurious, and that consequently the suppression of
the cultivation of hashish could not fail to prove highly
advantageous.&quot; The effect of the prohibition is thus
described in an enclosure to the Ambassador's reply: &quot;The
importation and sale in Turkey of hashish, though contraband, is
still, I hear, largely carried on, and is used for smoking, in
the composition of various sweetmeats, and as an opiate in
general.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p><b>Egypt.</b> </p>

<p>559. In Egypt the cultivation, use, and importation of hashish
were first forbidden in 1868, but in 1874 it was allowed to be
imported on payment of duty. In November 1877 an order was
received from Constantinople that all hashish brought into Egypt
was to be seized and destroyed, and finally, in March 1879, the
importation and cultivation of hashish were prohibited by a
Khedivial decree. In March 1884 it was provided that confiscated
hashish should be sold by the Customs (for delivery abroad)
instead of being destroyed as formerly, and the proceeds of the
sale divided amongst the informers and officers who took part in
the seizure. &quot;This measure was rendered necessary,&quot;
says Mr. Caillard, the Director-General of the Customs, &quot;by<i>
</i>the absence of any fund from which rewards could be
distributed; while, on the other hand, the profits of smuggling
being very great, large sums were paid by the smugglers to insure
the silence or complicity of the Customs officers,
coastguards-men, and others. A considerable number of persons are
employed in the smuggling trade, many of them having subsistence.
Great ingenuity is displayed by the smugglers no other means of
and no sooner has one trick been discovered than another isin
this illicit trade, of the contrainvented. The great obstacle,
however, to the complete repression band trade is the refusal of
some of the European Governments to recognize the right of the
Egyptian Government to search suspected shops or warehouses, and
to punish the delinquents by fine as well as confiscation. In
view of the impossibility of suppressing the contraband trade in
hashish under the suggested to the Minister of Finance
circumstances described above, desirability of removing the
prohibition against the importation of the and I proposed to
collect a customs duty of P. T. 100 per kilogramme (<i>9s. 3d.</i>per
lb.), besides it license-tax on the sale of hashish. It has been
abundantly proved that the vice of hashish smoking cannot be
suppressed by legislation, whereas by a system of licenses it may
be kept under control to some extent. &quot;Mr. Caillard
estimates that the quantity of hashish consumed annually in Egypt
cannot be less than 50,000 okes (about lbs. 140,000)
notwithstanding the prohibition. He states that the hashish
appears to be manufactured chiefly in Greece. </p>

<p><b>Greece.</b> </p>

<p>560. In Greece there is no law regulating or specially
alluding to the product as merchandise is allowed, but a Police
order of 1891 prohibits its sale and consumption in the small
cafes of Athens and the Piroeus, in some of which, during the
previous ten or fifteen years apparently, the habit of using this
drug had been gradually introduced. The order was based upon a
report of the Sanitary Board at Athens, in which prominent
mention is made of the observations made in India by English
doctors, and the statistics of insanity in Bengal lunatic asylums
ascribed to the use of the hemp drugs are put forward as
justifying, repressive measures. The effect of the order passed
is not mentioned, sufficient time not having elapsed.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Trinidad..</b> </p>

<p>561<i>. </i>As regards Trinidad, the Commission are not sure
that the hemp drugs are prohibited. The fact has been stated by
the Indian Immigrants Commission, Natal, 1885-87, and by Dr.
Thomas Ireland, Government Medical Officer, British Guiana, in a
paper published in the <i>Alienist and Neurologist, </i>St.
Louis, in October 1893. But,<i> </i>on the other hand,
Surgeon-Major Comins, lately on special duty in British and
Foreign Colonies and the Netherlands, in his Note on Emigration
from India to Trinidad, 1893, quotes a statement of the Protector
of Immigrants, who says that in the year 1885 an Ordinance was
passed requiring the payment of L100 per acre to obtain a license
to grow ganja, which had previously been grown in large
quantities. This practically put a stop to the growth and
consumption for several years, but immigrants who had left
Trinidad two years previous to the writing of his report had been
growing it in Venezuela, and several seizures had been made by
the Customs officers from persons endeavouring to introduce it
into Trinidad. The Protector adds: &quot;With<i> </i>a coast line
such as ours, adjacent to that of the Spanish Main, it will be
impossible to prevent its introduction into this colony if
immigrants who go there continue to grow it.&quot; Dr. Comins
himself says: &quot;I do not know what are the laws in force here
regarding the sale of opium and ganja.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p><b>Basis of prohibition and results in these countries</b>. </p>

<p>562.<i> </i>Thus in the case of other countries, where the use
of the drugs has been prohibited, the Commission do not find in
the literature available to them many arguments for prohibition.
In Turkey it rests upon the theory accepted by orthodox
Muhammadans that hashish <i>&quot;being </i>a narcotic its use
must of necessity be injurious,&quot; while in Egypt the
prohibition emanated from Turkey. In both these countries the
measure has by no means been attended with complete success. In
Greece the prohibition in the cafes of Athens is based largely
upon Indian experience, which the Commission have had cause in
great measure to recast. In Trinidad, if there has been
prohibition, it does not seem of late to have been effectual. It
must be added that the Commission have no scientific information
regarding the strength of the article of commerce called hashish,
and it may differ to some extent from the Indian products. From
the description of its manufacture even by the Mayor of
Orchomenus in Mantines in Arcadia, whence the Egyptian supply is
mainly derived, it appears to resemble more the charas of Yarkand
than the ganja or bhang of India.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Is prohibition in India justifiable, feasible, and
advisable?</b> </p>

<p>563. Starting, therefore, from the position that what is known
of the hemp drugs in the past is not sufficient to justify their
prohibition in India, and that for such a measure there must be
strong justification based on ascertained facts scientifically
and systematically examined, the first question for the
Commission to decide is whether such justification is to be found
in the evidence before them, and the second-whether, if this is
so, prohibition is feasible and advisable on other grounds. These
will now be considered. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Prohibition of bhang</b> </p>

<p>564. The effects of the hemp drugs have been treated in
Chapters X to XIII of the Report; and as the first result of
these conclusions, the Commission are prepared to state that the
suppression of the use of bhang would be totally unjustifiable.
It is established to their satisfaction that this use is very
ancient, and that it has some religious tion among a large body
of Hindus; that it enters into their social customs; that it is
almost without exception harmless in moderation, and perhaps in
some cases beneficial; that the abuse of it is not so harmful as
the abuse of alcohol; that its suppression, involving the
extirpation of the wild hemp plant, would in some tracts be a
matter of great difficulty; that such a measure would be
extremely unpopular, and would give rise to widespread
discontent; and, finally, that, if successfully accomplished, it
would lead to the use of more hurtful stimulants. The Commission
deem it unnecessary to traverse the evidence further than has
been done in the preceding chapters of this report in support of
these propositions. It is almost unanimous in regard to them. The
utmost that is necessary in regard to this product is that it
should be brought under more effective control, and this matter
will be dealt with further on. But absolute prohibition is, in
the opinion of the Commission, entirely out of the question. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Prohibition of ganja and charas</b> </p>

<p>565. Though it has been shown that as a rule ganja and charas
are used in moderation, and that the moderate use ordinarily.
does not cause appreciable injury, yet it has been established
that the excessive use of these forms of hemp drugs has been more
injurious than in the case of bhang. Whether they should be
prohibited or merely controlled is a question which might be
settled merely with reference to their ascertained effects. The
Commission consider that the effects are not such as to call for
prohibition, and on the general principles discussed in the
opening paragraphs of this chapter, such interference would be
unjustifiable. Nevertheless, it. seems advisable to refer to the
other evidence with a view to ascertaining the generally
prevailing views on the subject, and considering the grounds on
which prohibition is advocated or opposed.<br>
</p>

<p><b>The evidence regarding prohibition of ganja and charas may
be considered together.</b> </p>

<p>566. In reviewing the evidence on these points, it will not be
necessary to draw a distinction between ganja and charas. The
effects of these two drugs have been shown to be similar, though
charas is <i>cateris paribus </i>the more potent. They are both
ordinarily smoked, though very occasionally used for eating and
drinking usually in the form of admixtures with other condiments
stated by Mr. Lyall (Bengal 1): &quot;Ganja<i> </i>and charas are
really one, and in time, if the question be scientifically
followed up, possibly charas will be the only form used.&quot;
The refuse of ganja is used in some provinces as bhang, but this
substance more nearly resembles bhang than ganja properly so
called. The ganja of the different provinces varies in quality.
But these distinctions cannot here be specially observed; it will
be sufficient to bear in mind that the opinions in Bengal, the
Central Provinces, Madras, Bombay, and the smaller
Administrations relate to ganja; that those in the Punjab relate
to charas; and that those in the North-Western Provinces and Sind
relate to ganja and charass, both of which consumed.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Supply of ganja and charas in its relation to prohibition.<font
face="Arial"></b><font size="4"> </font></font> </p>

<p>567. A few remarks, however, recapitulating the local
conditions of ganja and charas will not be out of place. Charas
is practically a foreign article. Small amounts are imported from
Nepal and Gwalior, but they may be left out of the account. The
bulk comes from Yarkand through the Himalayan passes, or to a
much smaller. degree from offer parts of Central Asia through the
routes on the frontier of Afghanistan. It would not be a very
difficult matter to stop these imports, though the co-operation
of the Kashmir Darbar would be necessary in regard to Yarkand
charas. It may, therefore, be accepted that the supply of charas
might be cut off without much difficulty, though, as this article
forms the principal import from Yarkand, the prohibition of
charas would paralyse, if not extinguish, the trade with this
country. In regard to ganja, the problem is more complex. Ganja
is regularly cultivated in Bengal, the Central Provinces, Madras,
Bombay, and Berar. In Bengal and the Central Provinces, the
cultivation of the hemp, plant for its production is under
complete control. In Berer cultivation is only permitted under
license. In the other tracts of British territory it is not
directly Controlled. Assuming that control is possible in these
tracts, it does not follow that it would be equally possible to
prevent cultivation altogether. Moreover, there still remains a
considerable amount of production in many of the Native States
all over India. To induce these States to prohibit cultivation
would be a difficult matter, and, even if this were done, the
suppression of illicit cultivation would offer the most serious
difficulties. For, though ganja of good quality requires some
cultivation and tending, the evidence before the Commission tends
to establish the fact that ganja of an inferior kind can be
manufactured from the spontaneous or casual growth which is found
near human habitations and amidst cultivation of other crops in
many parts of India. While, therefore, it cannot be asserted that
the task of preventing the manufacture of ganja is an impossible
one, it would certainly at the present time be attended with
considerable difficulty.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Opinions of the witnesses regarding prohibition of ganja
and charas. </b></p>

<p>568. The question addressed to the. witnesses regarding the
prohibition of the hemp drugs (No. 35) was so framed as to elicit
in the first place opinions as to the feasibility of such. a
measure. The considerations bearing upon the subject were also
set forth in the form of subsidiary questions. The question
whether the witnesses advocated prohibition. was not specifically
put, but it is not difficult, comparing the answers to the
questions above mentioned with those relating to other questions,
to decide what the opinion of each witness is on this question.
Those who hold decided views have no doubt generally stated them
in some portion of their answers, and at all events ample
opportunity of doing so was afforded them. A larger number of the
witnesses have contented themselves with merely giving an
affirmative or negative answer to the questions on .the subject.
It is impossible to attach much importance to such answers. The
Commission have abstracted them and considered them, but they
feel bound to give far more weight to the opinions of witnesses
whose replies show that they have formulated an opinion, on the
desirability of prohibition. Some account will now be given of
these answers.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Opinions regarding prohibition of ganja and charas.</b> </p>

<p><i>569. </i>Out of the total of 1,193 witnesses, 575 have
expressed a decided opinion on the question of prohibition. Of
these only 99 advocate it in their answers. The remainder are
against it. The classification of these witnesses is shown in the
following table:<br>
</p>

</p>

<p>Thus, not only is there a very large preponderance of opinion
against prohibition, but the preponderance is specially marked
among superior Civil officers. The only witnesses indeed of the
latter class who favour prohibition are three in the Punjab,
where charas and not ganja is consumed.<br>
</p>

<p>The most important of these opinions on either side will now
be specified. The most forcible opinions in favour of prohibition
will be quoted at some length in order that the argument for this
view may be .thoroughly appreciated. The opinions against
prohibition are too numerous to be quoted, but the witnesses will
be named under headings setting forth the most prominent views
expressed. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Bengal opinions in favour of prohibition of ganja</b> </p>

<p>570. The Bengal witnesses in favour of prohibition of ganja
consist of a Sub-Deputy Collector, an Assistant Surgeon. two
Medical Practitioners, an Honorary Magistrate, two zamindars, two
pleaders, a delegate from the Indian Relief Society, Calcutta,
the Secretary to the Band of Hope, Faridpur, the Secretary to the
Bogra Medical Society, and two Missionaries. The Commission
cannot find much to quote from these opinions, but the following
are the most forcible: </p>

<p><i>(238) Delegate, Indian Relief Society, Calcutta, Babu
Amrita Krishna Mullick, B.A., B.L.: </i>After quoting official
and medical opinions relating to the injuriousness of ganja, the
Society, endeavours to show that the cultivators of the hemp
plant lose largely by their occupation, and maintains that it is
the duty of the Government to come to their rescue by abolishing
it. The society maintains that the privation to the consumers
would not be serious, and that it is difficult to suggest any
drug more deleterious than ganja to which they could take. The
Society contends that the alleged religious sanction to the use
of the drugs is a fallacy, and refers to the opinions of several
pandits in support of this view. The Society argues that to meet
the deficit in the revenue, which would be about lakhs per annum,
the salaries of European officers should be cut down, the duties
on cotton goods re-imposed and the income-tax increased with an
enhanced taxable minimum. Savings would be effected by reduction
of establishment and by decreased cost of lunatic asylums.<br>
</p>

<p><i>(286) Secretary, Band of Hope Temperance Society, Faridpur,
Babu Purna Chandra Maitra: </i>&quot;This Society begs to urge
upon the Commission to consider the justice and propriety of a
just, benign, and Christian Government to allow cultivation and
sale of a drug which has been excluded from some countries, and
in England doubly protected in the poison list.&quot; The witness
argues that the drug&quot; has been unreservedly condemned by
eminent doctors as one of the most dangerous poisons known, as
the most potent cause of lunacy, and as the most pernicious and
deleterious of all excitants ever in use in any country.&quot; He
admits that there are a number of yogis, sanyasis, fakirs, and
mendicants addicted to ganja smoking, but states that ganja
smoking forms no part of their religion, and there is not a
single Hindu or Muhammadan religious book which sanctions the use
of ganja. &quot;No real disaffection can under the benign rule of
the British Government be seriously apprehended, and, even in the
event of there being such apprehension, the fact should not be
lost sight of that the Government in this case will have the
support of the bulk of the population.&quot; He alleges that
ganja produces crime, and that the taxation, amounting to 22
lakhs, is a drain on the poverty-stricken and half-famished
people of Bengal. He finds it difficult to suggest a substitute
for ganja, but liquor may be one, and a peculiar preparation of
strong tobacco may also serve the purpose. </p>

<p><i>(134) Secretary to Bogra Medical Society (10 members),
Pyari SankerDass </i>Gupta, L.M.S.: &quot;the prohibition will
give rise to no political danger. For the ganja smokers have very
little influence over society. The Government has faced questions
of a greater religious character, as the Suttee or the Age of
Consent Act, with boldness. This is comparatively a minor
question affecting only depraved men.&quot; </p>

<p><i>(203) Rev. W. B. Phillips, Missionary.: </i>&quot;What<i> </i>with
liquor and opium and hemp drugs of various kinds, all licensed by
Government, it does seem as if the population were terribly
exposed to degrading influences. It is not my province to face
the difficult task of dealing with these evils; and I sincerely
sympathize with the Government in the heavy duty of solving the
grave problems involved. But I do feel it my duty to set forth as
strongly as possible the assurance that very much mischief is
being worked in the country by the various intoxicants so freely
and largely sold. I hardly care to distinguish between opium,
alcohol, and ganja. I regard them all as bad. My mind is so
impressed with the evil effects of excessive use that I do not
care to consider the moderate use. I would wish Government to
begin with ganja, to proceed with little delay-against opium, and
then tackle alcohol. I prefer this as a matter of policy, as
ganja is easiest dealt with I am prepared to prohibit all three
intoxicants on account of the evil which I see done by them. </p>

<p><i>(81) Kali Das Mukerji, Sub-Deputy Collector: </i>After
advocating prohibition of ganja on the grounds of the evil
effects, and stating that there would be no danger from the
discontent caused owing to the small number of the consumers, the
witness proceeds: &quot;The<i> </i>reasons usually put forward in
favour of ganja consumption are as follows: (1) that Hindu friars
and jogis cannot do without it, for it helps them in their
religious contemplation, and sustains them under severe exertion
and exposure; (2) that it is a safeguard against disease in
malarious tracts; and (3) that it serves the labouring classes as
a refreshing stimulant, alleviating fatigue. I do not think that
any of these reasons is conclusive, though plausible. In fact,
none of them stands the test of close examination. If any
intoxicating drug is at all necessary for friars and jogis
alcohol, opium or siddhi may serve the purpose. Eight kinds of
intoxicating drugs are prescribed in the Tantras for Hindu
devotees, and it is optional with them to take any if they care
to do so at all. That ganja is a safeguard against disease in
malarious tracts is not necessarily true Even as a stimulant and
remover of fatigue, ganja has very little to recommend it to the
labouring classes A careful observation is sure to establish the
fact that any ordinary labourer whose only stimulant is tobacco
is on the whole a better workman than his ganja consuming
brother.&quot; <br>

<p><b>Assam.Assam.Opinions in favour of prohibition of ganja.</b>
</p>

<p>572. The opinions in favour of prohibition of ganja in Assam
are those of a Civil Surgeon, the Secretary to the Tezpur Raiyats
Association, the Secretary to the Upper Assam .Association, a
merchant, and a pensioned Overseer, Public Works Department, and
member of a Local Board. There is nothing especially to note in
these opinions. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Opinions against.</b>. </p>

<p>573. Against prohibition we have the Commissioner of the Assam
Valley, the Commissioner of Excise, the Director of Land Records
and Agriculture, an Officiating Deputy Commissioner, a Civil
Surgeon, an Extra Assistant Commissioner, a medical practitioner,
four pleaders, and four planters.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Mr. Driberg,</i><b><i> </i></b><i>Commissioner of Excise</i>,
says: &quot;It would be useless to prohibit the use of ganja in a
province like Assam, surrounded as it is by independent hill
people, who would cultivate it in their hills and smuggle it down
with little risk of detection. Any prohibition will only lead to
the increase of illicit consumption and to the secret use of the
drug, which would be decidedly bad; of course, stop cultivation
in Bengal, and the prohibition of the use of excise ganja could
be enforced; but there would be serious discourse, though in this
province it might not amount to a political danger, and the
prohibition would be followed by recourse to opium, and in some
cases to alcohol.&quot; The evidence of planters tends generally
to show that the use of ganja by the garden coolies, who (except
in the western districts of the Assam Valley and those of the
Surma Valley, all of which border on Bengal) are the principal
consumers, produces no serious effects. There is nothing in any
of the Assam evidence to controvert these views. <br>
</p>

<p><b>North-Western Provinces.Opinions in favour of prohibition
of ganja and charas.</b> </p>

<p>574. The advocates of prohibition of ganja and charas in the
North-Western Provinces are as follows: 6 subordinate civil
officers, 9 subordinate medical officers and private medical
practitioners, and 18 non-officials. Butfew of these witnesses
give any reasons for their opinions. And the Commission are not
able to quote any one of them as having any special weight. The
only opinion which it appears worth while to quote is that of a
Collector (Mr. Addis (4), who does not, however, specifically
recommend prohibition. He says: &quot;It probably would be
feasible to prohibit the use of all these drugs. Public opinion
is against their use, and the people are very obedient to
authority. The prohibition would certainly lead to the increased
use of opium and alcohol.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Opinions against prohibition.</b> </p>

<p>575. On the other hand, the opinions against prohibition are
very strong. The following is an analysis of some of the most
important:- </p>

<p><i>(1) Prohibition impossible or unnecessary, or could not be
enforced without a large preventive establishment.</i> </p>

<p>(1) Hon'ble A. Cadell, Member, Board of Revenue.(5) Mr.
Stoker, Commissioner of Excise(12) Mr. Brownrigg, Officiating

<p><i>(3) Prohibition might lead to use of dhatura or other
intoxicants worse than ganja or charas.</i> </p>

<p>(6) Mr. Stoker, Commissioner of Excise.(15) Mr. Ferard,
Collector (28) Mr. Bruce, Assistant Collector.(51) Thakur Tukman
Singh, Deputy Collector. Punjab 576. The advocates of the
prohibition of charas Opinions for prohibition of charas. in the
Punjab are as follows:-- 3 superior civil officers, 3 subordinate
civi1 officers, 2 subordinate medical officers, and 10
non-officials.It may be noted that <i>Mr. Ogilvie, Financial
Commissioner in charge of Excise (2), </i>records the following
opinion: &quot;I am inclined to hold the opinion, though I am not
quite satisfied on the subject, that the use of charas is so
deleterious that it might be permissible, both on grounds of
morality and utility, for its use to be prohibited or for the
price of the drug to be so artificially raised as to confine its
consumption to a very small number indeed. The reason why I say
that I am not quite satisfied on the point is because I have not
sufficiently investigated the facts. All that I can, therefore,
say with certainty is that my opinion tends to the direction
above indicated I would observe, however, with regard to the
Yarkand trade that the imposition of a duty so high as to be
practically prohibitive would very considerably injure that
trade, . because the Yarkand trader in exchange for the churns
takes back the products of the Punjab to his own country or to
Kashmir. The extinction or serious injury of the Yarkand trade
would, of course, be a very regrettable circumstance. On the
other hand from my personal knowledge as Deputy Commissioner of
the Dera  Ismail Khan District, I would say no harm would
accrue to general trade on the western border from the
prohibition of churns.&quot; </p>

<p><i>Mr. Coldstream. Deputy Commissioner (5), </i>though he does
not seem to have formed a definite opinion regarding the moderate
use of the drugs, says: &quot;The <i>gradual </i>stoppage of
import of ganja and charas might be tried. It is not as yet a
very widely-spread habit, but it might grow. It would cause gent
pain and discontent if the prohibition were sudden and
comprehensive, but this would not amount to political danger. A
prohibitory measure regarding ganja and charas would no doubt be
followed at once by a recourse to opium and alcohol. I can quite
believe the moderate occasional use of the drugs may be
comparatively harmless, but I am not aware that they are commonly
used occasionally and in moderation. They may, however, be so
used for all I know.&quot; </p>

<p><i>Mr. Wilson, Deputy Commissioner (14), </i>says that he
should like to see the experiment made in selected districts of
prohibiting trade in charas (and bhang) all together. As regards
charas, he thinks the prohibition would be feasible, as it is
imported, and the discontent would be insignificant. knows of no
class, such as labourers, who take the drug in moderation as an
ordinary stimulant. Among fakirs and other excessive consumers,
he thinks the use produces great evils, and that there is no more
harmful drug which they are likely to take to. He does not know
anything of the use of dhatura except its administration as a
poison. He thinks sudden prohibition would be cruel. He would
therefore begin by taxation and gradually raise it, leaving the
question of total prohibition to be decided by experience. The
evidence of <i>Arjan Singh, Extra Assistant Commissioner </i>(19),
is much to the same effect, but he states that the use of dhatura
is general among the followers of Siva at the Shivratri in the
Dera Ghazi Khan district. He says it is taken in very small
quantities, so that its effect is almost imperceptible. <i>General
Millet (69), </i>formerly District Superintendent of Police,
would like to see all intoxicants prohibited which cannot be
proved to be actually necessary. He thinks gradual prohibition of
the hemp drugs feasible, and that educated, intelligent native
public opinion, which to a great extent leads that of the lower
classes, would support prohibition. Discontent at first among the
degraded classes would be inevitable, but there would be no
political danger, though tact and discretion would be needed and
calm-minded European officials at the helm. He fears that
recourse to alcohol would be the result. <i>Shekh Riaz Husain,
zamindar (67), </i>thinks that &quot;having regard for the
welfare and good of the people which the British Government has
in view, the prohibition of the hemp drugs (including bhang) is
imperatively necessary. Loyal and intelligent subjects and
well-wishers of the country would welcome the prohibition, though
the unscrupulous habitual consumers would indeed dislike it. But
as it would be for the good of the people, it is not hoped that
any class of persons would resent it. The enforcement of the
prohibition should be effected like other new laws and
regulations, exceptions being made to some extent in the case of
the existing old habitual consumers, because its sudden stoppage
would cause them serious privation. The discontent resulting
would not amount to a political danger. If it were possible to
make charas as expensive as alcohol, that would be one way of
dealing with the subject.&quot;<i>Sardar Sujan Singh, Rai
Bahadur, Contractor (59), </i>considers charas as certainly most
injurious, and thinks its use should most certainly be
prohibited. It does no good to anybody. There are not many <i>kahars
</i>who take it. Those who do, go to the bad. He does not know of
the use. of dhatura as an intoxicant. The use of madak and chandu
is more injurious than charas, and they also should be prohibited
as well as liquor. He would not recommend immediate prohibition,
but would put on such a tax, increasing it gradually, as to make
it impossible for the majority of people to buy them at all.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Dr. H. M. Clark, Missionary (46), </i>would like to see
charas prohibited if it were possible, He thinks. however, that
alcohol does more harm than charas. He cannot believe that a
moderate use of charas is possible. Fakirs and devotees are the
chief consumers. <i>Devi Dayal, Editor of the Kaitistha Mitra,*
Lahore, </i>circulation 300 copies (83), says: &quot;If charas be
called poison (fatal, killing, murdering drug), it is not an
exaggeration of any kind. It is a great vice to smoke charas. May
God not give this even in the lot of a foe. Only just people as
have bad luck get engaged in this vice. Government will do their
subjects a very great obligation by saving them from early death
and whirlpool of destruction and ruin. My present belief is that
there is no such thing as moderation in the use of chards,
because, when a c<i>harsi </i>visits another, he offers him the c<i>hillum,
</i>and they smoke in company. The smoke is thus repeated
frequently.&quot; Consumers acknowledge that they would have no
complaint; and if Government were to prohibit the use of charas
to-morrow, the bad habit would die out of itself. <i>Ganesh Das,
Pleader, and President, Sarin Sabha, Hoshiarpur </i>(77): Charas
jogis, sanyasis, and suthra fakirs, andis consumed by shoemakers,
musicians, by some Khatris and Brahmins. The physical effects are
very bad, and most consumers become incapacitated for work and
lead a miserable life. The subcommittee of the Sarin Sabha
appointed to consider the subject recommend prohibition. Enquiry
was not made from medical experts. Consumers would not take to
other intoxicants, because the intoxication of chards is not like
that of opium or other intoxicants. The greatest loss would be
that of the traders of Hoshiarpur and Amritsar, who take
merchandise to Ladakh and Yarkand and bring back charas.<br>

<p><b>Madrass </b><b><tt>Opinions in favour </tt></b><b>of </b><b><tt>the
prohibition of ganja</tt></b> </p>

<p>580. The Madras witnesses in favour of prohibition are a Civil
Surgeon, a subordinate civil officer, a medical practitioner, a
Hindu priest, and six missionaries. Dr. King, (85) says-
&quot;The restriction of the sale of ganja under conditions
similar to those required for poisonous drugs in Great Britain
would be an unqualified blessing to the country, thus contrasting
with the action taken against agitation which I believe to be
unnecessary and mischievous. I consider special measures should
be taken to restrain the use of ganja by sepoys, and especially
to prevent the young sepoy from acquiring the habit&quot; In oral
examination however, Dr. King, stated as follows- &quot;My
opinion of the effect of the moderate use in impairing the moral
sense and inducing laziness, etc., is a general impression and
not based on actual observation. My impression is based on the
fact that persons alleged to have been ganja smokers have
presented these characteristics. They were pointed out as
notorious ganja smokers. I did not discriminate in these cases
between the moderate and excessive use.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p><i>Synd Mahmud(I22) </i>says: &quot;It<i> </i>is an
unquestionable fact that ganja, bhang, and charas are poisons,
and this fact is admitted by all. In my opinion their suppression
would be an act of virtue deserving of future reward, but it is
not advisable to suppress their use at once. Its suppression
should be regulated under certain rules without any loss to the
State. To the best of my knowledge and researches, alcohol cannot
be safely used as a substitute for ganja, charas, and
bhang.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p><i>Rev. Mr. Laflamme </i>(153) speaking on behalf of the
Baptist Missionary Conferences of the Presidency, advocates
prohibition in these terms: &quot;Owing to the scarcity of shops
in these parts practical prohibition exists. Much that is
consumed is consumed illicitly. The introduction of the license
system Seems to have had no appreciable effect on the use of the
drugs. The ganja is nearly all grown by the consumers in their
own yards.&quot; &quot;The drugs should all be so safeguarded as
to prevent or minimize any possible harm resulting from their
abuse.&quot; &quot;The<i> </i>general sense of the people is
opposed to the use of the drugs.&quot; So far as the witness can
gather, the members of the Mission are. united in the belief that
in these parts hemp drugs are far less injurious than opium and
alcohol; thus far that the latter are not only much more
extensively used, but much more baleful in, their effects. Two
other missionaries, though neutral in opinion, are worth quoting <i>Rev.
Mr. Pittendrigh Missionary (160) </i>says that he would have
ultimate prohibition in view if possible, but there is not much
ground for special interference in anything that he has seen.
Another Missionary, the <i>Rev. Mr. Goffin. </i>(145), cannot
undertake to criticise the present or any system of exise
administration. His impression is that Government would be wise
to adopt strictly &quot;let-alone&quot; policy, leaving it to the
spread of education and enlightenment among the people to prevent
and lessen all its effects. The province government should be
carefully to watch such effects, and wherever and whenever
necessary interfere with prohibitive legislation. Such necessity,
however, in his opinion would not often occur.<br>

<p><b>Bombay. Opinions in favour of prohibition of ganja.</b> </p>

<p>582. For the prohibition of ganja or charas in Bombay and
Sind, we have the following advocates: in Bombay two mamlatdars,
a hospital assistant, and a medical practitioner; and in Sind a
health officer, two hospital assistants, and a. banker. There is
not much that need be quoted from the evidence of these
witnesses. It may be noted that the Hon'ble T. D. Mackenzie,
Commissioner of Abkari, etc. (1), holds that the policy of
Government in relation to the hemp drugs should be one of
restriction, as far as restriction, 'is possible, and that, if
absolute prohibition were possible, he thinks it would be a good
thing. Owing, however, to the fact that the territories of the
Bombay Presidency interlace so extensively with foreign
territory, and to the feeling which would be aroused among the
consumers and those who sympathize with them, it would in his
opinion be impossible or undesirable. The Secretary to the Arya
Samaj in Bombay (109) states that while fully sympathising with
the objects of the Commission, which are apparently understood to
be the restriction or prohibition of the drugs, the Arya Samaj
&quot;is of opinion that any Governmental action in the direction
of further restricting the preparation and sale of the drug will
be productive of very little good. The <b>' </b>* Samaj believes
that education of the masses is the only proper and effective .
remedy for correcting such baneful habits, and fears that any
compulsion in<b> </b>this matter is likely to drive the consumers
of these comparatively innoccuous drugs to the use. of more
injurious intoxicants that are plentifully supplied to the people
like the various preparations containing alcohol.&quot; The
Samaj.prays that the Government will devise measures for the
restriction of the sale of European liquor in India. and leave
the hemp drugs to themselves. The only<b> </b>thorough advocate
of prohibition whose opinion is worth specifying is Rao
SahibShesho Krisna Madkavi (41), who considers-such prohibition
very necessary and holds that, although there would be temporary
discontent among the consumers such discontent would not amount
to a political danger &quot;the<i> </i>people in this part of the
country being loyal and of mild nature. and the proportion of the
persons using bhang and ganja to the general population being too
small to be taken into consideration.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p><b>Opinions against prohibition</b> </p>

<p>583. On the other hand, the opinions against prohibition are
weighty. The following may be specially quoted:<br>
</p>

<p><i>(1) Prohibition impossible or unnecessary, or could not be
enforced without a large preventive establishment. Bombay</i> </p>

<p>(1) Hon'ble T. D. Mackenzie, Commissioner of Abkari, etc (3)

</i></p>

<p><i>Bombay. </i></p>

<p>(l) Hon'ble T. D. Mackenzie, Commissioner of Abkari, etc. (2)
Mr. Reid, Commissioner ganja. Apart from all this, there is
another consideration which has been urged in some quarters with
a manifestation of strong feeling, and to which the Commission
are disposed to attach some importance, <i>viz.</i>, that to
repress the drugs in India and to leave alcohol alone would be
misunderstood by a large number of persons who believe, and
apparently not without reason, that more harm is done in this
country by the latter than by the former. The conclusion of the
Commission regarding bhang has been given in paragraph 564; under
all the circumstances they now unhesitatingly give their verdict
against such a violent measure as total prohibition in respect of
any of the hemp drugs.<br>
</p>

<p><b>II. The policy advocated is one of control and restriction
aimed at suppressing the excessive use and restraining the
moderate use within due limits (Chapter XlV, paragraph 586) <br>

<p><b>Policy in regard to hemp drugs.</b> </p>

<p><tt>586 </tt>Failing prohibition, the question arises, what
should be the policy of the Policy in regard to hemp drugs.
Government in regard to the hemp drugs? On this point some
important evidence has been recorded, and the Commission deem it
to be within the scope of their duty to state in general terms
their own conclusions. In the first place, then, they are of
opinion that in view of the harmful effects produced by the
excessive use, and in exceptional cases even by the moderate use,
of the drugs, the action of the Government should be directed
towards restraining the former and avoiding all encouragement to
the latter. The object should be to prevent the consumers, as far
as may be possible, from doing harm to themselves and to lessen
the inducements to the formation of the habit which might lead to
such harm In aiming at this object, however, other considerations
need to be kept in view. There is in the first place the question
of illicit consumption. If the restriction. imposed by Government
is counterbalanced by a corresponding increase in smuggling no
advantage is gained but, on the contrary, a moral wrong is done
to the community apart from the annoyance necessitated by such
restrictions. Than, if there is a legitimate use of the drugs,
restrictions should not be such as to make the exercise of this
use impossible. The Commission have formed the opinion that there
is a legitimate use of the hemp drugs, and that it exists
generally among the poorest of the population. Again, if the
restrictions lead to the use of more deleterious substances, or
even drive the people from a habit the evil of which is known to
another of which the evil maybe greater, they are no longer
justifiable. The policy of Government must be tempered by all
these considerations, and the neglect of any one of them may lead
to serious error. <br>

<p align="center">INDIAN HEMP AND THE DOPE FIENDS OF OLD ENGLAND </p>

<p align="center"><b>A sociopolitical history of cannabis and the
British Empire 1840-1928</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>Sean Blanchard &amp; Matthew J. Atha MSc</b></p>

<p>When the report of the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission (IHDC)
reached 1890's England it met official and public apathy. There
was no political debate. It went into the 'forget about this'
file on arrival and has stayed there ever since. There was no
publicity; The news that &quot;Ganja is not appreciably
harmful&quot; was of no concern to the majority of users, who
took cannabis products for their medical benefits. The
non-medical users were mostly artists who didn't <u>mind </u>a
little harm. Prohibitionist sentiment was concentrated on the
opium trade between India and China and on alcohol at home.
Cannabis use in England was considered negligible, and the
authorities were content to have no laws at all controlling <b>it
</b>for another thirty years.<br>
</p>

<p>When laws were later proposed, the Government paid no
attention to the evidence in their possession from the IHDC. In
India, the recommendations of the IHDC report for control by
taxes rather than prohibition went into force quietly,
standardising laws and tariffs on cannabis in all the provinces.
In March 1895, the Indian Government passed a resolution after
reviewing the report. It said that for the last twenty years
their policy had been of &quot;restraining use and improving the
revenue by the imposition of suitable taxation&quot; and
&quot;imposing as high a rate of duty as can be levied without
inducing illicit practices&quot; on the grounds that &quot;the
best way to restrict the consumption of drugs is to tax
them...&quot; So, &quot;to that policy the Governor-General...
has decided steadily to adhere.&quot;[1]<br>
</p>

<p>There was never any suggestion that the same rules might be
applied in the UK; the Empire didn't work like that. The
Governor-General (also known as Viceroy), Lord Landsdowne, was
appointed by the UK Government. When they instructed him to
commission a report, he did so, then accepted or rejected it,
passed any regulations needed, and told the UK what he'd done.
His job was to 'keep natives in their place' and help the British
get on with de, not to give advice on home affairs.<br>
</p>

<p><b>From Mother's Friend to Opium Wars<br>
</b></p>

<p>Cannabis was virtually irrelevant to 19th century England. The
drug of the century was opium, freely available to the British
population and so popular that the government went to war to
prevent the prohibitionist Chinese disrupting the trade. The
opium wars still write their history in the 1990s, as Britain is
soon due to hand back Hong Kong, the territory it won from China
and those territories leased for 150 years, in 1997.<br>
</p>

<p>Thomas De Quincy, in his 'Confessions of and English Opium
Eater' gave the first popular account of the '...marvellous
agency of opium, whether for pleasure or pain'. He may have been
the first glamouriser of the psychotropic effects of the drug,
but, for most people opium was a friend and medicine as
indispensable as aspirin or Valium in the 20th century. Godfrey's
cordial, or chemists' home-brewed versions of popular patent
medicines, were used to quiet children, while no home would be
without laudanum (alcoholic tincture of opium). Opium was first
used in the treatment of cholera in the epidemics of the early
19th century, and continued to be used for the treatment of
diarrhoea and sickness, common complaints in the less <u>than </u>hygienic
environment of the day. It was during the Crimean war that the
analgesic effects were fully exploited, and it is certain that
the widespread use of laudanum, Collis Browne's mixture or other
opium-based medicines, available to the poor for a penny a
bottle, enabled ordinary people to cope with the harsh realities
of life in Dickensian England. From the government's point of
view, it was no doubt preferable to have the poor in a state of
comfortable stupor than rioting on the streets.<br>
</p>

<p>India was not the main source of opium for the domestic
market. Most of this was grown in Turkey or Persia (Iran), as
this opium was of generally high qualify, and trade flourished in
the period following the end of the Napoleonic wars, particularly
after the treaty of Balta Limon (1838) granting the Ottoman
Empire 'most favoured nation' trading status[2]. Indian opium,
however, was responsible for one of the British Government in
India becoming the largest drug-trafficking syndicate in the
world during the latter part of the century.<br>
</p>

<p>Opium and tea were the mainstays of the British East India
Company, who had a monopoly on the opium produced in Bengal. In
1772 Warren Hastings, then chief executive of the company,
realised the potential for foreign revenue in exporting Indian
opium to China. Opium had been known in China for centuries, but </p>

<p>imports bad been banned in 1729 by decree of the Emperor. An
foreign trade was funneled through Canton, opium being smuggled
with legitimate consignments in British ships, and sold through
corrupt officials to an eager market Other traders smuggled opium
to China overland, and the consumption spread to all levels of
society, even to the personal retinue of the Emperor. Exports to
China rose from 10,000 chests ill 1820 to 40,000 chests in 1840.
By 1836, a Chinese official in Canton, Hsu Nal-chi, petitioned
the emperor to legalise the trade after witnessing the failure of
prohibition... &quot;the severer the interdicts against (opium)
became, the more widely do the evils therefrom spread.&quot; He
was summarily dismissed from his post and replaced with a
committed &quot;war on drugs&quot;-minded individual, Lin
Tse-hsu.<br>
</p>

<p>Lin was determined to wipe out the opium trade by threatening
the British merchants with the loss of the tea trade, and in 1839
forced them to surrender 20,000 chests of the drug. Captain
Charles Elliot the British Chief Superintended, retaliated by
ordering all British ships out of the Canton estuary,
transferring the tea trade to American ships who would transport
their cargoes to Hong Kong, an inconvenience, but not an
obstacle, to the trade. Instead of using Canton, smugglers would
take opium consignments ashore up and down the coast in sinall
boats, fast enough to evade the Customs craft. Meanwhile Elliot
had ordered an expeditionary force of naval steamships which
arrived in 1840 and put direct pressure on Peking. Lin was
dismissed and the trade continued uninterrupted following the
Chinese capitulation and the end of the first opium war in 1842.
To the domestic audience in the UK, Palmerston, the Prime
Minister, bad portrayed the war as an attempt to force the
Chinese to accept free trade. In reality, the only commodity
directly involved was -opium, tax revenue from which was becoming
increasingly important to the Indian Government [3]. <br>
</p>

<p>In Britain, the Conservative opposition was not satisfied with
Palmerston's explanations and they opposed the opium trade in the
1840 Commons debate. By the time they took power in 1841 their
tune had changed, and the trade continued to expand. The Chinese
government was effectively warned that no British ships should be
searched. Although fresh edicts against the drug were issued by
the Chinese, they were powerless to stop the trade following the
treaty of Nanking, which ceded Hong Kong to Britain, allowing a
bridgehead for further opium supplies. In 1856, following growing
and-British sentiment, the Chinese gave the British government a
further excuse for war by seizing the <i>Arrow, </i>a British
vessel with a crew of Chinese criminals anchored off Canton. The
fact that the <i>Arrow's </i>registration had expired,
technically justifying the Chinese action, was overlooked by
Palmerston, once again the Liberal Prime Minister after fighting
an election forced by government defeat on an opposition motion
condemning the war, and winning on a wave of patriotic fervour.<br>
</p>

<p>Lord Elgin was dispatched with an expeditionary force which
burned down the Summer Palace in Peking to impress upon the
Emperor the need to keep agreements. The main consequence of the
Second Opium War was that China was forced to legalise the trade
in opium, and were only permitted to tax the product at a level
acceptable to the British. Consumption increased from 60,000
chests in 1860 to 105,000 by 1880. The trade generated taxes to
the British Indian Government equivalent to over half their total
revenue, enough to cover the entire civil service and armed
forces budgets. In this climate, financial expediency, as so
often is the case, took precedence over the growing moral
arguments against the drug trade. <br>
</p>

<p>Following increased public pressure to end the trade, and in
response to a Parliamentary motion, the Government called a Royal
Commission on the production and consumption of opium, which was
only to consider prohibition among other options, after full
investigation. It was during these manoevres that the IHDC was
also established. The Indian Viceroy, Lord Lansdowne was against
anything that might disrupt business. Prime Minister Gladstone
was much more pro trade than he was anti drug. They packed the
opium commission with pragmatists from the Indian Civil Service,
with some of the more economically literate abolitionists, and
ensured that it would concentrate a good deal on money. It first
met in September 1893 and saw 2,500 witnesses by February '94.<br>
</p>

<p>When the report was published in '95, it said that opium was
&quot;generally used in moderation&quot;, and &quot;led to no
evident ill-effects&quot;. Even some senior anti-opiumists had
been convinced. The fact that Chinese missionaries were
overwhelmingly critical of the effects of opium, in contrast to
the Indian witnesses who were predominantly favourable towards
the drug, was put down to the fact that in India the drug is
normally taken orally, whereas in China it was generally smoked
[3]. There was only one dissent; Joseph Rowntree, one of the
committee members, was later to denounce the Commission's report
as a whitewash. By that time there was another election under
way. Prohibition had no chance under the Conservatives, and there
would be no Liberal government until 1905.(4). The government,
despite public opinion, was determined to continue the opium<br>
</p>

<p><b>&quot;The Lunatic asylums are filled with Ganja
Smokers.&quot; <br>
</b></p>

<p>The question of cannabis occasionally cropped up as an
incidental issue in skirmishes during the long legislative battle
against the opium business. As early as 1840 the pro-opium banker
William Bingham Baring MP told the Commons that if the opium
trade were suppressed then there would be a danger of users
turning to drugs &quot;infinitely more prejudicial to physical
health and energy than opium&quot;. Baring, one of 10 MPs of both
parties from the same pro-free trade family, was particularly
concerned about &quot;an exhalation of the Hemp plant, easily
collected at certain seasons, which is in every way more
injurious than the use of the poppy.&quot; [3] This was another
justification for the lucrative opium trade which flourished in a
climate of official and unofficial governmental encouragement.
However, attitudes were slowly changing and in 1875 Mark Steward
MP had proposed that the Indian Governor General be instructed to
investigate the opium trade &quot;with a view to gradual
withdrawal,&quot; and lost by 37 votes. Similar moves were
regularly defeated for the next twenty years. By April '91, a
spokesman for the Society for Suppression of the Opium Trade
(SSOT) had obtained a 30-vote majority for a motion that the
Governments' revenue from opium was &quot;Morally
indefensible&quot;.<br>
</p>

<p>On 16 July 1891 Stewart asked a three part question about
ganja [5]:<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;i Whether the Secretary of State for India has seen a
report in the Allahabad Pioneer of 10 May that ganja, which is
grown sold and excised in much the same way as opium, is far more
harmful, and that &quot;the lunatic asylum of Bengal are filled
with ganja smokers.&quot; </p>

<p>ii Is he aware that<b> </b>ganja has been made illegal in
Lower Burma and that excise reports say this has been 'of
enormous benefit to the people.' </p>

<p>iii Will he call to the attention of the Governor General the
desirability of extending theprohibition to other
provinces?&quot; <br>
</p>

<p>The answers to which were yes, yes, and that he would
&quot;Enquire whether further steps should be taken to limit
consumption...&quot; On 7 August 1892 those enquiries were
answered at some length. The Viceroy's office told London that
the whole question had been extensively discussed with provincial
administrations in 1871-73. They sent 174 pages of old dispatches
from Indian provincial governments to the centre, and from there
to London. After considering these, &quot;The Governor General is
of the opinion that while ganja may be among the most noxious of
all intoxicants commonly used in India... even if absolute
prohibition could be enforced, the result might be to induce the
use of more noxious drugs&quot; (e.g. datura). Apart from which
it would be impossible to enforce a prohibition. It was &quot;Our
duty to restrict consumption, but unnecessary to do more than
persevere in the policy established In 1873.&quot; These papers
languished unread in London, perhaps because there was a general
election going on.<br>
</p>

<p>The 1873 dispatches showed the pragmatism of imperial
administrators which was to be repeated by the IHDC, in very
similar words. The then Viceroy had said that while the
Government should endeavour to restrict the use of ganja, it
would be impossible to enforce general prohibition, especially
because of religious feelings in some groups and because the
plants grew freely some areas. It would be inexpedient to order
what could not be enforced... &quot;It does not appear to the
Governor-General to be specifically proved that hump incites to
crime more than other drugs or spirits.&quot; There was also some
evidence that hump, &quot;usually so noxious&quot;, might
usefully be taken for medical reasons. There was no doubt that
habitual use tended to cause insanity but not in very many cases
relative to the numbers of the insane.(6]. &quot;General opinion
seems to be that the evil effects of Ganja have been
exaggerated.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p>The dispatches from regional governments were more forthright.
The Lt.-Governor of the Punjab wrote that considering the
practicalities, they should not restrict hemp drug use unless
there was proof of connection with crime. Civil, police and
medical officers disagreed on the details but: &quot;His Honour
is of the opinion that if people were prohibited from using
preparations of hemp or opium, they would, in all probability,
have recourse to some other stimulant, such as alcohol, the crime
resulting from the use of which would be much greater than that
resulting from the abuse of these drugs .... It seems that the
amount of crime, violent or other, incited by ganja, is
exceedingly small... If, therefore, these preparations have no
effect on crime and only injure the persons who use them, it is
difficult to see in what manner the law can restrict their use in
a country where opium is a monopoly of the Government, the
effects of which are perhaps as injurious when taken in excess as
those of hemp.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>The local governments of Mysore, Hyderbad, Oudh, and Burma
said that as hump drugs were little used locally, not necessary.
Central Provinces sent plenty of data but no opinions. The
Northwest Provinces (later Pakistan), one of the main cannabis
growing areas, said the evidence on crime was confused, where if
the situation was bad as supposed there would surely be a
consensus. To stop production would be almost impossible, so they
could not recommend attempts to limit or stop consumption.
Bombay, Madras, and Bengal said that restrictions and taxes
already in place should be preserved. All agreed excessive use to
be somehow connected with physical harm and perhaps insanity, but
the numbers harmed were very small. Bengal sent the most
information. Asked if a particularly popular type of local ganja
was more deleterious than others, they submitted a long report on
cultivation, uses and profit margins on all hemp products by Dr
Watt, State Reporter on Economic Products. Their local product
was popular due to the quality of plants and traditional
production skills, rather than sheer strength. A table of samples
analysed for &quot;Resinous extracts or Cannabin&quot; ranged
from 1.4% (NW Province) to 12% (Madras), mostly about 4% [7]. All
of the legal trade was inside India. The state of Bengal had been
making an average 1 million rupees per year through the 1860's in
tax on ganja shops and duty at government auctions, about
100,000 - tens of millions in today's money.<br>
</p>

<p>When these papers were taken from the files, twenty years
after they were written, the August 1892 elections were under
way. The Conservatives went out and the Liberals came in. Drug
control was not high on their agenda; however, the new Home
Secretary, Foreign Secretary, and Secretary of State for India
were all known to be anti-opium, and the Prime Minister had
spoken out against it in the past. The prohibitionists knew they
might get some sort of opium control agreed if it didn't oppose
the Liberals' central Free Trade policy. Believing their moment
had come, they began to quarrel among themselves.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Criminalise it!<br>
</b></p>

<p>Before the development of the hypodermic syringe by Alexander
Wood, the main concern about opium was not the threat of
addiction, but the danger of poisoning. Only after the 1860s did
the risk of dependency start to cause concern among the medical
profession. Certainly, people would have been habituated to the
drug, but the stereotype of the drug addict had yet to gain
acceptance within the UK. Even where individuals wrote of their
habit, such as a chemists wife who had been using morphia for 30
years, described her experience in a matter of fact way, free
from any sense of stigma her major concern being the perceived
tendency of the drug to cause her to put on weight. Although the
dependency syndrome had been described two centuries earlier by
Thomas Sydenham, the risk was not taken seriously by most medical
practitioners. Following increasing reports of dependency
symptoms after 1860, culminating in a series of articles in <i>The
Practitioner </i>in<i> </i>1870, the debate on the wisdom of
permitting free access to opium accelerated. In 1878 Edward
Levinstein in Germany started the 'moral' argument about the
effect of opium on the character of the user, and was one of the
first to promote abstinence as a cure for the addict [2].<br>
</p>

<p>From the 1840s on, there were several anti-opium
organisations, all small and mostly broke. Their memberships
overlapped, but the leaders didn't get on well. None of them had
ever tried to gain mass support. The first organisation to come
out against the trade were the Birmingham Quakers. In 1869, Lord
Shaftesbury urged the Indian government to withdraw from its
monopoly position in the trade. By 1884 the Society for the Study
and Cure of Inebriety, founded by Sir Norman Kerr, aimed &quot;to
educate the professional and the public mind to the dangers of
intemperance&quot;. At that time, alcohol was the main target for
the temperance movement, whereas other, more exotic drugs were
not seen as much of a threat to respectable Britons. These drugs
were not expected to be a threat to the well-adjusted British
gentleman, and habituation among the Chinese and others was
regarded as the kind of 'filthy foreign habit' that should be
stopped for the foreigners' own good. Kerr recognised the dangers
of opium with a crusading zeal, and railed against its use,
denying any possibility that some persons could be able to
restrict their use to a moderate level. The Society for
Suppression of the Opium Trade (SSOT), founded in 1874, became
the best-known anti-opium organisation, but had always been
elitist, controlled by Quaker businessmen with knighthoods,
funded by one family. Their best argument combined economic and
humanitarian interest; other exports to China had been damaged by
the sleaziness of the opium business. Trade with China had been
stagnant between 1860-80 while business with Japan had tripled.
The SSOT moved for ending the India-China opium trade, and an
enquiry into alternate ways of making up the money. They took too
long agreeing a proposal with other lobbyists, but did manage to
force the government to concede the 1893 Royal Commission on
Opium [8].<br>
</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in February '93, William Caine, MP (Bradford East),
had the papers on ganja collected the previous year placed in the
House of Commons Library. 0u the 2nd March 1893 he put a public
question to the Under-secretary of State for India. &quot;If he
will instruct the Government of India to create a commission of
experts to enquire into and report on the cultivation of and
trade in all preparations of hemp drugs in Bengal, the effects of
theft consumption on society, and on the moral condition of the
people, and the desirability of prohibiting its growth and
sale.&quot; Would he also invite written reports on the same
matters from all other provinces, and include in the commission
non-official natives of India. The Secretary of State would ask
the Viceroy to do just that, &quot;and he will be glad if the
result of this inquiry is to show that further restriction can be
placed upon the sale and consumption of these drugs.&quot;(7)
Since the Government seemed so amenable, a secondary question by
the Right Hon. Sir Charles E. Schwann, Bart, was then dropped.<br>
</p>

<p>The members of the commission were named on 3rd July, and held
their first meeting on 2nd August - a mouth before the Opium
commission began to meet. They continued until April, seeing over
800 witnesses, assembling over 3000 pages into seven volumes, and
a confidential extra volume on hemp drug use in the Army; then
the Finance and Commerce department of the Government of India
considered the report, and another British election crept closer.
It is unclear what Caine and Schwann thought they were up to.
Both were Liberals, Temperance campaigners, and probably
anti-opium. Schwann had a safe scat, a comfortable merchants'
fortune and radical opinions. Caine wrote books, including 'Young
India', 'Picturesque India' and 'A Trip Around the World.' He had
quit the Liberal Party six years earlier over the Irish question,
and been re-admitted in a new scat after losing as an
Independent; he was to lose it again in 1895. The timing, and the
request for the commission to include non-official Indians,
suggest that they were part of a faction among the
anti-opiumists, perhaps trying to stir them into holder demands
or quicker action. Perhaps they were simply trying to get in on
what looked like a winning side. Neither is recorded as ever
mentioning hemp drugs in public again.<br>
</p>

<p><b>The Dope Fiends of Old England<br>
</b></p>

<p>The international drugs trade was quite a different thing from
home consumption; for example although the British Empire
produced a great deal of the worlds' opiates, over 80% of the
opium used in the UK was from Turkey and Persia [2]. The economic
pressure for international prohibition came from traders and
nations with rival products. In the UK drug control was at first
pan of an increase in medical involvement in social policy.
Prescription by professionals had to take over from
self-medication before complete prohibition became possible.<br>
</p>

<p>There was not much openly recreational drug use in Victorian
England, other than alcohol. A few serf consciously
unconventional young artists and mystics searched for inner
experience, rejecting vulgar materialism, but the majority of
drug abusers, then as now, considered themselves to be taking
medicines, to help them work or relax. This was an age which
demanded refinement, in every sense of the term. They took
extracts, tinctures, distillations or the 'active ingredients' of
traditional medicinal plants like Indian hemp or poppies, in
amounts that would kill modern addicts. This was all for the good
of their health, so morally impeccable. They didn't do dope to
get wasted, or didn't admit to it<br>
</p>

<p>Vulgar materialism provided ever more purified forms of relief
from the stresses of righteous life, as opium was dissolved into
laudanum, concentrated into morphine, re-concentrated into
heroin. Some condemned booze while chewing opium, just as
well-known modern anti-drug campaigners have been tranquilliser
addicts. In this atmosphere Cannabis Indica was just another
potentially useful plant, which could be perhaps refined into
some sort of medicine but was quite unsuitable in natural form.
The distinction between drug use and abuse had hardly been
invented. Doctors were expensive and not well trusted, so the
poor dosed themselves with whatever remedies they could afford.
Pseudo-medical opiate use was decreasing, but still respectable;
Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Florence Nightingale had used it,
and William Wilberforce, saint of the anti-slavery movement, had
eaten twelve grains a day for thirty years. Self-medication
bluffed into non-medical use. Boozing was low class and
unfeminine, so respectable ladies took &quot;tonics.&quot; Patent
medicines were a huge business, often including alcohol, opium,
or cannabis.<br>
</p>

<p>Sales of pure morphine, cocaine, and barbiturates were
supposedly controlled by the 1868 Poisons and Pharmacy Act, but
quack nostrums and patent medicines were not, and an attempt to
extend the law in 1884 had failed. The Act only affected shops,
not users. One especially dangerous popular remedy was Collis
Brownes' Chlorodyne, containing chloroform and morphine, which
the British Medical Association campaigned through the 90's to
have banned.<br>
</p>

<p><b>&quot;One of the most valuable medicines we possess&quot; <br>
</b></p>

<p>There had been increasing medical interest in cannabis since
William O'Shaughnessy described the use of indian hemp as
medicine and intoxicant [9], relying on accounts of hashish use
from ancient Persian and Arabic sources, as well as on his own
observations in India. He described the use of hemp in the
treatment of rheumatism, hydrophobia, cholera, tetanus and
infantile convulsions, as well as describing the delirium induced
by continued use. O'Shaughnessy had written in 1839 that, with a
couple of exceptions, &quot;I have been unable to trace any
notice of the employment of this drug in Europe.&quot; However,
despite citing western works by Ainslie and von Estebeck he
managed to overlook one classic account. <br>
</p>

<p>The noted medieval herbalist, Nicholas Culpepper (1616-1654),
listed a variety of medical uses of the common european hemp
(Cannabis sativa), including anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and
antiparasitic activity [10]. Culpepper made no mention of the
psychotropic activity, although the temperate hemp he described
would normally be of low drug content and be grown for fibre.
Culpepper's work would have owed much to the folk herbalism used
by British witches, or wise women, who until the christian
persecutions had provided most primary health care to the rural
population, as well as to the monastic healers who replaced them.
By the Victorian &quot;age of reason&quot; most traditional use
had been suppressed, as the pioneer pharmacologists began to
analyse folk medicines to refine and extract the active compounds
therein. An unsuccessful attempt had been made in the 1840's to
grow hemp for medicine in the London suburb of Mitcham.
Experimenters used it for athsma and other chest problems,
sleeplessness especially in cases of opiate or alcohol
withdrawal, and with opium and bromide of potassium in treating
insanity.<br>
</p>

<p>One reason why cannabis was not as widely used as opium
products, or the newer chemical remedies, was the difficulty
found refining an &quot;active ingredient.&quot; There were
problems getting supplies of reliable strength, confusion about
apparently different products from the same plant, and
uncertainty about its effects in the body. However, it was used
to treat many disorders. In 1889, Dr E.A.Birch described in the
Lancet the successful use of cannabis indica in the treatment of
chloral hydrate and opium withdrawal, drawing attention to the
abolition of craving and the antiemetic (vomit suppressing)
effects and the stimulation of appetite in patients who would not
normally eat, or keep down, their food [111. Queen Victoria's
personal physician, J.R. Reynolds described it in 1890 as
&quot;One of the most valuable medicines we possess.&quot; In
another Lancet article published in 1890, he described the use of
cannabis indica for treating insomnia in the senile, alcoholic
delirium, neuralgia, migraine, spastic paralysis, and convulsions
[12]..He allegedly prescribed tincture of cannabis to Queen
Victoria herself for the treatment of menstrual cramps. Cannabis
tincture and an extract made from resin were available from Peter
Squire of Oxford St in 1864, and wholesale through the Society of
Apothecaries by 1871. Chemists extracted stuff they called
cannabene, cannabin tannin, cannabinnene etc. but had no idea
which, if any, was the &quot;active ingredient&quot; until
cannabinol was isolated in 1895. <br>
</p>

<p>At the same time some thought of drug-taking as a form of
poisoning, and some researchers proposed that it either caused,
or was, a type of insanity. W.W. Ireland compared the mental
state of cannabis users to delirium, with its alteration of time
and space and visual illusions. British doctors' reports from
Cairo Asylum in 1894 linked violent insanity with
&quot;Hashism&quot;(13,14) Some of the medical studies would have
been recreational use in any other context. Walter Dixon must
have tried it on himself as well as small furry animals when he
showed in 1899 that the effects vary according to type of
preparation as well as method of ingestion. He recommended
smoking for immediate effect and wrote in the British Medical
Journal, &quot;Hemp taken as an inhalation may be placed in the
same category as coffee, tea and kola. It is not dangerous and
its effects are never alarming, and I have come to regard it in
this form as a useful and refreshing stimulant and food
accessory, and one whose use does not lead to a habit which grows
upon its votary.&quot; He was to be a member of the Rolleston
Committee on Morphine and Heroin Addiction in the 1920's, who
opposed criminalising narcotics policy.<br>
</p>

<p>At the end of the century cannabis tincture became popular
again as a cure for cramps, migraine, opium addiction, withdrawal
and insomnia, but the fashion faded. In the early 1900's a
British Medical Association campaign against 'Secret Remedies'
got most of the opiates, cocaine and cannabis out of tonics and
non-prescription medicines. Doctors became responsible for most
drug distribution as the consumer beverage trade withdrew. As
drag dispensing was professionalised, substances used for
self-medication were replaced by more refined, more medically
controllable drags. The Indian Hemp Drugs Commission report made
no apparent difference to this at all, and it's quite possible
that nobody in the medical establishment read it. It held quite a
lot of scientific data but its purpose had been political rather
than medical. The political and economic interests of the British
Medical Association were quite different from those of the
Government of India.<br>
</p>

<p><b>The Cosmopolitan Dope Fiends<br>
</b></p>

<p>It is worth noting that most publications from the time refer
to &quot;Hashish,&quot; the Arabic term, Indian Hemp, or
Cannabis, rather than Charas, Ganja or Bhang, the Hindi names.
The French empire in North Africa had at least as much effect on
European cannabis use as the British empire in India. A certain
style of drug use, the Wasted Artist role, as established by the
laudanum swigging Coleridge and De Quincey early in the century,
was revived by Dr Jean Moreau in Paris after 1845. The doctor,
who experimented with hashish to treat insanity, founded the Club
des Hashishins with the writer Theophile Gautier, for non-medical
experiments. Some of the members were quite keen on a little
delirium. Gautier was a hack with brilliant friends, an 'art for
arts sake' romantic with a taste for macabre fantasy who
encouraged the Symbolist poets. Rimbaud and Verlaine shared his
drugs. Baudelaire dedicated &quot;Fleur du Mal&quot; to him, and
wrote an essay that explained their attitudes: &quot;On Hashish
and Wine as a means of expanding individuality.&quot; They
created strange, sensuous art, struck foreign poses based on
their beliefs about the romantic East, scandalised bourgeois
society [15].<br>
</p>

<p>By the 90's the club had imitators in London. If there was no
recreational drug use &quot;subculture&quot; in the 1890's, <b>one
</b>network came close. This was the circle of poets, psychics,
writers and would-be magicians around the Rhymers Club and the
Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. They didn't define their
connection by shared drug use, but they certainly included drug
experiments in their self-definition. Occult studies, drugs,
hypnotism, proto-psychiatry and new styles of arts were all
1890's fashions mingled in overlapping cliques in central London.
The Golden Dawn was established in 1888 by some occultist
Freemasons, as a society of &quot;Christian practiced magic. In
1890 Yeats and two others formed the Rhymers Club as a sort of
literary wing, drawing inspiration from the French Symbolists.
None of the Rhymers Club apart from Yeats ever achieved as much
recognition as their French heroes, but they had the style. They
were melancholy, self-dramatising, they hoped Byronic. They had
doomed love lives and nervous breakdowns, and mostly died young.
Their defiance of conventional society included such un-English
deviance as drinking black coffee and speaking comprehensible
French, as well as attempted magic, sexual permutations not
discussed in polite company, and hefty drug use.<br>
</p>

<p>Yeats and his lover Maude Gonne tried using hashish to improve
their telepathic powers. Others had a more relaxed, recreational
approach. Arthur Symons was one Rhymer who survived to he
described as &quot;highly strong, over-sensitive&quot; in the
1930's, best known for &quot;Confessions - A study in
Pathology&quot; which described his two years in an Italian
lunatic asylum and cure by near-fatal pneumonia in 1909. He was
the author of 'The Opium Smoker; &quot;I am engulfed, and drown
deliciously/soft music like a perfume, and sweet light/Golden
with audible odours exquisite/ swathe me in cerements for
eternity.../&quot;. In a biography of fellow Rhymer Ernest Dowson
he described one afternoon; a couple of ballet dancers and a poet
visiting, the host issuing tea, cakes, cigarettes and then
hashish. &quot;That slow intoxication, that elaborate experiment
in visionary sensations... he sat awaiting the magic, half shy in
the midst of that bright company of young people.&quot; Dowson
wrote poems with Latin titles <b>about </b>doomed love affairs,
and consorted with the &quot;most degraded&quot; women in
dockside dives. He experimented with mescal in 1896, with the
sexuality researcher Havelock Ellis. He died of TB in 1900, aged
32. The other poet present at the hash and tea party and the
mescal experiment was John Addington Symonds, a historian who
studied the criminal mentality - he was part blinded after
several breakdowns and TB. One of their associates, Count Eric
Stenbock, who wrote The Shadow of Death and Studies of Death, was
known for wearing a live snake around his neck; he died aged 35,
of either alcohol or opium.(13)<br>
</p>

<p>The Wasted Artists were picturesque and dramatic, and their
style became a popular image of drug abusers. Ethereal and rather
unhealthy, possibly creative but definitely pasty-faced. The
perception of a difference between drugs suitable for legitimate
use, under medical control, and drugs which can only be abused,
was extended by their example; anything they took was obviously
not doing any good for their health. Still there was no anti-drug
panic in the UK. Drugs were still seen as foreign stuff, only
used by those who wanted to act like foreigners. The artists were
added to an existing mythology of the opium addict and the opium
den, spread by popular fiction from Wilkie Collins to Oscar
Wilde, the addict over-sensitive, hollow-cheeked with torment,
the dens glided in rococo brothel style, populated by vicious
Chinese and degenerate aristocrats.<br>
</p>

<p><b>The Respectable Fear begins<br>
</b></p>

<p>The first demon dope stories came over from the USA in the mid
1890's. There were, apparently, ever-increasing numbers of Black
men with cocaine, Chinese with opium, and Mexicans with both,
plus marijuana. These coloured men were allegedly using their
fiendish substances to gain the flesh of white women, and many of
them would go crazy with big knives if frustrated in any way. The
British media only retold a few of these tales <b>at </b>first.
The pathological imagination of the US Press kept it up for the
next forty years, changing the drug and the villains' colour now
and again. Heroin was refined in 1898 but for the first few years
it was considered a miracle painkiller and cure for morphine
addiction. The subject of the grossest stories was cocaine, also
considered a miracle cure a few years earlier. The medical
enthusiasts didn't think it suitable for recreational use. The
recreational users disagreed. The alcohol prohibitionists built a
mass following and inflicted a huge social disaster on the USA.
When the alcohol ban was repealed, drug control was not. The
myths were retired for a few years, but similar stories can be
found, only slightly less racist, in the mass media today.<br>
</p>

<p>Before, during and after Prohibition, the USA lobbied for
international drugs laws, mixing economic self-interest with
moralism. The Hague Conference in 1912 agreed to the principle of
certain drugs being strictly for &quot;legitimate medical
purposes.&quot; It was never effective internationally because of
obstruction by the British opiate and German cocaine businesses.
The conference suggested an investigation of hemp, but it wasn't
followed up. The Assam Opium &amp; Ganja Committee of 1913(16)
showed that the IHDC had been forgotten or ignored in that
province of India, for instance accepting that ganja causes
insanity without calling any evidence. It did say that when ganja
prices rose users turned to opium, when opium prices rose they
turned to alcohol or, alarmingly, morphine. The number of
licensed shops in Assam had fallen from 1116 in 1878 to 347 in
1911, and the committee thought it couldn't be reduced further
without provoking unrest.<br>
</p>

<p>Recreational drug use in British literary circles in the '90s
spread through the next two decades into a wider worlds. Cocaine
use had spread well into the upper class by the First World War.
Officialdom grew concerned about officers on leave, who often
weren't afraid to wreck their health since their chances of
survival were slim. Morale would not be improved, it was felt, by
the sight of the upper ranks behaving like beasts, and it would
be worse yet if the common soldiers imitated them. There was a
press scare about the Germans using drugs and prostitutes,
collecting blackmail material. This unlikely tale and other
stories of moral degeneracy caught the imagination of the Army
Council, who banned the sale of all intoxicants to troops in mid
1916. In July the first U K law against possession of drags was
sneaked through, section 40B of the Defense of the Realm Act. It
covered cocaine and opiates; cannabis was not included, although
it had been considered. Section 40B also banned
&quot;Malththusian appliances&quot; (contraception) and quack
medicines. The same Act established legal closing times for pubs,
which caused a lot more fuss.<br>
</p>

<p><b>The post war scandal boom<br>
</b></p>

<p>Immediately after the Great War the British press got their
first US-style dope story. Actress Billie Carelton, age 21, died
supposedly from cocaine taken at an alcohol-free Victory Ball.
Her supplier was tried for manslaughter but could not be
convicted. It was just as likely the sleeping drug Veronal that
killed her, but that didn't bother the Daily Express. They
included hashish eating in the habits of a circle of degenerates
who, they said, had mined a sweet and innocent girl. In September
1920 a Dangerous Drugs Act was passed, clarifying the wartime
possession law and effectively dividing the drug trade into
medical vs criminal. It was greeted with such apathy by
Parliament <u>that </u>it was hard to make up a quorum in some of
the committees. Cannabis was still not banned.<br>
</p>

<p>Internationally, the UK government stopped blocking drug
controls after several scandals at home and reports that morphine
and cocaine addiction were spreading in the colonies. There were
more sex drugs and foreigner stories to keep up the postwar drug
scare. In 1922 the death of dancer Freda Kempton gained unwanted
publicity for Brilliant Chang, Chinese restaurant owner and
alleged dope king since 1917, handling morphine, opium and
hashish as well as cocaine. After many raids and mentions in the
press he was sentenced to 14 months - not much for such an
alleged villain - then departed in 1924. Eddie Manning, Jamaican
jazz drummer and alleged dope king, was convicted of dealing
opium and cocaine in '23. Both, it was strongly implied, had used
their dealing to get close to English girls. In 1922 three
sisters were found half dressed and unconscious in the company of
a dead Chinese man, Yee Sing a.k.a. Johnny Hop, in a sealed room
full of opium smoke above a Cardiff laundry. The girls never told
quite what had happened, so the press made it up, including a
Chinese love potion made from hashish used especially to subdue
white women, with an antidote made from geraniums.(17) Pulp
fiction by the likes of Sax Rohmer helped spread the corrupt
aristocrat and Chinese dope plot themes.<br>
</p>

<p>Despite all this advertisement, there was still no working
class drug subculture. The upmarket drug users of the 20's
continued to be found where the overlap between high society and
the arts copied what were seen as American fashions for jazz and
cocaine. Aleister Crowleys' 1922 novel, Diary of a Drug Fiend,
thinly disguised a real West End scene where cocaine was dealt in
the Cafe Royal on Regent Sweet. Crowley was a former Golden Dawn
member who publicised himself as &quot;The Wickedest Man in the
World,&quot; and ran a black magic cult largely based on sex. He
occasionally kicked his morphine habit cold turkey in front of
acolytes, to show the power of his will; he did quite a lot to
establish a link in the public mind between heavy drug use and
being a dangerous but pretentious creep. Chloroform and morphine
were popular with Lady Diana Cooper and Katherine Asquith, models
for several wild aristos in fiction. Morphine might be risky and
maybe immoral, but boozing was common, which was much worse.
Compared to these types cannabis users were sweethearts. Having
previously tried smoking it to no effect, the painter Augustus
John tried a hashish compote or jam after sardines and wine with
friends in Hampstead; &quot;...catching the eye of Iris, we were
both simultaneously seized with uncontrollable laughter, about
nothing at all...&quot; Despite the publicity, and penalties
increasing in 1922, prosecutions under the Dangerous Drugs Act
averaged a steady 60 a year for cocaine, 65 for opium. <br>
</p>

<p>Cannabis lust became illegal in the UK after the country
agreed the 1925 Geneva International Convention on Narcotics
Control. It was included in the '25 Convention with the opiates
and cocaine, because Egypt and Turkey proposed it. An Egyptian
delegate stirringly denounced &quot;Chronic Hashism&quot; which
he said caused most of the insanity in his country. It also, he
said, weakened users, gave them heart and digestive troubles and
made them look wild-eyed and stupid. India opposed including
cannabis in the Convention, as their delegate said it had been
used there since time immemorial, grew wild, and they doubted
that a prohibition could enforced. The British delegate abstained
from the vote but signed in the end. There was hardly any
parliamentary debate before it came into law as amendments to the
Dangerous Drugs Act on 281h September 1928. Despite this cannabis
offences, and 206 for opium. In 1950 for the first time there
were more prosecutions for cannabis than for opium and
manufactured drugs together - 86 against 41 opium and 42 others.
That year a series of police raids on jazz clubs produced a new
crop of stories about black men with drugs and white women, this
time involving marijuana and benzedrine. Cannabis had finally got
into the shock horror league.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Epilogue<br>
</b></p>

<p>The Indian Hemp Drugs Commission finally had its moment in
Parliament in July 1967, after the Government had established an
Advisory Committee on Drug Dependence. J.J.S. Driberg, Chief of
Police and Inspector of Prisons for Assam, had given gave
evidence to the IHDC. His son Tom was a Labour MP. According to
his autobiography [18], the poet Alan Ginsberg asked Tom to
&quot;look up for him the report... in the House library I found
that my father had given evidence before this commission, putting
forward strongly the view that people living in a damp, cold
climate<u> </u>needed the traditional consolation of ganja... The
climate referred to was that of Assam, rather than England; but I
felt it was almost an act of filial piety to sign a full page
advertisement in the Times calling for a liberalisation of the
laws on pot...&quot; When it became obvious that there would be
no liberalisation, be attacked the government, his own party, in
the parliamentary debate. He said his father had told the IHDC
that when insane people were arrested a form had to be filled
saying why they were insane, and the safest thing to say was
ganja as the police knew that no further enquiry would be made.
When the government spokeswoman asked rhetorically &quot;What
sort of society will we create if everyone wants to escape from
reality 7&quot; Driberg answered that &quot;They want to escape
from this horrible society we have created.&quot; The 1968 Wooton
Committee on Cannabis was &quot;in agreement with the conclusions
reached by the IHDC... that the long-term consumption of cannabis
in moderate doses has no harmful effects.&quot; Given wide
publicity, the government couldn't completely to ignore this new
study; instead they did exactly the opposite of what it
recommended, and increased penalties for all cannabis offences in
a new 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act. Cannabis use continued to
increase dramatically. By 1990 there were 40,194 convictions and
cautions for cannabis in the UK, well over 90% of all recorded
drugs crimes.<br>

<H2>Digital Approach to Seabed Classification</H2>
Currently, high speed digital signal processors can extract many features from an echo sounder signal. Quester Tangent's QTC VIEW digitizes and processes the signal providing  an accurate, repeatable seafloor classification.
<p>
Information is displayed as a colour representing seafloor class along the vessel's track.  Depth is calculated and portrayed as a bottom profile along the track with class color superimposed.  The QTC VIEW also generates 3 values representing each echo's description and when displayed in 3-D, the user can identify relationships between the seabed classes.
<P>

The QTC VIEW approach to classification of the seafloor has a variety of applications.  The system is currently used in marine biological research  for seabed habitat assessment,  in large scale survey work supporting emplacement of seafloor engineering facilities related to off-shore oil and gas production and in the dredging industry for aggregate evaluation.

<STRONG>A real-time accurate assessment of clearance
between the vessel keel and the seabed</STRONG>
<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>

Incorporating over a decade of field-proven marine technology, Quester Tangent's Under Keel Clearance Guide (UKCG) provides status information for the safe and efficient management of port operations. The UKCG system receives data from the Vessel Traffic Management System (VTMS) and other oceanographic and meteorological sensors, to provide information, planning tools and emergency alarms. 
<P>
As port operations become increasingly competitive, there is a growing need for more accessible, detailed and accurate port and waterway information by ship operators, VTMS operators and vessel pilots.  Traditionally operators and pilots have relied on tide tables, paper or electronic charts, and a history of local knowledge when determining vessel clearance safety or planning berthing procedures.  These predictions may not take into account day to day changes due to depth, current, tide and weather.
<P>
The UKCG integrates bathymetry, weather, tide, current and vessel squat to predict vessel under keel clearance information for the particular port or waterway.  By integrating this data, the UKCG is used as a forecast tool and alarm system alongside the VTMS. The operator receives an accurate assessment of vessel under keel clearance usingoptimal and real-time data based on accurate forecast and now-cast information<P>


<H3>DESIGN:</H3>
A schematic of a typical UKCG system is shown in Figure 1 which details the operational flow of data to and from the VTMS.  The UKCG system operates in parallel with the VTMS and can receive, process and transmit data to the VTMS operator displays.<P>

<CENTER> <IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="graphics/keel1.gif" alt=" "><BR>
<STRONG>Figure 1   UKCG - VTMS Network Configuration</STRONG></CENTER>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<STRONG>Digital Tidal Atlas (DTA):</STRONG><BR>
The DTA accepts requests for water depth and current information from the VTMS to provide real-time and forecast conditions for the port or specific vessel routes. The DTA's tidal predictor is based on a 3-D finite element model tuned and run in the port area.  Adjustments due to weather effects incorporate seasonal variations in water density, actual wind velocity and air pressure.  Data  from permanently installed and strategically placed sensors, such as Doppler current meters and tide gauges is used to validate water depth and water column current forecasts within the DTA.<P>
<STRONG>Squat Predictor (Squat):</STRONG><BR>
The Squat Predictor utilizes water depth and current information, bathymetric data, vessel hull shape information, and actual or forecast speed heading and draught information to predict the vessel draught increase due to its motion through the water. <P>
<STRONG>Under Keel Clearance (UKCG):</STRONG><BR>
The UKCG processes the information and forecasts the vessel's under keel clearance  while providing a confidence level indication.
The now-cast and forecast information is validated by tide and current information from the on-line sensors in the port area. VTMS operators may request information on water depth, current speed and clearance parameters using a graphics interface technology supported by on-line help, alarm and status indicators. Water column currents, surface currents and  time series of currents are displayed for any position in the port region, as well as current information over a  geographic region of interest.<P>
<CENTER> <IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="graphics/keel2.gif" alt=" "><BR>
<STRONG>Figure 2 UKCG System Design</STRONG></CENTER>
<BR CLEAR=ALL> 

Other information  available from the UKCG system are planning and real-time monitoring tools. For example, &quot;Cross Flow Over Route&quot; is a forecast of the currents across a planned route. &quot;Clearance Over Route&quot; is a graphic display of the forecast clearance as a function of time and position along the planned route. In addition, as the vessel transits the route, real-time positions and speed provide a real-time clearance forecast. This forecast also includes an alarm system for potentially hazardous situations.<P>
The &quot;Safe Passage Window&quot; and &quot;Clearance During Loading&quot; functions are used in rapid investigation of trade-offs, such as increasing cargo with a delayed sailing versus a quicker departure with less cargo.  
<P>
Future enhancements of the UKCG system include installations with remote laptop computers and communication links to the VTMS.  Onboard pilots will have instant access to real-time under keel clearance information.


<P>
The UKCG system can be used in a &quot;stand alone&quot; configuration or integrated into a new or existing VTMS.  The integration of forecast and real-time data, combined with sophisticated mathematical and physical models, allows the system to provide detailed forecast and now-cast tools for the specific port.  Graphical displays show forecasted under keel clearances for a vessel as it transits its route.  Other tools allow for quick analysis of &quot;safe&quot; vessel draught conditions of vessels while loading or entering the port using actual current, tide and vessel speed conditions. 
<P>
The UKCG operators access real-time and forecast prediction information which is used in conjunction with the planning tools, and to assist in making decisions to enhance safe and economical port operations. This information is particularly valuable in ports with limited clearance, strong currents or where lightering operations are required. Berthing and loading operations are optimized and safety enhanced utilizing UKCG forecasts to provide safe transit &quot;windows&quot; and tools that can be used in emergencies.  The UKCG system displays forecast clearance on the vessel's route, allowing the operator to make decisions regarding vessel loading, planned draught, departure times and route selection.

<H2>An Under Keel Clearance Guide for Ports and Waterways</H2>


<H4>Paul Lacroix and James Kightley<BR>

Sidney, British Columbia, Canada</H4>

<H3>Abstract</H3>
The Under Keel Clearance Guide (UKCG) is a new element in a modern VTMS system. The UKCG integrates bathymetry, weather and sophisticated tide, current and squat models to provide predictive vessel clearance information. Operating on a networked work station, it provides both real-time and forecast products and planning tools to the user. It is able to display forecast clearance along a route and allows trade-offs to be made during loading, regarding planned draught, departure time and route selection.<P>
<H3>Introduction</H3>
As ports and waterways infrastructure becomes more integrated, ship operators, port operators and pilots are requiring that more information be available on-line and on-demand.  This article describes a new element of a Vessel Traffic Management System (VTMS) which is providing, among other products, water depth, water column current and vessel under keel clearance. Integrating a number of technologies for the first time, this system provides information for any area in the port or waterway, including forecast information for a 12 hour period.
At present, vessel operators and pilots rely upon tide tables, paper or electronic charts, and local knowledge to determine acceptable draughts for vessels, and to plan berthing procedures. While reliable, these sources of information are not optimal, and cannot easily take account of day to day changes. While tidal effects dominate water column current and depth, other non-tidal effects can be quite significant. The technology described here incorporates these effects to improve capabilities to forecast water depths, currents, and under keel clearance in the port area.<P>
The Under Keel Clearance Guide (UKCG) is based upon accurate forecast and now-cast water depth and current information. It integrates vessel hull shape, speed and other information to provide a forecast tool and alarm system component of the VTMS. The technology is delivered as a work station that runs database and modeling software, and delivers reports through an easy to use Graphical User Interface (GUI).<P>
This technology helps to optimize berthing and loading operations, while enhancing safety. As described below, forecasts of safe transit windows are routinely provided and tools for emergencies are available. The technology offers significant advantages in ports with draught limitations or strong currents, and also those ports with lightering operations.  <P>
The Under Keel Clearance Guide is an integration of technologies from several disciplines.  A sophisticated Digital Tidal Atlas (DTA) is a major module.  This atlas, with integrated wind, air pressure and water density elements, is derived from decades of research by oceanographers working in coastal regions.  The vessel squat model is a second key element.  Finally, accurate digital bathymetry with tools for validation and editing is a third essential module.  To be useful, this system can be delivered as an integral part of a VTMS.  Operating as part of a Local Area Network, the Under Keel Clearance Guide accepts data from the VTMS system as well as from other oceanographic and meteorological sensors, and provides status information, planning tools, and emergency alarms. Alternatively, the system can operate as a stand-alone unit alongside existing port information systems. <P>
The implementation described here is supplied by Quester Tangent as an element of a VTMS system being delivered by Lockheed Martin to a major oil port.<P>
<H3>System Design</H3>
The design of the Under Keel Clearance Guide is described in terms of the flow charts shown as Figures 1, 2, and 3.  For example, the Digital Tidal Atlas Predictor (DTA) accepts requests for water depth or current information from the system, and provides actual and forecast conditions throughout the port or along a route.  The Atlas is based upon a 3-D finite element model which is tuned and run in the port area.  The DTA uses the constituents from the tidal model, and incorporates seasonal water density variability and actual winds and air pressure to estimate the water level. Permanently installed sensors such as acoustic Doppler current meters, tide gauges and meteorological sensors are used to update and validate the water depth and water column current forecasts from the DTA.  
<P>

<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="graphics/keelp1.gif" alt=" "><BR>
<STRONG>Figure 1 Digital Tidal Atlas Predictor</STRONG></CENTER>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
The vessel squat predictor requires water depth/current information, bathymetric data, information about the vessel hull shape, and actual or forecast speed, heading, and draught information.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="graphics/keelp2.gif" alt=" "><BR>
<STRONG>Figure 2 Vessel Squat Predictor</STRONG></CENTER>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>



The Under Keel Clearance Predictor combines the above results.  Taking forecast squat plus forecast water depth, and adding digital bathymetry, it produces a forecast of the under keel clearance for the vessel.  The predictor incorporates its knowledge of the vessel dimensions and the surrounding bathymetry to return both the forecast clearance and a confidence level.<P>
This design supports the operator requests illustrated in Figure 4.  Based upon modern GUI technology supported by on-line help, and alarm and status indicators, the operator can request information under the general headings of current, water depth, and clearance.  <P>
Water column currents, surface currents and time series of currents can be displayed at any point in the port region.  Current information is similarly available when a request specifies the time, depth range, and the geographic region of interest.  All of this nowcast and forecast information is validated by tide and current information provided by on-line sensors in the port area.  <P>
The remaining information products include both planning and real-time monitoring tools.  For example, "Cross Flow over Route" provides a forecast of currents along a planned route.  "Clearance over Route" provides a graphical display of the forecast clearance as a function of time and position along the planned route.  In addition, as the vessel is transiting this route, real-time position and speed along the route is used to provide a real-time clearance forecast, including an alarm system which alerts the operator of a potential hazardous situation ahead of the vessel being tracked.

The "Safe Passage Window" and "Clearance during Loading" functions are used as planning tools.  Based upon vessel status and forecast conditions, they allow quick investigations of trade-offs between additional cargo and delayed sailing, and quicker departure with a lighter cargo.  <P>
<H3>System Architecture</H3>
The Under Keel Clearance Guide is implemented on a powerful work station, with real-time data flow as illustrated in Figure 5.  Here we see a Local Area Network connecting the port VTMS system with remote terminals and displays and the UKCG system.  
<P>
<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="graphics/keelp5.gif" alt=" "><BR>
<STRONG>Figure 5 Under Keel Clearance and Digital Tidal Atlas Real-Time Data Flow</STRONG></CENTER>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>

On the right-hand side of this diagram, the manual and automated input of sensor and other data are shown.  During an initial configuration and validation period, the data bases shown in the diagram are installed and tested.  A vessel data base describing hull form and vessel identification is required.  The tides/currents and non-tidal effects data bases are developed by running the models described above as customized for the port area.  Finally the bathymetric data base is collected, validated and installed from new surveys or existing charts and digital data.  After initial validation, these data bases are maintained and edited as required.  <P>
The remainder of Figure 5 shows the three main processing modules described earlier,  and their interfaces to the data bases and the GUI which handles information requests.<P>
Recognizing that the technology described here involves on-going evolution and improvement after installation, the system incorporates validation software tools, editing and Quality Assurance procedures, and a plan for regular review of performance.  In addition, training is an essential component of a successful long term implementation.  Including these elements within the system ensures that advanced technology like the UKCG continues to be a useful tool in the hand of the trained operators on a continuing basis.<P>

<H3>Implementation</H3>

The system is implemented on a DEC Alpha UNIX work station and requires 100 Mb of disc space and 40 Mb of virtual memory during operation.  A detailed interface specification was designed and implemented to ensure ease of integration of the UKCG into the Lockheed VTMS.  The system receives real-time data from both oceanographic and meteorological sensors via the VTMS local area network.  Four bottom mounted acoustic doppler current meters are being installed in the port area. Wind and air pressure data will be received from five existing meteorological stations located in the general area of the port.
<P>
The tidal data base has been constructed using existing bathymetry and coastline, together with the historical tide and current meter data.  A 3-D finite element model generated the tidal constituents data base with over 16,000 nodes each with 11 depth levels.  The nontidal effects data base was statistically generated using the observed meteorological and oceanographic data.  The bathymetry data base includes all of the over 300,000 data points provided by the Port.  Vessel hull characteristics are obtained from an on-line Lloyds data base of ships or from the system operators.
<P>
In order to access the system performance the validation software tool was used to verify correct operation. This validation tool uses either operator entered commands or command files to exercise the UKCG system and provide a quantitative assessment of the system performance. The historical oceanographic and meteorological data were played back and water level and current forecasts calculated for up to 48 hours in the future.  These DTA predictions were compared with the observed data to validate operation.  The vessel under keel clearance and loading functions were tested with information of ships known to visit the port transiting through the port traffic corridors.  These results were compared with manual observations.
<P>
Results from the validation process show that the UKCG provides significantly improved forecasts of water levels and vessel clearance forecasts over existing procedures up to 12 or 18 hours in the future.  It was found that non-tidal effects on water levels in the area of interest were up to 60 cm.  Typical vessel squat estimates for oil tankers underway in the port area were 50 cm.  The present port standing orders provide for a fixed safety allowance of 152 cm above the tidal predicted water level at the shoalest point of the vessel traffic corridor.  Considering these figures it is expected that UKCG will provide information which potentially would allow vessels to be loaded to optimal draughts 50 to 100 cm greater than currently used depending upon local conditions.<P>
<H3>Conclusions</H3>
The Under Keel Clearance Guide represents another tool for the safe and efficient management of modern port operations.  Integrating real-time and forecast winds and currents, digital bathymetry, and sophisticated models, the system provides detailed forecast and now-cast tools in the port area.  Graphical tools which allow a display of the forecast clearance as a vessel transits a route are provided.  The tools allow quick analyses of safe draughts for vessels while loading or entering the port, under actual current, tidal, and vessel speed conditions.  The technology will be particularly valuable in ports with limited clearance, or having strong currents, and where lightering operations are required.
<P>
At present, this technology is delivered as part of an integrated VTMS.  In the future, it will be implemented with remote portable terminals based upon a lap-top computer and a communications link with the VTMS.  This will allow pilots aboard vessels to access under keel clearance products in real-time.  <P>

<title>Quester Tangent QTC VIEW at the Port of Harwich</title>

<TABLE BORDER=0>
<TR><TD><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=8  SRC="graphics/spacer.jpg" alt=" "></TD><TD> 
<H1>Port of Harwich</H1>
The Port of Harwich is one of the largest container ports in the United Kingdom. The harbour floor is mapped regularly utilizing single and multibeam bathymetric surveys and seabed sampling techniques.  Seismic profiling, subsurface sampling and bathymetric mapping are used to assist in managing large-scale dredging operations.<P>
A QTC VIEW trial was held as the Harwich Haven Authority wished to evaluate echosounder-based seabed classification technology to assist dredging programs and provide details for harbour-floor environmental monitoring.<P>
<H3>System Configuration</H3>
The QTC VIEW seabed classification system was used for this trial.  The survey platform was a 12m launch with an ODOM 208 kHz echosounder.  The transducer was rigged to the vessel's side.  The QTC VIEW was linked via a junction box located between the transducer and sounder to monitor the transmitted pulse and first returning echo.  A 486DX laptop computer was connected to the QTC VIEW using a PCMCIA interface and a RS232 serial connection.  GPS information was transmitted to the laptop via a RS232 serial connection, and utilized a NMEA 183 GGA format.  The QTC VIEW system was powered by two car-sized batteries supplying 24 volts.<P>
<H3>Geological Setting</H3>
The survey area was located adjacent to a jetty (Fig. 1).  A dredged berthing basin along the face of the jetty had an average water depth of 10 - 12m and the basin's western boundary was marked by a small slope.  Directly west of the basin was the main channel, a dredged trough approximately 12-15m deep.  To the west of the trough was a shallow shelf approximately 8m below sealevel.
Previous dredging and grab sampling data indicated the shelf was a mud veneer over boulders and cobbles in a matrix of medium to fine sand and mud.  The toe of the slope leading from the shelf consisted of well-sorted fine to medium sand in a muddy matrix.  Mud or fine sand was expected in the main channel or berthing basin.<P>
Figure 1.	Schematic representation of the survey area showing the shelf, main channel, berthing basin and jetty. Circled numbers represent approximate locations of calibration sites.
<H3>Calibration</H3>
System calibration was completed by collecting approximately 200 echo's at sites representative of each bottom type to be mapped.  Although calibration from the complete range of seabed types was ideal, it was not absolutely necessary as new seabed classes can be recognized and mapped during post-processing.
Four calibration sites were identified from previous grab sampling and dredging operations including two sites on the shelf, one at the toe of the slope, and one in the main dredged channel.  A total of six calibration samples were taken: one from each of the four basic areas, one extra sample at the toe of the slope, and one to the south of the survey area (Fig. 1).  Grab samples were collected from each site, excepting site 6 south of the survey area.
A catalogue of seabed classes was defined using the information collected during the calibration exercise 
(Table 1).  Classes were defined based upon a visual estimate of grain size and sediment consolidation identified in the grab sample.

<H3>Survey Operations</H3>
Fifteen east-west lines and 2 north-south tie-lines were completed. The main east-west lines were approximately 1300m long at 100m intervals.  Seas were moderate with a strong tidal current.  The survey speed was 7 knots.<P>
<H3>Results</H3>
The initial assessment of the data indicated the shelf consisted of classes 1, 2, and 4 (areas of pebbles, sand, mud; compact mud; and fine sand).  The main channel was highly variable and contained classes 3, 4, 5, and 6 suggesting a bottom of soft mud, fine sand and mud, soft mud over well-sorted sand, and sand and gravel (assumed).  Class 3 was more abundant towards the eastern side of the main channel.  The east end of the survey area (berthing basin) contained classes 4, 5, and 6 suggesting a seabed of fine sand, soft mud over fine sand, and sand and gravel (assumed).<P>
The calibration data was analyzed and the result indicated the acoustic signal from class 3 was similar to class 5.  This was likely caused by limited penetration of the 200 kHz sounder in the soft mud deposited over the sand at site 5.  As signals from sites 3 and 5 were likely the response from the liquefied mud, class 5 was merged into class 3.  Sites 4 and 6 were acoustically similar, suggesting site 6 consisted primarily of sand instead of assumed sand and gravel.  Class 6 was merged into class 4.<P>
The seabed classification result is shown in Figure 2.  It indicates the shelf area is primarily fine sand with patches of compact mud and pebbles in a muddy sand matrix.  The floor of the main channel is soft mud, and the berthing basin has soft mud and fine sand to the south grading to fine sand to the north.  A patch of compacted mud and pebbles in a muddy sand matrix occurred in the northeast corner of the survey area.<P>
Figure 2.	Map of seabed classification over a 3-D plot of the bathymetry.  The seabed consists of four classes including mud, fine sand with silt and some pebbles, pebbles in a sandy mud matrix, and pebbles in a muddy sand matrix.
<H3>Summary</H3>
Seabed classification technology is well-suited to this type of application with the calibration and surveying exercise generating satisfactory real-time results.  The QTC VIEW technology and classification method provides efficient post-processing of data.  Analysis of the calibration data, specifically the acoustic signal from the various calibration sites, revealed similarities between classes and warranted the merging of these classes before producing a  final plot.<P>

<H1>Chesapeake Bay, Maryland</H1><H3> Introduction</H3>
The Maryland Geophysical Survey requested a QTC VIEW demonstration to evaluate digital technology for sediment classification in the coastal and estuarine environments of Chesapeake Bay. The trial was performed off Solomans Island where the Survey had previously completed extensive single and multibeam bathymetric studies and seabed sampling.<P> 
<H3>Equipment</H3>
Installed on the 16 m survey vessel R.V. Discovery, the QTC VIEW was connected in parallel with a Furuno FCV582 200 kHz sounder and 8 beam width transducer. The sounder had eight manual ranges with pulse durations from .1 ms to 1.4 ms and ping rates from 100 to 10 per second. Maximum output power was 500 watts RMS.<P> As the survey area had depth ranges from 
7 to 42 meters, the fourth range was selected with a pulse duration of .3 ms and a ping rate of 6 per second. A NMEA 0183, GGA navigation string was sent to the 486 DX2-66 laptop which logged and displayed both seabed classification information and GPS data.<P> 
<H3>Area</H3>
Chesapeake Bay is one of the largest inland coastal waterways in the United States. It covers approximately 14,000 square miles and has an average depth of 7 m. The Bay is predominately mud with areas of fine and medium grain sand. The survey area was located five miles east northeast from Solomans Island. <P> 
<H3>Calibration</H3>
The QTC VIEW was calibrated at four sites. Two grab samples were collected at each site to accurately characterize the seabed type. Site 1 was in 7.6 m of water and consisted of mud with 5% fine sand. Site 2 was in 14.7 m of water and consisted of a silty clay. The seabed at site 3 was a gas-charged mud in 36 m of water. When viewed on a colour echo sounder, there was little difference in the acoustic signature between sites 2 and 3. Site 4 was fine sand in 7 m of water. <P> 
<H3>Operations</H3>
A catalogue containing four classes was compiled and a survey line run from east-west over the various seabed types. The line was approximately 12 km in length and was run at vessel speeds from 3 to 14 knots. Seas were calm with little tidal action during the survey. <P> 
<H3>Results</H3>
From extensive surveys of the area, MGS personnel knew where the seabed transitions were located. The QTC VIEW showed the exact location of each transition and accurately distinguished between the four seabed types. During data acquisition, a number of grab samples were taken and confirmed the system's accuracy. <P>
<H3>Summary</H3>
Two interesting aspects of the QTC VIEW operational abilities were observed during this trial.  Firstly, the system was able to characterize gas-charged sediments. Secondly, the QTC VIEW was able to collect high quality data at vessel speeds of 14 knots without sacrificing data quality.<P></TD><TD>&#160;&#160;</TD></TR></TABLE>

<H1>Grand Banks, Newfoundland</H1>
<H3> Introduction</H3>
Canadian Marconi Company and Quinlan Brothers Seafoods invited Quester Tangent to install and operate the QTC VIEW aboard a working scallop dragger. The purpose was to identify scallop beds using digital seabed classification on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, Canada.<P>
<H3>Equipment</H3>
The QTC VIEW was installed on the bridge of the 22 m scallop dragger M.V. Cape Aaron. The system was connected to the 200 kHz transducer of a SI-TEX dual frequency 200/50 kHz echo sounder. A 486 DX2-66 MHz laptop computer displayed and stored data. Navigation information supplied by the vessels GPS, was logged in NMEA 0183 GGA, GLL formats.<P>
<H3>Area</H3>
Situated at the toe of the Grand Banks, Lilly Canyon has a water depth range between 90 and 2000 m. Scallops were located near the head of the canyon (90 -150 m) and were associated with a substrate of sand, cobbles and bedrock bordered by finer sediments containing sand dollars.<P>
<H3>Calibration</H3>
Sample echoes were collected at three sites enabling the system to recognize seabed types during the survey. The vessels drag was used for ground-truthing at the sites. The first site (water depth 100 m) consisted of gravel and cobbles. The second site (water depth 110 m) consisted of fine sands containing sand dollars. The third site (water depth 170 m) consisted of sands with scallops, starfish and crab. <P>
<H3>Results</H3>
The vessel shot its drag and proceeded to fish in a north/south direction in moderate seas with heavy chop. A drag speed of one to two knots was maintained. The QTC VIEW provided the vessel with a good visual picture of the scallop bed boundaries (Figure 1). The grounds were oriented parallel to depth contours. The zone of high productivity was narrower to the north with seabeds of sand dollars to each side.<P>
It was important for the scallop dragger to avoid sand dollars to  minimize bycatch. The QTC VIEW's track plot was used to steer the vessel over the areas of highest productivity, including the narrow part of the scallop zone.<P>

<H3>Summary</H3>
The QTC VIEW demonstrated digital seabed classification is an effective tool for the scallop fishery. By training the system to identify seabeds containing target species, the QTC VIEW maximized the harvest and minimized bycatch. <P>

Welcome to the U.S. Department of Transportation's Public Affairs
electronic information page.  From here, you can access current
news and information from press releases, fact sheets and selected
speeches given by Transportation Secretary Federico Pe&#241;a.  This web page
was last updated January 17, 1997.
<P>
Announcements and news items are posted on this page for approximately ten
days.  Any item older than this can be accessed from the
appropriate DOT agency listed below.  For example, public affairs information
dealing with railroads can be accessed by
selecting the Federal
Railroad Administration link; a speech by Secretary Pe&#241;a on
an auto safety
recall can be accessed by selecting either Office of the
Secretary (all Secretarial
speeches) or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
(which contains
auto safety recall information).

<HR>
<H3>January 3, 1997</H3>
We have replaced our search engine with Excite for Web Servers.  Check out
our new <A HREF="/search/">search form</A>.  Your search results will now
reflect the true location of the document on our web server rather than the
document ID of a search database.<P>

<H3>January 1, 1997</H3>
Happy New Year.<P>

<H3>December 11, 1996</H3>

The Federal Railroad Admin is now located on their own web server.  The new

and at-risk adults.  A <A HREF="http://www.dot.gov/affairs/nht8196.htm">press 
release</A> details the steps announced Friday.  Additional information on air 
bag issues can be obtained from the NHTSA web site at 
<A HREF="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov">http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov</A>.<P>

<H3>October 23, 1996</H3>
We've done some re-organization on our server directories.  Most of the 
subdirectories (sections) have been moved up one level (getting rid of the
"/dotinfo/" part of the URL.  If you encounter any problems accessing pages
that fall under the previous directory structure, please notify our 
<A HREF="mailto:webmaster@www.dot.gov">webmaster</A>.<P>

The "<A HREF="/help/webmap.html">DOT Web Server Quick Locator</A>" has been
updated with more sections, as well as corrected links to reflect the new
directory structure.<P>

<H3>October 21, 1996</H3>
The DOT along with the University of Tennessee is sponsoring a conference
entitled "<A HREF="/general/announce/btb-invite.html">Building Transportation's
Bridges to the 21st Century</A>".  More information is available under our 
<I><A HREF="/general/announce/announce.html">Events and Announcements</A></I> 
Section.<P>

<H3>October 8, 1996</H3>
The <A HREF="/ost/docr/">Departmental Office of Civil Rights</A> is 
now online.<P>

<H2>Viewing And Downloading Files</H2>

Most of the files on the DOT Web server are stored in one 
of the 3 following formats:

<UL>
<LI>	<B>Native HTML</B> - These files are formated in HTML and are viewable
	only with a Web browser.  With HTML we can format text and insert
	graphics in our documents.  <P>

<LI>	<B>ASCII Text</B> - These files have no formatting and can be viewed
	on any system.  This of course is the simplest way to ensure
	that anybody can read a file, but it's the least attractive. <P>

<LI>	<B>Adobe Acrobat</B> - Acrobat is an application that will take print
	output and save it in a format that can be recreated at will.
	Using the Acrobat reader, you can view, search, and print the
	document in it's original form complete with graphics, color,
	and original fonts.  You can't view these documents on-line
	(yet) without having a seperate viewer program, but it's 
	the best way to download really graphically intense documents.  <P>

	<A HREF="/acro.html">Click here to download the Adobe viewer for your system.</A><P>
</UL>

Some of our documents (mostly found on our gopher links) are stored 
in native word processer (ie: MS Word or WordPerfect) or other application 
formats (ie: MS Excel, PK ZIP, etc).  This is occasionally unavoidable.  
To download these files without attempting to load an associated program, press the &lt;SHIFT&gt; key then click on the document pointer.  This should (on most browsers) force the browser to save that document to your local disk.<P>  
 
<H3>Movies</H3>

We have adopted Apple's Quicktime format for any digital movies we distribute.
Why?  It works better, and it's compatible with both Mac and DOS based systems.
You will need to download Apple's Quicktime for Windows software in order to
play these movies on Windows.  Mac systems should already have the Quicktime
software. Windows users will need the <A HREF="http://quicktime.apple.com/winlicense.html">QuickTime for Windows</A>
software from Apple.<P>

<title>Resolving Transportation Problems</title>
</head>

<body>
<IMG SRC="tips.gif">
<BR>
You want your transportation  to be safe whether you travel by your personal car or by public or
private transportation. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) makes every effort to
assure that transportation is safe and secure. <p>

Each agency within the Department has regulatory jurisdiction over issues that affect consumers
rather than individuals. In many cases when we are unable to resolve your complaint, we can
still help. We collect complaints from people like you. When a widespread problem clearly
exists, we can investigate, initiate a recall campaign (if the problem in a motor vehicle is a safety
defect), or revise a safety standard affecting the industry. <p>

In a complaint about airline service or a motor vehicle, we provide the carrier or manufacturer
with a copy of the complaint. When we send the complaints to the company, it may result in a
satisfactory solution of individual problems. So, if you have a complaint about any mode of
transportation, you can contact DOT by calling the numbers on the back of this fact sheet. <p>

DOT encourages you to attempt to resolve your complaint and here are some tips to help you
resolve your problem:<p>

<ul>
  <li>Always start with the business that sold the item, performed the service, or agreed to
      perform the service. Most companies include instructions for resolving a problem on
      their paperwork. The instructions may include a telephone number (usually an 800
      number), a mailing address, and a statement that you must write and telephone the
      company. Follow the company's instructions. Calmly and accurately describe the
      complaint. State clearly what you consider a fair resolution.  </li><P>

  <li>Keep a file of all paperwork relating to your purchase or service. Your file should
      include copies of tickets, sales receipts, repair orders, warranties, cancelled checks,
      contracts, and all correspondence relating to the problem. (Keep the originals of all
      paperwork and copies of all letters you send.) </li><P>

  <li>Keep a record of your efforts to solve the problem. Your log should include dates and
      times, the person(s) you talked to, what was promised, and what was done.</li><P>

  <li>Contact the company's headquarters. If you have followed the company's procedures to
      resolve the complaint and have not obtained a satisfactory resolution, contact the
      company's headquarters. Many companies have an 800 number. You may find it on their
      official documents, the product, a directory of companies available in a library, or by
      calling 1-800-555-1212. When talking to the official, be sure to relate your previous
      efforts to resolve the problem. Follow up your phone conversation with a letter addressed
      to the president of the company (or the consumer affairs office). Keep a copy of this
      letter in your file.   </li><P>

  <li><b>Include your name, address, and phone numbers in all correspondence. </b>This
      information makes it easier for the company to respond to you. If you send any
      paperwork, always enclose a photocopy. If your paperwork includes an order number or
      customer identification number, be sure to include it in the letter.</li><P>

  <li><b>Seek help from local and state agencies.</b> If you are still unable to resolve your
      complaint, contact your local or state consumer protection office, the city, county, or
      state's attorney for additional help.</li><P>
</ul>
<p>

Again, we greatly appreciate the information you provide the U.S. Department of
Transportation.  You, our consumer, are one of  DOT's most valuable assets. <p>

	    Secretary of Transportation</H2></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

     Federico F. Pe&ntilde;a, the 12th U.S. Secretary of Transportation, has in three-
and-a-half years compiled an outstanding record of  increasing the global
competitiveness of the transportation industry; improving the safety of travel;
and streamlining the Department of Transportation, while investing more in
America's infrastructure than any Secretary in history.    <P>

     In the area of global competitiveness, the transportation sector is the
healthiest it has been in decades.  Five hundred thousand of the 10 million jobs
created since President Clinton took office are in transportation services.<P>  

     Secretary Pe&ntilde;a helped revitalize the U.S. airline industry and signed
aviation agreements with 40 nations opening lucrative markets for American
airlines and cargo carriers and promoting easier travel for Americans and
tourists to the U.S.  At the President's request, he has conducted commercial
diplomacy efforts around the world, and he is credited with helping American
businesses sell billions of dollars in exports to Asia and the Middle East.  He also
orchestrated for President Clinton the revitalization of shipbuilding, leading to
the sale of the first American-made large vessels to foreign countries in 38 years. <P>

     He is responsible for bringing airline consumers the same level of safety
for all flights -- from jumbo jets to a 10-seater, and he has spurred the truck, bus
and rail industries to promote safety.<P>  

     As for streamlining his department, Secretary Pe&ntilde;a downsized the work
force by 11,000 positions, while upsizing investments in America's infrastructure
by 10 percent.  He rewrote the rule book on financing highway projects, which
has encouraged private financing, and speeded up construction of more than 75
projects by two or three years at no cost to the federal taxpayer. <P>

     He also is leading the way for cities to use new technologies to manage
traffic congestion and has set a national goal to cut American's commute time by
15 percent in a decade; and he has emphasized consumer protection, by
improving an auto safety hotline and ensuring proper airline ticketing and
advertising practices.<P>

     As the Service Secretary for the U.S. Coast Guard, he has provided
 leadership for the nation's fifth armed service to save lives and protect our
environment.  On his watch, the Coast Guard rescued 56,000 Haitian and Cuban
boat people, fought devastating floods and hurricanes, and -- last winter --
ensured the uninterrupted flow of commerce despite unprecedented ice
conditions.  <P>

     From 1983-91, he was Mayor of Denver leading an urban and economic
renaissance, reversing Denver's mid-1980s decline through a series of bold
initiatives.  Most notably, he won approval for the construction of one of the
largest and most technological advanced airports in the world, Denver
International, which, as Secretary of Transportation, he dedicated in February
1995. <P> 

     Pe&ntilde;a also has served as a Colorado legislator and a civil rights lawyer.<P>

     He has received many honors.  In 1995, he was named Father of the Year
by the National Father's Day Committee.  In 1994, the American Subcontractors
Association of Colorado named him Man of the Year; and he received the Se&ntilde;or
Internacional Award from LULAC Council 12, the American Heritage Award
from the Mountain States Anti-Defamation League, the National Leadership and
Service Award from the Travelers Aid Society of Washington, and the Person of
the Year Award from the American Association of Port Authorities. <P> 

     Secretary Pe&ntilde;a did his undergraduate work at the University of Texas,
where he also received his law degree.  Florida International University awarded
him an Honorary Doctor of Public Service degree in 1995.<P>

     Born in Laredo, Texas, in 1947, Secretary Pe&ntilde;a is the third of six children
of a cotton broker.  He and his wife, world-class marathon runner and attorney
Ellen Hart Pe&ntilde;a, live with their two children in Alexandria, Virginia. <P>

<H1>The North Atlantic Current Project: Observational Studies</H1>

<P>
<HR></P>

<P>The North Atlantic Current is being studied by a group of observationalists
and modellers here at URI/GSO, with <A HREF="tom.html">Dr. Tom Rossby </A>and
<A HREF="http://seip.gso.uri.edu/LRot.html">Dr. Lew Rothstein </A>as co-principal
investigators. Among the observational studies are a <B><A HREF="floats.html">multi-year
RAFOS float study</A> </B>and a regional climatology of the Newfoundland
Basin. 
<HR></P>

<H2>A regional climatology of the Newfoundland Basin on neutral surfaces</H2>

<P>A climatological description of the North Alantic Current (NAC) region
has been developed from the historical hydrographic record as provided
by the National Oceanographic Data Center. The climatology is described
on specific volume anomaly surfaces which provide approximations to the
neutral surfaces upon which water parcels are free to move and mix laterally.
The median depth, temperature, salinity, potential density, potential vorticity,
and Montgomery potential (an exact stream function on specific volume anomaly
surfaces) are described on a 0.5 degree grid for the Newfoundland Basin.
This regional climatology presents a fine scale neutral surface view of
the waters of the Newfoundland Basin which allows a more detailed study
of the system than is afforded by other existing climatologies for the
North Atlantic. </P>

<P>A complete discussion of the climatology may be found in the following

and crew. </P>

<P><BR CLEAR=BOTH>
</P>

<P>Since August 1992 the container vessel M/V <I>Oleander</I>, which transits
weekly between New Jersey and Bermuda, has been collecting upper ocean
current velocity and surface temperature data using an acoustic Doppler
current profiler (ADCP) automated by special software (AutoADCP). Along
its transit the ship crosses the Slope Water, Gulf Stream, and part of
the Sargasso Sea, and thus offers the unprecedented opportunity to measure
the local flow of these waters on a repeated long-term basis. The project's
goal is to establish a multi-year dataset that will permit detailed studies
of seasonal and interannual variability of the upper ocean velocity and
temperature fields. </P>

<P>The difficulties of operating an ADCP on a container vessel, such as
bubble attenuation, electrical problems, and navigational errors, are described
in Flagg et al. (<I>J. Atmos. Oceanic Tech.</I>, 1996 submitted). Combining
data from attitudinal GPS (AGPS) and ADCP `bottom tracking' mode has yielded
transducer misalignment angle and speed scaling factor to within 0.07 deg
and 0.3%, respectively. The velocities collected using AGPS have most navigational
errors removed, and have produced information on the magnitude and extent
of gyrocompass errors in the pre-AGPS (pre-June 1995) data. </P>

<P>The data are being processed using the publicly available CODAS (Common
Oceanographic Data Access System) data processing software developed at
the <A HREF="http://www.soest.hawaii.edu">University of Hawaii</A> by <A HREF="http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/~efiring/">Dr.
Eric Firing,</A> Julie Ranada, Ramon Cabrera and others.</P>

<P>An example of velocity vector plots, from an outbound cruise during
the first week of January 1997, can be seen by clicking <A HREF="Gifs/vectors.gif">here</A>.
Vectors are plotted at depths of 25m, 50m, 100m and 200m. The location
of the Gulf Stream is obvious from the strong vectors, up to nearly 200
cm/sec to the northeast.</P>

(decadal scale) fluctuations in the heat flux through the North Atlantic Ocean. 
The term decadal has been used to refer to low frequency fluctuations with 
periods of 10-30 years. This task requires a long temporal series of 
repeated trans-Atlantic sections.<br>

As far as I know, such data are not available. If you know about the
existence of such a data set, please, contact me. I'll be forever grateful.<br>
<p>
So, to be able to proceed with my study, I had to ...<br>

Well, if you are interested why don't you read my 
<A HREF="http://rafos/olga_html/mht/prop"> thesis proposal</a>?<br>
Please, feel free to express any comments.

<H2> Why do I have a page here?</H2>
<DT> I received my Ph.D. at GSO, and my dissertation investigated the
pathways of transport and exchange of waters in the North Atlantic Current.
As part of this work, I constructed a
high-resolution neutral-surface climatology of
the North Atlantic Current region.  It is publicly available at
<A HREF="nac.html"> the NAC climatology page </A>.

<p>
I'm currently working at the National Data Buoy Center in Mississippi,

<H1>North Atlantic Current Project: RAFOS Float Studies</H1>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>The objective of the RAFOS float program, jointly supported by the <A HREF="http://www.onr.navy.mil/">Office
of Naval Research </A>and the <A HREF="http://www.nsf.gov/">National Science
Foundation</A>, was to study the structure of the currents in the North
Atlantic Currrent (NAC) region and the exchange of waters between the subtropical
and subpolar gyres in the Newfoundland Basin. One hundred <A HREF="Gifs/bigtom_2.gif">RAFOS
floats </A>were deployed on two density surfaces corresponding to sigma-theta
= 27.2 and 27.5, respectively. All floats were designed to cycle once or
twice a day to density surfaces 0.1 sigma-t units above and below their
nominal level to determine changes in stratification and temperature along
the trajectories. Three separate float deployments took place: July-August
1993, November-December 1993 and October-November 1994. Most float missions
had a duration of ten months, with the final floats surfacing in the summer
of 1995. At the end of its mission, each float releases its ballast weight,
returns to the surface, and telemeters data to <A HREF="http://www.argosinc.com/">Argos</A>,
a French satellite-based data collection and platform location system.
Once all the data are downloaded and processed, the trajectory of the float
can be reconstructed from the time series of acoustic travel times. The
pressure and temperature time series are also included in the telemetered
data. The floats were tracked using <A HREF="Gifs/sources.gif">four moored
sound sources </A>developed by <A HREF="http://www.polarint.com/sprtnfcn.htm">Sparton
of Canada</A>, energized by power modules from Webb Research Corp. of East
Falmouth, Massachusetts.</P>

<P>We present hear a summary of the float trajectories on each density
surface. For additional information or a copy of our data report, please

<blockquote>The Gerson Therapy is an intensive, nutrition-based and detoxifying medical
treatment for cancer, heart disease, diabetes and other chronic, degenerative diseases.  It works
closely with nature to help the sick body to rid itself of disease through the supportive effects of
simple foods, juices, and non-toxic medication.  Its successes in curing the dread diseases of our
times for the past 75 years have no parallel in the conventional medical context.<p>
The Gerson Institute is a non-profit organization dedicated to the holistic treatment of degenerative diseases. We strive to educate the public on the benefits of holistic healing through worldwide lectures and seminars, publication and distribution of literature on the Gerson Therapy, Training programs for Physicians, Healthcare practitioners, and home care assistants, and through establishing ties to approved clinics and treatment centers.

<P><A NAME="train"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>Gerson Therapy Physician
Training Program</FONT></P>

<P>For many physicians, managing the care of patients with chronic
debilitating illness can be a time-consuming and unfulfilling task.
Conventional protocols in treatment of degenerative diesases can
often offer limited benefit to the patient and can severely
compromise the quality of life during and after the treatment
period.</P> 

<P>The Gerson <FONT SIZE=-2>(tm)</FONT> Therapy provides
an answer to the physician who seeks a holistic, scientifically
proven treatment for life-threatening illness. Originally developed
in the 1930s by <A HREF="maxbio.html">Max Gerson, M.D.</A>, the
therapy offers the health care professional a safe, viable and
practical method of treating many degenerative diseases.</P> 

<P><A HREF="treatmnt.html">The Gerson Therapy</A> is an integrated
holistic protocol developed by Max Gerson, M.D. for standalone and
adjunctive use in the treatment of degenerative diseases. Over <A
HREF="biblio.html">200 articles</A> in the peer reviewed medical
literature document its effectiveness, and provide further
understanding of the tissue damage syndrome (intracellular edema),
supplementing nutritional deficiencies through the use of fresh,
organic fruit and vegetable juices. Providing an intensive, nutrition
based, high-fluid, micronutrient, salt and water management, the
Gerson Therapy is rich in phytochemicals, supplements potassium, and
restricts dietary fat, protien, and sodium. Extensive mechanical
detoxification through enemas combined with stimulation of
glutathione production systems dramatically improve elimination of
cell wastes.</P> 

<P>Because of the non-specific nature of the protocol, it is often
effective in treatment of a wide range of cancers, autoimmune,
collagen, and degenerative diesases. The Gerson Therapy has been
shown in the medical literature to be extraordinarily effective in
achieving long-term remission in Stage I-IV melanomas, exceeding
survival rates achieved with conventional managements by as much as
40%. [This study is available for viewing <A
HREF="melanoma.html">here</A>.] Dramatic long-term recoveries have
been observed with lymphoma, Duke's-C colorectal cancer, ovarian
cancer, and oat cell and adenocarcinomas of the lung. Biopsy-verified
full remissions have been observed in astrocytoma and cancers of the
breast, liver, pancreas and prostate, including some cases with
extensive metastases. Full remission of symptoms has been documented
in a number of cases of systematic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid
arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. </P> 

<P>Relatively unique about the Gerson management is that it does not
use any proprietary medications. All medications and supplements are
classed as biologicals, and are supplied in therapeutic amounts. All
are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. All of the
procedures, medications, and techniques used in the protocol have
been fully tested and effectively used for many years, and are
completely safe when used according to the protocol.</P> 

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Why The Gerson Therapy is a Sensible Choice for your
Practice</FONT></P>

<P>There are many paths to wellness, and many different philosophies
about appropriate treatment of life-threatening degenerative
diseases. <I>Why choose the Gerson Therapy over the many other
treatments available?</I></P> 

<P>We believe the answer lies in the combination of results, patient
satisfaction, scientific approach, and our philosophy of coordination
and partnership with practitioners and treatment centers.</P> 

<P>We believe the Gerson protocol itself to be the most complete,
all-encompassing approach to wellness available anyhwere. The Gerson
Therapy incorporates dietary and lifestyle modification,
sophisticated biochemical managements, intensive, multi-faceted
detoxification, psychological and mind/body approaches, and attention
to symptomatic relief through non-toxic means. When appropriate, the
Gerson protocol is combined with other proven managements to provide
the most complete, powerful approach to cancer and other degenerative
diseases available anywhere. We constantly review the medical
literature, seeking new ways of reaching even the most advanced cases
of cancer and disease. The Gerson Institute approaches modifications
and additions carefully, with great consideration, and sound testing
before inclusion in the Gerson protocol, ensuring both the
practitioner and patient of the safest, most efficacious treatment
available.</P>

<P>Adding the Gerson protocol to your practice will give you the
satisfaction of seeing rapid improvement in health and outlook in
otherwise &quot;terminal&quot; patients. Since patients are actively
involved in restoring and maintaining their own health, they tend to
develop self-reliance, decreasing &quot;emergency&quot; and panic
calls, and increasing satisfaction with their medical treatment. As a
certified Gerson practitioner, you will participate in case review
with the Gerson Institute, providing us with valuable statistical
data, and ensuring that you have appropriate expertise available for
the treatment of difficult or unusual cases.</P>

<P>Financially, working with Gerson patients is rewarding, as
patients will require consultations and follow-up care on a regular
basis for twenty-four months or longer. Also, since they become very
dedicated to their treatment, patients often discuss their treatment
with friends, co-workers, family, and others, resulting in
word-of-mouth referrals, the most effective form of advertising.</P>

<P>As a certified Gerson practitioner participating in our referral
program, you will benefit from our national advertising, outreach, and
education efforts. Patients seeking outpatient treatment in your area
will be referred to your practice. The Gerson Institute will also
coordinate with you and endeavor to schedule educational seminars and
lectures with Gerson Institute staff in your area, further helping to
build your clientele of Gerson Therapy patients.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Training Patients in the Gerson
Protocol</FONT></B></P>

<P>The responsibilities of the physician managing a patient on the
Gerson Therapy will vary with the condition of the patient and
diagnosis, but typically includes the regular monitoring of patient
status and disease staging through interpretation of pathology and
other appropriate means.</P> 

<P>Modifications in diet, medications, and other protocols must be
prescribed based on both traditional and non-traditional indications.
The physician must also be prepared to assist the patient in managing
acute healing reactions with dietary and/or medication modifications,
and emotional support. We have found that the psychological aspect of
treatment is important, particularly during this reaction period.
Access to the treating physician is vital, as many of the healing
responses are unfamiliar, and can therefore be frightening to the
patient and his or her family members or care providers.</P>

<P>In addition to the medical interventions required, it should be
understood that the Gerson protocol is a complex combination of
dietary restrictions, medication and enema administration, and
lifestyle and environmental changes. We recommend that practitioners
provide patients with complete instruction and followup in the
specifics of the treatment, either through the distribution of Gerson
Institute publications and videos, or through individualized patient
training and ongoing consultation.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Gerson Therapy Certification: A Partnership for
Success</FONT></B></P>

<P>The new era of managed care, limited resources, and tight cost
controls in medical treatment have opened the door for broad
acceptance of treatment such as the Gerson protocol. Gerson care
costs are significantly lower than conventional cancer managements,
benefiting insurance providers. Practitioners benefit by establishing
a health partnership with their patients, improving the
doctor/patient relationship, and reducing the likelihood of
dissatisfaction that can lead to costly legal actions.  Patients
benefit by developing self-confidence, improving their outlook, and
taking responsibility for their well-being.</P>

<P>Public demand for the scientifically proven Gerson Therapy
treatment is skyrocketing. In 1995, in response to the increasing
demand for Gerson Therapy treatment, the Gerson Institute began to
develop medical education and certification programs to increase
access to the Gerson Therapy, and to protect the reputation for
excellence and high quality care that the Gerson name has come to
represent.</P>

<P>Practitioners seeking to use the Gerson Therapy in
their practices achieve certification through a four-phase process.
Completion of the Level I training described below is the first phase.
The second phase is completion of a two-week internship at a Gerson
inpatient treatment center. Intern practitioners will work directly
with patients and experienced Gerson physicians. In phase three,
practitioners will treat patients in their own practice,
with assistance and supervision from Gerson Institute staff and
Gerson-trained physicians. The last phase is a three-day training,
review, and skill-assessment program. To maintain certification,
practitioners must maintain a high standard of patient care and
appropriate treatment, follow Gerson Institute guidelines regarding
patient management and treatment, provide data tothe Gerson Institute
for research, case management, and statistical purposes, and complete
approved continuing education units. We anticipate that
practitioners who work diligently will be able to complete the
certification process in twelve to eighteen months. A complete,
detailed description of the certification program will be available in
early 1997.</P>

<P>The certified practitioner will be eligible for a
number of benefits, including the following:</P><UL><LI>Ongoing
consultation and support from Gerson Institute staff and
Gerson-trained physicians</LI> <LI>Access to a network of other Gerson
practitioners</LI><LI>Gerson Institute patient referrals seeking
treatment and long-term follow-up</LI> <LI>Permission to use the
Gerson name in connection with treatment of patients and marketing for
new patients</LI> <LI>Support with local publicity and outreach to
develop your practice</LI> </UL> 

<P><B>We invite you to work with us. Through the efforts of our
organization and a group of talented, dedicated medical
practitioners, we can achieve our vision of making this safe,
effective treatment available to patients worldwide.</B></P><P> <HR

<P><A NAME="phase1"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Treating Degenerative Diseases
with the Gerson Therapy: Phase I Training Program</FONT></P> <P>This
program is designed to introduce the health care practitioner to the
practice of the Gerson protocol as originally described in Gerson's
Monograph, &quot;<I><A HREF="booklist.html#acancertherapy">A Cancer
Therapy</A></I>&quot; (Historic Edition, Gerson Institute, 1996), with
current enhancements and additions. The six day intensive training
will offer direct instruction from Charlotte Gerson, experienced
Gerson-trained physicians, and other senior Gerson Institute
staff.</P> <P>Practitioners attending the program will gain a
fundamental understanding of the Gerson Therapy treatment,
assessment, follow-up and monitoring protocols, and will have access
to resources for ongoing training, support, and consultation from the
Gerson Institute.</P><P>The nature of interactions between various
elements of the Gerson protocol require serious study and
considerable clinical experience before full understanding of the
protocol will be gained.  For this reason, the training program is
intended as a starting point for practitioners seeking to incorporate
Gerson protocols into their practice.</P><P><B>Presentations Included

<title>The Treatment</title>

</head>

<body>

<h3>The Treatment</h3>



<p>Thirteen glasses daily of various fresh raw juices prepared hourly

from organically grown fruits and vegetables.

<p>Three full vegetarian meals, freshly prepared from organically grown

vegetables, fruits, and whole grains.



<p><h4>Individual medications including:</h4>

<pre>

    a.  potassium compound,

    b.  thyroid hormone,

    c.  Lugol's Solution

    d.  injectable crude liver extract with B-12,

    e.  pancreatic enzymes,

    f.  enemas of coffee and/or chamomile tea,

    g.  castor oil

</pre>



<p>The Gerson Therapy is an intensive, nutrition-based, medical

treatment. It works closely with nature to help the sick body to rid

itself of disease through the supportive effects of simple foods,

juices, and non-toxic medication.



<p><h4>The main features of the diet are:</h4>

<pre>

    1) sodium restriction,

    2) potassium supplementation,

    3) extreme fat restriction,

    4) periodic (temporary) protein restriction,

    5) high vitamin,

    6) high mineral,

    7) fluid rich,

    8) high micronutrient.

</pre>

<p>Although the diet allows for some cooked foods, emphasis is placed on

the consumption of unaltered foods.  Fresh, raw fruits and vegetables

are the source materials of all micronutrients in their pristine

organic composition.  Beyond supplying adequate quantities of all

known nutrients, the use of specific raw fruits and vegetables and

their juices ensures that patients receive even those health

promoting factors not yet appreciated by science.



<p>Medications used in the Gerson Therapy are classed as biologicals,

materials of organic origin which are found in the body and are

supplied in therapeutic amounts.



<p>An important treatment employed as part of the Gerson Therapy is

frequent detoxification of tissues and blood by coffee enemas which

cause stimulation of enzyme systems of the gut wall and liver and

promote excretion of toxic bile.

<title>Gerson Therapy-Dr. Max Gerson's Biography</title>

</head>

<body>

<pre>     <img src="max.gif" alt=" "> Max Gerson, M. D. 1881 - 1959

<img src ="banner1.gif" alt="*">

</pre>

<h1>Dr. Max Gerson's Biography</h1>

<p>Dr. Max Gerson, M. D. was born in 1881 in Wongrowitz, Germany.  He

attended the Universities of Breslau, Wuerzburg, Berlin and Freiburg.

He was the director of a special department of tuberculosis at the

Munich University Hospital under the sponsorship of Dr. Ferdinand

Sauerbruch, a world famous thoracic surgeon and tuberculosis

authority.



<p>As a young German medical student, Gerson suffered from severe

migraine headaches.  He had been told that they were untreatable, and

that he would have to learn to live with them.  To his joy, Gerson

found that by restricting his diet, by avoiding salt, fats, pickled

and smoked foods, and by eating fresh fruits and vegetables, he could

control them.  Soon, he was sharing this new "migraine diet" with his

patients.



<p>One of Gerson's patients insisted that the migraine diet had cured his

skin tuberculosis.  Gerson listened, carefully weighing the

possibility that the diet might somehow be enhancing immunity.  He

decided that it might be true, and set out to validate it.  In the

process, his work came to the attention of Sauerbruch.  A new era in

medicine was born.  In 1929, Sauerbruch announced Gerson's dietary

therapy as a cure for skin TB, publishing simultaneously in a dozen of

the world's leading peer-reviewed scientific journals. Sauerbruch told

of a clinical trial of Gerson's dietary treatment in which 446 of 450

TB patients achieved lasting cures (also mentioned in Sauerbruch's

autobiography, "Master Surgeon").  Gerson lectured in the principal

cities of Europe until the pre-war political climate forced him to

emigrate in 1933.



<p>During this time, Gerson attracted the friendship of Nobel Prize

winner Albert Schweitzer, M. D., by curing his wife of lung

tuberculosis after she had failed to respond to all conventional

managements.  1934 saw the publication of "Diet Therapy for Lung

Tuberculosis" (pub. Franz Deuticke, Leipzig and Vienna) in which

Mrs. Schweitzer is documented case 45.  Gerson and Schweitzer remained

friends for life, and maintained a regular correspondence.  Schweitzer

followed Gerson's progress as the diet therapy was applied

successfully to a wide variety of pathologies, including heart and

kidney failure, and finally cancer.  Schweitzer's own adult onset

diabetes responded to Gerson's dietary treatment.



<p>In 1946, Gerson demonstrated recovered cancer patients before the

Pepper-Neely Congressional Sub-Committee, during hearings on S. 1875,

a bill to authorize the President to wage war on cancer. Although only

a few peer-reviewed journals were receptive to his revolutionary

ideas, Gerson continued to publish in the U. S. and abroad.



<p>Gerson died in 1959.  He was eulogized by Albert Schweitzer:



<p>"I see in him one of the most eminent geniuses in the history of

medicine.  Many of his basic ideas have been adopted without having

his name connected with them.  Yet he has achieved more than seemed

possible under adverse conditions.  He leaves a legacy which commands

attention and, which will assure him his due place.  Those whom he

cured will now attest to the truth of his ideas."

<h3>History of the Gerson Therapy</h3>

<a href="ward.html"><h3>by Dr. Patricia Spain Ward</h3></a>



<p>It is one of the least edifying facts of recent American medical history that

the profession's leadership so long rejected as quackish the idea that

nutrition affects health (JAMA 1946 1949, 1977; Shimkin, 1976).  Ignoring both

the empirical dietary wisdom that pervaded western medicine from the

pre-Christian Hippocratic era until the late nineteenth century and a

persuasive body of modern research in nutritional biochemistry, the

politically minded spokesmen of organized medicine in the U.S.  remained 

long committed to surgery and radiation as the sole acceptable treatments for

cancer.  This commitment persisted, even after sound epidemiological data

showed that early detection and removal of malignant tumors did not "cure"

most kinds of cancer (Crile, 1956; updated by Cairns, 1985).



<p>The historical record shows that progress lagged especially in cancer

immunotherapy - including nutrition and hyperthermia - because power over

professional affiliation and publication (and hence over practice and

research) rested with men who were neither scholars nor practitioners nor

researchers themselves, and who were often unequipped to grasp the rapidly

evolving complexities of the sciences underlying mid-twentieth-century

medicine.



<p>Nowhere is this maladaption of professional structure to medicine's changing

scientific context more tragically illustrated than in the American experience

of Max B. Gerson (1881- 1959), founder of the best-known nutritional treatment

for cancer of the pre-macrobiotic era.  A scholar's scholar and a superlative

observer of clinical phenomena, Gerson was a product of the German medical

education which Americans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries considered

so superior to our own that all who could afford it went to Germany to perfect

their training (Bonner, 1963). As a medical graduate of the University of

Freiburg in 1909, Gerson imbibed all of the latest in scientific medicine,

with the emphasis on specificity which bacteriology had brought into western

medical thought in the preceding decades. Gerson subsequently worked with

leading German specialists in internal medicine, in physiological chemistry,

and in neurology (U.S. Congress, 1946, 98). The historical record does not

tell us whether his medical education in Germany (where much of the early work

in nutritional chemistry took place) included a study of diet, a subject

neglected in American medical schools after the germ theory gained acceptance.



<p>We do know that by 1919, when Gerson set up a practice in internal and nervous

diseases in Bielefeld, he had devised an effective dietary treatment for the

migraine headaches which frequently disabled him, despite the best efforts of

his colleagues. In 1920, while treating migraine patients by this salt-free

vegetarian diet, he discovered that it was also effective in lupus vulgaris

(tuberculosis of the skin, then considered incurable) and, later, in arthritis

as well (U.S. Congress, 1946, 98).



<p>Trained in the theories of specific disease causation and treatment that began

to dominate western medicine - for the first time in history - as

bacteriological discoveries multiplied in the late nineteenth century, Gerson

was at first uneasy about using a single therapy in such seemingly disparate

conditions.  But he was committed to the primacy of clinical evidence, which

he liked to express in Kussmaul's dictum: "The result at the sick-bed is

decisive" (quoted in Gerson, 1958, 212).  In later years, after research began

to provide explanations for Gerson's clinical observations, he quoted

Churchill on the mistaken course of action he had thus avoided: "Men

occasionally stumble over the truth, but most pick themselves up and hurry off

as if nothing had happened" (Gerson, 1958, 212).  Gerson persisted. In 1924

his success in treating tuberculosis of the skin brought an invitation from

the noted thoracic surgeon, Ferdinand Sauerbruch, to test Gerson's diet in a

special lupus clinic to be provided by the Bavarian government at the

University of Munich. As Sauerbruch recounts it in his autobiography, 446

patients out of 450 recovered - once he had discovered and put an end to the

smuggling of sausages, cream and beer to the patients in the late afternoons (

Sauerbruch, 1953, 167- 171 ).  Later extended to pulmonary tuberculosis as

well, this Gerson-Sauerbruch-Hermannsdorfer diet was widely used in Germany

and became the subject of Gerson's first book in 1934 (Gerson, 1934;

Hildenbrand, 1987 communication).



<p>During the late twenties and early thirties Gerson had several experiences

which informed his later thinking on diet and degenerative disease. As a

member of the State Board of Health, appointed by the Prussian government, he

was given extraordinary laboratory support for a clinical trial of diet in

pulmonary tuberculosis.  Besides the physiological parameters customarily

monitored in such work, Gerson was able to track minute fluctuations in the

patients' mineral metabolism and also in the chemical composition of the foods

he prescribed (Gerson, 1958, 183). At this same period he served as consultant

to the Prussian Ministry of Health on the best ways to restore to agricultural

usefulness the exhausted soil around several major German cities (Gerson,

1958, 183). When he learned that modern farming methods often rob plant foods

of their natural mineral and vitamin riches, while increasing their sodium

content, he began to think of the earth's well-being as central to our own.

Eventually he began to refer to the soil, which nourishes the food we eat, as

our "external metabolism" (Gerson 1958, 175). 



<p>It was in 1928 that Gerson first used his diet in cancer, at the insistence of

a woman who had jaundice, high fever and two small liver metastases after

unsuccessful surgery for cancer of the bile duct (Gerson, 1958, 31). On the

strength of reports she had heard of Gerson's work with tuberculosis, this

woman insisted that he write out a diet for the treatment of her cancer.

Gerson reluctantly agreed - after he obtained her signed statement that she

would not hold him responsible for the outcome!  As he recalled it many years

later, this same patient had him read aloud to her a chapter called "The

Healing of Cancer" from a big book of about 1200 pages on folk medicine, "

edited by three schoolteachers and one physician, none of them practitioners.

It was from this source that Gerson first learned of the special soup which

Hippocrates supposedly gave to cancer patients and which Gerson made a fixture

of his cancer Therapy (Gerson, 1958, 31, 403-404; Gerson, 1978, 449-450).

Having taken up this challenge against his will, with no hope of success,

Gerson was astounded when his patient seemed fully recovered within six months

(Gerson, 1958, 405). In quick succession he had the same good results with two

patients with inoperable stomach cancer, both referred by this first patient.

Late in life he continues to marvel at these apparent recoveries under his

diet treatment (Gerson, 1958, 404- 405). (These notable histories, which

Gerson recounted in some detail, have prompted one recent researcher to

suggest the possible involvement of aldoslerone as the mechanism of

mineral-corticoid sensitivity in gastrointestinal tumors.  See McCarty, 1981).



<p>In Vienna, where he lived for a time after the rise of Hitler, Gerson's

treatment failed in all seven patients he attempted to treat in this manner -

a failure which, in later years, he attributed to inadequate dietary

provisions in the sanitarium where he then worked (Gerson, 1958, 31-32, 405).

In Paris, where he lived in 1935-36, the diet produced good results in three

out of seven cases (Gerson, 1958, 32, 405; Gerson, 1978, 451), inspiring him

to pursue such treatment further after he emigrated to the United States in

1938.



<p>Gerson constantly sought explanations for his observations in the scientific

literature, where he read widely in several languages (Gerson, 1958). In 1954,

in "Cancer, a Problem of Metabolism," he credited J. Maisin (1923) and B.

Fischer-Wasels (1929) with advancing physiological explanations of general

predisposition toward tumor formation and abandoning the theory of cancer

causation by local irritation.  For the next few decades (according to

Gerson's account of the evolution of cancer concepts) there was a tendency to

interpret cancer in terms of constitution and diathesis, as was done with

diabetes, gout and tuberculosis. It was Caspari (Nutrition and Cancer, 1938)

who turned to metabolic explanation of the kind Gerson ultimately favored

(Gerson, 1954, 1). He devoted an entire chapter of his book to a review of

efforts, largely by German researchers, to alter metabolism by diet (Gerson,

1958, 89-104). He found special appeal in Otto Warburg, The Metabolism of

Tumors, (London, 1930), in G. von Bergmann's Funktionelle Pathologie (Berlin,

1932), and in Frederick Hoffman's massive compilation, Cancer and Diet

(Baltimore, 1937).  Gradually, out of his bedside experience and his reading,

he formed a unitary theory of degenerative disease (including cancer) which

rested on one of the oldest and most pervasive concepts in the history of

medicine: the vis medicatrix naturae or healing power of nature (Neuburger,

1926 and 1944; Warner, 1978). Endlessly seeking out the latest researches and

theories in physiology, biochemistry, and - increasingly - immunology, Gerson

rapidly integrated these massive bodies of new detail into the larger

framework of what he called "the physician within", that is, the natural powers of resistance,
which we today call the immune system.



<p>Gerson believed that cancer changes the body's normal sodium/potassium

balance, already disturbed by modern diet. Thus his therapy used foods low in

sodium (no salt added), high in potassium, and rich in vitamins A and C and

oxidizing enzymes. He excluded fats and dairy products for the first four to

six weeks, considering them dangerously burdensome to the digestion in the

extremely sick patients who usually came to him only after having exhausted

conventional measures.  Above all it was essential for patients to eliminate

excess sodium, which Gerson believed responsible for altering cellular

electrochemistry in favor of cancerous growth.



<p>There is now a great deal of research suggesting possible mechanisms for the

efficacy of Gerson's high potassium/low sodium diet. As he suspected and we

now know, hypokalemia often accompanies cancer of the colon, and alterations

in electrical and mineral states occur often in cancer patients (Newell, 1981,

87). Cone has furnished experimental proof of a correlation between the level

of electrical potential across somatic cell membranes and the intensity of

mitotic activity (Cone, 1971 ), a finding supported by Zs.-Nagy and his

colleagues in studies so human thyroid cancer (Zs. -Nagy, 1983) .  Ling's

association/induction hypothesis is based on laboratory studies which show

that damaged cells partially return to their normal configuration in high

potassium/low sodium environments (Ling, 1943), perhaps explaining the

remarkable tissue repair which Gerson sometimes saw in his formerly

debilitated patients (Cope, 1978). Lai has suggested that intracellular sodium

and potassium levels may furnish the mechanism for regulating cellular

differentiation and transformation (Lai, 1985) .



<p>To supply active oxidation enzymes and potassium-rich minerals, Gerson's

patients drank hourly glasses of freshly prepared vegetable and fruit juices.

As early as 1933-34, while living in Vienna, Gerson had begun giving

injections of liver extract, as another means of stimulating the patient's

liver (Gerson, 1958, 31 -32).  In later years he had patients drink two to

three glasses daily of the juice of calves' liver pressed with carrots.  In

addition to beta-carotene/vitamin A, this would supply iron and copper, both

of which affect peripheral T cell functions and other peripheral lymphocyte

subpopulations (Keusch, 1983, 345- 347).  



<p>Although the AMA Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry labeled as a "false notion"

the idea that diet can affect cancer, recent researchers have found that

"nutritional status plays a critical role in immunological defense mechanisms

at a number of important levels" (Keusch, 1983, 345) and that nutritional

factors "can have profound influences on ... the development and

manifestations of cancers" as well as other diseases (Good, 1982, 85). In "The

Cancerostatic Effect of Vegetarian Diets" ( 1983), Siguel describes as the

ideal way to strengthen bodily defenses against neoplastic cells a diet

similar to Gerson's: high in carbohydrates and vegetables, low in protein.


<p>Like von Bergmann, Gerson believed that "every defense and healing power of

the body depends on the capacity of the body to produce a so-called 'allergic

inflammation'"- a truth long recognized by surgeons, but somehow forgotten by

medicine during the heyday of microbiology.  To Gerson this capacity to

produce inflammation was "the decisive part of the body's 'weapon of healing

power'" (Gerson, 1958, 127-28).



<p>Noting that fluid from a normal inflammation metabolism kills cancer cells,

but that blood serum does not, von Bergmann concluded that a cancer metabolism

occurs when the body can no longer produce this healing inflammatory reaction

(Gerson, 1958, 120- 121 ). Gerson agreed, but in contrast to von Bergmann and

most of his contemporaries, Gerson believed it was often possible for the

physician to help restore the vital power of inflammation, even in anergic

patients with advanced cancer. If cancer was a degenerative disease caused by

the cumulative effect of inadequate nutrition with foods grown in soils

depleted by artificial fertilizers and poisoned by toxic insecticides and

herbicides, doctors must respond by replenishing the entire human organism.

For a condition that represented an ultimate failure of equilibrium in a

poisoned metabolism, removal of tumors by surgery or radiation was merely

superficial, symptomatic treatment.  "Medicine," Gerson said, "must be able to

adapt its therapeutic methods to the damages of the processes of our modern

civilization" (Gerson, 1958, 199).



<p>Gerson set about doing this by altering the basic diet he had used earlier in

other conditions. Through meticulous observation of his patients in New York

(where he passed state boards in 1939), he perfected a regimen of detoxication

and diet requiring a high degree of compliance by the patient, heroic devotion

by the patient's family, and close attention and frequent adjustment by the

physician.  His therapy aimed to detoxify the body and restore its healing

apparatus, especially the liver, the visceral nervous system, and the

reticulo-mesenchymal system.



<p>Gerson first encountered the idea of detoxication in cancer in the version of

Hippocratic regimen which he read with his first cancer patient in Bielefeld

in 1928 (Gerson, 1958, 404). After losing several cancer patients to hepatic

coma rather than to direct effects of the disease (Gerson, 1958, 191 ), he

realized that "The digestive tract is very much poisoned in cancer'.  The

liver and pancreas failed to function: "nothing is active" (Gerson, 1958,

407). To stimulate the liver, he began to use coffee enemas, which 0.A.  Meyer

of Goettingen had found effective in opening the bile ducts in animals and

which American surgeons in that period were using in acute adrenal

insufficiency and in shock from postoperative hemorrhage and bleeding peptic

ulcer (Beeson, 1980, 90, 96; Rothstein, 1987, 124). As he watched the progress

of his patients, he found that he could accelerate detoxication by giving

coffee enemas more frequently, with the addition of castor oil, by mouth and

by rectum (Gerson, 1958, 81).



<p>Although Gerson used caffeine enemas primarily to facilitate excretion of

toxic wastes, especially from necrosing tumors, we now realize that these

enemas also promoted the absorption of vitamin A, a process requiring the

action of bile acids (Simone, 1943, 64). Thus the enemas that brought ridicule

from Gerson's enemies actually enabled his patients to use the enormous

amounts of vitamin A which his diet provided (recently estimated at about

100,000 IU daily: see Seifter, 1988). Vitamin A, in turn, plays a vital role

in immune function, perhaps by causing the helper cells to induce the

production of interleukin-2, or by causing killer cell precursors to activate

cytotoxic mechanisms, or by causing suppressor T cells to eliminate down

regulation (Keusch, 1983, 330-331 ).



<p>Gerson also found that caffeine enemas greatly reduce pain, a particular boon

in his regimen, which avoids the use of opiates and other painkilling drugs

that might overtax the liver at a time when its limited capacity is needed for

immune functions and for eliminating the toxic products of tumor breakdown.




<p>Although the AMA Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry labeled as a "false notion"

the idea that diet can affect cancer, recent researchers have found that

"nutritional status plays a critical role in immunological defense mechanisms

at a number of important levels" (Keusch, 1983, 345) and that nutritional

factors "can have profound influences on ... the development and

manifestations of cancers" as well as other diseases (Good, 1982, 85). In "The

Cancerostatic Effect of Vegetarian Diets" ( 1983), Siguel describes as the

ideal way to strengthen bodily defenses against neoplastic cells a diet

similar to Gerson's: high in carbohydrates and vegetables, low in protein.



<p>Gerson gradually added a few medications to his diet.  One of these was

niacin, which he believed would help restore proper intracellular potential,

raise depleted liver stores of glycogen and potassium, and aid in protein

metabolism (Gerson, 1958, 32, 99- 100, 209). Another was iodine, which Gerson

initially used only in cases of low metabolic rates. When he found that "The

best range of healing power" was a BMR of +6 to +8 (monitored by organic

iodine in blood serum), and that iodine seemed to counteract the neoplastic

effect of hormones, he incorporated iodine into the basic regimen, at first in

the form of thyroid extract, later as inorganic Lugol's solution (iodine plus

potassium iodide) (Gerson, 1958, 32, 409; U.S. Congress, 1946, 114).  Several

researchers have showed that thyroid raises natural resistance to infection by

augmenting the power of reticuloendothelial cells and by increasing antibody

formation - thus supporting Gerson's hunch that iodine was a decisive factor

in the normal differentiation of cells (Lurie, 1960; Thorbecke, 1962).



<p>Despite the fact that he had no inpatient facility until 1946, when he opened

a clinic in Nanuet, New York, Gerson managed, through his thriving Park Avenue

practice and an affiliation at Gotham Hospital, to amass enough data to

publish a preliminary report in 1945. He presented his rather remarkable case

histories modestly, concluding that he did not yet have enough evidence to say

whether diet could either influence the origin of cancer or alter the course

of an established tumor. He claimed only that the diet, which he described in

considerable detail, could favorably affect the patient's general condition,

staving off the consequences of malignancy and making further treatment

possible (Gerson, 1945).



<p>Gerson may have struck an Establishment nerve with his statement that many

physicians use surgery and/or radiation "without systematic treatment of the

patient as a whole" (Gerson, 1945, 419). But it seems more likely that it was

his growing success in practice, or perhaps even his opposition to tobacco,

that first drew the wrath of organized medicine.  ( Philip Morris was then

JAMA's major source of advertising revenue: see Rorty, 1939, 182 - 194).



<p>In any case the AMA did not openly attack Gerson until November 1946, a few

months after he testified in support of a Senate bill to appropriate $100

million to bring together the world's outstanding cancer experts in order to

coordinate a search for the prevention and cure of cancer. At hearings before

Senator Claude Pepper's sub-committee in July 1946, Gerson demonstrated

recovered patients who had come to him after conventional methods could no

longer help.  Dr.  George Miley, medical director of the 85-bed Gotham

Hospital, where Gerson had treated patients since January, 1946, gave strong

supporting medical testimony (U.S. Congress, 1946).



<p>In a surly editorial response, JAMA said it was "fortunate" that this Senate

appearance received little newspaper publicity; the AMA was clearly outraged

that Gerson's appearance had become the subject of a favorable radio

commentary, broadcast nationwide by ABC's Raymond Gram Swing (U.S. Congress,

1946, 31-35; JAMA, 1946). The JAMA editorial focused on Gerson, even though it

was not Gerson but a lay witness, immune to AMA retaliation, who had called

Gerson's successes "miracles" and urged the Senators to secure their future

cancer commission against control by any existing medical organization (U.S.

Congress, 1946, 96,97).



<p>It was not Gerson, but Dr. Miley, who told the Senators that a long-term

survey by a well-known and respected physician showed that those who received

no cancer treatment lived longer than those who received surgery, radiation or

X-ray (U.S. Congress, 1946, 117).  Perhaps because Miley was a Northwestern

medical graduate, an established physician licensed in four states, and a

fellow of the AMA and state and county societies of Pennsylvania and New York,

Morris Fishbein did not attack him personally.  Instead, he limited himself to

intimations of fiscal impropriety in the Robinson Foundation, which owned

Miley's Gotham Hospital, and to the scandalous revelation that the director of

the section on health education of this Foundation (which was promoting "an

unestablished, somewhat questionable method of treating cancer") was not an

M.D. at all, but a Yale University professor of economics!



<p>Compared to Miley's testimony, Gerson's was innocent, concentrating on the

histories of the patients he brought with him and on the likely mechanisms

whereby his diet caused tumor regression and healing.  Only under pressure

from Senator Pepper did Gerson state that about 30% of those he treated showed

a favorable response ( U.S.  Congress, 1946, 115).  Nonetheless, JAMA devoted

two pages to undermining Gerson's integrity (JAMA, 1946). Showing no restraint

where Gerson was concerned, Fishbein, contrary to fact, alleged that successes

with the Gerson-Sauerbruch-Hermannsdorfer diet "were apparently not

susceptible of duplication by most other observers. " He also falsely claimed

that Gerson had several times refused to supply the AMA with details of the

diet. (Fishbein said he could provide them in this editorial only because

"there has come to hand through a prospective patient" of Gerson a diet

schedule for his treatment.)  Fishbein emphasized, without comment, Gerson's

caution about the use of other medications, especially anesthetics, because

they produced dangerously strong reactions in the heightened allergic state of

his most responsive patients.



<p>Fishbein attempted to tie together this strange patchwork of slurs against

Gerson and against research supported by lay-dominated industrial corporations

with his accustomed mastery of innuendo: "The entire performance, including

the financial backing, the promotion and the scientific reports, has a

peculiar effluvium which, to say the least, is distasteful and, at its worst,

creates doubt and suspicion" (JAMA, 1946, 646).



<p>Through no fault of his own, Gerson was again portrayed favorably in the news

in 1947, when John Gunther, in Death Be Not Proud, credited Gerson with

extending the life of Gunther's son during the boy's ultimately unsuccessful

struggle with brain cancer. Beginning that same year the New York County

Medical Society staged five "investigations" of Gerson and eventually

suspended him for "advertising" his "secret" methods.



<p>At this point Gerson's life took on a nightmare quality. The Pepper-Neely bill

met defeat and, with it, the hope for coordinated cancer research free of

prior restraints against investigations of anything other than "established"

methods. In 1949 the AMA Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, in a report

entitled "Cancer and the Need for Facts", rehashed material from the earlier

editorial, adding that the Gerson diet was "lacking in essential protein and

fat" and that Gerson's concern about the dangers of anesthesia was "wholly

unfounded and apparently designed to appeal to the cancer victim already

fearful of a surgical operation which might offer the only effective means for

eradication of the disease".  Without benefit of either a literature search or

new clinical or laboratory research, the Council labeled as a "false notion"

the idea that "diet has any specific influence on the origin or progress of

cancer". They concluded that "There is no scientific evidence whatsoever to

indicate that modifications in the dietary intake of food or other nutritional

essentials are of any specific value in the control of cancer" (Council on

Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1949, 96). Gerson lost his hospital affiliation and

found that young doctors who wanted to assist him and learn from him could not

do so, for fear of incurring Society discipline.  He was denied malpractice

insurance, because his therapy was not "accepted practice" (Moss, 1980, 178;

Natenberg, 1959, 136).



<p>In the early fifties Gerson submitted five case histories to the NCI,

requesting an official investigation.  He was told that they would need 25

cases, which he promptly supplied, with full documentation.  More than a year

later the NCI demanded 125 case histories, saying that the 25 they had

previously requested were insufficient to justify investigation.



<p>According to a 1981 publication of the Gerson Institute, headed by his

daughter, Charlotte Gerson, a manuscript for a book he was writing about his

therapy disappeared from his files in 1956 (Healing, 1981, 19) At the age of

75, isolated from medical colleagues and unable to find assistants, Gerson

undertook the work of rewriting the entire manuscript in order to show "that

there is an effective treatment of cancer, even in advanced cases" (Gerson,

1958, 3). It was published in 1958, as A Cancer Therapy: Results of Fifty

Cases. Gerson died of pneumonia the following year, before finishing a second

volume. His ideas have gained wide distribution through subsequent editions of

his book (1975, 1977, and 1986); through a 1962 publication called Has Dr. Max

Gerson a True Cancer Cure?, which had reportedly sold more than 250,000 copies

by 1980 (Moss, 1980, 178); and through the publications and physician-training

programs of the Gerson Institute in Bonita, California, and the Hospital de

Baja California.



<p>In 1980 a reformed JAMA carried a commentary called "The 'Grand Conspiracy'

Against the Cancer Cure" by William Regelson of the Department of Medicine of

the Medical College of Virginia. Surveying a series of "inappropriate

judgments [that] have resulted in injury to good observations," Regelson said,

"We may shortly have to ask if Gerson's low-sodium diet, with its bizarre

coffee enemas and thyroid supplementation, was an approach that altered the

mitotic regulating effect of intracellular sodium for occasional clinical

validity in those patients with the stamina to survive it" (Regelson, 1980,

338).



<p>Disregarding such suggestions and resting its case instead on the claim that

the NCI had "found no convincing evidence of effectiveness" during a review of

ten Gerson cases some forty years earlier, the American Cancer Society in 1987

stated that "The Gerson method of cancer treatment is not considered a proven

means of cancer treatment, and on the basis of available information, the

Institute does not believe that further evaluation of this therapy is called

for at this time" (American Cancer Society, February 5, 1987).



<p>Testing is underway, however, outside of the U.S. Since 1984 a modified form

of Gerson's therapy has been in use at the Second Department of Surgery of the

Krankenhaus in Graz, Austria.  Omitting liver juice and niacin, using thyroid

only in hypothyroid patients, and limiting caffeine enemas to two per day,

Peter Lechner and his colleagues, all of them surgeons, have been testing the

Gerson method as an adjunct, often with chemotherapy or radiation, in 60

post-operative cancer patients, male and female, ranging in age from 23 to 74,

and representing many different forms of cancer. By pairing each patient who

was willing to use the Gerson method (GP) with one of similar age and

condition who chose not to try it (NGP) and observing the comparative progress

of the disease in the two groups over a four-year period, Lechner and his

colleagues have approximated a controlled study of admittedly imperfect

structure (Lechner, 198 7).



<p>Their findings show that the Gerson therapy made a notable difference in

several forms of cancer. Although GPs with bone metastases had no better

survival or tumor response than NGPs, their relief from pain and absence of

hypercalcemia made for a better quality of life.  GPs with lung metastases

required fewer procedures to relieve pleural effusion. GPs with brain

metastases experienced decreased edema and lived four months longer than their

paired NGPs.  Premenopausal and perimenopausal breast cancer GPs tolerated

conventional treatments better, with fewer side effects; showed better liver

and kidney function and blood counts; and had fewer local recurrences and no

metastases.  Breast cancer GPs with liver metastases tolerated chemotherapy

better, and one of three has been in a steady state for more than a year,

while the remaining five have died.  GPs with colorectal carcinoma seemed to

gain weight and recover better after surgery, but showed no significant

difference in incidence of secondaries or local recurrence. The best

responders to date are GPs with liver metastases, with two GPs showing

improved hepatic enzyme profiles compared to two NGPs; in four other pairs,

although profiles remained similar, the GPs lived twice as long as the NGPs

(Lechner, 1987).



<p>It is an irony of both history and geography that the first comparative study

of Max Gerson's therapy should take place at the hands of surgeons, in that

part of the world which Gerson fled as a Jewish refugee half a century ago and

that the results, while not so outstanding as those he seemed able to produce,

are most encouraging in patients with severe damage to the liver, the organ he

considered central to recovery.

<LI><B>Objective</B> - Compare 5-year melanoma survival rates to rates in medical literature

<LI><B>Design</B> - Retrospective.

<LI><B>Setting</B> - Hospital in Tijuana, Mexico.

<LI><B>Patients</B> - White adult patients (N=153) with superficial spreading and nodular melanoma, aged 25-72 years.

<LI><B>Intervention</B> - Gerson's diet therapy: lactovegetarian; low sodium, fat and (temporarily) protein; high potassium, fluid, and nutrients (hourly raw vegetable/fruit juices). Metabolism increased by thyroid; calorie supply limited to 2600-3200 cal
ories per day. Coffee enemas as needed for pain and appetite.

<LI><B>Main Outcome Measure</B> - 5-year survival rates by stage at admission.

<LI><B>Results</B> - Of 14 patients with stages I and II (localized) melanoma, 100% survived for 5 years, compared with 79% of 15,798 reported by Balch. Of 17 with stage IIIA (regionally metastasized)

melanoma, 82% were alive at 5 years, in contrast to 39% of 103 from Fachklinik Hornheide. Of 33 with combined stages IIIA + IIIB (regionally metastasized) melanoma, 70% lived 5 years, compared with

41% of 130 from Fachklinik Hornheide. We propose a new stage division: IVA (distant lymph, skin, and subcutaneous tissue metastases), and IVB (visceral metastases). Of 18 with stage IVA melanoma, 39% were alive at 5 years, compared with only 6% of 194 fro
m the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group. Survival impact was not assessed for stage IVB. Male and female survival rates were identical for stages I-IIIB, but stage IVA women had a strong survival advantage.

<LI><B>Conclusions</B> - The 5-year survival rates reported here are considerably higher than those reported elsewhere. Stage IIIA/B males had exceptionally high survival rates compared with those reported by other centers. (Alternative Therapies in Healt
h and Medicine.  1995;1(4):29-37)

</UL>

<P>This article summarizes the clinical outcomes of melanoma patients treated with the nutrition-based cancer therapy proposed by the German physician Gerson[1] (who conducted research at the University

of Munich in the 1930s) and contrasts them with rates reported in the literature. To our knowledge, this report is the most thorough retrospective analysis to date of the potential survival benefit of this, or any other, well-known alternative method of c
ancer management.  

<P>The genesis of this inquiry occurred during a landmark study by the US Congressional Office of Technology Assessment (OTA)[2] to which one of us (GH) was an advisor. In its report, OTA put forward a protocol for best-case reviews based on the premise t
hat, no matter how many patients failed, as few as 10 or 12 cases with objective evidence of tumor response would be enough to propel an investigation by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Because we had proposed the original best-case review protocol t
o OTA, we were eager to construct such a review. However, we found OTA's (and later NCI's) protocol to have a serious shortcoming when used retrospectively: its focus on tumor regression only. Adequate documentation of tumor regression is unlikely to be c
ollected in most alternative medical practices.  

<P>We abandoned the best-case review for the more informative retrospective review. In contrast to the best-case review, the retrospective review describes all patients, including nonresponders, giving a more adequate impression of the outcomes of treatme
nt.   

<P>Our efforts to complete a best-case review, however, were not without some rewards. Practitioners at Centro Hospitalario Internacional del Pacifico, SA (CHIPSA) in Playas de Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico suggested cases with different types of  canc
er they believed had unusually positive outcomes. Of the 27 cases cataloged, 33% were long-term melanoma survivors, which underscored the need to do a more complete evaluation of melanoma per se.

<P>In the process, we determined that the institutions at which the patients were originally diagnosed were reliable. We requested histological specimens for the above 27 cases, and forwarded the numbered slides, without clinical histories, to the Armed F
orces Institute of Pathology (AFIP). AFIP pathologists' findings agreed with those reported by the original institutions with the exception of one specimen, which had been destroyed by improper handling and storage. In a related exercise, original diagnos
tic scans were read by contemporary UCLA physicians, whose interpretations were in virtually complete agreement with those of the original readers. 

<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>METHODS</B></FONT>

<P>Over 15 years, from 1975 through July 1990, 249 patients presented for treatment of melanoma; however, 53 (21%) were lost to follow-up. Survival outcomes were learned for the other 196, but 14

were excluded because they did not have verified nodular or superficial spreading melanoma. Of the remaining 182, 29 (19%) charts could not be assessed for stage at admission. Therefore, this paper is based on the outcomes of 153 adult melanoma patients t
reated with Gerson's nutrition-based cancer therapy. All assessable patients were white. Almost all were hospitalized by CHIPSA physicians, but several were treated by physicians in private practice. Medical charts supplied by CHIPSA were consolidated fro
m three predecessor facilities, Hospital la Gloria, Hospital Jardines la Mesa, and

Hospital del Sol, all from the Tijuana metropolitan area.

<P>Gerson is credited with the introduction and development of therapeutic sodium (Na+) restriction[3] in the context of a high potassium (K+) diet, which was first broadly tested in refractory cutaneous tuberculosis (lupus vulgaris)[4] According to emine
nt dermatologist Erich Urbach[5], the majority of authors of note investigated and approved Gerson's diet therapy for lupus.  Emerson[6] was the first US author to refer to the diet as a metabolic therapy. Gerson's tuberculosis diet became the basis of a 
number of quite different dietotherapies he developed for conditions as diverse as pulmonary tuberculosis and cardiorenal insufficiency.

<P>The cancer management employed by CHIPSA was developed empirically by Gerson over the course of 30 years of clinical experimentation[7].  Gradually, by trial and error, Gerson evolved an integrated set of medical treatments, which he last published in 
a 1958 monograph along with 50 cases presented in clinical detail[8].

<P>Although Gerson's method was published several times in US[9] and German[10-12] refereed journals, it is not well known by most practitioners and researchers. Therefore, a brief description of the development and nature of the therapy may be useful.

<P>During the 1930s, Gerson's research at the University of Munich was afforded extraordinary laboratory support through funding provided by both the Bavarian and Prussian federal governments[13]. Gerson focused on the experimental use of diet and medicat
ions to improve tissue edema occurring in a variety of pathologies. Edema is characterized by salt and water changes that Cope[14] has defined as tissue damage syndrome--decreased cell K+, increased cell Na+, and increased cell water (cell swelling) --cha
nges that are also observed after death[15].  Nutritional treatment to provide cells with a high K+, low Na+ environment improved edema and led to enhanced tissue resistance and immunities, and therefore better outcomes[16].  This rationale can be traced 
through all of Gerson's subsequent efforts in cancer management. [8(pp164, 166, 184, 197)]

<P>The cancer diet is individualized to meet the needs of every patient, but it does have uniform components. For most patients, it is restricted in salt, fat, and (temporarily) protein. It supplies very high quantities of many nutrients and phytochemical
s while at the same time forcing fluids through 13 hourly feedings of raw fruit and vegetable juices daily. About half of the melanoma subjects in this study received 24 ounces daily of raw veal liver and carrot juice (each glass contained the pressings o
f 1/2 pound of liver and 3/4 pound of carrots). Following numerous disruptions in supplies that began in late 1985, raw veal liver was formally discontinued in 1987 because of repeated instances of bacterial contamination (Campylobacter fetus s. fetus). C
omparisons of patients from different time frames indicate that those receiving liver juice experienced better survival outcomes overall[15].

<P>Gerson restricted calories while simultaneously increasing metabolism in an effort to emulate the antitumor effect of calorie restriction per se, first demonstrated by Moreschi[18] and Rous[19]. Enhanced caloric utilization rates (metabolism) can alter
 tumor growth, whether metabolism is accelerated by iodine medications[20]  (Gerson used thyroid and Lugol's iodine solution) or exercise[21]. The caloric supply is limited to 2600-3200 calories per day by the low-fat, lactovegetarian diet served in three
 generous daily meals. Niacin, potassium salts (acetate, gluconate, and monophosphate), and crude liver extract with vitamin B12 injectable, were given to support accelerated cellular energy production.

<P>In the University of Munich experiments, Gerson found that temporary protein restriction aided edema absorption[22] and favored improvement in his patients. In Gerson's cancer diet, protein repletion with nonfat cultured dairy products occurs after at 
least 6 weeks in most cases. Shorter periods of protein restriction are recommended for children and elderly patients.

<P>Castor oil, a cathartic with no known clinical side effects, was administered every other day for many weeks. Retention enemas medicated with boiled coffee were taken as needed, as frequently as every 4 hours throughout the day and night, for their obs
erved ability to alleviate pain and to improve nutritional condition. Peter Lechner observed statistically significant cancer pain relief from coffee enemas in a prospective matched control trial at the University Hospital of Graz, Austria[23]. Although t
he mechanism of pain relief is not known, Cope[7] suggested it may be the result of a crude sort of dialysis across the gut wall for tumor breakdown products such as polyamines, toxic bound nitrogen, and ammonia. Lechner and Kronberger[24] have also obser
ved improved tolerance of aggressive conventional treatments in patients who employed Gerson's therapy at the same time. At CHIPSA, the therapy was prescribed for 18 to 36 months, subject to the physician's judgment and pati!

ent response.

<P>This study, because of its retrospective nature, makes no attempt to adjust for variables such as mind-body treatments or adjuvant botanical or homeopathic materials (although it is our impression that such treatments were commonly used). We know of on
ly two cases in which nonsurgical conventional treatments were employed concurrently with the Gerson treatment: 2 stage IVA patients, both 5-year survivors, added adjuvant biological response modifiers (One employed interferon for 6 months, and the other 
used levamisole). Several patients whose disease had escaped surgical management before

admission to the Gerson program required one or more surgeries during treatment.

<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>DATA COLLECTION</B></FONT>

<P>To begin, we reviewed all records, files, and lists at our disposal from Hospitals La Gloria, La Mesa, Del Sol, CHIPSA, and the Gerson Institute in San Diego. In cases for which original patient phone and address records were no longer valid, we went t
o stored financial charts in which were found records of collect telephone calls placed by patients to friends and relatives. We used those additional numbers with considerable success to locate living patients and to learn the fate of the deceased. We we
re also able to extend our search by employing the epidemiological services of Equifax Credit Information Services. In 1993 the Gerson Research Organization began publishing a free newsletter for current and past patients, who were invited to join a suppo
rt network. They were encouraged to share with all patients, even if they had not been treated by CHIPSA physicians. Through this route, several independently treated patients were discovered, contacts were established with !

their physicians, and data were collected and used in this study.

<P>Because ours is a groundbreaking effort among various alternative forms of cancer management, we believe that explanation of our documentation process is warranted. Two standards of documentation

were applied: one for survivors and one for deceased patients. 

<P>Forty-five survivor charts were meticulously cataloged to include independent histological verification, previous physicians' notes, surgical summaries, and radiological interpretations. In addition, our own physician notes, extended care consultation 
records, periodic laboratory reports, roentgenograms and scans as well as medication purchase records and other evidence of compliance, were included. Charts for 5 survivors could not be sufficiently cataloged to assess staging at admission, even though t
hey did contain adequate evidence of the presence of melanoma.

<P>For purposes of this evaluation, we operated under two assumptions regarding deceased patients: (1) the majority probably achieved some measure of compliance with the Gerson treatment, and (2) the cause of death for the majority was probably melanoma. 
Mortality data are being assembled to address these assumptions if possible.

<P>In staging the deceased, we allowed less stringent documentation to suffice, with the understanding that the negative outcomes were probably due to melanoma. Fifty-seven charts of deceased patients contained independent confirmation of staging by their
 previous physicians, the standard of evidence required for all survivor charts in this study. In contrast, 44 were staged by relying on the admitting physician's oral history and physical examination. Beyond this, questionnaire responses and corresponden
ce were considered to provide adequate information for 7 patients whose charts could not be located.  

<P>Such lower-level documentation (admission oral history and physical examinations, and the questionnaire responses) was considered acceptable only for charts of deceased patients whose disease had apparently progressed. If we have erred in this judgment
, it was on the side of caution.  Because physicians administering the Gerson cancer therapy did not make exhaustive staging efforts on admission for any of their melanoma patients, the possibility certainly exists that deceased patients may have  develop
ed undetected distant and internal metastases before admission; in fact, this possibility cannot be ruled out for the survivors.  With these criteria, 108 charts of the deceased were assessable for stage at

admission.

<P>Twenty-four charts were missing, presumably destroyed in the La Gloria Hospital fire of 1985 in which approximately 900 charts of all different pathologies were lost. Two cases for which outcomes had been documented (Both were noted deceased in a Gerso
n Institute file index) were identified by initials only, with no gender markers. Survival outcomes are known for 72 women and 81 men; 42 (58%) women and 69 (85%) men are deceased, a finding consistent with the female survival advantage widely reported in
 the melanoma literature. Two deceased men and 1 deceased woman (all stage III) lived 5 or more years and are reflected in this report as 5-year survivors.

<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>STATISTICAL METHODS</B></FONT>

<P>Charts of 153 patients were assessable for both outcome and stage at admission. Five-year survival rates for each stage were compared with rates previously published by Balch[25], Drepper et al (the American Cancer Society)[26], Ryan et al (the Eastern
 Cooperative Oncology Group)[27], and Fawzy[28].  For most comparisons, we used the chi-square test; when comparing small samples, we employed Fisher's Exact Test. For the above tests, we employed a computer program, SigmaStat, by Jandel Scientific Softwa
re. Programs were created (by SC) to generate Kaplan- Meier survival functions. Survival curves were plotted using Harvard Graphics. Cox regressions and log-rank tests for homogeneity of survival curves were used for comparison of data.

<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>STAGING USED IN THIS REPORT</B></FONT>

<P>Because so many different staging systems exist for nodular and superficial spreading malignant melanoma, we have provided a breakdown of the staging criteria we used in Table 1. We borrowed from current international standards of the TNM (tumor, node,
 metastasis) system for melanoma as published by the American Joint Committee on Cancer[29] as well as the more precise staging divisions for micrometastases as published by the Union Internationale Contre le Cancer (UICC), or International Union Against 
Cancer[30]. Both of these methods incorporate Clark levels (tissue invasion) and the Breslow index (tumor thickness).

<P>The recent reclassification of melanoma staging emphasizes micrometastases and has, therefore, caused considerable stage migration. Many melanoma tumors that would previously have been categorized as stage IIB have moved to stage III. Stage III has bee
n expanded and divided into stages IIIA and IIIB. The net effect of this reclassification, from our point of view, is an amplification of the survival benefit of lifestyle management as represented by the Gerson cancer treatment. In this paper, we have pr
esented our findings with a proposed new division of stage IV into two parts. We believe that our findings support this proposal.

<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>RESULTS</B></FONT>

<P>The primary purpose of our study was to assess survival outcomes as measured by 5-year survival rates by stage, which are summarized in Table 2. Of 249 potential melanoma patients identified from lists and files of the above mentioned organizations, su
rvival outcomes were learned for 196 (79%), whereas 53 (21%) were lost to follow-up. Stage at admission was assessable in 167 cases (85%), whereas in 29 (15%) it was not.

<P><B>Table 2</B>  5-year survival rates by most clinically important disease (TNM)

<P><IMG SRC="table2.gif">

<P>Of 14 patients (8%) who were excluded, 3 did not have malignant melanoma (2 had melanoma in situ, and 1 had a history of melanoma). One case of pediatric melanoma was excluded because of its unique

nature. Ten cases of ocular melanoma (2 surviving, a deceased), which has different staging criteria and is not directly comparable to either nodular melanoma or the superficial spreading type, were also excluded. Superficial and nodular melanoma become c
omparable with the use of Clark levels and the Breslow index[24].

<P>After exclusions, a total of 153 patients were included in this review; 45 (29%) lived at least 5 years (41 of whom were alive at this writing), and 108 (71%) were known to be deceased.  Survival rates within the Gerson system are clearly stage-related
 (Table 3). A log-rank test for homogeneity of Kaplan-Meier survival curves for early (localized) versus late (regionally or distantly metastasized) disease (Figure 1) revealed that the difference was statistically significant (P=.007). However, as will b
e seen below, survival rates for men and women do not differ until distant (beyond the primary lymphatic drainage system- stage IV) metastases have presented.



<P><B>Table 3</B>  Survival rates by stage (percent)

<P><IMG SRC="table3.gif">

<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>STAGES I AND II</B></FONT>

<P>Of the 153 patients assessable for stage at admission 14 (9%) entered the Gerson program with early (stage I or II) melanoma. At admission 4 patients were stage IA, 7 were IB, and 3 were stage II. None suffered progression of melanoma after admission; 
all remained free from melanoma for up to 17 years- 13 were alive at this writing; and I was deceased of other causes.

<P>All of the stage I and II patients reviewed were admitted to the Gerson program before May 1987 and were, therefore, included in the assessment of the 5-year survival rate. All of the 14 early stage melanoma patients remained disease-free for a mini- m
um of 7 1/2 years and a maximum of 17 years. No deaths due to melanoma had occurred in this group as of this writing (although a 74-year-old, 15-year stage II survivor died of prostate cancer).  When contrasted with a meta-analysis of 15,798 stage I and I
I melanoma patients from reporting centers worldwide in which Balch[25] found an overall average 5-year survival rate of 79%, the sample size in the Gerson treatment system was too small for statistical significance (chi-squared=2.56, P=.11). The sample w
ould have to in the context of this study's unusually positive findings for stages III and IVA, these data hint that aggressive lifestyle intervention (e.g., Gerson's therapy) may hold a potential to reduce the world- wide 5!

-year mortality rate for early-stage, localized melanoma. Of the early stage patients in Balch's meta-analysis, 21% (more than 3300) were deceased at 5 years.

<P>It is also of interest that stage I and II patients comprised approximately 88% (15,798 of 17,914) of the melanoma cases reported by centers worldwide, whereas physicians offering the Gerson cancer treatment saw only 9% (14 out of 153) at such an early
 and hopeful stage.



<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>STAGE III</B></FONT>

<P>In all, 35 (23%) of the assessable cases were admitted at stage III. The 5-year survival rate for 35 assessable stage III melanoma patients treated with the Gerson diet therapy is 71%, with 10 deceased before the 5-year mark and 25 cancer-free for at l
east 5 years.

<P>The American Cancer Society has reported a 39% 5-year survival rate for stage III melanoma. Other reported 5-year survival rates[25] range from 27% in Brisbane to 42% at Duke University. Interestingly, no center included in Balch's meta-analysis[25], o
ther than Duke University, reported a 5-year survival rate higher than 37%.  

<P>Drepper et al[26], from the Fachklinik Hornheide, reported a 39% 5-year survival rate (n=103) for patients with stage IIIA (N1 only) melanoma. A comparable group from the Gerson system (n=17) achieved an 82% 5-year rate. The comparison (0.43 difference
 in means), which reveals a 110% greater survival advantage for patients in the Gerson system, is statistically significant (chi-squared=9.48 with 1 df, P=.002, power=.887).

<P>The Fachklinik Hornheide also documented a 41% 5-year survival rate for all (n=134) its stage IIIA (T4b and N1) and stage IIIB (N2 patients). Same-stage patients in the Gerson system (n=33) achieved a 5-year survival rate of 70%. The difference in mean
s (.29) is statistically significant (chi-squared=7.62 with 1 df, P<.006, power=.802).



<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>STAGE IVA</B></FONT>

<P>Of the assessable patients, 104 (68%) had a stage tumor at admission. All stage IV survivors in the Gerson program were admitted presenting only superficial metastatic disease (limited to skin, subcutaneous, and lymph involvement) with no internal meta
stases. We believe that these patients represent a responsive subgroup within stage IV, and suggest categorizing such patients separately as stage IVA.

<P>According to Balch, 23% of stage IV patients reported worldwide present first metastases confined to lymph, skin, and subcutaneous tissue (any T, any N, M1). He reports that this group has a median survival of 7.2 months and a 1-year survival rate of 2
5% worldwide. 

<P>Of the stage IV patients admitted to the Gerson program, 18 (17%) were classified M1 (stage IVA); 7 (39%) of 18 were alive at this writing, with a survival range of 5 to 19 years. Therefore, the 5-year survival rate for 18 melanoma patients admitted to
 the Gerson program at stage IVA was 39%.

<P>Ryan et al[27] of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) published an outcomes analysis of 635 advanced-stage melanoma patients in which they offered a breakdown of survival by most significant sites. ECOG showed 11 of 194 patients fitting our s
tage IVA criteria to have lived 5 years, for a 5-year survival rate of 6%27. In contrast, the 5-year survival rate for 7 of 18 stage IVA melanoma patients in the Gerson system was 39% (550%) greater (0.33 difference in mean). This comparison is statistica
lly significant (chi-squared=19.3 with 1 df, P<.0001, power=.997).



<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>STAGE IVB</B></FONT>

<P>We have made no attempt to assess the survival impact of Gerson's cancer therapy in stage IVB. Because there were no exclusion criteria at any of the Gerson treating facilities, we were unable to find a single comparable treatment group moving through 
any other reporting treatment system. Of the 86 patients (56% of the assessable group) admitted to the Gerson program at stage IVB, most had gravely advanced disease. All are deceased, 6 of the deceased were not able to start the Gerson treatment, 6 died 
in the hospital, 1 presented with both melanoma and AIDS, and 14 are known to have had lactate dehydrogenase readings 300% or more above normal at admission. The highest recorded was 3776, or more than 2400% above normal. Major metastases were distributed
 as follows: 26% had brain involvement, 30% had liver tumors, 18% had tumors in abdominal viscera other than the liver, 40% had lung disease, 21% had melanoma in the bone, and 25% exhibited skin tumors.

<P>Only one patient, a female registered nurse originally admitted at stage III, had documented objective radiological evidence of progression to internal (bone) disease (M2, stage IVB) and subsequent complete remission of those lesions. She had been aliv
e and well for 8 years at this writing.



<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>INFLUENCE OF GENDER ON SURVIVAL</B></FONT>

<P>A female survival advantage has been reported widely in the melanoma literature. Although a female survival advantage is seen in the Gerson system (Table 4), male and female 5-year survival rates are not significantly different until stage IVA (distant
 metastases to skin, subcutaneous tissue, and lymph). Male and female survival rates are substantially the same for patients with stage I and II (completely local disease) as well as those with stages IIIA and IIIB (regionally metastasized disease).



<P><B>Table 4</B>  Survival rates by gender (percent)

<P><IMG SRC="table4.gif">

<P>Twelve women and 2 men were admitted with early (stage I and II) melanoma. This shows an unexplained female recruitment bias (6:1) in early-stage patients, which did not occur with any other stage.

<P>Of 35 patients assessed for stage IIIA and IIIB (all primary T4a, primary T4b, N1, and N2) 5-year survival rates, 18 (51%) were male and 17 (49%) were female, a distribution similar to that reported by the Fachklinik Hornheide[26], which had 49% male a
nd 51% female patients. Of those who were cancer-free at 5 years or beyond, 12 were male and 13 were female. Of the deceased, 6 were male and 4 were female.

<P>Comparison of the 67% 5-year survival rate for all stage III men in the Gerson system with the 76% rate for women (0.09 difference in mean) is not statistically significant (Fisher's Exact Test, P=.71). Two of the 12 male 5-year survivors had recurrenc
e of tumors after the 5th year and are deceased. One female 15-year survivor had recurrence of tumors and is deceased. Even at 10 years, although the survival rate for females (63%, n=8) is considerably higher than that for males (50%, n=12), the differen
ce in means (0.13) is not statistically significant (Fisher's Exact Test, P=.49).

<P>Of 18 patients admitted for treatment of stage IVA melanoma, 9 were women and 9 were men. This recruitment pattern, half and half, is consistent with the melanoma literature. Of 7 who survived 5 years, 6 (86%) were female, whereas only 1 (14%) was male
. Although the samples are tiny, the female 5-year survival rate of 67% is statistically significant compared with the male rate of 11% (Fisher's Exact Test, P=.05).

<P>When IVA survival and mortality data are included with data for stages I through IIIB, the Kaplan-Meier survival curves for stage I-IVA male versus female patients (Figure 2) are significantly different (P=.004) when log-rank tested for homogeneity ove
r 5 years.

<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>LIMITATIONS</B></FONT>

<P>It has been repeatedly suggested that patients who use alternative cancer treatments may be different from patients who employ only conventional treatments.  Several differences have been reported by Cassileth et al[31], who found that alternative trea
tment users tended to be white and better educated than those who used only conventional treatments. It remains to be seen whether these or any other influences yet to be discovered can account for the survival advantage observed in the Gerson system. How
ever, at present, we can cite no convincing evidence that patients treated in the Gerson system differed from the comparison groups according to any meaningful prognostic variables.

<P>This report has not accounted for variables such as the role and influence of individual components and various sets of components within the Gerson system. Subsequent to the completion of this report, we have shown two major variables, complementary u
se of surgery and the use of raw veal liver/carrot juice, to be

significantly associated with improved melanoma survival outcomes[17].  Studies of the rationales for modifications made by Gerson over the 30-year course of development of his treatment have led to contemporary modifications[17], creating still more chal
lenges for thorough analysis.

<P>This study is a retrospective analysis and therefore lacks the luster of a randomized clinical trial. However, the authors have made every attempt to verify adherence to therapy (especially by the survivors), to contrast these data with existing data b
anks, and to clearly present the comparisons here.

<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>DISCUSSION</B></FONT>

<P>No clearly defined mechanism has been identified to account for the survival advantage demonstrated above. Gerson believed that oxidizing enzymes supplied by the raw juices of his diet therapy improved host functions sufficiently to disadvantage malign
ant cells, which he believed produced their energy through fermentative metabolism. This belief was based on the long popular, but now disproven, cancer generalization of Otto Warburg discussed by Ling[32]. The clinical findings of the present study neith
er validate Gerson's Warburg-based rationale nor disprove Gerson's idea of host enhancement to challenge malignancy. 

<P>Gerson also believed, after Tannenbaum[33], that calorie restriction, increased calorie utilization rate, and micronutrient hyperalimentation could favor the tumor-bearing host and suppress development of both primary tumors and metastases. In principl
e, this belief may have withstood the test of time and advances in research[31].

<P>A huge general category of micronutrients, phytochemicals, has become the focus of a great deal of basic cancer and chemo-prevention research. Clearly, Gerson's treatment provides high, and in some cases extraordinary, doses of thousands of phytochemic
als. However, the literature does not yield practical knowledge of the effects of either individual or combined phytochemicals on human cancers.

<P>Cope[39] wrote that Gerson's salt-and-water management for cancer was an approach that probably led to correction of tissue damage syndrome, or cellular edema caused by poisoning, starvation, hypoxia, or physical trauma. He believed that Gerson's somet
imes extraordinary outcomes might have been due, at least in part, to this mechanism.

<P>Although it has been suggested[40] that any benefits conferred by Gerson's cancer therapy may result in greatest part from its psychosocial impact, this question has never been investigated.  It is reasonable that observers assume a mind/body effect, d
ue to the treatment's obvious self-help components and the CHIPSA medical team's active encouragement of family involvement, even during the patient's  hospitalization. Provisions have been made at CHIPSA for inexpensive room and board for companions. Spo
uses and close relatives are often able to stay with the patient in a private room. This accommodation results in a very high level of family and support-community involvement.

<P>Fawzy et al[28] recently provided findings demonstrating the positive impact of psychiatric intervention on the 6-year disease-free survival rate of stage I melanoma patients in his treatment system. In his study 13 of 34 stage I control subjects had m
elanoma recurrences (10 had died at the time of his report), whereas only 7 of 34 test patients had recurrences (3 had died).  Therefore, the 6-year disease-free survival rate for Fawzy's control subjects was 62%, whereas for his test patients it was 79%,
 a rate similar to the one cited by Balch[25]. Comparison with the 100% 6-year disease-free survival of 14 early stage (localized) melanoma patients in the Gerson treatment system shows a 27% greater survival benefit (0.21 difference in mean). However, du
e to the small sample size for Gerson patients, a log-rank test for continuity of survival curves (Figure 3) over the entire study time is below statistical significance, with only 93% confidence (P=.07). Still, especially w!

hen seen in the light of stage IIIA, IIIB and IVA  melanoma patients in the Gerson system, the complete absence of recurrence in the Gerson patients supports the possibility of a potent physiological effect from Gerson's therapy, in addition to its probab
le beneficial psychosocial effect.

<P>During peer review of this paper, a question arose regarding the potential difference between patients we were able to locate and assess versus those who remained lost to follow-up. How might lost-to-follow-up patients have affected the rates?

<P>To address this issue, we compared the current findings with those tabulated[34] in September 1993, at the beginning of our retrospective study. After updating its staging system to match the current report, we found that the 1993 analysis included 44 
patients in stages I-IVA assessable for 5-year survival. The 5-year rates were as follows: Stages I and II = 100% (n=12); Stages IIIA and IIIB = 68% (n=25); Stage IVA = 57% (n=7). The average 5-year survival rate for the entire group was 75%.

<P>Fourteen patients who had been lost to follow-up in 1993 were located and assessed during the last 2 years. Adding those 14 cases, bringing the number of assessable patients to 58, the rates remained substantially the same (with the exception of IVA, i
n which the initial sample size was quite small). The 5-year survival rates including those 14 cases are: Stages I and II = 100% (n=14); Stages IIIA and IIIB = 67% (n=30); Stage IVA = 36% (n=14).  The average 5-year survival rate of the enlarged group was
 67%.

<P>An additional 9 patients who were admitted after August 1988 but before August 1990 became assessable for 5-year survival. With inclusion of those cases, bringing the number of patients to 67, the

rates remained similar: Stages I and II = 100% (n=14); Stages IIIA and IIIB = 71% (n=35); Stage IVA = 39% (n=18). With recently recruited patients, the group's average 5-year survival rate was 69%.

<P>There were no statistically significant differences among the average rates (chi-squared=0.786, power=.109). We believe that the continuity of findings at various stages of the investigation suggests that the current rates are probably reliable, and th
at discovery or recruitment of additional patients, barring the recruitment of substantially greater numbers of stage I and II patients, will probably not alter the average survival rate significantly.  

<P>We were unable to assess a potential survival benefit for stage IVB melanoma patients in this treatment system. While the Gerson treatment provides many clinical benefits to stage IVB melanoma patients with internal metastases who are able to practice 
it, these benefits must be measured with validated "quality-of-life" instruments. Such measurements can be accomplished only through prospective data collection, which is ongoing and will be the subject of future reports. Data on exact date and cause of d
eath are being

pursued by application to the National Center for Health Statistics for use of the National Death Index. We will report findings as they become available.

<P>Clearly, the search for meaningful biological response modifiers, vaccines, and other means of host stimulation may be paramount for the management of advanced melanoma tumors that are internally

metastasized. In fact, any means of relatively safe tumor debulking must be given serious consideration.

<P>This retrospective study is our first (but not our last) effort at assessment of the outcomes of cancer patients moving through the Gerson treatment system.

The longest-surviving melanoma patient in this study has been disease-free for 20 years. Four patients who were alive and disease-free at 5 years (reported alive in this assessment) have died. Three stage III patients died of recurrent melanoma after the 
fifth year (one of them after 16 years). One stage IB patient died after 15 years, of prostate cancer, at age 74. And 41 patients are alive and free from disease.

<P>Although retrospective reviews cannot account for many influences, they clearly can be used to describe aggregate outcomes that can stand on their own for purposes of comparison with other groups and treatment systems, and to further the discussion reg
arding appropriate methods of cancer management.  We encourage those involved with other alternative and complementary methods of cancer management to pursue this route.

<br>
<blockquote>The Gerson Therapy is an intensive, nutrition-based and detoxifying medical
treatment for cancer, heart disease, diabetes and other chronic, degenerative diseases.  It works
closely with nature to help the sick body to rid itself of disease through the supportive effects of
simple foods, juices, and non-toxic medication.  Its successes in curing the dread diseases of our
times for the past 75 years have no parallel in the conventional medical context.<p>
The Gerson Institute is a non-profit organization dedicated to the holistic treatment of degenerative diseases. We strive to educate the public on the benefits of holistic healing through worldwide lectures and seminars, publication and distribution of literature on the Gerson Therapy, Training programs for Physicians, Healthcare practitioners, and home care assistants, and through establishing ties to approved clinics and treatment centers.

<H1>From the Convention Circuit ... We find another of Dr.
Gerson's patients</H1>
<H4>by Charlotte Gerson</H4>
<P>At the end of September, 1996, I had the great pleasure
of visiting the New York Chiropractic College. I was invited
to address the faculty and students, discussing the Gerson
Therapy. The following day, I did the usual lecture and
workshop for the public.I received a warm reception, and
thank the students and faculty for their help. I was deeply
impressed by the magnificent campus, set among rolling green
hills, studded with beautiful, majestic trees. The light,
airy buildings are situated along one of New York's extensive
finger lakes. There is a feeling of peace and beauty, very
conducive to study and meditation.</P>
<P>I received great joy from the testimonial of one of the
members of the audience. This gentleman introduced himself as
the nephew of one of the 50 cases (Case #18) Dr. Gerson
described in <A href="booklist.html#acancertherapy">
<I>A Cancer Therapy</I></A>. William Schickel. at age 32 was a
struggling artist with a young family, three small children,
the youngest a baby, and a 22 year old wife. He had been
diagnosed with inoperable, widespread retroperitoneal
lymphoma. Radiation was not an option, and he was literally
sent home with perhaps two months to live. Bill's wife, Mary,
found an article in a magazine on organic gardening in which
she read that Dr. Gerson was curing cancer by diet. Following
a pilgrimage to the shrine of the Blessed Philippine
Duschene, their decision was made: they would go to see Dr.
Gerson in New York City. </P>
<P>They arrived in the spring of 1950 from their home in
Loveland, Ohio. After numerous tests, Dr. Gerson felt that
Bill had perhaps a 30% chance of recovery on the nutritional
therapy. Bill was surprised that, in spite of the quiet
elegance of a Park Avenue office, Dr. Gerson's fees were
&quot;very modest&quot;. Gerson also told Bill that he would
not cure him but that his reactivated defenses, his body
would work to heal him.</P>
<P>Struggling physically and financially to follow this
demanding treatment, but with nothing to lose, Bill reports
that he felt better within a few weeks. He received no other
treatment.Bill writes that in 1983 he looked back on &quot;33
years, eight children, twelve grandchildren, and a wonderful
productive life&quot;. In September, 1996 (46 years after his
prognosis of 'two months'), Bill and his wife Mary beam from
the cover of <I>St. Anthony's Messenger</I>, inside of which
is the inspiring story of Bills activities. He is a famous
artist, designs and builds churches, church art and stained
glass windows, assisted by his sons and daughter Martha in
his art studio. Bill won national honors for his interior
design and artwork for the new St. Mary's Church in St.
Clairsville, Ohio. Some years ago, he also had an art show in
San Diego which I was proud to visit. Now 77, Bill works full
time with his family in his studio. When I spoke to him to
ask permission to publish this story, I could hear the energy
and enthusiasm in his strong voice. His story is copyrighted
and he expects to publish it sometime in the future. </P>
<P>We are grateful to Dr. Gerson for having given this
creative, prolific and talented artist the chance to live a
long, healthy and productive life, and make his quite
significant contribution to the world. </P>

Soy Products Dangerous?</TITLE></HEAD>
<H1>Are Soy Products Dangerous?</H1>
<P><B>by Charlotte Gerson</B>, with portions reprinted by
permission of <I>Newlife Magazine</I></P>
<P>A considerable percentage of the world's population is
undernourished or outright starving. For many years,
proteins, preferably from animal sources, have been
considered to be the best and most acceptable source of
nutrients. However, we also know that it takes some 16 pounds
of grains, fed to cows, to produce one pound of meat. In his
book <I>Diet for a New America</I>, author John Robbins
points out that we could easily feed the whole world if
everyone were to become vegetarian. This is an unlikely
scenario in the affluent Western world. So, in order to try
to feed the hungry, we are always looking for new sources of
&quot;good&quot; protein. </P>
<P>Much attention has been focused on the soy bean, a widely
grown legume that fulfills both the requirement for a high
protein food and a widely publicized health advantage: it is
low in fat and devoid of cholesterol! This should make it an
ideal food, but is it safe?</P>
<P>An extensive discussion on the subject written by Sally
W. Fallon, M.A., and Mary G. Enig, Ph.D. appeared in the May
1966 edition of <I>Newlife </I>magazine. Since we have often
been asked by a number of our <I>Gerson Healing
Newsletter</I> readers why Dr. Gerson prohibited soy
products, we should like to report on this thoroughly
researched material.</P>
<P>The authors trace the origin of the soy bean to the
Orient, where it was apparently used during the Chou Dynasty
(1134-246 BCE) as a crop rotation material, for its capacity
of fixing nitrogen in the soil. Soy products did not serve as
food until fermentation techniques were developed. When a
method was developed to make soy into a curd by precipitating
it with calcium sulfate or magnesium sulfate, the use of soy
products started to spread. Fermented soy products, such as
miso and tamari sauce, are apparently less harmful than the
precipitated ones, such as tofu or bean curd. But tofu
accounts for about 90% of the processed soybeans in Asia
today, say the authors. It seems that bean curds as a source
of protein did not come into use until about 700 A.D.</P>
<P>Fallon and Enig state that the &quot;Chinese did not eat
the soybean as they did other legumes, such as lentils,
because the soybean contains large quantities of a number of
harmful substances.&quot; Did the Chinese know this? Perhaps
they did, possibly they observed that disease symptoms
appeared after eating tofu or other cooked soy products.
Among the harmful substances, the authors name &quot;potent
enzyme inhibitors, which block the action of trypsin and
other enzymes needed for protein digestion.&quot; Apparently,
cooking does not deactivate these enzyme inhibitors, and they
can produce serious digestive problems such as reduced
protein digestion, chronic deficiencies in amino acid uptake,
enlargement of the pancreas (in animals) and cancer. </P>
<P>Soy products also contain another chemical, hemaglutinin
which promotes clumping of red blood cells. These clumped red
cells are unable to fully take up oxygen and carry it in the
blood stream to all tissues. Hemaglutinin has also been
observed to act as a growth depressant. Fermentation
deactivates these enzyme inhibitors, or at least reduces the
amounts present.</P>
<P>Soybeans are also high in phytic acids which is present
in the bran of hulls of all seeds. This material blocks the
uptake of essential minerals in the intestinal tract,
including such important ones as calcium, magnesium, iron and
especially zinc. Again, only the process of fermentation will
significantly reduce the phytate content of soy products.
Soybeans have a higher content of phytates than any other
legumes, making them of questionable safety and nutritional
value.</P>
<P>Bearing the above in mind, the authors feel that soy
products consumed with meat have a reduced mineral blocking
effect; however they warn particularly that vegetarians who
eat tofu with the idea that it may act as a protein
substitute, risk severe mineral deficiencies. They also feel
that most people appreciate the problems of calcium,
magnesium and iron deficiencies, but that zinc deficiency
produces some especially serious problems: zinc is needed for
optimal development and function of the brain and nervous
system, aside from its role in the immune system.</P>
<P><B>The profit motive</B>. </P>
<P>The average American has not adopted soy products (tofu,
tempeh, miso) as a principal food. Soy sauce may be the
exception to this rule, even though soy oil is also quite
widely used. About 140 billion pounds of soy beans per year
are grown in the US since the end of W.W.II, and the industry
is looking for new markets. At this time, the major use for
the bean is animal feed, and soy oil is used for hydrogenated
fats, margarine and shortening. New soy products are being
marketed to the growing &quot;health product&quot; consumers:
soy milk, soy baby formula, soy yogurt, soy ice cream, soy
cheese, soy flour for baking, and soy protein as a meat
substitute for the vegetarians. </P>
<P>During the production of soy milk, in order to remove as
much of the trypsin inhibitor as possible, the pur&eacute;ed
beans are soaked in an alkaline solution, then heated to
about 115&#186; C. in a pressure cooker. Unfortunately, even
though most (but not all) of the antinutrients are destroyed,
this processing also denatures the proteins, so the remaining
soy protein is very difficult to digest. The phytate content
remains in soy milk to block the uptake of essential
minerals. Worse, the alkaline soaking solution produces a
carcinogen, lysinealine, and reduces the cystine (an amino
acid) content in the soybean. Without cystine, the protein
complex is virtually useless unless the diet is fortified
with meat, eggs or dairy products, an unlikely situation for
vegetarians. </P>
<P>These problems arising from soy production are not
mentioned on labels, and the public is not aware of
them.&quot;Soy based infant formulas, along with trypsin
inhibitors, contain a high phytate level. Use of soy formula
has caused zinc deficiency in infants. Aluminum content of
soy formula is ten times greater than milk-based formula and
100 times greater than unprocessed milk.&quot; While soy milk
is tried on infants with milk allergies, allergy to soy
products is almost as common. The lack of cholesterol in soy
infant formula could inhibit brain development since
cholesterol is essential for the brain and nervous system.
Chemical additives to soy based foods further add to the
problems. </P>
<P>Soy products are widely distributed in third world
countries, presumably to overcome a protein deficiency in the
diets of starving people. They are also used extensively in
school lunch programs, commercial baked goods, diet beverages
and fast food products. New publicity promotes soy products
for their &quot;cancer preventing properties&quot;. While
traditionally fermented soy products may contain a cancer
preventing chemical, these are contained in an altered state
in non-fermented soy products and have no anti-carcinogenic
effect. On the contrary, it has been suggested that the rapid
increase of liver and pancreatic cancer in Africa is due to
the increased use of soy products.&quot;...to remove oil from
the soy bean, particularly high pressures and temperatures
are required, since this is an unusually difficult process.
Furthermore, hexane or other solvents are always used to
extract oil from soy beans, and traces remain in the
commercial product. But the high temperatures destroy some of
the possible beneficial fatty acid fractions of the soy oil:
the Omega-3's, which are especially susceptible to rancidity
when subjected to high pressures and temperatures.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;Claims that the fermented soy products can be
relied on as a source of B12 have not been supported by
scientific research.&quot; Nor do they supply the essential
fat soluble vitamins D and A, needed for the absorption of
all minerals. Unfortunately, soy products increase the
requirements for vitamin B12 and D.</P>
<P>The authors summarize all the above, and possible
arguments that soy products have been used for many centuries
in the Orient, as follows: &quot;traditional fermented soy
products have a long history of use that is generally
beneficial when combined with other elements of the Oriental
diet including rice, sea foods, fish broth and fermented
vegetables. Precipitated (Western) soy products can cause
serious problems, especially when they form the major source
of protein in the diet.&quot; </P>

Approaching Era of BSE ... Revenge of the Cannibal
Cows</TITLE></HEAD>
<H1>The Approaching Era of BSE ... Revenge of the Cannibal
Cows</H1>
<P>by Howard Straus, Editor</P>
<HR><P>There have been many cries of apocalyptic doom over
the last decade, from the hole in the ozone to the global
spread of AIDS, the rising cancer rate or global warming.
Many of these have generated controversies, each side of the
controversy having either a palpable agenda, or a vested
economic interest in the status quo. Meanwhile, governments,
in league with agribusiness have been fashioning a real,
present and current disease through cynicism, incompetence,
lies and shortsighted economic expedience. The result could
soon spell an epidemic that would dwarf cancer, heart disease
and AIDS.</P>
<P>In 1981, the British government relaxed agricultural
regulations regarding what could be fed to livestock,
allowing processed slaughterhouse waste to be fed to
livestock as high protein supplements. That meant that
various parts of sheep, chicken and cows, including brains,
eyes and bones, could be processed, flavored and mixed with
other feeds to cheaply increase the productivity of cattle
farms. Brains of sheep with a disease called scrapie were
included in the list of permitted contents of cattle feed, as
were, incredibly, chicken droppings. The fact that this
practice would turn normally vegetarian animals into
carnivores, even cannibals, was simply ignored, despite
warnings from various concerned scientists, and a Royal
Commission, who were roundly ignored and effectively
pooh-poohed. </P>
<P>The practice was widely adopted in the British cattle
industry, and subsequently led to cheaper beef, a highly
desirable result for the growers, and one that enabled the
British to compete well with the Continental beef producers
in France and Holland. </P>
<P>Suddenly, in 1986, the honeymoon ended. The first case of
a new cattle disease had been diagnosed. It was a bovine form
of the sheep disease scrapie, and was called bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE for short. Its better-known
name, by now, is Mad Cow Disease, because the cows that
contract the disease become aggressive, disoriented, and
generally appear to have gone &quot;mad&quot;. The disease
destroys and kills by literally turning the animals' brains
into sponges by boring holes in brain and nerve tissue.
Though the new disease was reported to the appropriate
authorities in the British government, they did nothing to
alert the general population to the situation for at least
eleven months, when they finally published the finding in an
obscure veterinary journal, unlikely to be seen or noticed by
the general public. Certainly, nothing was done to change the
practice of feeding slaughterhouse offal to cows, sheep,
chickens or pigs.</P>
<P>When the press got a hold of the story, and began raising
questions about the safety of British beef, the organs of
government churned into high gear. Every possible senior
official who had anything to do with public opinion, from the
Prime Minister to the Minister of Food and Farming, assuring
the world that British beef was sound, safe, and that this
disease, which had already made the jump from sheep to
cattle, could not possibly make the jump from cattle to
humans. This despite the fact that virtually nothing was
known for certain about BSE. Any researcher or government
official who did not hue to the party line was rapidly and
effectively silenced and/or &quot;made redundant&quot;, i.
e.: fired.</P>
<P>In 1989, two cases of an atypical strain of
Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (CJD) were diagnosed, a strain
which was alarmingly similar in effect and area of the brain
attacked to BSE. Rare instances of this disease had been
recorded as far back as 1965. Britain's trading partners
began making noises about quarantining British beef, as the
European Economic Community (EEC) had already done to
American beef (antibiotic residues are so high that American
beef is considered &quot;tainted&quot; by the EEC). Still
knowing nothing about the cause of the disease, and having no
&quot;scientific&quot; proof one way or another, the British
government continued its public relations campaign to
convince the world that British beef was sound. How could
they guarantee the health of every cow in the British Isles?
Advertising and governmental gobbledegook would have to do
the trick. The idea that someone might actually have to be
held accountable for an incipient and deadly epidemic was
simply unthinkable. Still, nothing was done to halt the
practice of feeding cows to cows.</P>
<P>The epidemic started to grow. At first, only older people
were affected. Many cases of CJD were probably misdiagnosed,
since the symptoms in humans are very similar to those of
Alzheimer's' Disease. In fact, at least one victim's wife,
convinced that her husband had died of CJD rather than the
diagnosed Alzheimer's, repeatedly demanded an autopsy before
her husband's body was cremated. She was unable to prevent
the cremation, and the autopsy was never done. Another
victim's mother, going public to save other mothers the agony
of watching their own teenagers sicken and die, was told to
think of the economic havoc she was causing. It appeared that
CJD had an incubation period of between ten and twenty years,
and nobody could prove that it was transmitted via cows and
the consumption of animal flesh. Experiments done by the
British government themselves showed that, contrary to the
authorities' statements, monkeys, and by extension, probably
humans were capable of contracting the disease from cattle.
Yet, the spin doctors managed to turn even these experiments
into encouraging news! Not until 1988 were any limits put
onto the amounts, types and health of the offal going into
cattle feed, and then they were inadequate and sloppily
enforced by a government far more responsive (as usual) to
the short-term economic interests of the farmers and commerce
than to the health and survival of its individual citizens.
It was a further two years before controls were put on
feeding infected offal to poultry, whose droppings, remember,
were still being fed to the cattle. Only on March 20, 1996,
after teenagers, some as young as 15 and 16 years old, began
to die of a much faster moving strain of the disease, one
with an incubation time of five to ten years, did the
government finally admit that BSE was the &quot;most
likely&quot; cause of the recent outbreak of CJD, publicly
eating their own words.</P>
<P>On March 26, 1996, the rest of Continental Europe, led by
Germany, put a quarantine on all British beef and beef
products. Russia even embargoed British milk and leather. The
British government has very belatedly instituted a program of
cattle destruction, hoping to limit the damage and restore
confidence in farming practices and the health of the British
cattle herd, numbering in the millions of animals. The
practice of feeding infected offal to the remaining animals
has been discontinued. But the death toll from the new strain
of CJD continues to rise, and the victims are otherwise
healthy teenagers and young adults.</P>
<P>The problems, of course, are very complex. In Iceland,
when the related sheep disease scrapie was found to be
infecting a large proportion of the sheep, every sheep in
Iceland was slaughtered and disposed of, and the entire herd
was replaced by importing healthy animals from abroad. Within
a few years, however, the new herd was infected again. The
only possible means of transmission of the disease from the
sheep that no longer existed to the new, healthy sheep, was
that the ground was infected, and the new sheep could be
infected from the urine and droppings of the old sheep. The
latest understanding of this disease is that it is not
transmitted by a virus or microbe, but by a tiny protein
fraction (called a prion) that is virtually indestructible by
sterilization, acids, heat or burial in soil. This has
chilling implications for the British, who, until recently,
have been burying large numbers of slaughtered, infected cows
and sheep in farms and landfills, many near rivers and
municipal water sources. There is no way to remove these
sources of infection from the ground, as the products of
decay have, by now, spread far and wide, both from urine and
cattle droppings, and from the buried animals. The disease
causes no immune response, and there is no known treatment
for it, much less cure.</P>
<P>Often, when a farmer begins to see the first symptoms of
a BSE-infected animal, economics dictate that he is better
off to kill and bury the animal on his farm than to admit
that his farm is no longer BSE-free, or even better, send the
animal to the slaughterhouse before the animal becomes
clinically ill and has to be destroyed. Although the
government will pay him to destroy and incinerate the
carcass, animals from &quot;BSE-free&quot; farms fetch higher
prices than those from farms admitting the problem.
Unfortunately, this gives farmers large economic incentive to
misrepresent the status of their farms. Some farmers have
already been fined for falsely representing their farms as
BSE-free, others have, most likely, escaped detection.</P>
<P>By May, 1990, a quarter of the population of Great
Britain refused to eat beef. In six months, beef prices
dropped 10-25%, devastating the cattle industry. Cats and zoo
animals are now dying regularly from their own variants of
spongiform encephalopathy; over 160,000 British cattle have
already succumbed to it. To date, there is still no
well-defined, strictly implemented program for keeping
infected offal from infecting healthy meat in Great
Britain.</P>
<P>That's England, though, isn't it?</P>
<P>&quot;What does this have to do with the United
States?&quot; you may be asking. &quot;We have been assured
that there is no BSE problem here. We don't import British
beef, do we?&quot; Well, no, we don't, and haven't since
1989. But what we do continue here is the practice, now
banned in Great Britain, of feeding processed slaughterhouse
waste to cows, chickens and pigs as low cost, high-protein
feed supplementation. This is the very practice that got the
British cattle industry in such bad trouble so very quickly a
decade and a half ago: feeding cows to cows. In 1991, the
USDA considered a mandatory ban on the practice. But
according to an internal USDA document, the agency dismissed
the ban because, &quot;the cost to the livestock and
rendering industries would be substantial.&quot; (Sound like
Britain's initial response?) </P>
<P>We certainly have the problem of scrapie in America, and
it is known to have jumped the species barrier from sheep to
the cattle herd. Scrapie manifests itself in cattle as the
animal falling down, and being unable to rise again. There is
the possibility, even the likelihood of an outbreak of BSE
and its associated human form, CJD occurring in the United
States. It may already have arrived here, and been missed in
the background noise of the enormous human tragedy of our
epidemic of Alzheimer's disease. It is quite possible that
many cases of CJD have been misdiagnosed here as Alzheimer's,
disguising the onset of the epidemic by not recognizing it
for what it is, and giving us a false sense of security. In
fact, there is good evidence that BSE has been in the United
States since the mid-'70s.</P>
<P>What is even worse is that it is not just beef that is
affected. By now, slaughterhouse workers, farmers and food
preparation workers have died of CJD, possibly from the
constant contact with animal blood and offal. The ground on
which the cattle have been urinating and defecating is
certainly infected, and we know that the vector survives in
the ground for long periods of time. We know little about the
effects of the disease or its vectors on other animals fed
infected offal, such as chickens and pigs. And we must assume
that milk and other animal products, like gelatin and dairy
products, and anything that contains them, are possibly
infectious. Think about that, for a moment. Substitute the
more familiar but less likely disease &quot;AIDS&quot;, and
imagine being at risk for infection from a milk chocolate bar
or a cold remedy in a gelatin capsule, the egg, butter or
milk in a piece of birthday cake, a cup of nonfat yogurt or
cottage cheese, and you will begin to understand how deeply
the malpractice of the food-animal industry has endangered
your life and the lives of your family. </P>
<P>&quot;The critical uncertainty,&quot; to quote an article
from the Internet by Michael Greger, &quot;is, how small a
dose is necessary to pass the disease along? Theoretically,
it doesn't matter if BSE can infect humans if we never eat
enough meat within a lifetime. Last year, calculations were
made to determine how many people will have consumed a
potentially infectious dose by 1997. The conservative
estimate runs upwards of 34 million people. In other words,
virtually a whole generation of people may die. And we are
not talking about a quick and simple death, either. If we
assume the disease runs a course similar to CJD, these people
will wake up one morning twitching and deteriorate weekly
into blindness and epilepsy, while their brain perforates
into a sponge. If they're lucky, they will be dead within
three months; if not, it may take up to five years.&quot;</P>
<P>This disease has the potential to be far more widespread
and deadly than AIDS or cancer, than heart disease or stroke.
And we don't know we have it until it is far, far too late to
do anything about, not to mention the fact that there is, at
the moment, nothing we can do about it. Americans' trust in
our own government has already fallen to such a low level
that we rarely believe its self-serving, exculpatory
statements. We must now, however, find a way to let the
government know, in no uncertain terms, that we are outraged
at the suicidal behavior of the factory farming industry and
of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, which is charged with
the often contradictory tasks of regulating and promoting
American agriculture. </P>
<P>Though we, as Gerson Persons, are basically vegetarians,
the practice of making vegetarian animals into cannibals puts
us all at risk from the most apparently innocuous substances,
and from contaminated water that cannot be purified short of
expensive steam distillation. We must force our governmental
organs to be responsive to our health and safety, and soon,
if we are not to fall victims en masse to the same fate as so
many Britons have already. We must fight for our survival
against our own food suppliers, and against our own
government, against the very institutions we want to believe
are protecting us. We know the results of trusting the FDA
and the NCI to help us. </P>
<P>This one, however, is a battle we cannot afford to lose.

<H2>Cure of Small Cell Lung Cancer</H2>
<B>Patient Story: William Hetzler</B>
<A HREF ="chemo101.htm"></A>
<P>by Charlotte Gerson
<p><IMG SRC="banner2.gif" alt="*">
<P>We rarely see patients with "small cell" (or oat cell) type of lung
cancer.  <I>Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment</I>, Krupp and Chatton,
1993 says that lung cancer patients, in general, have an 8% chance of
surviving 5 years.  However, the small cell anaplastic (oat cell)
types have the worst prognosis.  "It metastasizes early and widely,
and is not amenable to surgery."  In his monograph Chemotherapy of
Advanced Epithelial Cancer, physician and biostatistician Dr. Ulrich
Abel wrote that "small cell lung cancer is the only carcinoma for
which good direct evidence of a survival improvement by chemotherapy
exists."  But this improvement amounts to a matter of three months!

<P>In late February of 1993, William Hetzler, then 55 years old, arrived
at the <a href="center.html"> hospital</a>.  He had been diagnosed and biopsied at the
Long Beach Hospital on Long Island, (New York).  He subsequently
consulted a pulmonary specialist at the North Shore Hospital, also on
Long Island, for a second opinion .  He was advised to transfer
immediately to the oncology department for chemotherapy.  He was told
that without chemotherapy, he might have 3-4 months survival.  

<P>A cousin of his in Oregon where he runs an organic farm told him to
call the Gerson Institute for information on nutritional healing.
Given some hope, he came to Mexico.  He now admits that he was deeply
depressed and had periods of crying while at the <a href="center.html"> hospital</a>.
However, by the time he left, he had become hopeful.  

<P>In August of 1993, while we were at a Convention in New York, William
attended, mostly in order to testify about his experience.  At that
time, only about 6 months after he arrived at the <a href="center.html">hospital</a> in "terminal"
condition, he reported that his latest chest X-ray showed his lungs
to be clear of cancer.  He carried on with the strict Gerson Therapy
for two years.  It is now over two years and he is well, planning a
business trip to Europe.  He says that he now "sleeps to heal," and
remains on the modified Gerson Therapy.  He told me that he took
shark cartilage all through his therapy.  He doesn't want to go back
to his original oncologist.  "All the sick people there depress me,"
he said.

<H4>From Charlotte Gerson's Clinical Notebook, Healing
Newsletter Vol. 10, No. 4</H4>
<H1>Answers to Some Frequently Asked Questions</H1>
<P>by Charlotte Gerson</P>
<HR><P>In his last book, <A
href="booklist.html#acancertherapy">
 A Cancer Therapy: Results of 50 Cases</A>, Dr. Max Gerson
incorporated the experiences, trials and errors of a
lifetime. He especially needed to record the details of his
work with advanced and terminal cancer patients. For these
patients he had to fine-tune his therapy to the ultimate
degree, to obtain the best foods and juice extraction, the
most carefully adjusted medications, and the most thorough
detoxification. He did this with very specific directions:
how to do the enemas, how best to extract the juices, and so
forth. Over the years, various authors have proposed their
own ideas in the above areas, often differing from Dr.
Gerson's. This has naturally raised questions for patients
using the Therapy, as well as others interested in the theory
and practice of the Gerson Therapy. I would like to explain
some of the reasons underlying Dr. Gerson's detailed
instructions in these areas. </P>
<P><A href="ref.html#juicer">
Juicers </A> </P>
<P>The juicing is so tedious, with all the grinding and
pressing. Isn't there an easier and faster way, or a cheaper
juicer that I could use? </P>
<P>Dr. Gerson said in his address to a group assembled in
Escondido, California in 1956 (Appendix II, p. 406, <A
href="booklist.html#acancertherapy">
A Cancer Therapy</A>): &quot;At first I thought that
liquefiers would be the most wonderful thing. All the
material was there, nothing was lost. But it didn't
work.&quot; The rotating blade gives rise to a &quot;dynamo
effect&quot;, causing electricity to be generated, and
killing enzymes. The same is true for centrifugal juicers.
Juices must be made by grinding the vegetables first, mixing
them, and then pressing them in a press. We have recently
come across cancer patients who tried to heal themselves on
the Gerson Therapy using a centrifugal juicer. They
experienced no improvement. When they tried the Therapy with
Champion juicers, they did well. The more seriously ill
patients still need the grinding plus pressing type of juicer
arrangement to properly heal. </P>
<P>In response to a question from a patient about the two
step juicing process, Dr. Gerson wrote that &quot;the malic
acid (contained in the apples) mixed with the ground carrots
helps to release the minerals from the carrots.&quot; In
other words, it is necessary to first grind the apples and
carrots together into a bowl, using a grinder. The Norwalk,
K&amp;K or Champion juicers can be used as grinders, but the
Champion cannot be used as a press. The ground materials are
mixed in the bowl, the mixture is placed in a press cloth and
put under pressure in the Norwalk or K&amp;K press. This
process produces the best extraction, richest in minerals,
and the tastiest juice. Juice produced by the Champion juicer
alone separates into a transparent liquid at the bottom and
mush on top after a very short time. This juice is harder for
the patient to drink because of the particles, and is not as
rich and homogeneous in nutrients. </P>
<P>Recently the Green Power juicer was introduced. It does a
better job of extraction than the Champion alone used as a
juicer. But it offers no way (as the Champion does) to block
the juicing action. It is impossible to use the Green Power
juicer as a grinder only, it grinds and juices in one
operation. While it extracts juice quite efficiently, it does
not fulfill Dr. Gerson's requirement of mixing the ground
apples and carrots thoroughly before pressing. </P>
<P><A href="ref.html#coffee">
Enemas </A> </P>
<P>I thought that high colonics cleaned out the entire
colon. Why shouldn't one do high colonics? Aren't we trying
to clear out the colon? </P>
<P>Anyone who is at all familiar with the Gerson Therapy is
well aware of the utmost importance of the coffee enemas.
(Gerson Healing Newsletter #13, May, 1986). But questions
arise from Dr. Gerson's instructions, specifically his
warning: NO HIGH COLONICS. High colonics don't accomplish
what coffee enemas do, namely, open the liver/bile ducts to
allow the liver to release toxins. They also interfere with
basic colonic functions: reabsorption of nutrients, vitamins
and fluids, especially when used regularly. </P>
<P>Let us first examine the basics. Dr. Gerson found that
the underlying problems of all cancer patients are toxicity
and deficiency. He had to overcome both these difficulties.
He found that one of the important features of his therapy
had to be the hourly administration of fresh vegetable
juices. These supply ample nutrients, as well as fluids to
help flush out the kidneys. When the high levels of nutrients
re-enter tissues, toxins accumulated over many years are
forced into the blood stream. The toxins are then filtered
out by the liver. The liver is easily overburdened by the
continuous release of toxins and is unable to release the
load. This can cause liver damage, even liver coma -- unless
the liver is helped to release the overload. Dr. Gerson found
that he could provide help to the liver by the caffeine in
coffee, absorbed from the colon via the hemorrhoidal vein,
which carries the caffeine to the portal system and then to
the liver. The caffeine stimulates the liver/bile ducts to
open, releasing the poisons into the intestinal tract for
excretion. </P>
<P>High colonics are usually not done with coffee, and
therefore do not benefit the liver. Even if coffee were to be
used, a high colonic forces it high into the transverse and
ascending colon, where it is not absorbed into the portal
system. </P>
<P>With the constant administration of vegetable juices of
the Gerson Therapy, a flood of toxins is steadily released
from the poisoned cells in the body. Four to five coffee
enemas daily are needed to help continuously unburden the
liver, and deal with the toxins. It would be impossible, even
dangerous, to do five high colonics daily. </P>
<P>Colonics have another undesirable effect. The colon is a
very important recycling organ which reabsorbs fluids,
enzymes and minerals. It also produces some vitamins with the
help of friendly bacteria. Regular high colonics disturb this
activity, flushing out essential minerals, enzymes and
friendly bacteria along with the waste materials. This could
lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance (washing out
too many of the minerals the body needs). </P>
<P>If a patient wishes to use one or two high colonics prior
to starting the Gerson Therapy, we have no objection. But the
often-suggested course of 15 or 30 colonics should not be
undertaken. In addition, it is possible to stretch the colon
and lose some of its normal muscle function. </P>
<P>Most doctors and nurses are taught to have the patient
lie on the left side to take their enemas. Dr. Gerson wanted
the patient to lie on his right side. With the patient in
this position, gravity will help the coffee flow past the
descending colon, just around the &quot;corner&quot; of the
splenic flexure, and into the transverse colon for higher
penetration and better release of toxic feces. </P>
<P>One more important note: When using the castor oil enema,
it is necessary to add some soap to the coffee/castor oil
solution so the oil does not float to the top. Do not grate
soap into the solution. Too much soap will irritate and
inflame the colon. Just rub a cake of soap for a few moments
with your hand immersed in the (liquid) coffee. This will
release enough soap to do the job. </P>
<P><A href="ref.html#flaxoil">
Flax Seed Oil </A> </P>
<P>Dr. Gerson strongly prohibited any fats or oils, yet <A
href="booklist.html#acancertherapy">
A Cancer Therapy</A> says to use flax seed oil. What is the
source of this contradiction? </P>
<P>Dr. Gerson was very much aware that patients require the
intake of essential fatty acids. He experimented with various
substances, including sunflower, safflower, olive and other
oils to try to satisfy this need. He even tried fresh,
unsalted butter. In all cases, fats administered to patients,
even after they were already free of tumor tissue, caused the
regrowth of cancers. Therefore, Dr. Gerson stated repeatedly
and emphatically when describing the practice of the Therapy
&quot;NO OILS, NO FATS.&quot; </P>
<P>In 1958, after his book had been published, Gerson found
the work of Dr. Johanna Budwig. Dr. Budwig described her
successful use of flax seed oil (linseed oil) in cancer
patients. Dr. Gerson tried this substance and found it very
beneficial. It supplies the essential fatty acids, helps to
carry Vitamin A through the blood stream and supplies
linoleic and linolenic acids. </P>
<P>In a letter to his long-time friend, Dr. Albert
Schweitzer, Gerson described his protocol for the use of Flax
Seed Oil: two tablespoons a day for the first month on the
Gerson Therapy; one tablespoon thereafter. This prescription
seems to be in conflict with Dr. Gerson's injunction of NO
OILS, NO FATS. In the charts on pp. 235 and 236 of <A
href="booklist.html#acancertherapy">
A Cancer Therapy</A>, the reader will find that the use of
flax seed oil is described. The reason for the
&quot;contradiction&quot; is that, on the basis of Dr.
Gerson's research in the last year of his practice, we added
the flax seed oil prescription. We did not change the text in
the book prohibiting all fats and oils, because we wanted to
keep Dr. Gerson's original words as intact as possible. We
hope that this explains any apparent contradictions the
reader may find. </P>
<P>Flax seed oil is made from organic flax seed, cold
pressed, bottled in a light-tight container, and sealed in
the presence of inert gas, not air. This careful handling
keeps the oil from oxidizing, and becoming rancid. It must
never be heated, and should never be used to cook, bake or
fry anything. Unopened bottles may be stored in a freezer for
up to six months; in a refrigerator for up to three months.
Once opened and exposed to air, still refrigerated, the oil
is only usable for three weeks. </P>
<P>Patients should use the <A href="ref.html#flaxoil">
golden, filtered oil </A>, not the brownish and viscous
material that includes lignins. The lignins come from part of
the fiber of the seed, which also contains certain
undesirable proteins. These should be avoided. Also, when
used by patients, only the oil should be taken, not freshly
ground flax seeds, for the same reason. Some patients have
been told by well-meaning friends that lignins or flax powder
can be used and added to cakes. That is totally out of the
question. </P>
<P><B>&quot;Medical Hell&quot;</B> </P>
<P>At the end of May, 1995, a patient was admitted to the
therapy <A href="center.html">
hospital </A> suffering from pancreatic cancer. Patients are
requested to bring their medical records with them, and this
patient brought his doctor's consultation and operation
(biopsy) report along. This young man is only 38 years old,
and has a fairly healthy lifestyle. I do not understand why
he has such a serious problem at this early age. He gave me a
copy of his medical report and, I must admit, I read it in
amazement and disbelief. Since it is so incredible, I am
quoting two paragraphs here exactly as they appear on the
report. </P>
<P>&quot;I have explained to the patient the absence of
surgical resolution of the problem [inoperable] and he will
be seen by the Cancer Clinic and we'll discuss the role or
non-role of chemo and radiotherapy in this condition. The
gravity of his illness was explained to him. At the moment,
he's in a state of denial and shock, but certainly his father
[who is an MD] and wife are well aware of the seriousness of
the situation. </P>
<P>&quot;This man was informed of the diagnosis in the
absence of all involved regular physicians by one of the
family physicians covering for Dr. D. D. in Campbell River.
This at least prepared him for the descent into hell of
having the diagnosis of cancer of the pancreas that he is now
embarked upon ...&quot; </P>
<P>We have seen a number of patients showing total
recoveries from pancreatic cancer, even when it has spread to
the bile duct, spleen, or further. We are often accused of
quackery and &quot;giving desperately ill people false
hope.&quot; Even if our patients do not all recover, we do
give them hope, not false hope, rather than despair. Is the
above medical report an example of compassionate &quot;health
care&quot; providers? <IMG SRC="banner2.gif" alt="*">

<br>Are your teeth killing you?</b></font></center>



<p><center><font size=-1><b>by Charlotte Gerson</b></font></center>

<p><center><img src="banner1.gif" alt="*"></center>



<p>Many of our patients and readers are well-informed about the dangers

of "silver-amalgam" fillings.  These commonly-used fillings consist

of more than 51% mercury mixed with silver and some other metals.

The problem, of course, is mercury - a highly toxic heavy metal

with a powerful effect on the nervous system.  Once installed in

teeth, some of the mercury leaches out into the system and into

circulation.  Some people, admittedly, are a great deal more

sensitive to this circulating mercury than others.  Mercury has been

shown to even cause multiple sclerosis in some patients.  When the

"silver fillings" were removed, the patients recovered.  Other people

have silver fillings in their teeth for many years with no apparent

problems.



<p>What is less well-known is the condition that occurs when the root of

a tooth becomes abscessed.  In order to treat the infection, the

dentist first removes any loose or diseased material from the canal

that houses the nerve.  When the nerve is removed, the tooth dies.

Root Canal Cover-Up by Dr. George E. Meinig, D.D.S., F.A.C.D. in 1993

documents the extensive and detailed research done by Dr. Weston A.

Price, D.D.S., F.A.C.D., in the first few decades of this century.

Dr. Meinig founded, and for many years headed The Association of Root

Canal Specialists, a group of dentists engaged in performing root

canal procedures.  He admits to doing many hundreds himself.

However, when he discovered the research done by Dr.  Price detailing

the dangers inherent in this treatment, he resigned his position and

now spends his time and energies in making the public, as well as

professionals, aware of the research.



<p>Dr. Price's first indication of health problems due to root canals

came from a patient who was bedfast and virtually paralyzed by

rheumatoid arthritis.  For some reason, her root canal filled tooth

was removed, although it looked healthy and normal on X-rays. Within

a few weeks the patient was able to get up; after some months, she

was able to walk and her health was totally restored.  Intrigued, Dr.

Price took the extracted tooth, sterilized it thoroughly, and

implanted it under the skin of a rabbit.  Within five days, the

rabbit developed severe rheumatoid arthritis; in ten days it died of

the disease.



<p>Dr. Price subsequently repeated the experiment with many other

patients who had root canal filled teeth extracted, some suffering

from kidney disease, others from heart disease, and many more with

arthritis.  In virtually all cases, the patients showed considerable

improvement, and some even total recovery after the offending teeth

were removed.  Often, Dr. Price implanted the extracted and

sterilized teeth under the skin of rabbits.  In each case, a tooth

removed from the patient caused the patient's disease in the rabbit.

Dr. Price went even further to try to clear the apparently infectious

material from the extracted teeth: he autoclaved them (sterilized by

steam pressure, usually at 250 degrees F. or 121 degrees C.).

Sterilization made no difference: the rabbits with the sterilized

teeth implanted still developed the diseases and died, usually within

ten days.  As a control, Dr. Price implanted a healthy tooth under

the skin of a rabbit.  This rabbit lived without showing any signs of

disease for its normal life span of about 15 years.  



<p>The underlying problem is very interesting: when the nerve is removed

from a tooth, the tooth is dead, and is no longer supplied with

nutrients.  The normal structure of a tooth includes tiny "canules"

(similar to capillaries in all human tissue) that carry nutrients to

the living tooth.  The tooth's constant circulation is also

instrumental in clearing potentially infectious material from the

tooth.  Once the tooth is dead, however, nutrients stop circulating

through these canules, and the tooth loses its ability to clear

itself of infection.  Instead the canules become infested with germs

and viruses.  Additionally, the filling of the nerve canal shrinks a

little bit over time, allowing still more bacteria and viruses to

lodge in the gap between the filling and the tooth.  None of this is

visible on X-rays.  A dead tooth is thus a potent source of bacterial

and viral toxins and infections that can spread throughout the

system.  Inability of sterilization under extreme conditions to clear

the infectious material should prove that, no matter how good one's

dental hygiene is, it is simply impossible to remove the danger.  



<p>People with good immune systems and powerful defenses can often live

with this constant trouble source without developing symptoms.  Yet,

careful X-rays eventually show "cavitation" (hollowing out of the

surrounding jawbone) around the root canal treated teeth.  As the

hitherto resistant patient ages or is weakened by accidents, colds

and flus or severe stress, his ability to overcome this "focal

infection" is reduced.  The infection is then able to cause or

contribute to the development of severe chronic disease.



<p>In view of the above, it will not come as a surprise that we urgently

suggest that patients remove any teeth with root canal fillings.



<p>In the 1950's, German physician Dr. Josef Issels heard a lecture by

Dr. Gerson, and subsequently successfully used alternative treatments

in helping many cancer patients.  Dr. Issels himself spent some time

at the CHIPSA hospital, and, while there, pointed out the severe

damage caused by root canal fillings.  He said that he refused to

treat any cancer patient who did not allow all "devitalized" (dead)

teeth to be removed, as he found that he could not obtain good

results without this procedure.  



<p><center><b>Infected tonsils also cause problems</b></center>



<p>We had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Issels again recently, at a

convention in Orlando that we were both attending.  In the course of

our discussion, he returned to the question of "devitalized" teeth,

and described a simple, infrared machine that is capable of detecting

the infections.  He told us that the detector is also capable of

finding infected tonsils.  



<p>Dr. Issels estimated that approximately 90% of cancer patients have

undetected infections in their tonsils that cannot be found during

routine examinations.  He told us of the case of a patient whose

tonsils Issels insisted needed to be removed.  The surgeon was

doubtful about the necessity of the procedure, because he could not

find any reason for the tonsillectomy.  After the tonsil was out, the

surgeon wanted to prove to Issels that the removed tonsil was

perfectly sound, and cut into it.  He was shocked to have the pus

virtually squirt out into his face.



<p>Dr. Issels was making the following point: it is difficult to

determine that teeth and/or tonsils are infected and are

significantly contributing to the patient's illness.  Every effort

should be made to clear these foci of infection by removing root

canal filled teeth and damaged tonsils, to ensure the maximum chance

of recovery.



<p>Root Canal Cover-Up by Dr. George E. Meinig, D.D.S., F.A.C.D, $19.95,

plus $3.00 postage and handling, is available from the Gerson

Institute.  California residents, please add 7.5% sales tax.

<H2>The Cure and Prevention of Diabetes</H2>
<P><B>by Charlotte Gerson, President, The Gerson
Institute</B> </P>
<P><IMG SRC="banner1.gif" alt="*">
 </P>
<P>In order to simplify the discussion of diabetes, we will
divide the subject into two sections: Juvenile Diabetes and
Age Onset Diabetes. Due to its causes, age onset diabetes is
relatively simple and easy to overcome with the Gerson
Therapy. It has been shown that many patients with age onset
diabetes actually produce adequate amounts of insulin, as is
evidenced in their blood. Yet they are not able to properly
assimilate and burn sugar at the cellular level to produce
energy. Instead, diabetics often excrete sugar in the urine,
are thirsty and drink excessive amounts of water, and lack
energy. Since these patients have insulin in their blood, why
are they diabetic? The problem is that the available insulin
in the bloodstream is not being used by the body to
metabolize the sugar. In order to perform its function,
insulin must enter the individual cell and reach the cell's
insulin receptors. In diabetics, insulin receptors are
blocked or clogged with cholesterol, so the insulin is unable
to do its job. So age-onset diabetes is really a cholesterol
problem, not one of sugar, or even malfunction of the
pancreas (which produces insulin in the Islets of
Langerhans). </P>
<P>Since no animal products are used, the Gerson Therapy is
totally devoid of cholesterol. At the <A href="center.html">
hospital</A> facility where the Gerson Therapy is
administered, we have seen blood cholesterol levels drop
dramatically, in some patients, up to 100 points in just one
week on the therapy without cholesterol-reducing drugs. If
the uptake of insulin is blocked by cholesterol, then it
could be expected that this dramatic reduction in serum
cholesterol levels would result in an almost immediate
reduction of the requirement for insulin supplementation. In
fact, it does. One patient, who also suffered from
metastasized melanoma in the liver, had a fasting blood sugar
level of 177 on entering the <A href="center.html">
Gerson hospital</A> (the normal level is 120 or below). In
two days, this level dropped to 120 - without insulin. In one
particularly dramatic case, we saw a diabetic patient, age
46, with sugar levels in his bloodstream of over 200, that
were uncontrollable with insulin and drugs. This problem
completely cleared in five weeks. At that time, he was able
to take all the juices of the full Gerson Therapy (carrot
juices contain large amounts of complex carbohydrates)
without any further need of insulin. His blood sugar level
returned to a normal 120, and remained stable. </P>
<H2>Juvenile Diabetes</H2>
<P>Juvenile diabetes presents entirely different problems.
In juvenile diabetes, as opposed to age-onset diabetes, we
are dealing with true insulin deficiency, damage to the
Islets of Langerhans (the gland clusters in the pancreas that
produce insulin). According to an article some years ago, in
Scientific American, juvenile diabetes is most commonly
diagnosed in children after a severe, long lasting 'flu' that
doesn't seem to yield to normal treatment. This, it turns
out, was not a flu, but pancreatitis; an infection and
inflammation of the pancreas, resulting in damage to the
Islets of Langerhans, and the subsequent diabetes. A few days
ago, I had a call from a distraught parent who is trying to
deal with two children, girls aged 6 and 10, both afflicted
with juvenile diabetes. He did not comprehend the true cause
of his children's disease and the progression of their
problems, starting in early infancy, that led to diabetes. I
have talked to many parents and can usually reconstruct what
happened. The children are immune deficient from birth. This
deficiency is aggravated by immunizations, but it is also
due, in large part, to the mother's poor nutrition, one
lacking in essential nutrients. </P>
<P>These already deficient babies are generally not
breast-fed, but instead receive artificial canned, jarred,
and processed milk and baby foods. The resulting lack of
nutrients adds to the original immune deficiency, and
manifests as a progression of infections, colds and flu. The
child is now plied with drugs, including antibiotics and
various flu medicines. Drugs will temporarily suppress the
infections (in the above case, constant ear infections) but
will not strengthen the immune system. On the contrary, all
antibiotics are toxic to some extent and suppress the immune
system further. So the infections become more frequent and
more severe - until, one day, they become a full fledged
pancreatitis. Not long after that, the child is diagnosed
with juvenile diabetes. </P>
<P>We need to consider another point: the liver and the
pancreas, since they are such extremely important organs,
have their own immune systems, the reticulo-endothelial
system. If hepatitis or pancreatitis occurs, this alone
proves that the affected organ's immune system is severely
damaged. The weakening of the immune system is caused
partially by frequent doses of antibiotics and/or other
medical drugs - all of which are more or less liver toxic.
But once a child develops diabetes and begins taking insulin,
this does not overcome the immune weakness. On the contrary,
the infections continue and require more and more drug
suppression. Insulin does not produce healing! </P>
<P>For many people who have never dealt with the problem,
diabetes seems like a mild illness, easily overcome with
insulin injections. That is unfortunately not true. Juvenile
diabetes often results in kidney damage, with resulting need
for kidney dialysis. Many of the children afflicted with this
disease, as they go into early adulthood, are subject to
retinal damage which can result in blindness. Young adults
whose kidneys no longer function require kidney dialysis and
eventually kidney transplants - which are only good for a few
years and then fail with deplorable results. </P>
<P>In age-onset diabetics, the doctor's suggestion to avoid
starches and sugars and eat more proteins produces other
serious problems. As we have seen above, this disease is
largely due to excess cholesterol. But the recommendation of
&quot;a high protein diet&quot; is understood by most
patients to mean that they should eat largely animal
products. Meat, chicken, fish, cheese, eggs and milk are very
high in cholesterol, the very cause of the problem. The
result for most of these patients is that more serious
cholesterol problems develop: deposits in the arteries
leading to high blood pressure, heart disease and heart
attacks; poor circulation with resulting gangrene. Gangrenous
toes, feet and legs often must be amputated. Retinal
detachment problems lead to blindness. </P>
<P>Most of the problem is the excess cholesterol as well as
excess animal protein that causes much of the overload on the
kidneys and their eventual failure. Few people realize that
diabetes is the third most frequent cause of death in the
United States (after cardiovascular disease and cancer) but
it is rather easy to overcome with the Gerson Therapy. Since
the Therapy deals easily and quickly with the cholesterol
overload, the patient's body becomes able to break down and
eliminate the arteriosclerosis, the kidney and eye problems,
as well as the overload on the heart. We have even seen
painful toes, already cold and white due to lack of
circulation from arteriosclerosis, turn warm and pink again
in a week or two on the Gerson Therapy. </P>
<P>Admittedly, it is much easier to deal with age-onset
diabetes, since it is mostly a cholesterol problem with the
resulting arteriosclerosis and kidney damage. When it comes
to juvenile diabetes, we must remember that we are dealing
with true pancreatic dysfunction with resultant poor insulin
production. We have seen some children with juvenile diabetes
improve eyesight, overcome high blood pressure and kidney
damage. But, since the Islets of Langerhans cannot be
restored to full function, these people have to stay close to
the Gerson Therapy for the rest of their lives. In children
and youngsters that is a tall order. On the other hand, we
have seen one patient, who started on the Gerson Therapy with
&quot;40% irreversible damage to his eyesight&quot; according
to his ophthalmologist, with high blood pressure that was
uncontrollable at over 220; with constant kidney pain and
severe edema - be cleared of all these problems using the
Gerson Therapy . But, after some time, at age 22, he was
tired of adhering to this strict diet and felt he could do
well enough without it. He went back to his former ways, the
standard American diet (SAD), and after a few years, went
blind, went on kidney dialysis and eventually died. </P>
<P>This terrible scenario is not only curable but
preventable. However, prevention is one of the most difficult
approaches to &quot;sell&quot; to the public. People usually
feel that, as long as they are well, nothing can happen to
them, and diseases are for other people. Also, they have a
strong resistance to changing their diet and lifestyle.
Prevention of juvenile diabetes starts with the mother. Even
prior to conception, her diet matters. The typical high fat,
high salt, and high protein American diet is unfortunately
not conducive to good health. The mother's diet should
consist largely of fresh (organic, whenever possible) fruit
and vegetables, raw salads and juices and a little non-fat
unsalted protein food, such as non-fat yogurt or cottage
cheese. Also stimulants and drugs should be omitted: coffee,
alcohol and especially cigarettes, not to speak of street or
physician-administered drugs, tranquilizers, sleeping pills
and pain killers. Please note: on a vegetarian, salt-free,
low animal protein diet, people will naturally be free of
pain, sleep well, have no colds and flu and require no drugs.
</P>
<P>The next area of prevention for the mother is, of course,
during her pregnancy. She again needs large amounts of fresh
fruit and vegetables, raw salads, etc. and fresh vegetable
juices. The usual admonition: &quot;take a lot of proteins,
drink plenty of milk&quot; is completely wrong and could even
be dangerous, as it tends to overload the kidneys and produce
toxemia. A properly nourished mother will have a baby strong
in immune response, free of infections and, if the baby is
breast fed, also free of colic. An easy, relatively painless
birth is an extra bonus. </P>
<P>One of the important preventive reasons why breast
feeding is so essential is the very first fluid which enters
the breast. This is not actual milk, but a transparent fluid,
called colostrum. It is nature's gift to this wonderful new
life and helps to build the baby's immune system, the
friendly bacteria in the intestinal tract, etc. It is
unfortunate that some pediatricians feel that they know
better than nature and tell mothers to discard this first
fluid &quot;since it is not milk&quot; and wait until the
&quot;real milk&quot; comes in before breast feeding is to
begin. </P>
<P>The next important preventive step, of course, is the
actual nutrition of the baby. If the baby is fed good, fresh
live foods, first mother's milk, then fresh vegetables,
mashed bananas, apples and fresh oatmeal rather than boxed
'Pablum' or other artificial cereals, the baby will remain
well with good defenses. One of the first additions to the
child's diet, as early as the second or third month, and even
before oatmeal, should be freshly pressed carrot juice, made
from organic carrots. As the child grows, one must keep items
such as ice cream, cookies, cakes, etc., to the barest
minimum, only for special occasions. In an earlier Healing
Newsletter (Vol. 9, No. 3), we published the devastating
effects on children of hot dogs and other spiced sausage
meats. It is also most important to avoid bottled soft
drinks, especially those containing stimulants, such as the
cola drinks. Again, fresh fruit and vegetable juices (carrot
and apple, for instance) are best. </P>
<H2>Adult Diabetes Prevention</H2>
<P>We now go on to the adult prevention program. Obviously,
since age-onset diabetes is caused largely by excess
cholesterol, we have to come to the same conclusions: a low
animal protein and low fat diet, no deep fried foods, minimum
salt and sweet bottled drinks as well as avoidance of
alcohol, cigarettes, and other stimulants. To keep the body's
defenses at a peak level, with high enzyme function, we must
again have the best, fresh, organic fruit and vegetables,
avoid salt, stimulants and drugs, but use fresh vegetable
juices with only occasional 'treats'. </P>
<P><A href="maxbio.html">
Dr. Gerson</A> wrote about prevention in his book <A
href="booklist.html#acancertherapy">
A Cancer Therapy: Results of 50 Cases </A>. He felt that a
diet consisting of 75% building and highly nutritious
material, and 25% of &quot;your choice&quot; would be
adequate. That was 40 years ago. In the intervening years,
technology has damaged the air, water, soil and foods much
more, with the predictable result that most people's
resistance is much lower. Therefore, I would propose a diet
of 90% building and defensive foods (fresh, organic fruit and
vegetables) with at most 10% &quot;at liberty&quot; for
prevention of disease. </P>

<h2>Healing Modern Diseases with the Gerson Therapy</h2>



<p><b>Chronic Fatigue, Candidiasis, Herpes, Lyme Disease, Salmonella, Legionnaire's Disease, AIDS</b>



<p>by Charlotte Gerson, President, The Gerson Institute

<p><IMG SRC="banner2.gif" alt="*">

<p>These days, we hear the names of many diseases that were totally

unfamiliar or actually unknown some ten or twenty years ago.  I refer to

them as "modern diseases".  Some, such as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS),

are also known as "Yuppy Diseases", after Young Upwardly-mobile

Professionals, those most commonly affected.  The victims of these

diseases are most often middle-class whites, two thirds of them women.  



<h3>Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</h3>



<p>The volume Health Conditions, p. 616, describes Chronic Fatigue Syndrome

as "a mysterious infectious illness" that supposedly existed and was

described in the past as "the vapors", and, after World War I, as

"soldier's heart".  Researchers have failed to find a single cause, but

suspect it to be related to the Epstein-Barr virus infection, with

candidiasis and herpes thrown in.  It is almost certainly caused by

infectious agents, whether one or more is relatively immaterial when we

treat it with the Gerson Therapy.  According to Dr. Murray R.  Susser of

Santa Monica, California, symptoms can include deep fatigue, joint pain or

weakness, headache, memory loss, mental confusion, digestive problems,

allergies and depression.  These can also include anxiety, night sweats

and even irregular heartbeat.  



<p>A young man (age 28) seen at the <a href="center.html">hospital</a> had all of these problems

so severely that he had been bedfast for many months, unable to engage in

any activity.  The doctors accused him of laziness and/or psychiatric

problems and put him into the psychiatric ward.  Drugs administered there

worsened his depression so badly he became suicidal.  At the <a href="center.html">hospital</a>,
 with the intensive Gerson Therapy and detoxification, he was up

in a little more than a week, in great good spirits and dancing with his

mother!  In The Gerson Healing Newsletter, Vol. 9 No. 4, (Nov./Dec.

1994), we described another chronic fatigue patient who recovered

completely on the Gerson Therapy.  He had suffered from almost all of the

above described symptoms.  



<p>Health Conditions further quotes Dr. Susser, saying that he firmly

believes that CFS results from "several ongoing, simultaneous infections

that weaken the immune system."  I believe that it is probably the other

way around: it is a weakened immune system (due to previous infections,

antibiotic and other drug treatments, toxicity from foods and the

environment) that allows various organisms to take up residence in the

body.  Once these have damaged the body, it is much easier for other

opportunistic viruses or germs to add to the problem.



<p>Dr. Susser adds that in CFS "we often get hidden, concomitant parasite,

yeast and viral infections that are the result of a weakened immune

system."  



<p>Here is our cue that CFS is not a simple problem but a combination of

immune deficiency diseases, including candida and possible parasites.



<h3>Candidiasis</h3>



<p>Candidiasis, a fungal invasion, has become extremely common. Candida is

commonly found in many body areas, particularly in the gut and vagina.

Candidiasis regularly develops in people who have undergone severe or

long-term treatments with antibiotics.  The mechanism is quite simple:

since candida commonly inhabits the colon, it shares the available

nutrients with friendly bacteria as well as other organisms.  When

patients are treated with antibiotics, these bacteria are killed off - but

the yeast (Candida) survives and is now no longer deprived of nutrients by

other organisms, it has the area and the nutrients to itself.  It is

important to note that patients who receive antibiotic treatments are

already suffering from some infection and are therefore immune

compromised.  The weakened immune system is then subject to a massive

invasion by candida that was unaffected by antibiotics and against which

the body has no defenses.  



<p>Candida really becomes a problem when it invades other tissues,

particularly the nervous system.  The drugs available for treatment, like

all drugs, are often temporarily effective to control the candida - but

they do not heal.  On the contrary, all drugs are toxic and further damage

and weaken the immune system.  The result is that the candida recurs if

and when the drugs have to be discontinued due to toxic liver damage.  



<p>Since cancer chemotherapy also severely damages the immune system,

virtually all cancer patients who were treated with chemo also suffer from

candidiasis.  Furthermore, even those who have not been treated with

cytotoxic (chemo) drugs suffer from a damaged immune system: they could

not have cancer if their immune system were fully functioning.  We can

therefore assume that they, too, have some degree of candida infection.



<h3>Herpes</h3>



<p>Herpes, or fever sores, have been around for a long time.  Genital herpes,

on the other hand, is a relatively new sexually transmitted disease (STD).

Before the advent of AIDS, it was one of the more serious genitally

transmitted diseases and caused much distress in young people. It, too,

defies treatment Herpes simplex is described as an acute viral infection;

while genital herpes is known to be caused by Herpes Virus 2.  This, too,

is clearly an immune deficiency disease and has been overcome by the

Gerson Therapy.



<p>Another form of Herpes, Herpes Zoster or shingles, is also on the rise.

Not only does it cause extreme pain which is difficult to control, but it

generally does not go away.  The severity of the attack will subside, but

constant and recurring problems, including pain, may persist.  There is no

really effective treatment to overcome and cure this herpes infection

except with the intensive Gerson Therapy.



<h3>Lyme Disease</h3>



<p>Lyme Disease was first observed and described in Lyme, Connecticut.  It

seems to be caused by an infectious agent, transmitted by a tick, and

causes various problems, including in some cases arthritis, erythema

(reddening of skin), Bell's palsy, brain and possible heart abnormalities.

It has been improved by the administration of penicillin, however many

cases persist and develop into serious paralyses, nerve and brain

disorders.  We have seen only one patient who suffered from this problem.

She was in a wheelchair, unable to move or control her limbs, was severely

depressed and her condition was deteriorating.  In only a few days on the

Gerson Therapy her overall problems improved considerably.  I have no

follow-up in this case and am unable to report further progress.



<h3>Salmonella</h3>



<p>This is a topic that has to be treated separately, and is not really a

"modern" disease.  It has several forms ranging from mild to severe

gastro-intestinal inflammation all the way to serious food poisoning.

Other species of salmonella are the causative agents of paratyphoid and

typhoid fever. 



<p>The reason salmonella must be included under "modern" infections is that

in its food poisoning action, it is now killing an increasingly large

number of people in the U.S. annually.  The number of salmonella cases

reported in Los Angeles last year, for instance, increased ten times (from

just over 100, to just over 1,000) over the previous year.



<p>The culprit, to a large extent, is the chicken industry.  We talked about

"The Case Against Chicken" in the Gerson Healing Newsletter, Vol. 9, No.

1, (May/June 1994), but this discussion did not include any of the many

infectious agents found in chicken due to current automated, high-volume,

profit-oriented processing.  Surely many of our readers saw the article in

Time Magazine (Oct. 17, 1994) titled "Something Smells Fowl", and

describing the horrendous and unsanitary conditions found in today's

chicken processing plants.  Aside from salmonella, chicken are generally

infected with Camphylobacter, E.  coli or other micro-organisms, according

to the Time article. "Each year at least 6.5 million and possibly as many

as 80 million people get sick from chicken, and some 1,000 people die,

according to conservative estimates".  Although cooking the meat properly

will generally kill the infectious bacteria, any kitchen surface or

implement that the infected meat touches can also become contaminated and

potentially dangerous.



<p>In discussing the damage done by consuming chicken, neither our own

May/June issue, nor the Time Magazine article touched on the treatment of

the animals while they are alive.  The incubated eggs are injected before

they hatch, since they would otherwise not even produce live chicks.

Chickens are heavily treated with hormones and antibiotics to keep them

alive - and they must generally be slaughtered at a very early age (for

chickens) - or they die of disease.  Yet, with intensive advertising, the

immense (7 billion chickens are slaughtered in the United States annually)

and profitable chicken industry has convinced much of the American public

that eating this septic, decaying, sick and chemical-laced meat is

healthier and preferable to eating red meat because of its lower fat and

cholesterol content.  I am by no means advocating the consumption of red

meat, pork or veal - none of which are the slightest bit healthful.  I am

instead pointing out that eating chicken is not a reasonable choice for a

person wishing to maintain good health.



<p>The above material is presented to give the reader background information

on the increasing dangers of "modern" sources of infection.  But, in my

opinion, all these modern diseases are really only symptoms of the

seriously decreased resistance and damaged immune systems of our current

population.  In all these cases, infections are involved, and in many of

them (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Candidiasis, Genital Herpes, Lyme

Disease), there is no cure by drugs or other orthodox methods.  Yet the

Gerson Therapy has been shown to help people overcome these diseases.

This shows that the Gerson Therapy strengthens and restores the immune

system and thus helps the body to overcome these "incurable" ailments.



<h3>Legionnaires' Disease</h3>



<p>Among "modern diseases," Legionnaire's Disease should also be mentioned,

especially in connection with impaired immune systems.  This "mysterious

new disease" was first described in a number of cases which afflicted

members of the American Legion who were attending a convention in

Philadelphia in 1976.  The disease is a serious type of pneumonia, yet is

often carried without producing disease.  According to the text Current

Medical Diagnosis, Legionnaires' Disease is caused by an opportunistic

germ (meaning that it attacks weakened or defenseless persons) and

generally affects the elderly, smokers and people on dialysis or who have

been given organ transplants.  The latter, of course, must be treated with

immune suppressant agents or their bodies would reject the transplants.

In other words, their immune systems are severely and intentionally

depressed, and they become susceptible to opportunistic infections.



<h3>AIDS</h3>



<p>No discussion of "modern diseases" would be complete without mentioning

Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, or AIDS.  This, as the name

indicates, is the ultimate failure of the immune system.  It stands to

reason, then, that since the Gerson Therapy restores the immune system, it

could well overcome this problem, too.  At present, it is difficult for me

to claim that the Gerson Therapy will cure AIDS.  Due to restrictions

imposed by the Mexican health authorities, we are not allowed to accept

AIDS patients.  As a result, we have not been able to follow AIDS patients

to observe results.  We have seen good recoveries in two cases of patients

who were treated for HIV infections on an out-patient basis.  I feel

uncomfortable making any curative claims for the Gerson Therapy on the

basis of such a small sample.  Yet, one cannot help but assume that, with

the improved immune response produced by the Gerson Therapy as with so

many other diseases, AIDS should respond very well.



<p>Dr. Gerson was aware very early in his career that his Therapy was able to

improve and restore the immune system - since he was able to cure

tuberculosis of all types well before the advent of antibiotics.  I even

remember a case of infantile paralysis in New York that was reversed

almost immediately with the Gerson Therapy.  Obviously the immune system

plays an extremely important role in the treatment of cancer.  The

restored immune response is largely credited with helping the body break

down and dissolve tumor tissue.  Conversely, since all the above diseases

are on the rise, we also have to understand that, due to modern

agricultural methods, food processing methods, damage to our bodies with

toxins, drugs, alcohol, tobacco, with medical drug treatments, etc., our

immune systems are more and more seriously damaged or paralyzed.  In order

to heal anything we have to work to restore the whole body, and with it,

the immune system.  And since the Gerson Therapy does just that, it has

and the Gerson Patient</TITLE></HEAD>
<H2>Chemotherapy and the Gerson Patient</H2>
<H4>by Charlotte Gerson, President, The Gerson
Institute</H4>
<P>During the mid-fifties, just as <A href="maxbio.html">
Dr. Gerson</A> was demonstrating some of his most dramatic
results with a nutritional treatment for cancer, chemotherapy
started to be used by establishment medicine. The reason was
the general disillusion with the results of surgery and
radiation in the treatment of cancer patients. The
chemotherapeutic drugs were supposed to stop the fast
reproduction of tumor cells - and thus stop cancer.
Originally, these highly toxic agents were based on the
mustard gas of warfare of which there was a huge remaining
supply after the end of World War II. When these drugs soon
were found to be too toxic and at best only temporarily
effective, new combinations were compounded all supposedly
stopping or slowing the multiplication of fast growing
tissue. But since there are various tissues in the human body
which must multiply rapidly (bone marrow producing red and
white blood corpuscles which constitute a large part of the
immune system) other very serious side-effects were always
present with the chemotherapy treatments: damage to bone
marrow; poisoning of the liver and often destruction of the
kidneys, not to speak of damage also to the heart. </P>
<P>In spite of over 30 years of use of chemotherapy in the
treatment of cancer patients, and in spite of its status as a
'proven' cancer treatment, these drugs have never been
officially accepted nor do they have the full approval of
FDA. Chemotherapy is still an &quot;experimental&quot;
treatment, largely because it has never undergone 'double
blind' studies. Why not? </P>
<P>Chemotherapy was just being introduced toward the end of
<A href="maxbio.html">
Dr. Gerson</A>'s practice in New York, shortly before he
died. He talks about his experience with Johnny Gunther in
Appendix II of A Cancer Therapy Results of 50 Cases, p. 415.
(See also John Gunther's book, Death Be Not Proud) Johnny was
possibly the only patient <A href="maxbio.html">
Dr. Gerson</A> treated after he had been given chemotherapy.
The book describes the terrible response, the swollen arm,
the severe bone marrow depression and the doctor's
expectation that Johnny would quickly die. Nobody suspected
that <A href="maxbio.html">
Dr. Gerson</A> could reverse some of the damage. But <A
href="maxbio.html">
Dr. Gerson</A> could not have known what the Gerson doctors
in Mexico have discovered after years of working with cancer
patients who had previously been given chemotherapy, namely
that these heavy drugs are released back into the system and
cause the prior poisoning symptoms to show up once more. This
generally happens after some six months on the Gerson
Therapy. That was also Dr. Gerson's experience with Johnny
Gunther - but he did not know that it was due to the prior
chemotherapy treatment. He took the blame for Johnny's death,
assuming that the only cause was the treatment with hormones
which he had applied. </P>
<P>Oncologists using chemotherapy drugs in the treatment of
their cancer patients are told that the body, in time,
excretes these drugs, and that the damage is thus overcome.
It is true that many patients grow hair again after they have
lost it; that their blood count comes back up to near normal
and their mucous membranes heal after breaking down with
ulcers due to the chemotherapy treatments. They overcome the
terrible nausea and vomiting caused by the toxic drugs, the
weakness and depression, etc. (Of course if they suffer also
the loss of kidney function due to the chemotherapeutic
drugs, this does not reverse. The kidneys, once destroyed, do
not recover.) But overcoming the immediate toxicity does not
prove that all the toxic materials have left the body. On the
contrary, the Gerson doctors' experience with patients who
have had prior treatment with chemotherapy gives an entirely
different picture. </P>
<P>When the first Gerson Therapy treatment facility in
Mexico (La Gloria) was started in 1977, we went as closely as
possible by <A href="maxbio.html">
Dr. Gerson</A>'s directions in his book, <A
href="booklist.html#acancertherapy">
A Cancer Therapy </A> . But since <A href="maxbio.html">
Dr. Gerson</A> didn't have any experience with chemotherapy
patients, his book contains no special directions regarding
such patients. No special adjustments were made by the Gerson
doctors for such patients. Our first serious shock came when,
at almost the same time, two patients with previous
chemotherapy treatments were admitted and started on the
Therapy. They received the full intensive treatment,
including the starting medications, five coffee enemas a day,
and the castor oil treatment every other day. As the bodies
of these two patients detoxified intensively, they had all
the symptoms of a chemotherapy overdose. Of course the Gerson
physicians had given none of these drugs. So the only
conclusion was that the drugs still remaining in the body
from treatments many months earlier, were being released
rapidly, in large amounts, poisoning these patients a second
time! They landed in intensive care, they were so ill. The
Gerson doctors were shocked into the realization that
chemotherapy patients could not be treated with the same
protocols as those who had received none of these toxic
drugs. It must also be understood that patients treated with
chemotherapeutic agents often had recurrences which caused
them to seek alternative therapies. </P>
<P>At one point, the results of the Gerson Therapy in
patients with previous chemotherapy treatments were so poor
that we refused to accept such patients. However, in time,
some patients begged to be allowed to come. Others, after
chemotherapy, felt that the Gerson Therapy was so logical and
basic that they tried the Gerson Therapy at home on their own
and, to our great surprise, succeeded! So, it became clear
that it could be done. </P>
<P>With this empirical evidence in hand, the Gerson Therapy
physicians began to treat patients who had received prior
chemotherapy. These patients were given less intensive
medications; they were given only two or three coffee enemas
daily instead of the regular five. They were not given castor
oil treatments, in order to avoid sudden and intensive
detoxification and they improved. It was now a question
whether this less intensive treatment would work fast enough
and well enough to stop the advance of the cancer, yet not so
fast as to cause an overdose of the chemotherapeutic
chemicals being pushed out of their systems. In many cases,
it worked. Admittedly, the results in cases where patients
had received prior chemotherapy were sharply reduced compared
to those who received no such toxic drugs. But, in many
cases, we were still able to obtain recoveries. </P>
<P>We did find out, however, that certain cancers do not
respond after chemotherapy. Pancreatic cancer, which shows
excellent results on the Gerson Therapy, does not respond
after the patient had received chemotherapy. The same goes
for cancers that have extensively metastasized (spread) into
the liver. Leukemias, after heavy chemotherapy, are also
difficult to reverse with the Gerson Therapy. Brain tumors
fall into the same category. Melanomas, which usually respond
exceptionally well to the Gerson Therapy, do relatively
poorly after chemotherapy. All types of lymphomas do
relatively well on the Gerson Therapy despite chemotherapy;
the same goes for ovarian cancers. Of course, all types of
cancer respond much better with no prior toxic drug
treatments. </P>
<P>According to various sources, after the administration of
chemotherapy, the patient's body excretes somewhere between
35% and 50% of the drugs given. The problem for a researcher
is to prove this statement. Unfortunately, there are no true
tests for toxicity in the system. I personally feel that the
remaining toxic drugs could be lodged in the connective or
fatty tissues. They cannot possibly remain in the liver; this
essential organ would be poisoned beyond function. But all
drug tests are performed on serum or blood samples, not solid
tissues. Fluids do not show positive for these agents simply
because the drugs are not circulating, but are lodged in some
tissue. </P>
<P>The reason we feel so certain that poisons remain in the
body after chemotherapy treatments, even up to two years
later, is that we see the patients excreting them. In the
course of the Gerson Therapy, patients typically go through
healing crises, or &quot;Flare-Ups,&quot; described by <A
href="maxbio.html">
Dr. Gerson</A> in <A href="booklist.html#acancertherapy">
A Cancer Therapy </A> , pp. 201-203. During these flare-ups
we see that the patient's body excretes many accumulated
toxins. Often, these toxins are readily identifiable by their
odors. When patients who had prior chemo go through these
detoxifying 'flare-up' days, they experience the same
symptoms they originally felt while they were receiving the
chemotherapeutic agents: they feel nauseous, taste the
chemicals, smell the drugs in their stool, have some loss of
hair, mouth ulcers, and temporarily depressed red and white
blood cell counts. Since we have learned to treat and
detoxify these patients cautiously, we find that the heavy
chemotherapy drug releases can happen at about six months
into the Gerson Therapy. At that time the patient either
recovers or goes into decline. </P>
<P>Since our experience with patients who have had prior
chemotherapy is always questionable, we have often refused to
admit patients who had received a &quot;bone marrow
transplant.&quot; These patients are treated extremely
heavily with chemotherapeutic chemicals, after their bone
marrow is removed. The marrow is then returned, on the theory
that since it has remained free of the toxic drugs, it will
continue to function. In fact, that does not happen, since
the drugs continue to circulate in the body and, of course,
soon contaminate the 'clean' bone marrow. </P>
<P>One patient, suffering from ovarian cancer, and showing
poor results after several courses of chemotherapy, was given
a bone marrow transplant at a cost upward of $150,000.00.
This treatment did not control her cancer, which continued to
spread. She then called us and wished to be admitted to the
<A href="center.html">
hospital </A> for the Gerson Therapy. However, while she
admitted to being heavily treated with chemotherapy, she did
not tell the Gerson physicians about receiving a bone marrow
transplant. So, with a warning that chemotherapy patients do
not respond as well as those who have not been pretreated,
she was accepted for the Gerson Therapy. She was given the
less intensive therapy, developed specifically for patients
who have had prior chemotherapy, and responded quite well.
Her symptoms and blood counts improved. However, as expected,
after six months from the start of the Gerson Therapy, she
went into a heavy 'healing reaction'. In her case, this
consisted of abscesses breaking out all over her body. These
boils released pus, and, of course, she was very
uncomfortable during a few weeks. Nevertheless, she worked
through it - and after it was over, was much better. We have
to assume that, in her case, much of the heavy poisoning was
excreted through the skin. </P>
<P>There are more and more reports by establishment
oncologists doubting the value of chemotherapy, even to the
point of rejecting it outright. One of these, cancer
biostatistician Dr. Ulrich Abel, of Heidelberg, Germany,
issued a monograph titled Chemotherapy of Advanced Epithelial
Cancer in 1990. (See Healing Journal, No. 1-2, Vol.7 of the
Gerson Institute.) Epithelial cancers comprise the most
common forms of adenocarcinoma: lung, breast, prostate,
colon, etc. After ten years as a statistician in clinical
oncology, Abel became increasingly uneasy. &quot;A sober and
unprejudiced analysis of the literature,&quot; he wrote,
&quot;has rarely revealed any therapeutic success by the
regimens in question in treating advanced epithelial
cancer.&quot; While chemotherapy is being used more and more
extensively, more than a million people die worldwide of
these cancers annually - and a majority have received some
form of chemotherapy before dying. Abel further concluded,
after polling hundreds of cancer doctors, &quot;The personal
view of many oncologists seems to be in striking contrast to
communications intended for the public.&quot; Abel cited
studies that have shown &quot;that many oncologists would not
take chemotherapy themselves if they had cancer.&quot; (The
Cancer Chronicles, December, 1990.) &quot;Even though toxic
drugs often do effect a response, a partial or complete
shrinkage of the tumor, this reduction does not prolong
expected survival,&quot; Abel finds. &quot;Sometimes, in
fact, the cancer returns more aggressively than before, since
the chemo fosters the growth of resistant cell lines.&quot;
Besides, the chemo has severely damaged the body's own
defenses, the immune system and often the kidneys as well as
the liver. </P>
<P>In an especially dramatic table, Dr. Abel displays the
results of chemotherapy in patients with various types of
cancers, as the improvement of survival rates, compared to
untreated patients. </P>
<P>This table shows:</P>
<UL><LI>In colorectal cancer: no evidence survival is
improved. </LI>
<LI>Gastric cancer: no clear evidence. </LI>
<LI>Pancreatic cancer: Study completely negative. Longer
survival in control (untreated) group. </LI>
<LI>Bladder: no clinical trial done. </LI>
<LI>Breast cancer: No direct evidence that chemotherapy
prolongs survival; its use is &quot;ethically
questionable.&quot; (That is particularly newsworthy, since
all breast cancer patients, before or after surgery, are
given chemotherapy drugs.) </LI>
<LI>Ovarian cancer: no direct evidence. </LI>
<LI>Cervix and uterus: No improved survival. </LI>
<LI>Head and neck: no survival benefit but occasional
shrinkage of tumors. </LI>
</UL>
<P>More recently, the Nov. 17, 1994 Wall Street Journal, in
a front page article on political pressure being exerted for
insurance companies to pay for bone marrow transplants in
advanced breast cancer, experts give a totally negative
report on this approach. The procedure, called ABMT
(Autologous Bone Marrow Transplant) involves temporarily
removing some of the patient's bone marrow, applying a
potentially lethal dose of chemotherapy, then returning the
marrow to the patient's body. The cost of this procedure is
in excess of $100,000.00 . </P>
<P>The University of Colorado's Dr. Jones, continues the
Journal, claims that, with conventional chemotherapy, not
more than 2% of patients with spreading breast cancer get a
positive response. A non-profit independent technology
assessment agency, the Emergency Care Research Institute
(ECRI), says that for the average woman with the most
advanced form of breast cancer, the high dose ABMT procedure
is not only worthless, but also likely to shorten her life.
This report by the ECRI is based on an analysis of 40 studies
of ABMT and similar procedures involving a total of 1,017
patients, and 61 studies covering 4,852 patients who had
conventional chemotherapy. Dr. Nelson Erlick, the project's
lead analyst, concluded that &quot;many patients are led to
believe that this (ABMT) is a successful therapy. We found no
evidence whatsoever that it provides any benefit.&quot; </P>
<P>Since the Gerson Therapy is often described by orthodox
oncologists as 'quackery', we'd like our readers to consider
this: If quackery describes an expensive treatment that the
technician knows ahead of time to be ineffective (or even
harmful), what is ABMT (bone marrow transplant)? Yet health
plan providers are being ordered to pay for it by the Office
of Personnel Management, a federal agency. </P>

<img src="cgerson1.gif" alt="Graphic Image" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=20 VSPACE=4><FONT SIZE=+2>Clinical Depression ...  a Biochemical Problem</FONT>

<BR>by Charlotte Gerson, President, The Gerson Institute



<P>Clinical Depression is a subject that could well have been included

in our last Healing Newsletter as a 'modern disease'.  Of course

depression is not new; it has been plaguing people for centuries.

However, recently it has been accepted as a disease syndrome and as

being 'treatable'.  This means that it can be drug treated.  It is

depressing just to read the symptoms given: (Current Medical

Diagnosis & Treatment, Krupp & Chatton)



o Lowered mood, sadness to intense feelings of guilt and hopelessness



o Difficulty in thinking, inability to concentrate, inability to make decisions

o Loss of interest, less involvement with work and recreation



o Headache, disrupted sleep, change in appetite, decreased sexual drive



o Anxiety



o Suicidal tendencies



<P>As the disease progresses, the symptoms become more severe.  In all

orthodox approaches to disease, the symptoms are treated, not the

underlying problems.  The present drugs of choice are the mood

altering medications, one example of which is imipramine.  



<P>Years ago, we saw a patient who had been treated with imipramine for

some 15 years.  Her depression and anxiety were still present, but

had been more or less controlled by the drug.  The side effects,

however, were almost unbearable: she was virtually blind, could just

identify her own hand held in front of her eyes; and she was still

depressed.  But the patient's worst symptom was the constant feeling

of worms crawling under her skin and out of all her body openings.

Her symptoms intensified if she didn't take the drug.  In only a few

days on the Gerson Therapy, her vision had improved to near normal

and her mood was a great deal better.  The 'crawling' sensations,

however, took longer to relieve.  More recently, we had a patient who

was being treated for lymphoma.  She had been on the Gerson Therapy

for some time, but came back to the <a href="center.html">hospital</a> for hyperbaric

oxygen treatments.  She mentioned, one day, that she was experiencing

a crawling sensation under her skin.  I asked her if she had ever

been treated for depression with antidepressant drugs.  She thought a

moment and then replied, yes, some 35 years ago, after the birth of

her daughter.  These drugs were still lodged in her system and only

just being excreted in the course of a healing reaction on the Gerson

Therapy.  When they reentered the bloodstream, she re-experienced the

same symptoms she felt when the drug was first administered.  Since

drugs do not overcome the underlying problems, they are often

administered for years, yet never clear the disease.



<P>Brain dysfunctions are generally referred to as mental diseases.  To

many, this classification implies genetic problems, and carries the

stigma of being crazy or demented.  Often, in fact, these diseases

are metabolic disorders, and therefore curable by healing the

metabolism.



<P>The brain is an incredibly delicate and finely balanced instrument..

It also requires substantially more oxygen than other tissues.  While

it only constitutes only about 6-8% of total body mass, it is

believed to require as much as 20% of the system's total oxygen

intake.  



<P>As in all chronic diseases, the underlying problems in brain

malfunction are toxicity and deficiency.  The Standard American Diet

(SAD) is generally at fault.  



<P>Ross Horne, in his book, The Health Revolution, has reproduced two

interesting photomicrographs from Dr.  Ronald Glasser's The Body is

the Hero.  In it, we see the effect of a high-fat meal on red blood

corpuscles (cells).  In order to properly fulfill their oxygen

transport function, red blood corpuscles should float freely and

independently in the bloodstream, exposing the maximum surface area

to adsorb, carry and release oxygen.  However, after a high-fat meal,

the cells that should float freely (see Figure 2) become stuck

together and clumped into rolls, much like the rolls of coins one

gets at the bank, see Figure 1.  These rolls are called rouleaux.

The photomicrograph shows that a large proportion of red blood

corpuscles are still forming rouleaux six hours after a high fat

meal.  When they are glued together, blood cells have a much reduced

total surface area, thus can carry much less oxygen.  Furthermore,

these rouleaux are too large and inflexible to travel through the

tiny capillaries (hair vessels) and deliver their life-supporting

oxygen to the most remote cells in the circulatory system.  With the

brain's high oxygen requirement, it cannot function properly under

conditions of oxygen starvation.  This explains why people experience

sleepiness and lack of energy after a heavy meal.  They often try to

overcome the 'depression' by the use of stimulants: coffee, alcohol

or cigarettes.  It takes some six to ten hours for the body to clear

the fat from the bloodstream and "unclump" the red blood cells.

Within six hours, however, most people will have consumed another

fatty meal: breakfast with eggs and bacon or sausage; lunch with a

hamburger or hot-dog; dinner with meat, chicken, cheese, milk,

butter, or other high-fat substances.  The result is that we live in

a constant state of oxygen starvation when we eat diets high in fat

content.  Yet this describes the SAD diet precisely.  40% or more of

the calories the average American consumes come from the fat content

of our food.  Our brains and other vital organs are being slowly

strangled, deprived of their life-giving oxygen.



<P>In addition to fat and cholesterol, the SAD diet contains many

chemical additives: dyes, preservatives, emulsifiers, flavor

enhancers, plus residual pesticides, hormones, and antibiotics from

animal products.  Some 10,000 chemicals are accepted as food

additives, certified safe by our Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

In our opinion, no chemical food additives are safe for daily

ingestion! It has been amply demonstrated that hyperactive children

become perfectly normal when they are placed on a diet free of food

additives.  Instead of using this approach, however, orthodox doctors

use drugs such as phenobarbital to calm these children.  But

psychoactive drugs, used over a period of time, can themselves cause

brain damage! All toxic substances, including food additives, are

enzyme inhibitors, further depressing the normal functions of brain

cells.  Is it surprising that people become depressed, hyperactive,

aggressive, and suicidal? (Suicide is one of the leading causes of

death among teenagers.) I must admit that I am always impressed with

the fact that so many people function as well as they do, as long as

they do, given what they eat.  



<P>But are we really functioning fully? Nathan Pritikin describes how

"children whose diets are changed from the typical Western high-fat

diet to a diet low in fat, can perform simple mental tasks 20% faster

and with greater accuracy once their blood is clear of fat."

Pritikin asks, "Does our entire population struggle along at about

75% of their mental capacity? Is this why our television programs

are so infantile?" But what if we go further than eliminating fats

from the children's diet? What if we also eliminate food additives

and other toxins and sugar? What if we give our children the best

high-micronutrient diet, such as a less intensive Gerson Therapy,

could we increase their mental capacity by much more than 20%? And

would this not also hold true for the rest of us?



<P>In conclusion, clinical depression is not just treatable (by drugs),

it is curable.  The answer to chronic disease is always the same:

once you understand the underlying problems, deficiency and toxicity,

and solve those, the body is capable of healing.  Detoxifying and

flooding the body with a high nutrient diet, the Gerson Therapy, is

the total approach to healing.

<title>Alternative Therapies</title>
<body>
<center><h1>Alternative Therapies</h1>
<h2>Slowly gaining mainstream acceptance </h2>

<h6>by Charlotte Gerson, President, The Gerson Institute</h6></center>

On January 1, 1996, the Los Angeles Times carried a front page article titled New Life for Old Remedies.  We felt this to be a very important development.  Our members and other friends will surely find it encouraging that "old remedies" (the true healing
 of herbs, nutrition, acupuncture, homeopathy, etc.), according to this article, are once again finding acceptance.  Since orthodox doctors, too, are spokesmen, we would like to report in some detail on this front-page news article.<p>
The article"s subtitle reads: "No longer dismissed as fringe ideas, such "traditional" therapies as acupuncture and herbs are going mainstream.  Once-wary doctors are using them to complement conventional medicine." The article was written by Marlene Cimons, Los Angeles Times Staff Writer.  <P>
The article opens with a report on a patient suffering cruelly from one of the most violent pains known: trigeminal neuralgia.  The pain is caused by a nerve inflammation in the cheek.  Narcotics and nerve blocks gave this patient only little relief, and 
had severe side effects: the patient was unable to sleep, couldn't concentrate and suffered from depression.   The physician who was finally consulted, Dr. Brian Berman in Baltimore used homeopathic remedies, derived from herbs.  Within six months, the pain receded by two-thirds.  The patient continues to use these remedies, and is able to keep the pain under control.<P>
The author continues: "Now many other doctors are beginning to do the same thing.  They have discovered that integrating the unconventional with the mainstream not only can provide relief but also can do so with fewer side effects and without more invasive procedures, such as surgery." More and more scientific evidence is strengthening approaches once considered radical or alternative, that are now being considered "complementary".   The article claims that many physicians, "even those most resistant to alternative medicine," are now taking a second look.  The article quotes Dr. Nancy Dickey, a family practice physician, chair of the board of trustees of the American Medical Association, a most conservative even reactionary organization.  Dr. Dickey admitted that "if I had a patient who said, "I quit using codeine since I started doing acupuncture", I'd say, "Terrific"."<p>
Since these so-called "alternative" methods are, in fact, the ancient and original approaches to treatment of illness, they are actually "traditional" medicine.  Outside of the United States, they are referred to as such.  According to the World Health Organization of the United Nations, 65% to 80% of the worlds health care services are what we would call alternative.  Dr. Wayne B.  Jonas, director of the National Institutes of Health Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM), is quoted as saying that "These 
become complementary, alternative or unconventional when used in Western countries.  Even in countries where modern Western biomedicine dominates, the public makes extensive use of unconventional practices."<p>
A 1990 study showed that one in three Americans saw an alternative health care practitioner that year.  More than 80% used alternatives in conjunction with conventional medicine, according to the NIH.   However, an item in The Cancer Chronicles, published
 by People Against Cancer, discusses a summer 1993 convention of the AMA, in the course of which delegates proposed a resolution condemning "recognition and endorsement of non-scientific alternative medical care paltriness".  This was done in the name of 
"freedom and patient's rights"! According to the logic of B. J. Kennedy, MD, a delegate from the American Society of Clinical Oncology, "Use of these therapies interferes with patients' access to regular medical care."<p>
According to a report under the heading of "Abstracts" in the journal Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine, January 1996, Vol.  2, No.  1, "A survey by David Eisenberg and colleagues indicated that in 1990, consumers made an estimated 425 million 
visits to providers of alternative therapies (they also made 388 million visits to primary care physicians) and spent $13.7 billion , mostly out-of-pocket (they spent $12.8 billion out-of-pocket for all hospitalizations during the same period).  It was estimated that one of three Americans used alternative therapies in 1990, and most did not tell their physicians they were using these therapies." <p>
After the results were in from a carefully designed questionnaire, the journal continues, "180 physicians returned completed questionnaires; 70% to 90% considered many alternative therapies to be legitimate and a majority had referred patients to nonphysicians or used these therapies in their own practice.  Of the respondents, 70% expressed interest in training in multiple areas of alternative medicine."<p>
Medical schools are beginning to add training in alternative therapies to their curricula.  "Insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other health plans have begun to cover alternative treatments in part," the author continues, "because they often cost less than standard procedures, and also because customers want them."<p>
A most interesting item follows: it seems that physicians themselves have become "consumers of alternative medicine" says Dr. James Gordon, chairman of the program advisory council of the NIHs OAM.  "I've certainly seen physicians change because they had
 a health problem that was not helped by conventional therapy."  Dr. Gordon had injured his back and obtained no relief from "orthodox" remedies, but was apparently helped by an osteopath. <P> 
"The NIH's Jonas points out that a new drug's average "half-life" or period of peak use is about 20 years.  Homeopathy has been around, unchanged, for almost 200 years, acupuncture for more than 2,000 years, prayer and spiritualism for at least 20,000 years.  And if one believes reports of monkeys using plant products to regulate their menstrual cycles, herbalism, probably the oldest, has been around for greater than 200,000 years." <p>
Homeopathy was originally introduced from Europe by Dr. Hahnemann and is based on the idea of "like cures like".  Homeopathy consists of treating a disease by giving highly diluted preparations of substances that, in larger doses, actually cause the same 
symptoms.   The author of the article quotes several success stories with alternative medicine, including that of the wife of a physician, herself a nurse, who could not stand the side effects of the painkillers she was taking to treat fibromyalgia.  She 
was highly skeptical but, with acupuncture, homeopathy and herbs, she could wean herself off drugs.  [The wife of a patient at the Gerson Treatment Center, who was suffering from fibromyalgia, was cleared of her pain in three days by simply eating the organic vegetarian, unsalted foods served at the hospital.] <p>
Many doctors are still resistant to alternative medicine, partly because they feel that there is not enough scientific evidence demonstrating its effectiveness, and that most of what evidence there is, though striking, is "anecdotal".  Dr. Berman predicts
 that it will take another decade for society to undergo a major transformation in its acceptance of alternative therapies.  He feels it will only happen when there is enough "scientific" evidence to prove these therapies effective.  The author also admits that even though doctors are more and more willing to turn to alternative medicine, the medical establishment in the United States is so strong that it is still able to define what "health care" should be.   Physicians are still being taught that alternatives are mostly folk medicine, supposedly a "less evolved" form of medicine.<P>
The fact remains, however, that the public is becoming demonstrably more disenchanted with the ineffective treatments of allopathic, technological medicine, especially for degenerative diseases, and is "voting with their feet" by their patronage of alternative practitioners, for the ancient methods that still work.<p>

Patient Story: Cure of a Brain Tumor</TITLE></HEAD>
<CENTER><H2>Patient Story: Cure of a Brain Tumor</H2>
<P><BR> </P>
<H3>by Charlotte Gerson</H3>
</CENTER><P>The aim of the Gerson Therapy is always to heal
and restore people to a normal active life. We sometimes get
phone calls and information from some of these cured people
with wonderful stories that we need to share with our
readers. We should also like to stress that we love to hear
from you people out there after you have been well for some
time. Don't for a moment think that we are no longer
interested in your recovery. On the contrary, the longer you
are well, the more important and dramatic the story! Please
keep in touch and let us know.</P>
<P>One such wonderful success story is that of Nora K. of
North Liberty, Indiana. Just weeks from her 10th birthday,
she started to suffer from headaches, then vomiting. Her
mother took her for a CAT scan and a brain tumor was
discovered. She then was taken to the Riley Children's
Hospital in Indianapolis and was scheduled for surgery. The
surgeon removed what he could, but some of the tumor was too
close to a blood vessel and was only cauterized. This, of
course, left the door open to more tumor growth.
Subsequently, Nora went for yearly check-ups. When she was
13, an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) showed a recurrence.
The doctor said that at this point, he couldn't do anything,
&quot;the tumor wasn't big enough to operate&quot;. Nora's
mother, Mary, felt that she couldn't just sit by and wait for
her daughter's tumor to grow. She started to read and
research. She found the Gerson Therapy. </P>
<P>In 1990, Mary and Nora came to the Mexican hospital and
started the Gerson Therapy. Nora was on the Therapy,
strictly, for one and a half years. During this time, with
the frequent coffee enemas and juices, Nora did not go to a
public school, but had home schooling. She also spent a great
deal of time with coffee enemas on the bathroom floor. She
used this time constructively: she read all the classics she
could get her hands on, then she read Plato and other
philosophers, then she went on to read science books and
math. She got a tremendous education. When she took her
SAT's, she scored extremely high; on her State equivalency
test her score was almost perfect. With all her background
and reading, she also became an excellent writer. </P>
<P>At the end of her intensive Therapy, she had another
check-up with her neurosurgeon. He took some pictures,
studied them, was puzzled, hesitated, took some more pictures
- and finally said that he couldn't see any more tumor, just
a shadow which he felt was a scar. Nora's mother asked what
Nora's prognosis was. The surgeon said that she would never
have a problem again! Nora was also playing the violin. The
doctor was very pleased that she could play the violin and
this was a very good sign, since the type of tumor she was
suffering from would affect the fine motor skills. He said
that she would not be able to play the violin with a tumor in
her brain, these delicate motor skills would have been
disturbed.</P>
<P>After one and a half years on the strict Therapy, Nora
switched to a maintenance therapy: she was still taking 2 - 3
quarts of juice daily and eating organic food. Her mother
started an organic co-op business, helping to supply herself
and a number of other people in the area with organic food.
Mary K. says that she is now helping some 40 people to obtain
their organic produce. Nora is 19 years old, and has been
admitted to college. Not only that, but she obtained a
Presidential Scholarship, a very high honor, and hopes to
study medicine - alternative medicine - to help others as she
was helped.</P>

<title>From Charlotte Gerson's Clinical Notebook</title>

<CENTER><img src="cgerson1.gif" alt="*"></CENTER>



<h3>From Charlotte Gerson's Clinical Notebook</h3>

<h3>M.D.s Use Gerson Therapy To Cure Themselves: Colon Cancer, Breast Cancer</h3>



<h3>Colon Cancer with Liver Metastases</h3>



<p>On Sep.  8, 1994, Yoshihiko Hochino, Professor of Medicine at Japan's Fukushima 

University Medical School published an article in a Japanese health journal.  About four 

years ago, he found that he had colon cancer, spreading (metastases) to the liver.  Since 

he is a professor of medicine, he was very much aware of the fact that orthodox medicine 

(surgery or chemotherapy) has nothing to offer patients with this problem.  He found Dr.  

Max Gerson's book, A Cancer Therapy, which was translated into Japanese some 5 years 

ago.  Using this book, he treated and cured himself completely.  It is now  some four years 

later, and he remains in good health, 'cured' (by his own claim in the article).



<p>Australian Nelly Goldfeld had essentially the same problem.  It began  with colon cancer 

four years ago, and was treated with surgery for the removal of the tumor.  But, since the 

tumor is just 'the tip of the iceberg', and removing it doesn't clear the underlying problem, 

the cancer almost always recurs.  It recurred in Nelly's case, in her liver.



<p>Like Professor Hochino, she vowed to beat this cancer, even though her doctors gave her little hope 

of survival.  They told Nelly that they could try 'experimental' laser treatment, with little chance of 

effectiveness. Nelly then learned about the Gerson Therapy.  A newspaper report in Doncaster and Templestowe 

News, an Australian newspaper, on October 5, 1994 tells Nelly's story.  She started the Gerson T

herapy on Feb. 14th, 'stocking her house full of fresh fruit and vegetables, vitamin supplements, 

a juicer and water purifier.' We quote from the above newspaper story: "Nelly still remembers the 

bewildered look on her doctor's face when she went to have an ultrasound just ten days after 

taking up the diet.  They were astounded.  The doctor said to me: 'Well it seems you've scared

 them off, Mrs.  Goldfeld.'  Three of the cancerous lesions had completely disappeared, and 

the fourth had substantially decreased in size."



<p>"Seven months later, Nelly has returned to being the rosy-cheeked grandmother she 

once was.  She believes she has fulfilled her vow to rid her body of cancer.



<p>"It's not easy, but I have my life.  For the first two months, I was too weak to do all 

he work myself, so we got someone in to help us.  But after that, I got so much energy 

and was able to do everything myself.



<p>"Nelly's claims are backed up by her medical reports, which show a rapid improvement 

in her health from the time of her ultrasound.  'My case is not exceptional.  There are 

hundreds like me.  I just hope people read about this (Gerson) Therapy before they go and 

have chemical or radiation treatment.' "



<p><b>Dr. Lorraine Day</b>



<p>We had the great pleasure of meeting Dr.  Lorraine Day at the annual convention 

of the Cancer Control Society in September of 1994.  At that time, Dr.  Day told her 

story.  She had developed breast cancer, but recovered after refusing mutilating surgery, 

radiation and chemotherapy.



<p>Most impressive was her statement that she rejected "traditional" therapies because 

she studied the medical literature - which proved to her that these treatments are 

ineffective! Why are patients not given this information, available to professionals? Dr.  

Day says she came to the common sense conclusion that "you cannot destroy the immune 

system and get well at the same time." She discovered  nutritional healing, the Gerson 

Therapy, and says: "CANCER DOESN'T SCARE ME ANYMORE!"



<p>Dr.  Lorraine Day has the courage to defy orthodox medicine by getting up 

before the entire audience of the Cancer Control Society and testifying, as follows:



<p>"I am Dr.  Lorraine Day.  Some of you know me from the book I wrote: AIDS 

What the Government Isn't Telling You.  Several years ago, I actually spoke here 

about AIDS.  I have been coming to the Cancer Control Society meetings regularly for 

three years and I have learned more about medicine and how to take care of yourself 

than I learned in 20 years as an orthodox trauma surgeon.  I knew nothing about nutrition 

as a medical doctor.  In the four years of medical school, you don't have one single 

hour of information on nutrition.  I have talked about that and admitted that I, in the 

past, have told patients that their nutrition has really nothing to do with their health.  I 

was ignorant, I was stupid as many orthodox medical doctors are.  Fortunately, I found 

out what was really going on in the health field by coming to the Cancer Control Society, 

and I started speaking out about it, studying it and actually had a radio show called 

"Truth Serum" where I was interviewing many alternative doctors.  In the middle of that, 

I found out that I had breast cancer.  I had infiltrating ductal carcinoma and it was 

spreading through my breast.



<p>I went to my first doctor to have the lump taken out.  At that time I did not 

know it was cancer.  He refused to take care of me unless I had pre-operative 

chemotherapy.  Even though I told him that I was a physician, and that I would sign 

any papers releasing him from any legal liability - but that I didn't want chemotherapy.  I 

just wanted the lump taken out and diagnosed.  He said, No.  His reputation was at 

stake.  So, I walked out of his office realizing that the law considers it acceptable for 

a physician to abandon a patient if the patient refuses the doctor's prescription.  So I 

went to a former resident colleague, who is a breast cancer surgeon.  He took the lump 

out but he couldn't get all the cancer.  He said, 'You have to have your breast removed.' 

I refused. Then he said, 'If you don't have your breast removed, you must have radiation 

therapy.' Once again, I declined. Then he said, 'You must have chemotherapy or some 

other kind of treatment to destroy these cancer cells.' I told him, 'No.  I brought you a 

whole stack of books, if you really want to learn about cancer.  Read these books.  I 

won't have any of the orthodox treatments just take the lump out.' He said that he 

could not get all the cancer.  I said, 'Fine.  Everybody gets cancer all the time.  My 

body can take care of that!' 



<p>I immediately went home and called up Marilyn Barnes, whom you just heard 

earlier.  (Marilyn Barnes had just previously testified to her total recovery, now over 

14 years, from stage 4 melanoma as well as carcinoma in situ - cervical cancer on the 

Gerson Therapy.) [Marilyn] came to my house and set me up.  She taught a woman I 

hired how to do the Gerson Therapy.  The Gerson Therapy was going to be the basis 

of my treatment.  I started the juices, the enemas, the whole business.  In fact, I 

looked at cancer as a great adventure.  Unfortunately, I didn't have the time to take 

all the different alternatives, but I tried as many as I could.  But the Gerson Diet is 

the basis of all my treatment. I am fine.  I am healthy.  I don't have any evidence of 

cancer.  It has only been close to a year, but I have absolute confidence that I'll 

be well and healthy for many, many years to come."



<p>Dr.  Lorraine Day has impressive credentials.  She is an internationally acclaimed 

orthopedic trauma surgeon and author.  She was for 15 years on the faculty of the 

University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine as Associate Professor 

and Vice Chairman of the Department of Orthopedics.  She was also Chief of Orthopedic 

Surgery at San Francisco General Hospital and is recognized world-wide as an AIDS 

expert.  She has been invited to lecture extensively throughout the U.S.  and the 

world; appeared on numerous radio and television shows, including 60 Minutes, 

Nightline, CNN Crossfire, Oprah Winfrey, and Larry King Live.  



<p><b>NOTE:</b> With both a Japanese and an American Professor of Medicine 

rejecting orthodox treatments for their cancers and curing themselves using the 

Gerson Therapy, we now see two examples of highly placed medical  professionals 

who are willing to speak out publicly and report their recoveries on alternative 

cancer treatments.  There have been other doctors who used the Gerson Therapy 

and cured themselves but who would  not allow us to use their names, nor did 

they permit us to refer Gerson Therapy  patients to them.

<h2>Patricia Spain Ward</h2>

<p><img src="banner1.gif" alt="*">

<p>Patricia Spain Ward, author of "History of the Gerson Therapy", is one of a

baker's dozen best medical historians in the United States.  This paper was

originally written by Dr. Ward under a contract to the U.S. Congressional

Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) during its evaluation of alternative

methods of cancer management. This article, along with two others by Dr.

Ward, were suppressed by OTA staff until their release under pressure from

U.S. Senator Charles Grassley of the Technology Assessment Board of

Congress. Her experience with OTA, the process which led to drastic changes

in the "Unconventional Cancer Treatments" document, and her impressions of

important participants in that process, have had a significant impact on

her and on U.S. cancer medicine.

<html> <title>Programs and Financial Arrangements</title> 
<h1>Programs Available and Financial
Arrangements</h1> <p> Hospital Meridian provides a variety of
programs to accommodate individual needs.  These include 3-5 day
visits for rejuvenation or follow-up maintenance, as well as 3-6 week
programs of intensive therapy for more serious conditions.  All
hospital charges listed below are considered to be deposits against
reimbursement by useful private health insurance programs.<p>

Hospital Meridian charges include all standard therapies, normal lab
work, and most adjunctive therapies.  Some other hospitals may charge
a lower daily rate, but your billing for additional tests, adjunctive
therapies, and other services can often reach $1,000 per week.  At
Hospital Meridian, any extra charges are for extraordinary, high-cost
services such as Ultraviolet Blood Irradiation, Live Cell Therapy,
Surgical Procedures, or similar non-standard services.<p>

Our charges are $4,500 per week, or $700 per day for stays of less
than one week. We strongly encourage patients to bring a companion,
as it is very important to have a friend or family member learn
the therapy so that it may be continued at home. Patients who are
very ill or non-ambulatory may require an additional assistant, as
private nursing care is not provided.  The charge for a companion is
$44.00 per day, which includes a bed in the patient's room, 3 meals
and 3 juices.<p>

Payment may be made by cash, cashiers check, traveler's check,
American Express, Visa or MasterCard. A cash deposit of the first
week's charges will be required upon admission to the hospital.
Additional charges (if any) will be collected weekly in advance.<p>

<h3>Insurance Reimbursement:</h3>

Although Hospital Meridian does not accept insurance assignment,
Meridian Health Systems can process your health insurance claim to
assist you in receiving the maximum benefits allowable. For details,
contact the hospital administrator.  Hospital Meridian is located
just 30 minutes from downtown San Diego, California.<p>

<blockquote>The Gerson Therapy is an intensive, nutrition-based and detoxifying medical
treatment for cancer, heart disease, diabetes and other chronic, degenerative diseases.  It works
closely with nature to help the sick body to rid itself of disease through the supportive effects of
simple foods, juices, and non-toxic medication.  Its successes in curing the dread diseases of our
times for the past 75 years have no parallel in the conventional medical context.<p>
The Gerson Institute is a non-profit organization dedicated to the holistic treatment of degenerative diseases. We strive to educate the public on the benefits of holistic healing through worldwide lectures and seminars, publication and distribution of literature on the Gerson Therapy, Training programs for Physicians, Healthcare practitioners, and home care assistants, and through establishing ties to approved clinics and treatment centers.

<h2>Victory in CDA Case!</h2>
<p>
On Wednesday June 12 at 9:00 am, a panel of three federal judges
in Philadelphia, PA granted the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition's (CIEC) request for a preliminary injunction
against the Communications Decency Act (CDA).   In a unanimous decision,
the judges ruled that the CDA would unconstitutionally restrict speech on
the Internet.
<P>
This is a major victory for Netizens!  The ruling soundly rejects
Congressional attempts to censor the Internet.  However, the government
will most certainly appeal this case to the Supreme Court, so the battle
against the CDA is not yet over.  All Internet users are encouraged to
join the fight against the CDA as the case moves to the Supreme Court.

In response to a complaint filed last week by the CIEC, a Federal Judge in
Philadelphia Wednesday ordered the Justice Department to stop all "reviews"

panel rules on the constitutionality of the law.   The order was issued by
Judge Stewart Dalzell, one of the three judges presiding over the case.

<h3>Internet Users, Publishers, Online Service Providers, Non-Profit Groups, and Civil Liberties Advocates Fight The CDA in Court</h3>
<p>
<b>CDA is unconstitutional, Fails to Recognize Unique Nature of the Internet</b>
<P>
A coalition representing a broad spectrum of <a href = "#join">Internet users</a>, Libraries publishers, content providers and access providers filed a lawsuit on Monday February 26, 1996 in a Federal Court in Philadelphia, PA seeking to overturn the Communications Decency Act. The challenge argued that the Internet is a unique communications technology which deserves First Amendment protections at least as broad as those enjoyed as by the print medium.
<p>
The group, known as the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition (CIEC -
pronounced "seek") is coordinated by <a href = "../index.html">the Center for Democracy and
Technology</a>, America Online, and the American Library Association, and
others, including People for the American Way. Its <a href = "#members"> 
35 members</a> include libraries, book publishers, newspaper publishers, editors, <a name = "join"> advertisers, commercial online</a> service providers, ISP's, non-profit groups, and civil liberties advocates.
<p>
<HR WIDTH="50%">
<p>
<h3>Join the Fight To Protect Free Speech and the Future of the Internet!</h3>
<p>
CIEC is inviting individual Internet Users to join this landmark case to help  protect freedom of speech and the future of the Internet as a viable means of free expression, education, and commerce.
<p>
If you post messages to a public listserv, Usenet newsgroup, participate
in an IRC or chat session, or maintain your own World Wide Web page, ftp or
gopher archive, you could potentially face $250,000 fines or 2 years in jail if someone, somewhere considers the material you post to be "indecent" or "patently offensive"

<h3>The Complaint</h3>
<p>
On Monday, February 26, the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition, the 
American Library Association, America Online, Compuserve, Prodigy, Microsoft, NETCOM, The Commercial Internet eXchange, The Newspaper Association of America,  Wired Magazine, Hotwired, Families Against Internet Censorhip, and <a href = "#members">several other plaintiffs</a> filed suit in a Federal Court in Philadelphia, PA seeking to overturn the Communications Decency Act on the grounds that it is a violation of the First Amendment rights of all Internet users.
<p>
In a 73-page complaint that details the history of the Internet and
outlines how the network operates, the CIEC intended to educate the court
on how the Internet functions and why the broad content regulations imposed
by the CDA threaten the very existence of the Internet as a viable medium
for free expression, education, and commerce. Among other things, the CIEC challenge argued that:
<ul>
<li>The Internet is a unique communications medium which deserves First Amendment protections at least as broad as those afforded to print media.
<p>
<li>Individual users and Parents, not the Federal Government, should determine for themselves and their children what material comes into their homes based on their own tastes and values.
<p>
<li>The CDA will be ineffective at protecting children from "indecent" or "patently" offensive material online.
<p>
</ul>
The CIEC challenge is separate from the case brought by the ACLU, EFF,
EPIC, Planned Parenthood, and several other plaintiffs in the same
Philadelphia court on February 8, 1996.  The CIEC case
will reinforce the ACLU's efforts while focusing on the unique nature of
the Internet and alternatives to government content regulations.  On February 27, the ACLU and CIEC cases were officially consolidated.  Both the ACLU and CIEC attorneys are closely coordinating their efforts.
<p>
In order to demonstrate the nature of the Internet and the effectiveness of user empowerment technologies, CIEC arranged to wire the court room directly to the Internet.  The Center for Democracy and Technology, with the help of Bell Atlantic and Philadel

phia law firm <a href = "http://www.shsl.com">Schnader, Harrison, Segal & Lewis</a> (an amicus counsel in the case), has installed a T-1 circuit and a small local area network in the Ceremonial Room of the Philadelphia court.  To the best of our knowledge

, this was the first time in history that a Federal Courtroom has been wired to the Net for the purposes of a Trial.
<p>
The outcome of the legal challenges to the CDA will likely determine the
legal status of speech on the Internet and the future of the First

<P>

On Wednesday February 12, <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/goodlatte/" TARGET="NEW">Congressman Bob Goodlatte</A> (R-VA) reintroduced a bill to ease encryption export controls.  The bill (H.R. 695) is identical to H.R. 3011, the Security and Freedom Through Encryption (SAFE) Act, which Goodlatte championed in the last Congress.  H.R. 3011 enjoyed broad bi-partisan support, and was the subject of a September hearing
before the House Judiciary Committee.  The current Goodlatte bill, with 55 original co-sponsors, enjoys similar broad bi-partisan support.

On Wednesday, February 5, 1997, the House Telecommunications Subcommittee held a
hearing to consider cellular privacy issues. CDT Executive Director Jerry
Berman, along with FBI Assistant Director James Kallstrom, Deputy Assistant
Attorney General Robert Litt, Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association President Thomas Wheeler, and others testified before the panel.
<P>
Highlights of CDT Executive Director Jerry Berman's testimony:

<UL>
<LI>Preliminary findings of a Digital Privacy and Security Working Group (DPSWG) study of communications privacy, focusing on the effectiveness and coverage of ECPA, the implementation of CALEA, the potential of strong encryption technologies to protect privacy and security and prevent crime, and other issues. The study is being conducted at the request of Senators Arlen Specter (R-PA) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and will be completed later this year; <P>

<LI>Issues relating to the implementation of CALEA, including concerns about the FBI's latest capacity notice; and<P>

<LI>Technical solutions to privacy, including the need for encryption policy reform.
</UL>

Rep. Billy Tauzin (R-LA), the Subcommittee Chairman, spoke strongly about the need for strong privacy protections in wireless data networks, and also announced that the House Telecommunicatinos Subcommittee will hold hearings on the Encryption issue in the comming months.

<BIG><STRONG>FBI Issues Scaled Back Surveillance Capacity Notice -- Cost and Capability Issues Remain</STRONG></BIG> <FONT SIZE=-1>[Posted on January 17, 1997 | Updated on February 14, 1997]</FONT> <P>

On Tuesday January 14, 1997, the FBI issued a revised notice of proposed
surveillance capacity as required by the 1994 Communications Assistance for
Law Enforcement Act (CALEA - a.k.a. Digital Telephony).  The notice details
projected increases in law enforcement wiretapping and other electronic
surveillance activity in the coming years.
<P>
While the latest notice appears far less expansive than the FBI's first
capacity notice issued in October of 1995, and while this notice, by
including the unprecedented release of baseline surveillance information on
a county-by-county basis, goes a long way towards satisfying some of CDT's
objections to the first notice, many serious issues remain.  
<P>
The new notice is subject to a 30 day comment period, in which telephone
companies, privacy advocates and members of the public can submit comments.
Any person can submit comments, directing them to the Telecommunications
Industry Liaison Unit, FBI, P.O. Box 220450, Chantilly, VA 20153-0450.  The
Bureau has not made arrangements for on-line submissions.  Hard-copy
comments must be submitted by mail, in triplicate.

<P>
On January 14, 1997, the FBI issued a notice setting forth projected
increases in law enforcement wiretapping and other electronic
surveillance activity in coming years. Under legislation adopted
in 1994, the federal government can require telephone companies
to install additional equipment (&quot;capacity&quot;), at government
expense, to accommodate these projected increases in electronic
surveillance activity. <BR>

<P>
The narrative portion of the notice was printed in the Federal
Register. However, the very detailed appendices, which embody
the government's proposed requirements, were made available only
in hard copy to reporters in New York and at the FBI &quot;reading
room&quot; in Washington, DC. <BR>

<P>
CDT has obtained the files in electronic form and we have loaded
the entire 81 page appendix for wireline services. The appendix
has three components: <BR>

<OL>
<LI>A baseline showing the one-day peak in electronic surveillance
activity for each county in the nation during the period 1/1/93
to 3/1/95 -- that is, for each county, the total number of intercepts
that were conducted simultaneously by federal, state and local
authorities on the busiest surveillance day in the study period.
On the accompanying charts, this one day peak is the third column
of numbers. <BR>

<LI>A projection, based on past growth, of anticipated one-day
peaks of surveillance activity for each county in 1998. On the
accompanying charts, this is the first column of numbers.<BR>

<LI>A projection, based on past growth, of anticipated one-day
peaks of surveillance activity for each county in the year 2004.
On the accompanying charts, this is the middle column of numbers.
<BR>

</OL>

<P>
We have established a separate file for each state.

<P>

<FONT SIZE=4>
On January 23, 1997, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) held an open forum to
explore the issue of congestion on the Internet.  That issue is part
of a larger debate over whether Internet service providers (ISPs) and
commercial online service providers should be charged access fees for the
use of the local telephone network.  CDT along with other public interest
reprsentatives, telephone companies, ISPs, and commercial online service
providers spoke at the forum:

<LI><A HREF="http://www.internetaccess.org/" TARGET="NEW">Internet Access Coalition</A>, an organization of industry groups opposed to the imposition of access charges for the use of local telephone networks.
</UL>

The FCC bandwidth forum comes amidst an FCC inquiry on the current state of
the Internet infrastructure.  Recently, several regional bell companies
have raised concerns that Internet usage is creating significant
congestion problems on their networks, and have suggested access charges as
a solution.  Online service providers and ISP's argued that the imposition
of access charges would harm the future growth of the Net.
<P>
CDT believes this issue is critically important to the future of the
Internet, and is working to ensure that the future Internet infrastructure
develops in a way that maximizes the democratic potential of the Net and
encourages a decentralized, open architecture. In the coming months we will
be holding public forums and other education events. Please continue to

<FONT SIZE=4>In comments submitted on Wednesday (5/8) to the Federal

a request by the America's Carriers Telecommunications Association
(ACTA), an association of small long distance companies, to regulate
Internet voice telephony products and services. CDT argued that
an FCC ruling in this area would immediately restrict the ability
of Internet users to choose Internet software applications, and
would require the FCC to take &quot;... intrusive and unprecedented
steps in the regulation of ... the Internet.&quot;</FONT>

<P>
On February 3-4 and February 18-19, the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS) Subcommittee on Privacy and Confidentiality will hold public hearings to discuss the various options for implementing health information privacy standards.   The subcommittee is holding these hearings so it may develop recommendations to give to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) in preparation for an HHS report to Congress regarding privacy standards of individually identifiable health information.  This report is required by the <A HREF="/publications/pp_2.30.html">&quot;Administrative Simplification&quot;</A> subtitle of the &quot;Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996&quot; (Pub. L. 104-191, Section 264).
<P>
Issues covered at the hearing will include the full range of fair information practices, patient rights, limitations on use and disclosure of identifiable information, health identification number, preemption of state laws, and privacy-enhancing technology.
<P>
The hearings will be held on February 3-4 and February 18-19 from 9 a.m.-5 p.m. at the Hubert H. Humphrey Building (200 Independence Avenue, SW), Room 503A, Washington, D.C.  The hearings are open to the public, but seating is limited.  The public is also invited to send written comments to the subcommittee.  All comments to the subcommittee must be received by February 19th.<BR>

<P>
While S. 1360 (the Bennett-Leahy bill) remains in limbo,
Congress did take some action that impacts medical records privacy before they began the summer recess.  The 
recently-passed Kennedy-Kassebaum Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (HR 3103) contains a section known as 
&quot;Administrative Simplification.&quot;  This section of the Act mandates the
development and adoption of standards for electronic exchanges of health 
information.  It also mandates that Congress or the Secretary of Health and
Human Services develop privacy rules to govern such electronic 
exchanges; however, these rules may not be in place before the electronic 
system is implemented.

protected from compelled disclosure in court. In Jaffee v. Redmond, the
Court recognized that preserving the privilege of confidentiality in the
relationship between a therapists and patients is critical to developing
trust and thus ensuring successful treatment. Given the recent trend toward computerization of medical information, including medical health records, CDT hails the Jaffee decision as a great step in protecting the privacy of those records.

<BIG><STRONG>Mark-up of Medical Privacy Bill Postponed Indefinitely.</STRONG></BIG> <font size = -1>[May 13, 1996]</font>
<P>
The mark-up of The Medical Records Confidentiality Act (S.1360), originally scheduled for April 24, has been postponed indefinitely by the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee. The Committee has delayed action on S.1360 (also known as the Bennett-Leahy bill after its chief sponsors) to give the pharmaceutical industry and health data companies an opportunity to express their concerns about the privacy provisions in the bill. Following recommendations from CDT and other privacy and consumer groups seeking to strengthen the bill, a new version of S.1360 was drafted by Senators Nancy Kassebaum (R-KA) and Edward Kennedy (D-MA).  The new version was released April 10. (See <a href = "/publications/pp_2.14.html">CDT Policy Post 2.14 - April 12, 1996.</a>)
 <p>
CDT opposes any weakening of the current version of S.1360.  CDT has sent a letter of support for the Bennett-Leahy bill to Senators Kassebaum and Kennedy.  The letter was signed by a wide variety of consumer, privacy and patient advocates, as well as health care providers, researchers, employers, and information technology companies.

<p>
On April 24, 1996, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee will consider S. 1360, the "Medical Records Confidentiality Act".  A recently strengthened S. 1360 would create strong, comprehensive privacy safeguards for the health data of all Americans.  CDT supports the Bennett-Leahy bill and believes that its enactment would create strong, enforceable privacy protections where few currently exist.
<p>
When the bill was first introduced in October 1995, some in the privacy policy community argued that the bill did not go far enough.  CDT, along with other public interest advocates and consumer groups, recommended changes to the bill to strengthen the proposal and ensure that individuals are better able to control access to and disclosure of their private health records.  The revised bill, rewritten by Senators Nancy Kassebaum (R-KA) and Edward Kennedy (D-MA), incorporates many of the key changes recommended by CDT, the CDT-led coalition, and others in the public interest community, including Public Citizen and EPIC.

<P>
On Wednesday June 12 at 9:00 am, a panel of three federal judges in Philadelphia, PA granted the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition's (CIEC) request for a preliminary injunction against the Communications Decency Act (CDA). In a unanimous decision, the judges ruled that the CDA would unconstitutionally restrict speech on the Internet.

<STRONG>CDT Online Privacy Clearinghouse</STRONG>
<P>
To raise the public's awareness of privacy issues in the interactive age, CDT is developing a clearinghouse on privacy policies that contain the policies adopted by various entities operating on the Internet and in other interactive communications media.  Currently the Clearinghouse will allow you to examine <A HREF="online_services/chart.html">the privacy policies of the four major commercial online service providers</A>.  
<P>
In the future, CDT will be providing information on the privacy policies of a range of Internet players.  Eventually you will be able to look for a particular company or web site by name in our Policy Warehouse, or get an overview of policies within specific industries such as commerical online service providers, Internet service providers, Internet web browsers, commercial web sites, political web sites, non-profit web sites, telecommunication services, and financial services.

<BIG><STRONG>UPDATE</STRONG></BIG> <FONT SIZE=-1>[updated August 5, 1996]</FONT><P>
<H3>Safe for Now:  Senate to Vote on Revised Counter-Terrorism Bill in September</H3>
On Friday August 2, the House of Representatives passed a revised counter-terrorism bill by a margin of 389 to 22.  The bill does not contain provisions relating to encryption or expanded wiretapping authority.  
<P>
However, the Senate did not vote on the bill before they recessed for the month.  The Senate will take up consideration of the bill when Congress returns in September.  So while the current version of the bill does not contain the privacy-threatening provisions that were previously discussed, they will likely resurface when the Senate considers the bill.
<P>
In the coming days and weeks, CDT will work with Congressional leaders, privacy advocates, and the net.community to ensure that constitutional civil liberties and the openness of the Internet are protected as Congress considers counter-terrorism measures.
<P>
Thanks to everyone who called Congress to object to the new sweeping
surveillance provisions that were dropped from the bill!
