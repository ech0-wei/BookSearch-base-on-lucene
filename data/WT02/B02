<p> <b>TECHNOLOGIES FOR UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING SUBSTANCE
ABUSE AND ADDICTION </b> </p>

<p> <b>US Government Office of Technology Assessment</b> </p>

<p> October 18, 1994 </p>

<p> <b>CHAPTER 1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY </b> </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"><br>
</p>

<p> The abuse of licit and illicit drugs represents a major
public health problem in the United States. The costs to society
of such abuse include thousands of premature deaths annually due
to drug-related illnesses, accidents, and homicides; economic
costs related to health care, criminal justice, and lost
productivity; and the mental and physical pain suffered by
millions of Americans. Many ills plaguing the nation
today--including the AIDS epidemic, increased crime and violence,
and homelessness--in some cases, may be linked to individuals'
physical dependence on a variety of abusable substances. The
consequences of substance abuse and addiction have been felt by
people within every economic, social, racial, religious, and
political boundary. </p>

<p> What are the root causes of substance abuse and addiction?
Why and how does addiction occur? Who are the substance abusers?
What factors lead to addiction? What are the implications for
prevention and treatment? </p>

<hr>

<p> <b>ROOT CAUSES </b> </p>

<p> The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) was asked to
identify the root causes of substance abuse and addiction. The
term root causes has been used in political discussions and
debate. To some, root causes of substance abuse and addiction are
framed in a moral context, in which decisions related to use,
abuse, and addiction are the responsibility primarily of
individuals. To others, root causes include a multitude of social
and economic problems, such as homelessness, poverty, and racism.
Many people have strongly held opinions as to what constitutes
the general root causes of substance abuse and addiction in
populations, but no consensus exists about the specific root
causes of substance abuse and addiction for particular
individuals. </p>

<p> The OTA report has four parts: necessary preconditions,
individual factors, community contexts, and policy options. The
first part, Necessary Preconditions, focuses on several factors
that are necessary for substance abuse and addiction to occur.
The second part, Individual Factors, focuses on risk and
protective factors in individuals that are thought to influence
substance use, abuse, and addiction. The third part, Community
Contexts, looks at how risk and protective factors play out in
subcultures and in major activity settings (home, school,
workplace, and recreation). The fourth part, Policy Options
addresses a range of legislative issues and options for Congress.
</p>

<hr>

<p> <b> NECESSARY PRECONDITIONS </b> </p>

<p> No single or general set of variables explains the misuse of
alcohol and other drugs for every individual; in other words
there are no &quot;root causes&quot; for substance abuse that
universally apply to everyone. Nevertheless, OTA has identified
three major sets of necessary preconditions that must be present
in order for substance abuse and addiction to occur: </p>

<ul>
    <li>biology and pharmacology, </li>
    <li>availability, and </li>
    <li>use and transitions to abuse and dependency. </li>
</ul>

<p> <b> Biology and Pharmacology </b> </p>

<p> The first major set of preconditions includes biological and
pharmacological factors, without which drug abuse and dependency
would be impossible. Underlying all alcohol and drug problems are
the actions and effects that drugs of abuse exert on the brain.
It is important to understand how drugs work in the brain, why
certain drugs have the potential for being abused, and what, if
any, biological differences exist among individuals in their
susceptibility to abuse drugs. </p>

<p> A wide range of psychoactive substances have the potential
for abuse (see box 1-1). The possession and use of several
substances (e.g., marijuana, heroin, cocaine) are illegal in all
50 states. Other addictive substances (e.g., tobacco and alcohol)
may be legally purchased, possessed, and consumed by many
Americans. Some abusable substances (e.g., a wide range of
prescription drugs) are available on a restricted basis, usually
by a physician's order, while others (e.g., inhalants) may be
legally purchased, possessed, and consumed by anybody. </p>

<p> Biological factors that contribute to substance abuse and
addiction fall into two groups: the effects drugs of abuse exert
on the individual in general, and the biological status of
specific individuals taking drugs. The effects the drugs exert
can be either acute or chronic and will vary depending on the
drug and its route of administration. Most drugs of abuse
influence the brain's reward system. The pleasurable sensations
that drug use can produce reinforce drug-seeking and drug-taking
behaviors. These actions differ with different drugs; thus, some
substances have greater potential for abuse and addiction than
others. While growing evidence suggests that the brain reward
system plays a role in the reinforcing properties of most drugs
of abuse, the precise mechanisms involved are complex and have
yet to be completely described (see figures 1-1 and 1-2). </p>

<p> Prolonged or chronic use of a substance or substances can
produce both biological and behavioral changes (some long-
lasting). Biological changes can include sensitization and/or
tolerance to a substance and, if use is discontinued, withdrawal
(see box 1-2). Behavioral changes also occur with continued drug
use. An individual's drug-craving, drug- seeking, and drug-taking
behaviors are reinforced through neuroadaptive changes in the
brain's reward system. </p>

<p> Environmental cues also play a large role in drug-seeking and
drug-taking behavior. On encountering certain environmental
stimuli (i.e., specific locations, smells, tastes), drug-craving
and drug withdrawal symptoms have been reported by former drug
users who have been drug-free for months and even years. </p>

<p> Through family, twin, and adoption studies, most researchers
agree that genetic factors play some part in the acquisition of
alcohol problems and, although less clear, other drug problems.
However, no conclusive evidence has been found to explain
precisely what is inherited or the overall importance of this
inherited material. It has been hypothesized that numerous genes
(as opposed to one) interact in complex ways, and expression of
those genes are affected by a myriad of environmental factors.
Thus, the presence or absence of a genetic factor neither ensures
nor protects against drug addiction. </p>

<p> <b> Availability </b> </p>

<p> The second set of preconditions for drug abuse and dependency
includes availability. A person cannot become a drug abuser
unless a drug is physically available. In addition, however,
availability is affected by social norms (e.g., factors within
the community conducive to drug use, including level of parental
or guardian supervision, lack of consequences for alcohol and
drug offenses, lack of alternative activities, and portrayals of
alcohol and other drug use by friends and the media as a
glamorous and healthy activity), prices (economic availability),
and personal values (subjective availability) (see table 1-1). </p>

<p> The primary focus of U.S. antidrug policy has been to attack
the physical availability of illicit drugs through law
enforcement efforts aimed at disrupting the production,
transport, and sale of drugs. While this focus has increased
drug-related arrests--nearly half of newly sentenced federal
inmates in 1991 were imprisoned on drug charges--illicit drugs
are still widely available. </p>

<p> Marketing techniques for both licit and illicit drugs can
alter social, economic, and subjective availability. Key
components of marketing include the promotion and advertising of
particular product lines to appeal to particular subpopulations
of the consuming public, development of a product line that can
be targeted to subpopulations within the larger community of
consumers, pricing strategies to attract new buyers, and
identification of retail outlets for sales. </p>

<p> Federal law regulates the merchandising of licit yet abusable
substances such as tobacco, alcohol, and prescription drugs by
placing a variety of restrictions on how such products may be
marketed. Despite current restrictions, debate continues as to
whether and how a variety of legal drugs should be marketed. </p>

<p> <b> Use and Transitions to Abuse and Dependency </b> </p>

<p> The third set of preconditions for drug abuse and addiction
is drug use, including the progression to heavier and more
harmful use. A person cannot become drug-dependent without first
using a drug and then progressing to more harmful levels of use.
Researchers have focused on stages in the progression of drug use
in several ways. They have studied stages in the initiation of
the use of different drugs, finding a sequence that moves from
the use of cigarettes and wine or beer, to the use of marijuana,
then hard liquor, and finally other illicit drugs. Because most
individuals who use drugs do not go on to abuse drugs, and
because the use of drugs at one level does not guarantee the use
of drugs at a higher level, these stages are descriptive but not
predictive. </p>

<p> Initiation is the first step in the progression to more
serious levels of drug use. Because drug use often begins during
adolescence, most drug use research has focused on drug use
initiation among adolescents. However, many individuals who
initiate drug use do not progress to harmful drug use. Also, the
factors associated with such progression may often differ from
the factors associated with initiation. Thus, the focus on the
initiation of drug use during adolescence is not sufficient for
an understanding of the progression from use to abuse and
dependency. </p>

<p> In addition to initiation, research has focused on other
identifiable stages in the full cycle of drug use and abuse,
including continuation of drug use, maintenance and progression
of drug use within a class of drugs, progression in drug use
across drug classes, and regression, cessation, and relapse
cycles. Research has also been done on the co- occurrence and
possible sequences in drug abuse and other problem behaviors,
with some studies finding that problem behaviors often precede
the onset of drug abuse. </p>

<p> <b> INDIVIDUAL FACTORS </b> </p>

<p> Much of the research on substance abuse and addiction has
focused on identifying individual risk factors for alcohol and
other drug use, specifically among adolescents and young adults
(see table 1-2). Risk factors have been identified as those
cognitive, psychological, attitudinal, social, pharmacological,
physiological, and developmental characteristics that foster
initiation of drug and alcohol use and/or abuse by an individual.
Protective factors are those characteristics that reduce the risk
of substance use and abuse and promote positive development, such
as appropriate role models, involvement in positive peer groups,
and a positive self-image and outlook for the future. </p>

<p> Because no individual risk or protective factor can be
categorized as a root cause of substance abuse and addiction, a
full analysis of each individual factor is beyond the scope of
this report. However, an overview of selected factors highlights
associations often present in substance abuse and addiction. </p>

<p> <b> Demographic </b> </p>

<p> <b> Age </b> </p>

<p> The preponderance of substance abuse research points to the
fact that children who use alcohol and other drugs before the age
of 15 have a greater likelihood of becoming problem alcohol and
other drug users, versus those youth who begin use at a later
age. </p>

<p> While most substance use and abuse occur during the
adolescent and young-adult years, older persons are not immune to
the addictive powers of these substances. For example, among
women, alcohol problems tend to appear on average several years
later than they do among men (although this trend may be
reversing). For black males, problem drinking patterns typically
occur after age 30, versus ages 18 to 25 for white males. </p>

<p> Although substance abuse problems are not exclusive to
adolescence, most prevention programs currently target youth. The
importance of these types of programs is obvious--to prevent or
decrease the use of alcohol, tobacco, cigarettes, and other drugs
by youth. Yet, adults can also be exposed to stressful life
situations, such as unemployment, divorce, or death of a spouse
or child, which could contribute to substance abuse problems. The
adult population presents unique and often overlooked challenges
for the planning and implementation of substance abuse prevention
programs. </p>

<p> <b> Gender </b> </p>

<p> Historically, the vast majority of biological and behavioral
studies were conducted on male participants; women substance
abusers were not commonly included in research studies. A
distorted picture emerged, in which women were assumed to misuse
the same substances, and for the same reasons, as men. Within the
past 10 to 20 years, however, some researchers have focused on
the causes and consequences of substance abuse problems among
women, and are beginning to report differences based on gender.
Basic gaps in knowledge remain, however, regarding substance use
and abuse among women. Until these gaps are addressed, the
inaccurate and misleading practice of transferring data garnered
from studies on men to women is likely to continue. </p>

<p> <b> Race and Ethnicity </b> </p>

<p> Historically, racial and ethnic minorities have been linked
with, and often blamed for, many of the substance abuse problems
within the United States (see box 1-3). Certainly, many urban
areas have high concentrations of minorities, and within many of
these areas the prevalence of substance abuse may be high. Often
overlooked, however, is the prevalence of substance abuse
problems in suburban and rural areas throughout the United
States. In the minds of many, the link between minority
populations and rampant substance abuse is inaccurate and
derogatory. </p>

<p> Adolescent research has documented substantial racial and
ethnic differences in substance use among high school seniors. On
average, licit and illicit substance use is highest among Native
American Indian youth, somewhat lower among white and Hispanic
youth, substantially lower among black youth, and lowest among
Asian youth. However, such findings do not include populations
most likely to be excluded from self-reporting studies (e.g.,
high school dropouts). </p>

<p> Until recently, much of the analysis of substance use and/or
abuse data has concentrated on the relationship between the use
of a substance and one or two variables such as race and
ethnicity and/or educational level. Often a positive association
was found between minority populations and the use or abuse of
certain substances. While statistically correct, these analyses
can be simplistic and misleading. Clearly many risk and
protective factors interact to produce substance use and abuse.
If the majority of these variables are excluded from the
analysis, a skewed picture may arise as to the importance of
certain variables as risk factors for substance use and abuse.
Additionally, to simplify the data collection, racial and ethnic
categories are often broad. The most popular groupings are black,
white non- Hispanic, Hispanic, and other. While each of these
categories contains many distinct cultures, gross generalizations
are commonly made. </p>

<p> Race and ethnicity have not been shown to be either
biological or genetic risk factors for substance use or abuse. To
date, the preponderance of investigative studies has focused on
racial and ethnic differences in response specifically to
alcohol. Few studies have been completed on differences in racial
and ethnic biological responses to other licit or illicit drugs. </p>

<p> <b> Economic </b> </p>

<p> Are poor individuals at greater risk of developing problems
related to substance abuse? While a relatively straight forward
question, its resolution is hampered by the fact that poverty is
difficult to define and drawing conclusions concerning an
individual's potential for future substance abuse based on one or
two variables such as family income or educational level is
overly simplistic and deceptive. </p>

<p> In recent years, attention has been paid to the plight of the
urban poor, many of whom are minorities. These inner- city
communities are often riddled with high rates of crime, violence,
unemployment, and inadequate social and medical services. For
individuals living in these localities, the consequences of these
problems are serious and far reaching. </p>

<p> To assess poverty and its relationship to substance abuse
problems, some researchers have used the federal guidelines for
poverty, while others employ measures of socioeconomic status
(SES) such as educational level and household income. To date,
the largest and most comprehensive analysis of SES variables and
substance use has been accomplished by the National Institute on
Drug Abuse (NIDA). While the analysis revealed associations
between certain characteristics and patterns of substance use, it
did not reveal causality. From this analysis, a straightforward
&quot;yes or no&quot; response to the initial question linking
poverty to increased individual risk for substance use or abuse
is clearly impossible. The NIDA analysis demonstrated that the
type and quantity of an individual's substance use is correlated
with a variety of both individual as well as geographic
characteristics. Furthermore, while the NIDA study was the
largest and most comprehensive to date, some segments of the
population (e.g., homeless, dropouts, institutionalized), many of
whom were possible alcohol and drug abusers, were excluded from
the survey. </p>

<p> <b> Psychosocial and Behavioral </b> </p>

<p> Many of the identified risk and protective factors relate to
psychological, social, and behavioral characteristics. Conditions
such as aggressiveness, delinquency, and mental disorders are
often linked with substance abuse and addiction. Experiences such
as physical and sexual abuse have also been identified as
potential risk factors. While relatively little research has been
accomplished on protective factors, several elements identified
within the resiliency literature, as well as religiosity and
spirituality, have been associated with decreased substance use. </p>

<p> However, the presence or absence of specific risk factors
neither predicates nor guarantees protection from substance
abuse. In addition, consensus is lacking within the substance
abuse field as to the importance, interaction, or order of the
factors. </p>

<p> <b> COMMUNITY CONTEXTS </b> </p>

<p> A growing body of research is focusing on factors and
interventions relevant to the onset and prevention of substance
use, abuse, and dependency in the four principal community
activity settings--homes and families, schools and peers,
workplaces, and recreational settings. </p>

<p> In framing prevention programs with divergent populations,
researchers are attempting to better understand qualitative as
well as quantitative research methods, and the variety of
settings in which substance abuse and addiction can take place
and can be combated (see box 1-4). </p>

<p> Despite the promise of community-based research, several
problems exist. First, much of the research does not address
substance abuse and addiction per se, but rather risk and
protective factors that can lead to a number of outcomes,
including substance abuse and addiction. Second, research studies
vary widely in methodology, making it difficult to draw
scientifically valid conclusions. Third, rigorous evaluation of
many prevention research programs is missing, leaving the
effectiveness of such programs open to debate. </p>

<p> <b> Homes and Families </b> </p>

<p> Although American society expects families in their homes to
take the lead in dealing with substance abuse and other problem
behaviors, families in this country generally receive only
limited support in protecting themselves against substance abuse.
This situation may result in part from the belief that most
nuclear families can raise their children largely independently
and therefore do not need outside support, and in part from the
belief that teens and young adults are more influenced by their
peers. The first belief, however, is not supported by
long-standing practices in most societies, where extended
families and life-long neighbors have traditionally helped raise
children (although in the United States many parents do not have
access to these additional child-rearing resources because of
urbanization, high technology, and family mobility). And the
second belief is being questioned by growing evidence that
certain parenting practices and family intervention programs can
significantly reduce the risk of substance abuse among
adolescents and young adults. </p>

<p> A growing body of research has identified risk and protective
factors that may be particularly relevant in home and family
situations (see table 1-3). Programs that enhance protective
factors include those providing parent education, prenatal and
infant care, preschool, and social support activities that help
strengthen involved and responsive parenting. Programs that seek
to decrease the presence of risk factors include those designed
to reduce drug trafficking (e.g., community policing, clean
sweeps of housing projects), physical and sexual abuse, the
impact of negative life events (e.g., mental health counseling),
and parental neglect. Substance abuse treatment programs that
include an addict's family members also address risk factors. </p>

<p> <b> Schools and Peers </b> </p>

<p> Schools have been the target for prevention programs to
curtail drug use at school sites (e.g., Drug Free School Zones)
as well as curriculum-based programs that target drug use in the
community as a whole. Because school-age youth are especially
likely to initiate the use of alcohol and other drugs, much of
the research has focused on use, rather than on abuse and
dependency. Such research is nevertheless relevant to an
understanding of abuse and dependency, since use is a
precondition and contributor to abuse and dependency and because
even experimental use can be harmful. </p>

<p> OTA conducted the most extensive compilation and examination
of survey research on school-aged substance use to date-- 9,930
statistical analyses from 242 separate studies. The studies
reported statistical relationships between substance use and its
postulated causes. Statistical findings from the study reports
were sorted into 11 major categories and 50 subcategories (see
table 1-4), and then analyzed to identify strong, moderate, and
weak statistical relationships, as well as those that had been
insufficiently studied. The four variables that dominated as
correlates of and possible contributors to substance abuse are:
1) prior and concurrent use of substances, 2) substance use by
peers and friends, 3) perceived peer attitudes about substance
use, and 4) offers to use substances. The prominence of prior and
concurrent use is consistent with the reinforcing nature of
substance use itself. The prominence of the other three variables
emphasizes the importance of the social environment in
contributing to and reinforcing substance use among school- age
youth. </p>

<p> Schools primarily seek to prevent substance use and abuse
through curriculum-based drug prevention programs. Such programs
have dominated the field, largely because they are relatively
simple to understand, implement, and replicate, and because
methods to evaluate them have become standardized.
Curriculum-based prevention programs have been hampered, however,
by a lack of good evaluation data needed to prove their
effectiveness. </p>

<p> <b> Workplaces </b> </p>

<p> The prevalence of drug abuse among the employed remains
inadequately documented, based on a small number of studies.
Substance abuse contributes to workplace problems, such as
accidents, injuries, absenteeism, turnover, lost productivity,
compensation claims, and insurance costs. Substance abuse in
workplaces can be affected by nonworkplace factors and workplace
factors. The primary interventions are employee assistance
programs that help employees with personal problems by providing
services directly (through the work organization) or indirectly
(through a provider in the community); health promotion programs
that typically seek to prevent illness and promote wellness
through behavior change; and alterations to workplace
environments that seek to reduce stress and strengthen support
for workers. </p>

<p> <b> Recreational Settings </b> </p>

<p> Recreational activities and settings may also contribute to
the prevention of substance use and abuse or, by their absence,
increase the risk. Examples of recreational activities and
settings include Boys and Girls Clubs, Boy and Girl Scouts,
organized sports, and local park and recreation department
programs. </p>

<p> Research on the impact of organized youth activities on
substance use and abuse is limited, and only a few studies have
addressed the issue directly. However, existing research
indicates that involvement in youth programs and activities is
associated with fewer at-risk behaviors, including substance use
among youth. The youth development field, including the resources
of park and recreation departments, provides opportunities for
broad-based prevention interventions. </p>

<p> Involvement in activities does not by itself protect against
substance abuse. Some activities, such as those that are
unstructured and unsupervised, may even increase the risks of
substance use and abuse through association with a wider range of
peers, some of whom are using substances. In addition, activities
perceived as boring may not protect against substance use and
abuse. More research is needed to clarify the aspects of
recreational and other leisure activities that may protect
against substance use and abuse. Research might focus on whether
activities that are supervised, structured, drug-free,
empowering, skills- building, self-esteem-promoting, active,
shared, and nonboring (or some combination of those) are
associated with lower levels of substance use and abuse. </p>

<hr>

<p> <b> POLICY OPTIONS </b> </p>

<p> Issues related to substance abuse and addiction have long
occupied the attention of the American public (see table 1- 5).
Congress has authorized a multitude of federal programs aimed at
reducing or preventing the supply and demand of illicit drugs and
regulating the availability of illicit substances, and has
appropriated billions of dollars each year to federal agencies,
provided oversight of federal programs, and passed broad-based
legislation to coordinate programs as part of the war on drugs.
In addressing what some policymakers term as the root causes of
substance abuse and addiction, the list of relevant statutes
expands significantly, as many domestic and social programs can
influence the risk and protective factors that can lead an
individual into or away from substance abuse and addiction. </p>

<p> A total of 12 executive branch departments, four independent
agencies, one multiagency program (Weed and Seed), one White
House office (the Office of National Drug Control Policy--
ONDCP), and the Judiciary, all receive federal funding as part of
national drug control strategy. These efforts include
interdiction, treatment, and prevention programs. </p>

<p> The federal substance abuse control policy has as its primary
focus the eradication of the supply of drugs. Congress currently
appropriates more than $12 billion annually on antidrug efforts,
with approximately two-thirds of this amount supporting drug
interdiction and law enforcement activities, and the remainder
supporting demand- side activities, such as drug treatment,
research, and prevention programs. </p>

<p> Drug demand reduction efforts focus on providing treatment
for abusers and addicts, prevention programs for various
populations, and biomedical and behavioral research on the causes
of substance use, abuse, and addiction. Of these, the federal
government spends the most on treatment, followed by prevention
and causality research. Drug treatment and prevention programs
are funded at both the federal and state levels, while causation
research is funded primarily by the federal government. A recent
General Accounting Office (GAO) study revealed that for studying
the causes of drug abuse, funding has remained comparatively
tiny. In 1990, for example, such research was funded at a level
of $6 million, about one-tenth of one percent of the nation's
drug control budget for that year. </p>

<p> OTA, in conjunction with GAO, surveyed federal agencies
identified as having substance abuse prevention efforts. OTA
finds that substance abuse prevention efforts are scattered over
a number of federal agencies, and that federal prevention efforts
are dictated by statutory mandates, rather than directed at
identifying causes of substance abuse and addiction per se. The
White House ONDCP, charged with coordinating federal antidrug
efforts, lacks the statutory mandate to forcibly integrate or
alter the multitude of programs that make up the federal
government's war on drugs. </p>

<p> Congress faces several fundamental difficulties in addressing
the causes of substance abuse and addiction: </p>

<ul>
    <li> o No scientific consensus exists as to what is the
        driving cause of substance abuse and addiction. A range
        of risk and protective factors have been associated with
        drug use, abuse, and addiction. </li>
    <li> o Federal antidrug efforts, though coordinated by ONDCP,
        are spread among many federal agencies, whose
        authorization and appropriations fall under the
        jurisdiction of numerous congressional committees and
        subcommittees. ONDCP efforts in drug demand reduction
        efforts alone involved federal agencies across at least
        11 Cabinet-level departments. This makes coordinated
        legislative action difficult to achieve. </li>
    <li> o The federal budget deficit is an obstacle to the
        creation of new domestic programs or the enhancement of
        existing programs that target known risk and protective
        factors in individuals and communities. The framework and
        literature reviews presented in this report make clear
        that substance abuse and addiction can arise and be
        influenced by multiple factors in individuals, groups,
        and communities. Thus, effective intervention requires
        prevention practitioners to select from a variety of
        options, so they can target the specific factors that are
        especially important for the particular populations and
        communities they are addressing. This does not mean that
        everything must be done at once nor that everything be
        known in advance of taking action. To the contrary,
        policymakers and practitioners can take small steps at a
        time, and then, as resources and new knowledge permit,
        take additional steps that address a fuller range of
        factors and contexts in greater depth. </li>
    <li> o Current drug prevention programs lack scientifically
        accepted standards for determining their success or
        failure. Whatever methods are developed, tested, and
        incorporated into prevention programs, a critical
        component of success is careful, rigorous evaluation.
        Answering &quot;what works?&quot; is essential in making
        advances in preventing substance abuse. </li>
</ul>

<p> In choosing which policy issues to address, OTA focused on
those areas directly addressed in this study. OTA identified a
series of policy issues in four broad categories: federal focus
and prevention program structure, research needs, community
activity settings, and availability (see table 1- 6). A number of
policy questions and options for congressional action emerge from
these four categories (see table 1-7). A full discussion of the
policy issues and options for congressional action can be found
in chapter 9 of the full report. Given the broad nature of
federal antidrug efforts, many important issues relating to
federal antidrug efforts remain beyond the scope of this report.
Such topics include drug treatment, interdiction and enforcement,
and drug legalization. </p>

<p> BOX 1-1: Overview of Alcohol and Some Other Psychoactive
Substances </p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> <b> ALCOHOL (ethyl alcohol) </b> </p>

<p> Alcohol, one of the most widely used of all drugs, is a
central nervous system depressant with effects similar to those
of sedative-hypnotic compounds (see below). At low doses, alcohol
may be associated with behavioral excitation thought to be due to
the depression of inhibitory neurons in the brain. Alcohol
differs from sedative-hypnotic compounds in that it is used
primarily for recreation or social rather than medical purposes. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Beer. 2. Wine. 3. &quot;Hard&quot; liquor (e.g., whiskey,
gin). </p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> <b> SEDATIVES, HYPNOTICS, OR ANXIOLYTICS </b> </p>

<p> Sedative-hypnotics are drugs of diverse chemical structure
that exert a nonselective general depressant on the central
nervous system. In addition, they reduce metabolism in a variety
of tissues in the body, depressing any system that uses energy.
Depending on the dose, any sedative hypnotic compound may be
classified as a sedative (an agent that allays excitement), a
tranquilizer (an antianxiety agent), a hypnotic (a sleep-inducing
agent), or an anesthetic (an agent that eliminates pain).
Sedative-hypnotics are used medically as sedatives, anxiolytics
(antianxiety agents), hypnotics, antiepileptics, muscle
relaxants, and general anesthetics. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Barbiturates (&quot;downers&quot; or &quot;barbs&quot;):
pentobarbital sodium[NembutalR], secobarbital sodium [SeconalR],
amobarbital [AmytalR]--taken orally. </p>

<p> 2. Nonbarbiturate hypnotics: methaqualone [QuaaludesR]--
taken orally. </p>

<p> 3. Tranquilizers: diazepam [ValiumR], chlordiazepoxide
hydrochloride [LibriumR]--taken orally. </p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> <b> CANNABIS (THC) </b> </p>

<p> THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) the active agent in marijuana,
alters perceptions, concentration, emotions, and behavior, though
the mechanisms of action are not entirely clear. Researchers have
found, however, that THC changes the way in which sensory
information is processed by the brain. It can be used medically
to relieve nausea and side effects of chemotherapy in cancer
patients; it is very rarely used to treat glaucoma. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Marijuana (&quot;pot&quot; or &quot;grass&quot;)-- smoked
or eaten. 2. Hashish (&quot;hash&quot;)--smoked or eaten. 3.
Hashish oil (&quot;hash oil&quot;)--smoked (mixed with tobacco.
4. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-- taken orally in capsules. </p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> <b> NICOTINE </b> </p>

<p> Nicotine, obtained naturally from tobacco, is a central
nervous system stimulant.(c) It exerts its action secondary to
stimulation of certain cholinergic (excitatory) synapses both
within the brain and in the peripheral nervous system. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Cigarettes. 2. Smokeless tobacco (e.g., snuff or chewing
tobacco). </p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> <b> COCAINE </b> </p>

<p> Cocaine, obtained naturally from coca leaves, is a potent
central nervous system stimulant.(c) It stimulates the
sympathetic nervous system, which regulates the activity of
cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, and glands. It also produces
bronchodilation in the lungs. It is used medically as a topical
anesthetic for surgical procedures. </p>

<p> </p>

<p> <b> Examples </b> </p>

<p> 1. Cocaine hydrochloride powder (&quot;coke&quot; or
&quot;street cocaine&quot;)--usually snorted or injected
intravenously.(d) </p>

<p> 2. Cocaine alkaloid (&quot;freebase&quot; or
&quot;crack&quot;)--smoked.(e) </p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> AMPHETAMINES AND RELATED STIMULANTS(f) </p>

<p> 1. Amphetamines </p>

<p> Amphetamines are a group of three closely related compounds,
all of which are potent central nervous system and behavioral
stimulants.(c) Some amphetamines are used medically to treat
attention deficit disorder or minimal brain dysfunction in
children, narcolepsy (recurrent, uncontrollable, brief episodes
of sleep), or (rarely) depression. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Amphetamine (&quot;speed&quot; or &quot;uppers&quot;
(BenzedrineR]--taken orally, injected, or snorted.(g) </p>

<p> 2. Methamphetamine (&quot;speed&quot; or &quot;crystal
meth&quot; or &quot;ice&quot;) [MethadrineR]--taken orally,
injected, or snorted.(g),(h) </p>

<p> 3. Dextroamphetamine [DexedrineR]--taken orally, or injected.
</p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> 2. Nonamphetamine stimulants </p>

<p> Like amphetamines, nonamphetamine stimulates are central
nervous and behavioral stimulants. Some non-amphetamine
stimulants (e.g., PreludinR) are used for weight control, and
some (e.g., RitalinR and CylertR) are used medically to treat
hyperactivity, minimal brain dysfunction, narcolepsy, or (rarely)
depression. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Pheumetrazine hydrochloride [PreludinR]--taken orally or
injected.(d) </p>

<p> 2. Methylphenidate hydrochloride injected.(d) </p>

<p> 3. Pemoline [CylertR]--taken orally. [RitalinR]--taken
orally, or injected.(d) </p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> <b> HALLUCINOGENS </b> </p>

<p> Hallucinogens, or psychedelics, are a heterogeneous group of
compounds that affect a person's perceptions, sensations,
thinking, self-awareness, and emotions.(i) </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) or
&quot;acid&quot;--taken orally or put in the eyes. </p>

<p> 2. Mescaline (3,4,5-trimethylox- phenylethyl amide) or
&quot;mesc&quot; and peyote--disks chewed, swallowed, or smoked;
tablets taken orally. </p>

<p> 3. Psilocybin (&quot;magic mushrooms&quot;)--chewed and
swallowed. 4. MDMA (methylene dioxymethamphetamine)--taken
orally. </p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> <b> INHALANTS </b> </p>

<p> Inhalants are chemicals that produce psychoactive vapors.
Although different in makeup, nearly all of the abused inhalants
produce effects similar to those of anesthetics, which act to
slow down the body's functions or produce feelings of dizziness.
At low doses, users may feel slightly stimulated. Amyl nitrite is
used for heart patients because it dilates the blood vessels and
increases blood supply to the heart. There are no medical
indications for most of the inhalants. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Solvents (model airplane glue, nail polish remover,
lighter and cleaning fluids, and gasoline)--vapors inhaled. </p>

<p> 2. Aerosols (e.g., paints, hairsprays)--vapors inhaled. </p>

<p> 3. Some anesthetics (e.g.,nitrous oxide)--vapors inhaled. </p>

<p> 4. Amyl nitrite (&quot;snappers&quot; or &quot;poppers&quot;)
and butyl nitrite (&quot;rush&quot;)--vapors inhaled. </p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> <b> OPIATES (NARCOTICS) AND RELATED ANALGESICS </b> </p>

<p> Opiates are natural or synthetic drugs that, like morphine, a
substance derived from the opium poppy, have analgesic
(pain-relieving) properties. Heroin is not approved for medical
uses in the United States. The major medical use of other opiates
is for the relief of pain (i.e., as analgesics); some narcotics
are used to relieve coughing (i.e., as antitussives) or to treat
diarrhea. Methadone is used in the treatment of narcotic
abstinence syndromes and as an analgesic in terminal illness. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Heroin (&quot;smack&quot; or &quot;horse&quot;)--
injected, smoked, or inhaled.(d) </p>

<p> 2. Codeine (codeine sulfate)--taken orally or injected.(d) 3.
Morphine (morphine hydrochloride)--injected, smoked, or inhaled. </p>

<p> 4. Synthetic opiates (e.g., methadone [DolophineR]);
hydromorphone hydrochloride [DilaudidR], meperidine hydrochloride
[DemerolR], oxycodone and asprin [PercodanR]-- taken orally or
injected. </p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> <b> PCP (PHENCYCLIDINE) AND SIMILARLY ACTING
SYMPHATHOMIMETICS </b> </p>

<p> Phencycyclidine, commonly referred to as PCP, alters the
functions of the neocortex and has been called a dissociative
anesthetic. It was developed in the 1950s as an anesthetic but
was subsequently taken off the market in 1967 when it was
discovered that the drug caused hallucinations in some people.(j)
PCP is now used legally only in veterinary medicine as an
immobilizing agent. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> PCP (&quot;angel dust&quot; or &quot;lovely&quot;)--taken
orally, or smoked (sprayed on joints or cigarettes).(d) </p>

<p> (a) According to Julien, one could conceivably classify
psychoactive drugs by at least three methods: 1) mechanism of
action, 2) chemical structure, and 3) behavioral effects.
Probably the most useful approach would be to classify them by
mechanism of action, but knowledge of the brain's physiology is
too limited for this approach to be comprehensive. A limitation
of the second approach is that many drugs of apparently similar
structure exert quite different effects, and many drugs of
dissimilar structure exert quite similar effects. The
classification in this table largely reflects the behavioral
effects approach. The classification used here is based on the
categories in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd ed., revised.
According to the American Psychiatric Association, all of the
classes of psychoactive substances listed in this box except
nicotine are associated with both abuse and dependence. Nicotine
is associated with dependence but not abuse. </p>

<p> (b) The potential physiological, psychological, and
behavioral effects of using the psychoactive substance shown are
discussed in the sources listed below. The consequences depend in
part on the specific drug used, the dosage level and mode of
administration. </p>

<p> (c) Central nervous system stimulants are drugs that can
elevate mood, increase alertness, reduce fatigue, provide a sense
of increased energy, decrease appetite, and improve task
performance. They can also produce anxiety, insomnia, and
irritability. The drugs differ widely in their molecular
structures and mechanisms of action. </p>

<p> (d) According to the American Psychiatric Association, the
route of administration of a psychoactive substance is an
important variable in determining whether use will lead to
dependence or abuse. In general, routes of administration that
produce more efficient absorption of the substance in the blood
stream (e.g., intravenous injection) tend to increase the
likelihood of an escalating pattern of substance uses that leads
to dependence. Routes that quickly deliver psychoactive
substances to the brain (e.g., smoking or intravenous injection)
are associated with higher levels of consumption and with an
increased likelihood of toxic effects. Use of contaminated
needles for intravenous administration of amphetamines, cocaine,
and opiates can cause hepatitis, HIV infection, and other
illnesses. </p>

<p> (e) Freebase cocaine is a form of cocaine made by converting
&quot;street cocaine&quot; (cocaine hydrochloride) to a purified
base that is smoked. The effect of smoking freebase is similar to
that of intravenous injection but smoking provides a shorter more
intense high than sniffing or ingestion because of the rapid
absorption of the drug through the lungs. &quot;Crack
cocaine&quot; is the street name given to freebase cocaine that
has been processed from cocaine hydrochloride to a chemical base
by cooking it with baking soda and water. The term crack refers
to the cracking sound that is heard when the mixture is smoked
(heated), presumably due to the sodium bicarbonate. </p>

<p> (f) Describing a drug as a stimulant does not adequately
describe its properties. Drug use surveys typically mean
amphetamines when they use the word stimulants. Some surveys
regard as stimulants both prescription (amphetamines) and
nonprescription substances (e.g., caffeine-based compounds used
in No-Doz, diet pills, and &quot;fake pep pills&quot;). Cocaine
and nicotine (described above) are also central nervous system
simulants. </p>

<p> (g) According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
designer drugs are structural analogs of substances scheduled
under the Controlled Substances Act that are prepared by
underground chemists to mimic the psychoactive effects of
controlled substances or produce other psychoactive effects.
Because such analogs are not identical to their parent compound,
their manufacture and distribution does not violate the law. As
of June 1986, there were synthetic analogs of PCP, fentanyl and
meperidine, and amphetamine and methamphetamine. </p>

<p> (h) In the past, abuse of methamphetamine had been in the
form of tablets or intravenous injection. More recently,
&quot;ice&quot; (one of the common street names for
d-methamphetamine hydrochloride) has gained popularity in a form
suitable for smoking. </p>

<p> (i) Most of the agents in this class of drugs can induce
hallucinations if the dose is high enough. But the term
hallucinogen does not adequately describe the range of
pharmacological actions of the diverse group of substances
usually included in the class. The term psychedelic was proposed
by Osmond in 1957 to imply that these agents all have the ability
to alter the sensory perception and thus may be considered
&quot;mind expanding.&quot; The effects of hallucinogens are
unpredictable and depend on the amount taken, the user's
personality, mood and expectations, and the surroundings in which
the drug is used. </p>

<p> (j) PCP is considered a hallucinogen in some surveys of drug
use. </p>

<p> BOX 1-2: Tolerance, Sensitization, Dependence, and Withdrawal
</p>

<p> Tolerance to a drug develops when, following a prolonged
period of use, more of the drug is required to produce a given
effect. Sensitization, the opposite of tolerance, occurs when the
effects of a given dose of a drug increase after repeated
administration. Dependence is a type of neuroadaptation to drug
exposure. With prolonged use of a drug, cells in the brain adapt
to its presence such that the drug is required to maintain normal
cell function. On abrupt withdrawal of the drug, the cell behaves
abnormally and a withdrawal syndrome ensues. Generally, the
withdrawal syndrome is characterized by a series of signs and
symptoms that are opposite to those of the drug's acute effects.
For example, withdrawal of sedative drugs produce excitation and
irritability. Conversely, withdrawal of stimulants produces
profound depression. </p>

<p> BOX 1-3: Drugs and Discrimination </p>

<p> In America, tensions between the majority and various
minorities often hinge on concerns raised by drug use. The groups
change over time and place, but the dividing issues remain
remarkably similar. Those in power decide which drugs are legal
and how rules should be enforced. Minorities charge that unfair
policies result from prejudice, ignorance, and hypocrisy. </p>

<p> When? 1850 Where? Boston Who? Irish Immigrants </p>

<p> Impoverished Irish immigrants brought the tradition of
drinking whiskey with them. In American cities, people often
blamed whiskey for neighborhood quarrels. In the mid-19th
century, clashes with Irish immigrants occurred so often that
police vans came to be known by the term &quot;paddy
wagons.&quot; </p>

<p> When? 1880s Where? San Francisco Who? Chinese Immigrants </p>

<p> Fear of immigrant Chinese often focused on their recreational
use of opium. In 1875, San Francisco outlawed opium smoking,
which most residents associated exclusively with the Chinese.
This citywide ban became nationwide in 1909. </p>

<p> When? 1882 Where? Ohio Who? German Immigrants </p>

<p> Beer drinking often brought Germans into conflict with
temperance advocates. Cincinnati's lively German community
gathered at beer gardens on Sundays to sing, dance, drink, and
argue politics. In 1882, Ohio's governor denounced Germans as
&quot;sabbath breakers, criminals, and free thinkers.&quot; </p>

<p> When? 1930s Where? Colorado, New Mexico Who? Mexican Migrant
Workers </p>

<p> The Southwest welcomed Mexican migrants during labor
shortages. But during the Depression, anxiety over competition
for jobs shifted to wildly exaggerated fears of the effects of
marijuana use customary among Mexicans. To placate fears,
Congress passed the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937, which prohibited
recreational use of the drug. </p>

<p> When? 1991 Who? African Americans Police forces are largely
white and inner-city residents are mostly black. Between 1980 and
1990, the drug-arrest rate in the city of Rochester, New York,
was about five times that for suburban Monroe County. </p>

<p> BOX 1-4: Ethnography </p>

<p> Ethnographic techniques allow researchers to study how
environmental and cultural factors affect values, attitudes, and
behaviors of individuals and groups. For three decades,
researchers have documented societal and cultural influences on
the patterns of substance use, abuse, and addiction; using a
range of methodologies and working in diverse contexts,
ethnographers have contributed to the understanding of substance
abuse. Interacting with drug users under a wider set of
circumstances than do strict quantitative researchers,
ethnographers have expanded the framework of substance abuse
research hypotheses. They have also assisted in the evaluation
and interpretation of clinical and survey data to different
subcultures and populations. </p>

<p> Ethnographies also provide information on constantlychanging
substance use patterns. By collecting data from substance users
in their natural environments, ethnographers have been able to
document who uses drugs and how drugs are used. This type of
methodology is essential to the historical understanding of
substance use and abuse. </p>

<p> Lastly, ethnographers have documented different styles of
substance use within American society as well as abroad.
Differences are cited in experience and use patterns based on
social class, cultural background, gender, and geographic
location. </p>

</p>

<p>IX. MARIJUANA LEGISLATION CLASHES WITH JUDICIAL SKEPTICISM AND
EMERGING VALUES - PIECEMEAL JUDICIAL RESPONSE: 1965-1970<br>
</p>

<p>The dramatic increase in marijuana use during the latter
1960's and the consequent increase in prosecution1 were matters
of high public visibility. Judicial response at both the trial
and appellate levels was influenced by a combination of powerful
forces, none of which had been present in the preceding years.
The 1960's saw a revolution in the law of criminal procedure, and
in few areas were police practices more suspect than in the
enforcement of the drug laws. The latter part of the decade
witnessed widespread dissent against the political and legal
systems; this protest milieu gave an added dimension to marijuana
use as more and more people smoked, oftentimes overtly, in order
to defy a seemingly ignorant law. Faced with this unusual
conjunction of widespread political and social eccentricity, the
courts-institutional protectors of political deviants-were
inevitably pressed into institutional sympathy for social
deviants. A third force was the revitalized judicial interest in
the value of privacy in a highly automated, technological
society; more and more people went to the courts to question
longstanding governmental prohibitions against essentially
private decisions and acts-homosexuality, abortion, contraception
and drugs. Together with the well-publicized medical skepticism
about the soundness of the nation's drug laws, particularly those
regulating marijuana, these forces moved the courts to scrutinize
enforcement practices and consider a new wave of constitutional
objections to state and federal marijuana legislation.<br>
</p>

<h2>A. Multiple Offenses: Untying the Statutory Knots</h2>

<h3>1. Federal Developments<br>
</h3>

<p>In the major decision during this period, the United States
Supreme Court voided the federal provisions most often employed
to prosecute the possessor (buyer) of marijuana. In the first arm
of Leary v. United States,2 the Court held that the Fifth
Amendment relieves unregistered buyers of any duty to pay the
transfer tax and to file the written order form as required by
the Marihuana Tax Act.3 The Court reasoned that, since filing
such a form would expose a buyer to liability under state law,
under the occupational tax provisions of the Tax Act, and perhaps
under the marijuana provision of the Import and Export Act,4 the
filing provisions violated the fifth amendment guarantees against
self-incrimination. On the other hand, the Court held in a later
case that the fifth amendment does not relieve the marijuana
seller of the duty to confine his sales to transferees who are
willing to comply with the order form requirements.5 Similarly,
the Eighth Circuit recently held6 that Leary does not compel
invalidation of Tax Act section 4755(b), which prohibits the
interstate transportation of marijuana, because a conviction
under that section is not really a conviction for falling to
register and pay the occupational tax and, even if it were,
registration under section 4753 is not necessarily incriminating
as was the written order form requirement struck down in Leary .7
</p>

<p>The second arm of Leary reversed the long line of decisions8
upholding the presumption of knowing concealment of illegal
importation arising from possession under section 176a of the
Import and Export Act.9 The Court held that, in light of the case
with which marijuana was domestically cultivated and the number
of users, the presumption of know1edge could not rationally be
drawn from possession.10 it could not be said &quot;with
substantial assurance that the presumed fact [knowing concealment
of illegally imported marijuana] is more likely than not to flow
from the proved fact [possession] on which it is made to
depend.&quot;11 Although there is authority to the contrary,12
the Ninth Circuit has held this part of Leary retroactive,
thereby invalidating all prior Section 176a convictions in which
the defendant did not admit knowledge and the was instructed as
to the applicability of the statutory presumption .13 </p>

<p>A serious dispute remains as to what the Government will have
to prove in subsequent prosecutions under section 176a. Assuming
that the entire provision does not violate the privilege against
self-incrimination,14 it is likely that the prosecution will have
to prove actual knowledge of illegal importation in the future.15
Since it is highly improbable that such proof will be
forthcoming, section 176a has probably been rendered useless as
applied to possessors. It should be clear that the entire series
of decisions under the Tax Act and section 176a has an air of
unreality about them because Congress probably has Article I
power directly to prohibit possession and sale of marijuana and
has now exercised that power in the Comprehensive Drug Abuse
Prevention and Control Act of 1970.16 This new legislation,
although stopping short in some respects, discards many of the
fictions perpetuated by earlier legislation. The Leary decision
was at least partially responsible for forcing Congress to
rationalize the federal role in the drug field, particularly with
respect to marijuana. </p>

<p>Another manifestation of judicial dissatisfaction with the
extreme nature of existing drug legislation is the apparent
reversal of the trend of decisions upholding the strict liability
of one-time drug offenders, users and addicts for failure to
register when leaving the country.17 The Ninth Circuit held the
phrase &quot;uses narcotic drugs&quot; unconstitutionally
vague.18 Taking a more direct approach, the Second Circuit found
knowledge of the registration requirement to be an element of the
crime.19 Thus construed, the statute precludes any due process
challenge to the sufficiency of the notice.20 Although a
self-incrimination issue remains, 21 the Second Circuit's
decision removed the most serious defect in the statute, one that
had become intolerable as the number of marijuana convictions
escalated in the late 1960's.<br>
</p>

<h3>2. State Developments<br>
</h3>

<p>The erosion of the archaic federal criminal statutes for
marijuana-related offenses has been accompanied by a similar,
albeit limited, development on the state level. The major issue
in state litigation concerns so-called &quot;drug-proximity&quot;
offenses which are generally employed as plea-bargaining tools or
to prevent the release of a suspect when evidence was 1 illegally
seized or when the evidence is insufficient to secure a
conviction under the substantive drug offense. Typical ancillary
offenses are loitering in the common areas of a building for the
purpose of unlawfully using or possessing any narcotic drug;22
loitering in public by a user, addict or convicted drug offender
without lawful employment;23 presence in an establishment where
narcotic drugs are dispensed;24 and presence of a user or drug
offender in a private place where drugs are kept.25 </p>

<p>The decisional trend seems to point to the unconstitutional
vagueness of simple loitering and vagrancy statutes.26 Because of
the nexus between narcotics and crime, however, the courts are
struggling to redefine narcotics-proximity statutes to avoid the
vagueness objection.27 It might appear that where &quot;good
account&quot; provisions give the arresting police officer too
much discretion the statute will fal1.28 On the other hand,
courts generally avoid vagueness objections based on lack of
notice by reading in knowledge elements wherever neccssary.29
Because of the tenuous relation between marijuana and crime, the
courts should construe &quot;narcotics&quot; in such statutes not
to include marijuana. </p>

<p>Similar restriction of marijuana-related offenses has been
accomplished by holding that charges of possession and sale will
not both lie where the only possession is incident to sale,30 and
by tightening the requirements of specificity in the indictment
regarding the proscribed parts of the plant.31 </p>

<h2>B. Procedural Objections to Enforcement Practices<br>
</h2>

<p>The law of criminal procedure underwent a major revolution in
the 1960's. The Bill of Rights was applied piece by piece to the
states through the fourteenth amendment. The Supreme Court
focused its concern on protecting the rights of the criminal
defendant. The earlier philosophy had been that, so long as the
defendant's rights at trial were guaranteed, the Court should
not, and did not need to, intrude into the pretrial stages of the
criminal process. For a variety of reasons it became clear in the
1960's that in a system where between 75 and 90 percent of all
defendants bargain and enter guilty pleas, rights must be assured
well before trial if they are to have any real meaning to the
average person caught in the net of the criminal process. Thus,
step by step the Court began to regulate police practices-search,
arrest and interrogation techniques-and the conduct of the early
stages of the criminal process. This substantial change in
attitude meant that more marijuana defendants could successfully
raise procedural objections.<br>
</p>

<h3>1. Search and Seizure<br>
</h3>

<p>The most important development for the marijuana offender has
been the close judicial scrutiny of police searches as a result
of Supreme Court rulings under the fourth amendment. More
stringent standards have been established for the police to
obtain search warrants32 and the proper scope of searches
incident to a lawful arrest has been narrowed substantially. 33 </p>

<p>Although courts have refused to exclude any evidence that was
in plain sight when seized, such as a bag of marijuana in a
school satchel voluntarily opened by a student,34 or marijuana
thrown out of window by a defendant trying to dispose of it,35
they have narrowed the permissible time and area in which a car
may be searched .36 </p>

<p>Moreover, the difficult standing problem posed by the
requirement that one had to admit possession or ownership of the
seized property in order successfully to challenge the search was
alleviated in cases involving group arrests by permitting all
those on the premises to challenge a given search.37 </p>

<p>The new requirements for procuring search warrants led to a
number of technical defense victories. For example, searches of
defendants' residences were successfully challenged in two
Montana marijuana cases38 because the warrants were issued by a
justice of the peace, rather than by a district judge, as
required by the state law. These holdings were premised on the
sanctity of private residences, and they suggest a growing
reluctance to countenance &quot;reasonable&quot; warrantless
searches, especially of the home. Similarly, Maryland struck down
the fruits of a search of defendant's guests and their
automobiles on the ground that the permissible search was limited
to the areas described in the warrant.39 An Illinois court has
held that property not included in the warrant must be returned
to the defendant.40 This return to a more stringent view of
particularity requirements of warrants stands in stark contrast
to the willingness of courts to overlook these requirements in
the late fifties.41 </p>

<p>Likewise, courts now scrutinize more closely police claims of
probable cause for expanding the area of the search. A California
court held that even though defendant was lawfully arrested,
search of his luggage in a friend's apartment was justified
neither by the friend's consent nor by the officer's having seen
the defendant swallow something.42 The search was especially
unjustifiable since the defendant had been arrested in his
automobile. In another California case, the presence of peculiar
odors did not constitute probable cause for the search of a
footlocker.43 </p>

<p>An airline had detained the footlocker since it corresponded
to a police description. The officers had smelled the marijuana
and then searched the footlocker before sending it on its way and
tracing it. The California Supreme Court held that the smell
alone was not sufficient cause to search without a warrant. </p>

<p>Despite judicial narrowing of the scope of searches with or
without a warrant, the easing of the standing requirements, and
the closer scrutiny on the probable cause issue, courts continue
to permit police to enter dwellings without knocking or by force
where circumstances indicate such action is reasonable and
necessary. For example, a California court upheld a marijuana
search, even though the police entered without knocking, because
the police heard people running around inside yelling, &quot;It's
the police,&quot; and thought they heard a shot fired.44 The
court held that the statutory knocking requirement was subject to
exception when there was danger of destruction of evidence and
danger to the police. Closely related to no-knock entry is
forcible entry, upheld in an Illinois case45 where the police
broke into the defendant's residence when he did not immediately
respond to their knocks. The necessity for forced entry is
essentially the same as for unannounced entry, but forced entry
adds the danger of causing fright and damage. </p>

<p>Another search area that has not been substantially
liberalized is that of the border search. Customs officials have
a much more extensive right to search than their police
colleagues. Mere suspicion is sufficient to justify a border
search.46 Even though the jurisdiction of customs agents ends
once entry into the country is completed,, the courts have
allowed border guards great discretion in determining what
constitutes completed entry. In Thomas v. United States.47 the
Fifth Circuit held admissible evidence seized an hour and a half
after the appellant had entered the United States because he was
only six blocks from the border. Although there is an inevitable
problem of how far the jurisdiction of the customs agent extends,
Thomas suggests c1early that it is not limited to border
crossings. <br>
</p>

<h3>2. Entrapment</h3>

<p>Although the majority opinions in Sorrells v. United States48
and Sherman v. United States,49 remain the leading statements on
entrapment, some courts have recently permitted expansion of the
defense. In California a defendant may plead not guilty and still
raise the entrapment defense in some cases. The court in People
v. Perez stated: </p>

<p>To compel a defendant to admit his guilt as a condition of
invoking the defense of entrapment would compel him to relieve
the prosecution of its burden of proving his guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt at the risk of not being able to meet his burden
of proving entrapment.50 </p>

<p>The defendant must, however, still raise the defense at trial
to be determined as a matter of fact by the jury.51 There is no
right to raise the defense in a pretrial motion to suppress the
evidence.52 Most courts continue to focus on the moral
culpability of the accused53 in determining whether or not
entrapment has been successfully shown. Recent Arkansas,54 and
Nevada55 cases, however, suggest that the courts are increasingly
concerned about the conduct of law enforcement agents, especially
in marijuana cases.<br>
</p>

<h3>3. Other Prosecution Practices</h3>

<p>Several major abuses, although judicially recognized, remain
largely uncorrected. Long delay between offense and arrest is
common in narcotics offenses because the police desire to expose
the full extent of distribution and to maintain a cover for the
undercover agent as long as possible. Yet any substantial delay
prejudices the defendant since the prosecution continues to
gather evidence while the defendant may forget exact
circumstances and possibly exculpating facts. Judicial response
has been inconsistent, focusing primarily on the purposefulness
of the delay.56 In light of the recent rejuvenation of the speedy
trial requirement by the Supreme Court,57 there is some hope that
this abuse may be corrected. </p>

<p>A more serious abuse with which state and federal prosecutors
have been charged is politically-motivated discretionary
enforcement.58 Although the courts can do little to remedy this
state of affairs, it forms the basis for one of our basic
contentions: The political-social overtones of the marijuana
problem may inhibit a rational political and prosecutorial
response and at the same time may provoke a protective judicial
response. One judge, particularly expert with regard to
contemporary drug problems acknowledged the partial truth of the
charges of political prosecution against Hippies, long-hairs and
draft-card burning college students.59 To the extent that other
trial and appellate Judges recognize these prosecutorial
tendencies, we can expect some judicial compensation either in
fact-finding, in sentencing, or in response to substantive
challenges to the law. It is our contention, of course, that such
judicial reaction has already begun.<br>
</p>

<h3>C. Sufficiency of the Evidence</h3>

<p>The ease of identifying marijuana in conjunction with the use
of uncorroborated testimony and circumstantial evidence continues
to require of the prosecution only a very low burden of proof.
Nevertheless, appellate decisions are gradually beginning to
tighten these requirements, and active judicial hostility at
trial has all but disappeared. </p>

<p>Although the use of uncorroborated testimony to convict
continues to be upheld by the courts,60 an Illinois appellate
court has reversed a conviction because of the behavior of the
testifying officer.61 Noting that the officer had repeatedly
pressured the defendant to become an informer, the court held
that the uncorroborated testimony of this officer was not
sufficient to support a conviction. The court did not make clear
whether it exercised a weight of the evidence review of the trial
judge's fact-finding, or whether it applied an exclusionary
evidence rule pursuant to its inherent powers over the
administration of criminal justice. Whatever the case, judicial
perspective in the clash between marijuana defendant and police
officer has clearly shifted. </p>

<p>The amount of marijuana required to uphold a conviction is
undergoing substantial change. The California Supreme Court held
in People, v. Leal62 that to be sufficient for conviction, the
amount of narcotics must be enough for sale or consumption, the
rule generally applied where the statute does not specify a
minimum quantity.63 In Eckroth v. State64 a Florida court ruled
that the taking of a drug from a passing pipe is not sufficient
to constitute possession where the defendant did not own the
pipe, the drug or the premises. Similarly, in a case that
received national publicity,65 the Minnesota Supreme Court field
that if the state defines marijuana as a narcotic, it cannot
punish possession of what could be native cannabis in amounts too
scanty to produce a &quot;narcotic&quot; effect. Accordingly,
exiguous traces of the drug found in the crevices of defendant's
brief case left in his mistress' car did not constitute an amount
sufficient for conviction .66 </p>

<p>Other problems remain unsolved. Circumstantial evidence
continues to link defendants to seized marijuana. Constructive
possession was found where the defendant's daughter was the
actual possessor67 and the fact that marijuana was found where an
informer said she had seen defendant smoking it the previous day
was sufficient to support the defendant's conviction.68 There is
a split as to whether a conviction can be upheld where the
defendant gratuitously brings the buyer and seller together.
Massachusetts upheld the conviction for possession where the
defendant's only contact with the marijuana was passing it to the
state's agent,69 ruling that the facilitation of the sale added
enough to the act of passing to allow the court to find
possession. In a similar case, however, a New York court held
that there was not present the required involvement or concert of
action to uphold a conviction for sale.70 Nevertheless, courts
have refused conviction on numerous occasions in which the
defendant was not linked exclusively with the marijuana that was
found71 and have generally required an outside linking factor
before upholding the possession.72 However, the element that can
tip the scales in favor of conviction is often unrelated to the
possible possession of the marijuana. For example, a California
court73 upheld the finding of possession of marijuana discovered
along with a purse the defendants had stolen. The defendants
contended that the marijuana was not theirs and must have been in
the purse when stolen. That the defendants were thieves probably
played more heavily in the conviction than any evidence of their
connection with marijuana. </p>

<p>Where marijuana is found on the premises of the individual,
possession is presumed, although the courts have read in a
defense of ignorance of the presence of the marijuana.74
Nevertheless, in a New Hampshire case75 the court upheld a
possession conviction premised on the defendant's knowledge of
presence of the drug on the premises even though the court
apparently believed the defendant's story that it belonged to a
third party. Ordinarily there is direct corroborating evidence to
indicate the defendant's knowledge.76 </p>

<p>Along with the gradual thaw on these points in state courts,
the late sixties witnessed a total absence of the outrageous
judicial participation in inflammatory statements about the
dangers of the drug and its users which we saw was typical of the
late fifties. To the contrary, the appellate opinions, at least,
are replete with skeptical references to the inclusion of
marijuana in the narcotics classification .77<br>
</p>

<h3>D. Sanction</h3>

<p>Nowhere has judicial disenchantment with the drug laws,
especially marijuana, been greater than in the area of
punishment. Preference for civil treatment of drug abuse,78
disgust with severe mandatory sentencing that deprives the
Judiciary of its traditional function of weighing the culpability
of the individual offender, 79 and skepticism about a statutory
scheme which catches the user or small scale distributor and
misses the major trafficker80 have all found their way into
judicial opinions. </p>

<p>This dissatisfaction with legislative inaction in the area of
de-escalating punishment has already begun to provoke remedial81
judicial action. In a landmark decision82 receiving national
attention,83 the Supreme Court of New Jersey recently held that
any prison sentence imposed for first-offense possession of
marijuana for personal use &quot;should be suspended,&quot;84
While the court based its holding on the judiciary's statutory
authority to suspend sentences in &quot;the best interests of the
public as well as of the defendant,&quot;85 and on the appellate
court's power to review for abuse of discretion trial court
sentencing decisions, it appears that the true locus of the
opinion is the Eighth Amendment. That is, the court really
determined that any prison sentence for first-offense possession
of marijuana for personal use is unreasonably excessive.
Accordingly, the decision will be discussed in more detail in the
following section.86<br>

<p>10 395 U.S. at 52 53. Having found the &quot;knowledge&quot;
presumption unconstitutional, the court avoided consideration of
the &quot;illegal importation&quot; presumption. Id at 38. The
knowledge presumption has also be held invalid as applied to
hashish. United States v. Maestri, 424 F.2d 1066 (9<sup>th</sup>

Leary applies to hashish.) </p>

<p>In Turner v. United States, 396 U.S. 398 (1970), the Court
upheld the presumption in 21 U.S.C.  174 (1964) (direct
ancestor of  176a as applied to heroin but declared it
irrational as applied to cocaine. It has been held that Turner is

<p>13 United States v. Scott, 425 F.2d 55 (9th Cit. 1970). We
think the Ninth Circuit is right, at least with respect to
convictions secured after marijuana achieved high public
visibility in the 1960's. Since the number of people still
incarcerated for earlier convictions is minimal, complete
retroactive effect is in order. Essential to the Leary decision
was a determination that the presumption was factually
unsupportable; it therefore constituted a material flaw in the
fact-finding process and seriously impaired the right to jury
trial. </p>

<p>14 Absent the written order form requirement of the Marihuana
Tax Act, we do not see how prosecution under  176a involves the
fifth amendment at all. Neither did the Ninth Circuit. Id. at 61.

1970); McClain v. United States, 417 F.2d 489 (9th Cit. 1969). A
mere inference of importation is clearly not enough to sustain a
conviction since it would nullify Leary. Cf. United States v.
Ramos, 282 F. Supp. 354 (S.D.N.Y. 1968) (where Government failed
to prove possession beyond reasonable doubt, court could not
infer knowledge of importation). It is difficult to see how the
Government could raise an inference of knowledge without proving
actual knowledge. If, however, such can be done, it is clear that
the defendant has a right to prove that the marijuana was not
imported. United States v. Espinoza, 406 F.2d 733 (2d Cir.),

statute making it illegal to loiter about any &quot;stairway,
staircase, hall, roof, elevator, cellar, courtyard, or any
passageway of a building for the purpose of unlawfully using or
possessing any narcotic drug.&quot; The court distinguished the
ordinary vagrancy and loitering cases on the ground that the
conduct punished in the narcotics vagrancy statute is directly
related to the commission of crime against others: </p>

<p>[P] rotection of innocent citizens from drug users is a very
crucial problem. As has recently been pointed out by several
newspaper articles, in some of our poorer urban areas where drug
use is high, innocent citizens are often beaten, robbed and even
murdered by drug addicts .... It is completely reasonable and
proper for the Legislature to protect these citizens from
accidentally stumbling into the midst of such miscreants in the
common areas of buildings. </p>

That all justices concurred is indicative of the sentiment for
change. The court required the prosecution to disclose the
identity of the informant because he was essential to the
defenses of entrapment and lack of knowledge. The decision was
immediately implemented in People v. Marsden, 234 Cal. App. 2d
796, 44 Cal. Rptr. 728 (Dist. Ct. App. 1965). There, defendant
was repeatedly requested to furnish marijuana to a government
agent and finally purchased and gave the agent one marijuana
cigarette. The court noted that the case was close to entrapment
as a matter of law. </p>

<p>51 People v. Oatis, 264 Cal. App. 2d 324, 70 Cal. Rptr. 524
(Dist. Ct. App. 1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1108 (1969). </p>

<p>52 State v. Folsom, 463 P.2d 381 (Ore. 1970). </p>

<p>53 Commonwealth v. Harvard, 253 N.E.2d 346 (Mass. 1969);
Glosen v. Sheriff, 451 P.2d 841 (Nev. 1969). </p>

<p>54 Peters v. State, 450 S.W.2d 276 (Ark. 1970). Here the
defendant gave some marijuana free of charge to the agent after
repeated requests. The marijuana had been left in the defendant's
shop by others. In remanding the case for consideration by the
jury whether entrapment existed the court stated: </p>

<p>Perhaps, neither the persistent solicitation, the use of an
alias, the misrepresentation of the purposes for which [the
agent] wanted to acquire the marijuana nor the use of friends of
appellant for an entree, standing alone, would have been
sufficient to raise a fact question as to entrapment, but when
taken together along with the total lack of evidence that [the
defendant] had possessed or sold marijuana before, there was such
an issue. Id. at 278. </p>

<p>55 Froggatt v. State, 467 P.2d 1011 (Nev. 1970) (reversed for
failure to give entrapment<br>
instruction where policeman placed marijuana in defendant's car
and then Defendant sold it to another officer). </p>

<p>56 Compare Jordan v. United States, 416 F.2d 338 (9th Cir.
1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 920 (1970) (since three-month delay
was not purposeful, defendant must show actual prejudice), with
Ross v. United States, 349 F.2d 210 (D.C. Cir. 1965) (charges
dismissed since seven-month delay found purposeful). </p>

(1970). </p>

<p>59 Oliver, Assessment of Current Legal Practices from the
Viewpoint of the Courts, in DRUGS AND Youth 229 (J. Wittenborn
ed. 1969). Judge Oliver tried to minimize the seriousness of the
problem, However: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I think that as judge I must be interested in what might
    appear to be a pattern of discriminatory law enforcement, but
    I . . . consider much of this talk must be viewed with the
    same critical eye which most other talk about drug abuse must
    be viewed. </p>

<p>60 See, e.g., Winfield v. State, 248 Ind. 95, 223 N.E.2d 576
(1967). </p>

<p>61 People v. Quintana, 91 Ill. App. 2d 95, 234 N.E.2d 406
(1968). The court was greatly displeased with the continuing
misbehavior of the officer: &quot;[The 5-8 previous arrests and
shakedowns] were a high-handed display of police power which
completely disregarded the defendant's constitutional
rights.&quot; Id. at 98, 234 N.F.2d at 408. </p>

<p>62 64 Cal. 2d 504, 413 P.2d 665, 50 Cal. Rptr. 777 (1966)
(heroin). </p>

<p>63 People v. Villalobos, 245 Cal, App. 2d 561, 54 Cal. Rptr.
60 (Dist. Ct. App. 1966) (50 milligrams insufficient); see Tuttle
v. State, 410 S.W.2d 780 (Tex. Crim. App. 1967) (63 milligrams
sufficient, enough to make a very small cigarette); People v.
Hokuf, 245 Cal. App. 2d 394, 53 Cal. Rptr. 828 (Dist. Ct. App.
1966) (reversible error for the court not to instruct the jury
that fragments of marijuana cannot support conviction). But see
Franklin v. State, 8 Ind. App. 134, 258 A.2d 767 (1969) (heroin),
in which the court upheld a conviction for possession where the
defendant went to the hospital with an overdose. Although
recognizing that once the drug is inside the body there is no
possession because there is no control, the court felt that prior
possession and self-administration could be inferred. The
decision should do much to discourage addicts from receiving any
medical treatment that might expose them to criminal penalties. </p>

(one marijuana cigarette found in bathroom with two people, Home
owner convicted); People v. Van Syoc, 269 Cal. App. 2d 370, 75
Cal. Rptr. 490 (Dist. Ct. App. 1969) (marijuana found on
righthand side of the dashboard in defendant's car while parked
in public lot), People v. Evans, 72 Ill. App. 2d 146, 218 N.E.2d
781 (1966) (marijuana found under bar where defendant had been
sitting). </p>

<p>72 State v. Faircloth, 181 Neb. 333, 148 NW.2d 187 (1967)
(defendant had dufflebag<br>
full of marijuana between his legs in automobile); People v.
Blunt, 241 Cal. App. -Id 200, 50 Cal. Rptr. 440 (Dist. Ct. App.
1966) (defendant only one who had sat in back of police car where
Marijuana found). </p>

<p>73 People v. Irvin, 264 Cal. App. 2d 747, 70 Cal. Rptr. 892
(Dist. Ct. App. 1968). </p>

<p>74 See Commonwealth v. Buckley, 354 Mass. 508, 238 N.F.2d 335
(1968); People v. Mitchell, 51 Misc. 2d 82, 272 N.Y.S.2d 523

P.2d 628 (1968). </p>

<p>75 State v. Colcord, 109 N.H. 231, 248 A.2d 80 (1968). </p>

<p>76 The evidence of fragments of marijuana on the defendant
often provides this evidence, See, e.g., People v. Slade, 264
Cal. App. 2d 188, 70 Cal. Rptr. 321 (Dist. Ct. App. 1968); People
v. Haynes, 253 Cal. App. 2d 1060, 61 Cal. Rptr. 859 (Dist. Ct.
App. 1967), cert. denied, 392 U.S. 914 (1968); People v. Hurta,
238 Cal. App. 2d 162, 47 Cal. Rptr. 580 (Dist. Ct. App. 1965). </p>

<p>77 See 1131-32 infra. </p>

<p>78 E.g., Oliver, supra note W.<br>
</p>

<p>79 See, e.g., United Sates v. Kleinhalzer, 306 F. Supp. 311
(E.D.N.Y. 1969) (Weinstein, J.); Oliver, supra note 59, at 230: </p>

<p>In most other areas of the law, however, legislatures have
freely granted judges the power and discretion within quite
flexible limitations, to determine appropriate sentences for all
particular defendants before them that may or may not, dependent
upon the particular case, include commitment to a penal
institution. . . . </p>

<p>In the field of drug abuse, quite contrary to that experience,
mandatory prison sentences apparently reflect a legislative
conviction that all drug offenders are so alike that sending all
to prison is, in fact, a real solution to what must have been
viewed as a relatively simple problem. They also seem to reflect
a certainty and righteousness that can hardly be said to be
justified by our present scientific knowledge. </p>

<p>80 For example, in Aguilar v. United States, 363 F. 2d 379 (9<sup>th</sup>
Cir. 1966), the court affirming the smuggling conviction of a
Mexican mechanic driving a car containing marijuana back to the
United States, noted: </p>

<p>Here was a young man with a previous clean record, and there
was no indication he was a user of narcotics or inside a
narcotics ring. Apparently he was a victim of his personal
economics. When the law gets no closer than this to the real
rascal, one must wonder about the policy of it, although it be
beyond our function. </p>

<p>Id. at 381. See also Oliver, supra note 59, at 233 </p>

<p>81 What Justice Jackson said about adjudicative mood when the
death penalty hangs in the balance is equally appropriate with
regard to harsh marijuana penalties: </p>

<p>When the penalty is death, we, like state judges, are tempted
to strain the evidence and even, in close cases, the law in order
to give a doubtfully condemned man another chance. </p>

<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p>We wish to express our sincere appreciation to the students
who assisted us in the preparation of the tables at Appendix A.
Because the drug statutes of the several states are particularly
confusing and difficult to find, and because so many
jurisdictions have recently changed their drug laws, the
preparation of the chart required long, tedious work which so
many were kind enough to perform. To them, our most sincere
thanks. </p>

<p>We should like to thank especially Michael A. Cohen, John F.
Kuether, W. Tracey Shaw, Alan K. Smith, and Allan J. Tanenbaum,
all students at the University of Virginia School of Law, whose
research assistance and tireless effort were invaluable. </p>

<p>We are particularly indebted to Professor Jerry Mandel who
supplied us with much of the raw data used in the historical case
studies in this Article. In his excellent article on drug
statistics in the Stanford Low Review, Problems with Official
Drug Statistics, 21 STAN. L. REV. 991 (1969), Professor Mandel
suggested in a footnote that someone should attempt a history of
the passage of anti-marijuana legislation. We have followed his
suggestion and earnestly hope that our product will fill this
gap. </p>

<p>A modified and expanded version of this Article will be
published in book form in the spring of 1971.</p>

<h1>1. INTRODUCTION</h1>

<hr>

<p>Law may be rooted in fiction as well as fact. Indeed, a public
policy conceived in ignorance may be continuously reaffirmed,
ever more vehemently, so long as its origins remain obscure or
its fallacy unexposed. Yet once a spark of truth ignites the
public opinion process, the authority of time will not stay the
flames of controversy. In stable times the policy may soon be
reversed or modified to comport with reality. In volatile times,
however, a single controversy may lose its urgency. Fueled by
flames generated by related public issues, the fire may spread;
truth may again be consumed in the explosive collision of
competing cultural ideologies. </p>

<p>So it has been with marijuana.' Suppressed for forty years
without significant public attention, the &quot;killer weed&quot;
has suddenly surfaced as the preferred euphoriant of millions of
Americans. Hardly a day passes without public exposure to
propaganda from one side or the other. Hardly a day passes
without arrests of newsworthy figures for violations of marijuana
laws. Before legislatures and courts, the law is attacked and
defended with equal fervor. Sociological, medical and police
testimony regarding the drug's effects is delivered feverishly to
an attentive public. </p>

<p>Yet, apart from some expedient peripheral actions, little has
been done. Detailed studies have been commissioned, but there has
been no significant reconsideration of basic assumptions. Because
the marijuana issue has become ensnared in broader social
polemics, it has been stalemated. Stability and change, defiance
and repression, hippieism and middle-Americanism, &quot;law and
order&quot; and protest politics define the cultural milieu of
which the marijuana issue is viewed as but a symptom. </p>

<p>This Article is motivated by twin concerns: that the flagrant
disregard of marijuana laws bespeaks a growing disenchantment
with the capacity of our legal system rationally to order
society, and that the assimilation of the marijuana issue into
larger social conflicts has consigned the debate to the public
viscera instead of the public mind. Through a historical analysis
of the marijuana laws we hope to refocus the debate. An
understanding of the origins of the laws might modulate the
challengers' hostile accusations and at the same time promote in
legislators an awareness of their own responsibility. </p>

<p>For the purposes both of description and evaluation, law is
inseparable from the process by which it is adopted and the
values it manifests. Accordingly, our history focuses both on the
public policy formation process and on evolving patterns of our
culture. With respect to policy, formation, marijuana's legal
history is a significant illustration of the interaction of the
public opinion, legislative and judicial processes, and, in a
broader sense, the relation between folkways and gateways. With
respect to its value-content, the evolution of marijuana policy
reflects quite precisely emerging cultural attitudes toward
pluralism, privacy and individual pursuit of pleasure in an
increasingly mechanized and depersonalized technological society.
</p>

<hr>

<p>1Throughout its tumultuous history, the common name of the
cannabis drug has been spelled in numerous ways-marihuana,
meriguana, marijuana, marijuana. We will use the last spelling
because it appears most often in modern publications and conforms
more nearly to the Spanish. <br>

<p><b>THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT AND THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE: AN INQUIRY
INTO THE LEGAL HISTORY OF AMERICAN MARIJUANA PROHIBITION</b> </p>

<p><i>Richard J. Bonnie &amp; Charles H. Whitebread, II<br>
</i></p>

<p><b>II. THE ANTECEDENTS: CRIMINALIZATION OF NARCOTICS And
ALCOHOL </b></p>

<hr>

<p>The restrictive public policy with respect to marijuana,
initiated in the late twenties and thirties and perpetuated to
the present day, has never been an isolated phenomenon. At each
stage of its development marijuana policy has been heavily
influenced by other social issues because the drug has generally
been linked with broader cultural patterns. Particularly at its
inception, nationwide anti-marijuana legislation and its fate in
the courts were inseparably linked with the earlier
anti-narcotics and prohibition experiences. In fact, the facility
with which marijuana policy was initiated directly related to the
astoundingly sudden and extreme alteration of public narcotics
and alcohol policy between 1900 and 1920. </p>

<p>In 1906 there were only three dry states, and judicial
precedent abounded for the proposition that the right to possess
alcohol for private consumption was an inalienable right. Yet, by
1917, twenty states had enacted prohibitionary legislation and
most others were contemplating it. Two years later the eighteenth
amendment and the Volstead Act had been enacted, and it was a
federal crime to possess alcohol even for the purpose of drinking
it within the home. Similarly, in 1900 only a handful of states
in any way regulated traffic in narcotic drugs-opium, cocaine,
morphine and heroin-even though all but heroin had been available
for a decade or more. Yet, by 1914, all states had enacted some
type of prohibitionary legislation, and the national government
had enacted the Harrison Narcotic Act. </p>

<p>There were many major differences between the temperance and
anti-narcotics movements. The temperance movement was a matter of
vigorous public debate; the anti-narcotics movement was not.
Temperance legislation was the product of a highly organized
nationwide lobby; narcotics legislation was largely ad hoc.
Temperance legislation was designed to eradicate known evils
resulting from alcohol abuse; narcotics legislation was largely
anticipatory. </p>

<p>On the other hand, there were striking similarities between
the two movements. Both were first directed against the evils of
large scale use and only later against all use. Most of the
rhetoric was the same: These euphoriants produced crime,
pauperism and insanity. Both began on the state level and later
secured significant congressional action. Both ultimately found
favor with the courts, provoking interchangeable dissenting
opinions. </p>

<p>We do not propose to unearth new truths about the events of
this period. However, we do believe that a familiarity with the
political and judicial response to the alcohol and narcotics
problems is essential to an understanding of the eventual
suppression of marijuana. We believe further that an
understanding of the relation between public opinion and any
sumptuary law is germane to a discussion of the predicament of
current marijuana legislation. Finally, since much of the current
debate about marijuana is focused on its harmful effects as
compared with those of narcotics and alcohol, the evolution of
public policy in those areas is particularly material.<br>
</p>

<p><i>A. A Review of the Temperance Movement</i> </p>

<p>Although aggressive prohibition campaigns had been mounted in
every state in 1851-69,1 and again in 1880-90, in 1903 only Maine
(1884), Kansas (1880) and North Dakota (1889) were completely dry
states.2 Ernest Cherrington, the chronicler par excellence of the
Prohibition movement, blamed the failure of the first thrust in
part on the intervention of the slavery question, which siphoned
the moral fervor of the people from the temperance movement .4
The failure of the second campaign he attributed to the inability
of the prohibition activists to compete politically with growing
liquor interests that dominated state and local governments.5 </p>

<p>By 1906, however, the progress of the anti-saloon arm of the
temperance movement in local option contests&quot; and the
adoption of alcohol prohibition by the people of Oklahoma in a
provision of their constitution ratified upon admission to
statehood 7 signalled a new crusade for state prohibitionary
legislation. The Oklahoma vote so &quot;electrified the moral
forces of other states&quot; 8 that by 1913 six additional states
had enacted statewide prohibition, and half of the remaining
states were contemplating action.9 </p>

<p>Perhaps the most significant development during this period
occurred on the national level. The Supreme Court had earlier
declared the police powers of the states, under which state
prohibition laws were enacted, impotent to prevent importation of
liquor from a wet state, of which there were still many, into a
dry state and to stay the sale and delivery of such liquor to the
buyer while in the original package.&quot; </p>

<p>After a congressional attempt to deal with the decision in
1890 aborted in the courts,&quot; the buyer of liquor shipped in
interstate commerce still had the right to receive and therefore
to use such liquor. But in 1913 Congress, by the Webb-Kenyon Act,
12 filled the gap by prohibiting the shipment of liquor from one
state to another to be used in violation of the laws of the
latter; dry states could thus enforce their prohibition laws The
mere passage of this law, according to against imported liquor.13
</p>

<p>Cherrington, committed Congress to a policy that recognized
the liquor traffic as an outlaw trade and indicated congressional
desire to assist the dry states. 14 </p>

<p>By November 1913, the tide had decidedly turned. More than
half the population and 71 percent of the area of the United
States were under prohibitionary laws.&quot;, Accordingly, the
Fifteenth National Convention of the Anti-Saloon League of
America unanimously endorsed immediate passage of National
Constitutional Prohibition, whereupon the National Temperance
Council was formed to combine the forces of the various
temperance organizations toward this end. 16 </p>

<p>By April 4, 1917, when a joint resolution was introduced in
the Senate proposing an amendment to the Constitution prohibiting
the manufacture, sale or transportation of intoxicating liquors
within the United States for beverage purposes, 17 eighty percent
of the territory of the United States was dry.&quot; Adopted by
the constitutional majorities of both houses on December 18,
1917, the eighteenth amendment was ratified by the thirty-sixth
state on January 16, 1919, and became effective on January 16,
1920.19 The Volstead Act,&quot; passed on October 28, 1919,
pursuant to section 2 of the eighteenth amendment, outlawed
possession of intoxicating liquor and therefore went
significantly beyond the amendment itself. </p>

<p>The National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement (the
Wickersham Commission) attributed the passage of the eighteenth
amendment not to public opposition to use of intoxicating
beverages,&quot; although this was indeed the view of many of the
leaders of the movement, but rather to antipathy to three major
related evils: excessive consumption, political corruption and
licensed saloons .22 </p>

<p>Excessive use increased with the commercialization of
production and distribution, and the expansion of saloons. Public
resentment against the corrupting influence of the large liquor
dealers in local politics, especially in the larger cities,
tended to focus public attention on removing a cancer from the
body politic. Finally, the institution that most strongly aroused
public sentiment against liquor traffic was the licensed saloon,
itself the symbol of intemperance and corruption. Owned or
controlled by the large brewers or wholesalers, centers of
political activity, homes of commercialized vice, the saloons
were the betes noires of middle-American public opinion. </p>

<p>Because public opinion was largely opposed only to the
socio-political consequences of massive liquor traffic, the
enforcement of total abstinence under the eighteenth amendment
became increasingly difficult. By 1931 it was an accepted fact
that the upper and middle classes were &quot;drinking in large
numbers in quite frank disregard of the declared policy&quot; of
the Volstead Act.&quot; </p>

<p>The difficulties of securing compliance in such circumstances
were aggravated by an inadequately designed enforcement strategy,
24, public resentment of the lawless tactics of prohibition
agents, 25 and the lack of any sustained attempt at public
education.26 For twelve years, however, millions of dollars were
spent by federal and state governments in a fruitless effort to
secure compliance with the law. Contemporary legal observers were
particularly incensed by the dilution of constitutional
protections, especially those provided by the fourth amendment,
which was sanctioned by the courts in response to the &quot;felt
needs&quot; of securing compliance through enforcement alone.27 </p>

<p>Although many plans were advanced for changing the prohibition
laws to mitigate the lawlessness rampant during this period, as
late as 1931 even its most vigorous opponents felt that repeal of
the eighteenth amendment was politically unfeasible.28 By 1932,
however, public opinion had become so inflamed that the
Democratic National Convention included repeal in the party
platform.&quot;' Proposed by Congress on February 20, 1933, the
twenty-first amendment was ratified by the thirty sixth state on
December 5, 1933.<br>
</p>

<p><i>B. Anti-Narcotics Legislation to 1914</i> </p>

<p>For our purposes, the major feature of temperance history is
the responsiveness of the political process to public opinion.
Whether or not a majority of Americans ever favored prohibition
and whether or not the thrust of public opinion was ever
accurately assessed, the public opinion process was attuned to
the question for half a century. The alleged evils of alcohol
abuse were matters of public knowledge; the proper governmental
response was a subject of endless public debate; enactment and
repeal of Prohibition were attended by widespread public
participation. </p>

<p>In contrast, the early narcotics legislation was promulgated
largely in a vacuum. Public and even professional ignorance of
the effects of narcotic drugs contributed both to the dimensions
of the problem and the nature of the legislated cure. The initial
legislation was attended by no operation of the public opinion
process, and instead generated a new public image of narcotics
use. Only after this creation of a public perception occurred did
the legislative approach comport with what we shall call latent
public opinion. <br>
</p>

<p><i>1. Narcotics Use at the Turn of the Century: A Growing
Problem <br>
</i></p>

<p>Although estimates have varied widely regarding the number of
persons regularly using cocaine, opium, morphine and heroin
during the pre-criminalization period, a sufficiently accurate
figure can be drawn from a composite of contemporary surveys30
conducted between 1878 and 1924 .31 Estimates range from 182,215
(1884) to 782,118 (1913). We can safely estimate that there were
between one-quarter and one-half million Americans addicted to
narcotics around the turn of the century, comprising at least one
percent of the population.&quot; </p>

<p>This rather large addict population included more females than
males,33 more whites than blacks,&quot; and was confined neither
to particular geographical regions nor to areas of high
population concentrations Its most significant characteristic was
its predominantly middle-class composition. Such attributes
contrast starkly with the overwhelmingly black, lower-class male
addict population that today inhabits our major urban centers. </p>

<p>Nineteenth century narcotics addiction was generally
accidental. It is widely believed that medical addicts far
outnumbered &quot;kicks&quot; or pleasure&quot; addicts.37
Medical addiction stemmed from many sources. The first was
overmedication. Civil War hospitals used opium and morphine
freely and many veterans returned addicted to the drugs.&quot;
Overmedication continued long after peace had been restored, due
to the ready availability of these drugs with and sometimes
without prescription. Since physicians were free to dispense
these drugs as painkillers, persons given morphine first for
legitimate therapeutic purposes often found themselves addicted.
39 This problem was exacerbated by the absence of restrictions
upon druggists in refilling prescriptions containing extensive
amounts of morphine and other opiates40 and by the introduction
of the hypodermic syringe.&quot; The danger of overmedication
increased in 1884 when cocaine was first introduced into the
practice of medicine, and again in 1898 when an advance in German
chemistry produced heroin, a partially synthetic morphine
derivative. 42 For a time recommended as a treatment for morphine
addiction ,43 heroin was also widely used for medicinal purposes.
</p>

<p>A second source of accidental addiction was the use and
popularity of patent medicines. Exotically labeled elixirs were
advertised as general cures for- ills ranging from snake bite to
melancholia. By containing up to thirty or forty percent morphine
or opiates by volume, most patent medicines fulfilled their
cure-all promises. However, a heavy price was exacted for such
cures. In the absence of a requirement that contents be printed
on the label, many an unsuspecting person became addicted without
ever knowing the medicine that worked so well contained dangerous
narcotics.44 </p>

<p>Thus, careless prescription, incessant dispensation and hidden
distribution of harmful drugs, the addictive effects of which
were unknown until too late, fostered a large addict population
which continued to increase in the early twentieth century. The
increase in narcotics consumption, and therefore addiction, is
well illustrated by the fact that 628,177 pounds of opiates were
brought into this country in 1900, three times the amount
imported thirty years earlier.&quot; Governmental and medical
default explains the innocent nature of nineteenth century
narcotics addiction and therefore its predominantly middle-class,
nationwide character. </p>

<p>Not all addiction was accidental and private. It has been
suggested that both medical knowledge and governmental regulation
occurred only when each narcotic drug achieved a significant
degree of &quot;street&quot; use. Our research supports this
thesis, especially when &quot;street&quot; use is identified with
the poor and with racial minorities. For example, opium, the drug
first determined addictive and first identified with &quot;
pleasure&quot; use, was the earliest prohibited. Legislation was
first passed in the west coast states with newly immigrated
Chinese populations among whom its use was prevalent. Heroin
early achieved a widespread nonmedical or &quot;street&quot; use,
especially in large urban centers among lower-class males.&quot;'
</p>

<p>Nevertheless, addiction, even to opium, was predominantly
involuntary until 1900. Professional attention was not focused
directly on! Street&quot; use until after two developments had
significantly reduced the: possibility of medical addiction.
First, the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act48 in 1906 led to
the demise of the patent medicine industry,: one of the primary
causes of medical addiction. The labeling requirements of the
Act, coupled with the later regulation of the production and
distribution of the opiates, protected the public from the
dangers of ignorance and virtually put the patent medicine
industry out of business.49 Second, the discovery of new
nonaddictive pain killers and anesthetics reduced the likelihood
of post-operative addiction since physicians no longer needed to
rely so heavily on morphine and opium. preparations to reduce and
control pain.<br>
</p>

<p>2. State Legislative Response Before 1914 </p>

<p>Although many states regulated narcotics indirectly through
their general &quot;poison laws&quot; before 1870,50 the first
anti-narcotics legislation did not appear until the last quarter
of the nineteenth century. Most of the early legislation focused
primarily on crime prevention&quot; and public education
regarding the dangers of drug use.&quot; The spread of opium
smoking, especially in the western states with high oriental
populations,53 provoked legislation in eighteen states between
1877 and 1911 designed to eradicate the practice either by
preventing the operation of opium dens or by punishing the
smoking of opium altogether. 54 As the addictive qualities of
opium, cocaine, morphine and later heroin became known, primarily
through observation of &quot;street&quot; use, concerned
physicians finally began to agitate for stricter regulation than
that provided by the &quot;poison laws,&quot; even though such
laws included opium and cocaine. Nevada enacted the first law
prohibiting the retail sale of opiates for nonmedical purposes in
1877.55 In 1887, Oregon prohibited sale of cocaine without a
prescription,&quot;&quot; and seven states followed suit by the
turn of the century57 as did thirty-nine more by 1914.58 However,
only twenty-nine states had included opiates in their
prohibitionary legislation by 1914.59 </p>

<p>With the exception of the Oregon schemes nineteenth century
narcotic laws did not attempt to restrict or prohibit possession
of narcotics, and were directed solely at distribution and sale.
By 1913, only six states had prohibited the mere possession of
restricted drugs by unauthorized persons .61 Three additional
states prohibited possession with intent illegally to dispense
such drugs .62 <br>
</p>

<p>3. Watershed: The Passage of the Harrison Act </p>

<p>The first national legislation designed to regulate narcotics
distribution, the 1909 &quot;Act to Prohibit Importation and Use
Of Opium&quot;' 63 barred the importation of opium at other than
specified ports and for other than medicinal use. The law further
required the keeping of import records. The main force behind the
passage of this statute was a desire to bring the United States
into line with other nations that had signed international
conventions against the use of the drug. 64 However, as state
anti-narcotics legislation began to take on crusade proportions,
pressure was generated for federal regulation of the importation
of opium for medicinal purposes and of the interstate trade in
cocaine, morphine and heroin. Consequently, the Harrison Act,
until this year the foundation of federal law controlling
narcotic drugs, was passed in 1914.65 </p>

<p>The Harrison Act, a taxing measure, required registration and
payment of an occupational tax by all persons who imported,
produced, dealt in, sold or gave away opium, cocaine or their
derivatives. The Act required all legitimate handlers of these
narcotics to file returns setting forth in detail their use of
the drugs. Each legitimate handler was required to use a special
order form in making any transfer of narcotics. Since the Act
also provided that only legitimate users could register and no
one but a registered user could obtain the specified form, any
transfer by an illegitimate user was a violation of the Act. For
those failing to comply with its registration requirements, the
original Harrison Act provided penalties of not more than $2,000
in fines or more than five years imprisonment, or both. </p>

<p>The passage of the Harrison Act was the culmination of
increasing concern in the medical profession66 about the freedom
with which physicians prescribed and druggists dispensed
addictive drugs, primarily morphine and heroin. During the period
of little or no regulation, the innocent addicts were regarded as
victims of an unfortunate sickness in need of treatment; usually
they could find a friendly physician or druggist willing to
sustain their habits. The passage of the Harrison Act, however,
by imposing a stamp of illegitimacy on most narcotics use,
fostered an image previously associated primarily with opium that
of the degenerate dope fiend with immoral proclivities. As the
regulation of physicians and druggists became more stringent,
especially after the Supreme Court held that prevention of
withdrawal was not a legitimate medical use that a prescription
to an unregistered person,67 this image fulfilled itself. All
addicts, whether accidental or pleasure-seeking, were shut off
from their supply and had to turn underground to purchase the
drugs. Inflated underground prices often provoked criminal
activity and this activity in turn evoked in the public a moral
response,, cementing the link between iniquity and. drug
addiction.68 </p>

<p>The early clinical experiments dealing with narcotics
addiction were inevitable victims of enforcement of the
Act.&quot; The concept that underlay the clinical effort-that
addiction was a medical problem to be dealt with by sustaining
the addict cheaply while trying to induce gentle withdrawal-was
antithetical to the attitude provoking the criminal
classification of unlawful possessors of narcotic drugs.&quot;
Clinics were run .in such cities as New York, Shreveport and
Jacksonville,&quot; but by 1923 all were closed, thus removing
still another legitimate source of supply for the addict. Again,
the crimes committed to enable these people to tap I the illicit
sources increased public hysteria and misunderstanding 72 about
the link between the opiates and crime. </p>

<p>Another result of the physicians' resignation to pressure was
that addicts to the opiates began to commit petty crimes in order
to secure the drugs which could prevent their suffering. These
inevitable law-induced crimes greatly accentuated the general
public belief that opiates had some inherent sinister property
which could change normal people into moral perverts and
criminals. </p>

<p>In addition to redefining the public conception of narcotic
addiction in a way that would not be seriously challenged for
half a century, the Harrison Act also provided a strange model
for the administration of narcotics laws which would
significantly affect future developments' Drafted as a tax law
rather than an outright criminal statute, the Act was intended to
do indirectly what Congress believed it could not do
directly-regulate possession and sale of the opiates. Indeed,
congressional caution was justified. A five-to-four decision by
the Supreme Court in the 1903 Lottery Case73 suggested what later
became fact-the Court, as self-appointed arbiter of the federal
system, would plant the tenth amendment in the path of
congressional regulation of &quot;local&quot; affairs. That
direct regulation of medical practice was indeed considered
beyond congressional power under the commerce clause is clearly
indicated in contemporary opinions. First, in its 1918 decision
in Hammer V. Dagenhart,74 the Court held the Child Labor Act
unconstitutional. Second, the Court ultimately upheld the
Harrison Act as a valid exercise of the taxing power 75 only by a
five-to-four margin. Finally, there is some fairly explicit
language about congressional regulation of medical practice in
subsequent Harrison Act opinions.76 </p>

<p>This indirect regulation of narcotics traffic under the
pretext of raising revenue had a number of significant
consequences. First, since the Act could not penalize users or
addiction directly, there was an immediate need for complementary
residual state legislation in order to deal effectively with the
drug problem. Second, the enforcement of the Act was necessarily
assigned to the Internal Revenue Service in the Treasury
Department. </p>

<p>The first enforcement agency for the Harrison Act was the
Narcotics Division of the Prohibition Unit of the Internal
Revenue Service created in 1920.77 This division was incorporated
in the Prohibition Bureau which was created in 1927 .78 In 1930,
the enforcement of the narcotics laws was severed from the Bureau
of Prohibition and established as the separate Bureau of
Narcotics in the Treasury Department .79 The existence of this
separate agency anxious to fulfill its role as crusader against
the evils of narcotics has done as much as any single factor to
influence the course of drug regulation from 1930 to 1970.&quot;
Although the impact of the Bureau on the passage of the Uniform
Narcotic Drug Act and the Marihuana Tax Act will be explained in
detail in subsequent sections, it is important here to note that
the existence of a separate bureau having responsibility only for
narcotics enforcement and for educating the public on drug
problems inevitably led to a particularly prosecutorial view of
the narcotics addict. Moreover, this creation of the Bureau
separate from the newly created FBI in the justice Department
unnecessarily bifurcated federal law enforcement operations in
this area. </p>

<p>C. The Judicial Role and the Constitutional Framework: </p>

<p>The Police Power and Intoxicant Prohibition to 1920 </p>

<p>It is not novel to suggest that the fate of contemporary
constitutional challenges to marijuana prohibition depends in
part on a judicial reading of public opinion as well as on the
availability of a constitutional peg on which to hang an
&quot;activist&quot; judicial inquiry. Since contextual pressure
and analytical conflict were also central elements of the
'Judicial response to alcohol and narcotics prohibition between
1850 and 1920, it is worthwhile to trace that response. </p>

<p>As in today's court battles over marijuana laws, the clash
then was between two polar constitutional concepts-the police
powers of the state and allegedly &quot;fundamental&quot;
personal constitutional rights. The conflict opened on state
constitutional grounds and was continued in the realm of the
fourteenth amendment. On the issues of alcohol and
&quot;hard&quot; narcotics, the police power was triumphant. In
the light of the comparisons drawn in current constitutional
arguments among marijuana , alcohol and narcotics, an inquiry
into the long struggle is informative. </p>

<p>1. Phase One: Prohibition of Sale and Manufacture of Alcohol </p>

<p>During the first wave of prohibitionist legislation in the
1850's, thirteen en states outlawed manufacture&quot; and sale of
intoxicating beverages.&quot; The constitutionality of such laws
under the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution had been
presaged in the License Case83 in 1847, where in six separate
opinions the Supreme Court upheld Massachusetts, New Hampshire
and Rhode Island laws regulating wholesale and retail sales of
liquor. Chief Justice Taney's famous dictum stated: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>And if any State deems the retail and internal traffic in
    ardent spirits injurious to its citizens, and calculated to
    produce idleness, vice, or debauchery, I see nothing, in the
    constitution of the United States to prevent it from
    regulating and restraining the traffic, or from prohibiting,
    it altogether, if it thinks proper.84 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Armed with this pronouncement, the courts of eight states
rebuffed challenges under their own constitutions.&quot; Some of
these decisions gave scant attention to the constitutional
argument but simply defined the police power broad terms86 and
perhaps cited the Taney dictum. </p>

<p>However, the rationale and rhetoric of those decisions
squarely rejecting the constitutional objections merit a detailed
comparison with that of two decisions, in New York88 and
Indiana89, declaring the statutes void. </p>

<p>Even the opponents of the laws acknowledged the potential
public evils of intemperance90crime, pauperism and vice-the
eradication of which was the objective of prohibitionary
legislation. Yet they argued that the means employed to
accomplish this end-prevention of sale was beyond the police
power. Alcohol had admittedly beneficial use91 and was harmful
only when abused.92 In order to eliminate it from channels of
commerce, thereby depriving its owners of a -fundamental incident
of ownership-the right to sell93 -a more pernicious character had
to be shown. 94 Accordingly, the public benefit did not justify
the restriction of private rights. The criminalization of sale of
alcohol beverages constituted a deprivation of
&quot;property&quot; without due process;95 or, failing that, it
constituted an infringement of the inalienable right of 1ife,
liberty And the pursuit of happiness rooted in the precepts of
natural justice that the people reserved to themselves when they
entered into the social compact.96 New York, in Wynehamer v.
People,97 accepted .the due process argument, at least with
respect to alcohol lawfully acquired, and Indiana endorsed the
inalienable rights argument in Beebe v. State.98 </p>

<p>The virtues of judicial restraint were vehemently defended in
the decisions rejecting these arguments: The courts uniformly
refused to interfere with the discretionary exercise of the
police power in the absence of a specific constitutional
prohibition. The Vermont Supreme Court view was typical: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The legislature in passing the law in question doubtless
    supposed that the traffic and drinking of intoxicating
    liquors went hand in hand ... and that, by cutting off the
    one, the other would also fall with it. Whether the drinking
    of intoxicating liquors tends to produce intemperance and
    whether the intemperance is a gangrene, tending to corrupt
    the moral health of the body politic, and to produce misery
    and lamentation; and whether the law in question is well
    calculated to cut off or mitigate the evils supposed to flow
    directly from intemperance and indirectly from the traffic in
    intoxicating liquors, were questions to be settled by the
    lawmaking power; and their decision in this respect is final
    and not to be reviewed by us.99 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Under this view, societal self-protection, the essence of the
police power, is broadly defined.100 So long as the legislature
determines that the use of alcoholic beverages exerts an adverse
effect on public, health, safety or morals, the courts may
question neither the factual determination nor the means employed
to restrict that use. In answer to the argument that the courts
have a special obligation to review the relation between means
and ends where personal liberties are curtailed, these courts
disavowed any power &quot;to annul a legislative Act upon higher
grounds than those of express constitutional restriction,&quot;
101 or, after assuming for sake of argument the existence of such
power, they declined to exercise It.102 In response to the
argument accepted by Judge Comstock in Wynehamer v. New York-that
prohibition of sale of legally acquired alcohol was a deprivation
of property without due process of law-most courts distinguished
Wynehamer on its facts,103 held that no essential
&quot;property&quot; right had been violated,&quot;&quot; or
construed &quot;due process&quot; to refer only to due procedure
and not to the &quot;power ... to create and define an
offense.&quot; 105 </p>

<p>Two polar conceptions of the scope of 'Judicial review clashed
over a subject of intense public interest. The immediate question
was settled in favor of the constitutionality of prohibiting
manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages; in fact, the Indiana
court itself disavowed its contrary decision in Beebe three years
after rendering it.106 However, the jurisprudential dialogue107
had merely begun. Today, Wynehamer is regarded as the initial
step, on the road to the vested rights conception of due process.
Similarly, Beebe is the philosophical ancestor of all challenges
to prohibition of intoxicants alcohol, narcotics, and
marijuana.108 </p>

<p>With the passage of the fourteenth amendment, the Supreme
Court was called upon to determine whether prohibitionary
exercises of the state police powers were now limited by federal
law. The battle fought in the 1850's on state constitutional
grounds was refought in the 1870's and 80's on federal
territory-with the same outcome. In a series of cases culminating
in Mugler v. Kansas,109 it slowly became settled that the
manufacturer or seller of intoxicating liquors had no
constitutional rights under either the privileges and immunities
or due process clauses that could prevent the operation of the
police power of the state, regardless whether the liquor was
bought or manufactured before passage of the law or even whether
it was manufactured solely for personal use.110 </p>

<p>Thus, as a matter of both state and federal constitutional
law, the courts required no more, and probably less, than that
legislation be designed to retard a public evil-here pauperism
and crime-and be rationally related to that end.&quot;' Absent a
specific constitutional limitation, it did not concern the courts
that such regulations affronted personal liberty and property
rights. The theoretical Justification of incidental curtailment
of private liberties in the public interest was that the
legislature must conduct the balancing; if the balance is
unsound, the law will be repealed. Indeed, the courts were
probably willing to indulge that presumption as a practical
matter since the passage of the prohibition laws was preceded by
vigorous public debate. In fact, the public opinion process did
work in reaction to these curtailments of private liberty, and
most such laws were subsequently repealed&quot;' in the ensuing
decade. </p>

<p>2. Phase Two: Probibition of Sale of Opium </p>

<p>As noted above, the first prohibitionary narcotics legislation
was enacted on the west coast in the 1880's in order to prohibit
sale and distribution of opium for nonmedical purposes. The
racial overtonesof this legislation were self-consciously
acknowledged by the initial Oregon and Nevada decisions.
Sustaining the conviction of an alien for selling opium in Ex
parte Yung Jon,&quot;' the Oregon district court noted: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Smoking opium is not our vice, and therefore it may be
    that this legislation proceeds more from a desire to vex and
    annoy the &quot;Heathen Chinee&quot; in this respect, than to
    protect the people from the evil habit. But the motives of
    legislators cannot be the subject of judicial investigation
    for the purpose of affecting the validity of their acts. 114 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The opium laws were attacked on precisely the same grounds as
had been the alcohol prohibition legislation. The Nevada court
had no trouble in State v. Ah Chew;115 it simply cited the
License Cases, the Delaware decision sustaining prohibition of
alcohol sale, and distinguished Wynebamer as holding only that
the sale of lawfully acquired property could not be prohibited.
Within this framework, the result was obvious: </p>

<p>It is not denied that the indiscriminate use of opium . . .
tends in a much greater degree to demoralize the persons using
it, to dull the moral senses, to foster vice and produce crime,
than the sale of intoxicating drinks. If such is its tendency, it
should not have unrestrained license to produce such disastrous
results.... Under the police power . . . in the interest of good
morals, the good order and peace of society, for the prevention
of crime, misery and want, the legislature has authority to place
such restrictions upon sale or disposal of opium a,, will
mitigate, if not suppress, its evils to society.116 </p>

<p>The Oregon court, in the Yung Jon decision five years later,
did not take the easy way out. The court was apparently not
disposed to imply that sale of previously owned alcohol and
cigarettes could be prohibited, and thus reject outright the
Wynebamer conception of due process;117 instead it chose to hold
that sale of opium for nonmedical purposes was not an incident of
ownership and, since the law did not prohibit sale for medical
purposes, no property right was deprived. Not as cautious as his
brethren, Judge Deady inquired more actively into the nature of
opium before upholding the legislation. Whether a legislative act
is &quot;prohibitory&quot; (and by implication whether it
violates the due process clause) &quot;must depend on
circumstances, and particularly the character of the article, and
the uses and purposes to which it has generally been applied in
the community.&quot; 118 He then noted that opium was primarily a
medicinal drug; that although used in the East for centuries as
an intoxicant, that use was new in the United States and confined
primarily to the Chinese; that it was classed as a poison and was
less easily detected than alcoholic intoxication, &quot;which it
is said to replace where law and custom have made the latter
disreputable;&quot; and that its &quot;evil effects&quot; were
manifest upon the nervous and digestive systems, resembling
delirium tremens. Thus, there was no longstanding regard of opium
as a legitimate article of property except for medical use.
Accordingly, the act does not in effect prohibit the disposition
of the drug, but allows it under such circumstances, and on such
conditions, as will, according to the general practice and
opinions of the country, prevent its improper and harmful use.119
</p>

<p>Thus, whatever the judicial propensity to limit the police
power in the interest of property rights, prohibition of traffic
in opium-worse than alcohol and confined to aliens-violated no
implied or express constitutional limitations.<br>
</p>

<p>3. Phase Three: Prohibition of Possession of Alcohol to 1915 </p>

<p>At this stage of constitutional jurisprudence, criminalization
of possession or consumption of alcohol or narcotics was arguably
a deprivation of property without due process of law. The first
wave of prohibition cases had held only that the right to sell
even previously acquired liquor was not an essential element of
ownership. They had not held that the state could forbid the
essential attribute of ownership-the right to use. In fact, many
courts had expressly noted that alcohol was still a legitimate
article of property.120 </p>

<p>Until 1915 the weight of authority was that it was beyond the
police power to prohibit mere possession of alcoholic beverages
unless the quantity Justified an inference that they were held
for sale. A few cases so held ;121 many courts so stated in
dictum, while holding the laws either in conflict with particular
constitutional provisions regarding the &quot;sale&quot; of
liquor&quot;122 or in excess of the power of municipal
corporations;&quot; and many contemporary commentators so stated
.124 </p>

<p>Although the due process rationale was sometimes employed, 125
the preferred approach was &quot;inherent&quot; limitation. In
his 1904 treatise, Police Power, Ernst Freund premised the
&quot;inherent&quot; limitation of noninterference with purely
private conduct not on any inalienable natural right but on the
requirement that interference be justified on grounds of the
public welfare.&quot;' This and the &quot;practical difficulties
of enforcement, coupled with the constitutional prohibition of
unreasonable searches,&quot; 127 would sufficiently deter
legislative abuse. </p>

<p>Absent the addition of a natural rights notion, however, this
decisional frame becomes ambivalent on the dispositive question
in an adjudication questioning such legislative
&quot;abuse&quot;: Can the mere &quot;policy&quot; of
nonintervention with private conduct a more rigorous judicial
inquiry into the relation between the prohibited private acts and
the alleged public evil? If it cannot, the constitutional attack
on prohibition of possession is no stronger than that on
prohibition of sale. If it can, is not the judicial role subject
to the same charge of usurpation as it would be if the courts
employed a pure natural rights approach? </p>

<p>In any event, when the courts first confronted possession
prohibition, the rhetoric was varied-due process, 128 natural
rights&quot;' and private liberty&quot;&quot;-but the approach
was the same-a refusal to accept the legislative findings as to
the relation between private act and public harm and a refusal to
defer to the legislative balance of private liberty and public
need. For example, in one of the leading cases, Commonwealth v.
Campbell,&quot;' the Court of Appeals of Kentucky cited Cooley,
Mill, and Blackstone for the proposition that </p>

<p>[i]t is not within the competency of government to invade the
privacy of the citizen's life and to regulate his conduct in
matters in which he alone is concerned, or to prohibit him any
liberty the exercise of which will not directly injure
society.132 </p>

<p>Noting next that defendant was &quot;not charged with having
the liquor in his possession for the purpose of selling it, or
even giving it to another&quot; and that &quot;ownership and
possession cannot be denied when that ownership and possession is
not in itself injurious to the public,&quot; 133 the court
concluded that </p>

<p>the right to use liquor for one's own comfort, if the use is
without direct injury to the public, is one of the citizen's
natural and inalienable rights .... We hold that the police
power-vague and wide and undefined as it is-has limits . . . 134 </p>

<p>The key to this reasoning, of course, is the court's
insistence that the injury be direct as measured according to a
Judicial yardstick. Although the court devoted little attention
to the question, it implicitly rejected arguments that the only
way to exorcize the public evils attending excessive use and
adequately to enforce prohibitions against sale was to prevent
any private use at all. The court impliedly held that the posited
connection, albeit rational, was &quot;remote&quot; or
&quot;indirect&quot; or &quot;unreasonable&quot; and therefore
entitled to no deference. 135<br>
</p>

<p>4. Phase Four: Prohibition of Possession of Narcotics </p>

<p>This active 'Judicial role in alcohol cases should be compared
with the courts' simultaneous refusals to second-guess
legislative &quot;findings&quot; with regard to the
criminalization of possession of opium. In a series of cases
decided in Washington, Oregon and California136 in 1890, 1896 and
1911 respectively, courts held that the relation between
narcotics use and public harm was to be drawn by the legislature.
</p>

<p>In answer to the argument, accepted in the alcohol cases, that
despite the absence of explicit constitutional limitations the
police power of prohibition was inherently limited to acts which
&quot;involve direct and immediate injury to another,&quot; 137
the courts replied in predictable fashion: The state may prevent
a weak man from doing injury to himself if it determines that
such injury may cause the individual to become a &quot;burden on
society;&quot; &quot;' the state could find that excessive use of
opium, an active poison, would debase the moral and economic
welfare of' the society by causing ill health, pauperism and
insanity;... the state could find that the potential for and
evils attending excessive use demand a prohibition also of
nondeleterious moderate use.&quot;' Accordingly, in the words of
the Supreme Court of Washington, </p>

<p>[i]t is for the legislature to place on foot the inquiry as to
just in what degree the use is injurious; to collate all the
information and to make all the needful and necessary
calculations. These are questions of fact with which the court
cannot deal. The constitutionality of laws is not thus to be
determined .141 </p>

<p>The California court had more difficulty with the argument
that punishment of possession of alcohol had been held beyond the
police power. Despite its rhetoric regarding the wide bounds of
legislative fact-finding, the court actually made its own
determination that public injury from private abuse was more
likely with narcotics than alcohol. The lower court had said so
overtly: </p>

<p>But liquor is used daily in this and other countries as a
beverage, moderately and without harm, by countless thousands ...
; whereas it appears there is no such thing as moderation in the
use of opium. Once the habit is formed the desire for it is
insatiable, and its use is invariably disastrous. 142 </p>

<p>The California Supreme Court shied away: </p>

<p>We do not understand this to have been intended to declare an
established or conceded fact. So interpreted, the expression
would be, perhaps unduly sweeping. But the validity of
legislation which would be necessary or proper under a given
state of facts does not depend upon the actual existence of the
supposed facts. It is enough if the law-making body may
rationally believe such facts to be established. If the belief
that the use of opium, once begun, almost ]Inevitably leads to
excess may be entertained by reasonable men-and we do not doubt
that it may-such belief affords a sufficient 'Justification for
applying to opium restrictions which might be unduly burdensome
in the case of other substances, as, for example, intoxicating
liquors, the use of which may fairly be regarded as less
dangerous to their users or to the public. 143 </p>

<p>What the court said is unobjectionable. What it did not say,
however, is significant. This reasoning implies that if the
legislature should determine that the potential for excessive use
of alcohol-and consequently for the public evils of pauperism,
crime and insanity-is great enough to prohibit all use, that
judgment would have to stand. Probably not intending so to
suggest, the court really held that it thought that opium use was
more likely adversely to affect the public welfare than alcohol
use; accordingly, paternal criminal legislation was
&quot;reasonable&quot; in the former case and not in the latter,
even though they were identically &quot;Indirect.&quot; It
helped, perhaps, that the legislature was not telling the and his
white, middle-class colleagues that they shouldn't smoke opium,
and that the objective was merely to prevent a few &quot;Heathen
Chinee&quot; from hurting themselves through their stupidity and
from spreading their nasty habit to the whites.&quot;' </p>

<p>The only astounding thing about the opium possession cases is
that there was at least one dissenting opinion. In the Washington
case, Ah Lim v. Territory,145 judge Scott, for himself and
another judge, insisted on either a more conclusive demonstration
that the private act of smoking opium &quot;directly and clearly
affected the public in some manner&quot; or a more narrowly drawn
statute. He catalogued the alleged public justifications: </p>

<p>That smoking or inhaling opium injures the health of the
individual, and in this way weakens the state; that it tends to
the increase of pauperism. That it destroys the moral sentiment
and leads to the commission of crime. In other words, that it has
an injurious effect upon the individual, and, consequently,
results indirectly in an injury to the community. 146 </p>

<p>After noting the insufficiency of all of the 'Justifications
including the argument that the moderate desires of some must be
sacrificed to prevent abuse by others, 147 then concluded: </p>

<p>[The Act] is altogether too sweeping in its terms. I make no
question but that the habit of smoking opium may be repulsive and
degrading. That its effect would be to shatter the nerves and
destroy the intellect; and that it may tend to the increase of
pauperism and crime. But there is a vast difference between the
commission of a single act, and a confirmed habit. There is a
distinction to be recognized between the use and abuse of any
article or substance.... If this act must be held valid it is
hard to conceive of any legislative action affecting the personal
conduct, or privileges of the individual citizen. that must not
be upheld. . . . The prohibited act cannot affect the public in
any way except through the primary personal injury to the
individual, if it occasions him any injury. It looks like a new
and extreme step under our government in the field of
legislation, if it really was passed for any of the purposes upon
which that character of legislation can be sustained, if at all.
148 </p>

<p>The sanctity of &quot;the personal conduct or privileges of
the individual &quot; had suffered first blow. The knockout was
only a few citizen rounds away.<br>
</p>

<p>5. Phase Five: Prohibition of Possession of Alcohol After 1915
</p>

<p>The year 1915 was the watershed year for prohibitionists in
the courts. </p>

<p>By 1913, the tide had finally turned in the state
legislatures, many of which prohibited possession of more than a
certain quantity of alcoholic beverages. The first of these
statutes to reach the courts was that of Alabama in Southern
Express Co. v. Whittle.149 </p>

<p>Overruling its earlier decision in Eidge v. City of
Bessemer,150 one of the leading cases during the earlier phase,
the Alabama court swept away all restraints on the police power.
So long as the legislation was directed at some legitimate
purpose and was not arbitrary, the court should not interfere.151
Whether or not the Supreme Court had so intended, the Alabama
court, like other state courts, relied heavily on justice
Harlan's opinion in Mugler v. Kansas,152 and gave its legislature
a blank check when exercising police powers: </p>

<p>If the right of common law to manufacture an intoxicating
liquor for one's own personal use, out of one's own materials by
the application of one's own personal effort, may be forbidden by
appropriate legislation under the police power, as was expressly
ruled in Mugler v. Kansas . . . . it cannot be logically or
soundly asserted that the receipt or possession of more than a
specified quantity at one time may not be forbidden by a statute
. . . . 153 </p>

<p>The alleged sanctity of private conduct gave the court little
pause; this was just I one of a number of instances </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>where ancillary prohibitions of acts and conduct, innocent
    in themselves, have been sustained and confirmed as an
    exercise of the police power of the state; and so upon the
    theory that some valid legislative purpose might be more
    certainly made effective, or that evasions of the laws might
    be prevented or hindered of accomplishment.154 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Though the Alabama court did not do so, it could have cited
the opium possession cases as authority. Most courts did. </p>

<p>The Alabama decision was quickly followed in Idaho155 and in
nine other states.156 When the Idaho case, Crane v. Campbell,157
came before the Supreme Court, Justice McReynolds dealt the
knockout blow: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>As the state has the power . . . to prohibit [sale and
    manufacture], it may adopt such measures as are reasonably
    appropriate or needful to render exercise of that power
    effective. And, considering the notorious difficulties always
    attendant upon efforts to suppress traffic in liquors, we are
    unable to say that the challenged inhibition of their
    possession was 'arbitrary and unreasonable or without proper
    relation to the legitimate legislative purposes 158 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The principle noted by Freund,159 that the police power did
not easily extend to matters of private conduct, was ignored: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>[I] t clearly follows from our numerous decisions
    upholding prohibition legislation that the right to hold
    intoxicating liquors for personal use is not one of those
    fundamental privileges of a citizen of the United States
    which no State may abridge. A contrary view would be
    incompatible with the undoubted power to prevent manufacture,
    gift, sale, purchase or transportation of such articles-the
    only feasible ways of getting them. An assured right of
    possession would necessarily imply some adequate method to
    obtain not subject to destruction at the will of the State.
    160 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given the restrictive interpretation of the privileges and
immunities clause161 and the refusal to extend substantive due
process outside the economic area, 162 there was no existing
federal constitutional pigeonhole for &quot;private conduct&quot;
as a principle of constitutional limitation. And on the state
level the courts ignored the &quot;'intrinsic limitation&quot;
argument and discarded the direct-indirect yardstick in the wake
of the temperance movement. </p>

<p>The commentators were outraged. Again and again the courts
were indicted for interpreting constitutional precepts to
correspond with public opinion.163 The retreat on the temperance
question coincided perfectly with the final success of the
Prohibition movement. And the commentators were quite justified
in so noting. </p>

<p>It was merely icing on the cake when the Supreme Court upheld
the provision of the Volstead Act164 outlawing possession of
intoxicating liquor. The Court predictably rebuffed165 an
argument that it was beyond congressional power under section 2
of the eighteenth amendment to prohibit possession for personal
consumption of liquor owned before the passage of the Act.166 </p>

<p>6. A Postscript on the Police Power: The Cigarette Cases </p>

<p>Interestingly, the legislative solicitude for the health of
the citizenry during the period under discussion also extended to
the prohibition of cigarette smoking in several jurisdictions. In
1897, the General Assembly of Tennessee made it a misdemeanor to
sell, give away or otherwise dispose of cigarettes or cigarette
paper.167 The Supreme Court of Tennessee upheld the statute under
the police power on the grounds that cigarettes were not
legitimate articles of commerce, being &quot;inherently bad and
bad only.&quot; 168 The United States Supreme Court affirmed in
Austin v. Tennessee,169 primarily on the authority of the alcohol
and opium cases, noting that there need be only a rational basis
for the legislative determination that the commodity is harmful
to 'justify its prohibition.170 The Court did not even mention
any objection based on deprivation of property rights or personal
liberty. </p>

<p>The issue was posed more directly in Kentucky and Illinois
cases171 regarding the validity of local ordinances prohibiting
smoking of cigarettes &quot;within the corporate limits&quot; in
one case and &quot;in any street, alley, avenue ... park ... or
[other] public place&quot; in the other. Both courts held the
ordinances unreasonable interferences with personal liberty.172 </p>

<p>The argument that the ordinances were calculated to insure the
public safety by preventing fire hazards was held to be too
remote and the argument accepted in Austin regarding potential
injury to the smoker's health apparently was not made or at least
went unacknowledged by both courts. </p>

<p>These decisions, rendered in. 1911 and 1914, were probably
consistent, under a direct-indirect injury to society theory,
with Austin and with the alcohol and narcotics cases up to that
time. The post-1915 alcohol possession cases, however, undermined
any such distinction. insofar as it authorized a more active
judicial inquiry into the relationship between the private
conduct and the public need. At least at this stage of its
development it may be fruitless to seek out a &quot;neutral
principle&quot; beyond common sense regarding the undefined
constitutional limitations on the police power. Professor Brooks
Adams noted in 1913 that the scope of the police power could not
be determined in advance by abstract reasoning. Hence. as, each
litigation arose, the judges could follow no rule but the rule of
common sense, and the Police Power, translated into plain English
presently came to signify whatever, at the moment, the judges
happened to think reasonable. Consequently, they began guessing
at the drift of public opinion, as it percolated to them through
the medium of their education and prejudices. Sometimes they
guessed right and sometimes wrong, and when they guessed wrong
they were cast aside, as appeared dramatically enough in the
temperance agitation .173 </p>

<p>And justice Holmes noted: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It may be said in a general way that the police power
    extends to all the great public needs. It may be put forth in
    aid of what is sanctioned by usage, or held by the prevailing
    morality or strong and preponderant opinion to be greatly and
    immediately necessary to the public welfare.174 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whether the development of the Judicial response to exercises
of the police power at the time was the result of the changing
public opinion or a changing analytical framework, trends in that
response were evident. It remains to be seen whether any trends
are evident today to indicate how marijuana users will fare in
the future.<br>

<p>Even the advocates of prohibition concede that the state has
no concern with the private use of liquor. &quot;The opponents of
prohibition misstate the case by saying that the state has no
right to declare what a man shall cat or drink. The state does
not venture to make any such declaration.... It is not the
private appetite or home customs of the citizen that the state
undertakes to manage, but the liquor traffic. . . . If by
abolishing the saloon the state makes it difficult for men to
gratify their private appetites, there is no just reason for
complaint.&quot;<br>

<p>30 The earliest surveys employ a methodology much less
sophisticated than those conducted after 1914. The later studies,
however, suffer from a time lag which inevitably detracts from
accuracy. In any event, taken together, these surveys adequately
describe the contours of the phenomenon under consideration. </p>

<p>31 The earliest attempt at a compilation of addiction figures
was undertaken by O. Marshall in 1878. Marshall, The <i>Opium
Habit in Michigan, </i>1878 MICH. STATE BD. OF<br>
HEALTH ANN. REP. 61-73. From questionnaires sent to doctors,
Marshall found 1,313 users of opium or morphine and concluded
therefrom that there were 7,763 addicts in the state. Dr. Charles
Terry later concluded that, if Marshall's figures were
representative, total incidence of addiction in the United States
in 1878 was 251,936. C. TERRY &amp; M. PELLENS, THE OPIUM PROBLEM
15 (1928) [hereinafter cited as TERRY &amp; PELLENS]. Marshall
was unable fully to take into account the fact that the incidence
of drug abuse in the cities was much higher than that in the
rural areas he studied; accordingly, his figures probably
underestimate the extent of addiction in the state. </p>

<p>In a similar study of Iowa in 1884, J. M. Hull found 5,732
addicts which, if representative, would reflect a national addict
population of 182,215. Hull, <i>The Opium Habit, </i>1885 IOWA
STATE BD. OF HEALTH BIENNIAL REP. <i>535-45, quoted in </i>TERRY
&amp; PELLENs 16-18. </p>

<p>In 1900 the author of a Vermont study sent 130 questionnaires
to various druggists in an attempt to determine the monthly sales
of various drugs. His 116 replies indicate that 3,300,000 doses
of opium were sold every month, or enough for every person in
Vermont over the age of 21 to receive 11/2 doses per day.

<p>Perhaps the best pre-1914 estimate was made by Dr. Charles
Perry who, as Health Officer of Jacksonville, Florida, compiled
data for that city in 1913. He found that 541 persons, or .81% of
the city's population, used opium or some preparation thereof in
1913. Nationwide, this incidence would be 782,118. 1913

<p>A researcher in 1915 found 2,370 registered addicts in
Tennessee and put the national addict population at between
269,000 and 291,670. Brown, <i>Enforcement of the Tennessee
Anti-Narcotic Law, 5 </i>Am. J. PUB. HEALTH 323-33 (1915), <i>quoted

<p>The first post-Harrison Act study, and perhaps the most
reliable of all research during this period, was done by Lawrence
Kolb and A. G. DuMez of the United States Public Health Service.
Utilizing previously computed statistics together with
information regarding the supply of narcotics imported into the
United States, these authors concluded the addict population
never exceeded 246,000. KOLB &amp; DUMEz, THE PREVALENCE AND
TREND OF DRUG ADDICTION IN THE UNITED STATES AND FACTORS
INFLUENCING IT 1-20 (39 Public Health Reports No. 21) (May 23,

<p>At the same time the Narcotic Division of the Prohibition Unit
of the IRS estimated that there were more than 500,000 drug
addicts in America. Narcotic Division of the Prohibition Unit,

United States. A. Lindesmith, supra note 31, at 136, </p>

<p>72 The closing of the New York Clinic in 1919 was an
especially potent factor in promoting hysteria about heroin. More
than 7,400 addicts, about 90 percent Of whom were users of
heroin, were thrown on the streets of the city. Driven to commit
crimes, including those of narcotic violations, many of these
addicts were arrested. The increased number of arrests was widely
interpreted as an indication of moral deterioration due to
narcotics instead of evidence of maladministration of what could
have been a useful law. There were, of course, physicians who
dissented both as to the wisdom of closing the clinics and as to
the harmful effect of the drugs. Many of those who persisted in
helping their patients were arrested. Kolb, supra note 68, at 27.

Congress to exert a power not delegated, that is, the reserved
police power of the States.&quot; Id. at 95. It is interesting to

<p>76 justice McReynolds stated for the Court in Linder v. United

Government. Incidental regulation of such practice by Congress
through a taxing act cannot extend to matters plainly
inappropriate and unnecessary to reasonable enforcement of a
revenue measure. </p>

<p>The Court also held that the Harrison Act did not apply to
mere possession of opium. In reaching this conclusion the Court
pointed out that any congressional attempt to punish as a crime
possession of any article produced in a state would raise the

<p>90 Dissenting in People v. Gallagher, 4 Mich. 244 (1856),
justice Pratt noted' &quot;That intemperance is a great evil, no
sane man can doubt.&quot; Id. at 284. The Iowa court asserted: </p>

<p>There is no statistical or economical proposition better
established, nor one to which a more general assent is given by
reading and intelligent minds, than this, that the use of
intoxicating liquors as a drink, is the cause. of more want,
pauperism, suffering, crime and public expense, than any other
cause-and perhaps it should be said, than all other causes
combined. </p>

<p>Santo v. State, 2 Iowa 165, 190 (1855). </p>

<p>91 Dissenting in People v. Gallagher, 4 Mich. 244 (1856) ,
justice Pratt stated: &quot;Spiritous liquors are necessary in
the prosecution of many of the most valuable arts,' as well as
for mechanical, manufacturing and medicinal purposes.&quot; Id.
at 260. </p>

<p>92 The Indiana Court noted &quot;as a matter of general
knowledge . . . that the use of beer &amp;c. as a beverage, is
not necessarily hurtful, any more than the use of lemonade or ice
cream.... It is the abuse, and not the use, of all these
beverages that is hurtful.&quot; Beebe v. State, 6 Ind. 501,
519-20 (1855). </p>

<p>93 Justice Pratt reasoned: </p>

<p>Liquors, then, whether produced by fermentation or
distillation, do legally constitute property of use and value;
and the owner of this species of personal property, when lawfully
acquired, is, upon every principle, . . . entitled to the
possession and use of it. This legally includes the right of
keeping, selling or giving it away, as the owner may deem proper.
This is a natural primary right incident to ownership . . . . </p>

<p>People v. Gallagher, 4 Mich. 244, 263 (1856); accord,
Wynehamer v. People, 13 N.Y. 378, 396-98 (1856) (Comstock, J.). </p>

<p>94 Said the Indiana Court: </p>

<p>[T]he legislature enacted the law in question upon the
assumption that the manufacture and sale of beer . . . were
necessarily destructive to the community, and in acting upon that
assumption, in our judgment, has unwarrantably invaded the right
to private property, and its use as a beverage and article of
traffic. </p>

<p>. . . We repeat, the manufacture and sale and use of liquors
are not necessarily hurtful, and this the Court has a right to
judicially inquire into and act upon in deciding upon the
validity of the law in question-in deciding . . . whether it is
an indirect invasion of a right secured to the citizen by the
Constitution. Beebe v. State, 6 Ind. 501, 520-21 (1855) (emphasis
added). </p>

<p>95 In an opinion often cited as the first to invoke the
substantive construction of &quot;due process of law,&quot; judge
Comstock in Wynchamer v. People, 13 N.Y. 378, 392-93, 398 (1856),
stated: </p>

<p>To say that &quot;the law of the land&quot; or &quot;due
process of law&quot;, may mean the very act of legislation which
deprives the citizen of his rights, privileges or property, leads
to a simple absurdity. The Constitution would then mean, that no
person shall be deprived of his property or rights unless the
legislature shall pass a law to effectuate the wrong, and this
would be throwing the restraint entirely away. The true
interpretation of these constitutional phrases is, that where
rights are acquired by the citizen under existing law, there is
no power in any branch of the government to take them away. </p>

<p>When a law annihilates the value of property, and strips it of
its attributes, by which alone it is distinguished as property,
the owner is deprived of it according to the plainest
interpretation, and certainly within the spirit of a
constitutional provision intended expressly to shield private
rights from the exercise of arbitrary power. </p>

<p>96 The Indiana court held the prohibitionary legislation in
contravention of a provision in the state constitution declaring
that &quot;all men are endowed by their Creator with certain
inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness.&quot; Beebe v. State, 6 Ind. 501, 510
(1855). Dissenting in People v. Gall2gher, 4 Mich. 244, 258
(1856), Justice Pratt conducted an identical natural rights
inquiry without the benefit of Thomas Jefferson's penmanship. </p>

<p>107 In People v. Gallagher, 4 Mich. 244 (1856), the majority
stated: </p>

<p>The legislature has said that . . . no man shall sell liquors
to be used as a beverage, because by so doing, he inflicts injury
on the public; but, says the defendant, irrespective of the evil,
this right to sell liquors is a natural right, and you have no
power to pass a law infringing that right. How does he prove it?
Not by any adjudged cases; there are none, nor by anything in the
constitution preserving to him this right; but it is to be
determined by the nature and character of the right. . . . [The
manner in which the determination is to be made is] a question
very suitable and proper for the discussion and deliberation of a
legislative body, but one which cannot be entertained by this
court. </p>

<p>Id. at 257. judge Pratt replied: </p>

<p>If the doctrine is true that the legislature can, by the
exercise of an implied discretionary power, pass any law not
expressly inhibited by the constitution, then it is certain that
a hundred laws may be enacted by that body, invading directly
legitimate business pursuits, impairing and rendering worthless
trades and occupations, and destroying the substantial value of
private property, to the amount of millions of dollars. . . . But
who, I ask, believes that the legislature possesses the power, or
that the people, in their sovereignty, ever intended to confer on
that body such unlimited omnipotence? As appears to me, no man of
reason and reflection can believe it. </p>

<p>Id. at 277-79 (dissenting opinion). </p>

<p>108 Mere possession or consumption of alcohol was not
prohibited during this phase of temperance legislation. Many of
the courts were careful to allude to this feature and to note
that forfeiture could result only from illegal
possession-possession with intent to sell in violation of the
law. See, e.g., Santo v. State, 2 Iowa 165 (1855); Commonwealth
v. Kendall, 66 Mass. (12 Cush.) 414 (1853). </p>

<p>109 123 U.S. 623 (1887). </p>

<p>110 In Bartemeyer v. Iowa, 85 U.S. (18 Wall.) 129 (1873), the
Supreme Court held that the prohibition of traffic in
intoxicating drinks violates no privilege and immunity of United
States citizenship; the Court avoided the question whether a law
prohibiting sale of liquor owned before the law was passed was a
deprivation of property without due process. Four years later, in
Beer Co. v. Massachusetts, 97 U.S. 25 (1877), the Court sustained
a prohibition law against a challenge under the obligation of
contracts clauses but still deferred consideration of the
Wynehamer question. In upholding the seizure and forfeiture of
liquors belonging to the petitioner, justice Bradley stated: If
the public safety or the public morals require the discontinuance
of any manufacture or traffic, the hand of the legislature cannot
be stayed from providing for its discontinuance, by any
incidental inconvenience which individuals or corporations may
suffer. All rights are held subject to the police power of the
State. 97 U.S. at 32. </p>

<p>Finally, in Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U.S. 623 (1887), Wynebamer
was slain. The Court sustained a conviction for selling beer
manufactured before the passage of the law. The Court even held
that, in order to make effective its regulations against sale,
the State might forbid manufacture for personal use. Id. at 662.
The only constitutional inhibitions remaining after Mugler
emanated from the commerce power. For a discussion of the gradual
elimination of these restrictions by congressional action, see
Safely, Growth of State Power Under Federal Constitution to
Regulate Traffic in Intoxicating Liquors, 3 IOWA L. BuLL. 221,
229-34 (1917). </p>

<p>111 In Mugler, justice Harlan stated: </p>

<p>There is no justification for holding that the State, under
the guise merely of police regulations, is here aiming to deprive
the citizen of his constitutional rights. . . . If, therefore, a
state deems the absolute prohibition of the manufacture and sale,
within her limits, of intoxicating liquors for other than
medical, scientific, and manufacturing purposes, to be necessary
to the peace and security of society, the courts cannot, without
usurping legislative functions, override the will of the people
as thus expressed by their chosen representatives. They have
nothing to do with the mere policy of legislation. 123 U.S. at
662. </p>

<p>118 Ex parte Yung Jon, 28 F. 308, 311 (D. Ore. 1886). </p>

<p>119 Id. In defining property essentially in terms of habits of
the community, judge Deady was leaving room for the
&quot;natural&quot; rights argument with regard to alcohol and
tobacco: </p>

<p>True, we permit the indiscriminate use of alcohol and tobacco,
both of which are classed by science as poisons, and doubtless
destroy many lives annually. But the people of this country have
been accustomed to the manufacture and use of these for many
generations, and they are produced and possessed under the common
and long-standing impression that they are legitimate articles of
property, which the owner is entitled to dispose of without any
unusual restraint. . . . On the other hand, the use of opium,
otherwise than as this act allows, as a medicine, has but little,
if any, place in the experience or habits of the people of this
country, save among a few aliens. </p>

itself on grounds of the public welfare. </p>

<p>135 Similarly, in State v. Gilman, 33 W. Va. 146, 10 S.E. 283
(1889), the court stated: </p>

<p>It can hardly be questioned that the right to possess property
is [an inalienable] right, and that that right embraces the
privilege of a citizen to keep in his possession property for
another. It is not denied that the keeping of property which is
injurious to the lives, health, or comfort of all persons may be
prohibited under the police power. . . . [I]t must, of course, be
within the range of legislative action to define the mode and
manner in which every one may so use his own as not to injure
others. But it does not follow that every statute enacted
ostensibly for the promotion of these ends is to be accepted as a
legitimate exercise of the police Power of the State . . . . </p>

<p>The keeping of liquors in his possession by a person, whether
for himself or for another, unless he does so for the illegal
sale of it, or for some other improper purpose , can by no
possibility injure or affect the health, morals, or safety of the
public; and, therefore, the statute prohibiting such keeping in
possession is not a legitimate exertion of the police power. </p>

<p>Id. at 148-49, 10 S.E. it 284 (emphasis added); accord, Ex
parte Brown, 38 Tex. Crim. 795, 42 S.W. 554 (1897). </p>

<p>In Ex parte Wilson, 6 Okla. Crim. 451, 119 P. 596 (1911), the
Court, after quoting extensively from Commonwealth v. Campbell,
noted, &quot;The only conclusion that we can legitimately arrive
at is that the act in question is not within a reasonable
exercise of the police powers of the state-is unconstitutional
and void.&quot; 6 Okla. Crim. at 475, 119 P. at 606 (emphasis
added). Finally, the Alabama Supreme Court stated, in striking
down a local ordinance prohibiting possession by beverage dealers
of alcoholic beverages: </p>

<p>[The ordinance] can be justified only, if at all, on the
ground that it sustains some reasonable relation to the
prohibition law in the way of preventing evasions of that law by
trick, artifice, or subterfuge under guise of which that 12W is
violated. But it has no such relation. It undertakes to prohibit
the keeping if) any quantity and for any purpose, however
innocent, of intoxicating liquors and beverages in places which
are innocent in themselves. Eidge v. City of Bessemer, 164 Ala.
599, 606, 51 So. 246, 249 (1909). </p>

<p>136 Ex parte Yun Quong, 159 Cal. 508, 114 P. 835 (1911); Luck

<p>137 Ah Lim v. Territory, I Wash. 156, 163, 24 P. 588, 589
(1890). </p>

<p>138 If the state concludes that a given habit is detrimental
to either the moral, mental or physical well being of one of its
citizens to such an extent that it is liable to become a burthen
upon society, it has an undoubted right to restrain the citizen
from the commission of that act; and fair and equitable
consideration of the rights of other citizens make it not only
its right, but its duty, to restrain him. Id. at 164, 24 P. at
590; accord, Ex parte Yun Quong, 159 Cal. 508, 515, 114 P. 835,
837 (1911); Luck v. Sears, 29 Ore. 421, 426, 44 P. 693, 694

<p>140 But it is urged . . . that a moderate use of opium . . .
is not deleterious and consequently cannot be prohibited. We
answer that this is a question of fact which can only be inquired
into by the legislature. </p>

<p>170 The primary issue before the Court was whether the statute
infringed the exclusive power of Congress to regulate interstate
commerce. Id. at 344. However, before turning to the
&quot;original package&quot; questions, the Court first had to
conclude that the statute was a legitimate exercise of the police
power, for only then could an indirect interference with
interstate commerce be sustained. Id. at 349. The Court noted on
this point: </p>

<p>Cigarettes do not seem until recently to have attracted the
attention of the public as more injurious than other forms of
tobacco; nor are we now prepared to take judicial notice of any
special injury resulting from their use or to indorse the opinion
of the Supreme Court of Tennessee that &quot;they are inherently
bad and bad only.&quot; At the same time we should be shutting
our eyes to what is constantly passing before them were we to
affect an ignorance of the fact that a belief in their
deleterious effects, particularly upon young people, has become
very general and that communications are constantly finding their
way into the public press denouncing their use as fraught with
great danger to the youth of both sexes. Without undertaking to
affirm or deny their evil effects, we think it within the
province of the legislature to say how far they may be sold, or
to prohibit their sale entirely . . . provided . . . there be no
reason to doubt that the act in question is designed for the
protection of the public health. </p>

<p>Id. at 348-49; cf. Gundling City of Chicago, 177 U.S. 183
(1900) (affirming validity of licensing sale of cigarettes </p>

(1914); Hershberg v. City of Barbourville, 142 Ky. 60. 133 S.W.
985 (1911). <br>
</p>

<p>172 In the broad language in which the ordinance is enacted it
is apparently an attempt on the part of the municipality to
regulate and control the habits and practices of the citizen
without any reasonable basis for so doing. The ordinance is an
unreasonable interference with the private rights of the citizen
. . . . 262 Ill. at 513, 104 N.E. at 837-38. </p>

<p>The ordinance is so broad as to prohibit one from smoking a
cigarette in his own home or on any private premises in the city.
To prohibit the smoking of cigarettes in [such circumstances] is
an invasion of his right to control his own personal indulgences.
142 Ky. at 61, 133 S.W. at 986 (1911). By holding that the
ordinance applied in the home, the Kentucky court avoided the
question raised in the Illinois case. The reasoning would appear
to compel the same result, however. </p>

<p><b>THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT AND THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE: AN INQUIRY
INTO THE LEGAL HISTORY OF AMERICAN MARIJUANA PROHIBITION</b> </p>

<p><font size="5"><b>III. THE GENESIS OF MARIJUANA PROHIBITION</b></font>
</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Until the inclusion of marijuana in the Uniform Narcotic Drug
Act in 1932 and the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act in 1937,
there was no &quot;national&quot; public policy regarding the
drug. However, as early as 1914 the New York City Sanitary Laws
included cannabis in a prohibited drug list and in 1915 Utah
passed the first state statute prohibiting sale or possession of
the drug. By 1931 twenty-two states had enacted such legislation.
In the succeeding section, we shall delve into the circumstances
surrounding the passage of several of these early laws and the
ensuing judicial acquiescence in the legislative value judgments
concerning marijuana. We conclude that the legislative action and
approval were essentially kneejerk responses uninformed by
scientific study or public debate and colored instead by racial
bias and sensationalistic myths. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>A. Initial State Legislation 1914-1931</b> </p>

<p>As indicated above, the Harrison Act, a regulatory measure in
the garb of a taxing statute, left many gaps unfilled in the
effort to prohibit illegal or nonmedical use of opiates and
cocaine. Although Commissioner Anslinger of the Federal Bureau of
Narcotics stated in 1932 that few states had responded to the
Harrison Act,1 most states had in fact enacted or reenacted
narcotics laws in the period from 1914 to 1931.2 In so doing,
twenty-one states had also restricted the sale of marijuana as
part of their general narcotics articles, one state had
prohibited its use for any purpose, and four states had outlawed
its cultivation.3 Our objective in this section is to determine
why these states chose to include cannabis in their lists of
prohibited drugs. </p>

<p>The first consideration was the increasing public awareness of
the narcotics problem. As noted above, the Harrison Act
engendered a shift in public perception of the narcotics addict.
With ever-increasing frequency and venom, he was portrayed in the
public media as the criminal &quot;dope fiend.&quot; This
hysteria, coupled with the actual increases in drug-related
criminal conduct due to the closing of the clinics,4 was the
basis for a good many of the post-Harrison Act narcotic
statutes.5 Other forces such as lurid accounts in the media,6
publications of private narcotics associations 7 and the
effective separation of the addict and his problems from the
medical profession8 all pressed legislatures into action to deal
more effectively with what was perceived as a growing narcotics
problem. </p>

<p>Despite the increasing public interest in the narcotics
problem during this period, we can find no evidence of public
concern for, or understanding of, marijuana, even in those states
that banned it along with the opiates and cocaine. Observers in
the middle and late 1930's agreed that marijuana was at that time
a very new phenomenon on the national scene.9 The perplexing
question remains-why did some states include marijuana in their
prohibitive legislation a decade before it achieved any notice
whatsoever from the general public and the overwhelming majority
of legislators? </p>

<p>From a survey of contemporary newspaper and periodical
commentary we have concluded that there were three major
influences. The most prominent was racial prejudice. During this
period, marijuana legislation was generally a regional phenomenon
present in the southern and western states. Use of the drug was
primarily limited to Mexican-Americans who were immigrating in
increased numbers to those states. These movements were well
noted in the press accounts of passage of marijuana legislation.
A second factor was the assumption that marijuana, which was
presumed to be an addictive drug, would be utilized as a
substitute for narcotics and alcohol then prohibited by national
policy. This factor was particularly significant in the New York
law, the forerunner of nationwide anti-marijuana legislation.
Finally, there is some evidence that coverage of the drug by the
Geneva Conventions in 1925 was publicized in this country and may
have had some influence. </p>

<p><b>1. Rationale in the West: Class Legislation</b> </p>

<p>Geometric increases in Mexican immigration after the turn of
the century naturally resulted in the formation of sizeable
Mexican-American minorities in each western state.10 It was
thought then11 and is generally assumed now12 that use of
marijuana west of the Mississippi was limited primarily to the
Mexican segment of the population. We do not find it surprising,
therefore, that sixteen of these states prohibited sale or
possession of marijuana before 1930.13 Whether motivated by
outright prejudice or simple discriminatory disinterest, the
result was the same in each legislature-little if any public
attention, no debate, pointed references to the drug's Mexican
origins, and sometimes vociferous allusion to the criminal
conduct inevitably generated when Mexicans ate &quot;the killer
weed.&quot; </p>

<p>In Utah, for example, the nation's first statewide prohibition
of marijuana 14 in 1915 was attended by little publicity. The
combination of increasing Mexican immigration15 and the
traditional aversion of the Mormons to euphoriants of any kind16
led inevitably to the inclusion of marijuana in the state's
omnibus narcotics and pharmacy bill. Similarly, when the New
Mexico and Texas legislatures passed marijuana legislation in
1923, the former by separate statute17 and the latter by
inclusion,18 newspaper reference was minimal despite coverage in
both states of legislative action.19 The longest of the Santa Fe
New Mexican references noted: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The Santa Fe representative, however, had better luck with
    his bill to prevent sale of marihuana, cannabis indica,
    Indian hemp or hashish as it is variously known. This bill
    was passed without any opposition. Marihuana was brought into
    local prominence at the penitentiary board's investigation
    last summer when a convict testified he could get marihuana
    cigarets anytime he had a dollar. The drug produces
    intoxication when chewed or smoked. Marihuana is the name
    commonly used in the Southwest and Mexico.20 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In its only direct reference to marijuana, the Austin Texas
Statesman stated: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The McMillan Senate Bill amended the anti-narcotic law so
    as to make unlawful the possession for the purpose of sale of
    any marihuana or other drugs. Marihuana is a Mexican herb and
    is said to be sold on the Texas-Mexican border .21 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The discriminatory aspects of this early marijuana
legislation, suggested only obliquely by origin and apparent
disinterest in Utah, New Mexico and Texas, are directly confirmed
in Montana and Colorado. Montana newspapers gave relatively
&quot;full&quot; coverage to a proposal to exclude marijuana from
the general narcotics law and to create a separate marijuana
statute.22 On seven different days from January 14 to February
10, 1929 (the date of the bill's passage), the Montana Standard
succinctly noted the progress of the bill through the
legislature. The giveaway appeared on January 27 when the paper
recorded the following: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>There was fun in the House Health Committee during the
    week when the Marihuana bill came up for consideration.
    Marihuana is Mexican opium, a plant used by Mexicans and
    cultivated for sale by Indians. &quot;When some beet field
    peon takes a few rares of this stuff,&quot; explained Dr.
    Fred Fulsher of Mineral County, &quot;He thinks he has just
    been elected president of Mexico so he starts out to execute
    all his political enemies. I understand that over in Butte
    where the Mexicans often go for the winter they stage
    imaginary bullfights in the 'Bower of Roses' or put on
    tournaments for the favor of 'Spanish Rose' after a couple of
    whiffs of Marijuana. The Silver Bow and Yellowstone
    delegations both deplore these international
    complications&quot; Everybody laughed and the bill was
    recommended for passage.23 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same year, a change in Colorado's marijuana law was
precipitated by less comic apprehensions of the drug's evil
effects. On April 7, 1929, a girl was murdered by her Mexican
step-father. The story was lead news in the Denver Post every day
until April 16, probably because the girl's mother was white. On
the 16th it was first mentioned that this man might have been a
marijuana user. Headlined &quot;Fiend Slayer Caught in Nebraska
[;] Mexican Confesses Torture of American Baby,&quot; and
subheaded &quot;Prisoner Admits to Officer He is Marihuana
Addict,&quot; the story, relates in full the underlying events: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;You smoke marihuana?&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Yes &quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The Mexican said he had been without the weed for two days
    before the killing of his step-daughter .24 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>On April 17, the story on the Mexican included the following: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>He repeated the story he had told the Sidney Chief of
    Police regarding his addiction to marihuana saying that his
    supply of the weed had become exhausted several days before
    the killing and his nerves were unstrung.25 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>With regard to the legislative news there is no mention at any
time of a bill to regulate marijuana; however, on April 21, the
Denver Post noted the Governor had signed a bill increasing
penalties for sale, possession or production of marijuana.26 </p>

<p>The reader should note that public perception of marijuana's
ethnic origins and crime-producing tendencies often went hand in
hand, especially in the more volatile areas of the western
states. Stories such as the one appearing in the Denver Post,
where defendants charged with violent crimes attempted to blame
their actions on the effects of marijuana were primarily
responsible for the drug's characterization as a &quot;killer
weed.&quot; In any event, from this brief survey of marijuana
prohibition in the western states, we have concluded that its
Mexican use pattern was ordinarily enough to warrant its
prohibition, and that whatever attention such legislative action
received was attended by sensationalist descriptions of crimes
allegedly committed by Mexican marijuana users. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>2. Rationale in the East: Substitution</b> </p>

<p>The first significant27 instance of marijuana regulation
appeared in the 1914 amendments to the New York City Sanitary
Laws. The inclusion by the New York legislature of marijuana in
Its general narcotics statute in 1927 was the precursor of
nationwide legislation .28 For these reasons, we have chosen New
York as the most likely source of information regarding the.
rationale for marijuana prohibition in Maine, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Ohio, Rhode Island and Vermont, all of which had acted
before 1931.29 </p>

<p>In January 1914 the New York legislature passed its first
comprehensive statute-The Boylan Bill-regulating the sale and use
of habit forming drugs&quot;' and did not include marijuana among
its list of prohibited narcotics. It appears that the Board of
Health of New York City then amended its Sanitary Code adding
&quot;Cannabis indica, which is the Indian hemp from which the
East Indian drug called hashish is manufactured,&quot;31 to the
City's list of prohibited drugs. Violation of this provision of
the City Sanitary Code was a misdemeanor punishable by a small
fine and/or a jail term of up to six months. On July 29, 1914, an
article reporting the amendment appeared in the New York Times
wherein the drug was described: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This narcotic has practically the same effect as morphine
    and cocaine, but it was not used in this country to any
    extent while it was easy to get the more refined narcotics.32
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The next day the editors of the Times commented: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>[T]he inclusion of cannabis indica among the drugs to be
    sold only on prescription is only common sense. Devotees of
    hashish are now hardly numerous enough here to count, but
    they are likely to increase as other narcotics become harder
    to obtain.33 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>From these observations, it would appear (1) that there were
few marijuana users at the time; and (2) that use of the drug was
expected to increase as a direct result of the restriction of
opiates and cocaine. </p>

<p>Despite New York City's early classification of cannabis with
known narcotics, New York State did not prohibit sale and
possession of the drug for other than medicinal purposes until
1927.34 And this was true despite a great deal of activity on the
narcotics front from 1914 to 1927, when the legislature acted
four different times.35 Throughout all this tumult and in the
variety of narcotics proposals suggested or enacted,36 marijuana
or cannabis was not classified among the restricted drugs until
the drafting of the 1927 Act. This act37 defined cannabis as a
&quot;habit-forming drug,&quot; 38 and accordingly punished as
misdemeanors39 the control, sale, distribution, administration
and dispensing40 of cannabis except for medical purposes. The
penalty provision of the statute did not discriminate among types
of offenses, first or subsequent violations, or the prohibited
narcotic drugs.41 </p>

<p>There is no apparent indication in the contemporary commentary
of the reasons for inclusion of marijuana in the New York laws.
When the 1927 law was passed, public concern was focused on the
general need to reduce narcotic addiction; none of the
commentators were concerned about marijuana.42 While there were
numerous articles in the media dealing with the problems of the
opiates, morphine, cocaine and heroin, only four articles about
marijuana appeared in the major New York newspaper during the
entire period from 1914 until 1927. In 1923 the New York Times
noted that the &quot;latest habit forming drug ... marihuana,
which is smoked in a cigarette&quot; was exhibited at a women's
club meeting.43 In 1925 the same paper reported that the drug had
been banned in Mexico.44 One year later, the paper reported the
results of testing in Panama on the effects of marijuana. The
article noted that as a result of these tests the study group
concluded marijuana smoking was relatively safe; thus, it was
&quot;recommended that no steps be taken by the authorities of
the Canal Zone to prevent the sale or use of marijuana and that
no special legislation on that subject was needed.&quot; 45
Finally, in July 1927, the Times reported that a Mexican family
was said to have gone insane from eating marijuana.46 Perhaps the
clearest indication of the absence of notice given the marijuana
section of the 1927 Act is that none of the articles discussing
the Act after its passage refer to marijuana .47 </p>

<p>It is likely, then, that the inclusion of cannabis in the
state law was motivated primarily by the same fear that had
provoked the Sanitary Law Amendment in 1914. Use, though still
slight, was expected to increase. Throughout the entire New York
experience the main argument was preventive: Marijuana use must
be prohibited to keep addicts from switching to it as a
substitute for the drugs which had become much more difficult to
obtain after the enactment of the Harrison Act, and for alcohol
after Prohibition.48 Accordingly, the passage of the Harrison and
Volstead Acts were direct causes of the preventive inclusion of
marijuana among prohibited drugs. In fact, it has been observed
that marijuana use did increase during this period .49 </p>

<p>Another factor that may have influenced the passage of the
1927 Act was the Second Opium Conference at Geneva in 1925,50
which included Indian hemp within the Convention against Opium
and other Dangerous Drugs, even though the United States had
withdrawn in 1925 from the League of Nations deliberations on
controlling and regulating the international traffic in dangerous
drugs.51 </p>

<hr>

<p><b>3. The International Scene</b> </p>

<p>The first mention of marijuana on the international front came
with the preliminary negotiations for the Hague Conference of
1912. In preparing for this Conference, which represented an
attempt to deal with the international opium traffic, the
government of Italy proposed that the production and traffic in
Indian hemp drugs be included as part of the agenda of the
Conference.52 During the Conference itself, there was no mention
of the drug, and the Convention did not include cannabis in its
provisions. In addition to the Convention, however, the delegates
signed a closing protocol: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>2. The Conference considers it desirable to study the
    question of Indian hemp from the statistical and scientific
    point of view, with the object of regulating its abuses,
    should the necessity thereof be felt, by internal legislation
    or by an international agreement .53 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was not until just before the Geneva Conference of 1925
that the proposal was mentioned again. In 1923 the following
resolution was passed by the Advisory Committee on Traffic in
Opium and Other Dangerous Drugs of the League of Nations: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>IV. With reference to the proposal of the Government of
    the Union of South Africa that Indian hemp should be treated
    as one of the habit-forming drugs, the Advisory Committee
    recommends the Council that, in the first instance, the
    Governments should be invited to furnish to the League
    information as to the production and use of, and traffic in,
    this substance in their territories, together with their
    observations on the proposal of the Government of the Union
    of South Africa .54 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the 1925 meeting in Geneva, the Egyptians led the way in
proposing that hashish be included within the Convention.55 An
Egyptian delegate presented a paper on the effects and use of
hashish in Egypt. Mr. El Guindy's study is so typical of the
so-called scientific or empirical evidence that has been
presented to justify the drug's prohibition that the following
excerpt must be included. In stating that the real danger of
hashish is that it will produce insanity, the Egyptian delegate
presented the following: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The illicit use of hashish is the principal cause of most
    of the cases of insanity occurring in Egypt. In support of
    this contention, it may be observed that there are three
    times as many cases of mental alienation among men as among
    women, and it is an established fact that men are much more
    addicted to hashish than women.56 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Egyptian proposal was referred to a subcommittee for study
and later in the Conference this group reported that the use of
Indian hemp drugs should be limited to medical and scientific
purposes. The proceedings contain no record of what medical or
scientific evidence might have been brought forward to support
the inclusion of the Indian hemp drugs in the Convention.57
Nevertheless, they were the subject of Chapters IV and V of the
Convention.58 </p>

<hr>

<p><b>4. Conclusion</b> </p>

<p>The early laws against the cannabis drugs were passed with
little public attention. Concern about marijuana was related
primarily to the fear that marijuana use would spread, even among
whites, as a substitute for the opiates and alcohol made more
difficult to obtain by federal legislation. Especially in the
western states, this concern was identifiable with the growth of
the Mexican-American minority. It is clear that no state
undertook any empirical or scientific study of the effects of the
drug. Instead they relied on lurid and often unfounded accounts
of marijuana's dangers as presented in what little newspaper
coverage the drug received. It was simply assumed that cannabis
was addictive and would have engendered the same evil effects as
opium and cocaine. Apparently, legislators in these states found
it easy and uncontroversial to prohibit use of a drug they had
never seen or used and which was associated with ethnic
minorities and the lower class. </p>

<hr>

<p align="center"><b>B. Judicial Corroboration</b> </p>

<p>Two significant conclusions appear from a study of the few
cases59 involving convictions for marijuana offenses under the
initial wave of state laws. First, the argument regarding a
private conduct limitation on the police power had been so
discredited it was not even made. Second, the courts, like the
legislatures, relied on nonscientific materials to support the
proposition that marijuana was an addictive, mind-destroying drug
productive of crime and insanity. </p>

<p>In only one case was there a serious constitutional challenge
to the validity of the legislation. Appealing a Louisiana
conviction for possession of five hundred plants of marijuana,
the defendant in State v. Bonoa60 argued not that the state could
not punish mere possession but rather that the statute was
overbroad, since aside from its use as an intoxicant the
marijuana plant was employed in the manufacture of hemp line, in
the preparation of useful drugs and for the production of bird
seed for canaries. Defendant's contention was that only
possession, sale or use for deleterious purposes could be
prohibited. </p>

<p>The court's reply was that the drug's deleterious properties
outweighed its uses, especially since &quot; [t]he Marijuana
plant is not one of the crops of this state.&quot; 61 Defendant
also offered the reductio ad absurdum argument that if possession
of the marijuana plant may be prohibited simply because
intoxicating resin may be extracted from the flowering tops, then
the possession of corn or grapes may be prohibited because
whiskey and wine may be made from them, or possession of poppies
because opium may be extracted from them. To this the court
replied that alcohol was less injurious than marijuana and that
both alcohol and opium were difficult to prepare from these
sources while the marijuana plant was easily converted into
tobacco and cigarettes. </p>

<p>The court's reasoning is admirable if we accept the basic
premise that the marijuana drug is deleterious. To support this
conclusion the court quoted from Solis Cohen Githens'
Pharmacotheraupeutics: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The first symptom is usually an exaltation of the mind . .
    . . The ideas are joyous Sleep follows . . . . When aroused
    from sleep . . . the mind passes into the same somnolent
    condition, which lasts for several hours and is followed by a
    sense of weakness and extreme mental depression. In certain
    eastern people . . . perhaps because of continued use, the
    somnolent action is replaced by complete loss of judgment and
    restraint such as is seen more often from alcohol. An Arab
    leader, fighting against the crusaders, had a bodyguard who
    partook of haschisch, and used to rush madly on their
    enemies, slaying everyone they met. The name of
    &quot;haschischin&quot; applied to them has survived as
    &quot;assassin.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The habitual use of cannabis does not lead to much
    tolerance, nor do abstinence symptoms follow its withdrawal.
    It causes, however, a loss of mentality, resembling dementia,
    which can be recognized even in dogs.62 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The court also quotes Rusby, Bliss &amp; Ballard, The
Properties and Uses of Drugs: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The particular narcosis of cannabis consists in the
    liberation of the imagination from all restraint . . . . Not
    rarely, in [the depression] state, an irresistible impulse to
    the commission of criminal acts will be experienced.
    Occasionally an entire group of men under the influence of
    this drug will rush out to engage in violent or bloody
    deeds.63 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>On these two sources, the entire opinion stands. The allegedly
deleterious consequences-criminal activity and insanity-are
supported only by the mythical etymology of the word
&quot;assassin.&quot; The marijuana user's purported propensity
toward crime, based on similar and often weaker authority, was
the primary rationale underlying passage of the Marihuana Tax
Act.64 So preposterous is this assertion that even the proponents
of criminalization-including the Cormmissioner of the Bureau of
Narcotics-later implicitly rejected it.65 </p>

<p>In any event, the courts were as willing to accept such
evidence as the legislatures. In a Utah case, State v. Navaro,66
where the court cited the acknowledged evils of marijuana to
repel a vagueness attack,67 it relied on another set of dubious
authorities. First, the court referred to the case of State v.
Diaz68 wherein a defendant in a first degree murder prosecution
tried to disprove the requisite mens rea by showing that he was
under the influence of marijuana at the time of the offense. Diaz
had claimed that &quot;his mind was an entire blank as to all
that happened to him and stated that after smoking the marijuana
he became 'very crazy.' To corroborate his assertion, defendant
summoned a physician whose testimony was summarized in Diaz in a
passage quoted in full in Navaro: </p>

<p>He stated that [marijuana] is a narcotic and acts upon the
central nervous system affecting the brain, producing
exhilarating effects and causing one to do things which he
otherwise would not do and especially induces acts of violence;
that violence is one of the symptoms of an excessive use of
marijuana. That the marihuana produces an &quot;I don't
care&quot; effect. A man having used liquor and marihuana might
deliberately plan a robbery and killing and carry it out and
escape, and then later fail to remember anything that had
occurred. 70 </p>

<p>Thus an attempt in an adversary setting by an accused to
escape criminal responsibility by blaming his offense on
marijuana intoxication became medical authority for the
scientific hypothesis that marijuana use causes crime. </p>

<p>The second source of support in Navaro for the allegedly
deleterious effects of marijuana was a 1932 article by Hayes and
Bowery (the latter a member of the Wichita, Kansas, Police
Department) entitled Marihuana .71 Calling for stricter penalties
for marijuana use, the authors stated that during the
exhilaration phase, the user is likely to have increased sexual
desires72 and to commit &quot;actions of uncontrollable violence,
or even murder.&quot; 73 For these propositions, they cited
newspaper accounts of crimes the causes of which the reporter
attributed to marijuana74 and police testimony to the same
effect.75 For example, the Chief Detective of the Los Angeles
Police Department was quoted as saying: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In the past we have had officers of this department shot
    and killed by Marihuana addicts and <i>have traced the act of
    murder directly to the influence of Marihuana, with no other
    motive</i>. Numerous assaults have been made upon officers
    and citizens with intent to kill by Marihuana addicts which
    were directly traceable to the influence of Marihuana.76 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It should be noted that Hayes and Bowery attributed the
violent impulse to the absence of restraint engendered during the
so-called exhilaration phase, while each of the authorities cited
by the Louisiana court in Bonoa attributed the same impulse to
the sufferings experienced during the &quot;depression&quot;
phase.77 </p>

<p>The authors also asserted that habitual use leads to a
&quot;loss of mental activity, accompanied by a general dullness
and indolence, like that of chronic alcoholics or opium
caters,&quot; to &quot;destruction of brain tissues&quot; and
inevitably to insanity. For this proposition, the authors merely
said that &quot;seventeen to twenty per cent of all males
admitted to mental hospitals and asylums in India have become
insane through the use of this drug.&quot;78 </p>

<p>Finally the court cited an article by Eugene Stanley, the
District Attorney of New Orleans, entitled Marihuana as a
Developer of Crimiinals.79 The title conveys the message. We will
return to Mr. Stanley in the succeeding section.80 </p>

<p>The nonchalance with which Utah and Louisiana courts cited
sensationalistic, nonscientific sources to support the
proposition that marijuana produced crime and insanity suggests
how widely accepted this hypothesis was among decision-makers,
both judicial and legislative, prior to 1931. Given the
prevalence of this attitude, the noninvolvement of the middle
class, and the precedent established in the earlier alcohol and
narcotics cases, it is not surprising that constitutional
challenges were either not made or easily rebuffed. Nor is it
surprising that challenges regarding the ambiguity of the word
&quot;marijuana&quot; were unsuccessful.81 The courts, like the
legislatures, assumed marijuana caused crime and insanity, and
assumed that had public opinion crystallized on the question, it
would have favored the suppression of a drug with such evil
effects.<br>

<p>9 Hearing on H.R. 6385 Before the House Comm. on Ways and
Means, 75th Cong, 1st Sess. 20 (1937) [hereinafter cited as Tax
Act Hearings]. </p>

<p>10 The Bureau of Immigration recorded the entry of 590,765
Mexicans into the United States between 1915 and 1930. Of these,
upwards of 90% in each year were to be resident in the 22 states
west of the Mississippi, and more than two-thirds were to reside
in Texas alone. Information compiled from Tables, Immigrant
Aliens, By States of Intended Future Residence and Race or

<p>14 At its 1915 session, the Utah legislature passed an omnibus
narcotics and pharmacy bill which included under it the cannabis
drugs. Ch. 66,  7, 8, [1915] Utah Laws 77. The law forbade
sale and possession of the named drugs, and provided for medical
use under a system of prescriptions and order blanks.
Interestingly, clinical treatment of addicts was allowed. Id. at
77-80. The law also prohibited possession of opium and marijuana
pipes. Id. at 80. Violations were misdemeanors punishable by
fines and/or imprisonment for terms up to six months, but third
offenders faced prison terms from one to five years. The statute
made no distinction between sale and possession, nor among the
various drugs. The law was revised in 1927. Ch. 65, [1927]1 Utah
Laws 107. </p>

<p>15 See note 10 supra. </p>

<p>16 See THE DOCTRINE AND COVENANTS OF THE CHURCH OF JESUS
CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS, CONTAINING THE REVELATIONS GIVEN TO
JOSEPH SMITH, THE PROPHET  89, at 154 (192 1) (PP, P 5, 7, wine
or strong drink) (P 8, tobacco) (P 9, hot drinks) (revelations
given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio,
February, 27, 1833, known as the Word of Wisdom). </p>

<p>17 The statute made importation of cannabis illegal and
established a presumption of importation whenever a person was
found to possess the drug. Ch. 42,   1-2, [1923] N.M. Laws
58-59. Violations were punishable by fine and/or imprisonment
from one to three years. Cultivation, sale or giving away
cannabis except for use by physicians and pharmacists was also
prohibited, and violations were punishable on first offense by
one to three years in prison and on subsequent offenses by three
to five years imprisonment. Id.  3, 4. </p>

<p>18 The Texas general narcotics statute, ch. 150, [1919] Tex.
Gen. Laws 277-79, as amended, ch. 61, [1919] Tex. Special Sess.
Laws 156-57, similar in format to the Utah statute and the
Harrison Act, included &quot;any drug or preparation known or
sold under the Spanish name of 'Marihuana........... Id. at 278.
Unlike the Utah and New Mexico statutes, Texas prohibited only
selling, furnishing or giving away marijuana. Except for the
exempted medical purposes, such divestment of any of the listed
narcotics could have resulted in a fine and/or imprisonment from
one month to one year. Id. at 279. </p>

<p>19 The Santa Fe New Mexican, hometown paper of the bill's
sponsor, made only one mention of marijuana at the time of
passage, and that was to note that the drug was being smuggled
into the state prisons. Santa Fe New Mexican, Feb. 1, 1923. </p>

<p>The Austin Texas Statesman gave heavy coverage to legislative
news at this time because the legislature was in special session
called by the Governor to deal with a budgetary problem. </p>

<p>20 Santa Fe New Mexican, Jan. 31, 1923. The statute was passed
on February 27, 1923; during the period from January 20 to
February 28, there were only three other references to marijuana.
The newspaper first noted the bill in a one sentence report that
a ban on sale of marijuana was to be discussed. Id., Jan. 20,
1923. Finally, in articles entitled &quot;A Day In The
Legislature,&quot; the progress of the bill (H.B. 56) was noted
on February 21 and 27 in simple lists of bills enacted. Id., Feb.
21, 27, 1923. So inconsequential was the bill that it was not
even mentioned in two stories describing the activities of the
legislature for that session. Id., Feb. 27, 1923, at 1, col. 1. </p>

<p>21 Austin Texas Statesman, June 19, 1923. Despite heavy
coverage of legislative news and of narcotics generally, the El
Paso Times made no reference to marijuana between June 10 and
June 25. The Texas Statesman mentioned the &quot;McMillan
Bill&quot; only two other times, each time without direct
reference to marijuana. </p>

<p>22 Unlike most states that passed laws early in the 1920's
against marijuana use, Montana in 1927 passed a statute which
merely amended the first section of its general narcotic law,
Rev. Code of Mont. ch. 227, S 3186 (1921), to include marijuana.
Ch. 91,  1, [ 1927] Mont. Laws 324. The new law, ch. 6, [1929]
Mont. Laws 5, made use, sale or possession without a prescription
a misdemeanor. </p>

<p>23 The Montana Standard, Jan. 27, 1929, at 3, col. 2. 24
Denver Post, April 16, 1929, at 2, col. 1. </p>

<p>25 Id., April 17,1929, at 2, col. 1. </p>

<p>26 Id., April 21, 1929. Ch. 95, (1927] Colo. Laws 309,
penalized possession, sale, gift, or cultivation of any of the
cannabis drugs as a misdemeanor. Offenses carried a fine and/or
imprisonment in the county jail for not less than one or more
than six months. The new law, ch. 93, [1929] Colo. Laws 331,
increased the penalties for second offenders to one to five year
terms in the penitentiary. </p>

<p>27 Although Commissioner Anslinger stated in the 1937 Tax Act
Hearings that the District of Columbia had no law regulating
marijuana, Dr. Woodward of the AMA refuted the Commissioner's
statement by citing a 1906 provision which limited the sale of
cannabis to pharmacists and regulated sale of the drug by such
pharmacists to the public. Tax Act Hearings 92-93. The D.C.
provision, Act of May 7, 1906, ch. 2084,  13, 34 Star. 175, is
typical of early attempts to deal with the drug under the general
poison laws, but it is noteworthy in its treatment of marijuana
separately from opiates. </p>

<p>28 See pp. 10 30-3 3 infra. </p>

<p>29 In 1913, Maine prohibited the sale of cannabis indica
without a prescription. STATE LAWS 137. Massachusetts passed a
similar law in 1917, id. at 150, and Michigan forbade possession
in 1929, id. at 161. A 1923 Ohio law prohibited sale or
possession with intent to sell, id. at 242; Rhode Island
prohibited sale in 1918, id. at 263; and Vermont barred sale
without a prescription in 1915, id. at 296. </p>

<p>31 Ch. 363, [1914] N.Y. Laws 1120. The first narcotics
legislation in New York was enacted in 1893. Ch. 661, art. XII,
208, 11893] N.Y. Laws 1561. The 1893 law provided that no
prescription containing opium, morphine, cocaine or chloral could
be filled more than once. Two years later, the legislature
enacted a provision requiring that the effect of narcotics on the
human system be taught in the public schools. Ch. 1041, 1,
[18951 N.Y. Laws 972. In 1897, a law was passed making it a
felony to possess any narcotic &quot;with intent to administer
the same or cause the same to be administered to another&quot;
without his consent. Ch. 42,  1, [1897] N.Y. Laws 21. The first
provision aimed at the sale of narcotics was passed in 1907 and
provided that the sale or distribution of cocaine without a
prescription was unlawful. Ch. 424, @ 1, [ 1907] N.Y. Laws 879.
This provision was subsequently amended to provide for the
keeping of records of sales and of transactions between dealers.
Ch. 470,  2, [1913] N.Y. Laws 984; ch. 131,  1, [1910] N.Y.
Laws 231; ch. 277,  1, [1908] N.Y. Laws 764. </p>

<p>33 Id., July 30, 1914, at 8, col. 4. </p>

<p>34 Ch. 672, [1927] N.Y. Laws 1695-1703. </p>

<p>35 The 1914 act was amended by the Whitney Act in 1918 which
also provided for the repeal of the 1914 act. Ch. 639, [1918]
N.Y. Laws 2026. In 1921 an act was passed that in effect repealed
all the legislation relating to the narcotics problem. Ch. 708,
[1921] N.Y. Laws 2496. The measure made no provision for other
laws on the subject. This surprising move was made in the
interests of economy, N.Y. Times, Jan. 6, 1921, at 1, col. 8, and
with the belief that the drug problem could be better handled by
local authorities working in concert with federal agencies. See
id., Jan. 9, 1921, S 2, at 1, col. 7; id., May 22, 1921, S 2, at
11, col. 3, An act making illegal the sale of cocaine without a
prescription was enacted in 1923. Ch. 130, [1923] N.Y. Laws 160.
The possession of opium or cocaine without a prescription was
outlawed in 1926. Ch. 650,  2, [1926] N.Y. Laws 1198. </p>

<p>36 As late as 1918, a legislative committee that had
exhaustively studied the narcotics problem in New York did not
mention the use of marijuana and concluded: &quot;The drugs which
are the sources of the difficulty are cocaine and eucaine with
their salts and derivatives and opium and its derivatives,
codeine, morphine and heroin.&quot; JOINT LEGISLATIVE COMM. TO
INVESTIGATE THE LAWS IN RELATION TO THE DISTRIBUTION AND SALE OF
NARCOTIC DRUGS, FINAL REPORT, NEW YORK SENATE Doc. No. 35 (1918).
quoted in TERRY &amp; PELLENs 833. </p>

<p>37 The Act of April 5, 1927, repealed both the 1923 and 1926
laws and replaced them with a comprehensive narcotic control
scheme. Ch. 672, [1927] N.Y. Laws 1695. This act contained
provisions relating to the control and use of narcotic drugs and
treatment of addicts; it also exempted certain preparations from
its coverage. The act furnished the model for the Uniform
Narcotic Drug Act. See pp. 1030-31 infra. </p>

<p>Subsequently, in 1929, unlawful sale of narcotics was made a
felony and all other violations of the 1927 act were made
misdemeanors. Ch. 377, [19291 N.Y. Laws 881. </p>

similar argument was made with respect to cocaine: </p>

<p>Cocaine in particular is greatly in demand. When prohibition
is in force, persons, especially drinkers from compulsion of
habit who have been robbed of their daily drink, will naturally
resort to cocaine . . . . </p>

<p>49 B. RENBORG, INTERNATIONAL DRUG CONTROL 216 (1947): </p>

<p>As the campaign against the illicit traffic in opium,
morphine, and cocaine drugs made progress and gradually resulted
in diminution of the supplies on the illicit market, a marked
increase in the illicit traffic and the use of Indian hemp drugs
was noticed. more particularly on the North American Continent
(the problem of marihuana) and in Egypt (the hashish problem). </p>

<p>67 Appellant, convicted on an information charging
&quot;possession of marijuana,&quot; contended that the statue
prohibited only possession of the flowering tops and leaves of
the marijuana plant. The court held that marijuana was the
popular name for the drug, not just the plant, and that the
information accordingly charged an offense. For this proposition,
it cited dictionaries, other state statutes, articles, cases and
texts. It is the court's familiarity with the articles describing
the allegedly evil effects of the drug with which we are
concerned. </p>

The Texas court was somewhat stricter in a series of cases
charging simply sale or possession of &quot;narcotic drugs&quot;
without specifying marijuana. On the same day, the court reversed
convictions in Baker v. State, 123 Tex. Crim. 209. 58 S.W.2d 534
(1933) (possession); Baker v. State, 123 Tex. Crim. 212, 58

Tex. Crim. 237, 58 S.W.2d 833, (1933) (possession). On the other
hand the Court held that an indictment charging &quot;possession
of marijuana&quot; is sufficient even though it does not allege
that marijuana is a narcotic drug. Santos v. State 122 Tex. Crim.
69, 53 S.W.2d 609 (1932).<br>

<p><b>THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT AND THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE: AN INQUIRY
INTO THE LEGAL HISTORY OF AMERICAN MARIJUANA PROHIBITION</b> </p>

<p><font size="2"><i>Richard J. Bonnie &amp; Charles H.
Whitebread, II</i></font> </p>

<p><b>IV. PASSAGE OF THE UNIFORM NARCOTIC DRUG ACT: </b></p>

<p><b>1927-1937</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>Our conclusions to this point bear summarization. During the
first two decades of the twentieth century, state as well as
national policy was steadfastly opposed to manufacture, sale and
consumption of narcotics and alcohol except for medical purposes.
Constitutional objections ions were uniformly ignored, in the
narcotics cases primarily because the nexus between the private
conduct and public harm was in fact a close one, and in the
alcohol cases primarily because the legislation was in response
to full operation of the public opinion process, to which the
courts were willing to defer. </p>

<p>We have also found that public opinion had not crystallized
against intoxicants generally, although public policy was moving
rapidly in that direction. Ultimately, the mere existence of that
public policy even in the form of criminal law-was not sufficient
to convert a public antipathy toward the evils of commercial
alcohol traffic into opposition to moderate use of alcohol. On
the question of private use, the public policy was unenforceable
and eventually abandoned. However, with respect to narcotics, the
public policy, also expressed through the criminal law,
effectively converted narcotics use, in the public view, from a
medical problem to a legal-moral problem. Sympathy for
unfortunate victims turned into moral indictment. Because other
laws and medical advances had reduced the number of accidental
addicts, the number of addicts decreased; in this sense the
public policy was successful. However, to the extent that this
police, effectively ostracized a group of users from the rest of
society, drove them to criminal activity to sustain their habit,
and engendered a moralistic public image, the stage was set for
many ensuing problems the consequences of which have only
recently become matters of public debate. </p>

<p>Ancillary to these developments during this period was the
classification of marijuana in some half the states as an
addictive drug that produced the same evils as the opiates and
cocaine--crime, pauperism and insanity. The users, few in number,
were primarily Mexicans. But as Mexican immigration increased and
the legitimate supply of narcotics and alcohol disappeared, a
fear developed, particularly in the western states, that
marijuana use would increase, particularly among the white youth.
As a result, some twenty-two states restricted marijuana use to
medical channels. The private conduct objection having
evaporated, the courts uncritically affirmed the legislative
classification, accepting on faith nonscientific opinion that
marijuana was a &quot;killer weed.&quot; </p>

<p>Even though the public opinion process did not operate on the
issue during this period, the decision-makers in all probability
thought that their actions comported with latent public
attitudes. If indeed marijuana caused crime and insanity, of
course the public would oppose its use, as it presumably did use
of opium and cocaine. Because the users were few in number and
confined primarily to a suppressed social and economic minority,
there was no voice which could be beard to challenge these
assumptions. To put it another way, the middle class had
successfully frustrated alcohol prohibition because the public
opinion process came to reflect its view that the law should not
condemn intoxication. Yet because marijuana use was primarily a
lower class phenomenon, the middle class was generally unaware of
the proposed legislation. </p>

<p>The public opinion process did not operate and decision-makers
remained uninformed about the drug. Quickly and with neither
consideration nor dissent, the laws were enacted, thus
establishing a deliberative format followed often in the
succeeding debates. </p>

<p>Although the groundwork had been laid, denigration of the
&quot;loco-weed&quot; was primarily a regional phenomenon until
1932. Nationalization ensued in two fell swoops in the 1930's.
First, cannabis was included in an optional provision of the
Uniform Narcotic Drug Act proposed in 1932. Second, Congress
enacted the Marihuana Tax Act in 1937. In the following sections
we shall scrutinize these two watershed developments. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>A. Origins of the Uniform Law</b> </p>

<p>As we have suggested, the Harrison Act's masquerade as a
revenue measure required residual state legislation in order to
effectuate full prohibition of the narcotics trade in America.1
After its passage most states obediently marched to the tune
played in Washington. By 1931 every state had restricted the sale
of cocaine and, with the exception of two, the opiates.2
Thirty-six states had enacted legislation prohibiting
unauthorized possession of cocaine3 and thirty-five prohibited
unauthorized possession of the opiates and other restricted
drugs.4 Eight states also prohibited possession of hypodermic
syringes.5 Perhaps the most significant feature of the state
response to the Harrison Act was the sharp increase in penalties
between 1914 and 1931.6 Even those penalties, however, seem light
in comparison with the current penalties.7 </p>

<p>On the other hand, some influential legislators thought that
the Federal Act was sufficient to deal with the problem.8 And
there was a considerable lack of uniformity regarding the
offenses prohibited and the penalties imposed by the several
states. Finally, there was little attention devoted to
development of enforcement patterns within and among the states.9
</p>

<p>With such a variety of state legislation, it is not surprising
that little data is available on the enforcement of these laws.
Since the Uniform Crime Statistics, currently the most reliable
source for enforcement data, were first compiled in 1932, there
are no figures on the number of drug arrests by state authorities
in the 1920's. One commentator asserts: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>As of June 30, 1928, of the 7738 prisoners in federal
    penitentiaries, 2529 were sentenced for narcotics offenses,
    1156 for prohibition law violations, and 1148 for
    stolen-vehicle transactions. Data are not available for
    approximately the same number in state institutions at this
    time.10 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite the significant degree of federal enforcement activity
evidenced by the above data, state law enforcement agencies
seldom involved themselves with narcotics.11 Perhaps the best
evidence of the lax enforcement of state narcotic laws from 1914
to 1927 is the 1921 call for more effective enforcement of the
1917 Massachusetts anti-narcotic law by the Medical Director of
the Boston Municipal Court: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Our laws aiming at the suppression of morphinism could
    perhaps be better, but, no matter whether they be improved or
    not, they will not have their maximal efficiency without
    adequate appropriations for their enforcement. Even with the
    insufficient funds now available, more could be reached. I
    understand, for instance, that there is no special police
    force (white squads) entrusted with the detection and arrest
    of cases of V.D.L. [Violation of the Drug Law.] and that
    officers are very much hankered by not being allowed to
    follow suspected persons outside their particular
    districts.12 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The general lack of uniformity in anti-narcotic legislation,13
the weakness of state enforcement procedures, 14 and the growing
hysteria about dope fiends and criminality15 converged in several
requests beginning as early as 1927 for a uniform state narcotic
law.16 </p>

<p>The drafting process of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act must
also be viewed against the backdrop of two larger movements: </p>

<p>(1) the trend toward the creation and dissemination of uniform
state laws by the National Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, a
group to which each state sent two representatives appointed by
the governor; and </p>

<p>(2) the general concern in the late 20's and early 30's about
controlling interstate crime, manifested, for example, in the
creation of the nearly autonomous Federal Bureau of Investigation
in 1930. </p>

<p>Because the concepts of states rights and narrowly construed
federal power held shelf sway in this period, appeal to the
National Commissioners was the inevitable recourse for those
pressing for uniform and-narcotic regulations. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>B. Drafting the Law</b> </p>

<p>A committee of Commissioners in conjunction with Dr. William
C. Woodward, Executive Secretary of the Bureau of Legal Medicine
and Legislation of the American Medical Association, prepared and
submitted at the 1925 meeting of the Commissioners the First
Tentative Draft.17 The Committee report stated: &quot;It occurs
to your committee that the New York Act should be taken as a
basis for framing a Uniform Act, and the draft submitted herewith
is largely a copy of the New York Act.&quot; 18 It appears that
the First Draft was drawn up by the Chairman of the Committee
alone.19 It was never presented on the floor of the full meeting
but was recommitted for further study. 20 The First Draft
included the following definitions: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>(12) &quot;Cannabis indica&quot; or &quot;cannabis
    sativa&quot; shall include any compound, manufacture, salt,
    derivative or preparation thereof and any synthetic
    substitute for any of them identical in chemical composition.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>(13) &quot;Habit forming drugs&quot; shall mean coca
    leaves, opium, cannabis indica or cannabis sativa.21 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nowhere in the Committee report or in the Proceedings does
there appear an explanation of the inclusion of cannabis under
the prohibited or regulated drugs. </p>

<p>The Second Tentative Draft was presented in 1928,22 and again
the draft was not discussed at the Conference but recommitted for
further study.23 The Second Draft was an exact copy of the 1927
New York statute.24 It retained cannabis in the class of
&quot;habit forming drugs .&quot; 25 The lack of concern on the
part of the Commissioners themselves for the whole narcotics
matter is reflected in the remarks of the President of the
Conference in introducing a brief statement to the Conference by
Dr. Woodward: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>President Miller: In view of the importance of the act I
    think it would not be amiss to listen to the Doctor for a few
    minutes, that he may point out to us why it is important. In
    some of the states we do not recognize the importance because
    it has not been called to our attention.26 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Moreover, the statements of Dr. Woodward point out that one of
the major forces supporting the drafting of the Uniform Act was
the AMA. The doctors not only wanted to protect the public from
drug addiction but also sought uniformity among state laws
&quot;in order that the profession may have a better
understanding of its obligations and duties and of its rights in
the use of narcotic drugs. &quot; 27 </p>

<p>Two Third Drafts were submitted. The initial one closely
resembled the first two Tentative Drafts and was presented in
1929.28 Again, it was recommitted for further study.29 The second
Third Tentative Draft30 was the first to remove cannabis from the
definition of &quot;habit forming drugs&quot; and to include only
a supplemental provision for dealing with the drug.31 The
explanation for this change from the first two drafts is
contained in this note following the supplemental section: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Note: Because of the many objections raised to the
    inclusion of cannabis indica, cannabis americana and cannabis
    sativa in the general list of habit-forming drugs, no mention
    is made of them in other sections of this act. The foregoing
    section is presented in order to meet an apparent demand for
    some method of preventing the use of such drugs for the
    production and maintenance of undesirable drug addiction. It
    may be adopted or rejected, as each state sees fit, without
    affecting the rest of the act.32 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Judge Deering, the Chairman of the Committee on the Uniform
Narcotic Drug Act, recommended recommission for further study
because the committee had not yet had a chance to consult with
the newly created Bureau of Narcotics. At the time of this
conference (August 14, 1930) no one had yet been appointed to
fill the office of Commissioner of the Bureau.33 </p>

<p>After receiving suggestions from the newly appointed
Commissioner Anslinger, the Committee presented a Fourth
Tentative Draft to the national conference in September 1931.34
The section dealing with marijuana was identical to that included
in the 1930 revised version of the Third Tentative Draft.35 The
national conference directed the Committee to return the next
year with a Fifth Tentative or Final Draft:36 </p>

<p>The Fifth-and final-Tentative Draft was adopted by the
National Conference of Commissioners on October 8, 1932.37 There
were some major changes in the Uniform Act between the Fourth and
the Fifth Tentative Drafts with regard to the regulation of
marijuana. Although the marijuana provisions remained
supplemental to the main body of the Act, any state wishing to
regulate sale and possession of marijuana was instructed to
simply add cannabis to the definition of &quot;narcotic
drugs,&quot; in which case all the other provisions of the Act
would apply to marijuana as well as the opiates and cocaine.38 It
appears that the change from a supplemental section to a series
of amendments to the relevant sections of the Act was preferred
by the Narcotics Bureau.39 The only opposition to adoption of the
Final Draft came from some Commissioners who objected to tying
the uniform state law to the terms of the Federal Harrison Act.40
This last obstacle to adoption of the Act was overcome by the
argument that a number of states had already passed such
legislation so that the federalism problem should not stand in
the way; the Act was adopted 26-3.41 These floor arguments at the
national conference are a most important indication that no one
challenged or even brought up the issue of the designations of
the drugs to be prohibited. Moreover, this brief debate confirms
the notion that the Act received very little attention of any of
the Commissioners other than those sitting on the committee that
drafted it.42 </p>

<p>Examination of the annual proceedings of the Commissioners
immediately suggests several conclusions about the drafting and
proposal of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act. (1) It was drafted in
conjunction with the American Medical Association and, after
1930, Commissioner Anslinger of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics.
(2) It was not one of the more controversial uniform laws and it
was given little consideration during the full meetings of the
Commissioners. (3) Impetus for the legislation, especially the
optional marijuana provisions, came from the Bureau of Narcotics
itself. (4) No scientific study of any kind was undertaken before
the optional marijuana section was proposed. (5)The first three
tentative drafts included marijuana within the general part of
the Act while the last two (including the one finally adopted by
the Commissioners) made marijuana the subject of a separate,
optional provision. (6) The model for all the drafts of the
Uniform Act was the 1927 New York State statute. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>C. Passage of the State Laws</b> </p>

<p>By 1937 every state had enacted some form of legislation
relating to marijuana, and thirty-five had enacted the Uniform
Act.43 The process by which a previously regional phenomenon
became nationwide closely parallels that which characterized the
earlier state-by-state developments. The major difference is that
the Bureau of Narcotics sought to insure passage of the Act in
each state through lobbying and testifying before the
legislatures and by propagandizing in channels of public opinion.
The Bureau's role has been overstated, however. The same factors
that combined to produce the earlier legislation were exacerbated
during the nationalization period, 1932-1937, and the legislation
probably would have passed just as easily without the efforts of
the Bureau. </p>

<p>Use of the drug was still slight and confined to
underprivileged or fringe groups who had no access either to
public opinion or to the legislators. The middle class had little
knowledge and even less interest in the drug and the legislation.
Passage of the Act in each state was attended by little
publicity, no scientific study and even more blatant ethnic
aspersions than the earlier laws. In short, the laws went
unnoticed by legal commentators, the press and the public at
large, despite the propagandizing efforts of the Bureau of
Narcotics. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>1. Use Patterns and Public Knowledge: 1931-1937</b> </p>

<p>As we noted earlier, marijuana use began in this country in
states near the Mexican border,44 &quot;marijuana&quot; in fact
being a Mexican label for the cannabis drug. Throughout the
1920's marijuana use was confined primarily to the
Mexican-American community; however, by the late 20's use of this
drug had spread to many of the larger cities and had become quite
popular among some elements in the Black ghettoes .45 jazz
musicians, dancers and others found the drug a cheap and readily
available euphoriant.46 </p>

<p>Nevertheless, use still remained slight even in 1934.
Commissioner Anslinger himself asserted in 1937: &quot;Ten years
ago we only heard about it [marijuana] throughout the Southwest .
. . . [I]t has only become a national menace in the last 3
years.&quot; 47 Still another commentator has written: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Only in the 1920's was there any significant usage even by
    the Mexican-American communities in border cities, and only
    in the mid and late 1920's did Negro, jazz musicians and
    &quot;degenerate&quot; bohemian sub-cultures start smoking
    marijuana. Even the most lurid Journalists did not claim
    marijuana &quot;seeped&quot; into society at large until the
    1930's and usually the mid-30's.48 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As late as 1928, the arrest of one Harlem youth for possession
of a small amount of marijuana was news.&quot; Thus, we conclude
that the number of users was still small, although it may have
begun to grow around 1935, and that these users were still
concentrated regionally in the West and Southwest and
socioeconomically within the lower class Mexican-American and
Black communities. </p>

<p>At the same time, the overwhelming majority of middle-class
Americans in the 1930's knew nothing of marijuana use-they had
never seen marijuana and knew no one who used the drug. Prior to
1935 there was little, if any, attention given marijuana in major
national magazines50 and the leading national newspapers.51 That
few middle class Americans in this period knew anything of
marijuana or its effects is best illustrated by the fact that the
Bureau of Narcotics conducted a campaign to alert people to the
dangers of marijuana. The Bureau as early as 1932 began arousing
public opinion against marijuana by &quot;an educational campaign
describing the drug, its identification and its evil
effects.&quot; 52 In July 1936, the New York City police were
shown marijuana so that they would recognize it growing or in
dried, smokeable form .53 Thus, even policemen had to be shown
the plant as late as 1936 to permit effective enforcement of the
New York state law. We may accordingly infer that the level of
public familiarity with the drug was quite low indeed.54 </p>

<p>What little information filtered to the middle class was
generated by sporadic campaigns by local newspapers detailing the
potential evils of marijuana; the accounts, as before, were
sensationalistic and tended to exacerbate latent ethnic
prejudices. For example, a 1934 newspaper account linked crime in
the Southwest with marijuana smoking Mexican-Americans in the
region.55 In a 1935 letter to the editor of the New York Times, a
Sacramento, California, reader asserted: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Marijuana, perhaps now the most iinsidious of our
    narcotics, is a direct by-product of unrestricted Mexican
    immigration . . . . Mexican peddlers have been caught
    distributing sample marijuana cigarettes to school
    children.56 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The writer went on to demand a quota on Mexicans permitted to
enter the country. In testifying in favor of the Marihuana Tax
Act, Commissioner Anslinger submitted a letter he had received
from the editor of a Colorado newspaper asking the Bureau to help
stamp out the marijuana menace. After describing an attack by a
Mexican-American, allegedly under the influence of marijuana, on
a girl of his region the writer stated: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I wish I could show you what a small marijuana cigaret can
    do to one of our degenerate Spanish-speaking residents.
    That's why our problem is so great; the greatest percentage
    of our population is composed of Spanish-speaking persons,
    most of whom are low mentally, because of social and racial
    conditions.57 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, in the testimony at the hearings on the Marihuana Tax
Act the following is excerpted from an article included in the
record: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>We find then that Colorado reports that the Mexican
    population there cultivates on an average of 2 to 3 tons of
    the weed annually. This the Mexicans make Into cigarettes,
    which they sell at two for 25 cents, mostly to white school
    students.58 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, not only did few middle-class Americans know about
marijuana and its use, but also what little
&quot;information&quot; was available provoked an automatic
adverse association of the drug with Mexican immigration, crime
and the deviant life style in the Black ghettos. Naturally, the
impending drug legislation, as had the earlier state legislation,
became entangled with society's views of these minority groups. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>2. Role of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics</b> </p>

<p>It has become quite fashionable among critics of existing
marijuana legislation to assert that the sole cause of the
illegal status of marijuana has been the crusading zeal of the
Federal Bureau of Narcotics and especially of its long-time head,
Harry J. Anslinger. Some observers have suggested that the
Bureau's activity was produced by bureaucratic exigencies and the
need to expand;59 others have said the Bureau was on a moral
crusade;60 still others have asserted that the Bureau believed
its own propaganda about the link between criminality and dope
fiends.61 While much of this may be true, it is clear that the
Bureau did not single-handedly conjure up the idea of banning
marijuana use. Since many states had already undertaken the
regulation of marijuana before the creation of the Bureau in
1930, we cannot credit the Bureau alone with the pressure to
outlaw the drug. </p>

<p>At the same time, it is certain that the Federal Bureau of
Narcotics' actions quickened the pace of the passage by state
legislators of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act. The Bureau saw the
passage of state narcotics laws as one of its primary objectives.
To this end we have detailed how directly the Bureau was involved
in the creation of the Final Draft of the Uniform Act. After
approval of the Final Draft, the Bureau began a significant
campaign in the newspapers and legal journals to boost public
support for the Uniform Act.62 By detailing the inability of
federal enforcement agencies to deal with the burgeoning
narcotics traffic, the Bureau continued to press for passage of
the Uniform Act by creating a felt need in the public for such
legislation.63 Despite the efforts of the Bureau, the Uniform Act
went virtually unnoticed by legal commentators and periodicals,
and by the public media. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>3. Legislative Scrutiny and Media Coverage</b> </p>

<p>The Uniform Act was passed by the legislatures of most states
with out scientific study or debate and without attracting public
attention. </p>

<p>In examining in detail the passage of the Uniform Act in
Virginia and some other selected states, it will be clear that
public concern over marijuana succeeded the outlawing of the drug
and did not precede it. Our methodology to determine the extent
of public attention in a given state at the time of the passage
of the act was to review the newspapers of larger cities for the
two weeks before and after passage.64 </p>

<p>In Virginia the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act passed the House
88-0 on February 16, 1934,65 and was approved 34-0 by the Senate
on February 22.66 Although the Act as passed in Virginia
contained no marijuana provisions, the same legislature the next
month passed a bill (H.B. 236), prohibiting &quot;use of opium,
marijuana [and] loco weed ... in the manufacture of cigarettes,
cigars&quot; and other tobacco products.67 This law, which
amended a 1910 Virginia statute prohibiting the use of opium in
the manufacture of cigarettes,68 was the first mention of
marijuana, or any of its derivatives in the Virginia Code. </p>

<p>An examination of the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the newspaper
of the state capital and perhaps the most influential newspaper
in the state at that time, for the period surrounding the
enactment of these two provisions (February 1 to March 15, 1934)
shows clearly that little, if any, public attention attended
their passage. There is no mention at any time of H.B. 236.69 As
for H.B. 94 (the Uniform Act), the Times Dispatch reported on
February 7 that the bill had been introduced. This announcement
was buried among the list of all bills introduced and referred on
February 6.70 In a February 12 article dealing with
&quot;controversial&quot; bills before the House and Senate that
week no mention was made of H.B. 94. On March 6, the newspaper
recorded: &quot;Among the important bills passed were. . . . [far
down the list] the Scott bill, making the State narcotic law
conform to the Federal statute.&quot; 71 That is the sum of the
publicity received by the Uniform Act and the statute that first
regulated marijuana in any way in Virginia. </p>

<p>In 1936, the legislature passed a separate statute prohibiting
the sale and use of marijuana. This bill-S.B. 289-passed the
House and Senate unanimously.72 The Act prohibited, except for a
narrow medical exception, sale, possession, use and cultivation
of marijuana .73 The penalties for violation, interestingly, were
more severe than those for violation of the 1934 Uniform Act.
Looking again at the Times-Dispatch for the period from February
15 to March 19, 1936, we find only one brief article on the new
marijuana legislation. After the Senate passed the measure on
February 29, the following appeared: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Among the bills passed by the Senate was the Apperson
    measure prohibiting the cultivation, sale or distribution of
    derivatives of the plant cannabis sativa, introduced as an
    outgrowth of alleged traffic in marihuana cigarettes in
    Roanoke. It fixes punishment for violation of its provisions
    at from one to 10 years in the penitentiary, or by
    confinement in jail for 12 months and a fine of not more than
    $1,000 or both. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Charges that school children were being induced to become
    addicts of marihuana cigarettes and that the weed was being
    cultivated in and near the city on a wide scale were laid
    before the Roanoke City Council last year. A youth who said
    he was a former addict of the drug testified before the
    Council that inhalation of one of the cigarettes would
    produce a 'cheap drunk' of several days' duration.74 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No further mention of this statute was made after the House
passed it or after the Governor signed it into law. </p>

<p>In order to determine whether the lack of public attention in
Virginia was common to other states when the first prohibition of
marijuana took place, we have surveyed the leading newspapers of
several other states at the times encompassing passage of the
law. We tried to select states that had not previously regulated
use of the drug under the assumption that more publicity would
attend initial legislation than an amendment of existing law. </p>

<p>In New Jersey, Rhode Island, Oregon and West Virginia, for
example, the major newspapers of Newark, Providence, Salem and
Charleston 78 respectively, referred to the Uniform Act only once
and to marijuana not at all. In Kentucky, the Louisville Herald
Post printed only two short references to the Uniform Act,79 one
of which referred to marijuana: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>[Congressman] Kramer added that boys and girls of school
    age are being led into the use of habit forming drugs by
    underworld leaders.......... Muggles&quot; or cigarettes made
    from marijuana, commonly called loco weed or hemp, are also
    tabooed under the new state law, it was learned.80 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Typical of both legislative and newspaper concern about the
new law is the following Charleston Daily Mail comment: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>A Narcotic Bill </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Inconspicuously upon the special calendar of the house of
    delegates rather far down upon it-is Engrossed S.B. No. 230,
    lodging specific powers in the hands of state authorities for
    the control of the traffic in narcotics. It has passed the
    Senate unanimously. It should pass the House, and its only
    danger of defeat there is the very real one that it will
    become lost in the shuffle of adjournment now but a few hours
    away. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The bill goes under the name of the uniform narcotic drug
    act and it is just that. Identical measures for the control
    by the states of illicit traffic on drugs have been passed by
    other states, notably the Southern group. Its passage here
    would result in a broad territory in which there are
    corresponding laws .... 81 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The editorial nowhere mentions marijuana. The bill itself
passed in the waning hours of the special session with no
subsequent attention given it. 82 </p>

<p>From our survey of these and other states, we have concluded
that with but one exception83 the Virginia experience was the
norm. (1) The laws prohibiting use, sale, possession, and
distribution of marijuana passed unnoticed by the media. There
was no public outcry for such legislation. (2) Quite often the
bill was buried beneath more controversial bills in a busy
legislative session. (3) In many states the Act was passed late
in the session along with myriad other
&quot;uncontroversial&quot; laws. (4) Finally, no state undertook
independent study to determine the medical facts about
marijuana-they relied on information supplied by the Federal
Bureau of Narcotics84 or a few lurid newspaper stories.85 </p>

<hr>

<p><b>4. Available Medical Opinion</b> </p>

<p>In conjunction with the fourth conclusion from our state case
histories of the passage of this Act, we should examine the
extent of medical knowledge that might have been available to
legislators had they wanted to conduct an independent evaluation
of the dangers of the hemp drugs. </p>

<p>There were five influential sources for information about the
effects of marijuana and hemp on humans. None of these were
conducted with the scientific precision characterizing modern
studies of drug effects. However, they each deserve mention here
either because they deserved attention then or because they
heavily influenced later commentators. </p>

<p>The first exhaustive study of the effects of cannabis and the
other hemp drugs was done by the British in India. Their Indian
Hemp Drugs Commission studied cannabis use among the native
population in India in 1893 and 1894,86 and submitted its
conclusions in a 500-page report. The Commission received
evidence from 1,193 witnesses, including 335 doctors, and studied
the relevant drug-related judicial proceedings and the intake
records of every mental hospital in British India. As a result
they concluded: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In regard to the moral effects of the drugs, the
    Commission are of opinion that their moderate use produces no
    moral injury whatever. There is no adequate ground for
    believing that it injuriously affects the character of the
    consumer. Excessive consumption, on the other hand, both
    indicates and intensifies moral weakness or depravity.
    Manifest excess leads directly to loss of self-respect, and
    thus to moral degradation. In respect to his relations with
    society, however, even the excessive consumer of hemp drugs
    is ordinarily inoffensive. His excesses may indeed bring him
    to degraded poverty which may lead him to dishonest
    practices; and occasionally, but apparently very rarely
    indeed, excessive indulgence in hemp drugs may lead to
    violent crime. But for all practical purposes it may be laid
    down that there is little or no connection between the use of
    hemp drugs and crime.87 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is quite clear, however, that the Indian Hemp Drug
Commission88 Report was not disseminated in the United States
until 1969 . </p>

<p>On the other hand, periodic reports of the Panama Canal Zone
Governor's Committee to study the physical and moral effects of
the use of marijuana were available to legislators before the
passage of the Uniform Act. After an investigation extending from
April to December 1925, the Committee reached the following
conclusions: </p>

<p>There is no evidence that marijuana as grown here is a
&quot;habit-forming&quot; drug in the sense in which the term is
applied to alcohol, opium, cocaine etc. or that it has any
appreciable deleterious in influence on the individual using
it.89 </p>

<p>In 1933, a similar Panama Canal Zone committee reported: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Delinquencies due to marijuana smoking which result in
    trial by military court are negligible in number when
    compared with delinquencies resulting from the use of
    alcoholic drinks which also may be classed as stimulants and
    intoxicants.90 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>About the time that the final Governor's Committee Report from
the Canal Zone was completed, a New Orleans physician, Dr.
Fossier, completed a study from which he concluded that marijuana
was a highly dangerous drug with habit-forming properties.91 This
piece would have remained relatively unnoticed due to the
obscurity of the journal in which it was published had it not
been picked up by the New Orleans District Attorney, Eugene
Stanley, and made the basis for his own article-Marihuana as a
Developer of Criminals92 which appeared in a law enforcement
journal. Mr. Stanley stated: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It is an ideal drug to cut off inhibitions quickly. . . . </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>At the present time the underworld has been quick to
    realize the value of this drug in subjugating the will of
    human derelicts to that of a master mind. Its use sweeps away
    all restraint, and to its influence may be attributed many of
    our present day crimes. It has been the experience of the
    Police and Prosecuting Officials in the South that
    immediately before the commission of many crimes the use of
    marihuana cigarettes has been indulged in by criminals so as
    to relieve themselves from the natural restraint which might
    deter them from the commission of criminal acts, and to give
    them the false courage necessary to commit the contemplated
    crime.93 </p>

<p>Mr. Stanley's article, based on no empirical data whatsoever,
was widely used by courts to corroborate early legislation and by
lobbyists to justify the later prohibitive legislation against
the hemp drugs.94 </p>

<p>In 1933 the following colloquy appeared in the Journal of the
American Medical Association: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Effects of Cannabis </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>To the Editor:-I have been hearing about the smoking of
    cigarets dipped into or medicated with fluid extract of
    Cannabis americana. I can find nothing about the use of the
    drug by addicts. What is its immediate effect? What are its
    late effects? What is the minimum lethal dose? In what way
    does it differ from or resemble &quot;muggles&quot; in its
    action? While in Louisiana I was told that the use of
    marihuana causes dementia. Is this true' Please omit name. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>M.D., Illinois. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>ANSWER.-The effect of Cannabis americana is the same as
    that of Cannabis indica- and, of the effect of the latter,
    the books are so full that it is hardly necessary to detail
    them here. It must suffice here to say that cannabis, at the
    height of its action, usually produces hallucinations, with
    or without euphoria, and that these are followed by a deep
    sleep. Its most marked after-effect is the liability to the
    establishment of a craving for the drug, the habitual use of
    which undermines the intellectual qualities and the social
    value of the victim and leads to general physical
    deterioration. It is stated that smokers nearly always become
    imbecile in time. The minimum lethal dose is unknown, no
    fatalities having been reported in man. In view of the fact
    that one dose may kill one dog that has no marked effect on
    another, one must admit the possibility of a lethal effect on
    man. In view of what has been said, it must be admitted that
    &quot;marihuana,&quot; which is merely another name for
    Cannabis indica, may cause dementia.95 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reply contains no indication how or where the persons who
answered the question got their data. It seems clear from the
nature of the response that the medical community was quite
uncertain as to the effects of the drug in 1933. </p>

<p>In 1934, Dr. Walter Bromberg, senior psychiatrist at Bellevue
Hospital, reported that marijuana was not a habit-forming drug
and was far less responsible for crime than other drugs such as
alcohol. In this study, Bromberg drew his data from examination
of 2,216 inmates convicted of felonies.96 Dr. Bromberg pointed
out that marijuana users tend to be passive in comparison to
users of alcohol and that the hemp drugs should lead to crime
only in cases of use by already psychopathic types. 97 </p>

<p>This then was the extent of medical evidence available to
laymen and legislators alike at the time the Uniform Narcotic
Drug Act and the fast prohibitions of marijuana were enacted in
most states. We can conclude the following from our brief review
of the medical literature. (1) Little was really known about the
effects of marijuana use-there were few studies and what studies
there were had serious methodological flaws. (2) Even if the
studies we record had been adequate methodologically, they
appeared generally in obscure medical not widely read by laymen.
(3) Of these studies, most found marijuana relatively harmless
especially in contrast to use of alcohol. (4) None of these
studies were considered in either the formulation or the passage
of the Uniform Act in the states examined. And what is more
astounding is that instead of consulting medical opinion,
legislators relied on lurid newspaper accounts of marijuana,
often provided by defendants in criminal prosecutions whose
motivation was to use marijuana to escape criminal
responsibility. </p>

<p><b>5. Provisions of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act and
Supplemental Virginia Marijuana Statute</b> </p>

<p>Having studied the circumstances surrounding passage of the
Uniform Act and similar legislation in several states between
1932 and 1937, we shall briefly summarize the provisions of those
laws. </p>

<p>(a) Classification and Offenses.-The Virginia legislature made
no changes in the Uniform Act as drafted by the Commissioners and
did not include the supplementary marijuana provisions in passing
that Act.98 In 1936, Virginia passed special marijuana
legislation99. which defined cannabis exactly as did the
definitional provision of the Uniform Act. Both the special
marijuana statute in Virginia and the Uniform Act prohibited
possession, transfer and cultivation of the drug100 but did not
refer to the more specific acts that later came to be separated
and punished more heavily, such as sale to a minor and possession
of more than a certain amount. </p>

<p>(b) Penalties.-The Uniform Act contained no specific penalties
for its violations; the matter of supplying the appropriate
penalties was left to each state. Virginia punished first
violations of its Uniform Act by a fine not exceeding $100 and/or
imprisonment in jail not exceeding one year, and second and
subsequent offenses by a fine not exceeding $1,000 and/or
imprisonment for not more than five years in the penitentiary.101
The penalties for violation of Virginia's 1936 marijuana statute
were stiffer than for violation of its Uniform Act. Each offense
was punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary for from one
to ten years or by confinement in jail for not more than twelve
months and/or by a fine up to $1,000, in the discretion of the
court or jury.102 </p>

<p>An analysis of penalties for violation of the marijuana
statutes enacted in other states at about the same time indicates
Virginia's penalties were atypically harsh. In New Jersey, for
instance, the penalty for unlawful possession and sale of
marijuana was that attaching to a high misdemeanor.103 In Rhode
Island the penalty for unlawful possession was a fine of not more
than $1,000 or imprisonment for not more than threeyears or
both.104 For unlawful selling, Rhode Island provided a fine of
not more than $2,000 or imprisonment for not more than five years
or both.105 In Kentucky the penalty for a first offense violation
was a fine of not less than $100 and not more than $500 or jail
for not less than thirty days nor more than one year or both. For
second and subsequent offenses the statute required imprisonment
in the penitentiary for not less than one nor more than five
years.106 Finally, West Virginia penalized a first offender by a
fine not exceeding $100 or jail for not exceeding one year or
both, and subsequent offenders by fine not exceeding $1,000 or
imprisonment in the penitentiary not exceeding five years or
both.107 </p>

<p>This comparison indicates that Virginia penalties could be
more severe than the average. Moreover, Virginia did not
distinguish in penalty between possession and sale of the drug,
and violation of Virginia's separate marijuana law could be more
heavily penalized than violation of the Uniform Act. </p>

<p>48. REPORT OF THE NEW YORK STATE BAR ASSOCIATION 133 [1925]
(emphasis original) Commissioner Anslinger felt that the states
had failed to do their part during this period: </p>

<p>Notwithstanding the limited power of the Federal Government,
state officers immediately became imbued with the erroneous
impression that the problem of preventing abuse of narcotic drugs
was one now [after the Harrison Act] exclusively cognizable by
the National Government, and that the Federal Law alone,
enforced, of course, by Federal agencies only, should represent
all the control necessary over the illicit narcotic drug traffic.

<p>97 Id. at 309; see Facts and Fancies About Marijuana, LITERARY
DIGEST, Oct. 24, 1936, at 7-8. This presentation begins by
digesting Dr. Bromberg's article for laymen: </p>

<p>It is clear from this study [of 2,216 criminals convicted of
felonies] that in this region the drug is a breeder of crime only
when used by psychopathic types in whom the drug allows the
emergence of aggressive, sexual or antisocial tendencies. . . .
It is quite probable that alcohol is more responsible as an agent
for crime than is marihuana. </p>

<p>The article continues: </p>

<p>The following facts stand out in social and medical reports: </p>

<p>1. Marihuana is not a habit-forming drug, as is heroin or
opium. </p>

<p>2. It prolongs sensations; it is in high favor as an
aphrodisiac. </p>

<p>3. It is the most inexpensive of drugs; marihuana cigarettes
usually selling at from three to twenty-five cents each. </p>

<p>The article then describes the effects of marijuana: </p>

<p>After smoking from one to three &quot;reefers,&quot; if one
has not been told what to expect, the first effects of the drug
pass almost unnoticed-nothing, perhaps, but a slight twitching of
muscles of the neck, back or legs. The mind remains calm and
clear. Suddenly, without apparent cause, a chance remark . . .
sends the subject into a spasm of violent laughter. </p>

<p>Becoming calm again, while the drug continues to exert its
weird effects, the smoker finds ideas crowding through his brain
with bewildering rapidity; those around him become slow-dull. Nor
is the language of his own tongue swift enough to keep pace with
his lightning thoughts. </p>

<p>Soon the self-esteem of the smoker begins to grow in like
proportion. . . . </p>

<p>Paradoxically, trifling discomforts become unbearable evils;
the flare of a match near-by brings a resentment that is
immediately transformed into an overwhelming desire for revenge.
But before the &quot;reefer man&quot; could possibly climb to his
feet, or even reach a hand for a gun or knife, new thoughts have
come crowding in.... </p>

<p>Above all other distinguishing effects of marihuana
intoxication is the fact that all normal conceptions of time and
space are lost. </p>

<p>As in the split-second dream that seems to last the night
through, time seems of interminable length; the clock stands
still for days. </p>

<p>Vision, too, takes on new concepts. Inconsiderable distances
become tremendous.... </p>

<p>Yet, throughout the intoxication, there is constant awareness
that the strange fancies rushing through the mind are not
natural, but purely the effects of the drug; unlike the
opium-cater, he is acutely conscious of those about him. He has
many of the sensations of the gay &quot;drunk&quot; at the ball. </p>

<p>Describing a pot-party: </p>

<p>There is little noise; windows are shut, keeping the smell of
smoking weeds away from what might be curious nostrils. </p>

<p>Nor is there any of the yelling, dashing about, playing of
crude jokes or physical violence that often accompany alcoholic

<p><b>THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT AND THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE: AN INQUIRY
INTO THE LEGAL HISTORY OF AMERICAN MARIJUANA PROHIBITION</b> </p>

<p><font size="2"><i>Richard J. Bonnie* &amp; Charles H.
Whitebread, II**</i></font> </p>

<p><b>V. PASSAGE OF THE MARIHUANA TAX ACT OF 1937</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>The first assertion of federal authority over marijuana use
was the Marihuana Tax Act, passed in 1937. The obvious question,
from a historical point of view, is why such legislation was
thought to be necessary, especially after the brushfire passage
of the Uniform Act and related legislation in every state in the
previous few years. Enforcement difficulty and public hysteria
are two reasons which have been propounded for the federal
action. We subscribe to a third, one which we rejected with
respect to the uniform acts-Congress was hoodwinked by the
Federal Bureau of Narcotics. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>A. State Enforcement of the Uniform Law</b> </p>

<p>One of the primary arguments in support of the Marihuana Tax
Act was that the legislation was required to permit and
facilitate adequate enforcement of the Uniform Narcotic Drug
Act.1 Initial examination of enforcement statistics after passage
of the Uniform Act suggests that marijuana seizures and arrests
in most states rose dramatically. </p>

<p>However, we should be careful to note at the outset the
inadequacies of most drug statistics, which, especially during
this period, do not permit conclusive analysis regarding the
extent of enforcement. </p>

<p>Reporting officials frequently do not differentiate among the
drugs. Different jurisdictions employ different measures of
enforcement-number of arrests, convictions, kilograms of the drug
seized, or number of seizures; even where the same measures are
used, statistics are often compiled for different time frames. In
addition, changes in the definitions in the laws-such as a change
from considering cannabis as only the flowering top of the plant
to considering it the whole plant-can wildly distort the
statistics from year to year. To add to the confusion,
enforcement agencies can manipulate the data for their own uses;
if they must appear to be attacking the drug problem or to need
more resources, they can change radically the statistical
appearance of the enforcement problem by using, for example,
arrests as their enforcement measure. Finally, the mere passage
of prohibitive legislation will in itself be reflected in the
enforcement data. This is especially important for our study of
enforcement patterns in the states before passage of the
Marihuana Tax Act. As one commentator has explained: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>A point that should be obvious but that is sometimes
    overlooked is that there are no official statistics relating
    to violations of a drug, law until the drug law is enacted.
    To compare official preenactment and postenactment data is to
    compare nothing to something, and naturally drug use will
    appear to rise.2 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>For all these reasons, the drug statistics from the period of
the 1930's must be used somewhat hesitantly to support any
contention about the extent of state enforcement before the
enactment of Marihuana Tax Act. With this caveat in mind, we
shall proceed, nevertheless, to do so. </p>

<p>Although Commissioner Anslinger testified at the hearings on
the Tax Act that state officials frequently asked for federal
assistance 3 it appears from the Federal Bureau's own statistics
that state and municipal agencies were proceeding with vigor to
stamp out marijuana use.4 We do not have fully accurate data, but
there are indications that both New York and Louisiana were
moving against marijuana use. In 1934, the New York police
discovered a large field of marijuana growing near the Brooklyn
Bridge. In making a related raid, the police also seized 1,000
marijuana cigarettes.5 In 1935, the police burned a marijuana
crop found growing on the grounds of the Welfare Island
penitentiary.6 Throughout 1936, the narcotics division of the New
York police found and destroyed several marijuana crops growing
in and around the city.7 Fragmentary figures are available on law
enforcement in Louisiana which indicate there were 219 arrests on
marijuana charges in New Orleans alone from 1930 until April of
1936.8 In Louisiana as a whole for 1936 over 1,195 pounds of bulk
marijuana were seized.9 </p>

<p>This evidence suggests that state authorities in areas where
marijuana use had become common at all were dealing fairly
effectively with the trade in the drug. Although some states may
have hoped that passage of a federal law dealing with marijuana
would reduce the enforcement burden on state and local police and
bring additional federal services and money,10 the law cannot
really be justified as filling an enforcement void. Nevertheless,
this was one of the most effective arguments advanced by
Commissioner Anslinger in the halls of Congress. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>B. Public Hysteria or Continued Public Ignorance?</b> </p>

<p>Some observers have attributed passage of the Tax Act to
public hysteria.11 In support of this contention they show that
there was a marked increase in the number of titles dealing with
marijuana in the Readers' Guide to Periodical Literature from
1936 until 1939, compared with the total absence of articles on
this subject in preceding years.12 It should be noted, however,
that only seven articles treating marijuana or hashish appeared
from 1920 to August 1937, when the Tax Act was passed.13 With
respect to medical opinion, the AMA Journal presented an article
opposing the enactment of the Tax Act and arguing, as did their
representative at the Tax Act hearings, 14 that existing state
laws were sufficient if properly enforced.15 </p>

<p>It seems the national media and medical opinion were far from
hysterical at the time the Tax Act passed. There were a few local
newspaper campaigns against the drug, but they tended to peak
about two years before the passage of the Act and were isolated
instances of public support for the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act.16
Moreover, these atypical state scares did not draw national
attention. </p>

<p>In fact, whatever publicity the &quot;marijuana problem&quot;
received during this period was attributable to Commissioner
Anslinger and his office, who conducted an active educational
campaign for federal legislation. They prepared press stories on
the dangers of the drug and traveled around the country
disseminating propaganda.17 Despite these efforts, however,
public knowledge of the marijuana proposals was minimal at best.
The New York Times contained nine references to marijuana from
January 1936 until it reported on August 3, 1937,18
&quot;President Roosevelt signed today a bill to curb traffic in
the narcotic, marihuana, through heavy taxes on
transactions.&quot; </p>

<p>As in prior years, marijuana was still not a matter of public
attention, and the so-called &quot;problem&quot; and the federal
proposal to cure it went virtually unnoticed by most of the
American public. At the same time, however, the
&quot;educational&quot; campaign conducted by the Bureau to
inform the Congress of the dimensions of the &quot;problem&quot;
was highly successful. In this sense, the Bureau itself created
the &quot;felt need&quot; for federal legislation; the Bureau-and
not public hysteria which it was unable to arouse-was the major
force behind the Tax Act. We assign to the Bureau the
instrumental role with respect to passage of the Tax Act even
though we did not do so with respect to the Uniform Act. So
successful were the Commissioner's efforts in the Congress that
the hearings before the House Ways and Means Committee and the
floor debate on the bill are near comic examples of dereliction
of legislative responsibility. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>C. The Tax Act Hearings</b> </p>

<hr>

<p><b>Note from Cliff Schaffer:</b> Interested readers may refer
to the full text of the hearings for the <a
href="../../../hemp/taxact/taxact.htm">Marihuana Tax Act</a>, and
related documents, also on this site. </p>

<hr>

<p>Although the Marihuana Tax Act was modeled after the Harrison
Act, marijuana was not simply included in the earlier act
primarily for three reasons. First, the importation focus of the
Harrison Act was inappropriate for marijuana because there were
domestic producers.20 </p>

<p>Second, since cannabis had been removed from the United States
Pharmacopoeia and had no recognized medicinal uses, the variety
of medical exceptions in the Harrison Act were inapplicable.21
Third, even though the Supreme Court had upheld the Harrison
Act's prohibition against purchase by unregistered persons of the
designated drugs, there was some uncertainty whether the earlier
5-4 decision22 would be followed. Accordingly, the Marihuana Tax
Act imposed a prohibitive tax of $100 an ounce on the designated
transactions, rather than prohibit the purchases directly.23 </p>

<p>The brief three days of hearings on the Act24 present a case
study in legislative carelessness. At no time was any primary
empirical evidence presented about the effects of the drug, and
the participating congressmen seem never to have questioned the
assumed evils. Furthermore, the only real concerns seem to have
been that farmers would be inconvenienced by having to kill a
plant which grew wild in many parts of the country, and that the
birdseed, paint and varnish, and domestic hemp industries would
be damaged by passage of the law.25 Finally, the one witness
appearing in opposition to the bill, Dr. William C. Woodward,
legislative counsel of the American Medical Association and an
early and respected participant in the drafting of the Uniform
Narcotic Drug Act,26 was roundly insulted for his audacity in
daring to question the wisdom of the Act. </p>

<p>We reproduce in the following few pages some of the dialogue
from the hearings, to give the reader the flavor of these
ramshackle proceedings, and to allow him to understand more fully
the pyramiding of absurdity represented by the amendments of the
1950's. From the hearings we extract contemporary perception of
use patterns and harmful effects of marijuana, the quality of
medical and other evidence presented, and a short glimpse at how
the witnesses were treated by the committee. </p>

<p><b>1. Who Were Users?</b> </p>

<p>The record of the hearings indicates quite clearly that the
Federal Narcotics Bureau was anxious for the committeemen to
believe marijuana use was a relatively new phenomenon that was on
the increase in America.27 Once again, marijuana use and the
Mexican minority were closely linked: &quot;The Mexican laborers
have brought seeds of this plant into Montana and it is fast
becoming a terrible menace, particularly in the counties where
sugarbeets are grown.&quot;28 Again, also, marijuana was
presented as the agent by which the underworld class hoped to
enslave American youth.29 The youth of the marijuana users was
contrasted with the increasing age of the usual opiate addict.
Perhaps most interestingly for later developments, Commissioner
Anslinger succinctly noted that heroin addicts and marijuana
users came from totally different classes and that the use of one
drug was unrelated to use of the other: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. Anslinger.</b> This drug is not being used by those
    who have been using heroin and morphine. It is being used by
    a different class, by a much younger group of people. The age
    of the morphine and heroin addict is increasing all the time,
    whereas the marihuana smoker is quite young. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. Dingell. </b>I am just wondering whether the
    marihuana addict graduates into a heroin, an opium or cocaine
    user. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. Anslinger.</b> No sir; I have not heard of a case
    of that kind. I think it is an entirely different class. The
    marihuana addict does not go in that direction30 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The hearings shed no more light on who was using the drug and
in what numbers. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>2. What's Wrong with Marijuana?</b> </p>

<p>If the proceedings did not shed light on the patterns of
usage, this in no way was an obstacle to unanimity on the evils
of the drug-insanity, criminality and death. Three major sources
were relied on to support this consensus (1) a variety of horror
stories from newspapers cited by Mr. Anslinger and others about
atrocious criminal acts committed by individuals under the
influence of the drug;31 (2) studies by Eugene Stanley, the
District Attorney of New Orleans, linking the drug and the
population of the Louisiana jails;32 and (3) some inconclusive
experimentation on dogs.33 As we noted earlier, the newspaper
stories about crimes committed under the influence of marijuana
have two things in common: The reports are unsubstantiated, and
many of the accused invoked their use of marijuana as a defense
to the charge .34 </p>

<p>The New Orleans report concluded: &quot;After an exhaustive
research on marijuana from its earliest history to the present
time, this drug is in our judgment the one that must be
eliminated entirely.&quot; 35 What was this exhaustive research?
It appears to have been nothing but quotations from the most
hysterical series of newspaper articles to appear at that time36
and reports of the number of marijuana addicts to be found in the
prison population.37 The relation of these figures to the
conclusion that the drug must be regulated was never established.
</p>

<p>The Stanley study38 was even less well documented and even
more outrageous in its description of the effects of marijuana
use. &quot;It is an ideal drug to quickly cut off
inhibitions.&quot; 39 For this proposition Stanley relied on the
story of the Persian &quot;Assassins&quot; who allegedly
committed acts of terror while under the influence of hashish.
Although Stanley included in his list of references the Indian
Hemp Drugs Commission Report, it is clear he made little effort
to catalogue the then available data but contented himself with a
number of bold and undocumented assertions. In reading the
hearings, one continues to expect some report of a medical or
scientific survey, and instead one finds these two reports by New
Orleans law enforcers. The contrary conclusions of the Canal Zone
studies were not even mentioned. </p>

<p>Finally, a scientific study of the effects of marijuana was
presented, but, in keeping with the overall tone of the hearings,
this was the most preposterous evidence of all. The Treasury
Department presented a pharmacologist who had tested the effects
of the cannabis drugs on dogs. 40 He concluded that
&quot;[c]ontinuous use will tend to cause the degeneration of one
part of the brain.&quot; 41. </p>

<p>One paragraph later, however, this scientist stated:
&quot;Only about 1 dog in 300 is very sensitive to the
test.&quot;42 Later in the doctor's testimony, after he had
stated over and over the potential evils found from the testing
on dogs, he was unable to make the crucial link between a dog's
response to the drug and the human response. More incredibly, as
the following exchange points out, the doctor really had no
knowledge of what effect the drug had on the dogs, since he was
not familiar with the psychology of dogs: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. McCormack</b>. Have you experimented upon any
    animals whose reaction to this drug would be similar to that
    of human beings. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Dr. Munch.</b> The reason we use dogs is because the
    reaction of dogs to this drug, closely resembles the reaction
    of human beings. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. McCormack. </b>And the continued use of it, as you
    have observed the reaction on dogs, has resulted in the
    disintegration of the personality? </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Dr. Munch.</b> Yes. So far as I can tell, not being a
    dog psychologist .... 43 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr. Woodward, the sole witness representing the American
Medical Association, noted the inadequacy of these medical
statistics. We include his statement on that point in full: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>That there is a certain amount of narcotic addiction of an
    objectionable character no one will deny. The newspapers have
    called attention to it so prominently that there must be some
    grounds for their statements. It has surprised me, however,
    that the facts on which these statements have been based have
    not been brought before this committee by competent primary
    evidence. We arc referred to newspaper publications
    concerning the prevalence of marihuana addiction. We are told
    that the use of marihuana causes crime. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>But yet no one has been produced from the Bureau of
    Prisons to show the number of prisoners who have been found
    addicted to the marihuana habit. An informal inquiry shows
    that the Bureau of Prisons has no evidence on that point. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>You have been told that school children are great users of
    marihuana cigarettes. No one has been summoned from the
    Children's Bureau to show the nature and extent of the habit,
    among children. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Inquiry of the Children's Bureau shows that they have had
    no occasion to investigate it and know nothing particularly
    of it. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Inquiry of the Office of Education-and they certainly
    should know something of the prevalence of the habit among
    the school children of the country, if there is a prevalent
    habit-indicates that they have had no occasion to investigate
    and know nothing of it. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Moreover, there is in the Treasury Department itself, the
    Public Health Service, with its Division of Mental Hygiene.
    The Division of Mental Hygiene was, in the first place, the
    Division of Narcotics. It was converted into the Division of
    Mental Hygiene, I think, about 1930. That particular Bureau
    has control at the present time of the narcotics farms that
    were created about 1929 or 1930 and came into operation a few
    years later. No one his been summoned from that Bureau to
    give evidence on that point. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Informal inquiry by me indicates that they have had no
    record of any marihuana or Cannabis addicts who have even
    been committed to those farms. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The Bureau of the Public Health Service has also a
    division of pharmacology. If you desire evidence as to the
    pharmacology, of Cannabis, that obviously is the place where
    you can get direct and primary evidence, rather than the
    indirect hearsay evidence. 44 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr. Woodward's testimony clearly manifests the deficiencies of
the hearings, for at no time did the congressional committee hear
primary sources of competent medical evidence before labeling
cannabis the producer of crime and insanity. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>3. How Dare You Dissent!</b> </p>

<p>Following the testimony of the Treasury Department and its
witnesses, the only witnesses who came forward were
representatives of legitimate industries that feared the Tax Act
would damage their businesses, because manufacture of their
products required some part or parts of the cannabis plant.45
These witnesses were assured that the Tax Act would have little
if any impact on their operations .46 </p>

<p>The one witness who opposed the adoption of the Act was
roundly accused of obstructionism and bad faith. Dr. Woodward,
one of the chief drafters of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act,
appeared on behalf of the AMA to suggest that, if there was to be
any regulation of the cannabis drugs at all, it should be added
to the Harrison Act and not be the subject of this separate, and
he felt inadequately considered, legislative proposal.47 We have
already examined Dr. Woodward's skepticism on the dangers of the
drug. He added to this a thinly veiled attack on the lack of
cooperation the AMA had received from the Federal Bureau of
Narcotics.48 Finally, he advocated either assisting state
enforcement of their existing laws dealing with the drug or at
most including marijuana as a regulated and taxed drug under the
Harrison Act. </p>

<p>Either because of antipathy to the AMA or because of the
audacity of these suggestions, the Committee members savagely
attacked both Dr. Woodward and the AMA. Witness the following
exchange, starting with the doctor's answer to questions why, he
had not proposed marijuana legislation </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Dr. Woodward. </b>In the first place, it is not a
    medical addiction that is involved and the data do not come
    before the medical society. You may absolutely forbid the use
    of Cannabis by any physician, or the disposition of Cannabis
    by any pharmacist in the country, and you would not have
    touched your Cannabis addiction as it stands today, because
    there is no relation between it and the practice of medicine
    or pharmacy. It is entirely outside of the those two
    branches. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>The Chairman.</b> If the statement that you have made
    has any relation to the question that I asked, I just do not
    have the mind to understand it; I am sorry. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Dr. Woodward.</b> I say that we do not ordinarily come
    directly to Congress if a department can take care of the
    matter. I have talked with the Commissioner, with
    Commissioner Anslinger. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>The Chairman. </b>If you want to advise us on
    legislation, you ought to come here with some constructive
    proposals, rather than criticism, rather than trying to throw
    obstacles in the way of something that the Federal Government
    is trying to do. It has not only an unselfish motive in this,
    but the), have a serious responsibility. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Dr. Woodward. </b>We cannot understand yet, Mr.
    Chairman, why this bill should have been prepared in secret
    for 2 years without any intimation, even, to the profession,
    that it was being prepared .49 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>After accusing Dr. Woodward of obstruction, evasion and bad
faith, the Committee did not even thank him for his testimony.50 </p>

<hr>

<p><b>D. Congressional &quot;Deliberation&quot; and Action</b> </p>

<p>We noted earlier that the marijuana &quot;problem&quot; and
the proposed federal cure were virtually unnoticed by the general
public. Unable to arouse public opinion through its educational
campaign, the Bureau of Narcotics nevertheless pushed the
proposed legislation through congressional committees. The
Committee members were convinced by meaningless evidence that
federal action was urgently needed to suppress a problem that was
no greater and probably less severe than it had been in the
preceding six years when every state had passed legislation to
suppress it. The Committee was also convinced, incorrectly, that
the public was aware of the evil and demanded federal action. </p>

<p>The debate on the floor of Congress shows both the low public
visibility of the legislation and the nonchalance of the
legislators. The bill passed the House of Representatives in the
very late afternoon of a long session; many of the members were
acquainted neither with marijuana nor with the purpose of the
Act. When the bill first came to the House floor late on June 10,
1937, one congressman objected to considering the bill at such a
late hour, whereupon the following colloquy occurred: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. DOUGHTON. </b>I ask unanimous consent for the
    present consideration of the bill (H.R. 6906) to impose an
    occupational excise tax upon certain dealers in marihuana, to
    impose a transfer tax upon certain dealings in marihuana, and
    to safeguard the revenue therefrom by registry and recording.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The Clerk read the title of the bill. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. SNELL.</b> Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to
    object, and notwithstanding the fact that my friend, Reed, is
    in favor of it, is this a matter we should bring up at this
    late hour of the afternoon? I do not know anything about the
    bill. It may be all right and it may be that everyone is for
    it, but as a general principle, I am against bringing up any
    important legislation, and I suppose this is important, since
    it comes from the Ways and Means Committee, at this late hour
    of the day.<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. RAYBURN.</b> Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will
    yield, I may say that the gentleman from North Carolina has
    stated to me that this bill has a unanimous report from the
    committee and that there is no controversy about it. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. SNELL. </b>What is the bill? </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. RAYBURN</b>. It has something to do with something
    that is called marihuana. I believe it is a narcotic of some
    kind. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. FRED M. VINSON. </b>Marihuana is the same as
    hashish. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. SNELL.</b> Mr. Speaker, I am not going to object
    but I think, it is wrong to consider legislation of this
    character at this time of night.51 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>On June 14 when the bill finally emerged on the House floor,
four representatives in one way or another asked that the
proponents explain the provisions of the Act. Instead of a
detailed analysis, they received a statement of one of the
members of the Ways and Means Committee repeating uncritically
the lurid criminal acts Anslinger had attributed to marijuana
users at the hearings. After less than two pages of debate. the
Act passed without a roll call.52 When the bill returned as
amended from the Senate, the House considered it once again, and
adopted as quickly as possible the Senate suggestions, which were
all minor.53 The only question was whether the AMA agreed with
the bill. Mr. Fred Vinson not only said they did not object when
in fact their committee witness had dissented strenuously, but he
also claimed that the bill had AMA support. After turning Dr.
Woodward's testimony on its head, he also called him by another
name, Wharton.54 </p>

<p>In summary, the Act passed the Congress with little debate and
even less public attention. Provoked almost entirely by the
Federal Bureau of Narcotics and by a few hysterical state law
enforcement agents hoping to get federal support for their
activities, the law was tied neither to scientific study nor to
enforcement need. The Marihuana Tax Act was hastily drawn, heard,
debated and passed; it was the paradigm of the uncontroversial
law. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>E. Provisions of the Act</b> </p>

<p>Except for the three differences noted above, the Marihuana
Tax Act is modeled directly after the earlier federal tax act
regulating the opiates -the Harrison Act. As with that Act, the
enforcement of the new marijuana tax was left to the Bureau of
Narcotics in the Treasury Department. Thus, as a result of the
1937 statute, the jurisdiction of the Bureau was increased
substantially.55 </p>

<p>The Marihuana Tax Act deals specifically with the seeds, resin
and most other parts and derivatives of the plant Cannabis Sativa
L. The Act requires persons importing, producing,56 selling or in
any other way dealing with the drug to pay an occupational tax
and to register with the Internal Revenue Service. In addition,
all transferees of marijuana are required to file a written order
form and to pay a transfer tax, $1 per ounce if registered and a
prohibitive $100 per ounce if not registered . 57 Possession of
the drug without a written order form constitutes presumptive
evidence of noncompliance with the Act. It is also unlawful for a
transferor to transfer the drug to a person who has not secured
the order form and paid the tax. As originally enacted, section
12 of the Act assessed a fine of not more than $2,000 and/or
imprisonment for not more than five years for violation of each
provision of the Act.<br>

<h2>Footnotes and References </h2>

<p>1 The best example of this argument is contained in
Commissioner Anslinger's statement to the congressional committee
hearings on the Marihuana Tax Act: </p>

<p align="center"><b>STATE LAWS</b> </p>

<p>All of the States now have some type of legislation directed
against the traffic in marijuana for improper purposes. There is
no legislation in effect with respect to the District of Columbia
dealing with marijuana traffic. There is unfortunately a loophole
in much of this State legislation because of a too narrow
definition of this term. Few of the States have a special
narcotic law enforcement agency and, speaking generally,
considerable training of the regular peace officers will be
required together with increased enforcement facilities before a
reasonable measure of effectiveness under the State laws can be
achieved. </p>

<p align="center"><b>NEED FOR FEDERAL LEGISLATION</b> </p>

<p>Even in States which have legislation controlling in some
degree the marijuana traffic, public officials, private citizens,
and the press have urged or suggested the need for national
legislation dealing with this important problem. A partial list
of States wherein officials or the press have urged the need for
Federal legislation on the subject are Colorado, Kansas, New
Mexico, Louisiana, and Oklahoma. </p>

<p>The uniform State narcotic law has now been adopted by some 35
States, many of these including cannabis or marijuana within the
scope of control by that law. However, it has recently been
learned that the legislative definition of cannabis in most of
these laws is too narrow, and it will be necessary to have the
definition amplified in amendatory legislation in most of the
States, to accord with the definition in the pending Federal
bill. As is the case at present with respect to opium, coca
leaves, and their respective alkaloids, the uniform State law
does not completely solve the enforcement problem with respect to
marijuana but it will provide the necessary supplement to the
Federal act and permit cooperation of State and Federal forces,
each acting within its respective sphere, toward suppression of
traffic for abusive use, no matter in what form the traffic is
conducted. The Bureau of Narcotics, under the Marijuana Taxing
Act, would continue to act as an informal coordinating agency in
the enforcement of the Uniform State law, exchanging information
as between the respective State authorities in the methods of
procedure and attempting to secure true uniformity in the
enforcement of the act in the various States which have adopted
it. </p>

<p>Young men between the ages of 16 and 25 are frequent smokers
of marihuana; even boys of 10 to 14 are initiated (frequently in
school groups); to them as to others, marihuana holds out the
thrill. Since the economic depression the number of marihuana

<p>34 See id. at 22-23. It is entirely likely that some of these

defendants, who, upon being caught red-handed in the commission
of crime, sought mitigation of their penalties by claiming to be
under the influence of the drug. See Bromberg, Marijuana: A
Psychiatric Study, 113 J.A.M.A. 4 (1939). Bromberg cautions,

<p><b>VI. THE 1950's: HARSHER PENALTIES AND A NEW RATIONALE-THE
&quot;STEPPING STONE&quot; THEORY</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 1950's witnessed the advent of an extremist legislative
policy with respect to drugs generally and marijuana in
particular. For the first time in our national history, there was
public interest in narcotic drugs. Apparently there had been an
increase in narcotic drug abuse in the late 40's, and the public
mind was ripe for the FBN propaganda. In the paranoid atmosphere
of the times, the call for harsher penalties was soothing.
Unfortunately, marijuana was caught in the turbulence of this
era. Although the pharmacological facts about the drug were
beginning to emerge, congressional furor was aroused by the novel
assertion, rejected by Commissioner Anslinger in 1937, that use
of marijuana led to use of harder drugs. This new plateau of
misinformation was to provide the base for continual escalation
of penalties and proliferation of offenses throughout the decade.
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>A. The Boggs Act and Its Progeny: The First Escalation</b> </p>

<p>In 1951 Congress passed the next major piece of federal
narcotics legislation-the Boggs Act .2 The importance of this
legislation is that provided much harsher penalties for all drug
violators. Also, for the first time on the federal level,
marijuana and other narcotics were lumped together as a result of
the Act's provision for uniform penalties for violators of either
the Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act3 or the Marihuana Tax
Act.4 This indiscriminate treatment of marijuana as just another
narcotic drug flew in the face of contemporary testimony
challenging the assumption that the hemp drugs were addictive,
crime-producing, and likely to lead to insanity and death. New
testimony that marijuana was unlikely to be addictive was buried
under the new rationale for harsh penalties against offenders of
the marijuana laws-that the drug inevitably is the stepping stone
to heroin addiction. Eventually, the states followed the federal
lead in striking out against drug violators with the same
mindless fervor that characterized their anti-communist
campaigns. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>1. The Problem: Increased Narcotics Use</b> </p>

<p>The hearings before the Subcommittee of the House Ways and
Means Committee and the floor debate show that the primary reason
for passage of the Boggs Act was the increase in narcotic use in
the period 1948-1951. Testimony and evidence from a wide variety
of sources indicated an abrupt and substantial increase in
addiction, especially among teenagers, between 1947 and 1951.5
Young people under 21 who had rarely been addicts suddenly became
a predominant group involved in addiction and narcotics crimes.6
Representative Boggs, speaking during the congressional debates
on his bill, enunciated a concern which was reflected in many
other quarters. After noting that there had been a 24 percent
increase in arrests for narcotics violations between 1949 and
1950 and a 77 percent increase between 1948 and 1950,
Representative Boggs stated: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The most shocking part about these figures is the fact
    that there has been an alarming increase in drug addiction
    among younger persons. In the first- 6 months of 1946, the
    average age of addicted persons committed . . . at Lexington,
    Ky. was 37.5 years. Only 3 patients were under the age of 21.
    During the first 6 months of 1950, only 4 years later, the
    average had dropped to 26.7 years, and 766 patients were
    under the age of 21.... [I]n New York City alone it has been
    estimated that 1 out of every 200 teenagers is now addicted
    to some type of narcotics.7 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later he said, &quot;We need only to recall what we have read
in the papers in the past week to realize that more and more
younger people are falling into the clutches of unscrupulous dope
peddlers . . . .&quot; 8 </p>

<p>Representative Boggs then proceeded to insert in the record
eleven newspaper and magazine articles dated between May 2 and
July 16, 1951.9 The Washington Evening Star of July 16 (the day
of the debate) carried a story on the results of a mayor's
committee report on drug addiction in New York City. According to
the newspaper, &quot;between 45,000 and 90,000 persons in New
York City are using illicit dope.... Based on the city's
population of 7,835,099, that would be 1 out of every 87 or 1 out
of 174 persons.&quot; The paper indicated that the report showed
an increase in addiction among teenagers, and it called for
&quot;more severe penalties for dope sellers, and for wholesale
revisions of Federal and State penal statutes relating to
sale.&quot; </p>

<p>An article in Time magazine of June 25, 1951, inserted by Mr.
Boggs, related New York City School Superintendent William
Jansen's statement that one out of every 200 high school students
in the city was a user of habit forming drugs. The article went
on to describe the alarming increases in dope consumption&quot;
in other major cities and the ease with which school children
obtained narcotics. Another article, in the Washington Evening
Star of June 12, 1951, contained statements by a member of the
staff of the Attorney General of New York to the effect that
between 5,000 and 15,000 of New York City's 300,000 high school
students were drug addicts. To supplement the stock figures,
these articles included the testimony of witnesses who described
their own acts of prostitution and thievery, the loss of
educational opportunities, the death of addicts from &quot;hot
shots,&quot; the horrors of withdrawal, and a wide variety of
other aspects of drug abuse. </p>

<p>This evidence of increasing use of narcotics, especially among
the young, and the fear that narcotics use would continue to
spread, presented a problem that Congress felt needed a quick and
effective solution. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>2. The Solution: Harsher Penalties</b> </p>

<p>In the same way that the congressional hearings,
investigations and debates reflect the impetus for enactment of
the Boggs Act, they also reveal the official and public consensus
as to the solution-harsher penalties. Perhaps Commissioner
Anslinger best described the prevailing climate when he stated: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Short sentences do not deter. In districts where we get
    good sentences the traffic does not flourish.... </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>There should be a minimum sentence for the second offense.
    The commercialized transaction, the peddler, the smuggler,
    those who traffic in narcotics, on the second offense if
    there were a minimum sentence of 5 years without probation or
    parole, I think it would just about dry up the traffic.10 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement before the Committee was quoted by
Representative Boggs during the congressional debate on his bill,
along with the Kefauver Committee's recommendation that
&quot;mandatory penalties of imprisonment of at least 5 years
should be provided for second offenders.&quot; 11 Representative
Boggs indicated that his bill was to incorporate the Kefauver
Committee recommendations of mandatory minimum sentences for drug
peddlers and had as its principal purpose ... to remove the power
of suspension of sentence and probation in the cases of second
and subsequent offenders against the narcotics and marijuana
laws, and to provide minimum sentences .... 12 </p>

<p>Moreover, Representative Boggs and others supported the
mandatory minimum sentences because they felt some federal had
been lax in enforcing the narcotic laws 13 and because they
believed harsher penalties had reduced crimes, particularly
kidnapping and the white slave trade, in other areas.14
Representative Edwin Arthur Hall of New York urged substitution
of his bill, which provided for minimum sentences of 100 years
for dope peddlers.15 Although there was some opposition to the
Boggs Act, notably by Representative Celler, who thought that the
mandatory minimum sentence provision would be unjust for
addicts,16 the majority opinion was clearly that mandatory
minimum sentences were necessary to insure punishment of
peddlers.17 In response to Mr. Celler's contention that young
addicts could be subjected to long prison terms because of the
loss of judicial discretion in sentencing, Representative Jenkins
stated: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The enforcing officers will always have sympathy for the
    unfortunate consumer, especially if he is harmless. These
    enforcing officers are going to protect the little boys and
    little girls. They are not going to drag the high school boys
    and girls before the criminal courts until they know that
    they are collaborating with the peddlers18 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Boggs presented a more reasonable justification for
mandatory minimums: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>[I]t is not the intention of this legislation to affect a
    teen-ager or any such person who has possession of narcotics.
    But the gentleman also knows that if we try to make a
    distinction between possession and peddling that we
    immediately open the law to all types of abuses.19 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Act as passed provided uniform penalties for violations of
the Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act and the Marihuana Tax
Act. The penalties prescribed were: </p>

<p>First offense 2 - 5 years </p>

<p>Second offense 5 - 10 years </p>

<p>Third and subsequent offenses 10 - 20 years </p>

<p>Fine for all offenses $2,000.00 </p>

<p>The relatively low fines reflected a congressional belief that
monetary penalties were an insignificant deterrent.20 An
essential provision of the Act removed judicial discretion in
sentencing by providing that upon conviction for a second or
subsequent offense the imposition or execution of the sentence
could not be suspended nor probation granted. As in the nontax
predecessors of the Boggs Act since 1909 and the Marihuana Tax
Act, possession of a narcotic drug was sufficient for conviction
unless the defendant could explain the possession to the
satisfaction of the jury.21 </p>

<hr>

<p><b>3. Marijuana and the Boggs Act</b> </p>

<p>Congressional and public attention was clearly focused on hard
narcotics use, primarily the opiates. Judging from the recorded
proceedings, especially the floor debate in the House, marijuana
seems to have been along for the ride, much as it had been during
enactment of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act. However, here there
was a conscious decision to include marijuana violations in the
new penalty provisions. Underlying this decision were
determinations that marijuana use had also increased during the
later 1940's, that it too was spreading to white teenagers, and
that the drug's dangers, warranted the harsh treatment
contemplated by the Act. </p>

<p>(a) Increased Use.-To test the allegation of an increase in
marijuana use during this period, we have used the seizure and
enforcement figures used by the proponents of the legislation.
These figures tend to sustain the hypothesis that marijuana
traffic increased from 1948 to 1951, following a decline
throughout the early 40's. However, the figures are also
consistent with other hypotheses, for example that improved
enforcement techniques and increased state-federal cooperation
had increased arrests. </p>

<p>Federal agents of the Narcotics Bureau began vigorously
enforcing the Marihuana Tax Act almost as soon as President
Roosevelt signed it into law. From October 1 to December 31,
1937, alone, the FBN made 369 seizures totaling 229 kilograms of
the drug.22 </p>

<p>Moreover, state officials made extensive seizures either in
conjunction with FBN agents or in pursuance of their newly-passed
state controls over marijuana's Marijuana seizures by federal
authorities hit their low point in 1945 when only 257 kilograms
were taken, 128 of which were seized by the FBN and the rest by
United States Customs agents .24 At this time the FBN had
approximately 180 agents.25 This low seizure figure suggests a
decrease in marijuana use throughout the early 1940 's.26 </p>

<p>Beginning in about 1948, however, the arrest and seizure 27
figures rose dramatically, the arrest figures rising 33 percent
from 1947 to 1948. These figures tend to corroborate the
Commissioner's assertion that there was a drastic increase in
narcotics use between 1948 and 1951 28 and to justify the
simultaneous calls for amendment of the narcotics and marijuana
laws.29 On the other hand, these figures could reflect increased
or I improved enforcement. For example, in 1949 the FBN had begun
to encourage the largest cities to form special narcotics squads
to deal especially with the drug problem.30 By 1951, however,
only New York and Los Angeles had formed the separate police
detail the FBN had requested .31 Thus even if one were tempted to
try to correct for improvements in the law enforcement machinery,
the seizure figures for the late 40's and 50's do sustain the
notion that the traffic in marijuana increased from 1948 to 1951.
</p>

<p>(b) Youthful Users.-As with the hard narcotics, Congress was
especially alarmed by the alleged spread of marijuana to white
teenagers and school children. Militating against this
proposition is evidence that marijuana use was not widespread
among the young as late as 1944. In that year, the famous La
Guardia Report reached the following conclusions among others:
Marijuana use was widespread in the Borough of Manhattan but
tended to be limited to certain areas, notably Harlem; the
majority of marijuana smokers were Negroes and Latin-Americans,
and marijuana smoking was not widespread among school children
.32 </p>

<p>The La Guardia study portrays marijuana use in this period as
a rather casual adjunct to ghetto life. Since it was not costly,
this euphoriant was well within the reach of ghetto residents. It
appears that throughout the early 40's marihuana use in the West
as well as in the East continued to be associated with the ethnic
minorities, especially in the inner city.33 </p>

<p>The fear that marihuana use would spread to white teenagers is
one that has recurred since the earliest legislative cognizance.
In fact, it was probably a factor in the early opium laws .34 We
have been unable to confirm whether the fear was justified at
this time, but in light of the documentation of increased
narcotics use among the young, we shall presume the same use
patterns to be true of marihuana. </p>

<p>(c) The Danger: A New Rationale.-The FBN had begun its
educational campaign for harsher marihuana penalties immediately
after passage of the Tax Act.&quot; In the early years, the
campaign was particularly effective with judges. For example, in
one of the first cases under the Tax Act, a Colorado judge
stated: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I consider marihuana the worst of all narcotics-far worse
    than the use of morphine or cocaine. Under its influence men
    become beasts, just as was the case with [the defendant].
    Marihuana destroys life itself. I have no sympathy With those
    who sell this weed. In the future I will impose the heaviest
    penalties. The Government is going to enforce this new law to
    the letter.36 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The crime, pauperism and insanity rationale was accepted
unquestioningly as late as 1951.37 Under this rationale, harsher
penalties were certainly as imperative for marijuana offenders as
they were for opiate offenders. However, in a paper filed as an
exhibit to the hearings38 on the Boggs Act, Dr. Harris Isbell,
Director of Research at the Public Health Service hospital in
Lexington, Kentucky, exploded the traditional rationale. He
stated that marijuana was not physically addictive.39 Although he
postulated a definition of addiction which amounts to nothing
more than chronic intoxication 40 and noted the possibility of
&quot;temporary psychoses&quot; in &quot;predisposed
individuals,&quot; Isbell's description of marijuana was
extraordinarily favorable. Before the Kefauver Committee he
testified: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Marijuana smokers generally are mildly intoxicated,
    giggle, laugh, bother no one, and have a good time. They do
    not stagger or fall, and ordinarily will not attempt to harm
    anyone. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>It has not been proved that smoking marijuana leads to
    crimes of violence or to crimes of a sexual nature. Smoking
    marijuana has no unpleasant after-effects, no dependence is
    developed on the drug, and the practice can easily be stopped
    at any time. In fact, it is probably easier to stop smoking
    marijuana cigarettes than tobacco cigarettes. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>In predisposed individuals, marijuana may precipitate
    temporary psychoses and is, therefore, not an innocuous
    practice with them.41 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr. Isbell's statements that marijuana does not cause a
physical dependence were supported by other doctors, 42 prison
officials,43 and perhaps most significantly by the statement of a
number of narcotics addicts .44 </p>

<p>Despite this testimony the legislators approved greatly
increased penalties for marijuana users. The crucial reason for
this severe treatment can be seen in the following colloquy
during the House subcommittee hearings: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Mr. Boggs. From just what little I saw in that
    demonstration, I have forgotten the figure Dr. Isbell gave,
    but my recollection is that only a small percentage of those
    marijuana cases was anything more than a temporary degree of
    exhilaration .... </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Mr. Anslinger. The danger is this: Over 50 percent of
    those young addicts started on marijuana smoking. They
    started there and graduated to heroin; they took the needle
    when the thrill of marijuana was gone.45 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many others -doctors ,46 crime prevention experts,47 police
and narcotics bureau officials48 -testified to the link between
marijuana use and ultimate heroin addiction. Representative Boggs
himself summed up this novel danger of marijuana in one of the
few statements even to mention marijuana in House floor debate: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Our younger people usually start on the road which leads
    to drug addiction by smoking marijuana. They then graduate
    into narcotic drugs-cocaine, morphine, and heroin. When these
    younger persons become addicted to the drugs, heroin, for
    example, which costs from $8 to $15 per day, they very often
    must embark on careers of crime . . . and prostitution . . .
    in order to buy the supply which they need.49 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The passage of this new Federal Act marked a significant shift
in rationale for the illegal status of marijuana; that status
became more entrenched by the indiscriminate lumping of marijuana
with the other narcotic drugs. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>4. The State Response: Mindless Escalation</b> </p>

<p>While the Boggs Act was still pending in Congress, the Bureau
of Narcotics encouraged the states to modify their existing
narcotic and marijuana legislation to enact &quot;penalties
similar to those provided for in the Boggs bill [which] would be
of material assistance in the fight against the narcotic
traffic.&quot; 50 Seventeen states (including Virginia) and the
Territory of Alaska responded by passing &quot;little Boggs
Acts&quot; by 1953, and eleven other states increased their
penalties by 1956. </p>

<p>In 1951, seven states and the Territory of Alaska passed
penalty provisions similar to those contained in the Boggs
Act.,51 In addition, nine other states amended their drug laws to
provide for more severe penalties, but the provisions were
neither uniform nor identical to those provided for under the
federal measure. 52 In 1952, four more states, including
Virginia, amended the penalty provisions of their drug laws to
bring them in line with the Boggs Act.53 Six more states followed
suit in 1953.54 Finally, in 1955 and 1956 two states, Ohio and
Louisiana respectively, enacted penalty provisions which were
substantially more severe than those passed previously in any
Jurisdiction.55 </p>

<p>The Virginia &quot;little Boggs Act&quot; was signed into law
on April 1, 1952 ,56 after having passed both houses
unanimously.57 The measure was regarded as routine, and as one of
the &quot;less controversial&quot; proposals to come before the
legislature during the 1952 session.58 It cleared the House on a
day when bills were being passed &quot;at the rate of about one a
minute during some periods&quot; 59 and won Senate approval
during the final rush to complete business in the waning hours of
the 1952 General Assembly. </p>

<p>The Act produced three basic changes in Virginia's scheme of
narcotics control. It added marijuana to those drugs whose sale
was forbidden under the state's version of the Uniform Narcotic
Drug Act; it created the new substantive crime of sale to a
minor; and it provided for harsher penalties for violations of
the drug laws.60 </p>

<p>Prior to 1952, the Virginia anti-marijuana provision was
separate from those provisions governing the sale of
&quot;hard&quot; drugs. But the 1952 Act repealed this provision
and included marijuana under the state's general narcotic control
law. As a result, a person illegally selling marijuana became
subject to the same penalties imposed upon a person legally
vending such drugs as heroin, morphine and cocaine .61 </p>

<p>The heart of the 1952 Act was the provision for stiffer
penalties for the violation of Virginia's general narcotic laws
prohibiting the sale of drugs without a prescription. For the
first offense, the penalty was imprisonment in the penitentiary
for not less than three nor more than five years plus a fine of
not more than $1,000. For the second offense, the penalty was
imprisonment for not less than five nor more than ten years and a
fine of not more than $2,000. For the third and succeeding
offenses, the penalties were fines of not more than $3,000 and
imprisonment for not less than ten nor more than twenty years. </p>

<p>The 1952 Act also made it a felony to sell, barter, peddle,
exchange or otherwise dispense marijuana or any other narcotic
drug to a minor. Any person found guilty of such offense was
subject to imprisonment for a term of not less than ten years nor
more than thirty years, no part of which could be suspended, and
a fine of not more than $ 1,000 for the first offense, $2,000 for
the second offense and $3,000 for the third and subsequent
offenses. Such a provision exemplifies the increased
sophistication of anti-narcotic legislation during the 1950's.
Thus, the continued escalation of penalties for drug law
violators was followed in Virginia. Moreover, despite the public
concern and attention in the national media, in Virginia it is
plain that the 1952 amendments to the narcotic laws passed
virtually unnoticed in the press .62 </p>

<hr>

<p><b>B. The Late 1950's: Another Escalation of the Penalties</b>
</p>

<p>Whether because use had decreased or because the propagandists
had accomplished their main mission, the narcotics problem
dropped almost entirely from public view after the Boggs Act was
passed. Nevertheless, state and federal police authorities, armed
with data suggesting that the strengthening of the drug laws had
at least halted the increase in drug use, pressed for further
increases in penalties in order entirely to root out the drug
menace. 63 Without significant debate or public interest,
Congress responded by passing the Narcotic Control Act of 1956
.64 </p>

<p>Although the legislators paid even less attention to marijuana
than they had in 1951, the precedent there established of
classifying marijuana with hard narcotics resulted in a
proliferation of marijuana offenses and a further increase in
penalties. In some ways, this legislation represents the
high-water mark of uninformed public policy regarding marijuana.
In almost every respect, the provisions of the Act and the
legislative motivation bear absolutely no rational relation to
marijuana's pharmacology and to the drug's actual use and traffic
patterns. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>I. Provisions of the Narcotic Control Act of 1956</b> </p>

<p>Public Law 728, an act intended to make more effective control
of the narcotic drugs and marijuana, was approved on July 18,
1956. It amended the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and the
Narcotic Drugs Import and Export ACt65 primarily in the direction
of increasing still further the penalties for violation of those
acts and proliferating the scope of federal control over the use,
possession and sale of narcotic drugs and marijuana. </p>

<p>The new law raised the potential fine for all narcotics and
marijuana offenses to $20,000 66 and increased the mandatory
minimum sentences for offenses in the prescription, registration
and possession categories to two, five and ten years for
successive offenses.67 No distinction was made between addicts
and traffickers with regard to these types of violations.
Violations of the sale, transfer and smuggling provisions of the
Act carry a minimum sentence of five years for first offenses and
ten years for all subsequent offenses. 68 In this connection the
Act created a new offense by prohibiting illegal importation of
marijuana and forbidding knowing receipt, concealment, purchase,
sale, and facilitation of transportation or concealment of such
illegally, imported marijuana .69 Simple possession was by
statute sufficient evidence of guilt to convict.70 This
provision, now 21 U.S.C.  176a, paralleled a similar
importation provision for narcotics originally passed in 1909. </p>

<p>In addition, any sale or transfer of any drug by an adult to a
was made punishable by a minimum ten-year sentence.71 Finally,
the Act made suspension, probation and parole unavailable to all
offenders except those convicted of a first offense for
possession, prescription or registration.72 </p>

<p>In addition to the increases in offenses and penalties, the
law contained wide variety of provisions relating to enforcement.
Customs and Narcotics Bureau agents were authorized to carry
weapons and to make arrests without a warrant on belief that a
drug violation had been committed .73 The Government was allowed
to appeal unfavorable decisions suppressing evidence74 and to
compel testimony from witnesses by a grant of immunity.75 In a
concession to those legislators who favored a wiretapping
provision, the new law created a category of offense based on the
use of communications instrumentalities in violation of the drug
laws.76 This provision carried penalties of a minimum two-year
sentence and up to a $5,000 fine. The Act required that citizens
who are drug users and drug law violators must register with the
immigration authorities upon entering or leaving the United
States .77 The Act also amended the Immigration and Nationality
Act to provide for deportation of alien drug users and drug law
violators .78 </p>

<hr>

<p><b>2. Marijuana-Along for the Ride</b> </p>

<p>The Narcotic Control Act of 1956 was premised on the same
beliefs as was the Boggs Act. Few if any of the legislators
recognized that marijuana was in any way different from the
physically addictive narcotics.79 The stepping stone concept was
now so widely accepted that only once during the extensive
congressional debates on the House and Senate versions of the
bill was the subject of marijuana as a separate substance even
raised. In a statement reflecting both ignorance of the basic
characteristics of marijuana and naive acceptance of the stepping
stone concept, Senator Daniel, Chairman of the Senate
subcommittee that investigated the drug problem, described
marijuana: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>That is a drug which starts most addicts in the use of
    drugs. Marihuana, in itself a dangerous drug, can lead to
    some of the worst crimes committed by those who are addicted
    to the habit. Evidently, its use leads to the heroin habit
    and then to the final destruction of the persons addicted.80 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because Congress bought the FBN's propaganda lock, stock and
barrel, it is not surprising that there was no dissent from the
proposition that harsher penalties were the means to eliminate
illicit use and sale of all drugs.81 </p>

<hr>

<p><b>3. Trafficking Patterns</b> </p>

<p>The 1956 Act reflected an unsupported conception of the nature
of the marijuana traffic. Under the assumption that
&quot;peddlers&quot; of all drugs, marijuana included, are
controlled by organized crime, the Act assessed extremely heavy
penalties for sale, especially to minors. For example, the House
Ways and Means Committee report noted that &quot;narcotic
traffickers ... are in most cases well organized professional
racketeers.&quot; 82 Similarly, in recommending prohibition of
probation or suspension of sentence for first-offender peddlers,
the House subcommittee had asserted that if the first offender
peddler problem was not solved, there would eventually be
&quot;large scale recruiting of our youth by the upper echelon of
traffickers.&quot; 83 </p>

<p>While the reference to organized crime was undoubtedly valid
with respect to hard drugs, the assumption that marijuana traffic
was controlled by large-scale racketeers was completely
unsupported. The marijuana distribution pattern today is far
different than the distribution pattern for &quot;hard&quot;
drugs. On college campuses today, the marijuana seller is likely
to be a smoker who has a small amount he wants to sell. Unless
one is to believe that organized crime has abdicated a
distribution role to &quot;amateurs,&quot; it is difficult to
imagine that it controlled the distribution of marijuana in 1956.
Accordingly, the 1956 Act's widely divergent treatment of sale
and use of marijuana may not have been justified at the time of
enactment, and it certainly makes little sense today. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>4. Origin and Use</b> </p>

<p>A related misconception about the marijuana trade concerns the
new importation offenses. Underlying the presumption of knowing
concealment of smuggled marijuana arising from possession are two
findings that the mainstay of marijuana traffic is imported from
Mexico and that possessors are likely to be aware of that fact.
Even in 1956, such findings were dubious.84 As to the presumption
of importation, Commissioner Anslinger's estimate that 90 percent
of all marijuana seized by federal authorities had been smuggled
from Mexico85 was grossly misleading. The Federal Bureau of
Narcotics had practically abandoned the responsibility for
marijuana control to increasingly effective state narcotics
squads and to the Customs agents.86 Of course, federal figures
taken alone would suggest a high percentage of importation.
Furthermore, the Commissioner's conclusion was inconsistent with
an essential premise of the Tax Act87 and with other materials
before the Congress,88 all of which emphasized the large degree
of domestic cultivation. </p>

<p>As to the possessor's knowledge, the underlying assumption
again was that there was an organized trade pattern so that each
user knew where his drug came from. As we know, marijuana was
then a casual adjunct to ghetto life. It was a social, rather
than an economic, phenomenon limited almost exclusively to
unemployed or menially employed members of racial minorities in
the center cities.89 As applied to such a class of people, the
presumption is farcical.90 </p>

<hr>

<p><b>5. Enforcement Patterns</b> </p>

<p>Although the proliferation of federal offenses suggests on its
face that state enforcement was inadequate to cope with marijuana
trade or that increased use of the drug presaged increased
narcotics addiction, nothing could be farther from the truth.
Considering marijuana alone, the 1956 legislation was passed in
response to no need at all. The enforcement statistics confirm
our hypothesis that marijuana was simply &quot;along for the
ride.&quot; </p>

<p>First, as we noted above, federal arrests declined continually
after 1952.91 Although attributable in part to increased state
enforcement92 and to a conscious FBN decision to concentrate on
narcotics, the figures do suggest a decline in or at least a
stabilization of marijuana use by the middle fifties, even in
areas in which narcotics use continued unabated. Second, the
class of users does not seem to have changed at all during this
period. Arrest statistics still indicate that use was centered in
the ghetto areas of major cities93 in California, Texas,
Louisiana, Michigan, New York, and Illinois.94 However, because
statistics were not refined according to race, age, sex and often
even the drug used,95 we cannot state categorically that there
was no change in use patterns. 96 </p>

<hr>

<p><b>6. The Epitome of Irrationality: Virginia's 1958 Amendment</b>
</p>

<p>In 1958, Virginia's Uniform Drug Act was further amended to
make the &quot;possession of illegally acquired narcotic drugs
[which included marijuana] in any quantity greater than
twenty-five grains, if in solid form, or eight ounces, if in
liquid form,&quot; a crime punishable by a fine of not more than
$5,000 and imprisonment for not less than twenty nor more than
forty years .97 The effect of this enactment was to provide a
penalty for illegal possession that was more than twice as severe
as the penalty for unlawful sale and one and one-half times more
stringent than that for sale to a minor. It is incredible that
despite the extreme <a name="last">harshness of this penalty, the
measure passed both houses of the General Assembly with but one
dissenting vote, and no mention was made of it in the Richmond
Times-Dispatch during the period of February 14 to April 7, 1958.</a>
</p>

<p>In conclusion, the Federal Narcotic Control Act of 1956 and
subsequent state legislation reflect the same basic congressional
and public misconceptions about the nature and dangers of
marijuana that characterized the early fifties. Even more
unchanged, and in fact strengthened by results under the Boggs
Act, was the assumption that the key to the solution of the
narcotic drug problem was the imposition of harsher penalties on
both users and traffickers in illicit drugs. Classification of
marijuana with narcotic drugs was now a foregone conclusion. In
fact, legislators seemed less aware that marijuana was a distinct
substance than they had been in 1951. </p>

<p>32 The conclusions of the <a href="../lag/lagmenu.htm">La
Guardia Report</a> are discussed in THE MARIHUANA PAPERS 277-410
(D. Solomon ed. 1966). The thirteen conclusions on the sociology
of marijuana use are so significant we include them in full: </p>

<p>From the foregoing study the following conclusions are drawn: </p>

<p>1. Marihuana is used extensively in the Borough of Manhattan
but the problem is not as acute as it is reported to be in other
sections of the United States. </p>

<p>2. The introduction of marihuana into this area is recent as
compared to other localities. </p>

<p>3. The cost of marihuana is low and therefore within the
purchasing power of most persons. </p>

<p>4. The distribution and use of marihuana is centered in
Harlem. </p>

<p>5. The majority of marihuana smokers are Negroes and
Latin-Americans. </p>

<p>6. The consensus among marihuana smokers is that the use of
the drug creates a definite feeling of adequacy. </p>

<p>7. The practice of smoking marihuana does not lead to
addiction in the medical sense of the word. </p>

<p>8. The sale and distribution of marihuana is not under the
control of any single organized group. </p>

<p>9. The use of marihuana does not lead to morphine or heroin or
cocaine addiction and no effort is made to create a market for
these narcotics by stimulating the practice of marihuana smoking.
</p>

<p>10. Marihuana is not the determining factor in the commission
of major crimes. </p>

<p>11. Marihuana smoking is not widespread among school children.
</p>

<p>12. Juvenile delinquency is not associated with the practice
of smoking marihuana. </p>

<p>13. The publicity concerning the catastrophic effects of
marihuana smoking in New York City is unfounded. Id. at 307. </p>

<p>33 The New York trend was also typical of Los Angeles.
California Division of Narcotic Enforcement, Marijuana-Our Newest
Narcotic Menace, April 11 1940, at 12. See also Note, Youth and
Narcotics, 1 U.C.L.A. L. Rev. 445, 453 (1954) (reporting a
breakdown by race of narcotics arrests by the Oakland police
department). </p>

<p>34 For example, in 1895 New York had passed a statute, ch.
1041, 5 1, [1895 ] N.Y. Laws 972, requiring instruction in public
schools on the effect of narcotics. </p>

position on the drug user as a criminal before he becomes an
addict, see Recidivism on Narcotic Law Violators, in Traffic in
Opium for each year. </p>

the House Comm. on Ways and Means. 82d Cong., 1st Sess. 147
(1951) [hereinafter cited as Boggs Act Hearings). </p>

<p>39 Dr. Isbell's paper stated: </p>

<p>Any definition [of addiction] which makes dependence an
essential feature will also not include intoxications with such
substances as cocaine, marijuana, and amphetamine. because
dependence on these substances is no more marked than is
dependence on tobacco and coffee and yet, in some ways,
intoxication with cocaine or marijuana is more harmful than is
addiction to morphine. Furthermore, definitions which exclude
cocaine and marijuana from the list of addicting drugs would
cause endless confusion because, in common parlance and legally,
both drugs arc regarded as addicting. </p>

(statements of three addicts). See also id. at 190, 204 for
statements by addicts to the effect that upon Moving from
marijuana to hard drugs they did not know that the Latter were
addictive. The implication is clear that marijuana is not
addictive. See id. at 91. </p>

Hearings 62. </p>

<p>49 97 CONG. REC. 8197-98 (1951). The linkage of marijuana use
to heroin was also supplied by sonic of the testimony by addicts
themselves. Of 27 addicts interviewed in part 14 of the Kefauver
Committee Hearings, 15 testified that they had started their drug
use with marijuana. This figure is misleading because a
substantial majority of the 12 who had not used marijuana were
addicts because of illness or were older addicts who had begun
using drugs before marijuana was readily available. See Kefauver
Committee Hearings, pt. 14, at 11, 29, 54, 62, 71, 84, 93, 99,
104, 108, 153, 157, 160, 162, 167, 171, 182, 189, 194, 203, 211,
216, 220, 367, 380, 432, 436. Approximately 5 of the addict
witnesses indicated that marijuana did in fact lead to the use of
the harder drugs but only one gave definite reasons why he
thought this transition inevitably took place. One male addict,
after stating that the average age of marijuana smokers was 13 or
14, stated: </p>

<p>You would very seldom find a person smoking marijuana who does
just that, he keeps on, and he gets to the point where he does
not have the same drive or feeling that he first had, and it is
like a stepping stone, he graduates to heroin. Kefauver Committee
Hearings, pt. 14, at 199-200. </p>

<p>Note that among many of these addicts curiosity and peer group
pressure was the primary factor in starting them into the use of
hard drugs. Id. at 12, 32, 94, 109, 254. Moreover, Representative
Boggs introduced some mystery into his statements during the
House debates by stating: </p>

<p>A study in February of 1950 of 602 case reports indicates that
53 percent . . . started their addiction to drugs by reason of
association with other addicts, and 7 percent of them started on
marijuana. </p>

<p>97 CONG. REC. 8197 (1951). This study is cited on the same
page with Representative Boggs' statement that our young people
usually start on the road to drug addiction by smoking marijuana.

<p>62 See also Proffit, An Analysis of the Missouri Narcotic Drug
Laws, 17 Mo. L. REV. 252 (1952), in which the author shows that
narcotic hysteria was closely linked to the general hysteria and
&quot;Red Scare&quot; of the early fifties: &quot;The opinion has
been advanced that the recent upsurge in consumption [of drugs]
is fostered by Communists in an effort to undermine the morals of
our youth.&quot; Id. at 252-53. He cites a Missouri official who
so testified before a state legislative committee. For more of
the same, see W. OURSLER &amp; L. SMITH, NARCOTICS: AMERICA'S
PERIL 266 (1952). The Missouri case parallels the Virginia data
in that great public concern is expressed about the possible
spread of narcotics addiction but little if any separate notice
was given marijuana. Everywhere the narcotics evil was linked by
veiled references to international communism, especially that of
China, the traditional home of the opium habit. </p>

<p>79 The House Subcommittee on Narcotics, which produced what
became the essentials of the Narcotic Control Act of 1956,
revealed its knowledge of the distinction between marijuana and
narcotics solely by a footnote to the major heading
&quot;Narcotics&quot; which stated in fine print that the term
narcotics included marijuana. See U.S. CODE CONG. &amp; Am News
3294 (1956). </p>

<p>80 102 GONG. REC. 9015 (1956). </p>

<p>81 Representative Boggs, father of the Boggs Act and Chairman
of the Subcommittee on Narcotics of the House Ways and Means
Committee, stated that '[e]ffective steps to eliminate the
unlawful drug traffic requires ... the imposition of severe
punishment by the courts.&quot; Id. at 10689. The subcommittee,
which had set out to determine the effect of the Boggs Act on
narcotics traffic, U.S. CODE CONG. &amp; AD. News 3291 (1956),
began its recommendations with calls for further increases in the
penalties for narcotics law violations. Id. at 3309. In fact, the
subcommittee felt that this was the only way to eliminate the
drug menace, and recommended that educational programs on the
evils of narcotics not be instituted in the schools for fear of
exciting the curiosity of young people. Id. at 3305. Both the
House Ways and Means Committee report and the subcommittee report
are filled with statements to the effect that harsher penalties
are the most effective weapons in the war against illicit
narcotics. Id. at 3281-3303 passim. The Ways and Means Committee
conclusion was succinct: &quot;Experience with the Boggs law . .
. has clearly demonstrated the efficacy of severe punishment in
reducing the illicit commerce in drugs.&quot; Id. at 3286. </p>

<p>Finally, Senator Daniel, speaking for the Senate subcommittee
investigating the drug situation in the United States, found
&quot;it absolutely necessary for the Congress of the United
States to strengthen the hands of our law enforcement officers
and provide higher penalties if we are to stop the narcotics
traffic in this country.&quot; 102 CONG. Rec. 9014 (1956). His
subcommittee also recommended the kind of across-the-board
increases in penalties that the Act eventually contained. </p>

<p>82 U.S. CODE CONG. &amp; AD. News 3283 (1956); see id. at
3302. </p>

<p>83 Id. at 3304. </p>

<p>84 In holding unconstitutional the presumption of knowledge
that marijuana was smuggled, the Supreme Court in Leary v. United
States, 395 U.S. 6 (1969), relied on the change in use patterns
from 1959 to 1967. We think the presumption was unconstitutional
when passed in 1956, both as to importation and knowledge. </p>

<p>85 Daniel Committee Hearings 18. </p>

<p>86 The decline in the number of FBN arrests and seizures is
directly related to the increase in local and state enforcement
personnel. This thesis is supported by data from California where
statewide arrests soared while federal arrests remained stable.
Bureau of Criminal Statistics, California Dep't of Justice, Crime
in California (1956). See also A. LiNDESMITH, THE ADDICT AND THE
LAW 238 (1963). One commentator has suggested that except for the
years immediately after the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act,
when the Bureau wanted to concentrate on its newly acquired
enforcement field, the FBN arrest data show clearly its emphasis
on the hard narcotics. Mandel, Problems with Official Drug
Statistics, 21 STAN. L. REV. 991, 1019-20 (1969). </p>

<p>87 See note 20 at p. 1053 supra. </p>

<p>88 Written materials inserted into the record of the Senate
hearings included the testimony of an experienced federal Customs
official that high quality marijuana was being grown near the
Texas cities of Laredo and Brownsville. Daniel Committee Hearings
3488-89. In addition, the Attorney General of Ohio noted that
marijuana may grow unnoticed along roadsides and vacant lots in
many parts of the country.&quot; Id. at 4814. Also, a bulletin
issued by the Philadelphia Police Academy recited that
&quot;[plenty of marijuana is found growing in this city.&quot;

<p>90 This is especially true with respect to the young and black
minorities. The presumption has validity only as applied to
recently immigrated Mexicans. Cf. Chein, The Status of
Sociological and Social Psychological Knowledge Concerning
Narcotics, in NARCOTIC DRUG ADDICTION PROBLEMS 146, 155 (R.
Livingston ed. 1963). Mr. Chein reports a shift in drug use from
1930-1960 from old to young and a continued increase in the
percentage of drug users who are Black or Spanish-speaking. </p>

<p>91 The number of federal arrests for marijuana violations fell
from 1288 in 1952 to 169 in 1960. TRAFFIC IN Opium 26 (1952); id.

INTO THE LEGAL HISTORY OF AMERICAN MARIJUANA PROHIBITION</b> </p>

<h2>VII. MARIJUANA USERS IN THE COURTS: 1930-1965</h2>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having studied the evolution of legislative hostility to
marijuana from a regional phenomenon with racial overtones to a
nationwide paranoia, it is worthwhile to consider the fate of
marijuana users in the courts during this evolutionary period.
After the courts had summarily rejected the substantive
constitutional arguments, appeals in marijuana cases tended to
focus on three contentions particularly germane to drug
violations: procedural objections arising from interrelated
statutory schemes on the state and federal levels punishing
essentially the same conduct; objections to police conduct
intrinsic to victimless crimes; and objections to sufficiency of
evidence at trial. Like their legislative colleagues, state and
federal translated what they knew of the drug's mythical effects
into overt hostility. Coupled with the traditionally conservative
treatment afforded the rights of criminal defendants, especially
in state prosecutions, this judicial hostility produced
ever-lengthening sentences and few reversals. </p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4"><b>A. Statutory Fantasies: The Complications of
Federal Legislation</b></font> </p>

<p><b>1. Quadruple &quot;Jeopardy&quot; and the &quot;Killer
Weed&quot;</b> </p>

<p>When Congress passed the Marihuana Tax Act in 1937, marijuana
had already been included in the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act and
every state had enacted some form of marijuana prohibition.1 In
addition to its ostensible revenue-raising function, the Act was
obviously designed both to deter further use of the drug 2 and to
facilitate enforcement of the state laws.3 The statute assured
the availability to state prosecutors of the order forms filed
with the IRS at the time of payment of the tax. 4 Congress had
thought that the order forms and registration requirements would
develop an &quot;adequate means of publicizing dealings in
marihuana in order to tax and control the traffic
effectively.&quot;5 </p>

<p>Thus, after 1937, possession of marijuana without filing the
transfer form and paying the federal tax constituted a violation
of both state and federal law;- yet filing the form and paying
the tax would probably not have eliminated the buyer's exposure
to prosecution under state law. Indeed, compliance would probably
have readily identified the buyer to state officials. To this
unfairness the courts paid no heed, noting that exposure to state
and federal prosecution for the same act did not constitute
double jeopardy7 and that the fifth amendment did not protect
defendants from prosecution for violation of state law.8 </p>

<p>After passage of the 1956 federal narcotic drug legislation9
possession of marijuana constituted at least one, and often two,
additional crimes. First, the Narcotic Drugs Import and Export
Act was amended10 in 1956 to punish directly illegal
importation11 of marijuana or other dealings in the drug with
knowledge that it had been illegally imported. Since mere
possession was sufficient evidence to convict under the Act, 12
possession without registration and order form now constituted
three crimes, and compliance with the filing and tax provisions
would have exposed the defendant to liability under state law and
under the importation provision if the original importation was
illegal. Again the courts saw no fifth amendment violation.13
Second, another provision of the 1956 package required every
person addicted to or using narcotics or convicted of a violation
of the narcotics or marijuana laws punishable by over one year's
imprisonment to register upon leaving the country. 14 Designed to
aid the Government in identifying potential smugglers. the
statute was upheld, as a strict liability offense, 15 against a
multitude of constitutional challenges. 16 Since penalties for
marijuana possession almost uniformly exceeded one year's
imprisonment during this period, a first offense possession
conviction by either sovereign triggered the registration
provision. </p>

<p><b>2. Statutory Presumptions</b> </p>

<p>Because the federal statutes punished sale and possession of
marijuana only indirectly, each had to bridge the gap between
those acts and the technical crimes-tax violations and
importation-related acts. As a bootstrap from the federal taxing
power to a federal police power, Congress chose presumptions.
Thus, under the Marihuana Tax Act, possession plus failure to
produce the required forms was presumptive evidence of the
criminal act-failure to pay the tax17 -and the courts had no
trouble upholding this provision. 18 In addition, under the
Import and Export Act possession of marijuana constituted
presumptive evidence of illegal importation and of defendant's
knowledge of such importation.19 </p>

<p>Against a rash of attacks on the rationality of this
presumption, the lower federal courts20 noted that the Supreme
Court had upheld the same statutory language in the original
Federal Import and Export Act with respect to opium 21 and that
there was sufficient general knowledge that most marijuana was
imported from Mexico to make the presumption rational. Although
the Ninth Circuit at one time indicated that a defendant could
rebut the presumption by showing that the marijuana in his
possession was manicured and therefore more likely to have been
domestically grown,22 that court later held that such proof was
insufficient and that the defendant must also show actual
domestic production. 23 </p>

<p><b>B. Attacks on State Legislation</b> </p>

<p>Most attacks on the state statutes focused on the vagueness of
statutory terms-marijuana, however spelled, or cannabis or Indian
Hemp24 -both as a scientific matter and in terms of common
experience.25 Predictably, however, few state courts were of a
mind to inhibit legislative proscription of the &quot;killer
weed.&quot; Due in part to greatly exaggerated conceptions about
the effects of the drug26 and in part to the ease with which the
mature plant is processed for the outlawed purposes,27 the courts
construed these statutory definitions as broadly as possible 28
despite the traditional rule of strict construction of criminal
statutes. </p>

<p>With the progressive increase in the severity of penalties
which accompanied adoption of the Uniform Act in the 1930's and
1940's and the surge of amendments in the 1950's in the wake of
the Boggs Act.29 Some problems of application arose.
Interestingly enough. some courts, applied the lesser penalty
where one of two penalties could be imposed.30 Similarly many
courts tended to impose minimum sentences until the late 1950's
when they , too, lost all sense of proportion.31 </p>

<p><b>C. Procedural Defenses and Entrapment</b> </p>

<p>Statutory attacks during this period tended to reflect the
complicated interrelation of state and federal law and the
scientific imprecision of legislative drafting. These attacks
were usually rebuffed, and defendants, caught in a squeeze of
judicial and legislative hostility, had few, if any, viable
defenses based on whether or not they had violated the regulatory
scheme. Both state and federal statutes merely required the
prosecution to prove that the particular defendant was found in
possession of a substance which when chemically tested was found
to be marijuana. There were few tricky problems of proof, and the
prosecution usually had a clear case. If these offenders were
caught dead to rights on the merits, the energetic attorney had
to look elsewhere for his defense. </p>

<p>Fortunately, the exigencies of police practice in the field of
narcotics law enforcement provided a defendant's attorney with a
new area of attack-procedural irregularities in the arrest and
apprehension of his client. The possession and sale of marijuana
epitomize the crime without a victim; neither seller nor buyer is
apt to complain of the transaction. In order to promote vigorous
law enforcement in this area, the police have had to use a series
of undercover agents, surprise raids and often questionable
search and arrest techniques. Because of the nature of the
conduct they are trying to stifle, the police must intrude into a
private social relationship where none of the parties wants it-
thus, the police have found it essential to employ highly
secretive and often patently deceitful practices. It is no
coincidence that the vast developments in the law of criminal
procedure-especially in the fourth amendment area-have been
outgrowths primarily of narcotics and marijuana cases. </p>

<p><b>1. Search and Seizure</b> </p>

<p>Today the major remedy for an illegal search is exclusion of
the seized items as evidence. Some states and the federal courts
have used this exclusionary rule since early in the twentieth
century. However, before the 1961 decision in Mapp v. 0hio32
required all states to adopt this remedy, many state courts did
not exclude illegally seized evidence. In jurisdictions without
the rule, it scarcely helped the victim of an illegal search to
raise the point. So, for example, in a 1945 Louisiana case, the
court permitted introduction of marijuana seized without a
warrant from defendant's room while he was out of town .33 </p>

<p>Because of the scope permitted the searching officer, things
were not much better in jurisdictions adhering to the
exclusionary rule. In states using the rule before Mapp, the
crucial issue when the lawfulness of a search was questioned was
whether or not the search was reasonable under the
circumstances.34 One might expect, in view of the judicial
hostility toward marijuana defendants, that the reasonableness
standard provided sufficient leeway for circumvention of the
exclusionary rule in more than a few cases.35 Other end runs
around the rule were developed in the federal system and in the
states purporting to apply the rule to evidence seized in an
illegal search. First, courts upheld searches if there was
arguably an untainted source for seizure of the evidence. For
example, a court might admit marijuana seized in a concededly
illegal search where a police officer saw the marijuana before
beginning the illegal search .36 Second, in order to have
standing to assert the inadmissibility of seized items, one had
to admit the narcotics in question belonged to hirn.37 Third,
courts often permitted searches pursuant to a warrant to extend
far beyond the items named in the warrant 38 under what came to
be known as the contraband theory. This theory reasoned that
certain items could never lawfully be possessed and belonged only
to the government; thus any seizure of these items was
permissible.39 </p>

<p><b>2. Entrapment</b> </p>

<p>In order for federal and state agents to detect narcotics
traffic and use, it is essential that they infiltrate the drug
culture. Obtaining this inside information may often involve
police use of special employees - informers-or may require that
the police become directly involved in the commission of the
criminal act .40 Many defendants in narcotics cases have claimed
that they were forced into sales or purchases of narcotics by the
police or their agents. These charges led to the affirmative
defense of entrapment, first recognized in federal courts by the
Supreme Court in Sorrels v. United States.41 Since that time, the
principles of the defense, as stated in that decision, were
reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in Sherman v. United States .42
In Sherman, a government informer induced the defendant, who was
trying to quit his use of narcotics and was undergoing treatment
at a narcotics rehabilitation center, to resume his use and
supply the informer. The Court held that the conduct of the
police informer constituted entrapment. </p>

<p>The entrapment defense would seem the ideal defense tactic in
marijuana cases, because so often the defendant has been
apprehended due to some police informer or police trick .43
However, the theoretical and practical outlines of the defense
narrowly restrict its scope and make it rarely successful.
Moreover, because it may entail an admission that defendant
committed the act charged 44 it is usually the last resort. </p>

<p>From the beginning there have been two conflicting views of
the entrapment defense. The majority view has considered
entrapment an exception to the given criminal statute on the
ground that the legislature could not have intended entrapment to
fall within the statutory definitions of the crime. With this as
the theoretical justification of the defense, the inquiry focuses
on the innocence of the defendant but for the police conduct. The
practical question is whether the police merely supplied an
opportunity for a person with a preexisting prediliction to the
criminal act. In the majority view this question of fact is to be
resolved by the jury. 45 </p>

<p>Throughout the years a substantial minority position has
contended that the entrapment defense should be considered a
police control mechanism. Under this view, the focus is on the
police and their conduct rather than on the character of the
defendant. This rationale is premised on the court's supervisory
powers over tile administration of justice, and the question of
entrapment is one of law to be decided by the not by the jury.46 </p>

<p>The focus of the defense on the character of the defendant and
the use of usually unsympathetic juries to decide the issue have
greatly hindered the successfulness of the entrapment defense.
Since the defense must be raised affirmatively, the defendant
bears a heavy burden in proving that he would not have committed
the crime but for the police inducement. Thus, in Gilmore v.
United States47 the defendant was unable to carry the burden of
proving that he would not have otherwise committed the marijuana
offense. A government agent approached the defendant and
requested marijuana, but the jury found no entrapment and the
court could not declare that there was entrapment as a matter of
law. </p>

<p>With the entrapment defense, as with illegal searches, the
court has a known lawbreaker before it and for this reason is
reluctant to free him unless there is an overwhelming reason to
dismiss the charges, As a California court stated, It is not the
entrapment of a criminal upon which the law frowns . . . . &quot;
48 The focus upon the defendant and his mental state, rather than
a focus on the government enforcement practices and their
possible effect of creating a particular crime, places an
incredible burden on the defendant to try to convince the jury
that he is otherwise blameless. The use of informers and special
agents who become friendly with those suspected of dealing in
marijuana, and the use of this friendship to try to purchase
marijuana, often by supplying the cash,49 are bound to have a
detrimental effect on the lay enforcement officers as well as to
assure a slight increase in the supply of marijuana which would
otherwise not have entered the trade. Nevertheless, the defense
as presently structured remains virtually impossible for the
defendant to raise with any real hope of success.<br>
</p>

<p><b>D. The Pro Forma Trial<br>
</b></p>

<p>When the marijuana defendant had exhausted his motions for
dismissal or suppression of the evidence and was brought to
trial, he was usually in deep trouble, faced with judicial
hostility, lax methods of identification, and loose standards of
proof. Convictions were rarely reversed for any reason and
especially not for insufficient evidence. And penalties, no
matter how harsh, were never set aside. </p>

<p>The first line of defense in the marijuana trial often
involved the defendant's claim that the substance seized from him
was not really marijuana. In general, the state had no difficulty
proving the substance to be marijuana. In the important case,
expert evidence of chemical tests may have been introduced,50 but
more commonly courts permitted the testimony of police
officers,51 undercover agents and other lay witnesses52 to be
sufficient to create a question of fact for the jury to decide.
53 Thus, when chemical evidence was not introduced, juries were
strongly inclined to believe the policeman or a disinterested
prosecution witness as against the defendant.54 </p>

<p>This ease of identification combined with the uncritical
acceptance of uncorroborated testiniony,55 produced what amounted
in fact to a very low standard of proof. Thus, in a California
case, People v. Janisse,56 the conviction was upheld on the
testimony of teenage boys, though the defendant's co-workers
testified for an alibi. The evidence of rookie police officers
who later failed their civil service exams57 has been accepted
over the word of the defendant. Finally, even the testimony of
witnesses who stand to benefit only from the conviction of the
defendant has been accepted without corroboration, whether the
benefit was indirect58 or direct.59 The wisdom of allowing such
testimony by itself to be legally sufficient for a conviction is
doubtful. </p>

<p>Although in theory the state must prove the defendant's
possession was knowing,60 through the use of circumstantial
evidence the state usually encountered few problems in meeting
its burden of proof. The state was permitted to use
circumstantial evidence to link the defendant to a quantity of
marijuana, but where only circumstantial evidence existed there
must have been an instruction to the that all other reasonable
inferences of innocence had been overcome.61 For example,
behavior such as running away from police, if marijuana was found
along the path run, was sufficient to link the defendant to
possession 62 though mere proximity without other guilty behavior
was not enough to prove possession. 63 </p>

<p>Finally, judicial hostility to the &quot;morally
depraved&quot; marijuana user was so strong that often judges
condoned inflammatory statements by the prosecution to the jury
about the nature of the drug and its users. Indeed, some judges
themselves often participated in these highly emotional
statements. For example, one judge in instructing a jury
announced: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Marijuana is a vicious, demoralizing substance that robs a
    person of morality honor, integrity, decency, and all the
    virtues that are the foundation of good character and good
    citizenship. The Government is constantly engaged in an
    effort to stamp out traffic in this and in narcotic drugs.
    Officers of the Government are employed in this effort
    usually and are entitled to credit for their loyalty and
    integrity.64<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the same way, direct aspersions toward a defendant's
character were tolerated .65 For instance, courts overlooked
prosecution comments that the defendant sold his drugs near a
'junior high school&quot; or that drug use among teenagers must
be stopped .66 </p>

<p>In sum, then, defendants in marijuana cases had great
difficulties at trial during this period. Easy identification
methods, jury acceptance of uncorroborated testimony, use of
circumstantial evidence to prove defendant's possession was
knowing, and the 'judicial participation in inflammatory
statements to the jury made defense success at trial a virtual
impossibility.<br>

<p>5 With minor exceptions, the Marihuana Tax Act requires all
transactions in marijuana to be carried out by written order
form. 26 U.S.C.  4741-44 (1964). It is unlawful for a
transferor to transfer except by such form obtained by the
transferee, 26 U.S.C. S 4742 (1964), and for the transferee to
acquire, transport or conceal marijuana without filing the
transfer form, registering with the IRS and paying the applicable
transfer tax. 26 U.S.C.  4744 (a) (1964). For heretofore
unregistered persons, that tax is $100 an ounce. 26 U.S.C. 
4741 (1964). Since marijuana was excised from the United States
Pharmacopoeia, there have been few legitimate transactions by
registered persons. THE PRESIDENTS COMMISSION ON LAW ENFORCEMENT
AND ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE, REPORT: THE CHALLENGE OF CRIME IN
A FREE SOCIETY 214 (1967). Since .the tax is otherwise
prohibitive, the Act is in effect almost entirely a criminal law;
the crime is having anything to do with marijuana-possession,
sale, acquisition or importation-since proof of possession
coupled with failure, after reasonable notice and demand by the
Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate, to produce the
transfer form is &quot;presumptive evidence&quot; of guilt. 26

<p>15 Application of the statute was particularly harsh. Even
though defendant, found guilty of a drug offense and sent to the
California Youth Authority for several months, had been told upon
release that his record was clean, the court held that he had
violated the statute by failing to register. Adams v. United
States, 299 F.2d 327 (9th Cir. 1962). </p>

States v. Eramdjian, 155 F. Supp. 914 (S.D. Cal. 1957). The
courts struggled mightily with arbitrariness, vagueness, right to
travel, self incrimination, and equal protection arguments, but
upheld the statute. But cf. Russell v. United States, 306 F.2d
402 (9th Cir. 1962) (gun registration requirement

importation was a rule of evidence, not of substantive law, the
court noted that imported marijuana was ordinarily composed of
mixed twigs and stems since the growers waited until maturity
before harvesting. In the United States, on the other hand,
growers avoided police detection by picking individual leaves
before the plant matured, Since appellant possessed mixed twigs
and stems, the court upheld application of the presumption; the
clear suggestion, however, was that the presumption would not be
applied to manicured marijuana. </p>

(Dist. Ct. App. 1944), on the basis of an early holding that the
use of Latin to define a sex crime was unconstitutionally vague,
Ex parte Lockett, 179 Cal. 581, 178 P. 134 (1919) (fellatio and
cunnilingus). -In rejecting the vagueness argument, the court
held that &quot;cannabis&quot; was later explained in the statute
by the use of the word &quot;marijuana&quot; and that the two
words were synonymous. See People v. Martinez, 117 Cal. App. 2d
701, 256 P.2d 1028 (Dist. Ct. App. 1953) (&quot;Indian Hemp&quot;
not unconstitutionally vague); cf. People v. Johnson, 147 Cal.
App. 2d 417, 305 P.2d 82 (Dist. Ct. App. 1957)
(&quot;lophophora&quot; not unconstitutionally vague reference to
peyote). </p>

<p>25A related issue was whether the charge of possession of
&quot;marijuana&quot; was specific enough where there were
statutory exceptions to protect the bird seed and hemp
industries. The general rule was that the state need not allege
that the parts possessed were not within the statutory
exceptions. E.g., Simpson v. State, 129 Fla. 1279 176 So. 515
(1937). Contra, People v. Sowrd, 370 111. 140, 18 N.E.2d 176
(1938'). </p>

<p>26See, e.g., Simpson v. State, 129 Fla. 127, 131, 176 So. 515,
517 (1937) (marijuana causes erotic hallucinations, loss of
sense, false conviction, loss of values, a general weakening of
powers, making it dangerous to mind and body). In Commonwealth v.
LaRosa, 42 Pa. D. &amp; C. 34, 36-37 (Fayette County Dist. Ct.
1941), the court stated: </p>

<p>The deleterious, even vicious, qualities of the plant which
render it highly dangerous to the mind and body, upon which it
operates to destroy the will, to produce imaginary delectable
situations, and gradually to weaken the physical powers, reside
in a sticky resin of great narcotic power that pervades the
entire plant .... 27 State v. Bonoa, 172 La. 955, 136 So. 15
(1931). </p>

<p>28 See State v. Hall, 41 Wash. 2d 446, 249 P.2d 769 (1952);
Commonwealth v. LaRosa, 42 Pa. D. &amp; C. 34 (Fayette County
Dist. Ct. 1941). LaRosa held that the statute, passed two years
earlier, created a duty to cut down marijuana plants before they
could seed and that defendant had no right to plant marijuana
even if he meant to cut the plants before maturity. Defendant's
conviction for possession of two thousand mature plants and one
hundred fifty thousand immature plants was accordingly affirmed. </p>

<p>29 See pp. 1074-75 supra. </p>

<p>30 E.g., State v. Economy, 61 Nev. 394, 130 P.2d 264 (1942). </p>

<p>31 This was particularly true in the Southwest, where use
cases were more numerous and appeals more frequent. Indicative of
this trend are the following Texas cases in chronological order:
Gonzales v. State, 108 Tex. Crim. 253, 299 S.W. 901 (1928) ($25
fine); Baker v. State, 123 Tex. Crim. 209, 58 S.W.2d 534 (1933)

<p>33 State v. Shotts, 207 La. 898, 22 So. 2d 209, cert. denied,
326 U.S. 730 (1945). </p>

<p>34 See, e.g., United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U.S. 56 (1950).
The Court here upheld the search of a one-room office on the
grounds that the search was incident to a lawful arrest, and said
that the scope of such searches must turn on the reasonableness
of the search considering all the underlying circumstances. </p>

<p>35 Cf. Anderson v. State, 137 Tex. Crim. 461, 131 S.W.2d 961
(1939). See also Lea) v. State, 169 Tex. Crim. 222, 332 S.W.2d
729 (1959), holding it reasonable for a policeman to search
defendant's shorts where he suspected from an informer's tip that
the &quot;out of the ordinary bulge&quot; in defendant's pants
concealed marijuana. </p>

<p>36 Ramirez v. State, 135 Tex. Crim. 442, 125 SW.2d 597 (1938).
Eventually, courts began to allow the admission of illegally
seized evidence if there was any untainted source whatsoever.
Thus, where defendant testified that the police had found
marijuana in a dresser drawer in his house, the court permitted
the state to introduce the marijuana based on the untainted
source of defendant's own statements in court. Rao v. State, 160
Tex. Crim, 416, 271 S.W_2d 426 (1954). </p>

<p>37 See Connolly v. Medalie, 58 F.2d 629 (2d Cir. 1932). In
that case judge Learned Hand wrote: </p>

<p>Men just wince at admitting that they were the owners, or in
possession, of contraband property; may wish at once to secure
the remedies of a possessor, and avoid the perils of the part;
but equivocation will not serve. If they come as victims, they
must take on that role, with enough detail to cast them without
question. The petitioners at bar shrank from that predicament;
but they were obliged to choose one horn of the dilemma. </p>

<p>Id. at 630 </p>

<p>38 See King v. State, 169 Tex. Crim. 34, 335 SAV.2d 378
(1959). Here the Texas court held, with one dissent, that a
search warrant for the premises of the husband authorized a
search of the wife's bag in the house; her conviction for the
materials found in the bag was affirmed, </p>

<p>In the field of search incident to an arrest, courts went even
farther. Thus, a Texas court affirmed a conviction based upon the
arrest and search of a defendant, even though the police officer
admitted he had arrested the defendant solely for the purpose of
searching him. The officer ostensibly arrested the defendant for
a knife fight, but later admitted that he had arrested him
because he suspected him of possession of marijuana. The court
noted that the defendant was unable to give any authority for his
contention that the state should be bound by the officer's
statement as to the purpose of the arrest. Gonzales v. State, 160
Tex. Crim. 548, 272 S.W.2d 524 (1954). </p>

<p>39 It had been held that contraband may be seized in a search
incident to arrest although the items taken had no relationship
to the crime for which the arrest was made. Harris v. United
States, 331 U.S. 145 (1947). overruled, Chimel v. California, 395
U.S. 752 (1969). </p>

entrapment case; the government agents had arranged for the
transportation of a hag of marijuana front Texas to Chicago. The
defendant argued that the agents' activities were illegal, and
for that reason, the government was estopped from prosecuting him
and that the evidence was inadmissible. The trial court found
that the defendant had arranged for the deal and instructed the
jury to acquit if the agents had illegally caused the
importation. As in Gilmore, the jury was not willing to condemn
the police, </p>

<p><b>THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT AND THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE: AN INQUIRY
INTO THE LEGAL HISTORY OF AMERICAN MARIJUANA PROHIBITION</b> </p>

<p><font size="2"><i>Richard J. Bonnie &amp; Charles H.
Whitebread, II</i></font> </p>

<p><b>VIII. THE PUBLIC DISCOVERS THE TRUTH ABOUT MARIJUANA</b></p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;We need not belabor the point, but sometime after 1965
the wisdom of the marijuana laws suddenly became dinner-table
conversation in most American middle-class homes along with the
Indochina war and campus dissent. Many sons and daughters, and
even mothers and fathers, of the middle class had tried the drug,
and those who had not were certainly familiar with
&quot;pot&quot; and the law. The medical profession finally
commenced a research effort to determine who was right-the user
who said the drug was a harmless pleasant euphoriant or the
lawmakers, who by their actions had condemned it as a noxious
cause of crime, addiction and insanity. <br>
</p>

<p>A. Marijuana and the Masses </p>

<p>Although marijuana arrests arid seizures hit their all-time
low point in 1960,1 the middle and late sixties witnessed a
revolution in marijuana use. Vast numbers of people have recently
adopted the drug as their principal euphoriant; however, by all
estimates, the new users are the sons and daughters of the middle
class, not the ethnic minorities and ghetto residents formerly
associated with marijuana.2 Student marijuana use is now so
common that it has been associated in the public eye with the
overall campus life style.3 Accompanying the growth of widespread
marijuana use on campus has been an increasing experimentation
with the drug by intellectuals, professors, young professionals
and members of several other social groups who would never have
considered using the drug ten years ago.4 </p>

<p>Dr. Stanley F. Yolles, former Director of the National
Institute of Mental Health, testifying before a Senate
subcommittee, said, &quot;A conservative estimate of persons in
the United States, both Juvenile and adult, who have used
marihuana, at least once, is about 8 million and may be as high
as 12 million people.&quot;5 Other estimates have run as high as
twenty to twenty-five million users.6 This vast increase in the
number of people using marijuana seems to have begun in the early
and middle sixties. It is likely that this new use pattern was
initially precipitated by the publicity surrounding the LSD
experimentation of Doctors Alpert and Leary at Harvard in 1963.7
As a growing segment of the academic fringe began to preach
consciousness-expansion, students began to find marijuana
available on campus. From that point the phenomenon snowballed.
As more novice marijuana users reported no ill effects from its
use, more students tried it, and in turn those who used and
enjoyed the drug began to &quot;turn on&quot; those who had not.
By 1970, some campuses reported that over seventy percent of the
student body were users.8 More recently, marijuana use spread
beyond the student subculture; reportedly its use has become
common even among young professionals on Wall Street.9 Moreover,
since it is readily available and widely used in Vietnam,
marijuana has become popular with many soldiers.10 </p>

<p>10 D. LOURIA, THE DRUG SCENE 10 (1968). </p>

<p>The general public is clearly aware that there has been both a
vast increase in the number of users and a shift from lower- to
middle-class use of the drug. These great changes in the nature
of marijuana use have had important social consequences. First,
with the sharp rise in the number of users and the tendency of
marijuana users to share common life styles and often political
opinions, the drug has become associated ill the past few years
with a major counter-culture, Many proponents of that
counter-culture have contended that the illegal status of
marijuana -which puts large numbers of people oil the wrong side
of the criminal law-is the most significant unifying and
recruiting agent for the New Left and the other political and
social causes of the late sixties.&quot; Some New Left leaders
have gone so far as to oppose reduction in the penalties for
marijuana possession because they feel severe penalties aid their
recruiting ends by making marijuana users outraged against a
society that overacts so strongly to a nonexistent danger.&quot;
We feel the general disrespect for marijuana laws may be causing
a dangerous disrespect for all laws in a sizeable segment of the
population. The credibility of government suffers on all issues
when its handling of the use of this drug seems to so many so far
removed from reality. This opinion is supported by the increasing
medical evidence that the dangers of tile drug are de minimus. </p>

<p>Secondly, the new middle-class use of marijuana has induced
the first significant medical inquiry into the nature of the
drug; has spawned increasing numbers of challenges to the
constitutionality of marijuana laws and penalties, and has
spurred the passage of more lenient legislation. </p>

<p>One commentator has stated: </p>

<p>Nobody cared when it was a ghetto problem. Marijuana -well, it
was used by jazz musicians or the lower class, so you didn't care
if they got 2-to-20 years. But when a nice, middle-class girl or
boy in college gets busted for the same thing, then the whole
community sits up and takes notice. And that's the name of the
game today. The problem has begun to come home to roost-in all
strata of society, in suburbs, in middle-class homes, in the
colleges, suddenly, the punitive, vindictive approach was
touching- all classes of society. And now the most exciting thing
that's really happening is the change in attitude by the people.
Now we have a willingness to examine the problem, as to whether
it's an experimentation, or an illness rather than &quot;an
evil.&quot; With this change I think we can come to a more
rational approach to methods of drug control.13 </p>

<p>Without doubt, the new class of users has successfully
demanded more favorable attention from the legislatures and the
courts than the lower class could have attracted. In fact, even
the slightest circumscription of the reach of a state marijuana
law is now national news.14 </p>

<p>A third result of the widespread use of marijuana has been a
substantial challenge to the traditional picture of the national
marijuana trade. Over the past three decades, law enforcement
officials continued to convince legislators that the traffic in
marijuana was controlled by professional criminals.15 Confronted
with this portrait of the marijuana trade, legislators naturally
stereotyped the &quot;seller&quot; as the vicious criminal
pushing his wares for high profit and felt that extraordinarily
harsh penalties were justified for sellers.16 From several recent
studies it appears that the structure of marijuana traffic bears
little or no relation to the traditional stereotype. In a recent
survey of 204 users it was found that 44 percent had sold to
friends at least once. Many casual users sell to leave themselves
enough profit to cover the amount of their own use. 17 The study
further finds that even at the very top, profits are too small
and the product too bulky to interest the criminal class that
probably underwrites sales of heroin and other &quot;hard
drugs.&quot; 18 Thus even at the top, amateurs-composed generally
of the students, young professionals and soldiers who constitute
the users-are the main source of the drug.19 It is also important
to note that marijuana is typically sold by the ounce20 rather
than by the cigarette as was traditionally assumed. Thus, even
the relatively casual experimenter was likely to have at least an
ounce of the drug in his possession. </p>

<p><font size="4"><b>B. Enforcement of the Marijuana Laws:
1960-1970</b></font> </p>

<p>As a result of the rapid spread of marijuana use, full
enforcement of the marijuana laws has become impossible.21 By
1967 the Federal Bureau of Narcotics had 299 agents, roughly 50
more than in 1956.22 In the same period the use of marijuana
probably increased 1,000 fold. It seems obvious from both FBN
statistics and the best available state and local statistics that
two enforcement patterns emerged in the sixties: concentration on
&quot;sellers&quot; and selective enforcement. </p>

<p>Since 1960 the FBN and major state and municipal narcotic
squads have concentrated on the larger sellers. In the early
sixties this trend was less pronounced,23 but by 1968 the
Commissioner of the FBN said that 75 percent of federal marijuana
arrests were of dealers and that even the remaining 25 percent
were sellers but were charged with possession as a result of plea
bargains. Statistics from California show the same concentration
on sellers nevertheless the California bureau found that most of
these sellers were young and first offenders.26 Thus, at least by
1968 it became clear that sellers were quite often neophytes. </p>

<p>At the same time that the police have abandoned full
enforcement for concentration on dealers, enforcement of the laws
has remained necessarily haphazard and somewhat selective. Since
marijuana use has become so common, there are certain student and
hippy communities in which the police could arrest nearly
everyone. Here the problem of selective enforcement necessarily
arises-the police arrest those they dislike for other reasons,
either political disagreement or suspicion of use of other drugs.
This inevitable practice, although perhaps not consciously
planned, has brought outcry from some victimized communities.27
This policy-if not a policy by the police at least a perception
by the hippies-of selective enforcement has provided them
increased impetus toward the anti-establishment life style they
have adopted. Their attitude is aggravated when the police engage
in particularly aggressive tactics, such as use of informers, to
trap the offenders. 28 </p>

<p>By 1970, the unenforceability of the marijuana laws was most
clearly evidenced by the failure of President Nixon's Operation
Intercept which was designed to seal off the Mexican border and
the supply of marijuana coming into the United States from
Mexico.29 Both national and international tensions led to the
failure of the &quot;Noble Experiment.&quot; By now, the
marijuana trade is so scattered and at the same time so
fragmented (with no real hierarchy in the trade) that the
unenforceability of these laws has reached Prohibition
proportions.<br>
</p>

<p><b>C. Emergence of Medical Opinion</b> </p>

<p>One of the most significant causes of widespread middle-class
use of marijuana was the lack of any medical proof of the
allegedly evil effects of its use. In fact, what authoritative
studies had been conducted up to this time were inconsistent with
the assumptions underlying anti-marijuana legislation. In this
situation, users viewed themselves as experimenters with a mild
euphoriant, not criminals endangering themselves or society at
large. The inevitable consequence was increased medical inquiry
into the effects of the drug, beginning in about 1967.31 </p>

<p>Concurrently, the National Institute of Mental Health
significantly Increased its funding for grants and contracts for
marijuana research.32 </p>

<p>Despite this intensified inquiry, uncertainty about the
effects of the drug persists. There are several major research
obstacles responsible for continued absence of reliable research.
After outlining the impediments to conclusive findings, we shall
extract from the existing studies the present state of medical
knowledge. </p>

<p><b>1. Research Obstacles</b> </p>

<p>The major obstacle is the nature of the marijuana plant
itself. Marijana is a derivative of the plant Cannabis Sativa,
commonly denoted the hemp plant. It is classified as a dioecious
plant, that is, the male reproductive parts are on one individual
plant and the female parts are on another. The differentiation of
the male and female plants is exceedingly significant because the
chemical compounds responsible for the euphoric effect of
marijuana are found primarily in the sticky resin that covers the
unfertilized female flowers and adjacent leaves. The male plant
may contain a small amount of this active resin, but it is grown
mainly for hemp fiber.33 </p>

<p>The hemp plant yields three rough grades of intoxicating
substances, the least potent of which is &quot;marijuana.&quot;
34 Yet, because the classifications are imprecise, confusion is
engendered by attributing to &quot;marijuana&quot; the effects
produced by the excessive use of the more potent forms of
cannabis.35 In addition, the psychic potency of the plant differs
depending upon where the marijuana is grown, 36 and upon
cultivation variables such as occurrence of fertilization and
time of harvesting: </p>

<p><br>
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>If the male plants are not removed and fertilization
    occurs, the female plants which carry the main intoxicating
    properties are considerably weakened in that respect. In
    addition, unless harvesting is carried out immediately before
    the blossoming of the flowers there is further weakening and
    variation in the potency of the produce.37 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is interesting to note in this connection that the
marijuana used in the United States is among the weakest in the
world.38 These factors frustrate the creation of a standardized
dosage in any given experiment and preclude the comparison of the
results of independent studies.39 </p>

<p>In addition to the problems engendered by the great variance
in potency and dosage, meaningful marijuana research also
inhibited by differences in means of consumption. Since
standardized doses are generally considered impossible if the
drug is smoked,40 most studies, including the La Guardia Report,
are based upon oral administration of marijuana to the subjects.
Yet smoking is the method of consumption among nearly all
American users. Furthermore, standardized dosage is not even
assured by the oral method since &quot;little is known about the
gastrointestinal absorption of the highly water-soluble
cannabinals in man.&quot; 41 Finally, &quot;there is considerable
indirect evidence from users that the quality of the intoxication
is different when marijuana or its preparations are ingested
rather than smoked. In particular, ingestion seems to cause more
powerful effects . . . . &quot; 42 </p>

<p>2. Current Medical Knowledge </p>

<p>It is perhaps best to begin with the medical data concerning
the traditional allegations about marijuana. </p>

<p>(a) The Myths.-First, it is universally accepted among medical
authorities that marijuana is not physically habit-forming.43
Although some researchers have asserted that a psychological
dependence may result from continued use of the drug, this
hypothesis has not been established and its relevance has been
questioned. One authority has noted that &quot;habituation to
marihuana is not as strong as to tobacco or to alcohol.&quot; 44
Another has commented that &quot;[a] psychological dependence and
desire for the drug may occur, but this is inconsistent and is
not uncontrollable.... Perhaps the dependence is even less than
the dependence on cigarettes.&quot; 45 </p>

<p>Second, there is no evidence whatsoever that the use of
marijuana has a direct relationship to the commission of crime.
One commentator has noted that &quot; during the high the
marihuana user may say things he would not ordinarily say, but he
generally will not do things that are foreign to his nature. If
he is not normally a criminal, he will not commit a crime under
the influence of the drug.&quot; 46 In fact, it is entirely
likely that the characteristic passive reaction to the use of
marijuana tends to inhibit criminality. A recent study has shown
that juvenile &quot;potheads&quot; tend to be nonaggressive and
to stay away from trouble.47 Similarly, there is no scientific
evidence for the proposition that marijuana is an aphrodisiac. It
has been suggested to the contrary that the most potent form of
cannabis, pure ganja, has the reverse effect, being taken by
Indian priests to quell the libido.48 </p>

<p>Finally, the evidence is at best inconclusive regarding the
contention that use of marijuana leads to the use of
&quot;hard&quot; narcotics. Some of the early studies claiming to
have established a valid connection were scientifically
unreliable. One authority has observed in this regard: </p>

<p><br>
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Supposedly scientific studies of this problem have been
    conducted in the past, such as the one done in a deprived
    area of a large city where the use of heroin was widespread,
    and indicating that many users of marijuana went on to the
    use of more hazardous drugs. I am sure that without previous
    marijuana, the use of such drugs in that environment would be
    just as high, and that if such a study were done on a college
    population, it would be found that the subsequent use of
    &quot;hard&quot; drugs would be negligible.49 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Referring to a presidential task force investigation, another
authoritv has commented: </p>

<p><br>
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It is true that the Federal study showed that among heroin
    users about 50% had had experience with marijuana- the study
    also found, however, that most of the heroin addicts had been
    users of alcohol and tobacco. There is no evidence that
    marijuana is more likely than alcohol or tobacco to lead to
    the use of narcotics.50 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the basis of the available information, most authorities
have concluded that there is no scientific basis for the theory
that the use of marijuana is a causal factor in the use of
&quot;hard&quot; narcotics.51 In any event, as a matter of common
sense, it would appear that the phenomenon in dispute is very
complex, including both individual personality features and
environmental factors. As one commentator put it &quot;Several of
the studies indicate that the precious statistics have been
misleading and exaggerated.&quot; Whether or not the proposition
can be scientifically established, there is probably a slightly
greater chance that an individual who has used marijuana could go
on to opiates, but statistically this is not . . . an important
social consideration.&quot;52 </p>

<p>Thus, it appears that none of the traditional allegations
about marijuana has been scientifically established, that its
alleged addictive qualities have been disproved, and that the
overwhelming weight of authority disputes its allegedly crime
producing and stepping stone tendencies. We will now briefly
survey the medically recognized effects of the drug, physical,
psychomotor and psychological. </p>

<p>(b) Physical Effects.-The acute physical effects of marijuana
are the subject of much debate. Various studies have reached
different conclusions. Nearly all authorities, however, are in
agreement that the bodily symptoms accompanying the
&quot;high&quot; are very slight. The most commonly noted effects
are a slight rise in blood pressure, conjunctival vascular
congestion, slight elevation in blood sugar, urinary frequency
and an increase in pulse rate.53 In general, these acute symptoms
are relatively short-lived, and there are no known lasting
physical effects.54 On the other hand, there is evidence that
prolonged smoking could lead to &quot;marijuana bronchitis,&quot;
and that communal smoking has the tendency to encourage the
spread of communicable diseases. </p>

<p>(c) Psychomotor Effects.-Varying results have also been
reported in studies of the acute effects of marijuana upon
psychomotor functions. Although the researchers have sometimes
found some slight impairment in performance tests,55 there is
apparently no general depressing or stimulating effect on the
nervous system and no influence on speech and coordination.56 In
the most recent study, Doctors Well, Zinberg and Nelson of the
Boston University School of Medicine found that marijuana users
are able to compensate nearly 100 percent for whatever adverse
effects may result on ordinary psychomotor performance. 57 </p>

<p>Such findings suggest that marijuana is not likely to be a
causal factor in driving accidents, a hypothesis that is
supported by a recent simulated driving test comparing the
performance of subjects under the influence of marijuana and
alcohol.58 There seems to be no contention in the medical field
that there are any lasting effects from marijuana in the
psychomotor area. The Well study reported that noticeable effects
&quot;were diminished between 30 minutes and I hour, and they
were largely dissipated 3 hours after the end of smoking. No
delayed or persistent effects beyond 3 hours were observed or
reported.&quot; 59 </p>

<p>(d) Psychological Effects.-The acute psychological effects of
the use of marijuana are more complex. At the outset, it can be
stated with certainty that &quot;marijuana is definitely
distinguishable from other hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD, MIT,
mescaline, peyote, and psilocybin. Although it produces some of
the same effects, it is far less potent than these other drugs.
It does not alter consciousness to nearly so great an extent as
they do nor does It lead to increasing tolerance to the drug
dosage.&quot; 60 Furthermore, the subjective effects of cannabis
are dependent upon the personality of the user, his expectations,
and the circumstances under which the drug is taken, as well as
learning to smoke marijuana properly.61 </p>

<p>There is general agreement about the pleasurable psychological
effects. Users uniformly experience greatly enhanced
perception-whether real or delusory-of visual, auditory, taste
and touch effects, increased sense of humor or hilarity, feelings
of well-being or wonderment, and distorted time and space
perceptions.62 In this connection, it is interesting to note that
even the pleasurable phenomena are dependent on individual
circumstances, particularly ivlicii the drug is taken for the
first time. Many, if not most, people do not become
&quot;high&quot; on their first exposure to marijuana, even if it
is smoked correctly.63 The probable explanation for this curious
phenomenon is that repeated exposure to marijuana reduces
psychological inhibition, as part of, or as a result of, a
learning process.64 </p>

<p>Medical knowledge is most tentative with reference to adverse
psychological effects. Recent studies, however, have vehemently
disputed an earlier tendency to attribute psychoses and severe
panic reactions to marijuana use.65 As Dr. Well has noted: </p>

<p><br>
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Because reliable information about the acute effects of
    marijuana has been as scarce within the medical profession as
    without, many of these reactions have been misinterpreted and
    incorrectly treated. For example, simple panic states, which
    doubtless would be properly diagnosed in other circumstances,
    are often called &quot;toxic psychoses&quot; when doctors
    elicit immediate histories of marijuana use.66 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Medical experts now generally agree that the possibility of
depression, panic and psychoses depends entirely on the
circumstances of use and the personality of the user.67 In his
most recent study, Dr. Weil concluded that &quot;serious adverse
reactions are uncommon in the 'normal' population,&quot;68 but
noted three exceptions. First, simple depressive reactions which
rarely occur in regular users may occur in novices who approach
their initial use ambivalently.69 Second, the most frequent
adverse reaction is apprehension, more often described as
anxiety, and sometimes reaching a degree of panic. Again, such
reactions are closely related to the attitude of the user and to
the social setting.70 The social setting also influences the
frequency of panic reactions, suggesting again that this
phenomenon correlates with the degree of reluctance with which
people approach initial use of the drug: </p>

<p><br>
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In a community where marijuana has been accepted as a
    recreational intoxicant, they may be extremely rare (for
    example, one per cent of all responses to the drug). On the
    other hand, at a rural Southern college, where
    experimentation with the drug may represent a much greater
    degree of social deviance, 25 per cent of persons trying it
    for the first time may become panicked.71 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The panicked person normally believes that he is either dying
or losing his mind, and simple reassurance will end most such
reactions.72 The reaction normally is short-lived, but it may be
prolonged by an attitude encouraging the underlying fears.73 In
short, &quot;panic reactions . . . seem more nonpharmacologic
than pharmacologic.&quot;74 </p>

<p>Third, psychotic reactions occur rarely, if at all, in normal
users,75 and occur mainly in persons with a low psychosis
threshold or a history of psychosis76 or hallucinogenic drug
experimentation.77 Even in such cases, marijuana is a precipitant
rather than a primary cause of this type of reaction 78 which
lasts at most a day or two.79 <br>

The previous lack of concern with marijuana call also be observed
by 211 examination of the number of articles appearing in medical
periodicals. During the decade between 1942 and 1951, only six
articles dealing with the subject are listed in the index for
medical journals. Eleven reports were noted as being published in
the next ten years. From 1962 to 1966, an average of three
materials per year were available. It was not until 1967 that the
subject became of sufficient interest to occupy the time of a
reasonable number of medical authors. In that year, eleven
articles appeared in medical periodicals. By 1968, this number
had increased to 30, and in 1969 more than 60 articles dealing
with the topic of human marijuana consumption have appeared. In
other words, more than three times the number of articles
appeared in the last three years than in the 25 preceding years. </p>

<p>35 As long as the term marihuana is used indiscriminately to
refer to cannabis of all kinds and potencies, confusion will
continue. . . . In this country some of the vigorous opponents of
marihuana seem to foster this confusion by attributing to any use
of marihuana the effects produced primarily by the excessive use
of the more potent forms of cannabis in an attempt to preserve a
strongly negative public image of marihuana. </p>

forms is relatively uncommon, and there appears to be no demand
for them. J. ROSEVEAR, POT: A HANDBOOK OF MARIHUANA 31-33 (1967).

<p>38 Zunin, Marijuana: The Drug and the Problem, 134 MILITARY
MED. 104, M. 7 (1969). According to the author, several factors
contribute to this phenomenal: (1) The amount of resin found in
the flowering tops markedly decreases as the plants are grown in
more temperate areas. It is estimated that the resin content of
Indian cannabis is 20%; Mexican 15% or less; that grown in
Kentucky 8%; and that found in Wisconsin 6% or less. </p>

<p>(2) The activity of the resin in the female is greatly reduced
if fertilized by the male. In this country, because of an
inability to distinguish between the two plants, inattention to
cultivation and lack of knowledge, the female plants are
fertilized. (3) The resinous content is highest prior to
&quot;going to seed&quot; of the female plant. The marijuana in
this country has gone to seed prior to harvesting. </p>

<p>(4) The male plant contains little or no resin content. In
this country, the male plant is indiscriminately mixed with the
female plant in the final preparation. </p>

<p>(5) The most active portion of the plant is the flowering top.
In this country, preparations of marijuana are composed primarily
of leaves, twigs, and seeds which are crushed. </p>

<p>(6) The potency of marijuana decreases with time. It is
reduced at the end of one year, markedly reduced at the end of
two years, and nonexistent at the end of three years. In
addition, it keeps better in cold, dry climates. Most of the
marijuana in the United States is several months to several years
old by the time it has been harvested and has passed through the
smuggling operation. </p>

<p>39 Given the above variations in the plant and in its products
and extracts, together with the continuing ignorance of its
chemistry it is not surprising that it is virtually impossible to
make direct comparisons between the various studies on the
effects on human beings who are even more individually variable. </p>

<p>Schwarz, supra note 34, at 593. </p>

<p>Recently. what is believed to be the active ingredient in
marijuana has been isolated and synthesized. However, this
substance denominated (THC), is only available for research in
very limited quantities. Weil Study Furthermore, it has not been
proven that THC is the sole ingredient contributing to the
effects caused by marijuana. </p>

<p>40 &quot;[M]any pharmacologists dismiss the possibility of
giving marihuana by smoking because, they sav, the dose cannot he
standardized.&quot; Weil Study 1235. </p>

<p>43 &quot;-There is now an abundance of evidence that marihuana
is not an addictive drug. Cessation of its use produces no
withdrawal symptoms, nor does a user feel any need to increase
the dosage as he becomes accustomed to the drug.&quot; Grinspoon,

factor in criminal misconduct, but that the &quot;high&quot;
leads to sociable attitudes. </p>

have also been reported, but it is felt that these symptoms are
mainly the result of oral administration. Grinspoon, supra note
43, at 20. Increased appetite and dryness of the mouth are also
said to be common. </p>

<p>54 Usually the reports of chronic ill effects are to be found
in Eastern studies of individuals using the stronger hashish or
pure resinous substances over prolonged periods of time and are
complicated by the immeasurable effects of many other social,
economic, personality and cultural factors. Schwarz, supra note

<p>55 Tests by Robert S. Morrow in the 1930's revealed that even
large doses of marijuana did not affect performances on tests of
the speed of tapping or the quickness of response to simple
stimuli. Grinspoon, supra note 43, at 20. &quot;The drug did
affect steadiness of the hand and body and the reaction time for
complex stimuli.&quot; Id. The most recent study in this area was
done by Andrew Weil, Norman Zinberg and Judith Nelson of the
Boston University School of Medicine. Their conclusions were that
regular users of marijuana may show some slight degree of
impairment in performance tests, but that the aptitude of the
subjects may even improve slightly after smoking marijuana. Weil
Study 1242. Marijuana-naive subjects tended to show some
impairment in performance. Id. </p>

<p>69 Marihuana depressions I have seen have occurred mainly in
obsessive-compulsive persons who are ambivalent about trying the
drug or who invested the decision to experience marihuana with
great emotional meaning. In interviewing these patients, I have
thought that they used marihuana as an excuse for letting
themselves be depressed, not that their depressions were
psycho-pharmacological. </p>

<p>70 Dr. Weil has stated that &quot;panic reactions occurred
most often among novice users of marijuana-frequently older
persons who are ambivalent about trying the drug in the first
place.&quot; N.Y. Times, May 1, 1970, at 18C, col. 2.<br>
</p>

<p>71 Id. These panic reactions may emulate acute psychoses in
hospital emergency wards &quot;where the patient may feel
overwhelmed, helpless and unable to communicate his
distress.&quot; Weil, supra note 66, at 998. </p>

to marihuana should be considered panic reactions until proven
otherwise,&quot; id. at 998, and that he has never seen a toxic
psychosis following the smoking of marijuana by a normal user.

<p><b>LaGuardia Committee Report on Marihuana</b> </p>

<p><b>Medical Aspects</b> </p>

<h1>SYMPTOMS AND BEHAVIOR</h1>

<p><b>Samuel Allentuck, MD</b> </p>

<hr>

<p><b>IN PRELIMINARY GROUP</b> </p>

<p>The preliminary study of the 5 volunteer subjects had for its
purpose the establishment of methods of procedures to be followed
for the main group, and the obtaining of a general picture of the
physical and mental effects induced by the drug. Having no
knowledge of the safe limits of marihuana dosage, the dosage
given to this group was restricted to from 1 to 4 cc. of the
concentrate, and for smoking from 1 to 3 cigarettes. </p>

<p>When ingested, 1 cc. of marihuana was slightly effective, the
multiples of this more so. There was noted in all subjects some
increase in pulse rate and in blood pressure, dilated and
sluggish pupils, dryness of the mouth and throat, ataxia, and
some clumsiness and incoordination of movement. Symptoms
distinctly disagreeable were dizziness in 3 subjects, a sense of
heaviness of the extremities in 2, nausea in 2 and faintness in
2. Three showed motor restlessness. A state classed as euphoria,
characterized by laughter, witticisms, loquaciousness, and
lowering of inhibitions occurred in 3 subjects. This was not
sustained but alternated with periods during which disagreeable
symptoms were dominant. In one of the subjects (V.C.) there was
no euphoric state, but a feeling of discomfort and depression
throughout. Finally in one of the 5 (A.V.) with 2 cc. There was a
state of depression with anxiety and with 4 cc. a psychotic
episode with fear of death. </p>

<p>With the exception of the one individual during his psychotic
episode, the subjects gave no evidence of abnormal mental content
at any stage of the drug action, the only change noted being a
delay in focusing attention on questions asked and difficulty in
sustaining mental concentration. While there was objection at
times to carrying out repetitious tests, there was no definite
refusal. There was no sexual stimulation giving rise to overt
expression. </p>

<p>With the cigarette smoking, ataxia and charges in the pulse
rate, blood pressure, and pupils corresponded to those following
oral administration. In only one of the subjects, however, was
there definite euphoria. The common symptoms were dizziness and
drowsiness. Two of the subjects found it difficult to
concentrate. </p>

<p>The duration of the effects of marihuana was variable. When it
was ingested, the effects usually passed off in from two to four
hours, but in one instance persisted for seven hours and in
another for fourteen hours. After smoking, the duration of
effects was from one to three hours. </p>

<p><b>IN MAIN GROUP</b> </p>

<p>The evidence of the effects of marihuana was obtained by the
subject's statement of symptoms and sensations, by the nurses'
reports and by the examiner's observations and interpretation of
changes in the subject's mental state and behavior. </p>

<p>The dosage of the marihuana concentrate ranged from 2 to 22
cc. and in each subject the effects of more than one dose were
studied. Dosage ranging from 2 to 5 cc. was used for the largest
number of subjects, and that from 14 to 21 cc. on only seven
occasions. It is known that marihuana intoxication may bring
about a comatose state, but no attempt was made to determine the
dosage required for this. The number receiving each of the
selected doses is shown in Table 2. </p>

<p>(TABLE 2) </p>

<p>While the duration of action and its intensity tended to
increase with dosage, this was not always the case and equal
doses did not bring about uniform effects in all those receiving
them. Thus, 3 cc. produced a striking effect in one individual,
much less in another in still another, 10 cc. produced less
effect than S cc. Such variations are to be explained by
differences in the mental make-up of the subject, and the
particular state of his responsiveness at the time when marihuana
is taken. </p>

<p>The number of cigarettes smoked ranged from one to eleven. The
smoking of a single cigarette took about ten minutes and up to
eight could be smoked in an hour. In smoking, increasing the
number of cigarettes usually increased the sensation described as
&quot;high,&quot; but here also there was no uniformity in
individuals or groups. </p>

<p>When marihuana was ingested, in dosages from 2 cc. up, its
actions became evident in from one half to one hour. The maximum
effects were seen in from two to three hours. These subsided
gradually, but the time of disappearance was variable, usually
three to five hours, in some instances twelve hours or more. </p>

<p>When marihuana cigarettes were used the effects appeared
almost immediately. After one cigarette, these had usually
disappeared in an hour. After several cigarettes had been smoked
the effects increased progressively in intensity and reached a
maximum in about an hour. In most instances they disappeared in
from three or four hours. </p>

<p><b>The Concentrate</b> </p>

<p><u>Behavior Symptoms.</u> </p>

<p>The effects on the general behavior of the subjects taking the
concentrate were variable. If left undisturbed some remained
quietly sitting or lying, showing little interest in their
surroundings. Others were restless and talkative. Under the
heading &quot;Euphoria&quot; there are listed those marihuana
effects which give rise to pleasurable sensations or experiences.
These are a sense of well-being and contentment cheerfulness and
gaiety, talkativeness, bursts of singing and dancing,
daydreaming, a pleasant drowsiness, joking, and performing
amusing antics. The drowsiness, daydreaming and unawareness of
surroundings were present when the subject was left alone. Other
euphoric expressions required an audience and there was much
contagiousness of laughing and joking where several of the
subjects under marihuana were congregated. The occurrence of a
euphoric state, in one or another form, was noted in most of the
subjects. But except for those who were allowed to pass the time
undisturbed, the pleasurable effects were interrupted from time
to time by disagreeable sensations. </p>

<p>Quite commonly seen, as with the preliminary group, was a
difficulty in focusing and sustaining mental concentration. Thus,
there would occur a delay in the subject's answers to questions
and at times some confusion as to their meaning. There was,
however, except in a few isolated instances, no abnormal mental
content evident and the responses brought out by the examiner
were not different from those in the pre-marihuana state. </p>

<p>Altered mental behavior which would give rise to more concern
was seen in a relatively small number of subjects. In some this
took the form of irritation at questioning, refusal to comply
with simple requests and antagonism to certain of the examiners.
There was, however, only verbal and no active opposition in any
of these behaviors, caused by the subject's desire to be left
undisturbed and his disinclination to carry out certain tests
which in his pre-marihuana period he had considered tiresome and
meaningless. With this came antipathy to those conducting the
tests. </p>

<p>The occurrence of the disagreeable physical symptoms
accompanying marihuana action would naturally lead to a feeling
of disquietude and some alarm as to significance and
consequences. </p>

<p>This, however, was a prominent feature in relatively few
instances. A pronounced state of anxiety reaching a panic stage,
associated usually with fear of death or of insanity, was
observed only in those subjects experiencing psychotic episodes
and here the anxiety state led to pleas for escape and not to
acts of aggression. Even in the psychotic states there were no
uncontrollable outbursts of rage or acts of violence. </p>

<p>Some evidence of eroticism was reported in about 10 per cent
of the 150 instances in which marihuana was administered to the
group. The presence of nurses, attendants and other women
associated with the study gave opportunity for frank expression
of sexual stimulation, had this been marked. There was no such
expression even during the psychotic episodes. </p>

<p>In some isolated instances there was evidence of marked
lowering of inhibitions such as loud discharge of flatus,
urinating on the floor instead of in the vessels supplied, and in
one instance frank exhibitionism. In the last instance the
subject, who was not a regular marihuana user, had been arrested
on three occasions for indecent exposure. </p>

<p>The frequency with which significant changes in behavior
occurred is indicated in Table 3 </p>

<p>(TABLE. 3) </p>

<p>As used in Table 3, anxiety means the subject's expressed
worry concerning what might happen to him. Excitement, shown by
physical restlessness, muscular twitchings and jerky movements,
and loud talking, and some degree of antagonism are known to be
expressions of an &quot;alarm&quot; or &quot;fear&quot; state. </p>

<p>It is seen from this table that, except for euphoria, the
effect of marihuana was definitely more pronounced on the
nonusers. This might be taken as evidence of a persisting
tolerance to the drug in the user group, but, on the other hand,
it may have as its basis a feeling of greater apprehension in the
nonusers. Such a feeling would undoubtedly arise among those who
have had no previous experience with marihuana and are in a state
of uncertainty as to its possible harmful effects. </p>

<p><u>Physical Symptoms.</u> </p>

<p>Of the subjective symptoms, a feeling described as lightness,
heaviness, or pressure in the head, often with dizziness, was one
of the earliest and occurred in practically all subjects,
irrespective of dose. Dryness of the mouth and throat were
reported by over half of the subjects as was also a floating
sensation. Unsteadiness in movement and a feeling of heaviness in
the extremities were commonly experienced as was a feeling of
hunger and a desire for sweets especially. Less commonly noted
were nausea, vomiting, sensations of warmth of the head or body,
burning of the eyes and blurring of vision, tightness of the
chest, cardiac palpitation, ringing or pressure in the ears, and
an urge to urinate or defecate. </p>

<p>From observation by the examiner, tremor and ataxia were
present in varying degrees in practically all instances and in
all dosages used, as were also dilatation of the pupils and
sluggish response to light. </p>

<p>These effects were often present on the day following
marihuana administration. </p>

<p>The frequency of the more common subjective symptoms and their
relation to dosage is shown in Table 4. The figures are taken
from the subject's reports. </p>

<p>There is a tendency for the symptoms to be more frequent in
the non-users than in the users but the differences are variable
and in general not striking.</p>

ABUSE AND ADDICTION </b></p>

<p><b>US Government Office of Technology Assessment</b> </p>

<p><b>APPENDIX C: </b></p>

<p><b>PERSPECTIVES ON DEFINING SUBSTANCE ABUSE </b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Four broad arenas that encounter substance abuse-related
issues include, mass communications, criminal justice, medicine,
and public health. These entities often operate independently of
one another and use substantially different terms when describing
the use of illicit substances or the illegal use of licit
substances. </p>

<p>MASS COMMUNICATIONS </p>

<p>The traditional realm of mass communications includes
television, radio, and popular journals and newspapers. Within
these media, the term substance abuse has become a catch-all
phrase, with no clear boundaries. Much of the general public has
become familiar with the term substance abuse within this
ambiguous context. </p>

<p>CRIMINAL JUSTICE </p>

<p>While it is well-known that many crimes are committed by
persons with substance use disorders and that these disorders can
be major contributors to their crimes, there is no systematic
policy within the criminal justice system for the evaluation of
these disorders. In many jurisdictions, whether federal, state,
or local, the prevailing sentiment is that any use of an illicit
substance and/or use of a licit substance in an illegal manner,
is considered criminal abuse. A limited set of quantitative
analyses including blood, urine, and breath tests can be
performed to detect illegal levels of alcohol and/or the presence
of illicit substances. The Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) is
0.10 grams/deciliter for all States excluding Oregon, California,
Utah, Vermont, and Maine, where the level is 0.08
grams/deciliter. As of December 1992, 15 states had lower BAC
levels for youthful offenders charged with driving while
intoxicated. These levels range from 0.00-0.02 grams/deciliter,
which is considered &quot;zero tolerance,&quot; up to 0.04
grams/deciliter (6). The alcohol breath test, while a different
procedure from the BAC, converts the results into BAC units.
Thus, the levels of intoxication for BAC and breath test are
identical. </p>

<p>However, there are limitations to these analyses. In some
jurisdictions, these tests can be performed only with the written
consent of the person. In others, the urine test measures the
presence of only one or two drugs rather than looking for the
entire range of abusable substances. </p>

<p>Besides the limited amount of testing and evaluation, there is
little use of psychological screening examinations or structured
interviews to determine the level and severity of use, abuse, or
dependence. </p>

<p>PUBLIC HEALTH </p>

<p>The traditional public health model incorporates the host-
agent-environment relationship. Each of these factors has an
individual, as well as an interrelated role in the potential use
and/or harmful use of a substance. </p>

<p>Host factors may include possible genetic, psychological, and
biological susceptibility. Agent factors incorporate the
substance's abuse liability capacity, as well as how the
substance is marketed. Lastly, environmental factors encompass
not only the availability of the substance, but the social,
cultural, political, and economic climate as well (3,4). </p>

<p>Over the past 20 years, professionals within the field of
public health have attempted to deemphasize the strict medical
concept of substance abuse. Attention had previously focused
almost exclusively on individual drug use patterns, rather than
featuring the diverse problems of drug, alcohol, and tobacco use
as being intimately tied into communities and society as a whole.
</p>

<p>Even the term &quot;substance abuse&quot; has come under
scrutiny. While the word &quot;substance&quot; may at first
appear quite generic, in many fields, this term has come to
incorrectly infer illicit drug use--reinforcing the misperception
of many individuals that alcohol and tobacco are not drugs.
&quot;Abuse&quot; generally denotes the more severe forms of
addiction. In reality, there is a continuum that begins with
initial drug use and may progress to harmful use and addiction,
with various problems present along the spectrum. In lieu of the
term &quot;abuse,&quot; public health professionals prefer terms
such as &quot;alcohol and drug problems&quot; or the
&quot;harmful/hazardous use&quot; of a drug. </p>

<p>The focus of the public health perspective is to understand
the importance social norms, environment, and availability play
in the shaping of alcohol- and drug-related problems both on an
individual and societal level. </p>

<p>MEDICAL </p>

<p>Within the fields of medicine, the two most frequently cited
texts for the definitions of substance abuse and dependence are
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)
issued by the American Psychiatric Association and the
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) published by the
World Health Organization (WHO). Each successive version of the
DSM and ICD has been given a number signifying its order in the
overall sequence of manuals; DSM uses Roman numerals and ICD uses
ordinary numbers. The newest version of ICD, ICD-10, was
published in 1992. The current version of DSM is the Third
Edition- Revised (DSM-III-R), which will shortly be superseded by
DSM-IV. </p>

<p>ICD </p>

<p>While the current ICD and DSM definitions of substance
dependence are nearly identical, the two manuals differ sharply
on the concepts of abuse, which ICD classifies as harmful use. </p>

<p>The ICD manual is intended to be used on an international
basis, and the socially defined &quot;American&quot; criteria
present in the DSM manual for substance abuse cannot be
adequately transferred to a wide range of cultures. The current
ICD-10 category of harmful use, while applicable
cross-culturally, is limited to: &quot;A pattern of psychoactive
substance use that is causing damage to health. The damage may be
physical (as in cases of hepatitis from the self-administration
of injected drugs) or mental ( e.g.,episodes of depressive
disorder secondary to heavy consumption of alcohol).&quot; </p>

<p>DSM </p>

<p>In the early 1950s the first DSM manual grouped alcohol and
drug use disorders under the broad category of &quot;Sociopathic
Personality Disturbances.&quot; At that time, a substance use
disorder was considered a moral weakness or the manifestation of
a &quot;deeper&quot; psychological problem, rather than a
disorder in-and-of itself with social, psychological, and perhaps
even genetic determinants. </p>

<p>Throughout the 1970s and 1980s clinical research identified
the need for separate categories for substance use disorders. The
DSM-III manual, in 1980, was the first manual in this series to
clearly identify substance abuse and dependence as pathological
conditions different from substance use alone. DSM-III also
alluded to the fact that social and cultural factors are
contributors to the onset and continuation of abuse and
dependence. The DSM-III definition of dependence emphasized
tolerance (needing to take much higher doses of the substance to
obtain the same effect) and withdrawal (having a distinct pattern
of physiological arousal upon abrupt discontinuation or reduction
in dosage), and required the presence of one or both of these
phenomena to make a dependence diagnosis. Substance abuse was
defined as problematic use with social or occupational
impairment, but with the absence of significant tolerance and/or
withdrawal. In both disorders, impairment in social and
occupational function was a prominent aspect of the definitions,
creating a significant overlap between the criteria for substance
abuse and dependence. In 1987, DSM-III was revised (DSM-III-R) to
give the behavioral aspects of substance use disorders equal
weight to the physiological components. </p>

<p>This shift away from the physiological to the behavioral
elements of dependence was strongly influenced by the work of
researchers Edwards and Gross, who had extensively studied
persons with alcohol problems. These researchers conceptualized
alcohol dependence as a syndrome of graded severity that involved
an interconnected complex of behavioral, psychological, and
physiological elements associated with loss of control over
alcohol consumption. </p>

<p>Contributing to the emphasis on behavioral aspects of
dependence was work by Brady, Thompson, and others who had shown
that animals can be taught to self-administer substances of
abuse. Once taught, it was observed that most animals will expend
tremendous amounts of energy to obtain additional doses and that
this &quot;drug-seeking behavior&quot; is very difficult to
extinguish. Efforts to repeat drug self- administration were
especially prominent if the experimental drug was one with a high
abuse liability such as morphine, methamphetamine, or
(especially) cocaine and was difficult to extinguish. </p>

<p>This body of work was among the first in a line of
investigation studying the behavioral aspects of drugs. This
field of research became known as &quot;behavioral
pharmacology&quot; and was strengthened by additional studies by
Olds and others. </p>

<p>Thus, both the work of Edwards and Gross, that of behavioral
pharmacologists, and of basic scientists pointed toward the
presence of a definable and independent syndrome that can result
after an organism has learned to self-administer abusable
substances. This syndrome was not dependent on the ability of the
drug to produce tolerance and withdrawal, but rather on its
positive reinforcing effects. These effects were evident by
observing the behavior of the organism, and could be measured by
quantifying the work that the organism would produce to obtain
the substance. </p>

<p>The development of the substance use disorders section for
DSM-IV began in 1988 and involved the most extensive process yet
undertaken for such a task. The major change in DSM-IV is in the
definition of substance abuse. Unlike DSM-III and DSM-III-R, DSM
-IV clearly separates the criteria for dependence from those of
abuse. Dependence in DSM-IV is a syndrome involving compulsive
use, with or without tolerance and withdrawal; abuse is
problematic use without compulsive use, significant tolerance, or
withdrawal. Preliminary data from the DSM-IV field trials
indicate that this change will probably increase the number of
persons diagnosed as having substance abuse, especially for those
using hallucinogens, inhalants, sedatives, and amphetamines. </p>

<p>Substance Use and the Transition to Abuse/Harmful Use or
Dependence </p>

<p>One problem in developing criteria for this second,
nondependent category, whether called abuse or harmful use, is
that though dependence has been well-studied, the progression
from use to abuse has not been adequately researched (except in
the case of alcohol); and depending on the perspective, may not
always be linear. For example, using the DSM-IV classifications,
it is possible that substances such as opiates may follow a path
that begins with use and progresses to dependence before
abuse-related problems are identified. Within the field of
alcohol research, the consensus of studies is that consuming
three to four standard-sized drinks/day by males (equal to 40 or
more grams of alcohol at 12 grams/drink) is associated with an
increased probability for the development of problems. As females
tend to absorb alcohol more quickly, studies have shown that
problems typically begin at about two to three drinks/day
(1,2,5). </p>

<p>Little work has been done on other substances. All persons who
end up with abuse, harmful use, or dependence begin with use. Use
of a substance, whether licit or illicit, does not constitute a
substance use disorder even though it may be unwise and strongly
disapproved of by family, friends, employers, religious groups,
or society at large. Use by itself is not considered a medical
disorder. For a disorder to be present, use must become something
else such as: occur more frequently; occur at higher doses; or
result in a magnitude of problems. Though there have been some
conceptual models developed for how one might approach a better
understanding of this transition, there are few data available to
clearly point out where the border lies. </p>

<p>DSM-IV AND ICD-10 DEFINITIONS </p>

<p>DSM-IV Diagnostic Criteria: </p>

<p>Abuse </p>

<p>A. A maladaptive pattern of substance use leading to
clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by
one or more of the following occurring over the same 12- month
period: </p>

<p>1. Recurrent substance use resulting in a failure to fulfill
major role obligations at work, school, or home (e.g., repeated
absences or poor work performance related to substance use;
substance-related absences, suspensions, or expulsions from
school; neglect of children or household). </p>

<p>2. Recurrent substance use in situations in which it is
physically hazardous (e.g.,driving an automobile or operating a
machine when impaired by substance use). </p>

<p>3. Recurrent substance-related legal problems (e.g.,arrests
for substance-related disorderly conduct). </p>

<p>4. Continued substance use despite having persistent or
recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated
by the effects of the substance (e.g.,arguments with spouse about
consequences of intoxication, physical fights). </p>

<p>B. Has never met the criteria for Substance Dependence for
this substance. </p>

<p>Dependence: </p>

<p>A maladaptive pattern of substance use, leading to clinically
significant impairment or distress, as manifested by three or
more of the following occurring in the same 12- month period: </p>

<p>1. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: </p>

<p>a. need for markedly increased amounts of the substance to
achieve intoxication or desired effect </p>

<p>b. markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same
amount of the substance </p>

<p>2. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: </p>

<p>a. the characteristic withdrawal syndrome for the substance </p>

<p>b. the same (or closely related) substance is taken to relieve
or avoid withdrawal symptoms </p>

<p>3. The substance is often taken in larger amounts or over a
longer period than was intended </p>

<p>4. Any unsuccessful effort or a persistent desire to cut down
or control substance use </p>

<p>5. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to
obtain the substance (e.g., visiting multiple doctors or driving
long distances), use of the substance (e.g., chain- smoking), or
recover from its effects </p>

<p>6. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities
given up or reduced because of substance use </p>

<p>7. Continued substance use despite knowledge of having had a
persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is
likely to be caused or exacerbated by the substance (e.g.,
current cocaine use despite recognition of cocaine- induced
depression, or continued drinking despite recognition that an
ulcer was made worse by alcohol consumption) </p>

<p>Specify if: </p>

<p>o with physiological dependence: Evidence of tolerance or
withdrawal (i.e., either items (1) or (2) are present). </p>

<p>o without physiological dependence: No evidence of tolerance
or withdrawal i.e., neither items (1) nor (2) are present). </p>

<p>ICD-10 Diagnostic Criteria for Clinical Use: </p>

<p>Harmful Use: </p>

<p>A pattern of psychoactive substance use that is causing damage
to health. The damage may be physical (as in cases of hepatitis
from the self-administration of injected drugs) or mental
(e.g.,episodes of depressive disorder secondary to heavy
consumption of alcohol). </p>

<p>The diagnosis requires that actual damage should have been
caused to the mental or physical health of the user. Harmful
patterns of use are often criticized by others and frequently
associated with adverse social consequences of various kinds. The
fact that a pattern of use or particular substance is disapproved
of by another person or by the culture, or may have led to
socially negative consequences such as arrest or marital
arguments is not in itself evidence of harmful use. </p>

<p>Acute intoxication or &quot;hangover&quot; is not in itself
sufficient evidence of the damage to health required for coding
harmful use. Harmful use should not be diagnosed if dependence
syndrome, a psychotic disorder, or another specific form of drug-
or alcohol-related disorder is present. </p>

<p>Dependence Syndrome </p>

<p>A definite diagnosis of dependence should usually be made only
if three or more of the following have been experienced or
exhibited at some time during the previous year: </p>

<p>1. A strong desire or sense of compulsion to take the
substance. </p>

<p>2. Difficulties in controlling substance-taking behavior in
terms of its onset, termination, or levels of use </p>

<p>3. A physiological withdrawal state when substance use has
ceased or been reduced, as evidenced by: the characteristic
withdrawal syndrome for the substance; or use of the same (or
closely related) substance with the intention of relieving or
avoiding withdrawal symptoms. </p>

<p>4. Evidence of tolerance such that increased doses of the
psychoactive substance are required in order to achieve effects
originally produced by lower doses (clear examples of this are
found in alcohol- and opiate-dependent individuals who may take
daily doses sufficient to incapacitate or kill nontolerant
users). </p>

<p>5. Progressive neglect of alternative pleasures or interests
because of psychoactive substance use, increased amounts of time
necessary to obtain or take the substance or recover from its
effects. </p>

<p>6. Persisting with substance use despite clear evidence of
overtly harmful consequences, such as harm to the liver through
excessive drinking, depressive mood states consequent to periods
of heavy substance use, or drug- related impairment of cognitive
functioning; efforts should be made to determine that the user
was actually, or could be expected to be, aware of the nature and
extent of harm. </p>

<p>Narrowing of the personal repertoire of patterns of
psychoactive substance use has also been described as a
characteristic feature (e.g., a tendency to drink alcoholicdrinks
in the same way on weekdays and weekends, regardless of social
constraints that determine appropriate drinking behavior). </p>

<p>It is an essential characteristic of the dependence syndrome
that either psychoactive substance taking or a desire to take a
particular substance should be present; the subjective awareness
of compulsion to use drugs is most commonly seen during attempts
to stop or control substance use. This diagnostic requirement
would exclude, for instance, surgical patients given opioid drugs
for the relief of pain, who may show signs of an opioid
withdrawal state when drugs are not given but who have no desire
to continue taking drugs. </p>

<p>The dependence syndrome may be present for a specific
substance (e.g., tobacco or diazepam), for a class of substances
(e.g., opioid drugs), or for a wider ranger of different
substances (as for those individuals who feel a sense of
compulsion regularly to use whatever drugs are available and who
show distress, agitation, and/or physical signs of a withdrawal
state upon abstinence). </p>

<p>The diagnosis of the dependence syndrome may be further
specified by the following (the following roughly correspond to
the course modifiers and relapse section of DSM-IV): </p>

<p>o Currently abstinent. </p>

<p>o Currently abstinent, but in a protected environment (e.g.,
in hospital, in a therapeutic community, in prison, etc.). </p>

<p>o Currently on a clinically supervised maintenance or
replacement regime (controlled dependence, e.g., with methadone;
nicotine gum or nicotine patch). </p>

<p>o Currently abstinent, but receiving treatment with aversive
or blocking drugs (e.g., naltrexone or disulfiram). </p>

<p>o Currently using the substance (active dependence). </p>

<p>o Continuous use. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Episodic use. _ </li>
</ul>

<p> <b>APPENDIX A: DRUG CONTROL POLICY IN THE UNITED STATES:
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES </b> </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"><br>
</p>

<p> The United States has always been a drug-using country. In
colonial days, people drank more alcohol than they do today, with
estimates ranging from three to as many as seven times more
alcohol per year (13) While public drunkenness was a criminal
offense, it was generally considered a personal indiscretion.
(1). The temperance movement began in earnest after the
Revolution, when heavy drinking was revealed to be a problem, and
religious figures became committed to temperance. (1). Since
then, the American experience with both licit and illicit drugs
can be viewed as a series of reactions to the public's shifting
tolerance toward their use (9). </p>

<p> THE EARLY 1900s: NARCOTICS AND COCAINE </p>

<p> In the late 19th century it was possible to buy, in a store
or through mail order, many pseudomedical preparations,
containing morphine, cocaine, and even heroin (9). The ubiquitous
soft drink Coca-Cola used to contain cocaine until 1903, when it
was replaced with caffeine (9). Pharmacies sold cocaine in pure
form, as well as a number of opium-derived drugs, such as
morphine and heroin, the latter of which became well-known when
it was marketed by the Bayer Co. beginning in 1898 (10).
Physician prescriptions of these drugs increased from 1 percent
of all prescriptions in 1874 to between 20 to 25 percent in 1902;
they were not only available but they were widely used, without
major concerns about negative health consequences (14). </p>

<p> Cocaine and narcotic preparations were taken off the market
for various reasons. Increasing awareness of the hazards of drug
use and adulterated food led to such regulations as the Pure Food
and Drug Act of 1906 that required that fraudulent claims be
removed from patent medicines, as well as disclosure of
habit-forming substances. The passage of several antinarcotic and
pharmaceutical labeling laws was spurred on by these health
concerns, a growing temperance movement, the development of safe
pain relievers (such as aspirin), a broader range of medical
treatments, and the growing immigrant population thought to be
associated with specific drug-using practices. However, these
laws did not make patent remedies, cocaine, and opium illegal.
Some individual states imposed tighter restrictions on their
availability, but there was no uniformity among state laws. It
was United States involvement with international narcotics
concern that led there (9,10,14). </p>

<p> In 1909, the International Opium Commission called by the
United States, met in Shanghai, to begin an international
discussion concerning the problems of narcotics and the narcotics
trade. Twelve nations, in addition to the United States, were
present to discuss problems relating to opium. At that time the
perception in the United States was that Chinese immigrants were
to blame for the opium smoking problems. This angered the
Chinese, who had instituted strict campaigns against the sale and
use of opium within their own country. The Chinese were seeking
U.S. assurances for help in ending Western opium trafficking into
China. The State Department not only wanted to support China's
drug control efforts, but thought that international drug control
measures would help stanch the flow of drugs into the United
States, and thus the nonmedical consumption of these drugs. It
would not be until two years later, in the Hague, that a treaty
would be signed stating that all the signatories would enact
domestic legislation controlling narcotics trade, specifically
limiting the use of narcotics for medicinal purposes (9,10). </p>

<p> Hamilton Wright, the State Department's opium commissioner,
attempted to draft legislation but met opposition from the
States, the medical profession, pharmacists and pharmaceutical
companies. After nearly three years of debate, Congress passed
the Harrison Act in December 1914 (named for Representative
Francis Burton Harrison, who introduced the initial form of the
bill for the Administration). The bill provided for strict
control of opium and coca and their derivatives: both their entry
into the country and their dispersion to patients. Maintenance of
addicts by physicians was allowed until 1919. Opposition to the
Harrison Act came mainly from pharmaceutical companies and
pharmacists, who objected to what they called the Act's confusing
and complex record keeping requirements (9). </p>

<p> Passage of the Harrison Act reflected, in part, growing
public sentiment that opium and cocaine were medicines to be
taken only in times of illness (and then only when prescribed by
a physician) and that these substances could cause insanity and
crime, particularly in foreigners and minorities. Smoking opium
was associated with Chinese immigrants; popular belief also held
that cocaine would affect blacks more forcefully than whites and
incite them to violence. Marijuana was believed to have been
brought into the country and promoted by Mexican immigrants and
then picked up by black jazz musicians. These beliefs played a
part in the 1937 Marijuana Tax Act, which attempted to control
the drug's use (9). As early as 1910, many people argued against
any nonmedical use of narcotics. </p>

<p> PROHIBITION AND BEYOND </p>

<p> Focus on Alcohol </p>

<p> Ratification in 1919 of the 18th amendment prohibited the
manufacture, sale, transportation, importation, and exportation
of alcohol and shifted the Nation's focus for more than a decade
from the dangers of narcotics to the Nation's alcohol problems.
Prohibition had its roots in the Temperance Movement, which began
shortly after the Revolution. In 1784, Benjamin Rush, a physician
and signer of the Declaration of Independence, published a
pamphlet entitled, &quot;An Inquiry Into the Effects of Ardent
Spirits on the Mind and Body,&quot; which was widely disseminated
among Temperance leaders. In it he described a &quot;disease
model&quot; of excessive drinking, which characterized
drunkenness and alcohol addiction as a &quot;disease of the
will,&quot; in addition to causing many physical diseases. By the
mid-19th century, the American middle class had become more aware
of the dangers of alcohol to the family, the nation, and the
factory (1). By the late 19th century and early 20th century, the
Temperance Movement came to be associated almost exclusively with
American Protestantism as a political mechanism to control the
growing numbers of non-Protestant immigrants. This political and
social strength helped, in 1919, to ratify the 18th amendment
which forbade the sale of alcoholic beverages, and to implement
it by means of the Volstead Act in 1920 (1). </p>

<p> The shifting tolerance of Americans toward substance use is
evidenced by the successes and failures of the Prohibition era.
In 1919, many were optimistic that the prohibition of alcohol
would solve many of the country's social problems. If alcohol
contributed to the crime and unemployment associated with the
cities, then removing it from the market might help solve those
problems. However, despite evidence that consumption declined
(based on declining rates of death due to cirrhosis and of
alcoholic psychosis in State mental hospitals), there is also
evidence that widespread dishonesty existed in the enforcement of
dry laws. Jobs to enforce Prohibition were doled out as political
favors, which may have contributed to graft, corruption, and the
surge in underworld crime (9,17). In addition to the perceived
rise in corruption, the passage of progressively stricter laws
regarding violations of the Volstead Act also contributed to
waning public support of prohibition (17). The 1933 repeal of
Prohibition signaled that public sentiment had once again become
favorable toward alcohol, and alcohol and its related problems
returned to private, rather than public, arenas. </p>

<p> The scientific literature of the 1930s and early 1940s
concentrated mainly on captive alcoholic populations in jails,
mental hospitals, and skid row, allowing many Americans to
distance themselves from alcoholism (1). During this same period,
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) was founded, but lacked mainstream
recognition until the 1950s and 1960s when the scientists lent
support to the disease model of alcoholism, which has always been
the central tenet of AA (1,11). </p>

<p> Focus on Narcotics </p>

<p> While alcohol experienced a transition period in respect to
public tolerance, negative attitudes toward narcotics and other
drugs remained constant, or became even more severe. During the
1920s, the Federal government expanded its antidrug efforts
through new Treasury Department regulations (8). In 1930,
President Hoover created the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and
appointed Harry Anslinger as the Commissioner of Narcotics, a
position Anslinger held from 1930 to 1962, a precursor, perhaps,
to the modern day drug czar. For more than three decades,
Anslinger oversaw all aspects of drug control, from interdiction
to domestic supply, to public relations. He effectively used
religious and other antidrug groups to maintain a high antidrug
sentiment in the country. He also controlled the flow of legal
drug supplies, by keeping watch over doctors who might prescribe
unusually large amounts of narcotics. Anslinger was opposed to
the medical treatment of addiction, and addicts, like alcoholics,
were seen as deviants (9,15). </p>

<p> Prior to the mid-1960s, marijuana use in the United States
was mostly confined to various subgroups such as Mexican
laborers, jazz musicians, and beatniks. Although portrayed as a
killer weed and a menace by antimarijuana reformers, there is
little evidence that it was either at this time. In 1937, the
Marihuana Tax Act (the Federal government then spelled marijuana
with an &quot;h&quot;), became law, making the use and sale of
marijuana without a tax stamp Federal offenses. Some companies
were permitted to apply for a license to use cannabis products
(e.g., for birdseed, paint and rope), and doctors could still
prescribe marijuana in limited circumstances. However, starting
in 1937, recreational use was punished with greater severity
(15). Some speculated that the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act
resulted from strong anti-Mexican sentiment in the Southwest and
the political power of Anslinger (5). </p>

<p> Intolerance toward drug use was very strong in the 1930s and
40s. Federal laws concerning the sale and use of drugs got
progressively stricter, culminating in the introduction of the
death penalty for the sale of heroin to anyone under 18 years old
by anyone older than 18 (10). Illicit drug use during these
decades was low in the mainstream population. This
marginalization of narcotics (or at least, of the people who used
them) may have played a part in the resurfacing of these drugs
after the 1930s. There was a concern during World War II that
American soldiers in Asia would succumb to drug supplies
available in those countries and return home with drug habits.
The Bureau of Narcotics received no budget increases, since
Congress apparently believed it was well equipped to deal with
the current drug levels (9). </p>

<p> In the 1950s, however, heroin was brought into the country in
larger quantities than at any time since it was outlawed. Dealers
learned that poor quality heroin could be sold at inflated
prices, and this higher cost pushed users into criminal
lifestyles heretofore not seen on such a wide scale (12). A
nationwide scare that drug use would spread from the urban poor
(mostly minorities) to the rest of the country erupted. The fact
that young people appeared to be the biggest users of heroin was
particularly alarming. This fear was reflected in the passage of
the Narcotic Control Act of 1956, which increased penalties for
the sale and possession of marijuana and heroin (15). </p>

<p> The reaction to this rise in drug use was not entirely
fearful, however. Scientific and technological advances offered
alternative answers to coping with the drug problem a switch from
the past tactics of law enforcement. Even though the
stereotypical heroin user was still a poor minority, new ideas
for treating and helping these people emerged as part of
increasing acceptance of the medical model of addiction. In the
1960s, methadone maintenance pilot programs were launched. By
using the long-acting opioid methadone for treatment of addiction
to the short- acting opiate heroin, these programs offer a way
for heroin addicts to control their addiction (6). </p>

<p> 1960s-PRESENT </p>

<p> In the 1960s, white middle-class youths, who were more
visible than their minority counterparts, began experimenting
with drugs, including marijuana and heroin, causing wide public
concern and demand for more treatment approaches and additional
law enforcement (17). Some of this new interest in drug use may
be attributed to the intolerance toward it in the preceding
decades. Marijuana had never been widely used, and after the
1930s its use was not a widespread concern. It was rediscovered
by young people in the 1960s, who had grown up with parents who
used alcohol. Some of the drug consumption may also be linked to
an increase in consumption generally during the late 1960s and
early 1970s, the Vietnam War protest movement, and the rapid
changes in American society that occurred in those years
(9,10,17). </p>

<p> Despite the image of the sixties as a time of widespread
experimentation, the increase of drug use activated many who had
been quiet on the issue. Marijuana, the drug of choice among many
young people, was seen by some researchers as the gateway to more
dangerous drug use. Richard Nixon was elected President in 1968
on a law and order platform, and it is said that no other
President has campaigned as hard against drug abuse (9). As
during World War II, concern rose that soldiers serving in
Southeast Asia would develop drug habits while there. In this
case, the fears were well- founded, as many servicemen did avail
themselves of cheap supplies of heroin and marijuana. However,
even among those who became addicted, many stopped their drug use
upon returning to the United States. During the 1960s, the old
linkages between corruption, Asians, and opium surfaced once
again in public opinion, leading to more stringent measures to
stop the flow of drugs into the United States from both Asia and
Latin America (8). </p>

<p> Public support of law enforcement against drugs was high
during the late 1960s and early 1970s, and President Nixon spoke
of mounting &quot;a frontal assault on our number one public
enemy [drugs],&quot; but long mandatory minimum sentences for
possession of small amounts of marijuana disturbed many
Americans, even those who did not approve of marijuana use. The
Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970
lessened penalties for possession of marijuana. It also
established a system for classifying drugs into five schedules,
which is still used today. Drugs are placed in each schedule
based on their potential for abuse, their known harmfulness, and
medical value. Marijuana and heroin are listed in schedule
1--drugs with high potential for addiction and no recognized
medical value. There have been, however, limited experimental
programs approved by the DEA and FDA for the use of marijuana in
treatment of nausea due to chemotherapy and of ocular pressure
due to glaucoma. Cocaine is listed in schedule 2--drugs with
potential for addiction for acceptable for some medical
applications. Subsequent to the establishment of this system,
drug policies and laws for individual drugs have been based on
the drug's schedule (3,16). </p>

<p> In 1972, the President's National Commission on Marijuana and
Drug Abuse recommended that the laws against the use of marijuana
be relaxed, since the enforcement of these laws was becoming too
burdensome to police in some areas, and was considered intrusive
on individual privacy in others. The drug was increasingly
thought to be innocuous in its effects, both by scientists and
others (4). Several States passed decriminalization laws, which
allowed possession or use of small amounts of marijuana and
imposed fines instead of prison sentences for transgressions of
minor possession laws (10). The Commission remained strict on
cocaine, which was also seeing a surge in use, but few experts
thought it was physically addictive or should be classified in
the same category as other narcotics. </p>

<p> Despite President Nixon's emphasis on &quot;law and
order&quot; responses to drug use, his drug budget favored
prevention, education, and treatment. The National Institute on
Drug Abuse (NIDA) was created as the lead agency for demand
reduction, directing Federal prevention and treatment services
and research. The Drug Enforcement Administration was created as
the lead agency for supply reduction, and single state agencies
were created to guide Federal funds into state and local antidrug
programs (3). </p>

<p> From the mid-sixties to the late seventies, the composition
of drug users changed substantially. While drug use was still
associated primarily with minorities and the lower classes, drug
use by middle-class whites became a widespread and more accepted
phenomenon. As in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries, when middle class whites haphazardly used narcotic
preparations, this new group of drug users down-played or ignored
the dangerous effects of drugs, and extolled their virtues as
agents of nonconformity and mind-expansion. Cocaine was an
expensive and high-status drug, used mainly for recreation by
upper- and middle-class whites. </p>

<p> From the drug experiences of this cohort, which were by no
means entirely positive, the public of the late seventies was
better educated about the effects of drugs, and public
disapproval of drug use began once again to increase. Drug use,
however, particularly of cocaine and marijuana remained high. The
Ford Administration (1974-1977) focused on the drugs it thought
posed the greatest danger--heroin, amphetamines, and
barbiturates. Some even thought that drugs such as cocaine and
marijuana should be legalized, &quot;so as to end the enormous
government expenditures of money and time on a problem that only
seemed to bring profits to drug dealers and elicit contempt for
the law from an ever-growing body of drug users&quot; (9). </p>

<p> During the Carter Administration (1977- 1981), Peter Bourne,
a special assistant for health issues, argued for Federal
decriminalization of possession of small amounts of marijuana,
while focusing interdiction efforts on heroin. But Bourne
resigned over a scandal involving criticisms over his prescribing
practices. His resignation forced President Carter to take a
harder position on drugs, and Federal decriminalization never
occurred. There were still States in which marijuana was
decriminalized, but these decreased in numbers through 1990, when
the last State--Alaska--to have decriminalization repealed those
laws. </p>

<p> The departure of Bourne coincided with the emergence of
several parents' groups concerned about drug use by their preteen
children. One group in particular, in Atlanta, Georgia, became
enraged when they found that in addition to drug use at parties,
their children were able to buy drug paraphernalia and prodrug
literature in local stores. The group formed the Parent Resources
Institute on Drug Education, National Families in Action, and the
National Federation of Parents. These groups were instrumental in
prodding NIDA to publicize more widely the dangers of marijuana
and other drugs once thought of as harmless. </p>

<p> The Administration of Ronald Reagan (1981-1989) favored a
strict approach to drug use and increased law enforcement. First
Lady Nancy Reagan actively campaigned against drug use, urging
school children to &quot;Just Say No.&quot; At the same time,
funding for research and treatment decreased, while the
availability of cocaine, heroin, and marijuana remained the same
(9). The budget for antidrug related activities rose from $1.5
billion in 1981 (split nearly equally between supply reduction
(domestic law enforcement and international/border law
enforcement) and demand reduction (research, prevention and
treatment) to $4.2 billion by the end of President Reagan's
second term. Two-thirds of the funds were now allocated for law
enforcement activities, with the remaining third allocated for
demand reduction (2). In 1984, the Crime Control Act increased
dramatically Federal mandatory minimum sentencing provisions for
drug- related crime, including the manufacture, distribution, or
possession of controlled substances. It also expanded the
criminal and civil asset forfeiture laws to penalize drug
traffickers and increased Federal criminal penalties for
drug-related offenses (3). This trend continued through the
remainder of the Reagan administration as well as that of
President Bush. </p>

<p> The 1980s saw significant shifts in patterns of cocaine use.
The negative effects of cocaine use, especially long-termuse, had
previously been masked, but middle-class users with drug-related
problems suddenly were more common. Concurrently, cocaine
smuggling escalated, resulting in increased availability, lower
prices, and higher quality. Low-income, minority communities
began experiencing major drug problems, first with powdered
cocaine, then in the mid- eighties especially with the new form
of cocaine--crack. Commonly called an epidemic, the spread of
this smokable cocaine inspired both President Reagan and antidrug
groups to heightened drug intervention efforts. Crack appeared to
be highly addictive, as well as affordable, and fear of its
consequences forced many lawmakers into action. The Anti- Drug
Abuse Act of 1986 authorized more funds than ever before for the
war on drugs, most of which was designated for international
interdiction activities (9), and the establishment of the Office
of Substance Abuse Prevention (OSAP). The AIDS epidemic has also
affected patterns of drug use, since some intravenous (IV) drug
users may have switched to smoking crack in order to avoid
exposure to the AIDS virus. Other IV drug users, however, have
continued to inject, and comprise a large percentage of the
AIDS-infected population. </p>

<p> While the main focus of drug control policy in the 1980s was
interdiction of illicit drugs, significant policy initiatives
concerning alcohol were also implemented. For example, the goal
of the national minimum drinking age of 21 was stated in 1984 and
achieved by 1988. Warning labels were required on all retail
containers of alcoholic beverages beginning in 1989 (7). </p>

<p> When George Bush was elected President in 1988 the climate
within the country was highly intolerant to the use of illicit
drugs. President Bush echoed President Nixon when he declared
that the drug epidemic was &quot;public enemy number one&quot;
(16). The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 mandated the creation of
the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), to be headed
by a director, sometimes called the drug czar, who would
coordinate U.S. drug control and abuse policy, resources, and
operations (Public Law 100-690). The first director was William
Bennett, former Secretary for Education under President Reagan.
He was followed by Robert Martinez, former Governor of Florida.
The director, in conjunction with the President and Cabinet
Secretaries, sets Administration policy on drug control. However,
ONCDP lacks budgetary authority, and under President Bush the
director of ONDCP was not a Cabinet position. During the Bush
Administration, additional funds were authorized for the war on
drugs, including increased funds for treatment and prevention.
However, most of the funds were designated for law enforcement
activities. Spending for antidrug-related activities rose from
the high of $4.2 billion under President Reagan, to a proposed
$12.7 billion in the last year of President Bush's term. Again,
the monetary split was roughly two-thirds for law enforcement and
international interdiction activities and one-third for demand
reduction (2). </p>

<p> While &quot;The War on Drugs&quot; has remained part of the
political lexicon, President Clinton, after taking office in
1993, cut the Office of National Drug Control Policy from 146
positions to 25. He elevated the director of ONDCP to cabinet
status, and Lee P. Brown, former Police Commissioner of New York
City was appointed to this position. During his campaign for the
presidency, Clinton advocated drug treatment on demand, and the
addition of 100,000 new police officers to the streets. _ <br>

<h1>The LaGuardia Report - Sociological Study </h1>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>

<hr>

<p>From the foregoing study the following conclusions are drawn: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Marihuana is used extensively in the Borough of Manhattan
        but the problem is not as acute as it is reported to be
        in other sections of the United States. </li>
    <li>The introduction of marihuana into this area is recent as
        compared to other localities. </li>
    <li>The cost of marihuana is low and therefore within the
        purchasing power of most persons. </li>
    <li>The distribution and use of marihuana is centered in
        Harlem. </li>
    <li>The majority of marihuana smokers are Negroes and
        Latin-Americans. </li>
    <li>The consensus among marihuana smokers is that the use of
        the drug creates a definite feeling of adequacy. </li>
    <li>The practice of smoking marihuana does not lead to
        addiction in the medical sense of the word. </li>
    <li>The sale and distribution of marihuana is not under the
        control of any single organized group. </li>
    <li>The use of marihuana does not lead to morphine or heroin
        or cocaine addiction and no effort is made to create a
        market for these narcotics by stimulating the practice of
        marihuana smoking. </li>
    <li>Marihuana is not the determining factor in the commission
        of major crimes. </li>
    <li>Marihuana smoking is not widespread among school
        children. </li>
    <li>Juvenile delinquency is not associated with the practice
        of smoking marihuana. </li>
    <li>The publicity concerning the catastrophic effects of
        marihuana smoking in New York City is unfounded. </li>
</ol>

<p><b>The LaGuardia Committee Report on Marihuana</b> </p>

<p><b>(Look for the Jack Benny Jello Hour)</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><u>The Cigarette</u></b> </p>

<p>Smoking. When marihuana is smoked, there is, as has been
stated, no such accuracy in dosage as is the case when it is
ingested. The marihuana user acquires a technique or art in
smoking &quot;reefers.&quot; This involves special preparation of
the cigarette and regulation of the frequency and depth of
inhalations. In a group of smokers, a cigarette circulates from
one to another, each in turn taking one or more puffs. The
performance is a slow and deliberate one and the cigarette, held
in a forked match stick, is smoked to its end. </p>

<p>When the smoke comes in contact with the respiratory mucous
membrane, the absorption of the active principle is rapid and the
effects are recognized promptly by the subject. He soon learns to
distinguish the amount of smoking which will give pleasant
effects from the amount which will give unpleasant ones and so
regulates his dosages. Providing there are no disturbing factors,
as is the case in gatherings of small friendly groups or parties
in &quot;tea-pads,&quot; the regulated smoking produces a
euphoric state, which accounts for continued indulgence.<br>
</p>

<p>(TABLE 4)<br>
</p>

<p>The effect from smoking marihuana cigarettes was studied in 32
subjects. Of these, 20 were classed as users, that is, prior to
their arrest they had had more or less extensive experience in
smoking. In the study the smoking was repeated by each subject
several times, the number of cigarettes smoked within an hour
ranging from one to eight. </p>

<p>In all of the user group the smoking produced a euphoric state
with its feeling of well- being, contentment, sociability, mental
and physical relaxation, which usually ended in a feeling of
drowsiness. Talkativeness and laughing and the sensation of
floating in the air were common occurrences. These effects were
of short duration, from one to three or four hours after the
smoking was concluded. In none of these subjects was there an
expression of antagonism or antisocial behavior. </p>

<p>In the non-user group the effects were similar except that in
one subject a state of mental confusion occurred and in another
the main effect was a feeling of dizziness, unsteadiness, and
muscular weakness. Finally one subject showed effects entirely
different from the others. He smoked one cigarette and became
restless, agitated, dizzy, fearful of his surroundings, afraid of
death. He had three short attacks of unconsciousness. At one
period he had visions of angels, and for a few minutes a euphoric
state. The entire episode lasted a little over an hour, after
which he went to sleep. This subject had a similar psychotic
episode after taking 120 mg. of tetrahydrocannabinol. On seven
other occasions he had been given the marihuana concentrate or
tetrahydrocannabinol with no unusual effects. </p>

<p>Of the physical symptoms occurring with smoking, dryness of
the mouth and throat, dizziness, and a sensation of hunger were
the most common. None of these or other symptoms seemed to lessen
materially the pleasurable effects. </p>

<p>The effect of smoking on the 7 females, 6 of whom were classed
as users, corresponded to that on the male group. All showed
euphoric effects. One of the subjects was nauseated and another
was restless, irritable, and contrary. These effects were
observed in both of the subjects when marihuana was taken by
stomach. One of the users, euphoric after smoking 6 and 10
cigarettes, had a psychotic episode after 8 cc. of marihuana
concentrate. </p>

<p>Tea-Pad Parties. (This section on &quot;Tea-Pad Parties&quot;
was prepared by Mrs. Halpern.) In addition to the quantitative
data regularly obtained from the subject during the course of the
testing program, the examiner had opportunity to make diverse
observations of the subject's global reactions, which threw
interesting light on the general effect of the drug on the
individual personality. </p>

<p>When the subject became &quot;high,&quot; his inclination was
to laugh, talk, sing, listen to music, or sleep, but the
requirement that he solve problems, answer questions, or remember
drawings created an artificial situation, tending to bring him
&quot;down&quot; and spoil his pleasure. In order, therefore,
that the influence of the drug might be observed in less formal
circumstances and in a set-up more nearly like the customary
&quot;tea-pad,&quot; two groups of men were given
&quot;parties&quot; on the last night of their hospital sojourn.
The men were consulted beforehand, and the stage was set
according to their desires. They requested that nothing be done
until it was really dark outside. They brought the radio into the
room where the smoking took place and turned it to soft dance
music. Only one shaded light burned, leaving the greater part of
the room shadowy. The suggestion was made that easy chairs or
floor cushions be procured but the party progressed without
these. </p>

<p>The men were allowed as many cigarettes as they wanted. When
the &quot;reefers&quot; were passed out they crowded around with
their hands outstretched like little children begging for candy.
The number of cigarettes the men smoked varied, the range being
from two to twelve or thirteen. There were both users and
non-users in these two groups. The users of course were highly
elated at the prospect of getting much free &quot;tea,&quot; and
some of the non-users also smoked with genuine enjoyment. </p>

<p>In the beginning the men broke up into little groups of twos
and threes to do their smoking, or in some instances went off by
themselves. Smoke soon filled the atmosphere and added to the
general shadowy effect. After the initial smoking there was some
moving about- some men laughed and joked, some became
argumentative, while some just stared out of the window. The
arguments never seemed to get anywhere, although they often dealt
with important problems, and the illogical reasoning used was
never recognized or refuted by the person to whom it was
addressed. Gradually, as though attracted by some force, all
restlessness and activity ceased, and the men sat in a circle
about the radio. </p>

<p>Occasionally they whispered to one another, laughed a little,
or swayed to the music, but in general they relaxed quietly in
their chairs. A feeling of contentment seemed to pervade, and
when one man suddenly got a &quot;laughing jag&quot; they were
annoyed at the interruption. </p>

<p>In general, they gave the impression of adolescent boys doing
something which was forbidden and thereby adding spice to the
indulgence. Many of the adolescent personality patterns as they
appear in group activities were clearly observable here. There
was the eternal &quot;wisecracker,&quot; the domineering
&quot;important&quot; individual who tried to tell everyone what
to do, the silly, giggling adolescent and the shy, withdrawn
introvert. One forgot that these were actually adults with all
the usual adult responsibilities. One could not help drawing the
conclusion that they too had forgotten this for the time being. </p>

<p>Although urged to smoke more, no subject could be persuaded to
take more than he knew or felt he could handle. After about an
hour and half of smoking, the men were given coffee and bread and
jam and the party broke up. They all went to bed and reported the
next day that they had slept very well. </p>

<p>Another attempt at evaluating the effect of marihuana in less
formal situations was made in the following manner. The examiner,
one of the police officers and the subjects listened to Jack
Benny on the Jello Program at 7 o'clock Sunday evening. The
police officer noted the number of times the audience laughed,
and the length of time the laughter lasted. The examiner checked
these items for the subjects. The first time this was done
without marihuana; the following week the subjects were given
several &quot;reefers&quot; about fifteen minutes before the
radio program started. The results were as follows: </p>

<p>Without drug, the subjects laughed 42 times as against 72
laughs in the radio audience. The total time for all laughs was
63 seconds as compared with 139 seconds for the radio audience.
With cigarettes the subjects laughed 43 times as compared with 47
laughs in the audience, the total laugh time being 129 seconds as
compared with 173 seconds of laughter in the audience. Without
drug, the subjects laughed, roughly speaking, only half as often
and as long as the audience- while under the drug they laughed
almost as often and the laugh time was about 75 per cent that of
the audience. </p>

<p>It is obvious that under marihuana the subject laughs more
readily and for longer time intervals. This is probably due both
to the fact that things seem funnier to him and because when
under the influence of the drug he is less inhibited.<br>
</p>

<p><b><u>Differences Between Concentrate and Cigarette</u></b> </p>

<p>When marihuana was ingested, it was in the form of the
concentrate, containing all the active principles which are
soluble in the medium used. The relative proportions of the
principles present are unknown, and the effects can be assumed to
give a composite picture of different actions, the dominating one
being that of tetrahydrocannabinol. There is no information
available concerning the principles present in marihuana smoke,
and it is possible that some of those found in the concentrate
have been destroyed by the heat of combustion. The effects from
smoking correspond to those induced by tetrahydrocannabinol taken
by stomach, so it may be assumed that this principle is present
in the smoke. The rapidity with which effects occur after smoking
demonstrates the quick absorption of the cannabinol from the
respiratory tract and the short duration of these effects
indicates its prompt excretion or detoxification. When the
concentrate is taken, the absorption from the intestinal tract is
slower and more prolonged. For these reasons it is not possible
to make a precise comparison between the effects of the two forms
of administration. </p>

<p>In general the subject's consciousness of unpleasant symptoms
is more marked when the concentrate is taken and this may
interrupt or obscure the pleasant effects. The long duration of
action and the inability of the subject to stop it serve to
accentuate the physical symptoms and to cause apprehension
concerning what may happen. </p>

<p>The result of all this readily accounts for the irritability,
negativism and antagonism occurring. The lessening of inhibitions
is not peculiar to marihuana, for in a few subjects who were
given alcohol in intoxicating doses the behavior corresponded to
that induced by marihuana. </p>

<p>After smoking the main effect was of a euphoric type. Some
dizziness and dryness of the mouth were generally present but
were not pronounced enough to distract from the pleasant
sensations. The condition described as &quot;high&quot; came on
promptly and increased with the number of cigarettes smoked, but
it was not alarming or definitely disagreeable, and did not give
rise to antisocial behavior. </p>

<p>On the contrary it prompted sociability. The marihuana was
under the subject's control, and once the euphoric state was
present, which might come from only one cigarette, he had no
inclination to increase it by more smoking. When a considerable
number of cigarettes were smoked, the effect was usually one of
drowsiness and fatigue. </p>

<p>The description of the &quot;tea-pad parties&quot; brings out
clearly the convivial effect on the groups and the absence of any
rough or antagonistic behavior.<br>

<p><b>The LaGuardia Committee Report on Marihuana</b> </p>

<h1>SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION</h1>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Under the influence of marihuana changes in personality as
shown by alterations in test performance are slight. They are not
statistically significant and indicate only tendencies or trends.
Moreover, the drug effect is not always in proportion to the
amount taken, nor are the changes consistently in one direction.
In many instances the effect of small doses (2 cc.) or of
marihuana cigarettes is the opposite of the effect of larger
doses (5 cc.) (2) </p>

<p>(2) While sufficient experimentation has not been made to
validate the finding, it should be noted that the personality
changes produced by 2 cc. or marihuana cigarettes are almost
always in agreement in contrast to the changes resulting from the
ingestion of 5 cc. The 2 cc. Dosage apparently more nearly
approximates the amount a person would take if left to his own
devices. </p>

<p>The personality changes observed when the subject is under the
influence of 2 cc. of marihuana or marihuana cigarettes
demonstrate that the subject experiences some reduction in drive,
less objectivity in evaluating situations, less aggression, more
self-confidence and a generally more favorable attitude toward
himself. These reactions can be ascribed to two main causes,
namely, an increased feeling of relaxation and disinhibition and
increased self-confidence. As the drug relaxes the subject, the
restraints which he normally imposes on himself are loosened and
he talks more freely than he does in his undrugged state. Things
which under ordinary circumstances he would not speak about are
now given expression. Metaphysical problems which in the
undrugged state he would be unwilling to discuss, sexual ideas he
would ordinarily hesitate to mention, jokes without point, are
all part of the oral stream released by the marihuana. </p>

<p>At the same time that he verbalizes more freely, there is a
reduction in the individual's critical faculty. This is probably
due both to the intellectual confusion produced by the drug and
to the less exacting attitude his feeling of relaxation induces.
He holds himself less rigidly to the standards of his undrugged
phase and does not drive himself to achieve. He is satisfied with
himself and willing to accept himself as he is. This
self-satisfaction undoubtedly helps produce the feeling of
self-confidence which allows the subject to come out more freely
in fields which he formerly avoided. This increased confidence
expresses itself primarily through oral rather than physical
channels. Physically the subject reports pleasant sensations of
&quot;drifting&quot; and &quot;floating&quot; and he allows
himself to become enveloped in a pleasant lassitude. </p>

<p>After the administration of larger doses of marihuana (5 cc.)
the pleasurable sensations appear to be outweighed by concomitant
feelings of anxiety'and, in some cases, of physical distress,
such as nausea. Under these circumstances, for many subjects
there is little increase in confidence but rather heightened
insecurity which precludes outgoing reactions and tends to evoke
generally negativistic attitudes to most stimuli. </p>

<p>It is important to note that neither the ingestion of
marihuana nor the smoking of marihuana cigarettes affects the
basic outlook of the individual except in a very few instances
and to a very slight degree. In general the subjects who are
withdrawn and introversive stay that way, those who are outgoing
remain so, and so on. Where changes occur the shift is so slight
as to be negligible. In other words reactions which are natively
alien to the individual cannot be induced by the ingestion or
smoking of the drug. </p>

<p>Although in most instances the effects of the drug are the
same for the user and the non-user, there are some differences
both in kind and extent. Where the effects for the two groups are
in the same direction they generally are more marked in the case
of the non-user. This is not unexpected in view of the non-user's
lack of habituation to the drug action. For the nonuser his
present experience is a strange, even hazardous one, and the
uncertainty and anxiety attendant upon this impairs the sense of
well-being which the drug produces in the user. Thus the non-user
frequently feels-less secure when he is &quot;high&quot; than he
does normally and is less well adjusted than he is in ordinary
circumstances. </p>

<p>When the productions of the undrugged marihuana user are
studied, certain personality traits which serve to differentiate
him from the non-user and from the &quot;average&quot; individual
can be discerned. As a group the marihuana users studied here
were either inhibited emotionally or turned in on themselves,
making little response to stimuli in the world about them. People
with this type of personality generally have difficulty adjusting
to others and are not at ease in social situations. This
withdrawal from social contacts apparently finds little
compensatory or sublimating activity elsewhere. These subjects
did not have a desire or urge to occupy themselves creatively in
a manner which might prove socially useful. They showed a
tendency to drift along in passive fashion and gave a good
portion of their attention to relatively unimportant matters.
These men were poorly adjusted, lonely and insecure. As indicated
by their history they seldom achieved good heterosexual
adjustment. </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS </p>

<ol>
    <li>Under the influence of marihuana the basic personality
        structure of the individual does not change but some of
        the more superficial aspects of his behavior show
        alteration. </li>
    <li>With the use of marihuana the individual experiences
        increased feelings of relaxation, disinhibition and
        self-confidence. </li>
    <li>The new feeling of self-confidence induced by the drug
        expresses itself primarily through oral rather than
        through physical activity. There is some indication of a
        diminution in physical activity. </li>
    <li>The disinhibition which results from the use of marihuana
        releases what is latent in the individual's thoughts and
        emotions but does not evoke responses which would be
        totally alien to him in his undrugged state. </li>
    <li>Marihuana not only releases pleasant reactions but also
        feelings of anxiety. </li>
    <li>Individuals with a limited capacity for effective
        experience and who have difficulty in making social
        contacts are more likely to resort to marihuana than
        those more capable of outgoing responses. </li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p><b>Family and Community Ideologies</b> </p>

<p>Adolph G. Woltrnann, MA </p>

<p>At the outset of the study it seemed worth while to supplement
the quantitative data by some qualitative procedures of the
projective type which might throw light on the social reactions
of the individuals who were being studied. One of the methods
that has shown its possibilities, particularly in its use with
children, is the play technique in which the individual is
permitted to give free expression to some of his unconscious
motivations in a way that is not immediately apparent to him. The
limitation of this technique is the fact that it is highly
interpretive, but it has the advantage of permitting observations
of the subject's personality reactions in problem situations. </p>

<p>Such a study was accordingly carried out on 18 subjects in the
early part of the investigation. </p>

<p>METHOD </p>

<p>Two situations were studied: one, subsequently to be referred
to as the family set-up, in which toys were used to build an
apartment or home, and another, subsequently to be known as the
community set- up, in which a second variety of toys were used to
construct a town setting. </p>

<p>The Family Set-up </p>

<p>The equipment used in this part of the study consisted of a
box of household toys of the type available in the ten-cent
store, including beds, dressers, chairs, tables, sinks, a stove,
a bathtub, a wash basin, a piano, lamps, flower boxes, a
telephone, doll sets of a man, woman, boy, girl, and maid, and,
in addition, several small wooden slats which were intended to be
used as room partitions. </p>

<p>The box of toys and materials was presented to the subject
with the following directions: &quot;Here are a number of toys
which can be placed in such a manner that a house can be built
from them. You are supposed to be this doll (man). Go ahead and
build yourself a house or apartment. You may use as few or as
many toys as you wish. You may also make believe you are a
bachelor or a married man with or without a family.&quot; </p>

<p>The Community Set-up </p>

<p>In studying the community set-up the following items were
employed: eighteen wooden houses, trees, cars, trucks, fire
engines, an ambulance, a radio police car, a railroad train,
airplanes, and numerous figures representing men, women, and
children from different walks of life. All these toys were handed
to the subject at the same time with the instruction to build a
town or city. As in the family set-up, no further help or
suggestions were given. </p>

<p>The actual method of handling these materials allows for two
approaches. In the free method the subject is encouraged to play
with any toy and to create and act out any situation that the
nature of the toy suggests to him. No help, clues, or hints are
given. In the controlled methods either the subject is told to
create a specific pattern or his responses and reactions to a
predetermined particular situation are elicited. Both methods
were used in this study. </p>

<p>After the subject had completed either his family or his
community set-up and answered questions regarding certain
situations about which the examiner had questioned him the
following points were investigated: ( 1 ) subject's marital
status, both real and assumed; (2) type of home he built for
himself (number of rooms, type of furnishing); (3) subject's
assumed occupation; (4) monthly income and rent which he posited;
(S) his reaction to attempted burglary; (6) his reaction to his
wife's and his own infidelity; and (7) the attitude he would take
toward civic problems if given a position of responsibility such
as mayor. In addition, the examiner appraised the subject's
neatness and orderliness in his home and community setup. The
experiment was given first when the subject was undrugged and
then when he was under the influence of marihuana. </p>

<p><b>FINDINGS</b> </p>

<p>Results were collated in terms of the type and frequency of
responses to different situations both before and after taking
marihuana and in terms of number of items (toys) employed in the
set- up, as, for example, in the case of the home situation, the
number of rooms the subject thought necessary for his apartment
and the amount of rent he thought he ought to pay and its
relation to the income he posited for himself; in the case of the
community set- up, the number of times the subject provided for
ambulances, firemen, and policemen; in the case of the subject's
reaction to burglary, whether he took a passive or a resistant
attitude toward the burglary and whether he assumed the burglar
had absconded with most of the property and so on; in the case of
his attitude toward his wife's adultery, whether he thought he
ought to divorce her or try for reconciliation; and, when the
subject was unfaithful, whether he thought his wife ought to
forgive his delinquency. </p>

<p>In most cases comparisons between responses or reactions
showed little difference in attitude before and after the
ingestion of marihuana and therefore it would not be too
profitable in this short summary of the work to present all the
data obtained. However, by way of illustrating the type of
material procured, the following tables are given: </p>

<p>(TABLE 20) </p>

<p>(TABLE 21) </p>

<p>The majority of the patients, though unmarried in real life,
assumed families and responsibilities in the play situation, and
in a free situation acted out family activities and ideologies.
These figures reveal that, on the average, the subjects when
under the influence of the drug tended to build apartments with
somewhat fewer rooms. The impression of the examiner was that
this was due primarily to the subject's desire to get through
with the task as quickly as possible in order to return to his
room to rest and sleep. </p>

<p>(TABLE 22) </p>

<p>A &quot;make-believe&quot; sickness or accident necessitating
the use of an ambulance was the most frequently observed play
pattern. When the subjects were under the influence of the drug
the incidence of the ambulance and the police was considerably
less than it was when they were in the undrugged state. </p>

<p>(TABLE 23) </p>

<p>The most frequent form of passive reaction to his wife's
infidelity was that the subject would pack up and leave home. The
aggressive reactions consisted of ordering the wife out of the
home in three instances, jailing the wife and lover in one
instance, throwing the wife out in one instance, killing the
lover but leaving the wife unmolested in one instance, and
beating up the lover and leaving the wife unharmed in one
instance. </p>

<p>The following are examples of subjects' responses to the
adultery situation. When he was facing the pretended situation
before taking marihuana, one subject immediately left his house,
borrowed money from his employer, and traveled to the West Coast.
After he arrived there he proceeded to drink and in due time
became a derelict on the Barbary Coast. When asked about his
children he said, &quot;That's closed with the rest of the
chapter. Let her ardent lover support the children. I take on an
assumed name. Others might get a divorce and custody of the
children but in my case my home life would be a closed
chapter.&quot; After the administration of marihuana he still
showed a passive attitude, but, having assumed the role of a
psychologist, he felt obliged to act accordingly. At first he
considered divorce action, but since that would deprive the
children of a home, he finally forgave his wife. Then he stopped
in his contemplations, looked at the examiner and said, &quot;Why
do I become altruistic? . . . That's beyond me . . . Maybe I
become a martyr . . . I commit an act of martyrdom.&quot; Another
subject, when in the undrugged condition, ordered his wife out of
the house and later divorced her. In the drugged state customary
procedures were reversed. The subject went to his parents and
remained passively at home while his mother unsuccessfully tried
to bring about a reconciliation. </p>

<p>The subject's attitude toward adultery did not change in the
drugged state. The data in Table 24 illustrate the fact that
ingestion of marihuana generally does not alter the subject's
basic attitude. </p>

<p>(TABLE 24) </p>

<p>Practically all the subjects approved of saloons. Gambling was
rejected because it deprives wives and children of money and
leads to trouble. A heavy loser may try to recoup his losses
through holdups, and fights and homicide may develop from
quarrels. Prostitution was condoned by about 5O per cent of the
subjects both before and after the ingestion of the drug, but the
use of marihuana was frowned upon more often when the subject was
undrugged than when he was in the drugged state. </p>

<p>(TABLE 25) </p>

<hr>

<p><b>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS<br>
</b></p>

<p>Eighteen subjects who participated in the marihuana study were
subjected to the play situation with the idea of seeing whether
the pattern of play or the ideas investigated were materially
altered in consequence of the ingestion of the marihuana. Among
the ideologies which were appraised were: (1) attitude toward
family set-up; (2) attitude toward different occupations; (3)
attitude toward income; (4) attitude toward situations ordinarily
calling for aggression, namely an attempted burglary of his home
and sexual infidelity on the part of his wife; (5) attitude
toward authority. </p>

<p>In general the subject's attitude toward family and community
ideologies as manifested in play did not change markedly as a
result of the ingestion of marihuana. The subjects (in play) were
not intolerant of infidelity or aggressive toward lawbreakers
either before or after the ingestion of marihuana. On the whole
the initial passive reactions already observed in other parts of
the study were likewise observed in the play situation
experiment. The only very definite change as a result of the
ingestion of marihuana was in their attitude toward the drug
itself. Without marihuana only 4 out of 14 subjects said they
would tolerate the sale of marihuana while after ingestion 8 of
them were in favor of this. </p>

<p>Another significant manifestation in the play situation
pertains to the construction of the community set-up. In general
the community was less orderly and well organized when the
subjects had had marihuana. It is probable that this poor
organization may be ascribed to the generally indifferent
attitude and lack of motor coordination already observed in the
more controlled studies. </p>

<p>On the whole, the experiment with play technique gave less
information as to the effect of marihuana on subjects than had
been hoped for. This may have been due to the incompleteness of
the method employed or possibly to the fact that this technique
is designed to give data about the basic personality of the
individual rather than such alterations in it as might be caused
by pharmacological agents.<br>

<p> <b><font size="4">Introduction<br>
</font></b> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Throughout the twentieth century the
government of the United States has engaged, in one form or
another, in efforts to prevent its citizens from using certain
designated psychoactive drugs. The use of nonapproved drugs has
been defined as illegal, and billions of taxpayer dollars have
been spent and millions of man-hours devoted to curtailing the
availability of such drugs. Yet in spite of these efforts there
are now as many users and abusers of illicit drugs as ever
before. Similarly, the misuse of legally available drugs has
dramatically increased.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Data on the use of illicit drugs do not
conclusively demonstrate that the federal government's antidrug
efforts have failed, but they do provide compelling reasons to
undertake a thorough reappraisal of federal policies and
programs. Evaluations made by both federal government study
groups and private organizations' have resulted in
changes-particularly in preventive and treatment approaches-but
federal drug policies have remained fundamentally the same for
decades.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">This chapter will concentrate on the response
of the federal government to the issues of illicit drug use <b>and
</b>misuse from 1969 to the present. It was during this period
that our country experienced an unprecedented growth in the
governmental response to the use of illicit drugs. This period
also roughly coincides with the years during which the Drug Abuse
Council has been studying drug issues and policy.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">To understand the U.S. government's response
to illicit drugs in the 1970s it is necessary to know something
of the history. Our nation's current drug policies and programs
are the result of over seventy years of development. Detailed
analyses such as those provided by David </font><font size="1">Musto2
</font><font size="2">and Rufus King3 offer insight into this
process. It is clear from these analyses that the government's
response to public fear of certain drugs and drug users has
primarily consisted of law enforcement or quasi-enforcement
strategies intended to prohibit both new and continued use of
nonapproved substances. The belief that some drugs are so
innately harmful that the citizens of this country should and
could be prevented from using them has been the basic tenet of
American drug policy for the past seven decades.<br>
<br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <b>Historical Review <br>
</b> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Several major pieces of drug legislation and
presidential initiatives have shaped public policy in the drug
field. The first pertinent legislation in this area passed by
Congress was the District of Columbia Pharmacy Act in </font><font
size="1">1906.4 </font><font size="2">Although this act applied
only to the District of Columbia, it set a precedent for Congress
to deal with drug issues. This act permitted a physician to
prescribe narcotics to addicts, but only when &quot;necessary for
the cure&quot; of addiction; the prescription of narcotic drugs
to nonaddicted persons was limited to the treatment of injury or
disease. The intent of the act was to prevent the further -spread
of addictive drug use. It first raised the difficult
philosophical question of government regulation of physician
prescribing practices with respect to addictive drugs, an issue
still actively debated.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The Harrison Narcotic Act,' passed in late
1914, marked the official entry of the government into the area
of narcotics control. This act simplified record keeping on the
dispensation of certain narcotic drugs, and required that
standard forms be filed and maintained for two years on the sales
of narcotic drugs. Revenue agents could inspect these records at
will. However, physicians were allowed to dispense drugs without
keeping records if in actual attendance on their patients.
Numerous patent medicines containing small amounts of morphine,
cocaine, opium, and heroin were still permitted to be sold by
mail order or in general stores.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Through regulations issued by the Treasury
Department pursuant to the Harrison Narcotic Act, the federal
government hampered the treatment of heroin and morphine
addiction to such a degree that by the early 1920s those clinics
in the country which regularly provided opiates to registered
addicts (so-called &quot;maintenance clinics&quot;) were closed,
and few private physicians dared to provide these drugs to
addicts </font><font size="1">. 6 </font><font size="2">This
effectively ended the medical profession's active involvement in
the treatment of drug addiction until the 1960s. From the 1920s
on, the federal government was for all practical purposes in
charge of attempts to control illicit drug use. Although there
were, at the time, serious questions raised about the
constitutionality of using federal police powers to restrict, and
eventually prohibit, the use of certain drugs, the popular belief
was that the use of these drugs must be eliminated even when
occurring in the context of medical treatment for addiction.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">In 1929 Congress passed the Porter Act </font><font
size="1">7 </font><font size="2">ostensibly addressing the
treatment needs of convicted addicts. The Porter Act called for
the building of two narcotics &quot;farms&quot; in which those
convicted of the &quot;crime&quot; of drug addiction would be
housed in order to receive compulsory treatment. The underlying
assumption of the act seemed to be that treatment-enforced
abstinence-required isolation and a controlled environment.
Although the Porter Act became law in January 1929, the first
farm did not open until 1935 in Lexington, Kentucky. A second
farm opened in 1938 in Fort Worth, Texas. The treatment rendered
at these farms was not successful, with most addicts returning to
addiction after discharge.&quot; In reality the farms were little
more than specialized prisons. In fact, Musto reports that
&quot;not until the late 1960s were the bars removed from the
Lexington facility and the cells turned into rooms.&quot;9</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">In 1930 the first federal agency specifically
devoted to the control of illicit drugs, the Federal Bureau of
Narcotics (FBN), was established. Because the federal regulation
of narcotic drugs was based on the taxing power of Congress, the
FBN was made part of the Treasury Department and was concerned
only with enforcement issues. The FBN was responsible, at least
initially, for enforcing the Harrison Narcotic Act and
controlling only what were then thought of as the most dangerous
drugs-cocaine and the opiates. The FBN's policies were predicated
on the belief that &quot;the most effective way of gaining public
compliance with a law regulating a dangerous drug was a policy of
high fines and severe mandatory prison sentences for first
convictions.&quot; 10</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The FBN did not initially support a federal
antimarijuana effort. However, newspaper accounts of serious
crimes attributed to marijuana users and the drug's &quot;Mexican
purveyors&quot; triggered a series of events that culminated in
the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937. 11 The FBN changed
its policies after this act was passed, vigorously enforcing the
federal laws prohibiting marijuana. </font><b><font size="1">12</font></b>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Passage of the Marihuana Tax Act in effect
imposed a total prohibition on marijuana use. Marijuana was
described in congressional hearings as impairing the ability to
think rationally, dangerous to the mind and body, and leading to
insanity. It was further claimed that marijuana led to the
commission of violent crimes, spread drug use to school children,
and resulted in impotence in the habitual user. It was not until
the early 1970s that many of these views began to be modified. To
this day, however, their effects on public attitudes and policies
linger.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">During the late 1940s and early 1950s there
were reports that rates of heroin addiction had risen,
particularly in inner-city minority communities. This period
coincided with the beginning of the so-called &quot;McCarthy
era,&quot; a time when public fear of nonconforming behavior was
high and tolerance of it low. Drugs were linked to communism. As
David Musto has written, &quot;The Federal Bureau of Narcotics
linked Red China's attempts to get hard cash, as well as to
destroy Western society, to the clandestine sale of large amounts
of heroin to drug pushers in the United States.&quot;13 In
addition, a theory that addicts began with marijuana use and
moved inexorably to the use of heroin (or morphine or
cocaine)-the progression&quot; or &quot;stepping-stone&quot;
theory-was widely believed.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In this atmosphere, the Boggs </font><font
size="1">Act14 was passed in late 1951. The </font><font size="2">Boggs
Act increased penalties for all drug law violators and for the
first time made penalties for violation of the marijuana laws the
same as those for narcotic drugs. This act also introduced, at
the federal level, the concept of minimum mandatory jail
sentences for drug law offenders.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The Boggs Act-and later amendments which
further increased penalties </font><b><font size="1">15</font></b><font
size="1"> </font><font size="2">-reflected an undeviating
reliance on law enforcement activities and harsh penalties to
deal with the perceived &quot;drug menace.&quot; The Boggs
Act-and the later Narcotic Control Act of 1956-passed after only
cursory hearings, which did not delve into either the causes or
the nature of the use of illicit drugs. The widespread fear of
communism and intolerance of nonconforming views and behavior at
the time made it politically feasible-even desirable-to advocate
reliance on the criminal justice system to control and punish
narcotics users. The need for treatment was ignored. Most
Americans directly affected by these laws were politically
impotent, disliked, and distrusted because of prevailing racial
and ethnic prejudices.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The first notice of change in official
attitudes came in 1963 with President Kennedy's appointment of an
Advisory Commission on Narcotic and Drug Abuse (the Prettyman
Commission) to review the nation's drug problems and the
government's response to them. The Prettyman Commission report </font><font
size="1">16 </font><font size="2">challenged many of the
assumptions which had long dominated official thinking in the
drug area. It recommended a decreased use of minimum mandatory
sentences, an increase in appropriations for research, and the
transfer of the FBN to the Department of Health, Education, and
Welfare. It also recommended that the final judgment on the
legitimate medical use of narcotics be given back to the medical
profession.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The Prettyman Commission noted the
fragmentation of federal activities in the drug field and
recommended that &quot;the President appoint a Special Assistant
for Narcotic and Drug Abuse from the White House staff to provide
continuous advice and assistance in launching a coordinated
attack. </font><font size="1">&quot; 17 </font><font size="2">Although
the commission made many recommendations, few were implemented at
that time.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">One recommendation of the commission which did
receive attention was that a civil commitment system be
established &quot;to provide an alternative method of handling
the federally convicted offender who is a confirmed narcotic or
marijuana abuser.&quot; Such a system was instituted by the
Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act of 1966 (NARA).&quot;'
Although NARA ostensibly considered drug addiction a
&quot;medical problem,&quot; addicts committed under NARA
programs were basically perceived as prisoners.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">By the mid-1960s, illicit drug use had become
a highly visible and emotional issue throughout the United
States. It was widely believed that illicit drug use was
increasing rapidly and for the first time reaching into the
suburbs and affecting white middle-class youth. News reports
often tended toward sensationalism in presenting stories on LSD
and hallucinogenic drug use on college campuses. Anti-Vietnam War
protesters became identified with marijuana use. The use of
illicit drugs was, in general, identified as an antisocial
gesture and was associated in the public's mind with mental
illness and rising rates of street crime.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In February 1968 President Johnson established
&quot;a new and powerful Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs
(BNDD)&quot; within the justice Department.&quot;' Johnson had
seen that the federal enforcement of narcotics laws was
fragmented. The Federal Bureau of Narcotics in the Treasury
Department had some responsibilities, while the Bureau of Drug
Abuse Control (BDAC)-an agency created only three years earlier
in 1965 in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare-had
been assigned certain regulatory functions having to do with
nonnarcotic drugs. In an attempt to unify the federal response,
the FBN and BDAC were abolished and the new BNDD was given full
authority to enforce all U.S. narcotics laws, from worldwide
operations to work with state and local law enforcement
officials. In addition, BNDD was directed to &quot;conduct an
extensive campaign of research and a nationwide public education
program on drug abuse and its tragic effects.&quot; In fact, in
President Johnson's message to Congress proposing Reorganization
Plan No. 1, the only mention of any federal effort in research-
treatment, or education was in the context of the justice
Department's BNDD. The emphasis was again on law enforcement and
the relationship between drugs and crime.<br>

<hr>

<p> <b><font size="2">Understanding the Growth of the
Governmental Response to Illicit Drugs<br>
</font></b> </p>

<p> <font size="2">During Richard Nixon's presidential terms, the
issue of &quot;drug abuse&quot; was given a higher priority and
greater visibility than at any other time in our country's
history. In January 1969 the annual federal. budget for drug
treatment, education, research, and law enforcement was $81.4
million; five years later it was $760 million-nearly a tenfold
increase. A series of major legislative, organizational, and
programmatic changes accompanied these dramatic budget increases.
The reasons for this enormous increase in the federal response
can be traced to three unforeseen circumstances of need and
opportunity. </font> </p>

<p> <b><font size="2">The Need to Reduce Rates of Urban Street
Crime. </font></b><font size="2">Rising street crime was a key
issue in the 1968 presidential campaign. The urban riots of the
mid-1960s and the rising crime-rate figures issued by the FBI
provided fuel for much of the campaign rhetoric about the growing
&quot;lawlessness&quot; and &quot;violence&quot; of America.
&quot;Law and order&quot; emerged as the dominant domestic theme
of the 1968 Republican presidential campaign </font><font
size="1">.20</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Campaign promises to &quot;get tough&quot;
with urban street crime are historically easier to make than to
fulfill. The jurisdiction and power of the federal government to
prevent burglaries and armed robberies-among the most common
types of urban street crime--are limited. Except in the District
of Columbia, such violations are usually matters for state, not
federal, action. Even if Congress had extended the legal
authority of the federal law enforcement agencies, these agencies
(FBI, IRS, BNDD) did not have the manpower to address urban
street crime effectively.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In spite of the passage of &quot;tough&quot;
legislation such as preventive detention, harsh prison sentences,
and &quot;no-knock&quot; warrantless searches, crime rates
continued to rise, as reported by the FBI, jeopardizing the
administration's promised law and order. Even in the District of
Columbia, where the federal government could exercise some
contrcl, the crime rate increased during the first year of the
Nixon presidency.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Clearly, from a political perspective the
Nixon administration needed to show progress in some area of
crime control before the 1972 election. This was one element
underlying the growth since 1969 of the federal government's
efforts to control the use of illicit drugs.</font> </p>

<p> <b><font size="2">The Public's Increasing Concern About
Heroin Addiction. </font></b><font size="2">The association of
illicit drug use with street crime and violence developed over a
long period of time. By the late 1960s, the relationship between
heroin &quot;addiction' and street crime was generally accepted
as fact, despite the absence of any careful research and
documentation. 22 Heroin had become inextricably linked in the
public's mind with the urban crisis; and as public anxiety about
crime grew, so too did the fear of heroin and heroin addicts.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">The public's fear of heroin was intensified by
reports of increased use of narcotics among American soldiers
stationed in Vietnam. The thought of &quot;soldier-junkies,&quot;
trained in guerrilla warfare, returning to the streets of urban
America heightened public concern and led to further demands for
government action. &quot;Drug abuse&quot; (particularly heroin
addiction) rapidly became a major public concern, as reflected in
the opinion polls of that time, adding another argument for an
expanded government effort.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">But neither the need for an effective crime
reduction program nor the growing public concern about heroin
explain by themselves the increased federal response: a third
element was crucial. In all likelihood the government's efforts
to prevent &quot;drug abuse&quot; would have expanded without
this third element, but it is doubtful that the expansion would
have been anywhere near the same magnitude.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">* In the late 1960s no distinction was made
between heroin use and heroin addiction-all use of heroin was
believed addictive. More recent studies indicate that this is not
necessarily accurate.21<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <b><font size="2">The Emergence of New Approaches to the
Problem of Heroin Addiction. </font></b><font size="2">Three new
avenues of response to the problems of heroin addiction and
heroin-related crime emerged. Although distinct from one another,
these three approaches in time became interrelated in subsequent
government programs. The opportunities they presented led-some
say misled-federal policyrnakers to believe that they could
respond to the problems of heroin addiction more successfully
than previously.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">First, the legislative basis for federal drug
law enforcement efforts changed. Federal regulations and controls
on drugs before 1970 were based primarily on the power to levy
taxes and prohibit traffic in smuggled goods. Thus virtually all
federal drug law enforcement programs were administered by the
Treasury Department-until the creation of the Bureau of Narcotics
and Dangerous Drugs in the justice Department by executive order
in 1968; simultaneously the Treasury Department's Federal Bureau
of Narcotics was abolished. This transfer of jurisdiction was
given a statutory basis in 1970 with the passage of the
Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control </font><font
size="1">Act.2&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">This act addressed a broad range of drug
program efforts, providing increased support for drug treatment,
rehabilitation, and education as well as enforcement. The
enforcement provisions of this legislation (Title II of the act)
were part of a larger attempt to reduce criminal activity through
improved federal law enforcement. Congress and the Nixon
administration sought through this legislation to recodify the
existing drug laws into one comprehensive law. Most narcotics law
enforcement powers were given to the justice Department, thus
allowing the Attorney General to exercise control over all
dangerous drugs (e.g., amphetamines and barbiturates) and
narcotics. This was the first federal law making it illegal to
traffic in or possess certain drugs which did not refer to the
taxing authority. Instead, the justification for federal-as
opposed to state-enforcement was shifted to the power of Congress
to regulate interstate commerce. The concept of the
&quot;interstate commerce&quot; powers of Congress had greatly
expanded in the decades prior to this new drug legislation.
Supreme Court rulings on the &quot;New Deal&quot; legislation of
the 1930s and 1940s and on the civil rights cases of the 1960s
had clearly broadened the scope of activities that Congress could
regulate under its constitutional authority to regulate
&quot;interstate commerce.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">This shift in the constitutional basis of drug
law enforcement allowed the federal government to become more
directly involved in suppressing one presumed major cause of
urban street crime about which there was great public fear. It
offered some hope that expanded and intensified efforts to combat
trafficking in illicit drugs could succeed where past efforts had
failed.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">A second new avenue of response centered
around bilateral agreements to reduce the international flow of
illicit drugs-particularly heroin-into the United States. For
more than sixty years, beginning with the Hague International
Opium Convention of 1912, the United States has negotiated
bilateral and multilateral international agreements to keep
illicit opiates out of the country. Since opium, of which heroin
is a derivative, is not grown anywhere in the United States, all
the heroin used by addicts in this country comes from foreign
sources; hence the concept that if opium is not cultivated
elsewhere, heroin will not be available for use here. Since,
however, it is virtually impossible to prevent the growth of the
opium poppy everywhere, a second line of defense has been to
disrupt international trafficking in opium, its chemical
conversion into heroin in foreign laboratories, and its
subsequent shipment into the United States.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In January 1969, up to 80 percent of the
heroin used in the United States was believed to be of Turkish
origin. The major processing country for converting Turkish opium
into heroin for shipment to American East Coast port cities was
reputed to be France. The operations in these two countries were
frequently blamed for the rising rates of heroin addiction
reported in the United States in the late 1960s.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The Nixon administration sought greater
international cooperation to keep illicit drugs from entering the
United States </font><font size="1">.14 </font><font size="2">In
early 1971, just as public concern about heroin was reaching its
peak, separate agreements were reached with France and Turkey
enlisting their formal assistance in keeping heroin out of the
United States. The French government agreed to take steps to
close down the clandestine laboratories operating principally
around Marseilles and to prevent the traffic of opium into, and
heroin out of, France. The agreement with Turkey-the culmination
of five years of negotiations-amounted to a total. ban on -poppy
cultivation in Turkey in return for American financial aid for
crop substitution programs and income compensation for Turkish
farmers.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">It was anticipated that these two agreements
would significantly reduce the flow of heroin to the United
States, and that the resulting shortage would reduce the levels
of heroin addiction and heroin-related crime. Thcy were touted as
major victories on the international front of the new &quot;war
on drug abuse.&quot; The federal government sought to capitalize
on these agreements by negotiating agreements with other
potential &quot;source&quot; and &quot;processing&quot;
countries. The hoped-for success of these efforts to control
international supplies thus emerged as the second new avenue of
the government's heroin control effort.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The third new avenue of response was the use
of methadone to treat heroin addiction. Methadone is a synthetic
analgesic developed by the Germans during World War 11 as a
substitute for morphine. After the war and throughout the 1950s,
methadone was used in the United States as a detoxifying agent
for heroin addicts. In 1964 Drs. Vincent P. Dole and Marie E.
Nyswander of the Rockefeller Institute in New York City found
that they were able to maintain six heroin addicts on a stable
dosage-level of methadone without their craving heroin. Dole and
Nyswander soon began an expanded program of methadone maintenance
to both demonstrate methadone's potential and evaluate the
program's impact. In 1966 they reported the initial results of
their work: Among the most widely publicized of their results was
that criminal activity among the enrolled addicts had been
&quot;virtually eliminated. </font><font size="1">'125 </font><font
size="2">Public and government interest in the concept of
methadone maintenance grew, and by the late 1960s methadone
programs were in operation in many urban centers, providing
addicts with an alternative to the more traditional forms of
treatment which emphasized abstinence, and which had not proved
successful for large numbers of addicts.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">While methadone maintenance programs are
generally considered &quot;treatment,&quot; particularly by their
staffs and clients, the idea of using methadone treatment as part
of the larger national effort to reduce urban street crime had
begun to take hold by late 1969. The proposition put forth was
that if an addict's dependence on heroin was broken (by
substituting legally prescribed methadone), the crime rate would
be reduced, because-so the theory went-addicts committed a large
proportion of the street crime in order to feed their illicit
habits. A 1970 Domestic Council Summary Option Paper on Drugs
stated, &quot;The Federal government has only one economical and
effective technique for reducing crime in the streets-methadone
maintenance. </font><b><font size="1">-26</font></b> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Methadone thus offered an important new form
of treatment to heroin addicts as well as a possibility of
reducing urban street crime. Which aspect was considered more
important is difficult to determine. In any event, the emergence
of methadone treatment was a crucial -part of the developing
&quot;solution&quot; to the problems of heroin addiction and
heroin-related crime.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Thus in the late 1960s and early 1970s several
new<b> </b>and potentially significant approaches developed. Many
believed that if effectively applied in concert they could
substantially reduce the rate of heroin addiction and associated
problems, particularly the crimes committed to raise money to
support heroin addiction. These developments, coinciding as they
did with the political commitment to reduce urban street crime
and respond to the growing public concern about heroin addiction,
had much to do with the enormous growth of the federal response
to illicit drugs which began in 1969.<br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <b>The Federal Response, 1969-1971 <br>
</b> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In January 1969 the federal government's
response to illicit drugs as measured in dollars spent was small;
$86 million was spent in fiscal year 1969 (FY 69), and only a
modest increase to $101.9 million was requested for FY 70 </font><font
size="1">.27</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The principal federal agencies involved in the
drug field during this period were the National Institute of
Mental Health (NIMH) in the Department of Health, Education, and
Welfare; the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs in the
justice Department; and the Customs Bureau of the Treasury
Department. These three agencies accounted for the bulk of the
federal drug effort in four operational areas: treatment and
rehabilitation; education, prevention, and training; research;
and law enforcement. NIMH was the major federal sponsor of all
non-law-enforcement programs, while BNDD and Customs each held
some responsibility for the federal drug law enforcement effort.
The emergence of BNDD created an intense bureaucratic rivalry
with Customs regarding jurisdictional responsibilities for drug
law enforcement programs. Although this dispute was supposed to
have been settled in 1969 when BNDD was authorized to conduct
overseas operations and Customs was restricted to border
searches, it has surfaced frequently in subsequent years; even
now the situation seems merely a temporary truce. (See Staff
Paper 2, &quot;Drug Law Enforcement Efforts,&quot; below.)</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">The FY 71 budget was the first to be
completely developed by the Nixon administration, and in it the
federal drug budget more than doubled to a total of $212.5
million. The major increases in the FY 71 budget were for
treatment and rehabilitation and education, prevention, and
training. While the drug law enforcement budget rose by more than
50 percent, it was for the first time surpassed in absolute
numbers by expenditures for treatment and rehabilitation, which
by this time were assuming added dimensions as part of the crime
reduction effort (see Figure 1. 1).</font> </p>

<p> <img src="fada1001.gif"> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Since the use of illicit drugs was of growing
public concern and government interest, federal budget makers
were clearly more receptive to agency budget requests for new
drug programs, and by FY 71 there were fifteen separate federal
agencies involved in some kind of drug-related effort. For some,
such as the Office of Education, the Veterans Administration, and
the Department of Transportation, FY 71 marked the first year
they had undertaken specific drug activities. For others, such as
the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Office of
Economic Opportunity, drug-related expenditures, which until then
had been minimal, rose dramatically. This expansion of the
federal drug budget was accompanied by greater problems of
interagency coordination. Although federal response to the use of
illicit drugs was growing, it generally lacked cohesion and
overall purpose (other than a commitment to &quot;solve the drug
problem&quot;). This lack of coordination led Hutt and Wald to
comment in 1972, &quot;Federal activities in the drug abuse field
tend to be <i>ad hoc </i>reactions to current crises rather than
well-considered, long-term programs.11211</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The proposed FY 72 budget, announced in
February 1971, projected a drug budget of $265 million-an
increase of just over $50 million. This proposal envisioned
federal expenditures of $96 million for law enforcement, $101
million for treatment and rehabilitation, $24 million for
research, and $44 million for education, prevention, and
training. By this time there were sixteen separate federal
agencies involved in the drug effort, with little coordination
between them. The resulting bureaucratic nightmare was
graphically depicted in a government report covering all federal
drug efforts except law enforcement (Figure 1.2).</font> <img
src="fada1002.gif"> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In early 1971, the National Commission on
Marihuana and Drug Abuse began work on the first of two
consecutive one-year studies it was to undertake. The appointment
of this federal study commission, the scope of its work, and the
schedule for the completion of its two reports had been
delineated in the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control
Act of 1970. (The Senate and the House of Representatives each
appointed two members to the thirteen-member commission;
President Nixon selected the remaining nine.) Congress had
stipulated that the commission first complete a comprehensive
study of marijuana-related issues by March 1972 (discussed more
fully in Staff Paper 5, &quot;Marijuana and Cocaine,&quot;
below). in the commission's second year, Congress directed it to
complete a more general examination and analysis of the nature,
causes, and significance of the &quot;drug abuse&quot; problem in
the United States, and further directed it to present
recommendations for legislative and administrativ6 actions
consistent with the commission's findings and conclusions.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">However, on June 17, 1971, long before the
scheduled completion of the commission's second report, President
Nixon sent to Congress a special message on drug abuse in which
he requested a supplemental budget of $155 million and a
reorganization of responsibilities regarding drug treatment,
education, prevention, research, and, most notably, coordination.
Citing the immediacy of the drug problem and the need for a more
effective response, Nixon simultaneously issued an executive
order establishing the position of Special Consultant to the
President for Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs in order to
&quot;institute to the extent legally possible&quot; the
legislation which he proposed to Congress. It was at this point
that the fundamental restructuring of the federal government's
response to illicit drugs began.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <b><font size="2">President Nixon's Message to Congress, June
17, 1971.19 </font></b><font size="2">President Nixon's message
to Congress on June 17, 1971 raised the issue of illicit drug use
to the highest level of government concern and responsibility.
This statement was the culminating step in the declaration of a
strong and irrevocable public commitment to reduce the crime
heroin addicts were thought to commit and bring the problems of
illicit drug use under control. &quot;If we cannot destroy the
drug menace in America , Nixon informed Congress and the American
public, &quot;then it will surely in time destroy us. I am not
prepared to accept this alternative.&quot; Although the President
spoke of the general problems of &quot;drug abuse,&quot; there is
little doubt that the chief problems and concerns to which he
referred were those relating to heroin addiction.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Clearly, public alarm about heroin-related
crime and addicted Vietnam veterans demanded a more effective
governmental response than previous ones. Equally clear was the
fact that increased funding alone had not been successful.
According to Nixon: &quot;We must now candidly recognize that the
deliberate procedures embodied in present efforts to control drug
abuse are not sufficient in themselves. The problem has assumed
the dimensions of a national emergency.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Forceful measures were required, so the
thinking went, if the twin problems of heroin addiction and urban
crime were to be curtailed. Speed was essential to the Nixon
administration because of the political aspects of illicit drug
use. Predictably, the policies and programs it advocated were
consistent with enforcement and quasi-enforcement approaches
which had characterized past federal efforts. The government's
response to the use of illicit drugs in 1971 sprang from the same
assumptions about their innate harmfulness and arrived at
fundamentally the same conclusions as had been espoused for more
than sixty years. The changes proposed were those of technique,
size, and scope only.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The president acknowledged the problems of
undirected growth in the government's response. </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">We must recognize that piecemeal efforts, even
where individually successful, cannot have a major impact on the
drug abuse problem unless and until they are forged together into
a broader and more integrated program involving all levels of
government and private effort. We need a coordinated effort if we
are to move effectively against drug abuse.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">A two-sided approach was developed to
coordinate the federal drug effort. On the &quot;supply&quot;
side were all federal drug law enforcement efforts to halt the
illegal production, distribution, and use of prohibited
substances. On the &quot;demand&quot; side were all federally
sponsored efforts at treatment and rehabilitation and education,
prevention, training, and research. Each approach was envisioned
as separate and independent of the other, although they shared
the same goals of eliminating illicit drug use and drug-related
crime in America.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">To control &quot;demand&quot; the Nixon
administration proposed a dramatic reorganization which would
temporarily centralize responsibility for all federally sponsored
efforts in drug treatment, rehabilitation, education, prevention,
training, and research in a new White House Agency, the <b>Special
Action Office for Drug Abuse Prevention (SAODAP). </b>The
director of SAODAP was to be immediately accountable to the
President. From an organizational standpoint it made sense to
coordinate the many federal agencies involved. To have ignored
the management problems displayed in Figure 1.2 above would have
led to further chaos and undercut the potential of any federal
response. However, this does not explain why such coordinative
responsibilities were lodged in the White House under
presidential supervision. Other federal programs also involved a
number of federal agencies, yet coordination could usually be
achieved through more regular bureaucratic measures such as
cabinet- or sub-cabinet-level working agreements. What made the
drug issue different?</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">One explanation lies in the deteriorating
relationship at that time between the White House staff and
various federal agencies. Particularly with respect to the
funding of methadone maintenance programs, the White House felt
that there was considerable bureaucratic &quot;foot-dragging. </font><font
size="1">&quot;30 </font><font size="2">Administration officials
had become persuaded of the benefits of methadone maintenance as
a way to reduce &quot;heroin and criminal recidivism,&quot; but
they had been unsuccessful in gaining the full support and
cooperation of NIMH, the agency which normally would have funded
and overseen these programs. NIMH officials were cautious of
government &quot;sanctioning one addiction [to methadone] in
order to reduce the burden on society of heroin addiction,' and
continued to resist White House pressures to fund a greater
number of methadone programs </font><font size="1">.31 </font><font
size="2">The administration contended that NIMH opposed the
programs because to endorse the concept of methadone maintenance
would have been tantamount to admitting the failure of the
psychiatric profession to successfully treat heroin addiction </font><font
size="1">.32</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">While mention of methadone is made only once
in President Nixon's message to Congress, the proposed creation
of SAODAP and the accompanying redelegation of authority would
help circumvent NIMH and increase federal support for methadone.
The administration sought thus to bypass-since it could not
cajole-a reluctant bureaucracy. The president's designation of
Dr. Jerome Jaffe-a prominent supporter of the use of methadone in
treatment-as his Special Consultant for Narcotics and Dangerous
Drugs until SAODAP could be legally constituted by Congress left
no doubt as to the administration's intention. Indeed, when Dr.
Jaffe assumed leadership responsibilities in mid-1971, there were
135 federally funded drug treatment programs; eighteen months
later, with a significantly increased drug treatment budget, the
number had nearly tripled to 394 </font><font size="1">.33 </font><font
size="2">Treatment for heroin addiction was emphasized in this
program expansion and the rate of growth of methadone treatment
programs was accelerated.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">A second explanation for centralizing
drug-policy-making responsibilities in the White House is that
the administration anticipated a successful campaign against
illicit drug use and drug-related crime and wanted to take
political credit for it. If the needs were great, so were the
opportunities. The president's message to Congress exuded
confidence in spite of the crisis rhetoric in which it was
couched; the message sought to portray illicit drugs as the
villain in a domestic war which could only be won by forceful
presidential leadership, as the following excerpt suggests.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Narcotics addiction is a problem which
afflicts both the body and the soul of America. It is a problem
which baffles many Americans. In our history we have faced great
difficulties again and again, wars and depressions and divisions
among our people have tested our will as a people-and we have
prevailed.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The threat of narcotics among our people is
one which properly frightens many Americans. It comes quietly
into homes and destroys children, it moves into neighborhoods and
breaks the fiber of community which </font><font size="1">makes
neighbors.... And we are not without the will to deal with this
matter. We have the moral resources to do the job. Now we need
the authority and the funds to match our moral resources. I am
confident that we will prevail in this struggle as we have in
many others. But time is critical. Every day we lose compounds
the tragedy which drugs inflict on individual Americans. The
final issue is not whether we will conquer drug abuse, but how
soon.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">The message drew upon traditional perceptions
and fears of illicit drugs and illicit drug users in order to
rally public support for a renewed crusade against a social evil.
The rhetoric was consistent with the tenor of the times. Leading
a war against illicit drugs was certain to enhance any
politician's popularity. And, although the public pronouncements
tended towards the dramatic, the reorganization and expansion
called for, particularly regarding federal efforts in drug
treatment and prevention, were clearly warranted.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">The president's message leaves no doubt that
the administration thought a war against illicit drugs could be
won. The president proposed only a three-to-five-year life for
SAODAP because it was to be &quot;an emergency response to a
national problem which we intend to bring under control.&quot;
This &quot;war&quot; was going to be swift, requiring immediate
and decisive action and sufficient financing. SAODAF's role was
to give the White House direct involvement, visibility, and
credit. <br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <b><font size="2">Development of the Expanded Federal
Response<br>
</font></b> </p>

<p> <font size="1">Having made a public commitment to respond
forcefully to the problems of illicit drug use, the
administration commenced a period of whirlwind activity. Each of
the three new avenues of response-methadone treatment,
international negotiations, and domestic drug law enforcement
programs-were vigorously pursued in an attempt to launch a
comprehensive attack on the perceived problems. Funding was
increased commensurately. In his message to Congress the
president had requested a supplemental budget of $155 million to
bolster the new drug programs. When passed by Congress, this
supplemental appropriation raised the FY 72 drug budget to $418
million-four times what it had been only two years earlier.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="1">Treatment. When he took office in 1971,
President Nixon's new drug advisor, Dr. Jerome Jaffe, turned
first to the problems of the Vietnam soldier and veteran, among
whom rates of addiction were reported to be extraordinarily high.
The drug treatment programs of the Veterans Administration (VA)
were expanded; many new centers opened, enabling the VA to
attract more addicted veterans into treatment. And to stem the
reported flow of drug-addicted soldiers returning to the United
States, the </font><font size="2">Defense Department initiated a
massive urinalysis detection program to screen all Vietnam
servicemen for illicit drug use before they left Southeast Asia;
any heroin- or opiate-using soldiers testing positive were to be
detained for treatment and rehabilitation. President Nixon
informed Congress, &quot;We will be requesting legislation to
permit the military services to retain for treatment any
individual due for discharge who is a narcotic addict. All of our
servicemen must be accorded the right to rehabilitation. </font><font
size="1">1134 </font><font size="2">In all, nearly $50 million of
the president's supplemental budget was applied to expanding the
drug treatment and rehabilitation capabilities of the Defense
Department and Veterans Administration.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The SAODAP staff also immediately assumed
responsibility for directing the expansion of drug treatment
programs throughout the United States. Although NIMH received an
additional $51 million for treatment and rehabilitation as a
result of the supplemental budget, raising its total treatment
and rehabilitation budget to $100 million, control of the
expenditure of these funds was largely shifted from NIMH to
SAODAP and the White House staff. With respct to program
expansion, the emphasis was placed on heroin addiction treatment
and &quot;there was a massive expansion of methadone maintenance
programs throughout the country. </font><font size="1">&quot;35</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">The first new goal of treatment was to enable
any addict who wished it to obtain it without delay. This meant
eliminating the waiting lists for entry at many programs, and
expanding treatment in communities where it was needed but not
yet available. When Dr. Jaffe assumed responsibilities in June
1971, federally funded treatment programs were located in 54
cities; only eighteen months later the number of cities involved
had quadrupled to 214 </font><font size="1">.36 </font><font
size="2">The speed and size of this expansion was dramatic by any
account. The earliest available federal estimate places the
number of clients in federally funded treatment programs at just
ovar twenty thousand in October 1971; by December 1972 the figure
was over sixty thousand </font><font size="1">.37</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The only recognized approaches for heroin
addiction other than the expanding methadone treatment were
abstinence oriented and usually took place in a residential
community setting. While popular and sonletimes effective
treatment approaches for small numbers of addicts, these
abstinence programs had not and-according to federal policy
makerscould not have a significant impact on urban crime.
Methadone thus became a new hope, in spite of the objections of
the Food and Drug Administration about insufficient research or
the opposition from minority communities about the underlying
philosophy of using one addictive drug to treat another </font><font
size="1">.311 </font><font size="2">In December 1972, the Food
and Drug Administration published new regulations which loosened
federal controls over methadone, changing its status from that of
an investigational new drug to a new drug requiring ongoing,
long-term study </font><font size="1">.39 </font><font size="2">By
October 1973, nearly <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">eighty thousand persons were enrolled in
methadone maintenance programs </font><font size="1">.40 </font><font
size="2">Some of these programs were federally funded; all
operated with federal government approval.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">From the government's perspective, methadone
treatment programs had certain advantages over therapeutic
community programs. Methadone allowed greater numbers of people
to be treated in fewer programs, thus making rapid program
expansion easier. For a large number of heroin addicts unable to
successfully remain drug-free, the expansion of methadone
programs offered an invaluable alternative to heroin addiction.
Moreover, the cost per client of methadone maintenance was
substantially less than the cost in a therapeutic community. And
although methadone treatment could not meet the public's demand
for drug abstinence, it could satisfy the even more popular
demand for a reduction in heroin-related crime. Finally,
methadone programs staffed with medical doctors and operated in
more traditional medical clinical style could be more easily
understood by the public. The encounter sessions and heavy
psychological orientation of the therapeutic community were often
misunderstood, even though the drug-free orientation was
commended. Thus, the expansion of heroin treatment
programs-particularly using methadone treatment-became SAODAP's
first objective.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <b><font size="2">International Activities. </font></b><font
size="2">In his June 1971 message to Congress, President Nixon
had proposed an all-out global war on international drug
trafficking. To dramatize his intentions, Nixon called together
the U.S ambassadors to Turkey, France, Mexico, Luxembourg,
Thailand, the Republic of Vietnam, and the United Nations to
discuss ways to encourage greater cooperation from other nations
in the effort to control the illegal growing and trafficking of
opium worldwide. &quot;I sought to make it . . . clear,&quot; he
told Congress of this meeting, &quot;that I consider the heroin
addiction of American citizens an international problem of grave
concern to this Nation, and I instructed our Ambassadors to make
this clear to their liost governments. We want good relations
with othe@r countries, but we cannot buy good relations at the
expense of temporizing on this prob-</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">lem </font><font size="1">. -41</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Two weeks later President Nixon formally
announced that the Government of Turkey had agreed to impose a
total ban on opium poppy cultivation following the 1972 harvest.
In return the United States pledged $35.7 million in aid over a
five-year period to compensate Turkey for the projected financial
loss on legitimate sales of opium, and to help Turkish farmers
develop substitute crops offering new sources of income. The
agreement was hailed as a &quot;most significant
breakthrough&quot; even though the ban was not to take effect
until a year after its announcement </font><font size="1">.42 </font><font
size="2">The Turkish agreement was intended to help launch a
concentrated American<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">effort to halt all illicit opium production
throughout the world. During the following twelve months,
however, that effort far surpassed any tangible results.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In September 1971 President Nixon established
a new Cabinet Committee on International Narcotics Control, to
oversee the further development of U.S. international drug
control efforts. The Cabinet Committee, chaired by the Secretary
of State, directed the U.S. embassies in fifty-nine countries to
prepare Narcotics Control Action Plans to be used as a basis for
negotiating bilateral agreements with foreign countries in
furtherance of U.S. international drug control programs.
Apparently, however, it was decided that other countries were not
to be offered the same type of broad-based economic assistance
which had been extended to Turkey. Rather, the Narcotics Control
Action Plans were to be more limited in scope, essentially
offering law enforcement assistance to improve the
&quot;intelligence capability and law enforcement capacity of the
host </font><font size="1">. `43 </font><font size="2">Furthermore,
whereas Turkey had been offered the &quot;carrot,&quot; other
nations were threatened with the &quot;stick&quot; of, among
other things, termination of economic and military assistance </font><font
size="1">.44 </font><font size="2">This change in strategy
suggests that the administration was aware, even before the
Turkish ban took effect, of the severe limitations of this
approach. There simply were too many countries where opium could
be grown and converted to heroin for sale in the lucrative U.S.
market </font><font size="1">.45 </font><font size="2">It would
have been difficult to negotiate similar agreements with all
other potential &quot;source&quot; countries, and even if
diplomatically possible the cost would have been prohibitive.
Moreover, because of the remoteness of many areas from their
governments, not every country could successfully impose an opium
ban even if it agreed to try. Gradually, therefore, international
interdiction efforts replaced prevention of opium cultivation as
the major objective of the U.S. international drug control
effort.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Thus, despite active presidential involvement,
no dramatic bilateral agreements other than that with Turkey and
the aforementioned one with France were produced to show success
on the international front.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In addition to bilateral efforts, efforts were
also made to strengthen the enforcement provisions of the 1961
Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the governing international
agreement on illicit drug control. In 1971 the United States
submitted proposed amendments to the Single Convention which were
largely directed toward improving controls on illicit opium
cultivation in source countries. These amendments were formally
agreed upon at a plenipotentiary conference in 1972 and submitted
to the signatory countries for their ratification. The Nixon
administration apparently regarded the amendments as a bold new
approach in international narcotics control, despite the
ineffectiveness of the basic treaty </font><font size="1">.41,</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">In return for strengthening the 1961 Single
Convention, the opium growing countries pressured the United
States to support a second international agreement which would
for the first time place multinational controls on synthetic,
&quot;psychotropic&quot; drugs such as hallucinogens,
amphetamines, barbiturates, and tranquilizers. This treaty, also
drafted in 1971, became known as the Psychotropic Convention.47
The opium-producing countries viewed its ratification as a
demonstration of the industrialized nations' seriousness about
controlling the spread of nonnarcotic drug misuse. American
support of the Psychotropic Convention thus became a necessary
quid pro quo for support from the opium-producing nations on
strengthening the Single Convention.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">President Nixon sent the Psychotropic
Convention to the Senate for approval on June 29, 1971. The
proposed treaty met strong opposition because it threatened to
limit domestic flexibility in regulating various psychoactive
drugs. It was argued that the treaty would further remove the
medical and scientific professions from decision-making
responsibilities in U.S. domestic drug policy. To date neither
the Psychotropic Convention nor the changes in domestic law that
it would have required have been passed.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <b><font size="2">Domestic Drug Law Enforcement. </font></b><font
size="2">Until 1970 BNDD and its principal predecessor, the
Federal Bureau of Narcotics, were often accused of concentrating
too much law enforcement effort on users and street dealers in
order to inflate the number of arrests made. In 1970 BNDD claimed
this policy had been reversed, with efforts being redirected to
the higher levels of the illicit drug distribution structure.
BNDD director John Ingersoll explained the anticipated result of
this change to a House Appropriations subcommittee in March 1970.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">The shift in emphasis of federal narcotic and
dangerous drug law enforcement from the addict, abuser, and
small-time street peddler to the <b>im</b>portant illicit
traffickers and illegal supply sources will undoubtedly result in
fewer total arrests. But those made should have a greater impact
on the supply of narcotics and drugs available for distribution
to the consumers in this country than a larger number of less
significant arrests. 48</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">However, in 1971 the administration sought to
increase the number of arrests by getting BNDD to move once again
against street-level dealers.49 The administration apparently
believed that this would suggest a more active and successful
&quot;offensive&quot; in its &quot;war&quot; on illicit drugs and
drug users. BNDD resisted the change, contending that such
efforts should be carried out by state and local agencies, and it
continued to go after the higher levels of the drug distribution
systems. Like NIMH, BNDD was not immediately responsive to the
administration's wishes. And so once again the White House
created a new agency under direct White House control. In January
1972 the Office of Drug Abuse Law Enforcement (ODALE) was created
by executive order within the justice Department.50 ODALE was
made &quot;responsible for the development and implementation of
a concentrated program throughout the federal government for the
enforcement of federal laws relating to the prevention of drug
abuse and for cooperation with state and local governments in the
enforcement of their<b> </b>drug abuse laws </font><font size="1">.&quot;51
</font><font size="2">The director of ODALE was also made a
special consultant to the president for drug-abuse law
enforcement, thus becoming the nation's chief drug law
enforcement spokesman.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Within a month after its establishment, ODALE
had selected thirty three target cities and had deployed strike
forces consisting of federal investigators and agents, assistant
U.S. attorneys, and state and local police officers. These strike
forces concentrated on the lower and middle levels of the
domestic heroin distribution systems, and, according to one
observer, -were instructed -to &quot;make arrests by any lawful
means possible, even if it meant bypassing the normal channels. </font><font
size="1">`52 </font><font size="2">By combining the<b> </b>specialized
enforcement authorities and powers of various federal agencies
e.g., the Internal Revenue Service, Customs, BNDD, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Alcohol, Tobacco, and
Firearms Agency, etc. -ODALE was in a unique position to
&quot;bypass normal channels.&quot; The strike forces were
sufficiently funded to be able to make extensive use of
undercover agents and &quot;buy money&quot; to purchase drugs and
pay infofmants; investigative grand juries were empaneled; and
ODALE was empowered to use court-authorized wiretaps and
&quot;no-knock&quot; warrants in making arrests. As expected, the
number of arrests rose quickly and the increased figures were
publicized. Rapidly and dramatically, ODALE became a prominent,
highly visible part of the administration's &quot;war on
drugs.&quot;<br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <b>The Congressional Response: Passage of the Drug Abuse
Office and Treatment Act of 1972<br>
</b> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Congress responded to President Nixon's
challenge for quick and decisive action by passing the Drug Abuse
Office and Treatment Act of 1972 (P. L. 92-255), just nine months
after his June 1971 message and a year in advance of the
scheduled completion of the second report of the National
Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse </font><font size="1">.51 </font><font
size="2">This new legislation reorganized a major part of the
federal drug effort, effected important changes in the roles of
state and local government in the planning and funding of drug
treatment services, and expanded the overall size of the federal
drug effort by voting higher budget authorizations. Compared with
most major legislation, action on this bill was quick and
thorough: Two Senate committees and one House committee held
hearings on the proposed legislation; after the Senate and House
passed differing versions, a Conference<b> </b>Committee ironed
out the differences, and then both bodies passed the compromise
legislation by unanimous votes.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The final wording of the Drug Abuse Office and
Treatment Act showed Congress and the president to be in general
agreement on the best organizational arrangements for effectively
coordinating the federal drug effort. The basic
&quot;supply&quot; and &quot;demand&quot; approach was adopted,
and SAODAP was established to coordinate and oversee the
development of federal drug-abuse prevention activities,* the
&quot;demand&quot; side of the equation. Congress acceded to the
president's request that SAODAP be made a part of the executive
office of the president. Since at this time the question of the
limits of executive authority was uppermost in the minds of many
legislators, this was generally interpreted as a strong
affirmation of congressional intent to deal decisively with the
drug issue. Congress agreed with the president that SAODAP need
be only a temporary agency, and established June 30, 1975 as the
date by which SAODAP -would be -replaced by a new National
Institute on Drug Abuse, operating within the traditional
channels of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">SAODAP's primary responsibilities were to
reorganize and direct the federal programs in drug treatment,
rehabilitation, education, prevention, training, and research.
Moreover, SAODAP would be responsible for coordinating these
&quot;demand&quot; efforts with the federal drug law enforcement
programs, though the agency would have no authority over the
latter. SAODAP's position was a difficult one: Congress and the
president expected it to coordinate, &quot;from outside and
above,&quot; the activities of fourteen agencies that until then
had existed in relative autonomy; to attain its goal in a short
period of time; and to coordinate these activities in a field
where there was considerable disagreement as to the most
effective means of dealing with the problems.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">*The legislation used the term &quot;drug
abuse prevention&quot; to refer to all non-law-enforcement drug
efforts including treatment and rehabilitation; education,
prevention, and training; and research. <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">To help the new agency accomplish these
formidable tasks, Congress included in the legislation several
provisions designed to insure a coordinated federal drug effort. </font><font
size="1">54 </font><font size="2">First, it established SAODAP as
a kind of mini-Office of Management and Budget, though limited to
the drug abuse prevention programs of the various federal
agencies. -SAODAP was empowered to reprogram an agency's
drug-abuse prevention funds if necessary to insure greater
conformity with the overall policies and priorities it would set.
Second, Congress established a special fund of $40 million for
SAODAP for each of three fiscal years &quot;to provide additional
incentives to Federal departments and agencies to develop more
effective drug abuse prevention functions and to give the
Director [of SAODAP] the flexibility to encourage, and respond
quickly and efficiently to, the development of promising programs
and approaches.&quot; Although Congress stipulated that at least
90 percent of these funds had to be spent by federal agencies
other than SAODAP, they had to be spent according to SAODAP
directives. Third, SAODAP received the power of &quot;management
oversight review.&quot; This -power, although never actually
exercised, gave it the authority to assume the drug-abuse
prevention functions of an uncooperative federal agency for up to
thirty days. The explicit legislative granting of such power is
very rare; the potential authority is usually enough to persuade
any recalcitrants of the advantages of cooperation.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Although the purpose of this reorganization
was to streamline, coordinate, and make more efficient the
federal response, it also effectively muted opposition. In fact,
when he signed the legislation enacting SAODAP, President Nixon
warned that &quot;heads will roll&quot; if the agency directors
did not cooperate with the new office.51 The president named Dr.
Jaffe -to direct SAODAP and expand the work he had already begun
under executive order. When SAODAP formally began in March 1972,
policy and programmatic decisions had essentially been made; it
was simply a matter of carrying them out. What reservations there
were within and without government were largely ignored or
overridden. Recommendations such as those put forth by the
National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse in 1972 and 1973
were quickly rejected because they were inconsistent with the
policies and programs the administration had already chosen to
pursue.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In sum, up<b> </b>to and through the 1972
presidential elections the Nixon administration sought to be <i>(1)
responsive </i>to the public concern about heroin addiction and
heroin-related crime, (2) <i>effective, </i>in contrast to the
lack of success which had characterized past drug efforts, and
(3) <i>quick, </i>so that &quot;progress&quot; could be claimed
at the earliest possible moment. Most of the bureaucratic
restraints which might have impeded the Nixon administration's
&quot;war on drugs&quot; had been overcome, so its potential to
&quot;solve the drug problem&quot; could be tested.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <b><font size="2">Deemphasis of the Drug Issue and Emergence
of the National Institute on Drug Abuse </font></b><font size="2">(NI15A)
<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Eighteen months after the enactment of the
Drug Abuse Office and Treatment Act, and only ten months after
his reelection, President Nixon signaled a change in direction by
announcing in September 1973, &quot;We have turned the corner on
drug addiction in the United States.&quot;511 Although caveats
followed this declaration, the announcement was an important
milestone in the history of the government's response to illicit
drugs. In addition to being a statement of &quot;victory,&quot;
the president's message also implied disengagement from the war.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">In the days and weeks following this
announcement, administration officials offered evidence in
support of the President's statement </font><font size="1">.57 </font><font
size="2">This &quot;evidence&quot; included claims of an apparent
shortage of heroin on the East Coast, an increase in the street
price of the drug, an increase in the number of drug seizures and
arrests, the expansion of drug treatment availability and
utilization, a reported decline in the incidence of new heroin
use, and heroin-related crime being down. Not everyone agreed:
Some challenged the accuracy of the statistics, others challenged
their interpretation. Still others accepted the evidence, but
cautioned that the downward trend might only be temporary.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">In retrospect, it is clear that the &quot;turn
the corner&quot; speech was based on more than statistics. Other
factors were also at work, and a brief review of certain events
which occurred between June 1971 and September 1973 will help to
explain the turnabout.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">First, the 1972 presidential election had
passed. Though it is difficult to assess what part this may have
played in the administration's response to the drug issue, there
is little doubt that it had some importance. Illicit drugs were a
major political issue, and anyone running for national elective
office was expected to address it.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Second, the armies of addicted Vietnam
soldiers never materialized. The severity of the problem had been
overestimated; among those soldiers who did use opium or heroin
in Vietnam, subsequent research showed that relatively few were
either dysfunctional or addicted users after their return to the
United States </font><font size="1">.58</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Third, public interest in the drug issued
waned. There were a host of possible explanations for this: The
problems had been overdrarnatized and public fears exaggerated,
the rate of urban crime had leveled off, other domestic issues
had taken precedence, the media had run out of things to say, or
it was simply part of the natural ebb and flow of public
interest. Whatever the reasons, there is little question that the
public's attention had become diverted elsewhere.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Fourth, the new avenues of response to the use
of illicit drugs, which had been pursued with varying degrees of
success, had in their combined effect failed to measure up to
original expectations, and it seemed unlikely that any further
improvement would result from a widened or intensified effort in
these areas.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">For example, federal law enforcement efforts
against street-level drug activities had backfired. ODALE was not
always well received by local law enforcement agencies, and its
ability to have a significant impact on street-level drug
activities was seriously questioned.59 In April 1973, ODALE
agents were involved in two criticized &quot;no-knock&quot;
entries into homes in Collinsville, Illinois. The events in
Collinsville precipitated a thorough review of the agency and a
reevaluation of the need for unique enforcement authorities
against drug dealers and users. In effect, ODALE had gone too far
in &quot;bypassing the normal channels.&quot; Instead of becoming
a positive symbol of how to win a war on drugs, ODALE became the
focal point of criticisms about the excesses of that war. On June
30, 1973, ODALE was abolished in yet another drug-law-enforcement
agency reorganizations The position of special consultant to the
president for drug-abuse law enforcement matters was also
abolished, and Congress subsequently repealed the no-knock and
preventive detention sections of the federal statutes. Federal
law enforcement strategy reverted to a concentration on the upper
levels of drug distribution systems.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The Turkish opium ban did contribute to a
shortage of heroin in 1973, principally in the eastern United
States. But because the government had been unable to negotiate
any other significant bilateral agreements, it became clear that
the Turkish ban would have only a temporary effect. The period
immediately after the Turkish ban took effect was the high point
in terms of any practical significance which it could have had.
The demand for heroin and the consequent profits to be realized
were bound to generate new supplies and supply routes-it was only
a matter of time. Bilateral agreements thus failed to provide any
lasting &quot;solution.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Drug treatment programs, methadone programs in
particular, had been expanded to a point where everyone
voluntarily seeking treatment could get it. Overall, the quality
of the treatment offered in methadone as well as drug-free
programs improved. Program personnel gained experience and with
it increasing expertise. Increased funding assured greater
program stability. However, treatment supply exceeded treatment
demand; in this crucial respect the administration's goal had
been reached: Unless more people were to enter treatment, the
maximum short-term impact of this approach had also probably been
reached.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The administration, through SAODAP, had also
achieved a more coordinated federal effort on the
&quot;demand&quot; side. Much overlapping, duplication, and
inefficiency had been eliminated. Within the framework of its
policies and programs, the federal response was functioning much
more smoothly.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">And the budget was sufficient; the total FY 74
drug budget was $760 million. Lack of funds no longer limited the
potential of the federal drug response; at the same time there
was no indication that increasing the budget further would
measurably improve the situation.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">There seemed little need to any longer
maintain a strong White House identification with the drug issue.
Within the framework of the policies and programs the
administration had chosen to pursue the situation was probably as
good as it would get in the foreseeable future. Politically, this
may have suggested to the federal government that the issue could
be returned to a more &quot;normal&quot; status within the
bureaucracy and be dealt with like most other urban and social
problems.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Whether or not the president's assessment of
the situation in his &quot;turn the corner&quot; speech was
correct, it triggered a turn in government activity in the drug
field. The more extraordinary measures of the previous years
could no longer be justified, On the contrary, it became
necessary for government budget- and policymakers to make major
changes in the federal drug effort in order to prove that a
victory had been won. Even before the president's pronouncement,
drug law enforcement programs had been moved away from active
White House involvement to a newly formed Drug Enforcement
Administration within the Department of justice. Federal efforts
against street-level drug dealers and users were quietly
abandoned. International efforts to curtail illicit drug
cultivation and trafficking continued, but were less publicized.
SAODAP remained in existence until June 30, 1975, but it lost its
influence after the &quot;turn the corner&quot; speech. The trend
in budget requests was also reversed: The overall treatment and
rehabilitation budget for FY 75 (proposed in January 1974) was
$33 million less than in the previous fiscal year, marking the
first drug budget cutback in the Nixon administrations
Furthermore, the administration sought increasingly to shift drug
programming responsibilities to the states, under the aegis of
its &quot;new federalism&quot; policies.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The combined effect of these actions was
significantly to reduce the visibility and controversy of the
federal drug effort. This was beneficial in the sense that the
drug issue was temporarily freed from the political rhetoric that
had bound it. But the loss of momentum was unfortunate to the
extent that the government's opportunity to shape a more
comprehensive approach to drug problems in America was not
decisively acted upon.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">One of the most important and lasting
byproducts of this chain of events was the creation of a new
agency, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) within HEW.
This was created by a departmental reorganization announced by
the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare on September 23,
1973. The announcement occurred more than a year in advance of
the congressional requirement in the Drug Abuse Office and
Treatment Act of 1972 for the creation of such an agency no later
than December 30, 1974 </font><font size="1">.113</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Organizationally, NIDA was made a fourth-level
agency in HEW. As Figure 1.3 illustrates, the director of NIDA is
one of three agency directors reporting to the administrator of
the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental. Health Administration
(ADAMHA). The administrator of ADAMHA is, in turn, one of six
Public Health Service officials reporting to the assistant
secretary for health, who in turn is one of many assistant
secretaries reporting to the secretary of HEW.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Despite this organizational arrangement, NIDA
was charged with providing &quot;leadership, policies and goals
for the Federal effort in the prevention, control and treatment
of narcotic addiction and drug abuse, and the rehabilitation of
affected individuals.&quot; Clearly, NIDA was intended to succeed
SAODAP as the lead agency on the &quot;demand&quot; side of the
federal drug effort.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">But NIDA was not and could not be a substitute
for SAODAP. SAODAP was designed to be a policy and coordinating
office, with minimal direct program responsibilities. NIDA was
given the bulk of drug treatment program responsibilities but
very limited coordinating powers. Much of SAODAP's authority was
contained in P. L. 92-255, and most of those powers were not
transferable to NIDA without congressional approval. Even if the
powers were to be transferred, the decisions and directions taken
by NIDA, buried as it was within HEW, would obviously have
attracted less attention and carried less weight than when the
very same actions were announced by a White House office.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Although the earlier-than-anticipated
emergence of NIDA and diminution of SAODAP made many of those
involved with drug treatment and prevention anxious about the
future, some found solace in the fact that the drug treatment and
prevention effort had been removed from the immediate control of
NIMH. Under the HEW reorganization NIDA was established as
separate and equal to NIMH. Similarly, responsibility in the
alcoholism field had been removed from NIMH and given to another
new separate and equal agency, the National Institute on Alcohol
Abuse and Alcoholism. The effect of removing NIMH control from
these fields was to allow each to more fully develop its own
approaches. Inasmuch as drug problems in many respects lie
outside traditional mental health concerns, the creation of NIDA
independent of NIMH was applauded by many people in the drug
treatment and prevention fields.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <img src="fada1003.gif"><font size="2"> <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <b>The Arguments for and against the Continuation of SAODAP<br>
</b> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Even though NIDA was in full operation by
mid-1974, SAODAP continued to function until its expiration date
of June 30, 1975, though with greatly reduced staff levels and
diminished bureaucratic status. It was maintained to exercise
those coordinating functions which could not legally be
transferred to NIDA. Moreover, it provided the drug treatment and
prevention fields with a symbolic organizational parity with drug
law enforcement concerns, a role which NIDA could not fulfill.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">By early 1975, questions were being raised
about the implications of SAODAP's impending demise. The future
direction and scope of the federal drug effort seemed uncertain.
Gerald Ford had succeeded Richard Nixon as president, and Ford's
views and commitment regarding the drug field were largely
unknown.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In March 1975, Senator William Hathaway,
chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Alcoholism and Narcotics,
introduced legislation amending the Drug Abuse Office and
Treatment Act of 1972. The proposed legislation called for a
modified version of SAODAP, to be called the Office of Drug Abuse
Prevention Policy (ODAPP), which would continue certain
policymaking and coordinating functions of the predecessor
agency. The expiration of SAODAP along with other provisions of
P. L. 92255-including funding authorizations for future federal
treatment, prevention, and research efforts-gave Congress its
first opportunity to review both the 1972 legislation and the
status of the federal response.114</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">This congressional review prompted President
Ford to direct the Domestic Council to undertake its own
assessment in order to define more clearly the administration's
drug policies and prepare the administration's response to any
congressional action </font><font size="1">.6' </font><font
size="2">These congressional and executive office assessments
reconsidered the tone and approach of the government's response
to illicit drug use in a distinctively less politicized way than
had marked the crisis atmosphere during the Nixon administration.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Both Congress and the administration sought to
back away from the warlike rhetoric of the Nixon administration.
The emphasis on &quot;victories&quot; and &quot;solutions&quot;
was replaced by more cautious statements about &quot;goals&quot;
and &quot;objectives.&quot; Congress amended its Declaration of
National Policy by adopting more temperate wording. The Domestic
Council Report to the president was even more straightforward
with respect to its assessment of goals:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">We should stop raising unrealistic
expectations of total elimination of drug abuse from our society.
At the same time, we should in no way signal tacit acceptance of
drug abuse or a lessened commitment to continue aggressive
efforts aimed at eliminating it entirely. The sobering fact is
that some members of any society will seek escape from the
stresses of life </font><font size="1">through drug use.
Prevention, education, treatment, and rehabilitation will curtail
their number, but will not eliminate drug use entirely. As long
as there is demand, criminal drug traffickers will make some
supply available, provided that the potential profits outweigh
the risks of detection and punishment. Vigorous supply reduction
efforts will reduce, but not eliminate, supply. And reduction in
the supply of one drug may only cause abuse prone individuals to
turn to another substance.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">All of this indicates that, regrettably, we
will probably always have a drug problem of some proportion.
Therefore we must be prepared to continue our efforts and our
commitment indefinitely, in order to contain the problem at a
minimal level, and in order to minimize the adverse social costs
of drug abuse.&quot;&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">This acknowledgment of the persistence of drug
problems and the impossibility of achieving a quick victory had
no direct effect on the operational aspects of the various drug
programming efforts; it only sought to adjust public expectations
of them.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">Congress and the Ford administration relieved
some of the anxieties felt in the drug treatment field after the
&quot;turn the corner&quot; speech by halting the one-year budget
cutback which had been initiated with that speech. Although
questions were raised about the adequacy of the administration's
budget proposal, many agencies and individuals were pleased
-simply by this temporizing action.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">More serious difficulties between Congress and
the president arose over whether some modified version of SAODAP
should be continued. Many in Congress argued for such an agency;
President Ford and his administration were opposed to it. The
proponents of a successor agency to SAODAP contended that White
House coordination of the drug effort was still necessary <b>.7 </b>They
held that without some successor to SAODAP the earlier
organizational Difficulties could easily reappear, maintaining
that the logic which dictated congressional approval of SAODAP in
1972 extended to the proposed Office of Drug Abuse Prevention
Policy in 1975. Congressional proponents further argued that
NIDA, as a fourth-level HEW agency, would never be able to
exercise any real control over the &quot;demand&quot; side of the
federal drug effort. They pointed cut that 51 percent of all
federal expenditures for drug prevention programs were made by
agencies other than NIDA, and thus concluded that &quot;for NIDA
to coordinate and lead the Federal drug abuse prevention effort,
both from a structural and from a fiscal perspective, would be
difficult at best and, more likely, actually
impossible.&quot;&quot;&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">President Ford and the Domestic Council Task
Force agreed on the need for continued coordination, but they
differed with the proponents of ODAPP on the way to achieve it.
Rather than have a special White House agency just to coordinate
the &quot;demand&quot; side of the federal drug effort, President
Ford opted for &quot;strong Cabinet management&quot; of the
program. </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In April 1976 he created the Cabinet Committee
for Drug Abuse Prevention (CCDAP), chaired by the Secretary of
HEW, which included the Secretaries of Defense and Labor and the
administrator of the Veterans Administration. CCDAF was given
responsibility for the oversight and coordination of all federal
activities involving drug prevention, treatment, and
rehabilitation, integrating the efforts of all the cabinet
departments and agencies involved. Moreover, CCDAP was expected
to &quot;give HEW, ADAMHA, and NIDA the organizational strength
and authority to provide the interdepartmental and interagency
coordination needed to maintain the progress which has been made
in drug abuse treatment and prevention. &quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">ODAPP's sponsors sought to extend its
projected responsibilities of review, -formulation, and
coordination of drug policies and priorities to all drug policies
and programs, including drug law enforcement programs and
international negotiations. This was to be the major difference
between ODAPP and SAODAP, whose authority had been confined to
drug treatment, rehabilitation, education, prevention, and
research. This proposed extension of authority for ODAPP gained
support for several reasons: First, it sought to reconceptualize
the federal drug effort by bridging the gap between the
enforcement and treatment approaches. ODAPP was envisioned as the
forum in government by which the long-standing philosophical
conflicts between the medical and law enforcement communities
could be faced and, ideally, reconciled.70 At the very least,
ODAPP was being designed to insure a more comprehensive review of
the drug programs and policies of the various federal agencies.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Second, this extension of ODAPP's authority
was proposed at a time when the balance between drug law
enforcement and drug treatment and prevention programs was once
again shifting in favor of law enforcement.71 The drug law
enforcement budget was rising while drug treatment and prevention
funds remained level; and, bureaucratically, DEA was a higher
level agency within the justice Department than was NIDA in HEW.
ODAPP was supported partly in the hope that it could keep a
balance between these two principal agencies and their respective
approaches to the drug problem.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Third, support for ODAPP stemmed from the
congressional desire to have one single administration official
with overall responsibility for national drug policy who would be
accountable to Congress. At the time Congress was considering
ODAPP, officials of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
were refusing to testify before Congress on drug policy issues,
and the directors of the various drug agencies (NIDA and DEA in
particular) spoke only for their own programs and policies. The
unresolved areas, as well as the overall concerns, of national
policy could easily be unintentionally overlooked in this
situation. ODAPP was designed to rectify this.72<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">President Ford and the Domestic Council Task
Force also recognized the need to coordinate treatment and
enforcement approaches. In its report the Domestic Council
stated, &quot;Strong coordinative mechanisms are necessary to
ensure that the efforts of these [Federal] departments and
agencies are integrated into an effective overall program, and
that the approach adopted in each is consistent with the
President's priorities.&quot;&quot; However, the administration
maintained that such coordination could be attained without a
White House agency. Instead, it chose to formalize the division
of the drug functions developed during the Nixon administration.
Thus the government's response split the effort into three
separate areas, each with a &quot;lead agency </font><font
size="1">. '174 </font><font size="2">The Drug Enforcement
Administration was designated as the &quot;lead agency&quot; for
drug law enforcement, the State Department for international
activities, and NIDA for prevention and treatment. To strengthen
interagency coordination within each functional area, President
Ford convened three separate cabinet committees, each with
oversight and coordination responsibilities within one area.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Going a step further in acknowledging some
need for &quot;program oversight and limited interagency
coordination at the Executive Office level </font><font size="1">&quot;75
</font><font size="2">President Ford and the Domestic Council
accordingly made several more recommendations.76 Foremost among
them was the recommendation that the Strategy Council on Drug
Abuse* be revitalized to provide overall policy guidance, and
that a small staff at OMB be maintained to assist the Strategy
Council and executive office in formulating drug policy. However,
these recommendations fell considerably short of a White House
Office for drug abuse.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">*The Strategy Council, mandated in 1972 by
P.L. 92-255, consists of government officials and private
citizens appointed by the president.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The argument that Congress needed one person
or office to be accountable to it for total federal drug policy
was rejected by the administration. &quot;The best places to get
such information and to seek accountability for progress,&quot;
said President Ford, &quot;are the departments and agencies which
have direct responsibility and program authority.&quot;</font><font
size="1">77</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In point of fact, the arguments raised both
for and against ODAPP were illusory. There were other ways to
satisfy the needs cited by the proponents of ODAPP, and the
creation of ODAPP would not have guaranteed the advantages
envisioned anyway. For example, the Ford administration could
have coordinated its response to the drug problems of America
without an ODAPP, just as it could have allowed the partitions
between the medical and legal approaches to continue despite
ODAPP's presence.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The ODAPP concept was <i>strongly </i>supported
by the majority of individuals, associations, and private
organizations working in the drug treatment, rehabilitation,
education, prevention, and research fields. All had felt
seriously threatened by the funding cutbacks of the Nixon
administration's last budget, and the elimination of SAODAP had
added to the uncertainty about future federal commitment.
Accordingly, these associations and organizations, many of which
had developed during the years of budget expansion, vigorously
lobbied Congress to support the small White House agency for
drugs as a sign of their support for the drug field.
Congressional spokesmen took note of the symbolic importance of
ODAPP, explaining that &quot;there is a clear danger that
elimination of that office [SAODAP or ODAPP] would have enormous
symbolic significance to this field. There is no way in which
this move [the elimination of SAODAP], coupled with recent
proposals to cut funds, can appear to be anything but a drastic
retrenchment in Federal priorities </font><font size="1">.&quot;711</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">The Ford administration's opposition to ODAPP
was also symbolic, but not in relation to the drug field.
President Ford had committed himself to a reduction of executive
office power and a restoration of the powers of the various
cabinet departments and federal agencies. He wished to reverse
the concentration of power in the White House which had
characterized the Nixon administrations trend to which SAODAP was
both a symbolic and a real contributor. To the Ford
administration, the negative symbolism of a new White House drug
office-even a small one-overrode any positive symbolism it might
have conveyed to the drug field.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In March 1976, eight months after SAODAP had
expired, Congress passed legislation creating in the White House
the Office of Drug Abuse Policy (ODAP, a slight shortening of the
originally proposed name) </font><font size="1">.71, </font><font
size="2">Compared to SAODAP, ODAP was organizationally small and
its legislatively granted powers limited, but its coordinating
responsibilities extended to law enforcement and international
negotiations, thus giving it broader scope than its predecessor.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">President Ford signed the legislation creating
ODAP only because sections of the same bill contained the
necessary funding authorizations to continue federal efforts in
drug treatment and prevention. The president remained steadfastly
opposed to ODAP in principle, and in signing the legislation he
said:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">I have voiced strong opposition to the
reestablishment of a special office for drug abuse in the White
House. I believe that such an office would be duplicative and
unnecessary and that it would detract from strong Cabinet
management of the Federal drug abuse program. Therefore, while I
am signing this bill because of the need for Federal funds for
drug abuse prevention and treatment, I do not intend to seek
appropriations for the new Office of Drug Abuse Policy created by
the bill. 110 </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">This impasse continued throughout Ford's
presidency; ODAP had been legally constituted but remained a
&quot;paper&quot; agency with neither staff nor funds. Instead,
President Ford continued his plan for supervision of government
response to illicit drug use through three cabinet committees,
one each for law enforcement, international narcotics control,
and treatment and prevention. <br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <b><font size="2">Government Response under Presidents Ford
and Carter<br>
</font></b> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Drug problems and issues faded from the
limelight during the Ford administration, a change generally
viewed as salutary when compared to the tumultuous years
preceding it. Funding levels in all areas remained reasonably
stable, as did program operations. Although whatever gains had
resulted from the Turkish opium ban were reversed by the new
availability of Mexican heroin, no new &quot;wars&quot; were
proclaimed. Utilization of existing treatment capacity did
increase throughout the country and funding was increased to
treat several thousand more people. The Drug Enforcement
Administration continued to confiscate large amounts of illicit
drugs, but the overall impact on illicit trafficking was
marginal.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Guided by the Domestic Council's &quot;White
Paper on Drug Abuse,&quot; the Ford administration accepted the
verdict that the &quot;drug problem&quot; could not be
eliminated. Instead of trying to rally public support to end
&quot;drug abuse,&quot; the administration started seeking to
develop greater public tolerance of this ineradicable phenomenon.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Although the style was different and the goals
less ambitious, the Ford administration's response to illicit
drugs was largely predicated on the same assumptions about the
innate harmfulness of illicit drugs that have guided the
government's response to drugs throughout the twentieth century.
The administration's response continued to rest upon law
enforcement or quasi-enforcement strategies fundamentally
intended to prohibit new or continued use of nonapproved
psychoactive substances. Though these assumptions were not
challenged, the limits of any attempt to &quot;solve&quot; the
problems of illicit drug use were at last openly acknowl-edged-a
significant change from previous administrations.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In his one major public statement on the use
of illicit drugs, President Ford devoted less than three
paragraphs to treatment and prevention issues. The remainder of
his six-page message to Congress&quot; addressed the drug-crime
nexus, law enforcement efforts, proposals for mandatory minimum
sentences for traffickers and bail denial, the activities of
Customs, use of the Internal Revenue Service to go after
traffickers, international control and cooperation, and the like.
Support for programs in treatment and prevention was derived, as
with enforcement, from the longstanding fears and assumptions
about illicit drugs, their users, and their effects on society.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">When Jimmy Carter became president some
observers of the drug field expected swift and significant policy
and programmatic changes to result, in part because of Carter's
close association with Dr. Peter Bourne, a highly regarded drug
program expert. In March 1977, under some pressure from Congress,
President Carter activated ODAP, naming Dr. Bourne as its
director. It was believed that ODAP might devise a more unified
and coordinated government response to illicit drugs, melding the
goals and concerns of the treatment, prevention, and enforcement
communities.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">No sooner had ODAP been activated, however,
than President Carter announced his intention of abolishing the
office. This announcement was made as part of the Reorganization
Plan No. 1 of 1977, in which President Carter sought to
streamline and reduce the White House staff. As a result, ODAP
expired in April 1978, after completing a series of drug policy
studies spanning the treatment, prevention, and enforcement
fields. </font><font size="1">82 </font><font size="2">ODAP's
legal functions were transferred to the president. Dr. Bourne
remained as special assistant to the president in part to
&quot;advise the President on drug policy and assist in the
coordination of interagency efforts,&quot; until his resignation
in July 1978. Several ODAP staff members were transferred to the
Domestic Policy Staff, where they continue to provide some
overall review of drug policy issues. The results of this
reorganization resemble the plan of strong cabinet management
with &quot;some&quot; executive coordination advocated by the
Ford administration.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Shortly after announcing his reorganization
plan, President Carter presented Congress with his first major
message on drug issues.113 His primary concern was the
fragmentation and lack of coordination among drug programs and
agencies. (This organizational problem has persisted in spite of
all the attention it has received.) President Carter stressed the
continuing need for international cooperation, and directed the
individual agencies involved to give the drug issues a high
priority. Like Presidents Nixon and Ford before him, Carter
stressed international law enforcement efforts to eradicate the
illicit cultivation of drugs and interrupt international
trafficking networks. And like his predecessors, he urged
Congress to ratify the Psychotropic Convention.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">With respect to law enforcement, President
Carter announced support for programs which would promise
&quot;swift and severe punishment&quot; to traffickers in drugs.
These programs include the investigation of links between
organized crime and drug trafficking, revocation of passports and
freezing assets of known major traffickers, support of
legislation raising the dollar value of property seized from and
forfeited by a drug violator through administrative action, study
of possible denial of bail or any release prior to trial for
certain major drug-traffic offenders, and the possible emendation
of the Tax Reform Act to allow for easier investigation of major
traffickers (if this would not infringe on the privacy of
citizens). For the most part, these proposals are conceptually
indistinguishable from those made by Presidents Nixon and Ford;
all sought to enact measures that would deter major drug
traffickers in the hope of reducing the availability of illicit
drugs at the street level.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">As for drug treatment, President Carter called
upon NIDA to include more programs for abusers of barbiturates,
amphetamines, and combinations of drugs (including alcohol). He
supported expansion of rehabilitation and job-training programs
for former heroin addicts. President Carter also expressed the
need for better coordination of federally sponsored research
efforts on a variety of drugs, including opiates, alcohol, and
tobacco. He expressed the hope that this would save money and
&quot;lead to greater scientific understanding of addiction
problems.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In recent years the barbiturates have been
recognized as a major drug problem (this problem has resulted in
part from their widespread licit medical use). The special
attention that President Carter directed to be given to these and
other sedative-hypnotic drugs will cover the whole gamut of
federal drug response: Prescribing practices of physicians will
be reviewed, more intensive efforts will be made to prosecute
physicians who deliberately overprescribe, DEA will investigate
street marketing activities and audit companies lawfully
manufacturing the drugs, and HEW will study the question whether
barbiturates should remain on the market. In focusing such
specific attention on barbiturate abuse, President Carter took a
significant step toward extending the federal government's
response to drugs beyond a traditional concern with such illicit
drugs as heroin, cocaine, and marijuana.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">And in what amounted to his most significant
policy break with Presidents Nixon and Ford, Carter endorsed the
decriminalization of possession of small amounts of marijuana for
personal use, noting that &quot;penalties against possession of a
drug should not be more damaging to an individual than the use of
the drug itself.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Nevertheless, the overall thrust of President
Carter's first major statement on drug issues does not suggest
any fundamental changes in the specifics of government response.
The tone does suggest a less emotional approach than that of the
early 1970s; the inclusion of licit drugs which can be
dangerously misused suggests a broader understanding of the
concept of &quot;drug abuse&quot;; and the adoption of a
marijuana decriminalization position suggests that fundamental
changes in government response could occur after current policies
and programs are clearly, repeatedly shown not to work. But in a
broader context President Carter's drug statement further
reflects the tortuously slow process by which public opinion and
public policy change. <br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <b>Some Concluding Thoughts <br>
</b> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The overriding observation which emerges from
a review of the federal government's history of response to
illicit drugs is that its drug policy changes slowly if at all.
Federal drug programs<i> </i>have changed considerably in the
past decade, but policy remains essentially unchanged. Faith
remains strong in the power of criminal sanctions to deter
illicit drug use and the effectiveness of law enforcement efforts
to eliminate that use which does occur.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Two deeply rooted premises have guided federal
response: One is that there are certain drugs which people <i>should
</i>be prohibited from using under any circumstances. The second
is that the government can then prevent their use. The first
premise is philosophical in nature, the second pragmatic.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The philosophical question of the
justification of prohibition can always be argued at great
length; there is no single &quot;answer&quot; as such. With
respect to the pragmatic issue, the belief that government can
prevent illicit drug use, there is more concrete evidence to
analyze. The experience of the 1970s clearly shows that even with
an extensive, generally efficient, and popularly supported
federal effort, it is impossible to prohibit the presence of
nonapproved drugs in American society. It is difficult to
conceive how that effort might have been expanded or intensified
to be more successful while still respecting the traditional
values of a free society.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Federal policymakers are by now generally
cognizant of the limits of current federal drug policy. Why then
do they continue to pursue the same fundamental policies? Because
the public demands it; to relax the prohibitionary goal is
tantamount to being &quot;soft on drugs&quot; (a most pejorative
term that has been used in ugly ways to cast aspersions on those
who question the wisdom of prohibition). In a democratic society,
policymakers cannot stray too far from what the public wants or
they will simply be replaced. Federal drug policy will not change
substantially until there is public support to do so.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">But federal drug officials have not conveyed
to the public an understanding of the limits to their potential
accomplishments; it is far easier politically to highlight
occasionally successful programs and to emphasize long-range
goals or aspirations. Policyrnakers also seem reluctant to engage
the public in a discussion of the philosophy of drug prohibition.
One reason for this difficulty is that for many years the federal
government fueled the popular demand for drug prohibition. Yet
those who are familiar with drug policy recognize now that the
designation of certain drugs as illicit and as targets for
prohibition has roots in racism, hysteria, and sensationalism. It
is also now apparent, based on current knowledge about drugs and
their effects, that prohibition has been based on much
misinformation and misunderstanding.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In the context of these general observations,
the following concluding thoughts are offered:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">1. The most important contribution which
federal drug agencies can now make to future drug policy is to
provide the American public with opportunities to carefully and
sensibly reexamine the wisdom of drug prohibition. Even though
they are now more than five years old, the two reports of the
National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse would still make
an excellent starting point for this reappraisal process.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">2. Until the drug issue becomes less
vulnerable to sensationalism, there is no way to guarantee that
excesses in the federal drug effort, such as those of the early
1970s, can be prevented. Federal drug policies and programs ought
to be the product of careful, thoughtful consideration.
Impulsive, hastily conceived programs such as ODALE can do great
damage to our society.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">3. The federal drug effort needs greater
coordination; the treatment, enforcement, and international
components cannot be left to go -their own -ways. Coordination
without &quot;teeth&quot; has beer, more superficial. than
substantive.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">4. From a policy, bureaucratic, and budgetary
perspective, criminal justice and drug law enforcement agencies
have been too dominant in our national response to the abuse of
psychoactive drugs. This dominance has not served society well;
rather than bringing out the best in us, it has led us to rely
too heavily on our meaner, more punitive instincts.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <b><font size="2">APPENDIX A: A Budget Perspective <br>
</font></b> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Overview of Fiscal Years 1970-1978. It is
impossible to account exactly for all funds expended on the
federal government's response to illicit drugs. The figures
presented in this report are, however, sufficiently accurate to
be used for an overall fiscal analysis and review of significant
trends and priorities. Table 1. 1 presents the federal drug
budget by function for fiscal years 1970-1978.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">From July 1969 through September 1978, the
federal government spent approximately $5.7 billion on its
drug-related efforts. Of this total, $2.4 billion was spent on
treatment and rehabilitation, $2.3 billion on law enforcement,
and the remainder ($.95 billion) was spent on education,
prevention, and training ($.4 billion), research ($.4 billion),
and planning ($.15 billion).</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The effect which the &quot;war on drug
abuse&quot; had on the budget is clearly demonstrable beginning
with FY 72 (which began July 1, 1971, two weeks after President
Nixon's special message to Congress). (See Figure 1.4.) The most
rapid expansion of the federal drug budget occurred during FY 72
and FY 73. After FY 74 and Nixon's &quot;turn the corner&quot;
speech, the rate of budget expansion slowed considerably. (In
fact, if adjusted for inflation, the buying power of the federal
drug effort was lower in FY 78 than it had been since FY 72.)
Still, although the annual rate of growth of the federal drug
budget slowed, the absolute size at which its annual total
more-or-less leveled off was much higher than ever before. The
average annual federal drug expenditure for the years 1974-78 was
over $800 million; for 1973-78-a six-and-one-quarter-year
period-it totaled $5 billion.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Perhaps the most useful index of federal
priorities in the drug area is a comparison of the treatment and
rehabilitation budget with the law enforcement budget. Figure 1.4
displays the rapid growth of the treatment and rehabilitation bud
get between FY 71 and FY 73; however, since FY 73 it has
alternately declined and increased, ending up at nearly the same
level as in FY 73 ($366 million in FY 78 compared to $350 million
in FY 73). The drug law enforcement budget, on the other hand,
has risen steadily, doubling in size from $200 to $400 million in
the same time period. <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <img src="fada1004.gif"><font size="2"> <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">If we look at these items in a slightly
different way-as a percentage of the total federal drug
expenditure for each year-we find a rapid expansion of the
treatment and rehabilitation strategy between FY 71 and FY 73 and
detectable slippage since FY 73 (Figure 1.5). In contrast, the
percentage of the total drug effort allocated to law enforcement
rose from a low of 29 percent in FY 73 to 45 percent, its highest
level, in FY 78.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">This apparent reversal in strategy in the
period FY 71-73-with treatment more heavily funded than
enforcement-is explainable insofar as one accepts the thesis that
drug treatment programs-in particular, methadone treatment
programs-derived at least part of their government support from
concern more with reducing criminal recidivism that with reducing
heroin recidivism. If so, then recent government response to
illicit drug use has remained rather consistently dominated by an
enforcement approach, as indeed it has since the early 1900s.
Moreover, insofar as drug treatment has been funded because of
its crime reduction potential, it may have been in part
ill-defined as &quot;treatment&quot; in a traditional health
context. The pursuit of this avenue of response-crime reduction
through treatment-may offer a reasonable explanation for the
brief reversal during FY 71-73 in the traditional balance between
treatment and enforcement approaches. If so, this adds greater
credence to the contention that the underlying assumptions <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <img src="fada1005.gif"><font size="2"> </font><font size="1">and
strategies of the government's response to illicit drugs has
changed very little in the 1970s.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <b><font size="1">The FY </font></b><font size="1">79 <b>Budget
Request. </b>President Carter released his proposed FY 79 budget
on January 20, 1978. Inasmuch as this budget request is the first
one fully prepared by the Carter administration it is logical to
turn to it for any signs of impending changes in the government
response to drugs. The currently available budget documents
suggest that it will remain essentially unchanged. However, a
complete analysis is precluded because neither OMB'nor ODAP has
compiled drug-related expenditures on an agency-by-agency basis
as they previously did every year since 1971. Without that
compilation it is not possible to add in agency expenditures for
third-party reimbursement, nor is it possible to estimate
accurately either the non-line-item expenditures of federal
agencies or how block grants will be used.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">Thus at this time it is not possible to
include the FY 79 figures in our tables and figures. This absence
of an overall analysis of the drug budget by either OMB or ODAP
could allow a return to a situation where agency drug budgets
dictate overall federal drug policy rather than the other way
around.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <img src="fada1006.gif"><br>
</p>

<p> <font size="1">In the absence of an overall analysis of the
federal drug budget, the budget proposals for NIDA and DEA-the
two principal federal drug agencies-may serve as a useful
surrogate. NIDA's budget will increase to $275.2 million in FY
79, a $13.1 million increase over FY 78. The greater part of this
increase-$11.8 million-is earmarked for research, in response to
the preliminary recommendations of the president's Commission on
Mental Health. NIDA will continue to support a treatment capacity
of 102,000, with a maximum local matching rate of 40 percent; the
treatment budget will remain at $161 million.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">The Drug Enforcement Administration will
receive a modest budgetary increase if President Carter's request
is approved; the DEA budget for FY 79 will be $193 million,
compared to $188.5 million in FY 78. Funding for direct
enforcement activities will increase by $4.2 million to a total
of $137.2 million, while DEA's research and development program
will be cut by more than half to $2.3 million.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">Overall, the FY 79 federal drug budget
proposal seems to maintain the status quo. The total expenditure
will increase a little, as it has in each of the past several
years; the relationship between treatment and enforcement
approaches will remain essentially unchanged.<br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> APPENDIX B: A Comment On The Role of State and Local
Governments* <br>
</p>

<p> <font size="1">The material for this appendix is largely
drawn from a paper by Peter Goldberg, &quot;The Role of the City
in Responding to the Problems of Drug Abuse,&quot; in <i>Rehabilitation
Aspects of Drug Dependence, </i>ed. Arnold Schecter (Cleveland:
CRC Press, 1977).<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">In addition to the federal government, state
and local governments have been active in the drug field.
However, the activities and directions of state and local
governments vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, thus making
it impossible to generalize about these efforts as if they were
uniform. In recent years, organizations such as the National
Association of State Drug Abuse Program Coordinators, the
National League of Cities, and U.S. Conference of Mayors have
attempted to catalog expenditures at the state and local level
and offer some general analysis of policy decisions and program
directions. The Drug Abuse Council cannot add substantively to
that information.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">One important issue, however, deserves
comment, that of the intergovernmental system for planning and
programming established by the Drug Abuse Office and Treatment
Act of 1972 (P. L. 92-255). The system, perhaps inadvertently,
has resulted in a nearly total absence of any sustained,
systematic large-city government participation in the state or
federal policy making and program planning processes. It is an
inexplicable situation, since the nation's most severe drug
problems are concentrated in its large central cities.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">The conditions of heroin addiction and crime
which initially prompted an expanded federal response to illicit
drug use in the early 1970s were concentrated in the larger
cities of this country. In fact, the increased federal response
was required partly because the scope and extent of the problems
associated with addictive drug use had far transcended the
ability of city governments to respond effectively. Also, state
governments-whose legislatures were frequently dominated by rural
and suburban interests-were often reluctant to become extensively
involved in what they felt was essentially a central-city
problem. Before the passage of the Drug Abuse Office and
Treatment Act of 1972, only New York, California, and Illinois
had undertaken major efforts in drug treatment and prevention.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="1">Nevertheless, when the federal government
began its large-scale expansion of the drug effort, the states
lobbied for and succeeded in obtaining the major role in that
effort. The role of local government was ignored; large
cities-where the social costs of illicit drug use are the most
severe-were left out of the formal policyrnaking and funding
process. This imbalance between city and state responsibilities
can be traced to the congressional authorization of annual
formula (block) grants to states, detailed in Section 409 of the
Drug Abuse Office and Treatment Act. In return for the block
grants, Congress required each state to establish a drug abuse
coordinating agency and annually prepare a drug abuse plan to
meet treatment and prevention needs. Thus Congress, in effect,
required even nonurban states such as North Dakota, Vermont, and
Montana-states having comparatively small drug problems-to plan a
drug abuse response effort, while cities such as Newark, Detroit,
New Orleans, Boston, and Los Angeles were ignored in the
legislation.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">The resulting problems were first of all
political. Large-city concerns and needs tend to be
underrepresented at the state level of government, where rural
and suburban interests are disproportionately powerful. Moreover,
blacks and other minority populations have added yet another
political concern, most clearly articulated in a resolution
passed by the National Black Caucus of Local Elected Officials in
June 1974. </font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">Whereas, unfortunately, the problems of drug
abuse have disproportionately affected large numbers of Black and
Spanish-speaking Americans, these minority populations tend to be
most underrepresented at the state level where drug abuse
policies are being increasingly formulated, thus creating a large
discrepancy between those most afflicted by the problems and
those establishing the policies and procedures to solve the
problems.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">In addition to these political concerns, the
drug problems themselves in rural and suburban areas are often
quite different from those in the central city. While heroin may
be the major drug of abuse (alcohol excepted) in the large
cities, other parts of a state are usually concerned with other
drugs. And while treatment may be the most pressing need in
dealing with heroin addiction in the central city, the emphasis
desired or demanded by the rest of the state may be for education
and prevention programs. Although the larger cities may want
increased funding for methadone programs, other areas of the
state where heroin is not a problem may be unsympathetic to this
use of one addictive drug to treat another. In the final
analysis, different units of government are bound to have
different needs, priorities, and philosophies, all justified from
their own perspectives.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">The imbalance between state and large-city
determinations of problems and priorities has become further
aggravated as the principal federal drug treatment and prevention
agency, NIDA, has sought to become more reliant on state plans in
determining federal funding decisions. In fact, NIDA has recently
announced its intention to fund virtually all of its treatment
and prevention efforts through statewide services contracts with
state governments by 1979. It is argued that this will be
administratively efficient; but this increasing substitution of
state decision making for federal does not augur well for the
large cities, where drug and drug-related problems are most
severe.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">In some instances a strong state role has
worked well; this is most often true in states where there are no
large urban centers. But in many other instances, potentially
serious problems between state and large-city governments have
impeded the effective flow of funds and delivery of services.
City organizations such as the National League of Cities and the
U.S. Conference of Mayors have repeatedly expressed their
dissatisfaction with the lack of state responsiveness to large
city needs in the drug area. Representatives of a number of
large-city governments have also voiced strong and specific
complaints about this. There is clearly a need to make some
adjustments in the state planning process so that plans more
adequately and appropriately allow for large-city needs and
participation. Such adjustments can be made without dismantling
the state planning system.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">NIDA and the cities need to communicate more
directly on drug issues and learn more from one another. To an
unfortunate extent federal drug policies are formulated without
discussion or collaboration with local elected officials from
areas where drug and drug-related problems are particularly
severe. This situation must be remedied if our drug policies and
programs are to work more efficiently. NIDA needs to develop
mechanisms by which it can more aggressively and systematically
seek large-city government input in its deliberations, and,
conversely, cities need to develop a better understanding of why
NIDA does what it does. The concept of an Office of Urban
Services within the NIDA bureaucracy to facilitate these crucial
interactions would seem to have merit.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">Finally, NIDA should seriously consider
initiating a program to fund city coordinating agencies with
responsibility for developing city-wide drug abuse plans in a
number of cities with the highest concentrations of drug-related
problems. These plans should provide for interaction with the
state government. Cleveland needs such an agency and plan far
more than does the state of Idaho, Atlanta more than Vermont.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="1">A federal system that funds only state drug
abuse plans and agencies is either focusing solely on
administrative ease or operating in ignorance of the actual
problems. Plans should not proliferate uncontrollably across the
country, but if the federal government is to require planning it
should at least make certain that there will be direct
participation from those areas most afflicted and concerned. An
additional benefit of funding city agencies would be that it
would give local elected officials a dependable and developed
local source of advice and assistance on drug issues and
problems.<br>

<p><b>LaGuardia Committee Report on Marihuana</b> </p>

<h1>INTELLECTUAL FUNCTIONING </h1>

<p><b>Florence Halpern, MA</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this phase of the study investigation was directed
primarily toward establishing the effect of marihuana on the
subject's intellectual functioning. An attempt was made to
determine what changes in mental ability occur under different
amounts of the drug, what direction these changes take, when they
are first measurable, and how long they persist. </p>

<p>TESTS Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test This test was used to
measure the general mental level of all the subjects. It was
chosen in preference to other available scales because it is the
only individual test of intelligence which has been standardized
on an adult population, takes into account both verbal and
performance abilities, and compares the individual with standards
established for his particular age group. It consists of ten
tests, five verbal and five performance. The verbal tests cover
the fields of general information and general comprehension, draw
on the individual's capacity for abstract reasoning and test his
arithmetical ability and his rote memory. The performance tests
also evaluate the subject's comprehension of social situations,
but here the results are independent of language. There are also
tests of the individual's ability to carry out a routine task, to
organize parts into a meaningful whole, to distinguish between
essential and unessential details, and to analyze and synthesize.
Army Alpha (Bregman Revision, Forms A, B. 5, 7 and Bellevue
Revision) This is a group test first used in the United States
Army in 1917 and 1918 when it was given to more than a million
recruits. It consists of eight tests: test 1, a direction test
which was not used in this study since the item does not appear
on all forms; test 2, a test of arithmetical reasoning; test 3, a
test of common sense in which the subject indicates which he
considers the best of three possible responses to a given
question; test 4, a.modified vocabulary test; tests. in which the
subject must mentally reorganize disarranged sentences and then
indicate whether the resultant statement is true or false; test
6, a test of numerical relations in which the subject must supply
the last two numbers in a numerical series on the basis of the
relationship between the first six numbers; test 7, a test of
analogies in which the subject determines the relationship
between two given words and then underlines one of four words
which is related to a third word in the same way; and test 8,
which on Forms A and B and on the Bellevue Revision is a test of
general information in which the subject is given a choice of
five answers to a question. On Forms 5 and 7, this test is a test
of directions. </p>

<p>Because this test has five alternate forms which are roughly
of equivalent difficulty it could be repeated many times within a
short time interval. It was therefore used to establish a curve
showing at what time following ingestion the marihuana has an
effect on general intelligence and on individual higher mental
processes. Pyle's Digit Symbol Test In this test each number from
1 through 9 is associated with a specific symbol, as, for
example, number 1 is associated with a square and number 2 with
an asterisk. The numbers and their associated symbols appear at
the top of the sheet of paper. Below the sample are rows of
symbols, five symbols to a row, followed by five blank squares.
The subject is expected to fill in each square with the number
associated with the respective symbol. With practice the
association bond between the number and the symbol becomes
stronger and the subject depends less and less on the model at
the top of the sheet. He is therefore able to work faster and his
learning rate is reflected in the increased number of squares
filled. Cancellation Test The subject is required to cross out a
specific geometric form wherever it appears on a sheet which is
covered with rows of geometric figures. This measures the
individual's capacity for carrying out a routine task. </p>

<p>Form Board Test The measurement of the ability to manipulate
concrete material in contrast to the verbal or abstract ability
determined by the Army Alpha test required the introduction of
certain form board tests. These were the Seguin Form Board, the
Two Figure Board, the Casuist Board, - the Five Figure Board,
Healy A, Triangle Test, Diagonal Test, all administered and
scored according to the Pintner-Patterson Performance Series. The
Seguin Form Board has ten blocks of various goemetric forms, to
be put in their appropriate places as rapidly as possible. Three
trials are given. The Two Figure Board has nine pieces which,
when placed correctly, form a large cross and a large square.
Time and the number of moves are recorded. The Casuist Board has
twelve pieces which, when correctly placed, form three circles
and an oval. Time and errors are recorded. The Five Figure Board
has five geometrical figures which are formed by the correct
placement of two or three pieces for each figure. Time and errors
are recorded. Healy A has five small rectangular pieces which,
when placed correctly, form a large rectangle. Time and the
number of moves are recorded. The Triangle Test consists of four
triangular pieces which are fitted together in a board. Time and
errors are recorded. The Diagonal Test has five pieces of various
shapes which must be fitted together in a rectangular frame. Time
and moves are recorded. Kohs Block Design Test This is a
performance test which is less a test of manual dexterity and
more dependent on abstract intelligence than are the form board
tests. It correlates more highly with intelligence than do most
performance items and yet it is entirely independent of language.
Therefore, the individual who cannot express himself well or who
suffers from a language handicap is not penalized as he is on
verbal scales. The test consists of sixteen cubes each with a
red, a white, a blue, a yellow, a red-and- white, and a
blue-and-yellow side. A colored design which can be reproduced
with the cubes is placed before the subject and he is expected to
make it. Results are rated numerically, depending upon the time
consumed in execution. In this experiment two sets of designs of
equivalent difficulty were required- Designs IV, VI, and XIV were
selected for one series and V, VII, and XII for the other. </p>

<p>Memory Tests Although memory in itself cannot be considered a
measure of intelligence, it is essential to any intelligent
functioning and must therefore be included in any estimate of
intelligence. Three aspects of memory, namely rote memory, the
ability tof recall presented objects, and visual memory were
tested. The rote memory test requires the repetition of digits in
forward and reverse order as given on the Bellevue Intelligence
Test. Object memory was tested by exposing ten small objects for
three seconds and recording the number of articles the subject
was able to recall. Visual memory or the ability to reproduce
designs after a ten-second exposure was estimated by using the
designs and scoring technique from the Army Performance Test.
PROCEDURE The Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test Each subject was
given the Bellevue Adult Intelligence test within two or three
days after his admission to the hospital and before any marihuana
had been administered. </p>

<p>The Army Alpha, Pyle's Digit Symbol, and Cancellation Tests
These tests were given as group tests to a total of 20 subjects.
The Army Alpha and Pyle's Digit Symbol tests were given every
half-hour, beginning a half-hour after drug ingestion. The Army
Alpha was continued for seven hours and Digit Symbol for five
hours. The Cancellation test was given every hour for six hours,
beginning one hour after drug administration. Eleven users and 9
non-users took the Army Alpha and the Digit Symbol tests, while 9
users and 11 non-users took the Cancellation test. Tests 2
through 8 of the Army Alpha require twenty and a half minutes for
actual performance while such preparations as the distribution of
papers and the reading of directions consume almost ten minutes
more, so that had the entire Alpha been given at each half-hourly
session, the subjects would have gone from test to test with no
intermittent rest period. For this reason the tests were divided
and the following schedule arranged: (table a)<br>
Each subject took three test series, one without the drug, one
with 2 cc. and one with 3, 4, 5, or 6 cc., depending on indi
vidual tolerance. A test series consisted of fourteen half-hour
sessions for the Alpha, ten half- hour sessions for the Digit
Symbol and seven hourly sessions for the Cancellation tests.
Because of the time factor, a series required two days for its
completion. The halves of a series were given on successive days,
and the different series a week apart. Thus for example, a
subject might take his first test series with 2 cc. on Monday and
Tuesday of one week; the following Monday and Tuesday the series
would be repeated with the subject in a different drug state (no
drug or S cc.); and a final series would be given the third week
with the subject in still another drug condition. </p>

<p>An effort was made to obviate practice effect by giving the
first test series to one third of the subjects without drug, to
one third with 2 cc., and to one third with 3, 4, or 5 cc.
However because of the necessity of increasing dosage gradually
this ideal presentation was not actually obtained. The following
gives the amount of drug administered to users and non-users at
each test series. </p>

<p>(table b) Since the various forms of the Army Alpha are not
absolutely equivalent in difficulty, their order of presentation
for any one group had to be identical in each of the three drug
states. However, for each of the three groups tested the order of
presentation was different so that all the difficult forms did
not come at the same interval, as is shown on the following page.
Kohs Block Design, Form Board, and Memory Tests Administration of
these tests differed markedly from those discussed above in that
no attempt was made to give them at regular successive time
intervals. Rather, they formed part of a battery of individual
tests given to various subjects under specific drug conditions.
For example, 5 cc. of marihuana would be ordered for a patient
for 8:00 A.M., and testing began as soon thereafter as the
patient appeared &quot;high,&quot; the state of
&quot;highness&quot; being judged by the subject's own statement,
his pulse rate, the condition of his pupils and other
physiological signs. </p>

<p>(table c) Kohs Block Design was given to each subject twice,
once without the drug and once with 5 cc. The test was taken by a
total of 21 subjects, 10 users and 11 non-users. Five users tools
the test first without the drug, S had their first trial with 5
cc. Of the non-user group 8 had their first trial without
marihuana, 3 with 4 cc. The average time at which the test was
given to the user group was three and a half hours after drug
administration, with range from two to five and a half hours. For
the nonuser group, the average time of administration of the test
was also three and a half hours after the drug was given, range
two and a half to five and a half hours. </p>

<p>The two series of designs (one series being Designs IV, VI and
XIV, the other V, VII and XII) were presented in such manner that
half of the subjects were tested on one series and half on the
other series while they were under the influence of marihuana.
Thus any difference in degree of difficulty between the two sets
of designs was canceled out. The weighted scores given on the
Arthur Point scale were used in evaluating the results. </p>

<p>Form Board Tests were divided into three batteries, each
battery consisting of the Seguin Form Board, one of the three
larger boards (Two Figure, Five Figure, or Casuist) and one of
the three smaller boards. Various combinations of boards were
used under various drug conditions in order to make the results
as comparable as possible. The following indicates the number of
times the various boards were used with different dosages of
marihuana. </p>

<p>From the results it appears that Gwyn Triangle was used too
often with 5 cc. and Healy A was not used often enough. </p>

<p>(table d) </p>

<p>Aside from the Triangle and the Healy A, the distribution of
boards in different drug stages was such as to obviate any
differences in degree of difficulty. Nineteen subjects, 10 users
and 9 non- users, took this test. The results were scored for
time and errors according to the Pintner-Patterson Performance
series. </p>

<p>Memory tests. The first digit span test was always given
before marihuana had been administered, since the Bellewe Scale
was given each patient during the first two or three days of the
study. The trials under 2 cc. and 5 cc. were alternated. In all,
28 subjects, 17 users and 11 non-users, took this test before and
after the ingestion of marihuana. The final score equaled the
number of digits recalled. </p>

<p>To test Object Memory, ten small articles such as a key, a
ring, a pill box, and a crayon were placed on a flat, neutral
surface and exposed for three seconds. An attempt was made to
vary some of the articles at each presentation so that six or
seven were the same and three or four were different. Twenty-six
subjects, 11 users and 15 non-users, took this test. They were so
divided that 10 of them took the test the first time without
drug, 10 with 2 cc., and 6 with 5 cc. </p>

<p>To test Visual Memory, Army designs were given each subject
three times, once prior to the administration of marihuana, once
under 2 cc., and once under 5 cc. The test was riven to a total
of 28 subiects. 16 users and 12 non-users. Because there is no
alternative form for this test, results were definitely
influenced by practice. </p>

<p>Here, therefore, more than with any other test, it became
important to arrange the order of administration. The following
indicates the dosage of marihuana at the first test. </p>

<p>(table e) </p>

<p>It is obvious that the initial examination was given slightly
more often when the subjects were not under the influence of the
drug. </p>

<p>Improvement derived from practice is therefore more of a
factor in the tests which were performed under marihuana. </p>

<h2>FINDINGS</h2>

<p>Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test General Intelligence. The
results of the Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test which was
administered to 60 subjects, 40 users and 20 non-users, are shown
in Table 5. As has been pointed out elsewhere, these findings
indicate that both the user and the non-user groups may be
classified as of average intelligence. </p>

<p>(Table 5) </p>

<p>Mental Deterioration. Studies of mental deterioration due to
toxic, organic or psychotic factors, as given in the literature,
reveal that in such cases the subtest scores on the Bellevue
Adult Intelligence Test show marked irregularity, depending upon
the functions involved in the deteriorative process. As a group,
the marihuana users tested show very even functioning, and what
little irregularity occurred can be explained on the basis of
language and racial factors.(4) From this we may conclude that
the marihuana users had suffered no mental deterioration as a
result of their use of the drug. The age factor does not affect
the result since the groups were well equated in this respect. </p>

<p>Army Alpha Test Total Mental Functioning. The total scores
obtained from this test at the successive testing periods are
shown in Table 6. Those recorded before the administration of the
drug give a picture like that seen in any learning curve, that
is, there is a gradual increment in test scores at each testing
interval, interspersed with plateau periods. </p>

<p>Thus, without drug the test score for the second testing
interval showed a 2 per cent gain over the initial score, the
score for the third testing interval showed a 4 per cent gain
over the initial score, and so on up to the last testing period
when there was a 13 per cent gain over the initial test score. </p>

<p>Between two and a half and three hours after ingestion of 2
cc. of the drug there appeared to be a possible very slight
falling off in mental ability. Otherwise the results paralleled
the findings obtained in the undrugged condition except that
toward the end of the day the increments were larger than those
which occurred when the subjects were undrugged. This may be due
to complications in the experimental procedure or may be an
indication of accelerated mental functioning resulting from drug
ingestion. This point is discussed more fully when the effect on
different mental functions is considered. </p>

<p>Deleterious effects were apparent an hour after the ingestion
of 5 cc. of marihuana. There was a 3 per cent drop from the
initial score at this one-hour period and this first attainment
is not surpassed until four and a half hours after drug
ingestion. From the four-and-a- half- hour period on to the end
of the testing there were gradual increments in score. </p>

<p>Different Mental Functions. A very elaborate study was made of
the scores made on the subtest (Table 7). Some irregularities
occurred even in the undrugged state, and these may be attributed
primarily to chance factors, as, for example, the difference in
difficulty of the various test forms. On the whole, the findings
were in line with those which one would expect in any situation
where constant repetition increases efficiency. </p>

<p>The effects of 2 cc. of marihuana on the different mental
functions were variable. Tests involving number concepts gave
clear-cut, consistent findings and revealed that impairment
occurred an hour after the drug was taken and continued for from
two and a half to three hours after ingestion. Results of other
tests showed that there was little if any loss in ability, and
some of them, especially those done toward the end of the day,
showed gains which exceeded the ones made in the undrugged state.
It is not possible on the basis of the present data to ascertain
whether these large increments indicate that small amounts of the
drug serve as stimulants in situations dependent primarily upon
verbal facility or whether they are due to certain complications
in the test technique. The former theory coincides with the
increased verbosity noted on other tests as well as with the
clinical impression, but the latter also cannot be overlooked. </p>

<p>Further investigation of this point is definitely indicated. </p>

<p>The effect of the 5 cc. dosage on each function was in line
with that reported for total scores, that is, there was a falling
off in efficiency one hour after the drug was taken and this
impairment continued for anywhere from three and a half to six
and a half hours after ingestion. Here too the scores on tests
involving number concepts were most severely affected, recovery
for them taking place from six to six and a half hours after drug
administration. </p>

<p>Degree and Duration of Drug Effect. In general it may be
stated that marihuana has a deleterious effect on mental
functioning, the extent, time of onset, and duration of the
impairment being related to the amount of drug taken. </p>

<p>The adverse effect of the 2 cc. dosage on global intelligence
was slight (about 3 per cent to 4 per cent impairment in
efficiency) and of sort duration, occurring at about two and a
half hours after ingestion and lasting little longer than a
half-hour or an hour. Certain mental functions, especially those
dealing with number concepts, appear to have been affected much
earlier than others, the effect on the number test scores being
measurable as early as one hour after ingestion and continuing
until two and a half hours after ingestion. For other functions,
in particular those involving verbal facility, the results were
variable, in some instances showing no adverse effect and even a
slight acceleration. </p>

<p>The effect of 5 cc. of marihuana on global intellectual
functioning was apparent within an hour from the time the drug
was taken and was operative until four and a half hours after
ingestion. All mental functions showed this early impairment but
for some of them recovery from the adverse effect was earlier
than for others. Those most severely impaired from point of view
of duration were the ones dealing with number concepts. </p>

<p>(Table 6) </p>

<p>The testing program was continued for only seven hours after
the drug was taken and, therefore, any estimate of the effect of
marihuana after this time is purely a subjective one. However,
both the subject and the examiner felt that the drug produced a
&quot;hang- over&quot; which in most cases continued into the
following day. The subject complained of being headachy, sleepy,
and unable to work at his usual level, and the examiner also
noted that the subject did not work as well or as quickly when
called upon to do something on a day following marihuana
ingestion. </p>

<p>The impairment reported here is not entirely representative of
the maximum impairment which occurs under the influence of
marihuana. Two opposing variables account for the results
obtained in the drugged condition. One variable is practice
effect which tends to increase test scores with each succeeding
trial. The other variable, the drug, tends to lower test scores.
In the earlier sessions there was evidence that the marihuana,
especially when given in large doses, is the more potent force,
as seen by the continuing downward trend of the curve during the
first few hours. In these earlier phases, in spite of repetition,
results were lower with each succeeding trial, or if there was no
actual loss, the increments made were never comparable to those
made in the undrugged state. Three or four hours after drug
administration there was a general trend toward rising scores.
Some of this gain must be attributed to increased practice effect
which was counteracting, in part at least, the deleterious effect
of the marihuana. For this reason it is not certain that the drug
was less effective at later points in the curve than it was at
the moment of seemingly greatest impairment. This seems
particularly plausible because, beginning with the third hour,
the subject was no longer working on new tasks but was actually
repeating identical tasks that he performed earlier in the day.
Thus, at the third hour the test form used was the same as the
one given at the initial session; at the end of the
three-and-a-half-hour period the form was the same as the
one-hour examination, and so on. What is shown in the curves is
the effect of marihuana on intellectual tasks with which the
subject has become very familiar. For practical purposes the test
situation has the advantage of being comparable with daily living
since the tasks performed in daily routine are usually relatively
familiar ones. </p>

<p>(Table 7) </p>

<p>Speed Versus Power. Intellectual impairment under the
influence of marihuana resulted from a loss in both speed and
efficiency. There was a slowing up in output indicated by the
difference in the number of items done before and after the
administration of the drug. On the whole the number of test items
attempted tended to increase at each succeeding examination
period even when the subject was under the influence of
marihuana, but the percentage of increase in the drugged state
practically never equaled that attained for the corresponding
time interval when the subject had not ingested the drug. The
findings for the number of items done in the drugged and
undrugged condition follow very closely the findings in respect
to the number of items correctly done. From this it may be
concluded that under the influence of marihuana an individual
functions less rapidly and also less efficiently than when he has
had no drug. </p>

<p>Careful analysis of what causes the loss in efficiency reveals
that certain factors not necessarily related to mental ability
per se were accountable for the reduced scores in the drugged
state. For example, under the influence of the drug the subject
felt dizzy, had blurred vision, or exhibited other handicapping
physiological disturbances. These impeded his efficiency in
putting his answer on the correct line, or marking a cross in the
right box. Men were observed running their fingers across the
page in an effort to keep their place. On the other hand, much of
the intellectual loss can be ascribed to an impairment in the
thinking processes, and there seemed to be a general confusion of
ideas and inability to maintain a fixed goal. Some subjects
reported that the reason they accomplished so little was that, by
the time they had finished reading a question, they no longer
remembered what their purpose in reading it had been.
Occasionally perseveration of a form of response specific to one
test was found in a subsequent test. For example, some forms of
the Same-Opposite test require the subject to mark the answer S
or O. In a later test requiring a plus or minus response
occasional irrelevant S's or O's appeared. </p>

<p>Comparison of the Effect of Marihuana on User and Non-User. </p>

<p>When the group is divided into marihuana users and nonusers
certain interesting and suggestive differences are revealed
(Table 8). </p>

<p>Although the general findings for total intelligence scores
for the two groups follow similar curves, the deleterious effects
were not as great on the user as on the non-user. Thus under 2
cc. of marihuana the user showed no real intellectual impairment
except for a very short interval beginning about two and a half
hours after ingestion and lasting for an hour or an hour and a
half. In contrast to this he made gains both at the beginning of
the testing and toward the end of the day which exceeded those
made in the undrugged state. The non-user who had ingested 2 cc.
of marihuana showed a definite drop in score beginning about two
and a half hours after ingestion, and for a period from one and a
half to two and a half hours after this time he did not make
increments comparable to those which he made in the undrugged
state. Following this, during the last two hours of testing he,
like the user, obtained scores which showed an acceleration not
paralleled in the undrugged state. </p>

<p>(Table 8) </p>

<p>Under 5 cc. of marihuana both the user and the non-user showed
a 3 per cent loss in efficiency within an hour of the time that
the drug was taken. Although recovery was slow for both groups,
the user was less severely affected, as is indicated by the fact
that at the next testing interval his score was only 1 per cent
below his initial score as compared with a 7 per cent loss on the
part of the non-user. The disparity in the degree of impairment
for the two groups continued for several hours. The more marked
drug effect in the case of the non-user was further evidenced by
the fact that the user showed recovery four or four and a half
hours after ingestion (as measured by the time when his scores
approach those made when in the undrugged state) while the
non-user, even at the end of seven hours of testing, did not
approximate his undrugged performances. </p>

<p>No simple explanation of this difference is available. The
most probable reason seems to be that previous use of the drug in
some way serves to ameliorate that anxiety and inevitable
disorganization which the use of any drug may have on an
individual who has never taken it before. Another explanation may
lie in possible physiological adaptation to the drug which,
though not identical with tolerance in the ordinary
pharmacological sense, seems to act in the same direction. </p>

<p>Variability. The results reported here are all in terms of
averages. </p>

<p>A study of individual scores indicates that there was marked
variability in the effect of the drug on different subjects. In
one case the drug action came early and soon disappeared. Another
subject experienced no reaction until after he had eaten his
lunch, at which time a very definite effect was apparent. A third
subject showed impairment late in the day when the drug effect on
almost all the other subjects had worn off. There were some hardy
souls who did not appear to be affected by even large quantities
of marihuana, while a few (mainly non-users) became so ill that
they could not continue with the examinations. </p>

<p>Pyle's Digit Symbol Test Comparison of the results obtained on
this test when the subject was in the undrugged condition and
when he had had 2 cc. of marihuana reveals that small amounts of
the drug did not interfere with his ability to carry out the
appointed task (Table 9). In fact, as was noted above for certain
other tests, the improvement in score at the end of two and a
half or three hours was greater after the ingestion of 2 cc. of
marihuana than it was when no drug had been administered, and at
the end of the five-hour testing period there was a 32 per cent
increase in score as against a 22 per cent increase in the
undrugged condition. </p>

<p>Under the influence of 5 cc. of marihuana, however, there was
a decrease in ability occuring within an hour after the time the
drug was administered. Although the scores show no actual loss as
compared with the initial score, the increments did not equal
those made in the undrugged condition until from four to four and
a half hours after ingestion. </p>

<p>It may therefore be concluded that certain types of learning
ability are not affected by small amounts (2 cc.) of marihuana,
but are impaired when larger amounts (5 cc.) are ingested. </p>

<p>(Table 9) (Table 10) </p>

<p>Cancelling a Geometric Form The results of this test are shown
in Table 10. </p>

<p>With 2 cc. of marihuana, there was a slight falling off in the
subject's efficiency occurring about three hours after drug
ingestion. </p>

<p>At that time he was 3 per cent less efficient than he had been
an hour previous. With S cc. of marihuana there was a slowing up
in the subject's ability to carry out the appointed task, which
was apparent two hours after drug ingestion (and possibly
earlier). At that time there was only a 4 per cent increment over
his initial score as compared with a 10 per cent increment in the
undrugged state and a 12 per cent increment when the 2 cc. dosage
had been administered. </p>

<p>He improved only slightly at the three- and four-hour testing
interval, and only at the five-hour interval did he show an
appreciable improvement. </p>

<p>Apparently, the carrying out of a simple routine task is
adversely affected to a slight degree and for a short period of
time as the result of the ingestion of 2 cc. of marihuana while
the ingestion of S cc. of the drug produces adverse effects which
are more severe and more lasting. </p>

<p>Performance Tests Seguin Form Board. For adults of average
intelligence this test is primarily one involving speed of
reaction time. The average time taken by the subjects when they
were not under the influence of marihuana was 12.8 seconds. This
was increased to 14.0 and 14.1 seconds under doses of 2 cc. and 5
cc. respectively. Thus, ingestion of marihuana in 2 cc. and 5 cc.
doses caused a 9 per cent delay in performance time. </p>

<p>Form Boards. The time scores for this test remained
practically the same whether no drug, 2 cc. or 5 cc. of marihuana
had been administered, the average scores in terms of mental age
being respectively 11.7, 11.7 and 11.9 years. The error scores
also showed little change as a result of drug ingestion, the
averages in terms of mental age being 9.7 years (no marihuana),
9.9 years (2 cc.) and 10.2 years (5 cc.), and what change
occurred was in a positive direction, that is, there was a very
slight improvement in the subject's performance when he was under
the influence of marihuana. </p>

<p>Kohs Block Design. This test correlates more highly with
abstract intelligence than do any of the other performance tests.
Here the drug had a definitely deleterious effect when it was
administered in large amounts. The average score was 17.6 when
the subjects were not under the influence of marihuana and 14.8
after they had ingested the drug; that is, under S cc. of
marihuana there was a 16 per cent loss in score as compared with
undrugged results. </p>

<p>In general it appears that those functions most closely as
sociated with higher intellectual processes are more impaired by
the drug than are the simpler functions.<br>
Memory Tests Rote Memory. As measured by the ability to repeat
digits forward there were no changes in rote memory as a result
of drug ingestion, the average scores under no drug, 2 cc. of
marihuana, and 5 cc. of marihuana being in each case 7.1. </p>

<p>Digits Reversed. Although the giving of digits in reverse
order is always grouped with memory testss this task actually
requires something over and above mere recall. It demands a
mental control not necessary in tests dependent purely upon rote
memory. Although simple rote memory, as measured by the ability
to repeat digits forward, was not affected by the ingestion of
marihuana, the repetition of digits reversed was affected
adversely. In the undrugged state the average for the group was
5.4, with 2 cc. the average was 5.0, and with S cc. it was 4.8.
The impairment was comparatively small but it seems to have been
related to the amount of drug taken. </p>

<p>Object Memory. The average scores under no drug, 2 cc. of
marihuana, and 5 cc. of marihuana were respectively 6.2, 5.6, and
5.9- that is, there was a loss of about 9 per cent in the
subject's ability to recall objects which had been exposed to his
vision for three seconds when he took the test under the
influence of 2 cc. of marihuana, while after the ingestion of 5
cc. the impairment was less, being only about 5 per cent. This
seemingly contradictory result is probably due to the fact that
by the time the subjects took the test under the influence of 5
cc. most of them had already had it two times previously. The
loss in terms of absolute number of remembered articles was
slight. </p>

<p>Visual Memory. In this test as in the case of digits reversed
something over and above simple memory function is involved. A
capacity for analysis and synthesis which correlates well with
intelligence is required for the successful execution of this
task, and it is this function which is adversely affected by the
ingestion of marihuana. The average scores were 10.3 (no drug),
9.7 (2 cc.) and 7.8 (5 cc.); that is, after the ingestion of 2
cc. of marihuana there was a 6 per cent drop in score, while
under 5 cc. there was a 24 per cent drop. </p>

<p>In general one may conclude that simple memory functions are
not affected by the administration of marihuana while the more
complex memory functions are affected adversely, the extent of
the impairment being related to the amount of drug taken. </p>

<p>Throughout the examination of subjects on individual tests,
the same difference was observed in intensity of the effect upon
user and non-user as was noted in group tests.<br>
Experiments with Marihuana cigarettes In addition to the tests
made to determine the effect of the ingestion of marihuana on
various intellectual functions, several experiments were tried
with marihuana cigarettes. The tests used in this part of the
study were the Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test; the Woody McCall
Mixed Fundamentals Test, Form I, which consists of thirty-five
examples requiring addition, subtraction, multiplication or
division; a cancellation test in which the subject is required to
cross out a specific number (in this instance the number 8)
wherever it appears on a sheet covered with rows of numbers; the
Kohs Block Design Test; and the test for rote, object, and visual
memory. </p>

<p>The subjects took the test series and individual tests twice,
once without the drug and once after having smoked marihuana
cigarettes. They were not given a specific number of cigarettes
but were told to smoke until they felt &quot;high.&quot; The
number of cigarettes smoked to produce this effect ranged from
two to seven. </p>

<p>The Mixed Fundamentals and cancellation tests were given as
group tests and were repeated at half-hour intervals for two and
a half hours. In the series given when the subjects were
&quot;high,&quot; the first test was taken as soon as the
cigarettes had been smoked. Time limit on each test was one and a
half minutes. </p>

<p>The Bellevue Adult, Kohs, and memory tests were given as
individual tests and were administered only twice, once before
the subject had smoked marihuana cigarettes and once after he had
become &quot;high&quot; from smoking them. If during the course
of the examination he wanted another cigarette or the examiner
had reason to suspect that he was no longer under the influence
of the drug, more cigarettes were smoked. The number of
cigarettes used during a three-hour testing period ranged from
six to twelve. </p>

<p>In the cancellation, Kohs, and memory tests the subjects were
so divided that half took the tests for the first time before
they had smoked and half after they had smoked. In the Woody
McCall Mixed Fundamentals Test more non-users had their first
tests before they had smoked. The Bellevue Adult Intelligence
Test was always given first without the drug during the two or
three days immediately following the subject's admission. Four
weeks later the test was repeated on 10 subjects while they were
under the influence of marihuana cigarettes. </p>

<p>Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test Ten subjects, 5 users and 5
non-users, repeated this test under the influence of marihuana.
The results are shown in Table 11. </p>

<p>(TABLE 11) </p>

<p>Since the test taken when the subject was &quot;high&quot; was
always his second experience with it, some allowance must be made
for practice effect. Without drug the average I.Q. of these
subjects was 101.6, while after they had smoked cigarettes it was
104.4. This increase of only 2.8 points is smaller than one would
probably get with repetition occurring after such a short time
interval. It may be concluded, therefore, that smoking marihuana
cigarettes has some negative effect on intellectual functioning,
in that the subject benefits less from previous experiences than
he would if he had not smoked. <br>
Woody McCall Mixed Fundamentals Test, Form 1 This test was given
to 24 subjects, 10 users and 14 non-users. </p>

<p>&gt;From the results which are shown in Table 12 it may be
concluded that when the subject was &quot;high&quot; after
smoking marihuana cigarettes there was a slowing up in his
ability to do simple arithmetic calculations. This lag occurred
within the first half-hour after smoking and continued for at
least an hour. The deleterious effect was not such as to cause an
actual loss in ability but the increments resulting from repeated
practice were never as great in the drugged as in the undrugged
state. Thus, the initial increment was 10 per cent in the test
given before smoking and only 4 per cent in the one administered
after the subject had become &quot;high.&quot; The final
increment at the end of two and a half hours was 20 per cent
without drug, 13 per cent with drug. </p>

<p>This test measures the subject's ability to use acquired
knowledge. </p>

<p>Under the influence of marihuana cigarettes the capacity for
using such an acquired skill is not lost but is slowed down. The
adverse effect of smoking marihuana in cigarette form occurs
almost immediately in contrast to the delayed action of the
pills. </p>

<p>(TABLE 12) </p>

<p>Cancelling 8's Sixteen subjects, 8 users and 8 non-users, took
this test, the results of which are shown in Table 13. As a
result of smoking marihuana cigarettes the subject worked a
little slower in his execution of a routine task than he did when
he had not smoked. The increment over the initial score in the
test score made a half-hour after he became &quot;high&quot; was
only 7 per cent as against an increment of 9 per cent when the
cigarettes had not been smoked. His performance was slowed up for
one hour after smoking and possibly longer. </p>

<p>(TABLE 13) </p>

<p>Kohs Block Design Test This test, which measures performance
ability, was given to a total of 9 subjects, 6 users and 3
non-users. The average score without the drug was 18.5, and after
cigarettes had been smoked 14.7. This difference in score of 3.8
points indicates a loss in efficiency of 21 per cent. </p>

<p>Memory Tests Rote Memory. Thirteen users and 9 non-users took
this test. </p>

<p>Neither in repeating digits forward nor in giving them in
reverse did the subjects show any disadvantageous effects from
the use of marihuana cigarettes, the average scores before and
after smoking being 6.9 and 7.1 respectively for the digits
forward test and 5.2 and 5.1 for the digits reversed test. The
only explanation for this deviation from the results obtained
when marihuana was taken in pill form is the inability to control
the dosage when marihuana is given in cigarette form. </p>

<p>Object Memory. Thirteen subjects took this test. Object memory
was not impaired by the smoking of marihuana, the average scores
being 6.8 before the cigarettes were smoked and 7.1 when the
subjects were &quot;high.&quot; Visual Memory. There was an .8
point loss (from 10-5 to 9.7) in the average score of the 20
subjects, 11 users and 9 non-users, who took this test. This
represents an impairment of about 8 per cent. </p>

<p>Effect of Marihuana Cigarettes on Users and Non-Users The
difference in intensity of effect of marihuana cigarettes on the
user and on the non- user was not the same as the difference in
the effect of the marihuana concentrate on these two groups. The
user was usually more affected by smoking marihuana than was the
non- user, probably because the nonuser did not smoke as much or
as intensely as the user and was not as much under the influence
of the drug. <br>

<h1>The Facts About Drug Abuse </h1>

<p> <b>The Drug Abuse Council, 1980</b> </p>

<h2>Drug-Law Enforcement Efforts </h2>

<p> John R. Pekkanen </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"> </p>

<p> When the city of San Francisco passed an ordinance n 1875
banning the smoking o opium in opium dens.&quot; it marked the
first time a law prohibiting the use of narcotics was enacted in
this country. Since then cities, states and the federal
government have enacted a great number of drug laws. Some have
been stringent, others more lenient. Some were passed during
politically volatile periods when &quot;get tough&quot;
approaches were thought to be the answer; others were passed
during calmer times when more moderate approaches were sought. </p>

<p> To understand why we embarked on a course of prohibition for
particular drugs is a difficult and elusive undertaking, too
affected by deeply rooted attitudes and prejudices to allow for
completely dispassionate inquiry. Drug laws from their inception
were a special breed. In effect, the passage of these prohibitory
laws created crimes by definition; drug activities derived their
criminal label more from prevailing attitudes and prejudices than
from actual threats to persons or property. These were laws by
which people could and did express social disapproval, and were
not in the tradition of laws enacted to protect us from those who
steal, murder, or commit fraud. They were the means by which
right and wrong were distinguished according to popular but
arbitrary national values and mores. </p>

<p> In many instances, a proposed drug law would begin as an
attempt to control the use of a certain substance, such as opium,
cocaine, or marijuana. The rhetoric surrounding the proposed
antidrug law would usually call for the preservation of
predominant social and moral values, and it would be offered as a
means of restoring those &quot;lost&quot; values. Frequently such
a law would be directed at an outcast or minority segment of
society identified with the use of the drug. I Supporters of the
law would offer it as a solution to a wide range of social,
moral, racial, political, and economic problems-from unemployment
and crime in the streets to preserving the white race. </p>

<p> Early in the consideration of the Harrison Narcotic Act (the
first major federal antinarcotics act2), there was some
discussion about the hazards of legislating morality, but these
cautions were soon put aside. In essence, the Harrison Narcotic
Act was a tax law enacted to achieve a moral end, similar in that
regard to the Volstead Act prohibiting alcohol. Since then, drug
laws and the enforcement policies which flow from them have never
been seriously challenged. </p>

<p> In his study of alcohol prohibition, Symbolic Crusade: Status
Politics and the American Temperance Movement,3 Joseph Gusfield
examines the components of criminal law and separates them into
&quot;instrumental&quot; and &quot;symbolic&quot; aspects.
Applied to antidrug laws, the &quot;instrumental&quot; aspect is
what the law states as its intention-i.e., the prevention of the
use and availability of certain drugs. The &quot;symbolic&quot;
aspect may have an importance as great as or greater than that of
the instrumental*: In the case of antidrug laws, part of the
symbolic function has been to define users of particular drugs as
abnormal and to designate their behavior as criminal. When this
labelling process was attempted with alcohol prohibition as w
ell, it failed because the number of alcohol users in the country
was so large and diverse that no one group could be singled out
and designated as &quot;abnormal&quot; exclusively because of
drinking alcohol. </p>

<p> *These two functions of the law were best exemplified by the
report of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse,
which called for the retention of laws against simple marijuana
possession but not enforcement of those laws. The law by itself
would discourage use, it was argued, and not enforcing it would
avoid stigmatizing those who did use the drug. </p>

<p> However, the use of certain drugs, such as opium, heroin,
and-until the 1970s-marijuana was most often primarily confined
to subgroups and minorities, whose separation and isolation were
more easily accomplished. This fact partly explains why only
congressional approval was needed to ban narcotics and marijuana,
while alcohol prohibition required a constitutional amendment,
and why when antidrug laws have appeared to be unsuccessful their
total repeal has never been seriously considered, although repeal
was possible with alcohol prohibition. </p>

<p> In the material that follows, the law enforcement approach to
the control of certain drugs will be discussed from five
perspectives: the development of the laws themselves; how the
agencies charged with enforcing drug control laws have gone about
their task; the relationship between drug use and crime; a case
study of the impact of the nation's &quot;toughest&quot; drug
control law, the New York State Drug Law Amendments of 1973; and
the impact of drug law enforcement on illicit drug-using
behavior. </p>

<hr>

<p> <b>Drug Control Laws and Policies</b> </p>

<p> Efforts to control certain drugs have come in cycles,
focusing on specific drugs during specific periods. 4 Generally,
the demand for tough drug control has been most vociferous during
periods of economic or political turmoil in the United States.
The antiopium crusade began during the depression of the 1870s;
the anticocaine crusade came during a period of racial turmoil in
the South . 5 Federal sanctions against selected drugs toughened
considerably between 1915 and 1920, during the first &quot;Red
Scare&quot;; the prohibition of alcohol was of course also
effected during this period. Later, during the depression of the
1930s, the entry of many Mexicans and Mexican-Americans into the
labor market in the Southwest appears to have been a major cause
of the antimarijuana crusade and attendant laws. The creation of
the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN) in 1930 established the
preeminence of law enforcement in the drug field, a fact which
has not changed over the years. The FBN's initial major drug
targets were heroin and marijuana; this policy lasted for more
than thirty five years.&quot; </p>

<p> In the 1940s drug control activities remained relatively
stable. There were no new demands for harsh laws or policies.
States adopted legislation comparable to the Harrison Act, the
major federal drug law, and this tightened the nation's drug
prohibition policy, There were also outbreaks of concern over the
misuse of legitimately produced drugs-amphetamines and
barbiturates were the most widely abused-but these drugs escaped
the full force of the antidrug effort. By 1950, however, the
atmosphere had changed, and many voices demanded new, tougher
antidrug laws.7 </p>

<p> Between 1947 and 1950, an apparent increase in illicit drug
use was reported among blacks and Puerto Ricans in many northern
cities. This caused alarm, creating support for passage of a new,
more stringent drug law in 1951. Commonly called the Boggs Act
after its sponsor, the late Representative Hale Boggs, it enacted
the harshest penalties for drug law violations to date . 8
Historian David Musto notes in The American Disease, &quot;Hale
Boggs's bill, which contained mandatory sentences, was passed in
1951 at the beginning of the McCarthy era and fears of Soviet
aggression, the 'betrayal' of China to the Communists, and
suspicion of domestic groups and persons who seemed to threaten
overthrow of the government.&quot;&quot; In 1956 an even more
severe federal narcotics bill was enacted which empowered a jury
to impose the death penalty on anyone over the age of eighteen
selling heroin to anyone Under the age of eighteen. 10 Several
states also enacted extremely harsh laws during this period,
imposing heavy penalties for both sellers and users. </p>

<p> This &quot;tough&quot; approach was eventually moderated: the
mid-1960s marked the beginning of a more comprehensive approach
to drug law enforcement. New criminal laws regulated
&quot;dangerous drugs&quot;-i.e., legally produced hallucinogens,
stimulants, and depressants. These laws were more moderate in
tone and substance, and marked a belated attempt at more uniform
policy at the federal level for the control of legitimate and
illegitimately produced drugs. The previous concern had been
exclusively with a very few illicit drugs like heroin, cocaine,
and marijuana. </p>

<p> The present era in drug law enforcement, an outgrowth of the
1960s, was inaugurated during the Nixon administration which
organized an intensified, coordinated federal antidrug program.
This was the heralded &quot;war on drug abuse.&quot;&quot; The
Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970
replaced the former crazy-quilt of criminal drug law statutes
which had been gradually patched together since the beginning of
the century. 12 Through the Controlled Substances Act portion of
the legislation, psychoactive drugs were placed into five
schedules according to their presumed potential hazards. The
federal drug bureaucracy, which had gradually grown since the
1920s, was restructured and further expanded. </p>

<p> As important as these steps were in modernizing the American
approach to drug control and in moderating the Draconian criminal
penalties of the 1950s, the new era did not break significantly
with the past in any fundamental way. The law enforcement
approach to drug use remained fixed and, except for a relatively
brief period, continued to receive the bulk of federal dollars
expended in the drug field. Popular notions about drugs were not
significantly altered, nor were traditional responses seriously
questioned. The beliefs in the almost mystical power of illicit
drugs over people may have become more sophisticated, but they
did not change radically. Users of opiate drugs, instead of being
viewed merely as criminals, were now charitably viewed as
&quot;sick&quot; criminals. But they were still viewed as
criminals, and still are. </p>

<p> Perhaps one of the most important ideas to remain unchanged
was the belief in a direct link between illicit drugs and crime.
This presumed link, which had been the basis for the harsh drug
laws of the past, remained a permanent fixture. The nature of
this assumed relationship-as is discussed in later sections of
this chapter-has undergone some changes, but the basic belief in
a causal link has not. </p>

<p> Whatever the causes and motives behind the nation's drug
laws, the inescapable conclusion from the more than one hundred
years of experience since the first prohibitory law was enacted
is that they have not stopped or even diminished the use of
illicit drugs. For example, in 1924 the U.S. Public Health
Service estimated the opiate addict population at two hundred
fifteen thousands ; although imprecise, this figure is considered
to be the most reliable of that period. In 1976 the National
Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) estimated the heroin addict
population at five hundred thousand; other recent studies
indicate that the figure for all types of heroin users may be two
to four million. 14 Allowing for population increases, there are
more heroin users today than there were a half century ago. The
same appears to hold true for users of other illicit drugs. </p>

<p> Because of such findings, our drug laws and policies are more
openly questioned today than at any point in the past. On one
hand there are those who argue that government has no right at
all to intervene in the private lives of individuals. This view
holds that drug use is essentially a private act, and that
therefore government ought not intervene unless drug-taking leads
to socially disruptive or criminal behavior. A more pragmatic
aspect of this position is the feeling that laws and policies can
do little to diminish the supply of illicit substances because of
the enormous profitability involved and the consequent
development of highly organized &quot;black market&quot;
distribution networks. It is argued that the government's
resources could be better used in attempting to change the
conditions that contribute to illicit drug use-i.e., poverty,
unemployment, and other social problems-than to continue
self-defeating efforts to eliminate the supply and use of
particular drugs. </p>

<p> On the other hand, there are those who feel the government's
antidrug effort is doing about as well as can be expected in
cutting back the supply of illicit drugs, short of abridging
everyone's civil liberties. They argue that if law enforcement
programs did not attempt to diminish supply and frighten some
individuals from using drugs, our drug problems might be far
greater than they are. Then there are those who argue we are not
doing nearly enough, that more severe and repressive approaches
and policies are needed if we are to combat and eradicate the
&quot;enemy, drug abuse.&quot; In its extreme form, this latter
view holds that no price is too great to pay in order to achieve
this end. </p>

<p> However, much of the debate over drug control laws has failed
to focus sufficiently on the difficulties involved in enforcing
them. Passing a drug law is only one part of a control effort;
enforcing it is quite another. It is important to understand that
even when operating at maximum effectiveness, there are serious
limits to what law enforcement agencies can achieve. </p>

<p> One of the primary problems that American drug law
enforcement must face is that the drug laws and drug policies
have been consistently oversold by public officials. Burglary
laws are not expected to eliminate burglary, and penalties for
armed robbery are not expected to eliminate that crime; yet drug
laws are expected to eliminate illicit drug sale and use- a
standard has been set for drug laws that was never set for other
laws. More has frequently been promised than could possibly be
delivered. Consequently, as long as illicit drug use has
persisted, the policies against it have been regarded by some as
abject failures. What is needed in any discussion of drug control
policies is a realistic notion of what they can and cannot
achieve, and what their costs and benefits are. Only when we
understand this will the long cycle of overreaction to the use of
particular drugs subside. </p>

<hr>

<p> <b>Law Enforcement Activities</b> </p>

<p> Basically, there are two strategies by which law enforcement
seeks to discourage illicit drug use: The first seeks to disrupt
and discourage use by enforcing domestic laws against drug use
and internal trafficking; the second seeks to prevent supplies of
illicit drugs from entering the country, either by preventing
their cultivation abroad or by intercepting shipments to the
United States. The latter strategy is largely the work of federal
agents, although state and local agencies may occasionally
participate. The efforts to control illicit drug use within the
United States are conducted by federal, state, and local agents.
Occasionally these different levels of government join forces and
work together; all too frequently, however, they act
independently, jealously guarding their &quot;turf&quot; (i.e.,
their resources and sources of information) from one another. </p>

<p> At the federal level the Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), at present the chief drug enforcement agency, has over
four thousand employees, of whom over two thousand are agents. 15
(While this number may sound impressively large, it merely
approximates the size of the New York City Transit Authority
Police, a force that patrols the subways and buses in that city).
Several other federal agencies play various roles in the
enforcement of federal drug laws: Among these are the Customs
Service, which attempts to screen incoming persons and freight
for illicit drugs; the Internal Revenue Service, which pursues
tax law violations of illicit drug traffickers; the Law
Enforcement Assistance Administration, which provides research
and funding support for state and local drug enforcement; and the
U.S. Coast Guard, which patrols coastlines and harbor areas for
illicit drug trafficking. </p>

<p> At the state and local level there is a substantially larger
number of personnel actively engaged in drug enforcement-the
police; but an exact count is not available, since regular
-patrolmen generally enforce drug laws along with their other
duties. Special narcotics units have been established in
virtually every major-city police department as well as in many
state police departments; most major cities also give some drug
law enforcement training to their uniformed patrolmen. </p>

<p> The strategies for controlling both drug use and supplies
incorporate a number of variables. The analyses that follow
attempt to summarize each strategy and identify some of their
costs and benefits. </p>

<p> Controlling Drug Use. Drug enforcement is unlike most other
types of police enforcement activities where generally a crime is
committed and reported and the police investigate, gathering
evidence and making their case. The victim is central to this
process; he or she initiates the police investigation; it is
often the testimony of the victim during the trial that convicts
the offender. </p>

<p> In drug cases, police usually do not have victims on whom to
rely. Not only are there no complainants, but everyone involved
conspires to conceal the crime from the police. As a result most
illicit drug offenses go entirely undetected; the percentage of
violations which result in arrest are extremely low.17 </p>

<p> Of those drug violations which do result in arrest, more than
75 percent are &quot;spontaneous&quot; arrests involving no prior
police investigation. 18 These drug arrests are often incidental
to an another investigation. For example, if the driver of an
automobile is stopped for a traffic violation and the arresting
officer sees marijuana or suspects its presence and finds
evidence of a drug law offense, a drug arrest may follow. Such
arrests are not due to any overall drug enforcement strategy, but
are rather the result of normal, day-to-day police enforcement
activities. This helps explain why the overwhelming number of
drug arrests are for simple possession, with a majority of these
involving marijuana. </p>

<p> Arrests for simple illicit drug possession have little if any
impact on the overall availability of illicit drugs because they
largely fail to affect drug distribution. The major distributors
of illicit drugs conduct their drug transactions in secret, and,
as in other activities involving drugs, there are no
complainants. Major drug dealers have developed very
sophisticated methods of concealment, including drop systems and
other subterfuges. Even well-known dealers are usually able to
avoid creating probable cause for arrest. Because of this secrecy
and the absence of complainants, the fundamental problem police
face in making arrests for drug trafficking is proving that
something illegal took place. While this can be difficult enough
in cases of simple possession, it is extremely difficult with
drug trafficking, particularly in developing the so-called
&quot;high-level&quot; cases. While many who use illicit drugs
participate to some degree in drug distribution (whether for
profit or not), those who import and deal in large quantities of
particular illicit drugs are not easy to identify, apprehend, or
successfully prosecute. </p>

<p> Undercover Investigations. Narcotics officers at the federal,
state, and local levels often work undercover, and may become
participants in aspects of the offense in order to gather
sufficient evidence to prove a crime has been committed. This
work is hazardous, time-consuming, and, as one former Deputy
Attorney General told Congress, &quot;a dirty, miserable
business.&quot;&quot;' The most serious practical shortcoming of
undercover operations is that, despite the publicity such
operations receive when successful, they result in the arrest of
only a miniscule proportion of those engaged in major drug
trafficking. Moreover, each undercover operation is so
time-consuming, and the number of policemen with the temperament
and skill for this work so limited, that the percentage of major
arrests would not increase substantially even if every undercover
operation were successful. </p>

<p> These problems of investigation are as true at federal as at
state and local levels. In fact, one of the persistent criticisms
of the federal drug enforcement effort is that the overwhelming
majority of arrests are of relatively low-level dealers. A 1975
analysis by the Government Accounting Office of 1974 Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA) arrests revealed that only 604
(3.6 percent) of the total 16,796 arrests were Class I violators,
and of these only 63 were convicted. 20 (Class I violators are
major international drug traffickers, drug laboratory operators,
or wholesalers.)&quot; In addition, GAO found only 5 percent of
the arrests to be Class 11 violators, a lesser but still
significant category of offenders. However, following
congressional hearings and considerable public criticism, DEA
appears to have made a major effort to pursue more Class I and H
offenders even at the expense of overall arrest figures. DEA
statistics for 1976 show only 6,143 total drug arrests, but of
these 15 percent were for Class I and 1 1. 9 percent for Class 11
offenses. Still, nearly three-quarters of the arrests were Class
III and IV arrests, a statistic that indicates that major drug
trafficking arrests continue to be elusive in spite of increased
efforts . 22 </p>

<p> An important consequence of undercover operations is that
with arrest and trial of the suspect the undercover officer's
cover is &quot;blown&quot; and his usefulness in that line of
work in that region is usually ended. This is a serious problem,
because good undercover officers are few and far between.
Undercover operations also pose a number of legal problems; for
example, defense attorneys often argue, sometimes successfully,
that the undercover officer is guilty of &quot;entrapment&quot;
by having enticed the defendant into committing the crime in
question. </p>

<p> Another hazard here is the potential for police corruption.
The possibility of corruption through payoffs is always present,
because the sums of money involved in illicit drug traffic are
enormous-generally estimated to involve several billions of
dollars nationally per year-and because the salaries of policemen
are generally rather low. Additionally, substantial amounts of
&quot;buy&quot; money are provided by law enforcement agencies
for this work; in fiscal year 1976, for example, the DEA budget
called for $9 million for &quot;buy&quot; money to be used in
procuring information and allowing agents to &quot;buy into&quot;
drug transactions in the gathering of evidence .23 All major-city
and state narcotics enforcement agencies have substantial amounts
of this &quot;buy&quot; money. With these great sums of money the
possibilities for corruption can be great. Temptation can be
abetted by the fact that the undercover agent is operating in a
lawless environment where one's normal sense of right and wrong
can become distorted. In New York City the corruption of
narcotics investigators reached serious proportions .24 After the
Knapp Commission revelations, the New York City Police Department
instituted a procedure whereby any undercover officer on the
Street Crime Unit is required to obtain specific approval by a
superior officer to make a drug arrest, and, furthermore, that
arrest must be witnessed by the superior officer. This rather
cumbersome policy is still in effect today. </p>

<p> Not all forms of corruption involve money, however. As
mentioned above, there can also be a corruption of attitude
caused by a police officer's constant exposure to the mores of
the underworld. In Buy and Bust Mark Moore writes, &quot;They
[undercover agents] will know more about the violation and the
violators they attack than police usually do, and will sometimes
have personal interests at stake in the arrests. This invites
them to exercise their authority in accordance with their
intimate knowledge rather than what the law requires. 1125 For
example, in some cases undercover police might protect certain
dealers who have acted as informants and select others for
arrest. Such choices are made not on the basis of law but upon
past collaboration or even friendship. Close relationships bred
by undercover ' work can influence a police officer to change his
views on the law, what it means, and his requirements to uphold
it. 211 </p>

<p> Intelligence Gathering. Many critics have argued that if drug
enforcement agencies were to gather and organize intelligence in
a more systematic way, more could be done to successfully
investigate major drug traffickers. Such intelligence presumably
would give more detailed information about the methods drug
traffickers employ and accordingly provide a better overall
picture of trafficking operations. However, the assumption that
better intelligence would lead to more successful enforcement
here is open to question. Nevertheless, this debate does
highlight another basic problem: That drug enforcement agents
traditionally have been hostile toward intelligence functions
performed by special units within their own agencies. As Moore
notes, &quot;No investigator would be happy to admit [to an
intelligence analyst] that he had not mined the files of his
organization for every nugget of relevant information. 1117 One
result is that different agents with different items of
information, which if systematically collected and analyzed might
provide greater information about drug transactions and networks,
often do not share it. Thus the efforts of intelligence units
within the DEA and other drug enforcement agencies are often
thwarted. </p>

<p> I Lack of Coordination. Although many state and local police
agencies rely on federal help to train and establish their
narcotics units, there is a notable absence of uniformity and
coordination between the various levels of law enforcement
agencies. As a police chief in one large American city has
remarked, </p>

<p> It's always been a problem over the years to sort out the
roles of federal, state and local agencies. My obligations to the
citizens of my city are not the same as the Bureau of Narcotics
and Dangerous Drugs [now the DEA], for example. They take a
systems approach, then make a management by objectives analysis,
they can target people and work on them. In the metropolitan
police departments, such as this one, we're at the low rung of
the law enforcement ladder, and we can't do that. We have to be
responsive to the citizen who calls in with just a meager amount
of information but expects and is entitled to action on it. 28 </p>

<p> Overlapping jurisdictions, as well as the different emphases
given to different drugs and to various aspects of enforcement
models, have created conflict. As a result, some local police
believe federal drug enforcement should confine itself to
interstate and international trafficking and should not involve
itself in &quot;local&quot; investigations. </p>

<p> While the basic assumption has been that local police will
enforce laws against small-time street dealers and users, state
police will enforce laws against the larger dealers, and the
federal government will concentrate on the major traffickers and
wholesalers, this has not always been the case. The federal
government investigates cases throughout the country, sometimes
informing state or local police agencies and sometimes not doing
so; its cases do not necessarily involve truly major interstate
or international violations. Because of these overlaps, the three
levels of drug enforcement remain to this day uncoordinated,
competitive, and at times conflicting. This continuing lack of
coordination, coupled with the other pitfalls of domestic drug
enforcement, have at times led to an acute sense of frustration
on the part of police, policymakers, and the public. As a
consequence, excessive measures periodically find support. One
recent, well-known example of this process of frustration and
overreaction involved the now defunct Office of Drug Abuse Law
Enforcement. </p>

<p> ODALE: A Case History. The Office of Drug Abuse Law
Enforcement (ODALE) was established in early 1972 by executive
order of President Nixon and charged with the mission of waging
an even tougher &quot;war&quot; on illicit drug users and dealers
than had been attempted in the past.211 The brief history of this
short-lived agency illustrates the excesses to which a &quot;war
on drugs&quot; philosophy can lead. It also highlights the
difficult position of drug law enforcement in attempting to
enforce the law justly without overstepping constitutional
safeguards. </p>

<p> ODALE was criticized from its inception for being an
&quot;election-year stunt&quot; while being simultaneously lauded
as a bold attempt to fight drug traffickers. ODALE was ostensibly
controlled by the justice Department but actually operated by
direction of the White House. Its initial creation was something
of a curiosity in that the federal government already had two
competing agencies, the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs
(BNDD) and the Customs Bureau, in the forefront of its drug
control effort. ODALE's potential for engendering yet more
bureaucratic rivalry was soon realized; within the space of a few
months, the agency had eclipsed the other traditional federal
drug enforcement efforts in influence. 30 </p>

<p> ODALE was staffed by employees from a number of federal
agencies, including BNDD, Customs, the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS), and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. The
agents from these departments were deployed into &quot;strike
forces&quot; which were authorized to use &quot;no-knock&quot;
search warrants, court-authorized wiretaps, and other search
privileges when &quot;incidental to arrest.&quot; Furthermore,
ODALE could forward the names of suspected drug traffickers to a
special committee in IRS which could then initiate special audits
or investigations of them.31 </p>

<p> ODALE received most of its funds from the Law Enforcement
Assistance Administration (LEAA), which is empowered by Congress
to fund state and local law enforcement units. While it was not
within the authority of LEAA to directly fund ODALE, a federal
agency, this barrier was skirted by having LEAA make grants to
local police departments participating in drug raids with ODALE
agents. This funding process also allowed ODALE to circumvent
budget appropriation proceedings in Congress. These steps, while
apparently within the letter of the law, were not in its spirit,
but they went largely unchallenged in the name of fighting
&quot;drug abuse. &quot;32 </p>

<p> One of ODALE's first acts was to establish the &quot;heroin
hotline,&quot; a toll-free number which people could call if they
knew or suspected someone of dealing in illicit drugs. Although
the &quot;hotline&quot; received abundant publicity its
accomplishments in aiding drug enforcement were minimal at most.
Only a few months after it was installed, &quot;hotline&quot;
callers were told by a recording to call another number; the
&quot;hotline&quot; was out of business .33 </p>

<p> The excesses this new agency fostered came vividly to light
on the night of April 23, 1973 in Collinsville, Illinois, when
ODALE agents broke into the house of Mr. and Mrs. Herbert J.
Giglotto, asleep at the time, routed them out of bed, roughed
them up, and accused them of drug dealing. But the ODALE agents
had made a mistake and come to the wrong house. They made a
second mistaken raid in another home that very night. These
events led to the suspension of the involved agents. Eventually
they were brought to trial on criminal charges, but were
acquitted.34 </p>

<p> The adverse publicity generated by the Collinsville raids
crippled ODALE's effectiveness and power. But the creation of
that agency and the extraordinary powers given to it demonstrate
how the impulse to combat the use of particular drugs and the
uncritical attitude accompanying that impulse can lead to an
overzealous approach which can seriously erode constitutional
safeguards. The excesses of ODALE were almost predictable, as in
past instances when the climate for stamping out illicit drug use
was equally extreme. </p>

<p> A number of questions surround ODALE even after its
bureaucratic demise. Was it created solely to combat illicit drug
use? Why was such a unique agency with unique powers believed to
be needed? The answers to these questions are not and may never
be clear, because of different interpretations of what ODALE was
or attempted to be. What does seem to be clear, however, is that
ODALE represented one more attempt to allay public fears by
striking hard at illicit drug use with tough enforcement. What is
also clear is that in spite of the hoopla surrounding its
inception, ODALE's arrest statistics reveal that virtually every
individual arrested by the agency was a minor, street-level
dealer of little or no consequence. 35 </p>

<p> Controlling Drug Supplies. In addition to efforts to control
the numbers of users and distributors of illicit drugs through
the criminal justice process, the federal government also has
sought to reduce the quantity of illicit drugs available for use.
There are two ways American law enforcement agencies have sought
to control the supply of illicit drugs: intercepting them as they
come into the country, and destroying them at their source in
other countries. </p>

<p> Interdiction. Many of the illicit drugs used in this country
are produced in foreign nations. One exception is marijuana,
which is grown both within and without the United States,
although the bulk of it is produced in foreign countries; other
exceptions are synthetic psychoactive drugs produced in
laboratories (rather than refined from a harvested plant)-e.g.,
amphetamines, barbiturates, and some hallucinogens. Cocaine and
heroin, officially considered to be the major illicit drugs of
abuse in the United States, originate in other countries. An
obvious --some might say simplistic-drug control strategy is to
try to prevent these illicit substances from reaching this
country. Upon closer examination, this strategy proves to be an
awesome task. </p>

<p> Anyone who has ever passed through American Customs at the
Canadian or Mexican borders or our sea- or airports realizes that
there is rarely any thorough inspection. The vast numbers who
daily cross into and out of American jurisdiction make thorough
inspection of every traveler a practical impossibility. In
addition, American borders have traditionally been open;
constitutional safeguards define the manner and circumstances of
searches. Successful seizures of illicit drugs therefore depend
more on intelligence information than on the luck of random
searches. This intelligence information is usually supplied by
American drug agents in foreign countries, who attempt to
identify drug traffickers to later be either arrested at the
border or kept under surveillance and arrested within the United
States. * </p>

<p> However, even with good intelligence information, preventing
illicit drugs from entering this country is a difficult, indeed
nearly impossible task .311 When the estimated amount of illicit
drugs consumed in this nation is compared with amount seized at
our borders or other ports of entry, it is clear that only a very
small percentage of the drugs being smuggled into the country are
confiscated. </p>

<p> It is estimated, for example, that from twelve to twenty
thousand pounds of high-purity heroin are smuggled into this
country each year&quot;; but in fiscal year 1974 only 115 pounds
of high-purity heroin was seized at all U.S. borders and ports.
This means that, combining this with the amount of heroin seized
internally by the authorities in domestic operations, only 670
pounds of heroin were confiscated that year .38 By fiscal year
1976, after intensive effort, domestic seizures had increased to
a total of 1,124 pounds of heroin, still far short of the total
incoming amount. The publicity accorded these seizures, however,
often has conveyed the impression that law enforcement agencies
are making major inroads against illicit drug smuggling. To a
large extent this publicity has been generated by the agency
involved in the seizure, for both political and bureaucratic
reasons. </p>

<p> Perhaps the most widely used technique for embellishing the
importance of a seizure of illicit drugs is to state the
&quot;street value&quot; of the seized drug.311 A seizure of
fifteen pounds of heroin, therefore, might not be merely a
fifteen-pound seizure, but a seizure of &quot;thirty million
dollars' worth of drugs.&quot; The &quot;street value&quot;
figure is elastic and sometimes exaggerated; it often reflects
the most optimistic price a dealer might possibly ask for his
drugs. This is analogous to estimating the value of rustled
cattle by the price they would bring as steaks at the best
restaurants. What is omitted in these claims of the &quot;street
value&quot; of drugs seized is the fact that between $5 and $11
billion worth of illicit drugs is sold in this country each year
.40 Thus, $30 million or even $300 million, while significant, is
still but a tiny fraction of the total, and has little if any
impact on the total amount of illicit sales. However, when
seizures drop, enforcement agencies frequently also use the
decline to indicate the success of their efforts. </p>

<p> *Additionally, international interdiction also has included
investigations by U.S. agents abroad in cooperation with foreign
governments, and the arrests of drug traffickers in certain
countries. However, U.S. agents are now prohibited by law from
participating in the arrest of individuals in foreign countries. </p>

<p> By this self-serving logic, the drug law enforcement agencies
nearly always can appear to be successful. </p>

<p> Although drug seizure data have often been misused by
competing drug agencies to enhance their public images, seizures
can have a disruptive effect and present an economic risk to drug
traffickers. In addition, limited amounts of these drugs are of
course kept out of the illicit market. </p>

<p> Historically, border interdiction has been a major source of
rivalry among the federal agencies charged with controlling
illicit drugs-specifically, between the Customs Bureau and the
justice Department's drug agencies, from the Federal Bureau of
Narcotics to the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs to the
present Drug Enforcement Administration.&quot; Government
reorganizations, as well as a number of other attempts to
reconcile these disputes-such as specifying which international
areas each agency should be responsible for-have not completely
succeeded in quieting this rivalry, although DEA's incorporation
of some of the drug enforcement duties of Customs has certainly
allayed it. </p>

<p> These jurisdictional disputes have appeared at many critical
points in the federal drug enforcement effort. For example, when
drug agents in a foreign country obtain information regarding a
significant drug-smuggling attempt, this information would
ideally be relayed to the U.S., in order to effect an arrest on
U.S. territory; here, however, the federal drug law enforcement
process often broke down. In some cases Customs would insist that
the drugs be intercepted at the border, to make certain they did
not enter the country, while FBN, BNDD, or DEA would insist that
the smuggler be allowed through the border, whence he might lead
to &quot;higher ups&quot; in the smuggling operation. In point of
fact, however, many times the true reason for these differences
was the desire of each agency to make the drug seizure and arrest
itself. The competing agencies eventually began circumventing one
another, refusing to reveal what they were doing or whom they
were investigating. Sometimes one agency would deliberately
interrupt the investigation of another with a premature arrest.
In one celebrated instance, two agencies, unknown to one another,
were involved in the same investigation; in a showdown shooting
erupted, with agents from two federal agencies of the United
States government mistakenly shooting at each other.&quot; How
often disruptions of this kind occurred is difficult to estimate,
but it is clear that the rivalry was a serious impediment to
effective federal drug control and an embarrassment to the
government generally. </p>

<p> Another problem with border interdiction is simply that our
borders with both Mexico and Canada are so easily accessible;
trying to make them less accessible in order to seize more drugs
would not only erode freedom of entrance and egress, but probably
would not work anyway. As noted, the major border drug seizures
generally result from intelligence information supplied to border
agents. Few illicit drugs are uncovered in random searches, as
Operation Intercept-an attempt to cut off drug supplies at the
Mexican border-amply demonstrated in September 1969. That effort
affords another illustration of the ineffectiveness of extreme
measures taken in the name of fighting illicit drugs. </p>

<p> Operation Intercept: A Case History. The Mexican border has
traditionally been a major trafficking point, both because large
quantities of illicit drugs are produced in Mexico and because
the 1,945-mile border is mostly unguarded. In addition to bridge
and river crossings, it is believed that 200 aircraft carrying
illicit drugs daily fly illegally from Mexico into the United
States. 43 </p>

<p> In September 1909 President Nixon ordered &quot;the country's
largest peacetime search and seizure operation by civil
authorities&quot; along the United States-Mexico border. 44 Two
thousand Customs and border patrol agents began systematically
searching all cars and persons coming from Mexico into the United
States. There were delays of several hours in what is normally a
very quick crossing process over the border. Individuals who
appeared suspicious or argumentative were often stripped and
bodily searched. The tourism traffic between the two countries
was seriously interrupted. And although more than five million
people passed over this border during the three weeks Operation
Intercept was in full gear, virtually no heroin or any other
illicit drug was confiscated. In defense of the project, the
government later explained that its primary intention was not to
interdict drugs at the border, but rather to pressure Mexico into
eradicating its crops of marijuana and Opium.41 While it may have
had this effect eventually, the project had little direct impact
on illicit drug trafficking. </p>

<p> Elimination of the Supply. The most recent major American
supply reduction strategy is &quot;eradication at the
source.&quot; This policy was created in part because of the lack
of success in controlling supply through traditional domestic
enforcement and international interdiction and in part because
advanced technology seemed to make it more feasible than before.
In brief, the objective is to eliminate the crops which furnish
illicit drugs to the American market. </p>

<p> Bolivia, Peru, and Columbia are the major U.S. sources of
cocaine, while opium (the raw material for heroin) is grown in
many countries throughout the world, including Thailand,
Cambodia, Vietnam, Mexico, Turkey, India, and Iran. Marijuana is
grown throughout Mexico and Central and South America in addition
to the United States. However, heroin is the major drug priority
of the federal government, and the most advanced
&quot;eradication at the source&quot; program underway now is
against the opium poppy. Although substantial amounts of
cocaine-from fifteen to one hundred tons annually-regularly flow
into the United States, cocaine remains a lower priority .411 No
major cocaine eradication program has been attempted, because of
the hardy nature of the coca plant (from which cocaine is
derived) and because these plants are grown near drinking water
supplies and closely intermingled with food crops, making
eradication programs extremely difficult if not impossible to
accomplish in safety. Marijuana, despite official disclaimers of
interest, results in the greatest annual seizures47 and is the
object of current American-supported eradication efforts in
Mexico .41 </p>

<p> The key to any eradication program's success is the
cooperation of the foreign government in whose country the drug
is grown and the ability of that government to effect an
eradication policy in its rural areas. Basically, the theory of
eradication rests on the simple premise that if opium poppies or
marijuana plants are-eliminated in sufficient numbers the drug
they produce will also be largely eliminated. To this end, the
United States now actively participates in eradication programs
for both of these illicit drugs. </p>

<p> Opium poppies are grown in many regions of the world; no
special climate or soil conditions are needed. The main
requirement is cheap, abundant manual labor to do the painstaking
work of harvesting. It is estimated that only sixty to one
hundred tons of raw opium are required each year to supply the
entire illicit U.S. market with heroin, an amount which could be
produced from only ten square miles of opium poppies.&quot; (One
hundred tons of opium yields approximately ten tons of pure
heroin5O; the raw opium, which is extracted directly from the
opium poppy, is converted into a morphine base and then into
heroin by a relatively simple cooking and chemical-bonding
process.) </p>

<p> There are two other significant factors which work against
the success of the eradication strategy. First, the opium poppy
has a long tradition in many cultures where it is grown; it is
used for fodder, fuel, oil, and as a pain-killing agent. In many
regions of the world indigenous families have been growing opium
poppies for centuries. Second, opium poppies are a valuable cash
crop in those regions. Even when sold legally, the poppy crops
support many farmers and their families. There are few substitute
crops that will earn more per unit of land.51 </p>

<p> Although the United States has encouraged worldwide
prohibition of illicit opium cultivation through bilateral and
multilateral agreements for more than sixty years, these efforts
have largely failed. One of the reasons for this is that our
prohibition of heroin has inflated the price of the drug, thereby
making it even more profitable to cultivate opium poppies
illegally. </p>

<p> In 1971 this country launched a major effort to restrict the
cultivation of foreign opium when it reached an agreement with
Turkey to ban the cultivation of opium poppies there. In return,
the United States agreed to reimburse the Turkish government $35
million for lost revenues. </p>

<p> (Ultimately, only part of this amount was actually paid to
Turkey. )52 Although the United States selected Turkey as the
site for trying its new policy because Turkish opium was believed
to account for 80 _percent of the illicit heroin used in the
U.S., there was no way to verify this estimate, since it is
nearly impossible to trace heroin back to its original source. 53
It is in fact uncertain that Turkish opium poppies did supply 80
percent of American heroin, since it is also believed that Turkey
grew only about 8 percent of the world's opium poppies.54 In
addition, the existence of other opium-growing areas and the
profitability of the American heroin trade would make the
long-term impact of such a ban questionable; other countries
growing larger amounts of opium had controls as lax as Turkey's,
and much of the opium from these countries also found its way
into the black market. It has also been suggested that Turkey was
selected because, as a NATO ally, it was more susceptible to U.S.
leverage than many other countries. </p>

<p> Whatever the reasons for choosing Turkey, the results of the
opium ban not only failed to stop the flow of heroin into this
country but seriously strained relations between the two
countries until Turkey unilaterally rescinded the ban in 1975 .
5-1 In place of the opium-growing ban, the Turkish government at
this time initiated a centralized poppy-harvesting method called
the &quot;poppy straw process&quot;: This process requires that
the opium poppies be harvested whole rather than lanced, meaning
that the raw opium is brought to secure, central locations before
the extraction process is carried out, and forbids farmers to
lance the poppy pods themselves. This change has reduced if not
eliminated the export of illicit Turkish opium. This stoppage of
Turkish opium, however, led to a substantial increase in illicit
heroin from Mexican sources. As one study noted, </p>

<p> Although the opium ban in Turkey, together with a major
enforcement effort in France which broke up a ring of French and
French-Corsican chemists and traffickers in 1973, did put a
temporary crimp in the supply of heroin in the U.S., Mexican
opium growers and traffickers rapidly took over the market. By
1975 the U.S. government was declaring that over 80 percent of
the heroin available in the U.S. came from Mexico, instead of
Turkey. &quot; </p>

<p> As the illicit Turkish opium supply dwindled and the price of
heroin rose in response, the economics of heroin trafficking thus
became even more favorable, and new suppliers were attracted to
it. For example, in opium-producing countries an investment of
$250 now buys one ounce of 90 percent pure heroin; when cut with
forty dollars' worth of quinine, thereby converting the original
ounce of heroin into one kilo of 21/2 percent purity (an average
level for American heroin), the value becomes $15 per gram, or a
total of $15,000 for the original investment of $290. 57 These
economics keep the international heroin market flourishing and
make significant and lasting eradication extremely difficult to
accomplish. </p>

<p> Mexican heroin-noted for its brown color, a result of the
refining process which has no effect on the quality of the
heroin-quickly filled the vacuum created by the Turkish poppy
ban. In fact, heroin is a great economic boon to regions in
northern Mexico; that mountainous and largely inaccessible region
produces some twenty tons of heroin a year. As noted in one
report on the Mexican heroin trade, </p>

<p> Assuming, however, that only the 10 tons of heroin (from the
tri-state area) reached the border where it would sell in 1975 at
$45,000 a kilo (border value), the value of that crop alone would
be $450 million. The heroin crop alone is thus Mexico's most
valuable commodity. Sugar, shrimp, coffee and cotton, the next
four most valuable commodities, do not total $450 million
together. '8 </p>

<p> In response to this new influx of heroin, the United States
and Mexico agreed in 1973 to attempt another type of eradication
strategy. Essentially, the United States agreed to provide
technical assistance and equipment for a herbicide-spraying
program to eradicate illicit Mexican drug producing crops.
Although marijuana was included, the opium poppy was the primary
target of the eradication program from the American point of
view. This program remains the United States' most ambitious
eradication effort. 59 </p>

<p> During the early phases of the program less than ten thousand
opium poppy fields per year were destroyed manually. These ten
thousand fields represented approximately three to four thousand
acres. In November 1975 aerial spraying began, and by 1976 the
total number of fields reportedly destroyed had risen to twenty
thousand. In 1977, some forty seven thousand poppy fields,
representing an estimated fourteen thousand acres, were
destroyed. This increase was primarily due to the change from
manual to aerial herbicide spraying.60 </p>

<p> The spraying program is conducted year-round and affects
large sections of Mexico, including nearly half of the western
coast. At the present time the herbicide paraquat is used to
eradicate marijuana-a major goal of the Mexican government-and
the chemical &quot;2,4-D,&quot; is used on opium poppies. The
program is assisted by the U.S. government in a number of ways. A
State Department official recently described the Mexican
eradication effort to a congressional committee thus: </p>

<p> The principal forms of State Department-administered support
to the Mexican drug effort have included the furnishing of
aircraft and telecommunications equipment, together with the
requisite training to enable the Mexicans to use them in modern
applications to drug detection, poppy eradication, and
enforcement work. Our technical assistance together with certain
commodities, is also helping them to establish and administer a
network of forward bases in the important eradication areas and
to improve intelligence collection, retrieval, and analysis.
Training and salary supplements are provided to aid. the Mexican]
Federal judicial Police to develop and hold a cadre of qualified
narcotics agents.&quot;' </p>

<p> The United States provided Mexico with approximately $50
million in assistance funds for marijuana and opium poppy control
from 1973 to 1977. Proposed assistance for 1978 was estimated to
be about $13.3 million. Most of these funds are used to purchase
aircraft and support services for the aerial eradication program.
Aircraft supplied by the United States includes more than forty
helicopters and thirty-five fixed-wing aircraft. In addition,
some twenty to twenty-five DEA agents are assigned full time with
the Mexican eradication effort to provide technical assistance.
112 </p>

<p> As an enforcement strategy, eradication at the source may
have some advantages over other reduction and control strategies.
First, there is less potential for domestic police corruption.
Second, as compared to interdiction and undercover efforts it is
a relatively inexpensive way of preventing illicit drugs from
entering the United States. </p>

<p> However, the criteria for determining the success of such an
operation are uncertain. For instance, it is not known what
quantity of illicit drugs were smuggled into this country from
Mexico either before the program or now. However, the State
Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration report that
Mexican brown heroin, which formerly accounted for 80 to 85
percent of the heroin available in this country, has dropped to
60 to 65 percent of the total. Also, the retail and wholesale
prices of heroin have reportedly increased as much as 50 to 75
percent along the U.S.-Mexican border, and increases of as much
as 150 percent have been noted. 113 However, a rise in heroin
prices is not in itself a totally accurate indication of the
effects of a control strategy on heroin use. In fact, higher
heroin prices may be, at best, a mixed blessing. </p>

<p> Eradication policies, when they successfully interrupt
illicit drug production, as the Mexican opium poppy program has
apparently done, may reduce the American heroin supply for a
time, perhaps two or three years. In 1977, heroin-related deaths
dropped approximately 40 percent in this country, a possible
indication that the eradication program was having a beneficial
effect.114 It was also reported by enforcement officials that
American heroin supplies in 1978 were at their lowest level in
several years; however, they admit they have little hard evidence
on which to base that estimate. Moreover, as will be discussed
later, reducing the heroin supply may lead to other social
problems. </p>

<p> There are a number of possible side-effects to such an
eradication program which must also be considered. For example,
Mexican marijuana sprayed with paraquat has reached the United
States; samples seized near the border after the eradication
program began showed that 21 percent were contaminated with
significant levels of paraquat.115 It has been indicated that
paraquat may pose a significant health danger to those who ingest
it. The Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and
Welfare announced a National Institute on Drug Abuse study in
March 1978. </p>

<p> The report's preliminary findings suggest that if an
individual smokes three to five heavily contaminated marihuana
cigarettes each day for several months, irreversible lung damage
will result. The report cautions, however, that there could be a
risk of lung damage for individuals who use marihuana less often
or in smaller amounts. Although these results are preliminary,
the report concludes that Paraquat contamination may pose a
serious risk to marihuana smokers. 66 </p>

<p> Although one might argue that anyone who uses an illegal
substance like marijuana must bear the consequences and the
risks, the fact remains that as many as forty-five million
Americans have tried marijuana and approximately eleven million
are regular users. The preponderance of medical evidence to date
shows that marijuana is a relatively harmless intoxicant when
used moderately. Therefore, it seems ironic that an official
program may itself produce a serious health risk for the
individual smoker, when the ostensible reason for prohibition in
the first place was to protect users from harming themselves. </p>

<p> The eradication strategy has another shortcoming as well:
Experience has shown that as one opium supply system is
diminished, another develops to take its place, at even more
attractive profits due to the rise in heroin prices caused by the
temporary shortage. Shortly after the Mexican eradication program
began, for example, white heroin from the &quot;Golden
Triangle&quot; in Southeast Asia began to enter the country. Drug
enforcement officials suspect that many Turkish nationals are
involved in this Southeast Asian traffic, which suggests that the
Turkish opium ban may have been more effective with the crop than
with the traffickers. </p>

<p> There is a larger problem, however, which holds the greatest
potential danger. If the country designated for crop eradication
efforts-in this case Mexico-is not part of a vigorous ongoing
program, then its illicit opium production will probably be
revived after the eradication efforts slow or stop. And it may
revive at a time when other areas of the world are also producing
large amounts of illicit heroin for the U.S. market. Then, rather
than facing illicit heroin smuggling from only one major area,
this country could be faced with two or more major supply
sources. This possibility remains a strong one, because the
eradication program depends upon the internal policies and
politics of foreign governments, any one of which for any reason
could end existing agreements and permit the former state of
affairs to reappear. </p>

<hr>

<p> <b>Drugs and Crime</b> </p>

<p> The persistent belief that illicit drug use is inextricably
linked to crime has traditionally been advanced as a reason for
laws and policies against particular drugs. A 1972 survey by the
National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse found that 58
percent of adults believed that marijuana users often commit
crimes they would not have committed had they not used marijuana.
In that same survey, more than 90 percent of those interviewed
believed that, in the commission's words, &quot;Heroin users
often commit crimes to get the money to buy more heroin. -117 </p>

<p> Crimes that relate to illicit drugs can generally be placed
into four categories.&quot;&quot; Two of these are not germane to
this discussion; these are crimes among individuals involved in
the illicit-drug distribution system-e.g., drug or money thefts
by one drug dealer from another-and the crimes of simply using,
possessing, or selling the drug itself, activities which are
criminal by definition, since they are illegal. </p>

<p> Generally, the perceived drug and crime relationship which
most concerns the public falls into two basic categories. The
first category involves the pharmacological effect of a drug on
the user. Historically, the presumed pharmacological connection
between illicit drug use and assaultive crime has been the
impetus behind antidrug laws. However, the evidence to date shows
that alcohol and secobarbital-both legally produced psychoactive
substances-are the drugs most likely to be involved with
subsequent assaultive behavior. There is no substantial evidence
to link the use of any other drug, licit or illicit, with
assaultive crime. Some stimulant drugs, such as the amphetamines,
have reportedly led to aggressive behavior in some individuals,
but there is insufficient evidence to show a causal link between
their use and assaultive crime. </p>

<p> The second category consists of revenue-producing crimes like
burglary, shoplifting, and larceny. More recently, the use of
heroin has been linked to crimes of this sort. The assumption is
that the use of heroin invariably results in addiction; that
heroin addicts require ever-increasing amounts of the drug; and
that, due to the high cost of the drug on the American market,
they must commit various crimes to support their use. As pointed
out by the press and electronic media, the stereotypic portrait
of the heroin user is of a dishevelled, trembling individual
without motivation or legitimate source of income. However, while
there is evidence to suggest that many heroin users may commit
property crimes to support use, 70 nobody really knows how much
crime is actually committed to obtain money to support heroin
habits. Police and court records do not contain this information,
and estimates-which are not particularly reliable-vary, calling
it anywhere from 10 to 50 percent of all revenue-producing
crimes, depending upon the type of offense and the location .71 </p>

<p> A survey by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration of
ten thousand inmates of correctional facilities concluded that 13
percent of the inmates had used heroin at the time of their
arrest. The same survey estimated between 13 and 60 percent of
incarcerated criminals to have been heroin users ' 12 Although
this kind of data suggests links between heroin use and crime,
nothing was established in that survey to demonstrate that these
individuals began to commit crimes because of their heroin use,
nor does the study indicate whether the correctional population
surveyed was typical of all those arrested, or of all committing
crimes. It may indicate a tendency to jail heroin users in
disproportionate numbers. </p>

<p> The studies which indicate that after the onset of opiate
addiction individuals generally increase their criminal activity
come closest to demonstrating a causal link between drug use and
crime .73 These studies suggest that although an individual may
have been a criminal before he used heroin, his heavy use led to
an increase in criminal activity to meet the new income need. On
its face, this implies a connection between heroin use and crime.
However, there is an across-the-board increase in crime among men
between ages eighteen and twenty-five, irrespective of drug use.
74 Thus, any data suggesting increased crime because of heroin
use would have to correct for the general increase in crime for
this age bracket. </p>

<p> The evidence relating to a heroin-crime link could best be
described as showing that regular, heavy opiate use in the United
States probably means a higher rate of revenue-producing crime by
the addict. Because of its broad political appeal, however, this
connection has been repeatedly overstated and even misrepresented
to support tough enforcement policies. For example, Governor
Rockefeller of New York told the legislature, by way of
introducing a &quot;get tough&quot; drug law, that addicts were
&quot;robbing, mugging, murdering day in and day out for their
money to fix their habit. &quot;75 The state estimated that drug
addicts committed a total of $6.5 billion per year in crime. ff
that were in fact the case, it would have meant that these
addicts were committing on the order of 44 million robberies,
muggings, and murders each year in New York to support their
habit, 400 times more than all of the reported crimes in New
York, well beyond any conceivable total of reported and
unreported.crimes in that state .711 </p>

<p> Other data indicate that such figures had little factual
basis. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's 1971 Uniform Crime
Index reported a total of $1.3 billion in theft in 1970 for the
entire nation. Thus, New York State's claim of $6.5 billion in
crime losses for New York alone exceeded the national figure by
five times .77 Another study, an economic analysis by the Hudson
Institute of New York of the extent of heroin use nationwide,
estimated that in 1970 there were 250,000 addicts who were
responsible for a maximum cf $1.7 billion in crime .78 </p>

<p> The New York figures disseminated by Governor Rockefeller's
office were misleading in another important respect. In New York
City, which is generally acknowledged to have more illicit drug
use than any other American city, only a small percentage of the
110,000 reported crimes in 1973 (the year of the
&quot;tougher&quot; New York drug law's passage) were attributed
by police to heroin users. The New York Police Department
estimated only 4.4 percent of those arrested for felonies against
a person-which would include robbery, muggings, and murder-could
be classified as heroin users, and only a small percentage of
those users could be classified as addicts .79 </p>

<p> In a 1974 study by the Crime Analysis Unit of the New York
City Police Department it was found that among arrested criminal
heroin users and nonusers, the 'rates of property crime were
about the same, suggesting that there is little difference in
patterns of property crime between them. However, the percentage
of nonusers who committed serious crimes against a person was
substantially higher than for heroin users.80 A Hudson Institute
study reported even lower figures for assaultive property crimes
among heroin users in New York City. It reported that less than 2
percent supported their heroin use by either robbery or
muggings.81 </p>

<p> These studies call into question the more dramatic statements
about the extent of crime committed by those who use illicit
drugs, particularly heroin. It does seem that property crimes
are. committed by some unknown proportion of regular heavy heroin
users not as a result of the drug itself but of the high cost of
obtaining it in America's black market. Little hard statistical
evidence exists to show a cause-and-effect relationship between
the use of any drug and criminal behavior. </p>

<p> The Impact of Demand and Price. One goal of drug enforcement
is to cut back the supply of heroin and thereby raise the street
price, which in theory will drive heroin addicts into treatment.
This concept has proved to be more unpredictable and complex than
simple cause-and-effect scenarios generally concede. There are
studies which demonstrate that such law enforcement policies may
be a double-edged sword, at least in the short run. </p>

<p> A study of heroin prices in Detroit indicates that as heroin
prices rise because of diminished supply there is a consequent
increase in property crime. The study, performed by the Public
Research Institute of the Center for Naval Analyses noted, </p>

<p> The relationship between drug addiction and criminality is
complex and, because of the lack of data, hard to supply. This
study has shown that the level of property crime in Detroit is in
part affected by the price of heroin. When the price rises, crime
rises. When the price falls, crime falls. This finding supports
the general hypothesis that criminal heroin users as a class try
to maintain their level of consumption in the face of price
increases, and that they rely partly on property crime for the
additional funds. The level of personal crime is little affected
by the price of heroin. 82 </p>

<p> The Detroit study also found that the areas hardest hit by
the crime increases were the poor neighborhoods. It said,
&quot;We have preliminary evidence that poor people are
victimized by addict criminals; thus, law enforcement policies
that tend to raise the price of heroin hurt this income class
.&quot;83 The impact of many national policy shifts is often felt
most acutely in neighborhoods with the least political power;
this phenomenon is particularly profound with drug policies. </p>

<p> The reason why diminished heroin availability may lead to
more crime relates to the economics of the illicit heroin market,
which lies at the raw edge of laissez-faire capitalism. It rests
on the fundamental economic principle of supply and demand: When
the supply is less, the price is more. It should be kept in mind,
however, that supply is but one factor governing the price of
heroin; the purity of the drug and experience of the dealer, as
well as other factors, also affect its price. Supply of the drug
remains, however, one of the strongest single influences on
price. A 1971 East Coast dock strike, for example, is believed
responsible for a temporary heroin shortage and a consequent rise
in street-level prices. After settlement of the strike, supplies
increased and prices dropped, from a high in New York of
sixty-two dollars per gram (for a two-gram purchase at 10 percent
purity) to fifty dollars, all over a period of three months. 84 </p>

<p> The predicted crime increase is of course based on the idea
that if it costs more for a heroin user to support his use and he
has no other income sources than crime, he will need to commit
more crimes to support use at the same level. Also, because many
users support themselves by selling small quantities of drugs
there is the possibility that they could turn to other forms of
crime besides dealing. </p>

<p> The American experience in Vietnam in attempting to eradicate
use of a drug without fully considering the possible consequences
is also instructive. When the army clamped down on marijuana use
the demand for a drug among soldiers who had used it did not
decrease; when they could not get marijuana, they turned in large
numbers to another easily purchased and more easily concealed
drug-heroin. It was a classic example of attempting to control
supply without addressing demand.,&quot;* </p>

<p> *The Vietnam drug experience also underscores other important
points about illicit drug use, i.e., the setting and the
availability. The setting in Vietnam, at once boring and very
dangerous, created a situation which encouraged many individuals
to use drugs there. Also, the fact that drug supplies were so
plentiful contributed to their widespread use. </p>

<p> Despite these occurrences the notion persists that use of
illicit drugs can be brought under control with enforcement
policies, and that bringing it under control will in great
measure solve the crime problem. In part, this notion persists
because of the common stereotype of the heroin user as an
unscrupulous individual willing to commit any crime for his next
fix. Like all stereotypes, it does not encompass the diversity of
the individuals who use drugs compulsively. Many illicit drug
users and opiate addicts hold steady, legitimate jobs. Not all
heroin users are, as previously assumed, heroin
&quot;addicts.&quot; Some, perhaps many, enjoy the euphoric
effects of heroin but do not have a compulsive need for
it.&quot;' Many, perhaps most, of these would not consider
stealing in order to buy their drugs. These occasional heroin
users, sometimes called &quot;chippers,&quot; may, if
mathematical projections are correct, outnumber compulsive heroin
users by as much as six to one. 117 The very notion that they can
exist is frequently met with skepticism because it is contrary to
the well-entrenched belief that to use heroin is to be addicted
to it. </p>

<p> Because heroin users are a diverse group with no uniform
patterns of drug use and widely different ways of earning money,
one cannot simply multiply estimated users by a single monetary
figure to arrive at an accurate estimate of the amount of crime
they commit. It is interesting, however, to speculate on what
might happen to the crime rate if no heroin were available in
this country. The Nixon administration, which like other
administrations before it adopted the conventional assumption of
a direct link between heroin and crime in many of its public
utterances, did not find such a link in a private study it
commissioned. While stating publicly that American drug-related
crime amounted to $18 billion a year, a 1971 White House Domestic
Council decision paper circulated within the Executive Office
noted, &quot;Even if all drug abuse were eradicated, there might
not be a dramatic drop in crime statistics on a national level,
since much crime is not related to drug abuse. -811 </p>

<p> The difficulty of threading through all of the data on drugs
and crime and arriving at any certainties will persist, as will
the unpredictability of the effects of various enforcement
policies. Despite these uncertainties, however, the drug-crime
issue often invokes emotional responses having little to do with
the facts. It is therefore likely that the presumed drug-crime
link will continue to inspire &quot;get tough&quot; approaches to
drug law enforcement in the future. </p>

<hr>

<p> <b>The New York Drug Law</b> </p>

<p> During the early 1970s, a period when the country was greatly
concerned about illicit drugs, New York State embarked on the
strictest &quot;get tough&quot; enforcement approach to illicit
drugs in the country. It is difficult to discern with precision
how much of the zeal for the new law came from an angry and
frustrated citizenry and how much came from the state's leaders,
or how much they coincided. In any case, the new law received
wide national publicity and was passed amid bold promises that it
would squarely address the drug problem in that state. </p>

<p> There was general agreement that the practice of the 1960s of
diverting low-level drug users into treatment and meting out
harsher penalties for higher-level traffickers had largely
failed. New York had heavily committed its resources to
&quot;civil commitment&quot; during the 1960s, a prograin
described -at the time as a model for other states to adopt.
However, 1972 overdose deaths in New York were six times greater
than they had been in 1960; the tougher new laws were regarded by
many as a solution. </p>

<p> The new legislation, which went into effect on September 1,
1973, had two principal objectives. First, it sought to frighten
illicit drug users out of using and drug dealers out of
trafficking. Second, it aimed to reduce crimes commonly
associated with drug addiction, i.e., burglaries, robberies, and
theft; it was believed that potential illicit drug users would be
frightened off by the law and that hardened criminals would be
given long prison sentences, thus reducing the crime rate.119 </p>

<p> The new law was aimed primarily at heroin trafficking, in
particular at the lower-level &quot;street&quot; dealers. The law
divided-heroin dealers into three groups, placed them in the
highest felony category in the state, and required minimum
periods of imprisonment plus mandatory lifetime parole
supervision for each group. The groups were: </p>

<p> I. The highest level dealers. Those who sell one ounce or
more, or possess more than two ounces. These dealers were
subjected to the most severe penalty: a prison sentence of
indefinite length, but with a minimum of between fifteen and
twenty-five years and a lifetime maximum. </p>

<p> II The middle level dealers. Those who sell one-eighth of an
ounce or more, or possess one or two ounces. These offenders were
subjected to prison sentences of indefinite length, with a
minimum term of between six and eight-and-one-third years, and a
lifetime maximum. </p>

<p> III. Street level dealers, also referred to as
&quot;sharer-pushers.&quot; Those who sell less than one-eighth
of an ounce or possess up to an ounce with the intent to sell.
These dealers were made liable to prison sentences of indefinite
length, with a minimum term of between one year and eight-and
one-third years, and a lifetime maximum.110 </p>

<p> The mandatory minimum prison sentences were made a major
provision of the New York law, even though such sentences had
previously been abandoned in federal and state drug laws.
Restrictions on plea bargaining were another controversial aspect
of this law; a person indicted on a low-level felony charge was
not permitted to plead guilty to a misdemeanor, a provision which
eventually led to court congestion and a slowdown of the judicial
process as well as precluding any cooperation of suspects with
police seeking information on higher-level dealers and suppliers.
</p>

<p> New York State became in effect a laboratory in which the
effectiveness of a &quot;get tough&quot; drug law could be
examined. By comparing the drug-related statistics for New York
before and after the new law went into effect, and by examining
similar statistics from neighboring states whose laws had not
changed, comparisons could be drawn and evidence could be
weighed. A study commissioned by the Association of the Bar of
the City of New York to find out the effects of the law concluded
that neither heroin use nor the crime commonly associated with it
declined in New York State as a result of the tough new
legislation. With respect to heroin use, the study found the
following: </p>

<p> Heroin use [in New York City] was as widespread in mid-1976
as it had been when the 1973 revision took effect, and ample
supplies of the drug were available. </p>

<p> The pattern of stable heroin use in New York City between
1973 and mid-1976 was not appreciably different from the average
pattern in other East Coast cities. </p>

<p> The new law may have temporarily deterred heroin use [in New
York City and other New York State jurisdictions]- </p>

<p> There is no evidence of a sustained reduction in heroin use
after 1973 [in New York State as a whole or in upstate New York].
</p>

<p> Most evidence suggests that the illegal use of drugs other
than narcotics in New York City was more widespread in 1976 than
in 1973, and that in this respect New York was not unique among
East Coast cities.&quot; </p>

<p> With respect to crime, the study found: </p>

<p> Serious property crime of the kind often associated with
heroin users increased sharply [in New York State] between 1973
and 1975. The rise in New York State was similar to increases in
nearby states. </p>

<p> There was a sharp rise in non-drug felony crimes between 1973
and 1975 [in New York City]. However, the rise was apparently
unconnected with illegal narcotics use: non-drug felony crimes
known to have been committed by narcotics users remained stable
during that period. </p>

<p> The available evidence suggests that the recidivist
sentencing [predicate felony] provisions of the 1973 law did not
significantly deter prior felony offenders from committing
additional crimes [in New York City].92 </p>

<p> In addition, the study found little enthusiasm for the 1973
law within the criminal justice system. </p>

<p> Many judges and prosecutors felt that the mandatory minimum
sentencing provisions reduced the of individual treatment of
offenders and, therefore, the quality of justice. </p>

<p> Some were troubled because the penalties level drug
traffickers were more severe than those applicable to crimes that
most citizens consider heinous.... New York City prosecutors
tended to believe that the 1973 law was forcing them to scatter
their limited resources on what they considered relatively minor
offenses. (Note: The Class III (lowest level) felony accounted
for 41% of all drug indictments in New York City and 61% of the
trial workload.) ... As for the police, the New York City Police
Department believed that a policy of all-out street level
enforcement would be only marginally productive and would
hopelessly inundate the courts. 93 </p>

<p> Because of the large volume of street-level drug activity in
New York City, the New York City Police Department had the
opportunity to make large numbers of street-level arrests under
the new drug law. It did not elect to do so, for the reason that
past efforts had been perceived as ineffective. As the study
recorded, </p>

<p> In 1969, the Department had implemented a policy similar to
the one implied by the new law. Large numbers of low-level drug
arrests had been encouraged, and the number of felony drug
arrests had risen from 7,199 in 1967 to 26,379 in 1970. In 1971,
however, Police Commissioner Patrick Murphy abandoned this policy
because (a) only a small percentage of the arrests were resulting
in prison or jail sentences and (b) the mass arrest policy did
not appear to be having a significant impact on the drug traffic.
In the Department's view, the mass arrest policy was also
creating serious workload problems for the courts. Immediately
after the change in policy, arrests fell sharply; in 1973, there
were only a little more than one-third as many as two years
earlier.... According to Donald Cawley, New York City Police
Commissioner when the 1973 law became effective, the Department
decided not to change its enforcement policies in response to the
1973 legislation. The Department continued to focus its
enforcement activities on the middle and upper levels of drug
distribution rather than upon street-level drug activity.&quot; </p>

<p> The study concluded, &quot;The key lesson to be drawn from
the experience with the 1973 drug law is that passing a new law
is not enough. What criminal statutes say matters a great deal,
but the efficiency, morale, and capacity of the criminal justice
system is even more of a factor in determining whether the law is
effectively implemented.&quot;95 In addition, the study noted
that implementation of the new law, which included the hiring of
new narcotics case judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and
support staff, cost the state of New York $32 million. </p>

<p> What the study of the New York law indicates is that there
are serious limits to what any law can control. It is apparent
now that the rhetoric which helped create a climate for the new
law-i.e., statements which attributed exaggerated amounts of
crime to drug addicts-was also in part responsible for the
failure of the law to live up to expectations. This is not to
suggest that law enforcement approaches to illicit drug use
should be abandoned because they fail in what they attempt to do.
Rather, it means that our expectations should be realistic,
because our ability to deal with these complex problems is
limited. In New York, administrative problems, court congestion,
the doubts which many judges and prosecutors had about the new
law, and the difficulties of policing illicit drugs under any
circumstances all joined together to reduce the law's
effectiveness. The conclusion is that this law changed very
little in New York. </p>

<hr>

<p> <b>The Impact of Drug Law Enforcement on Drug Using Behavior<br>
</b> </p>

<p> An interesting contrast to the New York &quot;get tough&quot;
law is the Oregon law of 1973 which &quot;decriminalized&quot;
the possession of a small quantity of marijuana. The state took
this action following the recommendations of the National
Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse. The new Oregon law-and
those in other states which subsequently enacted similar
legislation-eliminated the possibility of imprisonment for simple
possession of an ounce or less of marijuana. A civil fine,
similar to a traffic citation, was substituted for the former
criminal penalties. There were to be no criminal arrests for such
offenses nor would there be court arraignment. </p>

<p> Critics of the new law predicted an explosion of both
experimental and regular marijuana use in Oregon. This prediction
was rooted in the persistent belief that it is primarily the law
that restrains people from using illicit drugs-the same view
which in part prompted the tough New York law. </p>

<p> However, annual surveys conducted in Oregon during the four
years following enactment of the new law have shown little change
at all in marijuana use patterns.&quot;&quot; Marijuana users
have increased gradually in number, but this is true across the
nation. Regular users have remained relatively constant, a
pattern that is also typical of other state and national trends. </p>

<p> Since Oregon passed its law, only ten other states have
adopted the reduced penalty for possession of small amounts of
marijuana, despite the preponderance of available evidence that
marijuana is not a major health hazard when used moderately and
that criminal laws apparently do not deter millions from using
it. </p>

<p> The New York law was aimed primarily at heroin, and did
little, if anything, to change use patterns there. The Oregon law
was aimed at marijuana, and it too did little, if anything, to
change use patterns. What both these experiences suggest is just
how little the criminal law influences an individual's decision
to use a particular drug, illegal or not. Similarly, the
prohibition of alcohol in the early part of this century did
little to prevent millions of Americans from consuming it. </p>

<p> These recent legislative developments underscore another
point. Generally, the public and its policymakers have focused
narrowly on eliminating the consumption of one or two drugs in
particular, without giving much thought as to the effect of this
restricted concentration. These policies seem to be based upon
the theory that once marijuana or heroin or cocaine is eliminated
then the problems of drug abuse in the United States will be
solved.<br>
</p>

<p> In 1971 the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA), an
organization established by the joint Chiefs of Staff to develop
independent information and analysis, examined aspects of illicit
drug use in this country. The IDA study concluded that heroin
addicts are probably willing to switch to amphetamines,
barbiturates, and other drugs should heroin become prohibitively
expensive or unavailable .97 Through studies of the urinalysis
screening program of inmates of the Washington, D.C. jails, the
Institute found that before the East Coast dock strike of 1971
nearly 20 percent of the inmates tested positive for opiates.
During the strike, however, this percentage dropped to zero while
that for barbiturate and amphetamine use rose from its former 3
or 4 percent level to nearly 20 percent.,,,, While it is not
conclusive, the study did underscore the fact that we have very
little hard data on the habits, preferences, alternatives, and
attitudes of heroin users. Models, analyses, and other
information offer a limited glimpse of these factors, and then
for only a limited time frame. </p>

<p> This study and other more recent ones&quot;&quot; have
suggested that the usage patterns for heroin may be more flexible
than is generally believed, and therefore less vulnerable to
strategies that focus on the elimination of supply. Although
better domestic enforcement, border control, and foreign
eradication efforts might tighten the heroin market to some
extent, any long-range improvement as regards drug-related
problems remains uncertain. Despite this, and the limited ability
of the criminal justice system to alter human behavior, when laws
fail to discourage an activity' that the majority in a society
deems undesirable the natural impulse is to toughen them to
attain the desired effect.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p> <b><font size="5">Concluding Thoughts<br>
</font></b> </p>

<p> Since federal antinarcotics laws have been in force in this
country for more than sixty years-and local ordinances for more
than a century-it seems appropriate to ask what such laws can or
have accomplished. if we were expecting our drug laws to
eradicate illicit drug use, then the local, state, and federal
antidrug effort must be judged an abject failure. Tough laws have
not been a solution to the drug abuse crisis. If, however, one
was hoping for a containment policy, then enforcement efforts
might be judged a partial success, because only a relatively
small number of people use heroin, the drug with which we seem
most concerned today. This conclusion, of course, is impossible
to prove. Moreover, mere containment of heroin use was never the
stated goal of our drug control efforts. </p>

<p> The best way to judge the value of our present drug control
policies is to weigh their benefits and costs. This may give us
some clues with which to better analyze our current policies and
reach a clearer understanding of their worth. In making this
assessment, it is natural that drug law enforcement be examined
more critically than other approaches, such as treatment or
education. Drug enforcement has received the majority of the
available time, money, technology, and hope and faith for the
past seven decades. It is not unreasonable to say that law
enforcement efforts have been given the greatest possible
opportunity to respond to illicit drugs, and that those efforts
ought to be evaluated in light of their performance. </p>

<p> What then are the costs of drug law enforcement? Several can
be identified: money outlays for enforcement; such side effects
as the stigma of arrest, the risk of impure drugs and associated
health hazards, the creation of a black market, a potential rise
in non-drug crime rates, and the risk of police corruption; the
alienation of many segments of society; selective enforcement
patterns; diversion of scarce resources; erosion of the rule of
law; invasion of privacy; reduction of personal freedom;
hostility between police and the community; and potential police
perjury and official deception. These are some costs generally
ascribed to the current prohibitionist policy approach to
particular drugs. </p>

<p> The benefits are less specific and less provable. We can
point to the arrest of individuals who traffic in illicit drugs
as a benefit, at least in the small percentage of cases where
arrest is followed by conviction and punishment But we cannot
point to drug enforcement generally and argue that it has had a
dramatically successful impact in prohibiting these activities.
One benefit often cited is the channeling into treatment by means
of criminal justice diversion of illicit drug users who might
otherwise not have entered; however, this process may have a
negative impact in deterring voluntary applicants from seeking
help (see Staff Paper 3, &quot;Heroin Treatment&quot;, below).
Law enforcement efforts may also have had an impact in containing
the spread of illicit drug use during years when strong penalties
have been on the books and substantial efforts were made to
enforce those laws. While drug law enforcement efforts
undoubtedly do harass some low-level operatives in the illicit
drug market and make them afraid to deal openly on the street,
this may be a marginal benefit, in that it makes it likely that
users will only become more cautious and harder to detect. While
ease of availability does appear to have some influence on the
numbers who will use a particular drug, making availability
harder does not eliminate the demand for a particular drug or
psychoactive substances generally. </p>

<p> The key question remains: Is the current system of drug
control worthwhile? An abundance of data has been collected-some
of it presented in this chapter-but it is consistently
contradictory, imprecise, of questionable reliability, and laden
with the values we impute to it. Nevertheless, we would conclude
that the costs are greater than the benefits derived. Part of the
difficulty with criminal law as a control measure lies in the
fact that it has been consistently oversold as a cure for illicit
drug use. A serious consequence of this is that drug law
enforcement has rarely been viewed dispassionately; rather, it
has been the object of either heated attack or staunch defense,
and rarely the object of thoughtful analysis. </p>

<p> Our current drug control policies exact a heavy toll in
social costs, while data showing a solid return on the investment
are difficult to find. This imbalance has been known for some
time, but the knowledge of it has not materially changed our drug
control policies and laws. The basic policy established a century
ago continues today, and there are no immediate prospects of the
government, federal or state, seriously reconsidering its heavy
reliance on the criminal justice system to deal with illicit
drugs.<br>

<h1>Psychotic Episodes</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Psychotic Episodes</h2>

<p>What has been referred to as psychotic episodes occurred in 9
subjects, 7 men and 2 women. A description of the happenings in
each instance is given. (2) </p>

<p>(2) Throughout this section fictitious initials are used to
avoid any disclosure of the subjects' identities. </p>

<p>A.V. Male. Non-user. Given 4 cc. of marihuana concentrate.
About three hours later he became restless, tremulous, agitated,
fearful of harmful effects, suspicious of examiners. For short
periods he was euphoric. At one time he had visual hallucinations
of figures making gestures suggesting harm. He talked
continuously, mainly expressing fear. His answers to questions
were delayed but intelligent. </p>

<p>W.P. Male. Occasional user. Given 3 cc., repeated two hours
later. At first there was a euphoric state; later he became
resistant and negativistic. He showed antagonism to the examiner,
demanding to be left alone. He vomited twice. Throughout he was
highly excited and talked to himself. The effects in general
resembled those seen in a maniacal state. He returned to his
normal state in about three hours after the second dose. </p>

<p>F.D. Male. Occasional user. Given 4 cc. Five hours later he
became confused, disoriented and slow in answering questions.
There were periods of elation and depression with laughter and
weeping. The effects passed off in six hours. </p>

<p>R.W. Male. Non-user. Given 5 cc. Three hours later he became
disoriented with continued talkativeness and rapid shifting of
thought. He had fits of laughter and weeping, grandiose ideas,
some paranoid trends. He answered questions clearly but without
perseveration. He returned to normal after six hours. </p>

<p>I.N. Female. Occasional user. Also heroin addict for many
years. Given 8 cc. Three hours later she became confused and
anxious with periods of laughing and weeping. There were several
short episodes resembling hysterical attacks and dyspnea, pallor
and rapid pulse during which she felt that she was dying and
screamed for the doctor and for a priest. Throughout, her
response to questioning was intelligent but delayed. There was a
return to her normal state in three hours. </p>

<p>E.C. Male. Non-user. Given 6 cc. Two hours later he developed
a marked state of anxiety accompanied by a sensation of
difficulty in breathing. This began during a basal metabolism
test. In the Sanborn equipment used there is a nose clip
occluding nasal breathing and a rubber mouthpiece through which
the air is inspired and expired. During the test the subject
became confused, panicky and disoriented as to time. The anxiety
over breathing continued for four hours but could be interrupted
by distraction. He was then given 4 cc. more. The breathing
difficulty lasted five hours more. The condition here had
features seen in claustrophobia. Before the episode, the subject
had taken marihuana on five occasions in 2, 4, 5, 5, and 2 cc.
dosage, without any symptoms of respiratory distress. However,
after the episode he took marihuana on three occasions in 2, 5,
and 6 cc. dosage and each time the respiratory symptoms occurred.
A certain degree of nervousness was present but there was no
mental confusion. The subject realized that there was no physical
obstruction to his breathing and had learned that by
concentrating his thought on other lines he could keep his
respiratory difficulties in abeyance and would not suffer from
real anxiety. Smoking up to as many as thirteen marihuana
cigarettes did not bring about the respiratory effect. It
appeared then that the respiratory symptoms were precipitated by
the wearing of the apparatus while under the influence of
marihuana, and through suggestibility there resulted a
conditioning to the marihuana concentrate which was given
subsequently. </p>

<p>The description of these six psychotic episodes fits in with
many others found in marihuana literature. They are examples of
acute marihuana intoxication in susceptible individuals which
comes on shortly after the drug has been taken and persists for
several hours. </p>

<p>The main features of the poisoning are the restlessness and
mental excitement of a delirious nature with intermittent periods
of euphoric and an overhanging state of anxiety and dread. </p>

<p>Three other subjects presented the features of marihuana
psychosis. </p>

<p>R.H. Male. White. Age 23. Non-user. In prison for the offense
of living on prostitution. The family history was bad. His father
never supported his wife or family and there was continual
discord at home. When the subject was 9 years old the father
deserted the family. Three brothers received court sentences, one
for stealing a taxi, one for rape, and one for striking a
teacher. R.H. was a problem child at school and on account of
truancy and waywardness he was sent to the Flushing Parental
School. </p>

<p>He ran away from this school several times and was transferred
to the House of Refuge on Randall's Island. At the age of 16 he
was discharged. Since that time he had had two jobs, one for
three months in a factory, the other for four and one-half months
in the W.P.A. When he was 16 he was run over by a truck and was
unconscious for a time. After his return to the Riker's Island
Penitentiary from Welfare Hospital further questioning concerning
his past revealed that he was subject to &quot;fits&quot;
occurring once or twice every two months. During the attacks his
body became rigid and his mouth felt stiff. </p>

<p>The subject was admitted to Welfare Hospital for the marihuana
study on February 20th. After the usual program of examinations
he was given 2 cc. of the concentrate on February 27th and
February 28th. These doses brought on the symptoms of dizziness
and tremor and heaviness of the head and the state called
&quot;high&quot; which is characterized by periods of laughter
and talkativeness. These effects passed off in a few hours and
were followed by drowsiness and a sense of fatigue. On March 1st
at 1 p.m. he smoked one marihuana cigarette. Immediately
afterwards he became agitated and restless and suddenly lost
consciousness. He recovered quickly and stated that he had had
visions of angels and had heard choirs singing. Later he had a
second short period of unconsciousness. During the afternoon he
continued to be agitated and restless and had periods of laughing
and weeping. After he was given phenobarbital he went to sleep.
On the next day his only complaint was that he felt dizzy.
Following this episode he was given 4 cc. Of marihuana
concentrate on March 3rd and 2 cc. on March 10th and 2 cc. of
tetrahydrocannabinol on March 5th and 4 cc. on March 8th. The
effects corresponded to those seen after the earlier
administrations of 2 cc. doses of the concentrate. </p>

<p>On March 11th R.H. was given 5 cc. (75 mg.) of the
tetrahydrocannabinol at 11 a.m. and 3 cc. at 2 p.m. No unusual
effects were noted during the afternoon and he ate his supper
with appetite at 4:30 p.m. At 6 p.m. he became restless,
apprehensive and somewhat belligerent. He felt that something had
happened to his mother, that everybody was acting queerly and
picking on him. He continued to be agitated and fearful, refused
medication and slept poorly. This condition persisted and on
March 13th he was returned to Riker's Island. After four days
there he became quiet and composed. The psychotic state cleared
up completely. The resident psychiatrist's report was: Impression
1. Psychosis due to drugs. (Marihuana experimentally
administered.) Acute delirium, recovered. 2. Convulsive disorder,
idiopathic epilepsy. Petit mal on history. </p>

<p>H.W. Female. White. Age 28. Non-user. Drug peddler, serving
three years' indefinite sentence for unlawfully possessing a
drug. Her parents died when she was about 10 years old and she
was raised in an orphanage. At the age of 19 she entered a
training school for nurses, but gave this up after four months
and supported herself by prostitution. Her sister and her
sister's husband were drug addicts and through them she began
taking morphine and heroin, being, according to her account,
depressed and dissatisfied at the time. She continued using these
drugs up to the time of her arrest, a period of eight years. In
1938 she married a man who was also a drug addict, and engaged in
the drug traffic. </p>

<p>On May 7th she was given 2 cc. of marihuana. Aside from a
headache and a feeling of muscular weakness and uncoordination,
the effect was to make the subject feel gay and very good-natured
On May 8th she was given 3 cc. Of the concentrate and became
somewhat confused and unsteady, irritated and upset at carrying
out tests, and greatly worried about the physical symptoms. Five
hours after she had taken the drug the effects had largely passed
off. Six hours later, however, she became restless and agitated,
moving about constantly, and worried about past conduct. This
state continued for a few hours. On other occasions the subject
was given marihuana in doses of 2, 3, and 4 cc. Twice after the
administration of 3 cc. The general effect was of a euphoric
type, and after 4 cc. Had been given a state of sadness set in on
two occasions and one of euphoria on a third. Toward the end of
her stay the subject became depressed and moody, constantly
dwelling on the belief that she had committed unpardonable sins. </p>

<p>She was returned to the House of Detention on June 2nd,
transferred to the Psychiatric Division of Bellevue Hospital on
June 9th, and from there was sent to Matteawan State Hospital on
July 10th. On admission to the State Hospital she appeared
confused, retarded, apprehensive, and depressed. She had a marked
feeling of guilt. She began to improve in September and was
discharged, cured, in January. Since her return to New York she
reports at frequent intervals to the parole officer. She has
secured employment in a food shop and is to be promoted to the
position of manager of the shop. </p>

<p>The diagnosis made at the State Hospital was: Psychosis, due
to drugs and other exogenous poisons (morphine and heroin). </p>

<p>D.P. Male. Colored. Age 23. Occasional user. Sentenced for
unlawful possession of drugs. Since graduation from high school
at the age of 16 he had had no occupation. His criminal record
dated from his graduation. He was arrested in 1934 for disorderly
conduct and in the same year sentenced to Elmira Reformatory for
five years for second-degree assault. He was paroled in 1936, but
during the same and the following year was arrested three times
for assault or robbery. He was returned to Elmira where he
remained until his discharge in 1940. In August 1940 he was
arrested for the possession of drugs and sentenced to a
three-year indefinite term. He had served eight months of this
sentence when he was admitted to Welfare Hospital as a subject
for the marihuana study. </p>

<p>During his stay at Welfare Hospital, D.P. was given marihuana
in the form of a concentrate and as cigarettes on numerous
occasions. His symptoms and behavior corresponded to those
usually seen, lasting a few hours with no after-effects. When the
time came for his return to Riker's Island he urged that he be
allowed to stay at the hospital and assist in the study. Two
weeks after his return to the penitentiary he developed a
psychosis characteristic of schizophrenia. He was transferred to
Matteawan where the diagnosis made was: Psychosis with
psychopathic personality. </p>

<p>These three cases are of special interest from the standpoint
of the relationship of marihuana to the psychosis. The first
subject, R.H., had a definite history of epileptic attacks. After
smoking one marihuana cigarette he experienced an acute
confusional state which lasted a few hours. In the second episode
which lasted six days there was a more prolonged confusional
state. Epileptics are subject to such attacks, epileptic or
epileptic equivalents, which may be brought on by any number of
upsetting circumstances. In this case marihuana is the only known
factor which precipitated the attack. </p>

<p>The second subject, H.W., was a heroin addict of long
standing. During her stay in the hospital, in her retrospective
reports on her marihuana experiences there were usually included
expressions of worry and remorse at her failure to answer
questions or perform tests honestly, informing on the other women
in her group, and denials concerning a syphilitic infection she
thought she had had. Prior to this incarceration she had had no
prison experience. The mental picture developed from the study at
the hospital and at Matteawan and the subject's subsequent
history represent a fairly typical example of what is termed a
prison psychosis. </p>

<p>The third subject, D.P., did not develop his psychosis until
two weeks after he had been returned to the Riker's Island
Penitentiary. He had shown no unexpected effects from marihuana
and had hoped to be allowed to stay on at the hospital instead of
going back to prison to complete more than two years of an
unexpired sentence. At Matteawan this subject was considered to
have an underlying psychopathic personality. His case also may be
taken as an example of prison psychosis. With both the second and
third subjects, the exact role of marihuana in relation to the
psychosis cannot be stated. </p>

<p>Dr. Peter F. Amoroso, Commissioner of Correction of the city
of New York, has given us information concerning the prisoners
sentenced to the penitentiary at Riker's Island from whom our
subjects were drawn. During the year beginning July 1, 1941, and
ending June 30, 1942, there were 1,756 inmates in this
institution. They had received an indeterminate sentence, that
is, from a minimum of a few months to a maximum of three years.
Of this group, 175 were subjected to intensive study by the
psychiatrist because they were considered possible psychotic
cases, 117 were sex offenders, and 200 were miscellaneous cases
referred for mental observation, making a total of 492.
Twenty-seven of these cases were committed to state institutions
for the criminal insane, namely, 25 to Matteawan and 2 to
Dannemora. </p>

<p>Commissioner Amoroso, after reviewing these cases, writes as
follows: </p>

<p>&quot;The prison atmosphere may place a most severe strain on
those who are physically or mentally abnormal upon commitment . .
. Emotionally unstable persons find themselves during
incarceration denied the assertion and enjoyment of the basic
human urges and impulses and it is natural to expect, therefore,
that prison life may result in various types of explosions, such
as psychoses, neuroses, sex perversion, and even physical and
moral deterioration.' </p>

<p>&quot;I am indeed surprised that we had so little trouble with
our volunteers upon completion of their study and sojourn at
Welfare Hospital, and the few psychotic episodes that occurred
are exactly what we would expect in the whole group without
considering the administration and effects of excessive doses of
marihuana.&quot; </p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In the study of the actions of marihuana in respect to
subjective and objective symptoms and behavior, the marihuana was
given a number of times to each of the subjects in the form of
the concentrate taken by stomach. The amount given ranged from 2
to 22 cc., in most cases from 2 to 5 cc. After marihuana was
taken, the systematic action became evident in from one- half to
one hour and the maximum effects were seen in from two to three
hours. They passed off gradually, usually in from three to five
hours, although in some instances they did not completely
disappear until twelve or more hours. </p>

<p>Of the symptoms occurring, a feeling of lightness in the head
with some dizziness, a sensation of floating in the air, dryness
of the throat, hunger and thirst, unsteadiness and heaviness in
the extremities were the most frequent. Tremor and ataxia,
dilation of the pupils and sluggishness in responsiveness to
light were observed in all subjects. </p>

<p>From observations on the behavior and responses of the
subjects, it was found that a mixture of euphoria and
apprehension was generally present. If the subjects were
undisturbed there was a state of quiet and drowsiness, and
unawareness of surroundings, with some difficulty in focusing and
sustaining mental concentration. If they were in company,
restlessness, talkativeness, laughter and joking were commonly
seen. A feeling of apprehension, based on uncertainty regarding
the possible effects of the drug and strengthened by any
disagreeable sensations present, alternated with the euphoria. If
the apprehension developed into a state of real anxiety, a spirit
of antagonism was shown. However, any resistance to requests made
to the subjects was passive and not physical and there was no
aggressiveness or violent behavior observed. Erotic ideas or
sensations when present took no active expression. </p>

<p>Six of the subjects developed toxic episodes characteristic of
acute marihuana intoxication. The dosage varied from 4 to 8 cc.
of the concentrate, and the episodes lasted from three to six
hours, in one instance ten hours. The effects were mixtures of
euphoric and anxiety states, laughter, elation, excitement,
disorientation and mental confusion. </p>

<p>The doses given were toxic to the individuals in question but
not to others taking the same or larger ones. Once the drug had
been taken the effects were beyond the subject's control. The
actions described took unusual expression because for the
particular subject at a particular time the dose was unusually
effective. A corresponding toxicity did not occur from cigarettes
for here the effects came on promptly and on the appearance of
any untoward effects, the smoking was stopped. </p>

<p>In three of the subjects a definite psychotic state occurred,
in two shortly after marihuana ingestion, in one after a two week
interval. Of the first two, one was an epileptic and the other
had a history of heroin addiction and a prepsychotic personality.
The third was considered a case of prison psychosis. The
conclusion seems warranted that given the potential personality
make-up and the right time and environment, marihuana may bring
on a true psychotic state. <br>

<font size="2">The Pharmacology of Consciousness-altering Drugs</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Altered States of Consciousness, Drugs, and
Society <br>
<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>THE PHARMACOLOGY OF
CONSCIOUSNESS</i>-<i>ALTERING DRUGS <br>
</i></font></p>

<p><font size="2">The single most important fact to emerge from
research on consciousness-altering drugs in this century is that
individual responses to them result from set and setting as much
as from the drug itself. Occasionally particular combinations of
set and setting completely reverse the &quot;pharmacological
action&quot; of a drug as described in a text on pharmacology.
For example, with proper suggestion and in a restful setting,
amphetamines can produce sedation. Drug, set, and setting,
therefore, appear to be interdependent in shaping drug responses;
no one factor seems vastly more determining than any other.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">This principle is logical enough. No
physiological event takes place without a corresponding event in
the central nervous system. Therefore, every &quot;bodily&quot;
response is actually a psychosomatic response. In the case of
medical drugs like digitalis and atropine, no one is very much
interested in the psychic component of response, so that we have
come to think of these substances as producing constant
physiological responses (although there is still enough variation
from patient to patient to make their clinical administration a
ticklish business). In the case of &quot;psychoactive&quot; drugs
like heroin and LSD, the psychic component of response becomes
the focus of attention; but, because we do not understand it
according to present models of consciousness, we try in vain to
make these drugs, too, fit our simplistic conceptions of
pharmacology. How nice it would be if we could derive a method of
predicting an individual's response to a psychoactive drug from
purely pharmacological considerations. But we cannot do so.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Two upsetting conclusions follow from this line
of reasoning: First, it is impossible to talk meaningfully about
the effects of psychoactive drugs, except by reference to their
effects on specific individuals on specific occasions; and
secondly, pharmacology is not a useful approach to understanding
the effects of these drugs either on individuals or on society. A
pharmacologist, of course, would disagree with me, but his view
of things would be as biased in its own way as that of the
law-enforcement officer who favors continued efforts to stop
people from using drugs by means of the criminal law. Most of
what is written about LSD and heroin in pharmacology texts is
meaningless in this sense: It says nothing about what will happen
to you if you take LSD at eight o'clock tonight; gives you no
power to help me if I come to you for assistance in breaking a
heroin habit; and is quite irrelevant to any considerations of
what the United States ought to do about the continuing increase
in negative use of these drugs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">What we need is a new science of consciousness,
based on subjective experience rather than on objective
physiology. The materialistic psychology that has dominated
Western thought about consciousness is no longer adequate to the
task of explaining the mind in terms that are useful to us. (An
especially galling aspect of the drug problem for the medical
profession is that psychologically ignorant users of drugs appear
to have more practical information about their effects than
doctors have.) I predict that, from an experiential viewpoint,
many unifying principles of drug states will become visible. In
the pharmacological model, there is some unity; for example,
alcohol, barbiturates, and minor tranquilizers are grouped
together as sedative-hypnotics-a useful grouping, because it
alerts us to the danger that drugs like chlordiazepoxide
(Librium) and meprobamate (Equanil) produce a dependence
resembling dependence on alcohol. But pharmacology offers no clue
why the psychological changes of a marijuana high have much in
common with those of an LSD trip, or why heroin users may be able
to satisfy their need for a certain experience by inhaling
nitrous oxide, a general anesthetic.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In the following pages, I will review briefly
what is known and what is not known about the major
pharmacological classes of psychoactive drugs-briefly, because,
in view of the limited usefulness of this scheme of
classification, it is not worth discussing, except at the most
general level. <br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">SEDATIVE-HYPNOTICS <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Alcohol and the barbiturates are associated
with stubborn forms of drug dependence, marked by relatively
constant, doserelated physiological changes, some of which become
irreversible over time. These changes include tolerance (probably
the clinical correlate of the induction of degradative enzymes in
the liver) and withdrawal (a syndrome that persists until
metabolism readjusts to its predrug state). Unlike narcotics,
alcohol and barbiturates cause life-threatening reactions when
they are withdrawn from addicted persons. Chronic use of
sedative-hypnotics is associated with structural damage to the
nervous system; this association is stronger than for any of the
other classes of drugs discussed below. Alcoholism is
particularly associated with chronic liver disease, possibly
because alcohol is directly toxic to liver cells. Barbiturates
are often implicated in accidental selfpoisonings, because
tolerance to the lethal dose does not develop as fast as
tolerance to the hypnotic dose. The minor tranquilizers have been
promoted as anti-anxiety agents, but they behave just like mild
sedative-hypnotics.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Most persons use sedative-hypnotics to reduce
anxiety by substituting a &quot;high&quot; state of consciousness
that permits sleep, relaxation, or the mild disinhibition valued
in certain social encounters.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">These drugs are associated with dependence
because (1) they do not affect the source of anxiety; (2) the
development of tolerance encourages more and more frequent use;
(3) their use in our culture is strongly linked to destructive
(especially self destructive) behavior patterns; and (4) people
in our society do not know how to make use of altered states of
consciousness.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The pharmacological model of- these drugs
offers no hope of cure or prevention of dependence on
sedative-hypnotics. It can, however, offer treatment of acute
toxic episodes and withdrawal reactions. It seems unlikely that
elucidation of the exact metabolic derangements underlying
dependence will open the way to any pharmacological means of
intervening in the course of the disease.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Nothing important is known about the action of
these drugs on the mind. Since their major action is depression
of neurological activity in the central nervous system, it has
been assumed that the &quot;paradoxical stimulation&quot;
observed with low doses (the high that precedes the stupor of
alcohol intoxication) is the result of inhibition of inhibitory
brain centers (which are conveniently postulated to respond to
lower doses). However, some researchers have suggested that low
doses may have direct excitatory action on nerve cells. That this
kind of debate should still be going on in 1970 suggests how far
we are from understanding conscious experience in physiological
terms. (If alcohol intoxication were looked at by an experiential
science of consciousness, it might turn out that the high is not
causally related to the drug, which might be a pure depressant,
after all.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It is ironic that we have chosen our one
sanctioned intoxicant from this class of drugs. In no other class
is pharmacological action (in this case, on liver and nerve-cell
metabolism) so clearly related to long-range physiological
deterioration.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">NARCOTICS<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Like sedative-hypnotics, narcotics are central
depressants that produce stubborn dependence. Unlike
sedative-hypnotics, they are not directly associated with
long-range physiological damage or life-threatening withdrawal
reactions. Tolerance to narcotics develops faster than tolerance
to sedative-hypnotics; hence, visible dependence develops faster.
Because narcotics are illegal, their use is much more bound up
with antisocial, negative, and, often, self-destructive behavior.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Addiction&quot; to and
&quot;withdrawal&quot; from narcotics have become stereotypes in
the public mind, but reality does not often conform to these
conceptions. Far from being a physiological constant, dependent
on dose and frequency of administration of a drug, the physical
craving for narcotics is very much a matter of set and setting.
Some individuals, when they find tolerance appearing, work out a
method of spacing injections of heroin so that they never become
really &quot;hooked,&quot; even though they use the drug
regularly for years. (The number of such persons is unknown but
may be greater than the number of hooked addicts; they often lead
stable lives and may never come to the attention of groups
concerned with narcotics.) Other people seem not to be able to
handle the development of tolerance and quickly go on to
experience strong physiological dependence. Similarly, withdrawal
reactions from narcotics are strongly shaped by
nonpharmacological factors. In a supportive setting with strong
positive suggestion, a heroin addict can undergo comfortable
withdrawal with no medication other than aspirin.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Narcotics do not affect the primary reception
of pain or other sensory stimuli; rather, they alter secondary
perception. A person in pain, given morphine, might say,
&quot;The pain is still there, but it doesn't bother me.&quot; In
other words, the pain is perceived through an altered state of
consciousness. Pharmacological research on narcotics has been
unproductive. In the first place, no real success has been
achieved in separating the analgesic and addicting properties of
this class of compounds. Secondly, the metabolic changes
accompanying narcotics dependence are beyond our present
understanding; even if they were understood, there is no reason
to think our difficulties with addiction would be any fewer.
Thirdly, no purely pharmacological method of controlling
addiction has come along.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The problems associated with heroin (death from
overdose; hepatitis; crime; mental and physical deterioration)
appear to have no causal relationship to the pharmacological
action of the drug. Rather, they correlate better with features
of the social context in which heroin exists in our country. In
fact, the discrepancy between pharmacology and experience is best
illustrated by phenomena accompanying dependence on drugs of this
class.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="1">AMPHETAMINES AND RELATED DRUGS <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Drugs that stimulate the central and
sympathetic nervous systems include the amphetamines (a chemical
class), several drugs that are chemically but not
pharmacologically distinct from the amphetamines (like
methylphenidate-Ritalin; and phemnetrazine-Preludin) , and
cocaine. These drugs cause the release of norepinephrine from
adrenergic nerve endings. Tolerance to them develops very
quickly, but withdrawal from them, although sometimes a
psychological ordeal, has few physiological accompaniments in
contrast to withdrawal from sedative-hypnotics or narcotics.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Little is known about the neurological
consequences of chronic, heavy use of amphetamines. Speed freaks
who take enormous doses of amphetamines intravenously develop a
paranoid psychosis that looks suspiciously organic and may be
correlated with depletion of the body's stores of norepinepbrine.
(It may just as well be correlated with the prolonged wakefulness
induced by these drugs.) To date, there is no firm evidence of
actual neurological deterioration resulting from any of these
drugs, including cocaine. Although low doses do not change eating
behavior in most people (contrary to the claims of
pharmaceutical-industry advertising), very high doses do shut off
the hypothalamic hunger center and can result in severe
malnutrition. The high incidence of hepatitis among amphetamine
users has led to speculation that the drug may be directly toxic
to liver cells. (If this hepatitis is, indeed, chemical, it may
also be due to a common contaminant of black-market methadrine.)</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Until recently, amphetamine dependence was
considered less serious than narcotic dependence, because it was
&quot;Iess<b> </b>physiological.&quot; In fact, however,
amphetamine dependence is more serious, because it is inherently
less stable. When a person begins to use a tolerance-producing
drug, he must soon face the problem of trying to stabilize his
use in order to keep his life from being disrupted. More than any
other class of drugs, the amphetamines foil a user's attempt to
reach equilibrium with his habit, because they induce such
powerful and unrelenting tolerance. Consequently, users develop
erratic patterns of use, such as &quot;spree shooting&quot; and
alternation with barbiturates and, eventually, with heroin. The
high correlation of amphetamine use with impulsive and violent
behavior is consistent with this pharmacological instability.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Abusive oral use of diet pills may be
associated with serious psychological problems but is not
accompanied by the physical changes associated with intravenous
use.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">HALLUCINOGENS<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Hallucinogens stimulate the central and
sympathetic nervous systems (some are simple derivatives of
amphetamine) but, in addition, induce perceptual changes and the
kinds of mental states associated with trance, mystic rapture,
and psychosis. Except for the visual hallucinations (in
particular, the everchanging, geometric patterns seen on
surfaces), most of these effects are common in altered states of
consciousness unrelated to drugs. The hallucinogens differ from
one another only in duration of action and in relative prominence
of stimulant versus psychic effects. Pharmacological research
tells us little more about them than about the amphetamines; it
offers no satisfactory explanation for the effects of
hallucinogens on consciousness. No one takes these drugs
frequently enough to get into pharmacological trouble with them.
(Tolerance is so rapid that regular consumption is impractical;
you can't stay high on LSD for too long at one stretch.)
Therefore, the pharmacological body of data is quite irrelevant
to our understanding of the difficulties people get into with
hallucinogens. Also, there is no indication that use of these
drugs is associated with physical damage of any kind, in either
short- or long-term use.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Most bad trips on hallucinogens are
nonpharmacological panic reactions. Others are nonspecific toxic
psychoses-overdose reactions that disappear when the drug wears
off.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">MARIJUANA<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Marijuana differs from the hallucinogens in two
ways: It does not cause hallucinations, and it is not a
stimulant. In fact, marijuana has virtually no significant
pharmacological actions, which probably accounts for its
popularity. It provides a high with minimal physiological
accompaniment, so that people who are anxious about it can easily
pretend to themselves that they have done nothing to their bodies
or minds. For the same reason, it is useless to study marijuana
in the pharmacological laboratory, because there is no
physiological handle on the phenomenon under consideration.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Except for the possibility of lung disease
related to chronic inhalation of the drug, there is no evidence
that marijuana is physically harmful in short- or long-term
usage. No other drug is like marijuana in having so few
physiological effects. For this reason, it seems wise to think of
marijuana as a class unto itself, no more closely related to the
hallucinogens than to the sedative hypnotics. Its unique chemical
structure is consistent with this idea.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">TOXINS, </font><font size="1">GENERAL
ANESTHETICS, AND SPECIAL SUBSTANCES</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Persons who enjoy the altered state of
consciousness called delirium (actually, a nonspecific response
of the brain to a toxin) will occasionally induce it by inhaling
volatile solvents and petroleum distillates such as glue.
Repeated use of defiriants appears to be correlated with
structural damage to the central nervous system. In addition,
petroleum distillates are frequently toxic to the liver,
especially when taken with alcohol. Delirium is characterized by
confusion, disorientation, and hallucination; it is sometimes
called &quot;acute brain syndrome&quot; or &quot;toxic
psychosis,&quot; and it can also occur in response to overdoses
of any of the classes of drugs mentioned above, including
marijuana.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">General anesthesia is an altered state of
consciousness induced by a heterogenous class of chemicals, some
of which (ether and nitrous oxide) are occasionally taken for
nonmedical purposes. It is instructive to reflect that no
satisfactory theory has been proposed thus far to explain general
anesthesia in pbarmacological or neurophysiological terms, even
though millions of persons have been put into this state under
close observation. Because the psychic phenomena of general
anesthesia can be reproduced nonchemically (by hypnosis, for
example), it is tempting to speculate that this altered state of
consciousness, too, would be better understood from the point of
view of subjective experience rather than from the point of view
of objective pharmacology.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Drug users who are deprived of their usual
drugs sometimes resort to special substances like nutmeg and
morning-glory seeds to get high. Many natural products of very
diverse pharmacology have been so employed, and it seems likely
that set and setting determine whether they produce pleasant
altered states of consciousness, sickness, or, indeed, no effects
at all.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>ALTERED STATES OF
CONSCIOUSNESS,</i></font> </p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>DRUGS, AND SOCIETY <br>
</i></font></p>

<p><font size="2">The general thesis of this paper is that drug
experience can be understood only if it is viewed as an altered
state of consciousness rather than as a pharmacological event. A
subthesis is that this approach will make it possible for society
to reduce significantly the problems now associated with the use
of psychoactive drugs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">All of us experience occasional states of
consciousness different from our ordinary waking state.
Obviously, sleep is such a state. Less obviously, perhaps, are
daydreaming and movie watching unusual modes of awareness. Other
distinct varieties of conscious states are trance, hypnosis,
psychosis, general anesthesia, delirium, meditation, and mystic
rapture. In our country, until recently, there has been no
serious investigation of altered states of consciousness as such,
because most Western scientists who study the mind regard
consciousness as annoyingly nonmaterial and, therefore,
inaccessible to direct investigation. Their research has focused
on the objective correlates of consciousness instead of on
consciousness itself. In the East, on the other hand, where
nonmateriality is not seen as a bar to direct investigation, much
thought has been devoted to altered states of consciousness, and
a science of consciousness based on subjective experience has
developed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would make sense to study all forms of
nonordinary consciousness together, because they seem to have
much in common. For example, trance, whether spontaneous or
induced by a hypnotist, is in many ways simply an extension of
the daydreaming state in which a person's awareness is focused
and directed inward rather than outward. Except for its voluntary
and purposeful nature, meditation is not easily distinguishable
from trance. Zen masters warn their meditating students to ignore
makyo-sensory distortions that often take the form of visions
seen by mystics in rapturous states or hallucinations similar to
those of schizophrenics. And, curiously, the state of being high
on drugs shares many characteristics with these other forms of
altered consciousness, regardless of what drug induces the high.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">It is my contention that the desire to alter
consciousness is an innate psychological drive arising out of the
neurological structure of the human brain. Strong evidence for
this idea comes from observations of very young children, who
regularly use techniques of consciousness alteration on
themselves and one another when they think no adults are watching
them. These methods include whirling until vertigo and collapse
ensue, hyperventilating and then having another child squeeze
one's chest to produce unconsciousness, and being choked around
the neck to cause fainting. Such practices appear to be
universal, irrespective of culture, and present at ages when
social conditioning is unlikely to be an important influence (for
example, in two- and three-year-olds). Psychiatrists have paid
little attention to these common activities of children. Freud,
who did note them, called them &quot;sexual
equivalents&quot;-which they may be, although that formulation is
not very useful for our purposes.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">As children grow older, they soon learn that
experiences of the same sort may be had chemically-for instance,
by inhaling the fumes of volatile solvents found around the
house. General anesthesia is another chemically induced altered
state of consciousness that many children are exposed to in their
early years. (The current drug-using generation was extensively
tonsillectomized, by the way.) Until a few years ago, most
children in our society who wanted to continue indulging in these
states were content to use alcohol, the one intoxicant we make
available legally. (Incidentally, there are some good reasons
that alcohol may not be a wise choice for sole legal
intoxicant-apart from its devastating medical effects.) Now,
large numbers of young people are seeking chemical alterations of
consciousness through a variety of illegal and medically
disapproved drugs. It is possible to see this change as primarily
a reaction to other social upheavals-and, certainly, much has
been written about the social causes of drug use. It may be more
useful, however, to consider what many drug users themselves say:
They choose illegal drugs over alcohol in order to get better
highs. There is no question that social factors influence the
forms of drug use in a society, or that changes in patterns of
use of intoxicants go along with major cultural upheavals, but we
must remember that every culture throughout history has made use
of chemicals to alter consciousness.* Instead of looking for
explanations of drug taking in a foreign war or in domestic
tension, therefore, perhaps we should pay more careful attention
to how we allow people to satisfy chemically their innate drive
to experience other states of awareness.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Most societies, like our own, are uncomfortable
about having people go off into trances, mystic raptures, and
hallucinatory intoxications. Indeed, the reason we have laws
against possession of drugs in the first place is to discourage
people from getting high. But innate, neuropsychological drives
cannot be banned by legislation. They will be satisfied at any
cost. And the cost in our country is very great, for, by trying
to deny young people these important experiences, we maximize the
probability that they will obtain them in negative ways-that is,
in ways harmful to themselves and to society.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Why are altered states of consciousness
important? Primarily because they seem to be doorways to the next
stages of evolutionary development of the human nervous system.
We commonly assume that a major division of our nervous system
(the autonomic system) is involuntary-beyond our conscious
control -and that this leaves us open to many kinds of illnesses
we can do nothing about (for example, cardiovascular diseases).
Yet, hypnotized subjects often show an astonishing degree of
autonomic control, to the extent of developing authentic blisters
when touched with cold objects represented to them as being red
hot. And Yogis frequently demonstrate voluntary control of heart
action and blood flow that astonishes physicians; they themselves
ascribe their successes to regular periods of meditative effort,
asserting that there is no limit to what consciousness can effect
through the &quot;involuntary&quot; nervous system. In addition,
creative genius has long been observed to correlate well with
psychosis, and much of the world's highest religious and
philosophic thought has come out of altered states of
consciousness.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">At the very least, altered states of
consciousness appear to have potential for strongly positive
psychic development. Most Americans do not get the chance to
exploit this potential, because their society gives them no
support. The prevailing attitude toward psychosis is
representative. We define this experience as a disease, compel
people who have it to adopt the role of sick, disabled patients,
and then ply them with special kinds of sedatives that we call
&quot;antipsychotic agents&quot; but that simply make it hard for
them to think and to express their altered state of consciousness
in ways disturbing to the staffs of psychiatric hospitals. The
individual learns from early childhood to be guilty about, or
afraid of, episodes of nonordinary awareness and is forced to
pursue antisocial behavior patterns if he wants to continue
having such episodes. Negative drug taking has become a popular
form of this kind of behavior.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I implied earlier that alcohol may not fulfill
the need for alteration of consciousness as well as other drugs.
Like all psychoactive drugs, it does induce a high with positive
potential. (A vast body of prose, poetry, and song from all ages
testifies to this &quot;good side&quot; of alcohol.) The trouble,
however, is that an alcohol high is difficult to control; in
drinking, one slips easily into the dose range where the effects
become unpleasant (nausea, dizziness, uncoordination) and
interfere with mental activity. Marijuana, on the other hand,
maintains a &quot;useful&quot; high over an extremely wide dose
range and allows a remarkable degree of control over the
experience. But, as with other drugs, set and setting determine
the effects of marijuana by interacting with the drug's<b> </b>pharmacological
action. Unfortunately, current social factors create strongly
negative sets and settings, thus increasing the likelihood that
users will be drawn into the negative side of consciousness
alteration instead of being encouraged to explore its positive
potential. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">By focusing our attention on drugs rather than
on the states of consciousness people seek in them, we develop
notions that lead to unwise behavior. Users who think that highs
come from joints and pills rather than from their own nervous
systems get into trouble when the joints and pills no longer work
so well (a universal experience among regular consumers of all
drugs) : Their drug use becomes increasingly neurotic-more and
more frequent and compulsive with less and less reward. In fact,
this misconception is the initial step in the development of drug
dependence, regardless of whether the drug is marijuana or
heroin, whether it produces physiological dependence or not. And
dependence cannot be broken until the misconception is
straightened out, even though the physiological need is
terminated. (Hence the failure of methadone to cure addicts of
being addicts.) By contrast, a user who realizes that he has been
using the drug merely as a trigger or excuse for having an
experience that is a natural and potentially valuable element of
human consciousness comes to see that the drugged state is not
exactly synonymous with the experience he wants. He begins to
look for ways to isolate the desired aspect of the chemically
induced state and often finds that some form of meditation will
satisfy his desire to get high more effectively. One sees a great
many experienced drug takers give up drugs for meditation, but
one does not see any meditators give up meditation for drugs.
This observation has led some drug educators to hope that young
people can be encouraged to abandon drugs in favor of systems
like the transcendental meditation of Maharishi Mahesh. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Society labors under the same delusions as
dependent users. It thinks that problems come from drugs rather
than from people. Therefore, it tries to stop people from using
drugs or to make drugs disappear rather than to educate people
about the &quot;right&quot; use of drugs. No drug is inherently
good or evil; all have potential for positive use, as much as for
negative use. The point is not to deny people the experience of
chemically altered consciousness but to show them how to have it
in forms that are not harmful to themselves or to society. And
the way to do that is to recognize the simple truth that the
experience comes from the mind, not from the drug. (Once you have
learned from a drug what being high really is, you can begin to
reproduce such state without the drug; all persons who accomplish
this feat testify that the nonpharmacological high is superior.)
Ironically, society's efforts to stop drug abuse are the very
factors causing drug abuse. There really is no Drug Problem at
all, rather a Drug-Problem Problem. And it will continue growing
until we admit that drugs have a positive potential that can be
realized.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Many non-Western societies have experimented
with this alternative. The primitive Indian tribes of the Amazon
basin, for example, make free use of drugs but have no problems
of abuse. That is, although these groups use a multitude of
hallucinogenic barks seeds, and leaves, no one takes the drugs to
express hostility toward society, to drop out of the social
process, to rebel against his parents or teachers, or to hurt
himself. These Indians admit that their world contains substances
that alter consciousness; they do not try to make them go away or
to prevent theiruse. They accept the fact that people, especially
children, seekout altered states of consciousness. And, rather
than attempt to deny their children experiences they know to be
important, they allow them to have them under the guidance of
experts in such matters, usually the tribal shamans. Recognizing
that drugs have potential for harm, the shaman surrounds their
use with ritual and conveys the rationale of this ritual to his
charges. Furthermore, the states of consciousness induced by
drugs in these remote areas are used for positive ends, and are
not just lapsed into out of boredom or frustration. Some drugs
are used only by shamans, for communing with the spirit world or
for diagnosing illness; others are used by adolescents in
coming-of-age rites; still others are consumed by the whole tribe
as recreational intoxicants on special occasions.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I am not suggesting that we return to a
primitive life in the jungle, but I do think we have much to
learn from these Amazonian peoples. One reason we are so locked
into wrong ways of thinking about drugs is that no one can see a
goal worth working for, only problems to work against. The Indian
model is an ideal -not something to be substituted overnight for
our present situation, but something to be kept in mind as the
direction to move toward. Let me list the three chief features of
this ideal system as proposals for our own society:<i> <br>
</i></font></p>

<p><font size="2"><i>1. Recognition of the importance of altered
states of consciousness and the existence of a normal drive to
experience them. </i>There is a considerable lack of
enlightenment in scientific circles concerning the nature of
consciousness, in both its ordinary and its nonordinary forms,
and there would doubtless be resistance from the professional
community to these propositions. But, because consciousness is,
above all, a matter of inner experience, most laymen are quite
willing to accept these ideas. Many adults have simply forgotten
their childhood experiences with altered states of consciousness
and recall them vividly as soon as they try to. Therefore, I
think the possibilities for re-education are good.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">As thinking about drugs moves in this
direction, society will become less and less inclined to try to
frustrate the human need for periods of altered awareness, so
that the role of the criminal law in this area should diminish.
At the same time ' there may be a culmination of the present
efforts of younger scientists to bring the study of altered
states of consciousness into the &quot;respectable&quot;
disciplines and institutions. A very great body of information
exists on these states; it simply needs collecting and arranging,
so that we can begin to correlate it with what we know
objectively about the nervous system.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><i>2. Provision for the experience of altered
states of consciousness in growing children. </i>Rather than
drive children to seek out these states surreptitiously, we must
aim to do as the Indians do: let children learn by experience
under the watchful guidance of an elder. &quot;Drug
education&quot; in the United States means thinly disguised
attempts to scare children away from drugs. True education would
let those who wanted to explore consciousness do so without guilt
and with adult support and supervision. Such explorations should
include drug experience, because drugs are legitimate tools for
altering awareness. Because they have a potential for negative
use, they cannot be used wantonly but must be used in certain
prescribed ways, at certain times, and for certain purposes.
Thus, we must develop a &quot;ritual&quot; for drug experience
analogous to the Indian tribal rituals. We will also need analogs
of the shamans-persons who, by virtue of their own experience
with altered states of consciousness, are qualified to supervise
the education of the young.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><i>3. Incorporation of the experience into
society for positive ends. </i>It is not enough that we come to
tolerate alterations of consciousness. We must put them to use
for the good of individuals and society. We have come to think of
drug experience as an escape from reality; but, if it is so in
our society, we have made it so. People who can openly and
purposefully spend time away from ordinary consciousness seem
superior when they function <b>in </b>ordinary consciousness.
They are healthier, both physically and mentally; they lead more
productive lives; and they can become numerous enough to
constitute a great natural resource in any society. In addition,
they may be utilizing their nervous systems to their fullest
potentials goal most of us are far from reaching.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">To these three aims, I would add a fourth, not
derived from the Indian pattern:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><i>4. Encouragement of individuals to satisfy
their needs for altered consciousness by means that do not
require external tools. </i>Any tools used to alter
consciousness-not just drugs-tend to cause dependence, because
they delude people into believing that the experience comes from
them rather than involuntarily from within the mind. To guard
against this tendency, therefore, we must educate people and not
try to do away with the tools. Our goal should be to train people
to live safely in a world where there are things with potential
for both harm and good, to show them that inimical forces can be
changed into friendly ones. To do this, we should not try to
shield young people from things that may harm them; they must
learn by experience. Perhaps it is possible to convince
adolescents that meditation is better than drugs as an approach
to altered consciousness, but they will not believe it unless
they have been through drug experience and seen its limitations
for themselves.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I will conclude by affirming my belief that
this system is a real possibility and not a hopeless,
unattainable ideal. As such, it is well worth working toward. The
first step need be nothing more than to stop what we are now
doing to prevent us from reaching the goal. And that is nearly
everything we are doing in the name of combating drug abuse.<br>

<h1>Dealing with Drug Abuse</h1>

<p><b>A Report to the Ford Foundation</b> </p>

<h2>Foreword</h2>

<p><b>by McGeorge Bundy</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This report grew out of an effort by the Ford Foundation to
understand the massive and complex problem of drug abuse in the
United States and to determine the most effective ways in which
the Foundation might contribute to efforts to deal with the
problem. </p>

<p>Like many institutions working in such fields as education and
poverty, we encountered the growing blight of drug abuse
increasingly in the 1960's. The Foundation made a number of
grants to projects that dealt with drug abuse as an aspect of a
larger problem, as in work with high school students, faculty,
and parents to understand and overcome the alienation of youth.
As drug abuse increased, however, the Foundation considered
whether it might undertake a larger program. The study that led
to this report, undertaken in mid-1970, was the first step in
that consideration. </p>

<p>The second important step was to join with three other
foundations that have shared our concern with drug abuse-the
Carnegie Corporation, the Commonwealth Fund, and the Henry J.
Kaiser Family Foundation-in financing one of the principal
recommendations of the report, namely, the establishment of an
independent national Drug Abuse Council. The four foundations
have now committed substantial funds for the first several years
of the Council's work. </p>

<p>The functions of the Drug Abuse Council will include: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Analysis of the development and results of public
        policies in the drug-abuse field </li>
    <li>Dissemination to the public of accurate data on the
        causes, extent, and treatment of drug abuse </li>
    <li>Promotion of needed research </li>
    <li>Synthesis and distribution of available information in
        research and treatment </li>
    <li>Evaluation of treatment and education programs </li>
</ul>

<p>Details of the Council's composition and plans are expected to
be announced shortly after this manuscript goes to press. </p>

<p>The report leading to the establishment of the Council-the
work of an outstanding independent task force of lawyers,
scientists, and other investigators-identified four major problem
areas in the drug-abuse field: heroin addiction in urban
ghettoes; drug experimentation by the young; overuse of legal
stimulants and tranquilizers; and the use of drugs to control
deviant behavior, especially among children. </p>

<p>The task-force report was intended principally for the Ford
Foundation's guidance. Yet, the scope and quality of the work
were such that the Foundation shared the first draft, in
December, 1970, with legal, scientific, and governmental
authorities active in efforts to control and prevent drug abuse.
The reaction to the report was strongly affirmative. The report
was praised for its thorough, clear, and sober analysis, and a
number of authorities urged the Foundation to make it available
to a wider audience. Accordingly, the Foundation asked the staff
of the developing Drug Abuse Council. to bring up to date those
sections dealing with aspects of the problem in which there had
been substantial change since the first draft was prepared. We
believe that this revised, expanded, and updated report is both a
forerunner and the first product of the Drug Abuse Council. As
such, we believe it is a promising harbinger of other
contributions the Council may make, both in understanding this
spreading danger to American society and in helping to curb it. </p>

<p>We hope that the report will be useful to the public at large
as well as to specialists, for the drug-abuse problem is so broad
and complex that effective efforts to overcome it will demand the
understanding and support of as many Americans as possible. <br>

<h1>Dealing with Drug Abuse</h1>

<p><b>A Report to the Ford Foundation</b> </p>

<h2>Preface</h2>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In April, 1970, the Ford Foundation asked us to undertake a
broad survey of the drug-abuse problem in this country and to
report back by the end of the year on what activities private
foundations might usefully undertake in this field. During May to
December, 1970, we had the opportunity to review the drug-abuse
field, both through a study of the literature and through
extensive interviews. The report was completed by December 1,
1970, and submitted to several foundations for their
consideration. </p>

<p>We did not anticipate making any startling new discoveries in
this field, and, in fact, we have made none. We cannot say that
there is a magic solution to the problem of drug abuse. Rapid or
remarkable results in this area cannot be promised. Alleviation
of local and national drug-abuse problems will come, in our
judgment, through a slow and painful process of social change and
accommodation. Insofar as our report can help to establish the
mechanisms by which such change and accommodation may begin, and
even be accelerated, it will have more than served its intended
purpose. </p>

<p>The report is reproduced here without change. Although we have
added occasional footnotes to indicate significant developments
since December, 1970, we have concluded that any attempt to take
note of every factual change would be both futile and
unnecessary. Suffice it to say that developments during the past
year have only underscored the thrust of the original report. </p>

<p>Appendixes to the main report were developed largely by the
project staff both during 1970 and after the report itself was
completed and submitted to the foundations, in order to record
some of the more detailed information gathered in the course of
the survey. These staff papers may be considered current as of
about September, 1971. Although they do not always represent a
consensus of the project participants, they do make a useful
contribution to knowledge and discussion in the field. </p>

<p>It is not possible to name all of those to whom we are
indebted for assistance with the survey and the report. We spoke
to hundreds of people throughout the country, all of whom
generously provided time and material. The trustees, officers,
and staff of the Ford Foundation provided complete freedom for
this inquiry, together with ample financial support. We are
especially indebted to Mitchell Sviridoff and Thomas Wright for
their personal involvement. The Carnegie Corporation, the
Commonwealth Fund, and the Kaiser Foundation have been most
encouraging in their consideration of the report, as have
numerous other foundations and organizations. </p>

<p>We could not have undertaken the work involved in this survey
or completed the report without the strong support of James V.
DeLong, the only professional staff member who worked on the
project from beginning to end. His tenacity in ferreting out the
types of elusive facts on which any useful report must inevitably
rely, and his detailed and repeated review of the work product
have won him the respect of the entire drug-abuse field. We would
also like to give special thanks to Peter Wilson, who was with
the project during the first hectic period. </p>

<p>Substantial support in the form of time and resources was
freely donated by the Washington law firm of Covington &amp;
Burling. We also wish to thank the support staff-Meg Gleason,
Jacqueline Volpe, Angela Corley, Joan Henderson, Janine Yunker,
and Lilly Smith-for their skill and patience in finding and
keeping track of material and in preparing and revising endless
drafts. </p>

<p>Finally, we are gratified by the announcement that the Drug
Abuse Council proposed in the report has been established and is
beginning operations. We wish its new President, Thomas E.
Bryant, M.D., and the Chairman of its Board, Bethuel M. Webster,
success in bringing this new venture to fruition.<br>

<h1>Dealing with Drug Abuse </h1>

<p><b>A Report to the Ford Foundation</b> </p>

<p>THE DRUG ABUSE SURVEY PROJECT </p>

<h2>Summary of Findings, Conclusions, and Recommendations </h2>

<p>by Patricia M. Wald and Peter Barton Hutt </p>

<hr>

<p><b>The Present Problem and Efforts to Control It </b></p>

<p><b>A More Promising Approach to Drug Abuse </b></p>

<p><b>The Drug Abuse Council</b> </p>

<p>This report, which summarizes the results of the Drug Abuse
Survey Project, is based upon extensive reading and numerous
interviews with workers in the field throughout the country. </p>

<p>Part I describes the present drug-abuse problem in this
country and what is currently being done to control it. Part 11
summarizes the project's views on a more promising approach to
drug-abuse problems. Part III sets forth the project's
recommendations for private foundation activity in this field. </p>

<p>Two preliminary observations are essential to this discussion.
First, in many aspects of this field, important basic facts have
not yet been determined and perhaps cannot be determined in the
near future; conclusions, therefore, depend on fragmentary
information and primarily on judgment. Because of the emotional
and moral attitudes involved in drug issues, conclusions differ
widely among individuals and are strongly and deeply held.
Secondly, even where facts exist, experts in the field often
disagree on their meaning and significance. We have found few
areas in which there is not widespread disagreement. </p>

<p>As a result, in arriving at the project's conclusions and
recommendations, we have relied strongly on the judgment of the
Cochairmen and the Executive Director. It should be understood
that at least one recognized expert could readily be found to
challenge, perhaps vehemently, virtually any statement we make or
might make. It appears that there can be no such thing as
consensus or a noncontroversial report on drug abuse. </p>

<hr>

<p><font size="5"><b>THE PRESENT PROBLEM AND EFFORTS TO CONTROL
IT</b></font> </p>

<p><b>THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF DRUG ABUSE</b> </p>

<p>Staff Report I describes the characteristics of the most
common drugs of abuse. For purposes of this report, such socially
accepted and legal drugs as alcohol and nicotine have been
excluded, and &quot;drug abuse&quot; has been limited primarily
to heroin, marijuana, stimulant and depressant drugs, and
hallucinogens. </p>

<p>The effects of a drug, the pattern of drug use, the prognosis
for the user, and the bases of social concern all vary widely
depending on the drug used, the age and class of the user, and
the circumstances. No categorization, therefore, is totally
satisfactory. The four core problems, however, have been broadly
delineated by many commentators as: (1) the use of heroin in
urban poverty areas, (2) experimentation with a wide variety of
drugs by the young, (3) the use of drugs by middle-aged and older
persons as a form of quasi-self-medication, and (4) the use of
drugs as a behavior-control device. </p>

<p>Heroin in Urban Poverty Areas. According to our best
estimates, there were, as of November, 1970, approximately
150,000 to 250,000 active heroin addicts in the United States.'
(Some estimates run as high as 300,000 heroin addicts in New York
City and 600,000 nationally, but these figures have little
support.) The addicts are heavily concentrated in the poorest
areas of large metropolitan areas. Probably half live in New
York, and 60 to 70 per cent of them are black, Puerto Rican, or
Mexican-American. Almost 85 per cent are male. </p>

<p>These figures represent people who use heroin on a daily
basis, injecting a dose every six to eight hours as the effect of
the previous dose wears off. They may spend anywhere from $10 to
$100 per day on heroin, depending on their dosage and tolerance,
their economic ability to sustain the habit, the purity of the
drug bought, and the price level of the city in which they live. </p>

<p>There is an additional, though unknown, population that uses
heroin only occasionally, either alone or as part of a pattern of
multiple drug use. The size of this group is a matter of
conjecture and debate. Some experts believe that repetitive use
of heroin leads inexorably to addiction, whereas others believe
that there is a substantial number of intermittent users who do
not become addicted. </p>

<p>It is not possible to resolve this issue definitively. It
seems probable, however, that a large number of persons have
experimented with heroin a few times without becoming addicted.
Heroin is easily available in the slum areas of most major
cities. Although a large habit is expensive, a single dose is
cheap ($1 or less for a capsule containing about I mg. of heroin
in Washington, D.C.), and the unit of sale in many places is so
small that a neophyte can take it without much fear of an
overdose. It seems likely that a large percentage of the young
black males in any large urban lower-class area have tried
heroin. The majority who have experimented with it have not
become addicted. And, although the potency of heroin makes it
difficult to believe that large numbers of intermittent users
never become addicted, this possibility cannot be ruled out on
the basis of present information. </p>

<p>Although heroin is a primary drug for the addict, multiple
drug use is exceedingly common. According to some studies,
between 40 and 60 per cent of the addicts use one of the
amphetamines or barbiturates as a secondary drug on a regular
basis. Cocaine, a strong nonaddictive stimulant, is also used
widely. </p>

<p>The tremendous wave of concern about heroin that has swept the
country appears to be caused primarily by the fear of crime
associated with addiction. Heroin itself does not cause criminal
behavior in any physiological or psychological sense, but the
need to maintain an expensive habit often does. A heroin addict
will do almost anything to obtain money to buy the drug. There is
virtually no way in which a poor, black, unskilled youth can earn
legally the $30 per day that is required for the average habit.
To maintain his addiction, he can deal in drugs, engage in
consensual crime, or steal. It is reasonable to estimate that
addicts steal between $1 billion and $2 billion in merchandise
per year. Estimates of thefts in New York City alone range from a
low of $.25 billion to a high of $1.9 billion. There is some
evidence that up to 50 per cent of property crimes in the major
metropolitan areas with a serious heroin addiction problem are
committed by addicts. On the other hand, there is evidence that
most addicts engaged in crime before they became addicted.
Addiction, therefore, cannot necessarily be regarded as the cause
of a criminal life-style, although it unquestionably intensifies
criminal activity. </p>

<p>A secondary cause of the current concern about heroin is the
fear that it has, or will, spread throughout society. While
heroin is undoubtedly now available in the suburbs, there is
little evidence that it represents a substantial problem there.
It remains largely a lower-class drug. </p>

<p>A third cause commonly cited for the concern about heroin is
fear of the effects of the drug on the user. Actually, there is
no proof that heroin itself causes any organic damage to the body
or brain similar, for example, to the extensive damage caused by
alcohol. Death through overdose has been attributed by medical
experts to the fact that heroin is a powerful nervous-system
suppressant that may cause respiration to cease when the dosage
exceeds the individual's tolerance, or to the fact that some
individuals may experience a severe allergic reaction to heroin. </p>

<p>It seems possible that many addicts would function normally if
given a steady supply of good-quality drugs. The real harm to
users is that they presently tend to become social dropouts, in
that the illegal status of the drug causes them to spend all
their time obtaining and using it. There seems little doubt that,
if it were not for the fear of crime and the spread of heroin to
the suburbs, most of society would not be seriously worried about
heroin addiction. </p>

<p>Youthful Drug Experimentation. Within the last five years
there has been a substantial increase in the use of illicit
nonopiate drugs by the young, particularly among middle-class
college and high school students and young military personnel.
The prevalent drugs of abuse for this group are marijuana (and,
to some extent, the more potent cannabis product, hashish), oral
amphetamines and barbiturates, LSD, and other hallucinogens.
During 1971 the use of heroin by GI's in Vietnam became, for the
first time, a matter of grave public concern. </p>

<p>As of November, 1971, the best estimates are that 15 million
people in this country have experimented with marijuana. Possibly
30 per cent of these go on to become occasional users, and 5 per
cent become frequent users. While these estimates are very
uncertain, survey research supports the conclusion that marijuana
use has spread fantastically in the last few years. One survey of
200 colleges found that 47 per cent of those interviewed had
smoked it 34 per cent occasionally and 13 per cent frequently.
There are major differences among colleges, of course. Other
surveys found that 70 per cent of the student body at one medical
school were current users of marijuana, as compared with 44 per
cent and 5 per cent at two other medical schools. Extrapolating
from available statistics, it is likely that 20 per cent of all
Americans between the ages of. 15 and 35 have used marijuana at
least once -a crime for which they could have been imprisoned by
the federal government for up to ten years.' </p>

<p>There is currently little evidence that marijuana causes
physical harm. The federal government is now engaged in a crash
research program to find out the short- and long-term effects of
marijuana. Critics of this research program argue that it is
intended simply to justify current federal policy and is not a
sound independent scientific investigation. Even persons who are
sympathetic to marijuana use will be surprised, however, if it is
discovered that marijuana use in large amounts over a long period
of time is totally harmless. The real issue over marijuana
appears to be not whether it causes mild physical damage but
whether its use has already spread so widely that, as is true of
alcohol, the social costs of efforts to prohibit it exceed the
physical costs that would be incurred by eliminating criminal
penalties for, or even legalizing, its use.' </p>

<p>Experimentation with oral amphetamines and barbiturate drugs,
all of which have recognized medical uses and are therefore often
easily obtainable, is probably second only to the use of
marijuana. Some 18 per cent of the students in the 200-campus
survey had tried amphetamines, and 15 per cent had tried
barbiturates, but only 2 per cent and 1 per cent, respectively,
had used them frequently. There are no more reliable estimates
available. </p>

<p>A quite dangerous pattern of middle-class youthful amphetamine
drug use is the injectable methamphetamine (&quot;speed&quot;)
Culture. Intravenous injections of methamphetamine usually take
the form of continuous use of massive doses for several days.
Users may become psychotic while under its influence, and it is
probably the drug most likely to lead directly to violence. There
is some evidence that it causes serious organic damage. Speed
also tends to make the user lose interest in food, sleep, and
hygiene. Because of these extreme effects, a speed
&quot;run&quot; is hard to sustain over any length of time, and
the end of a period of heavy speed use-the
&quot;crash&quot;-produces serious depression. Users have learned
over time that they can make the crash smoother by taking
barbiturates or heroin. Reports from San Francisco, the first
city to have a sizable speed culture, are that heroin is becoming
the drug of choice for a large proportion of former speed users
because it is a more pleasant &quot;down&quot; than the
barbiturates. </p>

<p>The use of LSD originally peaked in about 1967, declined
briefly, and then started to increase again as the early reports
about genetic damage caused by the drug were discredited and as
use spread downward into the high schools. The survey that found
marijuana use among 47 per cent of college students on 200
campuses found that 11 per cent had used LSD, but only I per cent
used it frequently. The National Institute of Mental Health had
earlier reported surveys showing a 2 to 9 per cent range of LSD
use among college students, with an over-all average of 5 per
cent. While a ratio of one LSD experimenter to every five triers
of marijuana seems too high for the population at large, or even
for most colleges and high schools, it does illustrate a higher
rate of current usage than has been suspected. </p>

<p>There is general agreement that LSD is a powerful drug that
should be used with care. In clinical use, severe reactions are
rare. One study found that 25,000 administrations of LSD or
mescaline to 5,000 people resulted in serious complications in
only 0.08 per cent of experimental subjects and 0.34 per cent of
subjects who were undergoing therapy. There is no scientific
certainty concerning other types of reaction that have been
alleged, but not proved, to result from LSD use, such as
flashbacks and birth defects. The long-term effects are not
known. </p>

<p>Youthful . experimentation may also involve heroin, especially
in the ghetto. A recent survey of juvenile addicts in Washington,
D.C., showed that over half started directly by mainlining heroin
rather than first using other drugs. Among middle-class youth,
however, experimentation with marijuana predominates, and heroin
is probably the least used drug. </p>

<p>Youthful middle-class experimentation with heroin as part of a
pattern of multidrug use does appear to be increasing. This
phenomenon is too new, and information is too fragmentary, to
judge whether it represents the beginnings of significant growth
in middle-class addiction. Preliminary reports indicate that
people who become involved with heroin in this non-ghetto context
have less tendency toward heavy involvement. </p>

<p>The extent of penetration of drugs other than marijuana is
difficult to assess. Considerably fewer young people seem to have
tried oral doses of amphetamines and barbiturates than have tried
marijuana, but more appear to have tried them than have tried
LSD. The number of young people who become heavily involved with
amphetamines (especially injectable methamphetamine) and
barbiturates is unknown but is probably of about the same
magnitude as those heavily involved with LSD. </p>

<p>Society's current concern about youthful drug experimentation
is often attributed to the possible detrimental effect on the
health of drug users. Certainly, concern about the potential harm
from heroin experimentation in the ghetto is far more justified
than concern about marijuana experimentation in the suburbs. It
is our judgment, however, that physical harm is actually only a
partial cause of this public concern. There are, after all, up to
9 million alcoholics, whose alcohol abuse affects a total of well
over 30 million people in this country, a far larger number than
are affected by drug abuse; yet, this enormous health problem has
created relatively little public concern. </p>

<p>Rather, the principal force behind the present public concern
about youthful middle-class experimentation seems to relate to
differences in perceptions and life-styles between older and
younger generations. Older persons tend to accept the use of
drugs only for therapeutic purposes. They do not regard alcohol
and nicotine as &quot;drugs&quot; and believe that the substances
can be properly used for social and personal pleasure. But the
older generation regards the use of drugs, such as marijuana and
LSD, for social and personal pleasure as symptomatic of
disrespect for law and authority and as an attempt to escape
responsibility. In contrast, many in the younger generation tend
to regard the use of drugs for social and personal pleasure as
entirely proper. Use of such drugs as marijuana and LSD is
therefore viewed by them as an opportunity for enhancement of
personal experience, an act of social custom within a peer group,
or a mark of youthful rebellion and independence similar to
smoking weeds or sipping beer behind the barn fifty years ago. </p>

<p>Drug Use among the Middle-aged and Elderly. Millions of people
use psychoactive drugs as a way of coping with the tensions and
problems of everyday living. Current estimates are vague, but in
a 1967 survey 25 per cent of all persons over 18 reported use of
a psychoactive drug during the preceding year. The number of
persons reporting use of a tranquilizer at some time in their
lives rose from 7 per cent in 1957 to 27 per cent in 1967.
American industry apparently produces about 4 billion dosage
units of barbiturates (not including other major and minor
tranquilizers) and 8 billion dosage units of amphetamines each
year. It is charged that half of these are diverted to the
illegal market at some point, and an unknown proportion of the
rest are prescribed carelessly. Some of these drugs are used by
heroin addicts and youthful experimenters. Most are not so used,
however, and the problem of self-prescribed use of these drugs is
one that pervades all strata of society. (In addition, about 10
per cent of the 80 million people who use alcohol have a serious
problem of dependence.) </p>

<p>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is now
conducting a series of comprehensive drug-use surveys, which
should provide an accurate picture of the extent of middle-age
and elderly drug abuse with legal as well as illegal drugs. The
project includes research into the frequency and situational
aspects of this problem. </p>

<p>Why certain persons become dependent on these drugs is not
clear. As in the case of heroin addiction, there is considerable
debate as to what physiological and psychological factors are
involved. </p>

<p>The personal costs of this type of drug abuse can be very
high. Of all the potential drugs of abuse, alcohol is one of the
most damaging, since even relatively light consumption clearly
causes some damage to such organs as the brain and liver, and
heavy consumption causes serious damage and sometimes death.
Barbiturates cause damage very similar to that caused by alcohol,
and, in the formal literature, these two drugs are regarded as
essentially additive and interchangeable in chronic intoxication.
With barbiturates, as well as alcohol, there is a serious risk of
lethal overdose. The personal costs of steady amphetamine use are
not clear. Experts believe that large doses entail a high risk of
organic damage. There appears to be no clear evidence concerning
smaller doses. </p>

<p>The social costs of alcoholism are now fairly well known and
need not be detailed here, but the social costs of the abuse of
barbiturates and amphetamines are still largely unknown. The
social benefits attributable to these drugs are equally
uncertain. There is clearly a widely felt need for the particular
effects of the various drugs. It is far from clear that
elimination of this form of drug abuse would result in net
benefits to the society, because one cannot be sure that other
possible responses to life situations would be less harmful. It
is possible that reducing the use of tranquilizers would result
in a rise of the violent crime rate, or in the divorce rate, or
in child beating. It almost certainly would require greater
institutionalization of persons with borderline emotional
problems. </p>

<p>Drugs in Behavior Control. A fourth emerging problem is the
overprescription of drugs to control the behavior of captive
populations, such as overactive school children and nursing-home
residents, where other, nondrug methods of control should
properly be used instead. Recent information has revealed
significant use of amphetamines to calm down behavior in the
classrooms of urban public schools. At the other end of the age
spectrum, tranquilizers are reportedly being used far too
extensively on elderly patients in nursing homes to keep them
from clamoring for the attention of overworked attendants. </p>

<p>These drugs are properly used, within limits of sound medical
practice approved by the Food and Drug Administration, for
hyper-kinetic children and elderly patients with emotional
problems. There is a serious danger, however, that they may be
used as a simple method of managing school children,
institutionalized patients, and correctional inmates as a
substitute for a competent staff and the other resources needed
in dealing with those not able to care for themselves. And, as
the range of behavior-controlling drugs becomes wider, we can
anticipate even greater problems in their use in unwarranted
situations. </p>

<p><b>BASIC RESEARCH ON DRUG ABUSE</b> </p>

<p>Existing Research. Most of the basic research now being done
on drugs of abuse is conducted by the NIMH Addiction Research
Center (ARC) at Lexington, Kentucky, or conducted or financed by
grant or contract through the NIMH Division of Narcotic Addiction
and Drug Abuse and the NIMH Division of Psycbopharmacology. </p>

<p>ARC is an interdisciplinary group doing basic research on the
physiological effects of a number of drugs of abuse, and one of
the very few to our knowledge that has recently conducted any
research with heroin. Its 1970 budget is about $.8 million. Its
principal functions are research on the abuse potential of drugs
and on opiate antagonists. ARC would need far more personnel,
ranging from senior research scientists to technicians and
paraprofessionals, and far more funds if it were to expand its
activities broadly to include basic research on the cause and
nature of all drug abuse and drug dependence. </p>

<p>NIMH funds for intramural and extramural research relating to
drug abuse have increased threefold in five years.' The figures
below include research in pharmacology, sociology, psychology, <br>
</p>

<p>Year Budget Authority </p>

<p>(1,000,000) </p>

<p>1966 6.4 </p>

<p>1967 10.6 </p>

<p>1968 13.3 </p>

<p>1969 14.1 </p>

<p>1970 16.3 </p>

<p>1971 18.3 </p>

<p>TOTAL: $79.0<br>
</p>

<p>and many other areas. They also apparently include at least
some of the research on psychoactive drugs sponsored by the NIMH
Division of Psychopharmacology, which is interested primarily in
the use of drugs in the treatment of mental disorders. </p>

<p>The research funds are dispersed among the various drugs of
abuse, not concentrated on one or two. For 1970, the only year
for which we now have information, the division by drugs was as
follows: </p>

<p>Drugs Allocation </p>

<p>000,000) </p>

<p>Opiates 3.8 </p>

<p>Marijuana 2.3 </p>

<p>Hallucinogens 1.8 </p>

<p>Barbiturates 5.3 </p>

<p>Amphetamines 2.8 </p>

<p>Other .3 </p>

<p>TOTAL: $16.3 </p>

<p>NIMH is unable to provide either a dollar breakdown on the
types of research represented (pharmacology, sociology, etc.) or
a breakdown by drug for previous years. In 1970, $1.3 million of
the money spent on marijuana research was dispersed through
special contracts. ARC received $.8 million of the money
designated for opiate research to operate its program. An
undeterminable amount is spent by the Division of
Psychopharmacology and other parts of NIMH.' The balance of
research expenditures represents about 50 grants to specific
individuals and institutions given on application. </p>

<p>The allocation of grant resources is determined primarily by
an advisory committee of physical and social scientists that
reviews all applications for funding and assigns them a priority
ranking on the basis of scientific merit. While NIMH
administrators have some authority to overrule the committee
(they can fund a low priority project instead of a high-priority
one, but they cannot fund a project if the committee refuses to
assign it any priority at all), we have been informed that this
happens rarely. </p>

<p>We have also been informed that little or no effort is made to
create a program of research. Applications are reviewed in a
vacuum. Consideration is not given to the importance or relevance
of the research to policy issues or to major scientific and
medical questions, or to alternative uses of the research budget.
The results of prior projects are reportedly not made available
to the committee for its consideration in reviewing current grant
applications. No significant effort is made to encourage grant
applications in areas of particular interest to scientists,
physicians, and the government. </p>

<p>The Justice Department's Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous
Drugs (BNDD) has engaged in some research in the past and still
has some ongoing efforts on the abuse potential of drugs, the
sociology of drug use, the characteristics of dealers, and the
market structure of the drug traffic. The decision has recently
been made, however, that BNDD's research role is to be limited to
subjects related to law enforcement. </p>

<p>A major problem with basic research conducted or funded by the
federal government is that it is necessarily limited by
governmental policy. Thus, as might be expected, there are large
gaps in our basic knowledge about drugs of abuse. In particular,
basic experimentation with the effects of heroin on chronic
heroin addicts has been virtually ignored in view of the strong
federal policy against any such research. Until very recently,
federal policy also virtually precluded marijuana research in
humans. Federal regulations single out LSD and a handful of other
hallucinogens, from among all known drugs, as requiring specific
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of an Investigational
New Drug Plan (rather than just filing the plan, as is true for
all other drugs) before clinical investigation may begin. Under
the 1970 federal drug-abuse law, research with heroin, marijuana,
and LSD may be conducted only after the Secretary of HEW has
approved the researcher and the protocol. In short, current
governmental policy is a critical factor in determining the type
of research that may be done under federal auspices or approval. </p>

<p>Other possible sources of funding for basic research on drugs
of abuse are the states, the universities, and the pharmaceutical
industry. Thus far, the states have concentrated on applied
research, primarily in the area of treatment. The universities
appear to have no significant source of funds for basic research
other than the federal government. And the pharmaceutical
industry concentrates primarily on product-oriented applied
research. As a practical matter, therefore, most basic research
depends on federal funds. </p>

<p>The pharmaceutical industry's research efforts are not only
product-oriented but, indeed, have the goals of increasing the
number of psychoactive drugs, enhancing their effect, or
improving their activity in some other fashion. From the
standpoint of drug abuse, the pharmaceutical industry is working
night and day to create products that will intensify the problem.
Many of these drugs, of course, have enormous medical value that
far outweighs their abuse potential. </p>

<p>The Need for Additional Basic Research. It is apparent that
there is a serious lack of basic information about how drugs of
abuse work and their long-term effects on the body. Many examples
could be given, but a few will make the point: </p>

<p>Since World War 11, there have been over 3,000 technical
papers on LSD. But scientists still do not know why LSD causes a
psychoactive effect, or whether it is toxic, or whether it causes
birth defects, or whether the widely reported
&quot;flashback&quot; effect is real or imagined and, if real,
has an organic basis. In short, many of the most important
questions remain unanswered. </p>

<p>Morphine was first isolated in the early 1800's, and heroin
was synthesized in the late 1800's. Among the things we still do
not know about these drugs are the mechanisms by which tolerance
develops, or whether an addict can be stabilized on a given dose,
or whether the drugs cause any organic damage, or the mechanism
by which they alleviate pain, or even whether withdrawal can be
psychologically as well as physically induced. </p>

<p>While it is common knowledge that many drug users, including
those on methadone, use combinations of drugs, little is known
about the effects of these combinations. For example, mixtures of
heroin and cocaine, or of amphetamines and barbiturates, are
often taken, but we do not know how they interact. </p>

<p>We have been unable to discern agreement among researchers on
what is and is not known, or on the priority needs for research,
with respect to the drugs of abuse. </p>

<p>Basic research questions concerning psychoactive drugs can be
divided roughly into two groups: (1) toxicological and
pharmacological effects, and (2) psychological and perceptual
effects. </p>

<p>Scientists probably know most about the toxicology (organic
damage done to the human body) of drugs of abuse, yet even here
there are many unanswered questions. It is known, for example,
that excessive use of alcohol and barbiturates causes extreme
damage to the brain and liver. It is suspected that amphetamines
in massive doses also cause organic damage, but scientists are
not yet sure. There is insufficient toxicological information on
the opiates (e.g., heroin, morphine), the cannabinols (e.g.,
marijuana, hashish), and the hallucinogens (e.g., LSD,
mescaline), the three categories of drugs with which the country
is most concerned. </p>

<p>The organic damage caused by drugs is, of course, only one
aspect of the more general study of pharmacological effects that
is, on what cells does a drug operate, how does it operate, what
metabolites are triggered, and so forth. Nor are such questions
unique to drugs of abuse. There appears to be no general theory
of drug action based on the chemical structure of drugs into
which discrete studies of the pharmacology of the drugs of abuse
can be fitted. And there is a question whether psychoactive drugs
do or do not represent a separate class of pharmacological
compounds that can be studied at a theoretical level, independent
of the study of pharmacology generally. </p>

<p>Basic pharmacological research would undoubtedly provide
useful knowledge for basic researchers, from which they may some
day construct a general theory of psychoactive drug action. The
central-nervous-system effect of drugs is, however, a
particularly difficult area of study. Many of the drugs with
which we are concerned have effects that are apparently quite
subtle and difficult to delineate. Some of the major
tranquilizers, which exert immensely potent effects on the brain,
have been studied intensively by NIMH for almost twenty years,
and we still do not really know how they work. It is uncertain
whether more could be learned faster by studying LSD, marijuana,
or even heroin. In short, the road to a general understanding of
the pharmacological effects of psychoactive drugs is difficult,
and basic research in this area is not guaranteed to be
productive. </p>

<p>Brain functioning is, of course, one of the current frontiers
of science, and the complexities of studying the central nervous
system make it likely that this area will remain a frontier for
years, if not decades. Although drugs are simply one type of
instrument for the study of the broader questions, the drugs of
abuse may be a particularly interesting input because they
clearly have large effects on the brain. </p>

<p>There is a great deal of work to be done here, and much of it
will be important. As the pharmacologists study the physiological
correlates of drugs and the psychopharmacologists and
experimental psychologists study the psychic correlates, at some
point in time linkages will be made leading to a unified view of
the entire process. </p>

<p>The second category of potential research concerns the general
interaction between drug taking and psychological and perceptual
awareness. Such psychological variables as anxiety levels,
attitudes toward self, perceptions, attention span, and mental
ability are all affected by drug taking. Conversely, pre-existing
states of mind and attitude have a significant impact on whether
an individual will seek drugs in the first place and on the
actual effects of a drug once it is taken. </p>

<p>Historically, because drug abuse has been looked at primarily
from the standpoint of deviant behavior, the study of its
psychological and perceptual effects has been placed largely
under the heading of psychopathology. Interest in the role of
external stimuli, of which drugs are but one example, in altering
the individual's perception and awareness of his surroundings has
increased in recent years. There is, for example, greater
scientific interest in the subjective experiences and
descriptions, rather than simply objective phenomena, connected
with drug taking. As with basic pharmacology, there is much
important information yet to be obtained in this developing area,
all of which is fundamental to a better understanding of human
functioning; but the progress of such research will likely be
slow and uncertain. </p>

<p>This area of interest, also, is not discrete. There are
clearly physical correlates for different states of perception
and awareness, although the links have yet to be forged. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>DRUG EDUCATION AND PREVENTION</b> </p>

<p>There is substantial uncertainty and confusion in the area of
drug education and prevention. Although nearly all workers in the
field believe strongly that sensitive and accurate drug education
programs can play an important role in preventing harmful drug
experiences among youth, there is no real evidence that such
educational efforts are successful. Educators are cautious about
new programs because of concern in some quarters that too much
discussion about drugs of abuse could glamorize them and lead to
experimentation. There is also increasing concern about the use
of ex-addicts in schools. Although they are popular with students
for &quot;telling it like it is,&quot; there is justifiable fear
that providing them with an aura of prestige may lead significant
numbers of students to believe that they can and should try drugs
themselves. </p>

<p>Past efforts have generally been of the &quot;scare&quot;
type, emphasizing the moral and physical degradation of drug
abuse and generously sprinkled with blatant misinformation,
especially about marijuana. In schools, such lectures are usually
delivered by gym teachers or visiting law-enforcement officials.
Their aim has been one-dimensional-to stop young people from
trying any illegal drugs. </p>

<p>It is now widely recognized that drug education, to succeed
with increasingly sophisticated young audiences, must be
accurate, factual, and consistent with the listener's own
experiences or observations. Although a truly candid educational
program may reduce involvement with the more dangerous drugs,
such as heroin, it may also increase experimentation with the
less dangerous drugs, such as marijuana, and many educators are
reluctant to be drawn into an approach with such potentially
controversial consequences. The federal government spent $3.5
million during the summer of 1970 in an attempt to train 350
schoolteachers, administrators, and student leaders to conduct
workshops in their home communities dispensing information about
drugs. The ability to withstand attitudinal confrontations of
skeptical students was stressed. We have no indication whether
this program was successful. </p>

<p>Virtually none of the myriad drug-education programs swamping
the market from private companies, civic organizations, and even
the government itself has been evaluated. The only detailed
evaluation we have seen, involving a model-education program in a
high school, showed that students improved not only in their
factual knowledge but in their cautionary attitude toward drug
use. That evaluation showed that the students liked the personal
accounts of ex-addicts best but chose doctors to tell the facts.
The students wanted more emphasis on the particular drugs in
common use in their school and an approach that took the drugs up
one by one rather than all grouped together. </p>

<p>The current emphasis among educators is on a continuous
spectrum of education about drugs generally (legal and illegal),
from kindergarten through high school, and on the integration of
drug education into other social-problems curricula, which would
include alcohol, smoking, sex, family living, and so forth. Dr.
Norman Zinberg of Harvard has been evaluating such an
experimental course for senior and junior high schools outside of
Boston and expects to produce an effective and exportable
curriculum. Dr. William Soskin in California has a different kind
of program, for which school credit is given, that creates a
third force besides family and school in the youth's life-a
primary group with which he shares experiences all week,
including a heavy emphasis on inner exploration. </p>

<p>One intrinsic problem with any kind of school-based education
is that a large portion of serious student drug users have
already rejected school. The motivational exploration that
educators stress can be carried on only in a spirit of trust, and
too many schools still require teachers and counselors to report
all known or suspected users to the police. Only a few schools
have had the courage to experiment with the designation of one or
more teachers or counselors as official confidants to whom
students can turn for help without fear of exposure. Few schools
have close working alliances with treatment resources to which
they can refer students. Parental permission for such treatment
poses another legal obstacle to such desirable arrangements. It
is doubtful that the federal government's crash summer
teacher-training program can surmount these basic problems
without a more fundamental change in community attitudes. </p>

<p>The National Coordinating Council on Drug Abuse Education and
Information, composed of nearly one hundred government and
private agency members, has recently entered the drug education
field.' It conducts evaluations of the explosion of anti drug
films and literature and stresses rational, coordinated efforts
by city leaders to explore the basis and true extent of a
community's drug problems and how the community can best utilize
its resources for dealing with them. NCC's approach is that drug
education should not aim at suppression of all illicit drug use
but should teach children to make rational decisions based on
reliable information about which drugs they will use and how much
they will use them. </p>

<p>It can reasonably be expected that more federal money will be
channeled to the states and cities for drug education, with
little direction on how it should be spent. There are only the
most primitive notions of how to determine whether a
drug-education program has been successful. Even the goals of
such programs are hotly contested. And there is little emphasis
on evaluation techniques by the federal government. </p>

<p>At least in the immediate future, most schools will probably
be unable to alter their basic authoritarian structure to the
kind of open-minded approach to drug education that will help
early experimenters or drug-prone students. The mere presentation
of basic facts,, even if honestly set forth, can be expected to
have limited value in stopping the spread of youthful
experimentation, and a law-enforcement orientation that requires
school personnel to report all users will totally undermine
education efforts. </p>

<p>It is probably also true that adults, more than school
children, need accurate drug information to counter long-held
myths. An appalling number of well-educated parents, as well as
their children, still fail to understand the real differences
among drugs of abuse. This misunderstanding is perpetuated in the
1970 federal drug-abuse law, which provides a one-year maximum
prison sentence for possession of any illegal drug, regardless of
whether it is quite dangerous (like heroin) or less harmful (like
marijuana). </p>

<hr>

<p><b>TREATMENT</b> </p>

<p>With respect to treatment, two basic problems exist. First,
relatively few drug-dependent persons are currently in treatment
programs, largely because the programs do not have sufficient
facilities or staff. Second, existing treatment for drug abuse
and drug dependence has not produced impressive results (except
for some methadone programs), and, even if all drug abusers and
drug-dependent persons had treatment available to them, the
outcome would be uncertain. </p>

<p>There are three general types of treatment modalities for
users of drugs other than heroin. In many urban centers where
drug use flourishes, crisis clinics have been set up to offer
immediate emergency services to drug users and other troubled
youths. They are typically staffed by youths under volunteer
professional direction. They give out drug information, analyze
street samples, &quot;talk down&quot; people with bad reactions,
and see that those in genuine medical danger get to hospitals.
Some also refer persons to long term treatment programs or
themselves offer individual or group therapy to drug users. San
Francisco's Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Clinic is the best-known
example of such clinics now found in many cities. </p>

<p>Therapeutic communities, which operate on the basic assumption
that a character defect causes drug use, treat all drug users
with encounter-group therapy or a more gentle form of &quot;rap
session&quot; therapy. </p>

<p>Users of speed and LSD, and even heavy marijuana users, may
well have underlying psychiatric problems. The only treatment
available for them thus far is the kind of individual or group
therapy used with other mental-health patients. Its success
remains largely unevaluated. </p>

<p>Because heroin is regarded as the most serious drug threat to
society, there has been a much more concentrated effort at
treatment for heroin addicts. In New York City, where probably 50
to 60 per cent of the nation's heroin addicts reside, an
estimated 10 per cent are in some form of treatment. Washington,
D.C., has perhaps 15 per cent of its estimated 15,000 addicts
under treatment. As of October, 1970, there were about fifty
methadone projects throughout the United States serving a total
of about 9,00010,000 persons.' Nationally, it is safe to say that
well over 90 per cent of all heroin addicts are not in any
treatment program at all. </p>

<p>The two main treatment modalities for heroin addicts are (1)
abstinence, bolstered by outpatient or inpatient group therapy,
and (2) methadone maintenance, with or without supportive
services. (A possible third approach is longer-term
&quot;detoxification&quot; with methadone, which is given in
decreasing dosages until the subject is entirely drug-free.) In
New York City, nearly 4,000 heroin users are currently in fifty
residential therapeutic communities, and 5,000-7,000 are
reportedly on methadone. In Washington and Chicago, about half of
all persons in treatment programs are on methadone and half on
abstinence programs. There were, until recently, only a handful
of addicts on methadone in California because of a legal
restriction on its use outside institutions. Some legal
restrictions still exist today. Many other large cities still
have no methadone program at all. </p>

<p>Most methadone programs have long waiting lists. Almost all
treatment programs have selective admission criteria and thus are
probably skimming off the cream of the addict population. They do
not appear to handle the most criminally active and hard-core
addicts. </p>

<p>As compared to abstinence, methadone is clearly showing better
results. Depending upon the degree of prescreening and the amount
of supportive services built into the program, between 45 and 80
per cent of those admitted to methadone programs are successfully
treated, as measured by continuation in the program, decreased
arrests, job stability, and other social indicators.
Experimentation is being tried in a few places with
&quot;barebones&quot; methadone (without supportive services) to
see what portion of the addict population can make it on the
substitute drug alone, without concomitant social-adjustment
help. The most promising approach we have seen is putting both
methadone and nondrug treatment programs under the same
administrative roof. From a research standpoint, this permits
accumulation of a body of data from which a typology may be
developed to show which kind of addict succeeds in which kind of
program. There is some concern, however, that a multimodality
program, combining maintenance and abstinence alternatives, may
confuse patients and reduce the effectiveness of both approaches.
</p>

<p>The more comprehensive the methadone program, and the more
complete the data collection and evaluation, the more costly the
program will be and the fewer patients it will be able to serve.
Costs per patient per year may vary from a high of over $2,000
for a full service program to a low of $500 for a
&quot;barebones&quot; program. </p>

<p>Methadone has thus far been used primarily with older addicts
who have volunteered for treatment. Except in Washington, the
average age of persons in methadone programs has been over
thirty, close to the age when statistics indicate that a sizable
portion of both addicts and criminals tend to &quot;mature
out&quot; of their deviance. Whether methadone will do as well
with an involuntary population of younger age remains to be seen.
</p>

<p>There is a sizable problem of methadone acceptance, especially
in the black community, because of opposition from groups who
view it as a crutch indistinguishable from heroin and a source of
white enslavement of blacks. Detoxification from methadone
maintenance is being tried with a small number of patients. If
this proves successful, the cloud of lifelong dependence now
hanging over methadone will be removed and methadone should prove
more acceptable among blacks. </p>

<p>Another problem is the possibility of &quot;leakage&quot; in
the control system. Diversion of methadone poses a danger, as is
indicated by the death of several non-opiate users who had not
built up a tolerance and who ingested large doses. On the other
hand, methadone appears to be safe for use by addicts in
controlled maintenance programs. </p>

<p>Although all available evidence indicates that methadone is a
safe and effective method of treatment, the federal government
has nevertheless concluded, apparently for policy reasons, to
inhibit its use by giving it only investigational status. This
raises costs and staff requirements and limits the number of
addicts who can be treated. It is unclear what additional
information, if any, would persuade the Food and Drug
Administration to alter this decision.' </p>

<p>Until methadone leaves the research context in which it now
legally resides, its potential parameters will remain unclear.
And just how much federal money will be available in the future
to encourage methadone or multimodality programs in all major
cities is unknown. </p>

<p>Some work is also being done on the nonnarcotic antagonists,
primarily cyclazocine and naloxone, which block the euphoric
effect of heroin. Several hundred people have now used these
antagonist drugs. The chief problems in their use have been the
short duration of action of both drugs-four to eight hours for
naloxone, about the same as heroin, and 22 to 26 hours for
cyclazocine, about the same as methadone-and, until recently,
unpleasant side effects from cyclazocine. Work has been
undertaken on longer-acting antagonists and on an implant that
could discharge the drugs over a period of weeks. The
antagonists, however, apparently do not satisfy the drug craving
as methadone is said to do and have not proved as popular with
addicts. </p>

<p>Other, more conventional methods of treating heroin addiction
appear to have a substantially lower success rate than methadone,
although comparison is difficult because of the differences in
the types of drug users treated, the criteria for success, the
statistics kept, and so forth. </p>

<p>Therapeutic communities like Daytop Village, Odyssey House,
and Phoenix House purport to have up to a 75 per cent success
rate with those who stay in the program, but they do not include
in their figures the large number of addicts (estimated as high
as 50 per cent) who drop out within the first month or two. Dr.
Jerome Jaffee's work in Chicago, which to our knowledge
constitutes one of the few attempts to compare the effectiveness
of methadone and therapeutic communities with the same
population, shows a startlingly greater success with methadone
than with the therapeutic community. Of the 2,500 addicts who
have been treated in the New York City Addiction Services
Agency's Phoenix Houses since 1967, only 130 have graduated back
into community life (and 90 per cent of these work in addiction
programs). An inpatient in such a facility costs $3,000 to $5,000
per year compared to a cost of $500 to $2,000 for a methadone
patient, but methadone may require a longer, or even a permanent,
period of treatment. It seems highly unlikely, in any event, that
there could ever be a sufficient number of residential
therapeutic communities to have a major impact on the problem. </p>

<p>Black community organizations, such as Colonel Hassan's
Blackman's Development Fund and the Bonabond Agency in
Washington, also claim a special ability to keep black addicts
off heroin by abstinence therapy following detoxification with
methadone and appeal to racial pride. But thus far their claims
of success have received no objective evaluation. </p>

<p>NIMH is still committed to comprehensive community mental
health centers as the answer to the drug-treatment problem, but
recent federal legislation for the first time permits support of
drug-treatment programs unaffiliated with these centers. We have
been able to find only a few examples of success with the
community-mental-health-center approach and an equal number of
outright failures. The successful community-mental-health-center,
drug-treatment programs would appear to be just as successful if
they were not affiliated with the centers, and even in theory
there is reason to question the inclusion of drug treatment under
the umbrella of the centers. In any event, we are unable to find
statistics on the effectiveness of this approach. </p>

<p>Virtually everyone agrees that individual psychiatric therapy
not only is impractical because of the large number of addicts
but generally produces poor results with addicts. </p>

<p>There is one method of treatment that has not been attempted
in this country since the Bureau of Narcotics, with the support
of the American Medical Association, stamped it out in the early
1920's-heroin maintenance. At one time, there were some forty
heroin-maintenance clinics in several areas of the country,
unfortunately under rather loose procedures. The Bureau succeeded
in banning them by 1923 and has since done everything possible to
discredit this method of treatment. The suggestion by a
prestigious joint American Bar Association-American Medical
Association Committee in the late 1950's that experimentation
with a heroin clinic program again be undertaken was met with a
vicious attack by the Bureau of Narcotics. During the past five
years, the Bureau of Narcotics (now the Bureau of Narcotics and
Dangerous Drugs) and NIMH have argued that the British system of
narcotics maintenance has utterly failed and could not reasonably
be considered for use in this country. (Staff Paper 7 of this
report, prepared for the Project after an extensive on-site
inspection and investigation, concludes that the British system
of narcotics maintenance appears to have succeeded in containing
the narcotics problem there.) </p>

<p>One outstanding deficiency in the treatment field involves
evaluation. Several treatment programs, mostly
methadone-maintenance programs, have data-collection and
evaluation components. The Dole-Nyswander program in New York has
been intensively evaluated by a prestigious medical committee,
and indeed the evaluation of methadone in various programs
throughout the country has now reached the point where there can
no longer be serious question about the general usefulness of
this treatment approach. The vast majority of the treatment
programs, however, and particularly the non-methadone programs,
have relatively narrow or quite inadequate data-collection and
evaluation components, or no such components whatever. Moreover,
data collection and evaluation are not standardized, with the
result that comparison of programs or techniques for different
patients, taking into account the many possible variables, is
simply not possible at this time. </p>

<p>The Illinois Drug Abuse Rehabilitation Program, under Dr.
Jerome Jaffe, has an unusually sophisticated system of data
collection and analysis combined with a multimodality treatment
program, thus permitting direct comparison of the effectiveness
of different techniques. Similar programs with useful research
components include the Washington, D.C., Narcotics Treatment
Agency, under Dr. Robert Dupont, and the Connecticut Mental
Health Center in New Haven, under Dr. Herbert Kleber. But no such
program has the funds or time to standardize data collection for
all other programs or to persuade others to adopt a uniform
system, much less to attempt to standardize and persuade others
to adopt uniform evaluation criteria. </p>

<p>Without sufficient detailed data collected on a standardized
basis by a substantial number of different projects, there can be
no satisfactory comparative evaluation of various treatment
approaches for different types of drug users. Largely
unsubstantiated and disputed claims of success and failure will
continue to dominate the field until adequate evaluation is
accomplished. </p>

<p>A second deficiency apparent throughout the country is the
lack of enough trained administrators to run treatment programs.
The few outstanding treatment projects emphasize the need for
scholar-administrators with a medical and drug-abuse background
but also with management skills. The most able project directors
do not fall into the typical civil-servant mold but, rather, are
men willing to take gambles and basically to let themselves be
&quot;burned out&quot; in a few years. How to create a reserve of
people equipped with this unique combination of talents and bow
to provide incentives for them to enter the field are critical
questions in the future of treatment. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>LAW ENFORCEMENT</b> </p>

<p>Law enforcement has, of course, been the primary means by
which society has attempted to control drug abuse in the past and
at present appears to represent the principal effort for the
future also. Arrests for drug offenses have increased
dramatically during the past few years, from 31,752 in 1960 to
134,006 in 1968 and over 230,000 in 1969. Such arrests of persons
under eighteen rose from 1,688 in 1960 to 33,091 in 1968 and over
57,000 in 1969. </p>

<p>There is, however, an acknowledged lack of direction and of
trained manpower in state and city efforts, which results in
scant disruption of illicit traffic above the street level. Most
arrests are of users. The principal sellers arrested are
amateurish young softdrug peddlers and addict street dealers.
Studies show that almost all heroin addicts get arrested at least
once every two years of active addiction and spend an average of
15 per cent of their addicted life in jail. In New York City in
June, 1970, there were 4,000 drug arrests compared with 1,800 in
June, 1969. About 60 to 70 per cent of those arrests involved
heroin. In Washington, D.C., arrests doubled in the first six
months of 1970 and now run about four hundred per month; over 50
per cent involved heroin. California reportedly made 150,000 drug
arrests for use and possession in 1969, a 300-per-cent increase
over 1967, and it is unclear whether all of these are reflected
in the national statistics. </p>

<p>BNDD has recently announced that it will provide no more than
consultative services to local police in use, possession or small
trafficking cases, and it is increasingly shifting its resources
to the apprehension of large traffickers. In 1969, its agents
made or instigated 4,000 arrests; for 1971, this figure is
expected to fall to about 1,875. Basically, however, the
criminal-law approach appears to have had little impact on the
growth of the problem, as is demonstrated by the fact that
illegal drug use, by everyone's calculation, is increasing and
shows no signs of leveling off. </p>

<p>The federal government formerly took the position that illegal
drugs that are imported, such as heroin and marijuana, could be
stopped at the border if sufficient resources were allocated to
this effort. In spite of recent large increases in budget and
manpower, however, no significant impact has been made. Border
seizures of heroin amounted to less than 5 per cent of the
estimated imports in 1970. Indeed, the price of heroin has been
falling steadily and the quality increasing, which indicates a
failure to stem the supply. There is strong evidence that
Operation Intercept, the attempt to impede the flow of marijuana
from Mexico into the United States, has resulted in significant
substitution of other drugs for marijuana. </p>

<p>The illegality of heroin is, of course, the sole reason for
its high cost in this country. In England, the pharmacy cost of
heroin is $.04 per grain (60 mg.), or $.00067 per mg. In the
United States, the recent street price is $30-$90 per grain, or
$.50-$1.50 per mg., depending on the time and place of sale and
the quantity and quality of the drug. </p>

<p>As a result of the failure to stop heroin at the border,
recent federal government 'policy has concentrated on cooperation
with foreign governments, primarily Turkey, to reduce their opium
production. Since it is estimated that the United States requires
only 50,000 to 60,000 pounds of opium each year for illicit
heroin use, since this amount is about 1.5 per cent of the total
world production of opium, and since the entire U.S. demand could
probably be met by cultivation of about five square miles of
opium,' and since opium could readily be grown in other parts of
the world, a program based upon suppression of opium production
seems no more likely to succeed than the program based upon
prevention of importation. </p>

<p>Finally, the initial hypothesis that drugs were not
interchangeable-that, for example, a heroin addict would not be
likely to switch to a different drug (e.g., the barbiturates or
amphetamines) if heroin were unavailable-does not appear to be
true. There is evidence that users will freely substitute even
less potent drugs if their drug of choice is not immediately
available. There is a far greater pattern of multiple drug use
than was previously thought to exist. Suppression of one drug for
a period of time, whether long or short, appears, therefore, to
have a limited effect on drug abuse generally. </p>

<p>The law-enforcement approach to drug-abuse problems has been
ameliorated by legislation permitting civil commitment in lieu of
criminal punishment. Under present legislation, however, such
treatment is largely illusory, since it is almost wholly
institutionalized and often results in greater punishment than
would be imposed by a criminal sentence. It is doubtful that
institutionalization under these programs has been markedly more
successful in rehabilitation than criminal sentencing. </p>

<p>New York, California, and the federal government have civil
commitment treatment programs that take a relatively restricted
class of criminal defendants in lieu of prosecution or sentencing
(as well as persons committed voluntarily or by relatives and
others). The New York and California civil-commitment programs
have proved very expensive-$4,000 to $5,000 per patient per year
for care and treatment in New York, and a total of $12,000 for
all costs. About $250 million was spent by New York State in
1967-70, the major share for capital construction and custodial
salaries. Only one out of five patients successfully survives the
parole period in the California program, and less than 25 per
cent the New York program. The federal Narcotic Addict
Rehabilitation Act (NARA) program currently has under 1,000
persons in an outpatient status and 800 in an inpatient status.
Many addicts are ineligible for treatment because of the
restrictive admission criteria contained in the Act, and almost
half of the cases referred for evaluation are rejected because
they are found &quot;not likely to be rehabilitated.&quot; In
general, civil commitment programs have suffered from cumbersome
legal machinery, restrictive admission requirements, inflexible
terms of inpatient residence, expensive security consciousness,
lack of dynamic programs, and active resentment among inmates
because of the prison like climate and poor treatment efforts. </p>

<p>juvenile courts appear to offer one of the most flexible ways
of channeling youthful users into early treatment, yet they are
rarely used for this purpose. Almost all addicts are arrested
first while in their teens. Most juvenile courts already have the
power to divert drug users rapidly to a treatment agency, even
without a formal finding of law violation, and they can keep all
records confidential. Speedy urinalysis and a closer working
relationship between juvenile courts and community treatment
programs might have an impact on the problem. Ordinary juvenile
institutions are less useful. They are experiencing an increasing
problem with contraband drugs (we have been told that many youths
get their first drug experiences there), and few, if any, have
drug education or therapy programs, or indeed any urinalysis
surveillance, after inmates leave the institution. </p>

<p>The federal government (as well as local and state police
agencies) has been severely criticized for devoting its
law-enforcement efforts to drug users and addict pushers and
failing to prosecute large drug wholesalers. In New York and
Washington, and probably elsewhere as well, grassroots
organizations claim to know the identity of the larger
wholesalers and in some instances state that they have turned
information over to law-enforcement officials without results. </p>

<p>The short working life of undercover agents, the large amounts
of cash necessary to make substantial &quot;buys,&quot; and the
structure of the heroin market, which is designed to insulate
higher figures from contact with the drug, are the reasons most
commonly cited by law-enforcement and community officials for the
paucity of results in disrupting the heroin traffic. But the
factor more commonly cited by ghetto groups, and increasingly
also by such respected citizens as former Chief justice Earl
Warren, is corruption of narcotics agents. More than thirty
federal agents were reportedly indicted on bribery and
narcotics-sale charges during 1969 and 1970. The view is endemic
in ghetto areas-and apparently it is justified at least in
part-that the federal, state, and local police are not doing
their job, and that they should be able to arrest more dealers
and distributors than they do. Although it may be partly a
question of better training, direction at the top, and placement
of a higher priority in the area, there may also be widespread
corruption involving pay-offs at the lower levels between police
and pushers. </p>

<p>Both previous and present federal drug statutes make
possession of an illegal drug of abuse a crime. When the Drug
Abuse Control Amendments of 1965 were enacted to cover nonopiate
drugs, possession for personal use was not made a crime, but this
was changed in 1968 because of the LSD scare. The legislation
enacted by Congress in 1970 to recodify and modernize all the
federal drug-abuse laws continues the policy of making possession
a criminal offense, with a one-year maximum sentence for
possession of any illegal drug and twice this term for second and
subsequent offenses. Neither prior law nor new legislation
provides that an addict is not criminally liable for possession
of a drug to support his habit. Test cases are being litigated to
develop this defense as a matter of constitutional or common law,
and the staff of the National Commission on Reform of Federal
Criminal Laws has proposed that this should in any event be a
statutory defense. Congressional support for such a defense
would, however, appear difficult to obtain. </p>

<p>Regardless of judicial or legislative reform, it appears that
the law-enforcement process will remain a significant, and
probably by far the most important, intake unit for
drug-dependent people for many years to come. At present only a
few, crude attempts are being made to utilize this intake path to
channeling addicts into useful treatment programs outside the
civil commitment procedures. </p>

<p>Drug users are generally processed as ordinary criminals, and,
conversely, a large percentage of ordinary criminals, when tested
by urinalysis, are found to be drug users. Urinalysis tests in
the criminal courts and detention facilities of major urban
centers show that one-third to one-half of all criminal
defendants, including juveniles, are currently using drugs, and
some estimate that 80 per cent of the serious property crime in
Washington, D.C., is committed by drug users. The likelihood that
a criminally processed drug user will be given any specific
treatment during his incarceration is slight. But even more
basic, attempts at treatment programs in the prison setting have
been markedly unsuccessful. Indeed, there is evidence that many
nonusers or experimenters are first introduced to drug use or
have their habits reinforced while in prison. One survey showed
that 90 to 95 per cent of the heroin addicts who leave prison
without treatment follow-up lapse almost immediately into drug
use. Many of the major urban areas now have parole programs that
test for drug use through urinalysis, and a few offer parolees
methadone, group-therapy, and/or halfway-house programs.
Nonmethadone programs with probationers and parolees, however,
have not proved very successful. The majority of such
probationers and parolees have had to be returned to prisons or
court for drug violations. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>LEADERSHIP</b> </p>

<p>It is our belief that a major reason for the confusion and
division within the drug-abuse field and the country in general
is the lack of effective leadership, on both a governmental and a
nongovernmental level. Effective leadership, by our definition,
includes such functions as keeping the country informed about
drug abuse and the latest drug research and arranging an open
climate for medical and social research and for reasonable
experimentation with different models of control. Effective
leadership should, further, avoid eliciting emotional public
reaction to isolated incidents and attempt to remove the drug
problem from national politics. </p>

<p>Within the federal government, there are three organizations
substantially concerned with drug abuse: BNDD, NIMH, and the
Department of Defense.&quot; </p>

<p>BNDD has for years pursued a national approach to drug abuse
characterized by suppression of illegal drugs and the enforcement
of criminal penalties for drug abusers. Although Bureau officials
now emphasize the need for rehabilitation, the basic policy
position of BNDD has not been significantly altered. The
legislation recodifying federal drug-abuse laws, drafted by BNDD
and passed by Congress in October, 1970, represents little change
in fundamental narcotics policy and only reinforces and codifies
existing law (except for some modification of penalties). The
reason for the recodification, indeed, was not a desire for
reform but a need to repair legislative provisions voided by the
Supreme Court on constitutional grounds. </p>

<p>The new law still includes marijuana and heroin in the same
classification, provides a uniform penalty for possession of any
illegal drug, and contains such harsh sanctions as a thirty-year
maximum prison sentence for an eighteen-year-old with a prior
offense who sells marijuana to a twenty-year-old friend if there
is any profit involved in the transaction. Any change in the
basic BNDD approach of penalizing drug abuse seems highly
unlikely in the near future. </p>

<p>During the past two crucial years of public-policy
development, NIMH has been singularly impotent as an independent
voice in policy decisions and has seemingly been forced to accede
to the BNDD approach of relying almost exclusively upon law
enforcement. There is no reason to believe that NIMH will be
given substantially more leeway in putting forward policy
alternatives in the immediate future. Although there are a number
of NIMH personnel working on drug abuse who do favor a more
flexible and health-oriented approach toward drug users and who
would promote such an approach if allowed and encouraged to do
so, a significant change in federal policy is required before
they can be expected to speak out publicly on these matters. </p>

<p>Until mid-1970, the Department of Defense denied that there
was any drug-abuse problem at all in the military. It has now
admitted that drug abuse does indeed exist in the armed services
and is initiating a program for treating users as an alternative
to punishment and dishonorable discharge. </p>

<p>Legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Senate to
liberalize treatment under the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation
Act, to revitalize the narcotics work of NIMH, and to authorize a
far more comprehensive health, welfare, and rehabilitation
approach to the problems of drug abuse by the federal government.
But even if such legislation is enacted, the present
administration's emphasis on the law-enforcement approach could
undermine its effective implementation. </p>

<p>The state government picture varies, of course, from state to
state. Suffice it to say that, thus far, few states have refused
to follow the lead of BNDD with respect to narcotics policy and
that of the U.S. Congress with respect to narcotics legislation.
As an example of the current climate, the August, 1970,
Conference of Uniform State Law Commissioners approved a draft of
a uniform state drug-abuse law, prepared by a BNDD attorney, with
the understanding that it could be revised before final
publication to reflect any appropriate changes in light of
federal legislation then pending in Congress. An earlier draft,
based upon what BNDD had hoped to have passed by Congress, was
enacted by two states before the final version was available. </p>

<p>The nongovernmental organizations interested in the field of
drug abuse have not exerted significant leadership during the
past two years. During this critical time of public-policy
determination, professional, medical, and scientific
organizations such as the American Bar Association, the American
Medical Association, the American Public Health Association, and
the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council have
spoken out only on specific issues of interest to them and only
on isolated occasions. Because all these organizations deal only
tangentially with drug abuse and must rely for their efforts
primarily on busy professionals who have full-time jobs outside
the organization, none of them could be expected to exert the
effective leadership that is needed in this field. </p>

<p>There is no national voluntary citizens' organization in the
field of drug abuse comparable to the National Council of
Alcoholism (NCA), and NCA has recently decided that it will enter
this field only to consider problems in which drug abuse and
alcoholism interact. Both the North American Association of
Alcoholism Programs and the National Association of State Mental
Health Program Directors, which are organizations representing
state tax-supported agencies, also deal only tangentially with
drug abuse and have made no serious effort to become concerned
with the field in detail. </p>

<p>Largely because of this void, a paper organization, the
Committee for Effective Drug Abuse Legislation, was created to
represent the medical-scientific viewpoint before Congress during
the hearings on the new drug-abuse legislation. Since this
organization has been concerned almost exclusively with the
freedom to conduct research and is poorly funded, it has had to
ignore many other important public-policy issues. </p>

<p>Another new organization is the previously mentioned National
Coordinating Council on Drug Abuse Education and Information,
created in 1969 to bring together virtually all national
organizations, from the drug industry to consumer groups, and
from the PTA to the National Student Association, for the purpose
of developing an effective drug-abuse education program. Although
the Coordinating Council is financed to a significant extent by
the federal government and has governmental representatives on
its board of directors, it has shown independence and a reasoned
approach to education and community planning in the drug field.
The Coordinating Council's achievements are largely the work of a
very few people, however, and, because of its precarious
financial underpinnings, it is uncertain how long and how
vigorously it can continue its efforts. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>A MORE PROMISING APPROACH TO DRUG ABUSE</b> </p>

<p>The foregoing summary discloses a lack of leadership in the
field of drug abuse, a law-enforcement approach that is often
ineffective and even harmful, and a country deeply and even
bitterly divided over the proper approach to drug abuse. We
believe that an effective attack on drug abuse can be launched
only in a climate of reason and tolerance, allowing us to discern
the real evils of drug abuse while rejecting policies based on
confusion, misinformation, and emotion. </p>

<p>Before we can begin to cope adequately with drug-abuse
problems, therefore, we must begin to refine and clarify our
thinking about them. The world is full of drugs, large numbers of
which are psychoactive. The majority of adult Americans take
alcohol as a tension reliever or to facilitate social
intercourse, and the use of nonprescription and prescription
drugs for similar purposes is endemic. The availability and
variety of these drugs will probably not only continue but
increase. </p>

<p>Many of the drugs used have profound therapeutic benefits that
allow people to offset physical or mental pathology and function
more normally. Few of us would be willing to forego these
therapeutic benefits, and no one perceives the use of drugs to
achieve normal functioning as abuse. An increasingly large number
of people, however, are not willing to limit their drug taking to
medically supervised attempts to offset pathology. Some engage in
self-medication with drugs they have become acquainted with
through legitimate medical use. This pattern often occurs in the
case of tranquilizers. Some wish to escape an unwelcome reality
with heroin or barbiturates. Others desire the very acute
functioning associated with the amphetamines. Still others,
especially the young, seek the pleasurable effects of
hallucinogens or marijuana. </p>

<p>The basic philosophy underlying our present drug-control laws
is that all of these self-induced effects are to be shunned, or
at least are not to be sought through drugs other than alcohol.
This is a decision based partly on the fear of actual physical
damage caused by the drugs, but primarily on the belief that
drugs damage society because they contribute to crime and
alienation. </p>

<p>It seems inevitable to us that all segments of society will
continue to be exposed to a myriad of drugs in the future, and
that society must learn to cope with these chemicals as part of
everyday life. It is not possible at present to foresee exactly
how the necessary adjustments in social attitudes and policies
will be made. </p>

<p>We do feel, however, that current national policy-which
singles out particular drugs and makes their possession or use a
crime-should be changed for very important empirical reasons. We
believe that the individual and social harm caused by imposing
criminal sanctions on drug users far outstrips the benefits of
this approach. Handling drug users as criminals has created
widespread disrespect for the drug laws, has resulted in
selective enforcement, has possibly done more to encourage than
to discourage illegal drug use, has undercut bona fide efforts to
explain the important differences among various drugs in the
physical and mental damage they cause, and has deterred drug
abusers from seeking necessary help. We feel that, as a first
step in bringing the problem back into perspective, criminal
penalties for possession of illegal drugs for personal use only
should be abandoned in many jurisdictions. If this were done,
drug users but not drug traffickers-could then be handled on a
public health and social-welfare basis. Like the Canadian LeDain
Commission on Non-Medical Use of Drugs, which in its April, 1970,
Interim Report recommended retention of only a perfunctory $100
fine for illegal possession of drugs as an interim measure
pending issuance of its final report, we have seen no evidence
that eliminating the criminal penalties for possession of illegal
drugs for personal use would materially impede the effectiveness
of law-enforcement efforts against trafficking or remove an
incentive for drug users to seek treatment or have other
unfortunate consequences. </p>

<p>This conclusion in no way depends on a belief that chemicals
should be freely used to induce pleasure. Nor do we believe that
it is necessary to await final resolution of the currently
popular debate about whether alcohol or marijuana is the more
dangerous drug, a debate that has succeeded only in provoking
further generational confrontation about hypocrisy,
permissiveness, and life styles. Most of those who advocate a
public-health approach disapprove strongly of the unsupervised
use of dangerous drugs, especially by young people. Our
conclusion is based, rather, on a recognition that our present
methods of handling the drug abuser are at best ineffective and
at worst counterproductive, and that other approaches must be
tried. Eliminating criminal penalties for possession for personal
use would neither legalize a particular drug nor permit its use.
Law-enforcement efforts would, and in our opinion should,
continue, but they would be directed at illegal distribution. And
illegal drugs would remain subject to confiscation wherever
found. </p>

<p>If the confrontation over the role of the criminal law in
enforcing private moral judgments or choices of drugs were
eliminated, the country might be able to unite behind an
intensified approach to research, prevention, treatment, and law
enforcement directed against the upper echelons of the illegal
drug traffic. Restrictions on scientific research inquiries into
particular drugs might then be lifted and substantial public and
private funds more easily directed toward the understanding of
how drugs work on the mind and body and what effects, both short
and long term, they produce. Education of young people against
the reckless use of powerful substances that affect the mind
could proceed in a free and open climate more calculated to
influence their behavior. </p>

<p>As research discloses more about specific drugs, some might
eventually become candidates for limited legalization, in the
pattern now used for alcohol. In other cases, disclosure of
severe or permanent damage to the mind or body would require that
distribution controls remain under criminal penalty. With such
potentially harmful drugs, the user who refuses to accept
treatment, and who can be shown to constitute a danger to others,
might be committed civilly for appropriate treatment. </p>

<p>Voluntary treatment for harmful effects of drugs could
similarly be made more flexible and accessible under such a
system. Restrictions against any experimentation with heroin
maintenance and unjustified limitations on the use of methadone
maintenance could be reviewed and possibly removed. More public
funds would be devoted to current treatment efforts and to
searching out new treatment methods, to permit adequate handling
of all voluntary and involuntary patients. </p>

<p>Finally, law enforcement could continue to act as an intake
unit for treatment programs for those drug abusers accused of
minor trafficking or other crimes. Where the drug taking results
in dangerous antisocial acts, it is not unjust to require the
offender to undergo treatment as a condition of liberty or even
to offer it to him within the confines of the institution. But
law enforcement's main focus would be directed at illegal drug
wholesalers. In this endeavor, it would have the wholehearted
backing of vast numbers of Americans, young and old alike. </p>

<hr>

<p><font size="5"><b>THE DRUG ABUSE COUNCIL</b></font> </p>

<p>In the previous section, we outlined an alternative approach
to drug abuse that we believe is more promising than the present
national approach. Private foundations do not have the means
fully to implement such an alternative approach, nor could they
legally do all that would be required to bring it about. A
foundation cannot, for example, properly engage in efforts to
change legislation. On the other hand, pursuit of the public
welfare is a well-recognized task of all private foundations, and
an important aspect of the approach described above involves
education, research, and related activities that have long
concerned private foundations. The basic goal might be summarized
as one intended to make national drug-abuse policy responsive to
facts rather than emotion. This is clearly an area where
foundations could properly play a very large role. </p>

<p>Our primary recommendation is that an independent, nonprofit
Drug Abuse Council be established to fill the leadership void
that now exists in all areas of the drug-abuse field. This would
preferably be undertaken as a joint project by a number of
private foundations and organizations. The Council would strive
to become a vitally needed center of excellence for drug-abuse
information, basic research, education, and prevention,
evaluation of treatment and education programs, and related
activities. </p>

<p>The federal government is not equipped to perform this
function. Its activities in the drug-abuse field are fairly
narrowly circumscribed by political necessities, it relies
largely on recruitment of civil-service personnel even at the top
leadership levels, and its financial commitments are short term
and subject to the vagaries of Congressional and administration
decisions. Federal activities in the drug-abuse field tend to be
ad hoc reactions to current crises, such as the 1970 crash
drug-education program in response to the well-publicized death
of a twelve-year-old heroin addict, rather than well-considered,
long-term programs. </p>

<p>Assuming that drug abuse will exist for years to come, and
that the country's policies should be grounded on fact and reason
rather than on emotion and politics, a long-range investment in
education, research, and treatment is necessary. The Drug Abuse
Council would be a long-term (ten years at a minimum) effort to
obtain the factual information needed to provide a basis for
sound policy and to disseminate to the public and to persons in
key policy positions the best knowledge available in the field
and the best analysis of this knowledge as it pertains to current
programs. </p>

<p>The Council would have a board of 10 to 15 trustees. Working
under the board's direction would be an interdisciplinary staff
responsible for performing the Council's daily work, headed by a
full-time president. The president would be a member of the Board
of Trustees, but not its chairman. </p>

<p>The majority of the Board of Trustees should be professionals
knowledgeable in the field of drug abuse. A few might be
prestigious figures in the national scene, but persons who would
commit themselves to a heavy working schedule consisting at a
minimum of one formal meeting a month and substantial contact
with the staff between meetings. </p>

<p>The Board of Trustees should include representatives of
medicine, psychiatry, pharmacology, education, community
leadership, law, and sociology. Board members would be
appropriately compensated for their time and efforts. The
chairman of the board should probably be located in, or
accessible to, the city where the Council's headquarters are
located-preferably Washington, D.C.-and he should be
appropriately compensated for his additional work. </p>

<p>The president would initially work out with the board the
direction for the Council's first efforts. He would then recruit
his staff and proceed to implement those directives by drawing up
a detailed set of proposals for Council action. </p>

<p>The initial core of the Council staff might consist of a
medically trained person (probably a psychiatrist), a basic
researcher in the biochemical field, a social scientist, a
lawyer, and an editor writer schooled in simplifying technical
writing. This small nucleus could, of course, be expanded as the
Council's president and board define priorities and activities. </p>

<p>It is obvious that the President must be a key personality,
with proved administrative ability, and soundly grounded in the
drug abuse field, its politics, personalities, and peculiar
history. He would be responsible for proposing projects to the
board, arranging for their financing or administration, preparing
draft reports for board consideration, and so forth. Successful
implementation of the Council's objectives would depend to a
degree on the president's capabilities. </p>

<p>The relationship of the staff to the Board of Trustees also
deserves comment. Basically, there seem to be three types of
staff-board working relationships. First, a board of trustees may
operate as a figurehead, exercising minimal influence over the
activities of the staff. Secondly, it may have broad policy- and
priority-setting powers but leave most operating decisions to the
working group. This requires a far greater commitment of time by
the members of the board than the first relationship. Finally,
the board may directly run the organization through a staff
having little or no independent decision-making capabilities. In
essence, this third type of relationship would require the
melding of the board of trustees with the working group. </p>

<p>In the case of the Council, it appears that the most
productive staff-board relationship would be the second type-a
Board of Trustees with policy authority over the working group
but not actively involved in the actual day-to-day operations of
the group. Such a board would have an important role. Because of
the controversial nature of the drug field, board members must be
prepared personally to back Council projects and policy
statements and to withstand the inevitable attacks almost from
the day they convene. If the Council's pronouncements and work
are to carry weight in professional and governmental circles and
among the general public, the board must stand solidly behind
them. </p>

<p>Once under way, the Council should explore the potential for
action in many different areas. The following representative
list, which reflects areas of current immediate concern, is not
intended to exhaust the possibilities. Additional matters will be
uncovered, and priorities will change, as developments occur in
the field that cannot be predicted at this time. </p>

<p>Finally, it should be noted that the Council may carry out its
objectives either by persuading others to undertake and finance
the work or by underwriting the work itself. Whenever possible,
the Council should encourage federal, state, and local
governments to increase their roles in drug-abuse programs. In
this respect, the Council should act as a watchdog, to make
certain that public agencies fulfill their intended
responsibilities. In many instances, however, private action,
either funded or undertaken directly by the Council, will also be
necessary and appropriate. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>SPONSORSHIP OF BASIC RESEARCH</b> </p>

<p>Although not nearly enough is known about the effects of drugs
on the mind and body, the investment of new research funds must
be carefully directed toward specific objectives, rather than
merely toward supplementing federal funds. Some knowledgeable
people are dubious about what could be accomplished by the
contribution of a few million dollars in private research funds.
Nevertheless, we believe that there are finite areas of basic
research that the Council could profitably explore. </p>

<p>Encouragement of Interdisciplinary Research. Universities,
where most basic research is done, tend to be structured along
departmental lines. The incentive structures for researchers and,
even more important, for graduate students tend to force the
researcher to stay within his area and not become part of an
interdisciplinary group. The Council might usefully promote
centers of interdisciplinarianism in this field. </p>

<p>There are cogent reasons for encouraging interdisciplinary
research. The question of why the same amount of drug ingested by
the same person produces dramatically different effects in
different settings puzzles scientists and must be studied outside
the laboratory as well as within, by psychologists and social
scientists as well as by pharmacologists. Many of the basic
pharmacological studies on the effects of heroin or methadone
should be attached to treatment programs, so that the subjects
could be studied and tested in the environment and under the
conditions in which they become and remain drug-dependent. Some
of the most creative hypotheses for basic research come from the
cross-fertilization of different disciplines thinking about the
same problem from different approaches. This is the kind of
innovative exposure that the federal government's research
program, based on the funding of finite projects to explore
already articulated hypotheses, does not at present have the
capacity to encourage. </p>

<p>One way of supporting this type of work would be to establish
a new in-house center for the scientific study of drug abuse on
an interdisciplinary basis. Another would be to put money into
the best existing university centers, on the condition that they
make some effort to study drugs of abuse in the context of their
over-all work. </p>

<p>Of these two courses, the second seems preferable. A number of
first-class researchers in a relevant field may not regard drug
abuse as their primary area of interest or as an area on which
they would wish to concentrate their full time, and in any event
they might not wish to move. The best researchers in the field
might be more willing to study drug abuse, either separately or
along with other matters of interest to them scientifically, if
permitted to remain at their present location. To a large extent,
this means funding interdisciplinary efforts in universities,
because that is where the best researchers are currently found. </p>

<p>In addition to multidisciplinary research in universities, it
might also be productive to fund a narcotics-research section in
an existing institution or simply to fund individual projects
wherever the best researchers exist. Finally, the Council might
wish to participate in an ongoing treatment program for the
unique information that the program might provide with a
reasonable additional investment in a research component. Such
questions as why heroin addicts stabilize at different levels of
methadone dosage and whether long-term tissue changes are caused
by a variety of drugs are often researched best with a large
treatment population at hand. Each of these possibilities must be
explored in greater detail by the Council staff before final
recommendations can be made. </p>

<p>Detection of Drugs in the Body. Pharmacologists have informed
us that the basic problem of drug detection in the body where
drugs go, how long they stay, what metabolites they produce, and
what happens to them-is not being studied in the way present
methodology would permit if research funds were available to
perfect it. The technology of drug detection is an area that is
very important to research but is not a high-priority item for
any single researcher or university because the benefits are
largely external to any particular project. This type of
technological development would be of value to all researchers
working in basic pharmacology. It would also enable the accurate
identification of drugs in cases of acute toxic reaction and thus
the development of better methods of treating or preventing such
toxic reaction. </p>

<p>Research in this area could also be directed toward
development of more accurate, rapid, and inexpensive equipment
for a variety of purposes. Of particular importance for both
law-enforcement and treatment programs is the chemical analysis
of urine specimens to detect heroin and other illegal drugs.
Urinalysis is used in broad surveillance programs in determining
whether bail should be set for criminals, in probation and parole
surveillance, in methadone-maintenance programs, and indeed in
virtually all types of drug-treatment programs. It is essential
to any evaluation of the success of these programs. Yet, in many
burgeoning methadone programs, such as that in Minneapolis, no
prompt and cheap urine testing is available, and samples must be
mailed hundreds of miles for analysis. </p>

<p>There is substantial doubt whether surveillance programs are
in all instances lawful, and even whether their use is productive
or counterproductive with respect to treatment results. It will
be some time before final answers can be obtained to these
questions. Meanwhile, it is clear that urinalysis surveillance is
increasing and will continue to increase (particularly if it is
made mandatory for all methadone programs, as has been proposed).
The problem is that urinalysis detection techniques can be
costly, inaccurate, and very time-consuming. They may therefore
limit the number of patients who can be admitted to treatment
programs because of the cost involved in continuous urinalysis
surveillance, wrong decisions may be made because of the
erroneous results obtained, and persons may be deprived of
liberty, placed under suspicion, or not given adequate treatment
for long periods of time while awaiting results. </p>

<p>BNDD and a few private companies reportedly are interested in
improving technology and methodology in this area, and there are
some indications of progress. One company has apparently produced
a marketable electronic device that would improve the speed and
reliability of urinalysis but not reduce the cost. We have been
assured that the technology for cheaper, reliable urinalysis is
available but requires an initial investment to produce the
models. Reducing the cost per unit from $1 to $2 to $.50 or less
could mean a savings of $.25 million for large-scale projects and
more for a city offering centralized urinalysis for all its
programs. Hopefully, the Council could persuade the federal
government to make the initial investment of a few hundred
thousand dollars to conduct this work, if the need is not
otherwise met in the near future. </p>

<p>Interaction of Different Drugs Taken in Combination. Large
numbers of drug abusers use several drugs, some legal and some
illegal, together or in substitution for another. The net effect
of their interaction may be quite different from that of either
one used alone. (There is some indication, for example, that
heavy barbiturate use may neutralize the effect of birth-control
pills used simultaneously.) Research on drug interaction could
lead to knowledge that might prevent toxic fatalities. </p>

<p>Research with Heroin and Heroin Maintenance. We are unaware of
any significant experimentation with heroin in this country,
either in animals or in humans. Such research would be
potentially very valuable in determining such questions as how an
addict stabilizes on any given dose of heroin, how well he
functions in society when consistently maintained on his drug,
how wide a range of variation in dosage can be given without
withdrawal, whether some people can use heroin indefinitely
without becoming addicted, and how long a person must use a given
dosage of heroin in order to become addicted. The usage patterns
of different types of heroin addict also remain a mystery and
have important research implications for treatment and education.
Research on such issues as these might well have to combine field
investigation and medical diagnosis. </p>

<p>One of the first problems the Council would face if it decided
such research was desirable would be obtaining the necessary
federal and state government permission, setting up the research
in a way that would satisfy medical ethics, and justifying the
need for the work to the public. </p>

<p>Miscellaneous. Another vital area not now being adequately
researched is the effect of drugs, including marijuana and
methadone, taken by pregnant women on the behavior and physical
characteristics of the child. </p>

<p>A high-priority question is whether there is either an inborn
physiological predilection to opiate addiction (as Dr. Dole
suggests) or a drug-induced physiological readdiction
vulnerability (as Dr. Martin suggests) or a learned response to
external stimuli (as Dr. Wickler suggests) or none of these.
Although we are not certain how this can be made the subject of a
directed research project, it is a question of the greatest
importance to the direction of treatment efforts, drug education,
and even legal responsibility for addictive behavior. An attempt
should be made to devise a series of experiments to advance this
kind of research. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>FUNDING PROGRAMS RELATING TO TREATMENT AND RESEARCH WITH
RESPECT TO TREATMENT</b> </p>

<p>We recommend that the Council should not, as a general rule,
fund ongoing treatment programs, except insofar as they make
possible unique research efforts not otherwise available. The
Council's efforts in this area should instead be directed
primarily toward providing the public climate necessary to assure
appropriate public financing of any drug-abuse or drug-dependence
treatment programs that are found worthy of support. As a
practical matter, Council funds could not begin to match the
amount of funding available from federal and state sources, if
those sources could be persuaded to allocate appropriate amounts
for treatment. </p>

<p>The failure of the Council to support ongoing treatment
programs will undoubtedly subject it to criticism from community
action leaders. We feel, however, that the Council should have
the more fundamental role of generating public support for drug
abuse programs and supporting and conducting research and
evaluation that will begin to establish criteria by which the
effectiveness of these programs can be measured. The Council
should, further, disseminate information throughout the country
with respect to programs that have proved to be worthwhile and
that, therefore, will have a broad and long-range national
impact. </p>

<p>The Council should, however, be on the lookout for truly
experimental and research-oriented treatment programs that,
absent nongovernmental support, will not be undertaken. Areas
that deserve careful consideration include the following: </p>

<p>Basic Field Work in Programs for juveniles and Hard-Core
Addicts. The populations least successfully treated are juvenile
drug abusers and hard-core addicts for whom all known treatment
methods have repeatedly failed. In our present state of almost
total ignorance as to what kind of prevention or treatment
programs will work with these populations, it may be necessary to
send people out into the field to study the problem for six
months to a year and then to come back and design operational
program models. There is to our knowledge no present source of
funding for any such basic field approach in new prevention or
treatment techniques. Prototype projects designed to test
specific hypotheses resulting from such field investigations
might then be recommended for operation by federal, state, or
local governments. </p>

<p>Heroin Maintenance. A related area that definitely seems worth
exploring would be an experiment with heroin maintenance. A
detailed study of heroin maintenance in the United States before
it was stamped out by the Bureau of Narcotics and of the
heroin-maintenance techniques that have been utilized in England
should undoubtedly precede initiation of such experimentation in
this country. </p>

<p>Research with respect to heroin maintenance-its possible use
as a bait to get young addicts into other forms of treatment, its
possible use as long-term maintenance for addicts who have
repeatedly failed with other treatment methods, and other
potential uses-might be a high-priority item for the Council. </p>

<p>As already noted, a substantial driving force behind the
present public concern about heroin addiction is the fear of
drug-related crime. Assuming that not all addicts can be
rehabilitated, and indeed that the addiction problem will remain
at least as great for some years to come, the hypothesis that
drug addiction leads to crime and that a major portion of our
crime wave is attributable to the high price of heroin must be
put to the test. Such a controlled experiment could determine
whether, using a heroin maintenance system, crime is indeed
reduced. The superiority of methadone over heroin, or vice versa,
in maintenance programs could also be explored for the first
time. </p>

<p>Management Assistance to Ongoing Programs. The Council might
also consider providing ongoing or nascent treatment programs
with desperately needed managerial assistance. A team of
management consultants who could look at local programs and
persuade their administrators to adopt proven techniques and
perhaps to create a data-acquisition and digestion system where
appropriate would be a major contribution to good treatment. The
few successful project administrators we have seen are working
full time in their own projects and cannot spend the necessary
months advising other projects. Many methadone programs are
subject to justified criticism, and a resultant loss of money,
because of sloppy or uninformed management practices or failure
to keep and record their data accurately. The kind of service we
propose could reduce such needless problems. </p>

<p>Regional Networks. Finally, the Council might work with states
and cities to help treatment centers from regional networks to
share knowledge and experience, and even to cross-refer patients
for specialized attention. This kind of regional network could
also make cross-comparisons of variable techniques easier and
allow interchange of personnel and pooling of funds for
urinalysis, data collection, and training programs for personnel.
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>EVALUATION OF TREATMENT APPROACHES</b> </p>

<p>Several different treatment approaches are in use today. There
is also massive distrust among these programs, misinformation as
to what is and is not being done, and a lack of any reliable
means to separate truth from fiction. Evaluation approaches and
criteria for the various programs are not standardized, and basic
data often are not kept. Even when it exists, useful material is
often not organized or published. It is therefore virtually
impossible at this time to compare the effectiveness of any one
approach with any other, or to study the effectiveness of a given
approach for different types of patients. Because of lack of
evaluative data, we do not know, for example, whether and to what
degree the concurrent use of social services increases the
effectiveness of methadone, or the per them cost of patient
treatment under different programs correlated with the rate of
rehabilitation, or the dropout rate under various treatment
programs, or the type of person (age, pattern of drug use, race,
economic background) who volunteers for and is best handled under
various treatment programs. There is a great need for an
impartial body to attempt standardization of evaluation criteria
and techniques nationally and to disseminate the results of
objective evaluation of ongoing programs in order to promote the
most useful components of these approaches and discourage
ineffective and unproductive efforts. </p>

<p>One approach that the Council might consider in attacking the
information gap is to develop a uniform data-processing system
for drug-abuse projects and to provide several of the programs
with the necessary software and consultative services to install
such a system. Local treatment programs must participate actively
in working out a good data-evaluation system if they are to be
persuaded to cooperate. The results of the data collection might
be fed to a central receiving station where Council experts could
analyze it and interpret its meaning to the individual programs
as well as to other interested parties. </p>

<p>The decision as to what criteria should be used to evaluate
any treatment program, however, involves not merely data analysis
but basic value judgments based on experience. The Council should
be involved in setting these criteria. Major methadone programs,
for example, have been attacked because some of the participants
continue to use drugs intermittently. This raises the question of
whether eschewing all illegal drugs should be the sole or even
the primary goal for a treatment program, or whether enhanced
social functioning and cessation of antisocial acts, such as
stealing, are sufficient criteria for success. If the Council
could contribute toward formulating uniform criteria that reflect
a realistic and flexible perspective on what treatment programs
can be expected to accomplish and in what period of time, and on
the immediate and long-term nature of some of the goals of
treatment, it would be doing a tremendously worthwhile job. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>INFORMATION DISSEMINATION</b> </p>

<p>Technical Information. Technical personnel in the field,
researchers, treatment project personnel, and educators need a
comprehensive and accessible service that they can tap for
complete, accurate, and up-to-date information on specific
aspects of drug abuse, such as treatment proj ects, ongoing or
past research, model school curricula, or film listings. There
are at present several fragmented attempts to provide this kind
of informational coverage. On request, NIMH will supply, through
its National Clearinghouse for Drug Abuse Information, selected
material on drug-abuse problems. Within about six months, it is
hoped that the Clearinghouse will be able to provide a computer
printout of abstracts of all publications on any subject
requested, concentrating on publications appearing within the
last decade, and without evaluation of content. Because the NIMH
Clearinghouse is a government service, it feels that it cannot
exercise any discrimination in the articles it abstracts, and
hence it often abstracts worthless material or several virtually
identical publications of the same author in different
periodicals. NIMH also sends periodically, to certain persons,
the protocols of research grants in progress. The National
Coordinating Council on Drug Abuse Education and Information is
planning a looseleaf service to include information on treatment
projects, legislation, films, and what is known about the nature
and effect of individual drugs of abuse, but is not sure how
complete it can be because of budget problems. </p>

<p>Ideally, there should be one comprehensive index and digest of
all this material, perhaps in several looseleaf volumes, and
preferably one that is not prepared by the federal government. It
should encompass virtually all information pertinent to the
field, including a reasonably selective cross-indexed review or
abstract of past and present books, articles, reports, and
scientific papers, reprints from nineteenth- and early
twentieth-century literature on experiences with drug abuse that
are otherwise not generally available, descriptions of current
treatment and research projects, public-opinion polls and drug
surveys, evaluated lists of educational materials, digests of
laws, court decisions, and legislative proposals, and other
material. The compilation of such a digest and its periodic
updating would be an enormous undertaking, and one that might be
best accomplished by subsidizing another organization to do the
actual work. The relationship between the Council and the
editorial board of such a publication would have to be resolved. </p>

<p>Another important way of disseminating and highlighting the
best of current research findings is through a technical journal,
circulated largely to physicians, scientists, and other
specialists in the field. The Institute for the Study of Drug
Addiction, in New York, currently publishes the International
journal of the Addictions, which covers both alcoholism and drug
abuse. We have found this journal a very useful source of basic
information. The publishers state that the very limited number of
papers and abstracts, and the very small circulation, are due to
a lack of funds. </p>

<p>There seems to be no reason to set up a second journal of this
type. Subject to further exploration of this matter, we believe
that the Council should give serious consideration to working
with the Institute for the Study of Drug Addiction to expand the
articles and abstracts in their journal in order to cover the
field adequately (excluding alcoholism, which is covered well
enough in a separate journal), to make the journal a monthly
publication, and to increase its circulation. This would provide
the field with the detailed results of all significant research
on a current basis. </p>

<p>School Drug-Education Programs. The role of the Council in the
race to the schoolhouse must be approached with care. The
consensus is that private and public organizations are now
generating too many drug-education programs without sufficient
knowledge of basic educational techniques, pretesting, or
evaluation of results. </p>

<p>There are not enough professional educators sufficiently
schooled in drug abuse to teach teachers about drugs. Very often
we have found that those who teach counselors and others
responsible for drug education in the schools have themselves had
no training except for a few lectures. It may be that the Council
can affect this vacuum through support of university
interdisciplinary research that can train a cadre of experts to
teach the teachers in the universities and surrounding
communities. </p>

<p>Another contribution of the Council might be to help subsidize
the evaluation of drug films, literature, and curricula offered
to the schools. It might also design or commission methods of
evaluation by which school programs would be able to assess their
own results. </p>

<p>Perhaps the most critical problem of most school
drug-education programs is their passivity. The Council might
support and disseminate information about some less traditional
approaches, such as active engagement using drugs in behavior
experiments with animals, discussion of nondrug inducement of
altered states of consciousness, or extended discussions of
values and what youngsters hope to get out of drugs. These
represent a few of the more promising (but scarce) approaches we
have encountered. </p>

<p>The attraction of television for the young child makes it a
logical educational device on drugs. Consideration should be
given to working with a group skilled in educational motivational
techniques, such as Children's Television Workshop, on films for
use in elementary school or over national television. </p>

<p>General Public Information. Perhaps the single most important
service of the Council would be to act as an independent source
of relevant information for the public about drug-abuse problems.
There is a need for a new and wholly independent perspective on
such fundamental issues as the nature and scope of the drug
problem, the effects of present law-enforcement policies at all
levels, the real dangers of youthful marijuana use, the treatment
or recovery potential of different kinds of drug abusers, how
much crime can really be accounted for by drug abusers, how the
English system of heroin maintenance works and with what results,
the federal government's activity in terms of dollars, and the
allocation of those dollars among enforcement, treatment,
research, and education, the foreign experience with marijuana
users, and how a school-or a parent-should best react to the
presence of drugs. </p>

<p>These are the issues that are troubling Americans. Two New
York State public-opinion surveys showed that drug use was
considered a major neighborhood problem by 23 per cent of those
interviewed, surpassed only by burglary, vandalism, and unsafe
streets. A New York Times survey of 463 New York voters, reported
on October 4, 1970, placed drugs as the fourth most prominent
problem facing the nation and the foremost problem facing the
voter's immediate community. At present, the public receives its
information on these matters primarily from government sources. </p>

<p>Many methods must be used to inform the public of key
developments in the field and explore key policy issues in drug
abuse control. The Council could commission its own public
opinion surveys on key issues to guide the direction of its
information efforts. State-of-the-art papers might be published,
containing accurate but readable technical material on the nature
and effects of drugs. Accounts of comparative experiences of
different jurisdictions with varying law-enforcement, treatment,
and education approaches could be prepared and disseminated. </p>

<p>Whether such material is widely read will depend in large part
on its readability and press coverage. The Council will need a
good editor, with a sound basic understanding of the sciences and
able to write simply but accurately. It will also need a library
capacity to collect and analyze information of all kinds; it may
in time want to become a national information center, publishing
attractively packaged periodicals for the lay audience containing
such analyses. It may use radio and TV for forums in which
outstanding experts in the field can discuss key concepts and
thus dispel some of the myths that abound. Different media, of
course, would be targeted to different audiences-parents, youths,
inner-city residents, and the suburban middle class. </p>

<p>Consultative Services for Key Officials and Organizations. The
Council might wish to provide counseling services on a selective
basis for key figures and organizations in the drug-abuse field,
such as major professional organizations and leagues of city or
state officials. Such persons might wish to utilize the expertise
of Council staff in many areas before undertaking major policy
commitments or advising their members. Meetings and symposia
could be designed by the Council staff to facilitate
communication between key professionals and policy-making
officials and to disseminate its own findings. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>LAW-ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS</b> </p>

<p>Basic law enforcement is, of course, a federal, state, and
local governmental function, and we would recommend that the
Council not enter this field in any substantial way. </p>

<p>Although the federal government is now engaged in
international negotiations to reduce the supply of opium and its
foreign manufacture into heroin, as well as to increase border
surveillance to reduce its importation, we cannot be optimistic
about their efforts. Previous attempts by the United States to
stop foreign cultivation and manufacture have proved
frustratingly unsuccessful, and the number of world sources of
opium and the ease with which foreign production quotas can be
circumvented give no cause for belief that future efforts will be
any more successful. There is also a widely held belief among
experts in the drug field that, if any one drug of abuse were
eliminated, a new one would almost certainly be available to
displace it. Thus, even assuming that all heroin and marijuana
were stopped at the border, marijuana could be grown in this
country, synthetic hallucinogens (probably more toxic) could
readily displace marijuana, and synthetic opiates and other drugs
could readily be available for use in place of heroin. Although
better border control or reduction of supply might tighten the
market somewhat, thus forcing the price up, it seems unlikely
that it would have a substantial long-range impact on the
underlying causes and effects of drug abuse, or even on its
prevalence. In sum, this appears to be an area of limited
potential, wishful thinking to the contrary, and one in which the
federal government is already investing heavily. </p>

<p>We do recommend, however, that some exploration be made into
the reasons that law-enforcement officials at present seem unable
to prosecute more of the high-volume drug pushers once the drugs
get into the country, even though they profess to know who the
pushers are, where they engage in their operations, and a great
deal of other information about them. Prosecution of important
nonaddict drug pushers can have a temporary effect on total drug
availability at the street level and force some addicts into
treatment. It would, in addition, have a substantial
psychological effect in many ghetto communities, where it is
often thought that the police purposely do not prosecute drug
pushers because they have made deals with the illicit trader or
because they wish minority groups to remain enslaved to drugs. We
believe that exerting pressure on the commercial sellers of
illegal drugs is a desirable objective and should be done in the
most efficient way possible. For that reason, we recommend the
exploration with federal and local authorities of ways to
increase arrests at the top levels of the drug traffic. If the
Council enters this area at all, it should work closely with the
staff of the Police Foundation to encourage innovative strategies
by state or local police departments. The active utilization of
antidrug community groups to help in policing and exerting formal
sanctions in their own neighborhoods against pushers is one area
of potential. </p>

<p>The Council might also want to study the effect of various
laws and law-enforcement policies on the actual use of drugs and
the treatment of drug abusers. This area is badly in need of
careful study. The results of such a study might then become the
subject of a &quot;white paper&quot; by the Council for
consideration by local officials, budgetmakers, and the public at
large. It might also help to create a more open climate for
experimentation in different control strategies. The current push
from the federal government is for all the states to commit
themselves legislatively to a single model of law enforcement. It
would seem, however, that states should be as laboratories to try
out different approaches and to evaluate the results stemming
from those variations. </p>

<p>There also appears to be a real need for educational programs
specifically aimed at law-enforcement and court personnel, who
will probably continue to be the largest intake process for
illegal drug users. Although BNDD runs a law-enforcement training
program for state and local police officers with respect to
narcotics laws, it does not appear to emphasize the medical and
social aspects of drug abuse, its causes and effects, the
community resources that can be utilized in combating it from a
public-health and social standpoint rather than from a law
enforcement standpoint, the importance of not ruining the lives
of young children as a result of unfortunate experimentation with
drug abuse, and similar aspects of this problem. The Council
might fruitfully direct its efforts to helping police and court
personnel, both juvenile and adults, to develop informal
mechanisms for rapidly screening and diverting serious drug users
into treatment programs in lieu of legal processing. Conferences
might be sponsored for law-enforcement and judicial personnel to
focus on the best of these diversion programs. An effective
juvenile court treatment project along these lines is, in our
opinion, one of the greatest unmet needs in the entire field. </p>

<p>Finally, many improvements in the present law-enforcement
approach toward drug abuse may have to come from the courts.
There will be increasing attacks upon the irrationality of
present drug laws, centering upon the right to privacy involved
in the personal use of drugs, and the extension of the ruling in
Robinson v. California that a person may not be criminally
punished for addiction to include possession, use, and presence
in illegal establishments or association with other addicts. The
question of the right to treatment for an addict can be expected
to be raised not only in civil commitment programs, where
treatment is minimal, but also in communities without methadone
programs, or where methadone dispensation is severely restricted
by law, or even ultimately where doctors are not allowed to
prescribe it for addict patients. </p>

<p>In the juvenile field, a long-standing and perhaps legally
vulnerable impediment to treatment is the legal requirement for
paternal permission. Addicts can also be expected to raise their
eligibility for welfare as &quot;disabled persons&quot; or as
&quot;medically needy&quot; under Medicaid laws. Treatment
programs all over the country have encountered difficulties in
locating facilities in highaddiction areas because of outmoded
zoning laws. The right of &quot;gatekeepers,&quot; such as
teachers and nurses, to withhold from law-enforcement authorities
confidential information received from students may have to be
tested in the courts. Limitations of treatment programs to
selected kinds of addicts will probably also be legally attacked.
The adjustment of our now-primitive body of drug-abuse laws to
new medical developments in research and treatment may well have
to come about through a series of court cases as well as, and
even in the absence of, legislative changes. The Council staff
should keep abreast of such legal developments and, where
appropriate, lend financial assistance to legal groups seeking
such adjustments. The D.C. Lawyers Committee project on training
a corps of addict specialists and the comments filed on the
methadone regulations by the Center for Law and Social Policy are
examples of such worthy efforts. </p>

<p><b>THE LEADERSHIP ROLE<br>
</b></p>

<p>We have suggested that the most critical reason for
establishing a Drug Abuse Council is to create independent
leadership in the field. That leadership must inevitably be
earned through professional and public credibility, and through
excellence of staff and product. The Council must lead in
formulating and disseminating sound ways of thinking and acting
toward drug use. It must, in short, become a center for policy
study in the drug field, to which researchers, legislators,
educators, policy-making officials, and the lay public will turn
for nonpartisan analysis and information. </p>

<p>This role can be accomplished primarily by using the best
thinkers in many different fields to find out what is actually
happening to drug users-not just the young experimenters or
mainliners, but the older pill-takers as well-why they are taking
drugs, and what other ways can be found to satisfy their
underlying urges and needs. The &quot;drug-abuse problem&quot;
needs to be perceived in a less rigid and emotional way by the
public at large. The nation has to understand how our present
system of drug controls really operates, and with what
consequences to what people. It must be given a realistic notion,
rather than palliatives, of what we can expect to accomplish
through education, treatment, and law enforcement, and what part
of the problem must be approached in even more complex and subtle
ways. </p>

<p>At the same time, there must be a sense of urgency about the
Council's work. As soon as it is organized, the Council must
consider such matters of immediate importance as </p>

<p>The work of the Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse
established under the 1970 federal drug-abuse law </p>

<p>The authority of the Secretary of HEW to authorize researchers
to protect the privacy of research subjects under the 1970
federal law </p>

<p>The obligation of the Secretary of HEW under the 1970 federal
law to report to Congress on the proper methods of medical
treatment of narcotic addiction </p>

<p>The authority of the Department of justice to establish quotas
for drugs, like heroin, that have no accepted medical use but are
needed for research purposes </p>

<p>The proposed new International Protocol on Psychotropic
Substances being considered by the U.N. Commission on Narcotic
Drugs </p>

<p>Implementation of the proposed new methadone regulations The
proposals to conform state law to the 1970 federal law and the
proposed new Uniform State Act </p>

<p>The proposed new federal Rules of Evidence that affect the
confidentiality of the doctor-patient relationship </p>

<p>Of equal importance, priorities must be established with
respect to the broad work of the Council and work begun on its
long range objectives. The projects that should be given prompt .

        the value of different types and degrees of success </li>
    <li>A review of the experiences of secondary schools with
        handling drugs-including the use of confidentiality

    <li>A study of the employment of ex-addicts in treatment-the
        kinds of jobs available, the legal and community

        a few major jurisdictions-how it is enforced, against
        whom, the penalties given out, and what happens to the
        classification sections </li>
    <li>Compare the experience in states with high (e.g.,
        Missouri) and low (e.g., Nebraska) marijuana penalties to

    <li>An analysis of the difficulties facing law-enforcement
        officials in the enforcement of drug laws against
        wholesale and retail traffickers </li>
</ul>

<p>It is not possible to lay down a step-by-step program for
changing the present climate surrounding drug abuse in the
country. How to get the country to focus on the real evils of
drug abuse and to attack them rationally without contributing to
the creation of even greater ones is a monumental task.
Hopefully, the Council will not be alone in working toward such
an end and will be able to enlist the support of state and city
governments, such branches of the federal government as NIMH, and
other private and professional organizations. Hopefully, too,
much of its work will affect the related problem of alcoholism
and will help to end the fragmented approach toward different
kinds of drug-taking. The pace of the work and the priorities
must obviously be decided by the Council board and staff itself,
guided by a realistic notion of the magnitude of the tasks facing
them and the opportunity to do something constructive about them.
</p>

<p><b>CONCLUSION</b> </p>

<p>It is of fundamental importance that man has and. will
inevitably continue to have potentially dangerous drugs at his
disposal, which he may either use properly or abuse, and that
neither the availability of these drugs nor the temptation to
abuse them can be eliminated. Therefore, the fundamental
objective of a modern drug-abuse program must be to help the
public learn to understand these drugs and how to cope with their
use in the context of everyday life. An approach emphasizing
suppression of all drugs or repression of all drug users will
only contribute to national problems. </p>

<p>There is an urgent need for effective nongovernmental
leadership toward a more reasoned approach to drug abuse in this
country. A void exists that we believe can be filled by the
creation of a new Drug Abuse Council. In our best judgment, the
Council could successfully exert this leadership and could have a
substantial and beneficial impact on drug abuse in this country. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>NOTES</b> </p>

<p>1. Evidence obtained during 1971 indicates that the number of
active heroin addicts as of December, 1971, was probably between
250,000 and 300,000. 2. The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention
and Control Act of 1970 reduced these penalties to imprisonment
for up to one year for a first offense and two years for each
subsequent offense. </p>

<p>3. The 1970 Act established a Commission on Marijuana and Drug
Abuse to review existing laws and policy and recommend necessary
legislation and administrative action. </p>

<p>4. See Staff Paper 5 for the most recent figures. </p>

<p>5. This information has become available and is presented in
Staff Paper 5. </p>

<p>6. In 1971 this organization changed its name to the National
Coordinating Council on Drug Use Education. </p>

<p>7. By December, 1971, there were over 300 methadone projects
and a large number of persons receiving methadone by prescription
outside of these projects. An estimated 50,000 patients are now
using this drug for maintenance. See Staff Paper 3. </p>

<p>8. In November, 1971, the Food and Drug Administration
announced it intention to propose broader approval of methadone
under a closely con trolled distribution system. </p>

<p>9. These estimates are based on an addict population of about
100,000 During 1971, official estimates of the number of addicts
were raised. It i now estimated that 100,000 to 120,000 pounds of
opium are needed annually to supply the U.S. market. </p>

<p>10. In June, 1971, the President proposed a Special Action
Office for Drug Abuse Prevention to coordinate federal drug-abuse
efforts in treatment, education, and research. Regulation and law
enforcement, and military and veterans' problems are not
included.<br>

<p>A Primer on Psychopharmacology </p>

<p>Drugs of Abuse<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>A PRIMER ON PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY <br>
</b></p>

<p>Psychopharmacology, as the term is used here, refers to the
study of the interactions of drugs with the central nervous
system (CNS), including physical, behavioral, and subjective
effects. The term is not always used so broadly; we have chosen a
comprehensive definition because this brief paper is neither
detailed enough nor sophisticated enough to require the fine
divisions implied by more exact categorization into such
subspecialties as neurophysiology, neurochemistry,
neuropharmacology, psychopharmacology, neuropsychology, and so
forth. </p>

<p>As will become obvious, there are many areas in which basic
knowledge about the mechanisms of action of psychoactive drugs
does not exist. Our purpose here is to describe for laymen the
framework within which such knowledge must be sought, and the
difficulties involved.*<br>
</p>

<p>* Since this paper was written by a layman for laymen,
technical terms and discussion have been avoided as much as
possible. In most cases where extended discussion would have to
be highly technical, the conclusions of experts on the present
state of knowledge are set forth with a citation to the
discussion leading to these conclusions. Drs. Avram Goldstein,
Norman Zinberg, Andrew Weil, Frederick DiCarlo, and Alan Green
all read earlier drafts of this paper. They prevented some
embarrassing errors, but they are not to blame for any that
remain.<br>
</p>

<p><b>THE NERVOUS SYSTEM I<br>
</b></p>

<p>The nervous system is composed of millions of nerve cells
(neurons) that are by no means homogeneous in structure. Some are
very long, even up to several feet; some are bushy, with -many
fibers reaching out to connect with other nerves; some are small
and simple. The cells do not interlock with each other at the
ends, where the impulse is transmitted from one to another. There
are, instead, microscopic gaps, called synapses, between them,
which must be bridged by the impulse. </p>

<p>There are several ways to categorize the parts of the nervous
system, each useful for different purposes. One division is
between the CNS-the brain and spinal cord-and the peripheral
nervous system, which is everything else. The peripheral system
is composed of nerve fibers extending out from cell bodies
contained within the CNS and, to some extent, of cell bodies
clumped outside of it but, of course, still connected. While the
peripheral system has groups of fibers (nerves) and groups of
cell bodies (ganglia), it is simple compared to the CNS, which
consists of millions of tightly packed neurons, fiber groups
(tracts), and clumps of cell bodies (nuclei) with billions of
synapses. </p>

<p>The psychoactive component of the effect of drugs is due to
their effects on the CNS rather than on the peripheral system,
and it is the CNS with which we are concerned. The peripheral
system is relevant only insofar as research into the mechanisms
of peripheral action casts light on the workings of the CNS. </p>

<p>Another way of dividing the nervous system is by function. The
somatic system includes both the central and the peripheral
neurons that convey impulses from the sense organs, organize them
in the brain, and deliver motor impulses to the skeletal muscles.
The autonomic system governs the smooth muscles of the
intestines, urogenital tract, and blood vessels; the heart
muscles; and the endocrine glands. In short, the somatic system
controls the body's response to the external environment; the
autonomic system governs the internal environment. </p>

<p>The autonomic system is further subdivided into two parts. The
sympathetic system generally mobilizes bodily resources for
action-it constricts visceral blood vessels so that more blood is
directed to muscles and brain, accelerates the heart beat,
inhibits intestinal and gastric activity, widens the pupils of
the eye, and secretes adrenaline The parasympathetic system is
the antagonist of these effects. It acts to conserve bodily
resources, usually by having effects that are the reverse of
those of the sympathetic system. The parasympathetic system is
more specific than the sympathetic, however. While the latter
tends to act diffusely, causing all the effects at once, the
parasympathetic system can act independently on different organs.
</p>

<p>The differentiation between autonomic and somatic systems is
clearest at the periphery of the nervous system. As one traces
the systems toward the CNS, the distinction becomes more vague.
In the main trunks of peripheral nerves, for example, the fibers
of the different systems are bound together and can be separated
only by tracing them to their terminations or on the basis of
some differences in fiber types. Within the CNS centers, division
of functions is always a matter of degree rather than of complete
specialization. While some centers are concerned primarily with
somatic or with autonomic functions, the two are always closely
coordinated, and the separation is not complete. </p>

<p>The CNS itself is not, of course, a random melange of
heterogeneous neurons. There are many different and identifiable
parts to it-medulla, pons, cerebellum, midbrain, reticular
formation, thalamus, optic tract, cerebral hemispheres, basal
ganglia, and so forth. For some of these, the functions are
fairly well established; for others, they are not. To try to
describe these would be far beyond the scope of this appendix.
For our purposes, it is enough to state the following
propositions: </p>

<ul>
    <li>There is much specialization within the CNS, in that a
        particular part will have a specific and identifiable
        function. (For example, the thalamus is a relay station,
        with impulses arriving from lower centers and being
        passed on to higher ones; the hypothalamus has the
        primary control over autonomic functions; the cerebral
        cortex contains the more complex psychological functions;
        and so on.) </li>
    <li>Each part consists of packed nerve cells with many
        connections to each other and to different parts of the
        brain. </li>
    <li>Many, if not all, functions involve more than one CNS
        center. </li>
    <li>It is easier to study motor or sensory functions, where
        CNS activity can be correlated with an output, than to
        study pure cognitive functions, where it cannot. <br>
    </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><b>PROBLEMS IN STUDYING THE CNS <br>
</b></p>

<p>The study of the CNS is extraordinarily difficult. As Kenneth
Moore states, &quot;The human brain contains a complex of
millions of nerve cells that are anatomically independent but
functionally interconnected. An impulse starting in one neuron
can propagate throughout the nervous system over a variety of
pathways. The route taken is determined by the inborn
organization of the brain and by ongoing events that, because of
neural plasticity, can establish new circuits.&quot;' Obviously,
the number of permutations possible in such a system would make
study difficult, even if no other problems existed. Moore,
however, goes on to list some of the major impediments to
research on the CNS: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Many ideas about neural functioning derive from study of
        the peripheral system, where most synapses are well
        defined in that only one synapse exists at a particular
        point. In the CNS, the cell bodies are covered with
        synapses. They are also closely packed among other cells
        (the glia), which may perform some neural functions even
        though they are not neurons. </li>
    <li>In each peripheral synapse only one chemical transmitter
        is thought to act. Each CNS nerve cell may be affected by
        several different transmitters. [Transmitters are
        discussed on pp.67-68.] </li>
    <li>Neural reactions occur in milliseconds and are hard to
        find and measure. </li>
    <li>The biochemical processes involved in peripheral systems
        can be studied in test tubes (in vitro) where tissue
        slices can be made to react. This is not true for studies
        of the brain, because brain neurons in vitro are in a
        resting state, disconnected from the other neurons that
        ordinarily determine their activities. While artificial
        stimulation can be applied, there is no way of knowing
        whether this corresponds to actions in the body. In
        particular, it is difficult to relate any in vitro
        reactions to such higher functions as thought or emotion.
    </li>
    <li>Because the different units of the CNS have different
        functions and anatomies, the biochemical reactions of any
        particular part are probably not the same as those of any
        other part. </li>
    <li>There is a unique blood-brain barrier between the blood
        and the brain that makes chemical manipulation of the CNS
        via injection into the bloodstream more difficult than is
        manipulation of other tissues. [The capillaries in the
        brain are somewhat less permeable than the capillaries
        elsewhere in the body.] </li>
    <li>The synapses are so densely packed that chemical
        manipulation by administration directly to the brain is
        much more difficult. </li>
    <li>Some brain structures are not accessible in a live
        subject because they are surrounded by other structures.
        If it is not useful to study them in vitro, and one
        cannot study them in situ, it is rather difficult to
        study them at all. </li>
    <li>When experiments are carried out in a live subject it is
        often necessary to stop a chemical reaction quickly so as
        to preserve the tissue at a particular point in the
        process. This is usually done by rapid excision and
        immersion in a low-temperature liquid. Since the entire
        CNS is surrounded by bone, it is difficult to perform
        this operation quickly enough. Some chemicals present in
        vivo may never be identified because they are destroyed
        too quickly.'<br>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>This represents a formidable list of difficulties. And, since
psychoactive drugs are usually fairly specific to the CNS-in that
they affect the CNS without having much effect on other body
systems-it is easy to see why knowledge of their sites and
mechanisms of action is less than complete, despite intensive
study during the past several decades. <br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>THEORIES OF PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS <br>
</b></p>

<p>The present theory about the manner in which psychoactive
drugs operate is that they affect the transmission of the nerve
impulses across the synapses. This hypothesis is based upon more
general theories concerning the chemical nature of this
transmission. Researchers know that in a peripheral system
certain chemical substances (acetylcholine in the somatic system
and norepinephrine in the autonomic) are associated with the
stimulation of nerve impulses. These substances can also be found
in the CNS and appear to be correlated with activity levels
there. </p>

<p>Because nerve impulses are thought to be electrical in nature,
the theory of their effect is as follows: A nerve impulse that
reaches the synapse of a particular neuron stimulates the release
of a particular transmitter substance. This substance affects the
receptors of the adjoining nerve cell (the postsynaptic neuron),
changes its electrical potential, and triggers an impulse within
it. Most of the transmitter substance is taken back into the
neuron from which it came, although some of it is destroyed by
enzymes or diffused by the blood. The postsynaptic nerve then
returns to its original state. </p>

<p>Psychoactive drugs may affect this sequence by stimulating or
inhibiting the production of the transmitter substance, by
causing its release from storage, by affecting the process by
which it is taken back into the neuron, or by stimulating or
inhibiting its destruction. These processes have an effect on the
level and type of activity in the CNS and a consequent effect on
the perceptions and activities of the body. </p>

<p>Beyond this, it is difficult to say anything with much
certainty. Some psychoactive drugs are associated with increased
CNS levels of particular substances that are thought to be
transmitters, but the causation is not firmly established.
Mandell and Spooner have pointed out that the evidence for
transmitter theory is in many ways startlingly indirect.' Their
final comment is: &quot;Even on a neurochernical level, we must
talk about empirical correlates of behavioral states. Rigorous
establishment of the transmitter or modulator role of brain
substances appears to remain for the future.&quot; </p>

<p>The strongest evidence that a particular substance has
transmitter functions concerns acetlycholine Wh). Neurons
sensitive to this substance are distributed throughout the brain,
so that it can have excitatory or inhibiting functions, depending
on the region. ACh is difficult to study, because it does not
pass the blood-brain barrier easily and is destroyed rapidly
after artificial administration. Its effects on certain cells in
the spinal cord have been studied, but not much is known about
effects at other synapses in the CNS. There is also fairly good
evidence that two catecholamines-norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine
(D)-perform transmitter functions. Again, however, much of what
is thought about their action is derived from research with the
peripheral system, and conclusions must be approached warily. NE
and D, together with their degrading enzymes, are also located in
various regions of the brain.-' </p>

<p>Some researchers believe that 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-11T),
often called serotonin, is also a transmitter, but the evidence
is not as strong as for the substances already discussed. As
Moore states, &quot;Despite years of active investigation, the
functional significance of this amine remains obscure.&quot;' The
substance may excite, depress, or have no effect on neurons, but
the reasons for the differences are not known. It has no
functions in the peripheral system and is thus even more
difficult to study than the other possibilities. </p>

<p>A number of other substances may be transmitters, but the
evidence is ambiguous. For example, the brain contains a
relatively high concentration of free amino acids, some of which
may have transmitter functions. And there are a number of other
possibilities, such as histamine, substance P, Prostaglandins,
and ergothioneine. <br>

<p><b>MECHANISMS OF DRUG ACTION<br>
</b></p>

<p>Even if the transmitter theory were certain and a connection
between transmitters and psychoactive drugs proved, there would
be the problem of understanding the mechanisms by which the drugs
affect the transmitters. This problem relates to the more general
pharmacological question of the manner in which drugs affect
cells and to the basic pharmacological concept of receptor sites:
</p>

<p>. . . most drugs are thought to produce their effects by
combining with enzymes, cell membranes, or other specialized
functional components of cells. Drug-cell interaction is presumed
to alter the function of the cell component and thereby initiate
the series of biochemical and physiological changes that are
characteristic of the drug.... </p>

<p>The cell component directly involved in the initial action of
the drug is usually termed ... its receptor., </p>

<p>In its simplest form, the receptor-site theory is that, at the
basic site of action of any drug, there are cells or cell
surfaces that form molecular bonds with the drug molecules.
Current theory is that these sites are stereospecific-it is not
only the chemical composition of the drug that determines whether
the receptor can bond with it but its three-dimensional geometric
shape as well. A cell surface might have, for example, three or
four different points of contact where different molecular bonds
could be formed. A drug molecule must have a geometric shape that
allows proper subgroups of the molecule to come in contact with
these points for the formation of a firm bond. </p>

<p>This theory of stereospecificity explains why drugs that are
diverse in chemical structure may have similar effects (e.g.,
morphine, methadone, and meperidine). Even though chemical
structures are different, geometric structures can be similar. In
contrast, variations of the same substance with similar chemical
structures but different geometric structures may not have
similar effects.' </p>

<p>The classic assumptions of receptor-site theory are: (1) One
molecule of drug combines with one receptor site, (2) a
negligible fraction of the total drug is combined, and (3) the
response of the body to the drug is directly related to the
proportion of available receptor sites that are occupied. </p>

<p>The interaction between drugs and cells is governed by the law
of mass action. The molecules of a drug are constantly
associating with and dissociating from receptor sites. At some
point, for any given drug concentration, an equilibrium is
reached where association and dissociation balance. The
drug-receptor interaction, therefore, is dynamic, not static.
Since most drug-toreceptor bonds are thought to be relatively
weak ionic bonds that are readily reversible, this concept of
dynamic interaction becomes important in understanding the
process of antagonistic effects, blockade, and reversibility of
drug action. All are based on theories about differences in the
strength of bonds formed by different drugs and on competition
for receptor sites. </p>

<p>Since these basic assumptions do not, however, explain all the
observed phenomena of drug action in many cases, including the
action of narcotic analgesics, various departures from the basic
occupancy assumption have been suggested. The most important are
(1) that not only occupation of the receptor sites matters but
also the intrinsic &quot;efficacy&quot; of the drug; (2) that it
is not the occupancy of the site that matters but the act of
occupying, and that drug effect depends on the relative rates of
association and dissociation, and (3) that there are spare
receptors that may be occupied, although at a lower level of
efficiency, when the primary receptors are already occupied.
These explain some of the otherwise unexplained phenomena, but
they leave other, different mysteries of their own.' Nor are
these questions likely to be settled soon. </p>

<p>There are two ways to gain information about a receptor. The
first and only really satisfactory approach is to identify and
isolate it. Then the investigation can follow established
biochemical and physicochemical procedures. Sequence analysis can
establish the primary structure of the macromolecules. Techniques
like x-ray crystallography, high-resolution electron micrography,
spectrophotometry, and analytical ultracentrifugation can yield
data from which the secondary and tertiary structure may be
deduced. </p>

<p>In the case of proteins, recent years have seen the
elucidation of complete primary structures at an ever-increasing
rate.... </p>

<p>The second way of obtaining information about receptors is
indirect. It has dominated pharmacologic research in the past.
The approach is to draw inferences about a receptor from the
biologic end results caused by drugs. A powerful tool employed
toward this end has been the study of structure-activity
relationships (abbreviated SAR). A suitable biologic effect of a
drug is chosen for study. A prototype drug, which elicits the
characteristic effect, is then modified systematically in its
molecular structure. Substituents are added or subtracted at
various positions and in different steric configurations. A
series of such chemically related drugs is known as congeneric
series. By testing the members of a series and observing how
biologic potency is affected by each molecular modification, one
may ultimately draw conclusions about the precise mode of
combination of a drug with its receptor surface.10 </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the study of psychoactive drugs belongs in the
second category. No one has found the receptor sites or knows
which cells might be involved. Concerning narcotic analgesics,
Goldstein says, &quot;It must be remembered . . . that the
receptor, whose structural features are inferred from the SAR
studies . . . is entirely hypothetical.&quot;11 </p>

<p>Finally, theories of action at the receptor site say nothing
about the biochemical events in the CNS that constitute the
eventual product of the interaction of the drug and the receptor
site. &quot;Investigations of the mechanism of tolerance and of
the mechanism of narcotic action have been hampered by the same
difficulty-that the biochemical alterations produced by the drug
in the whole brain are unlikely to have much to do with the
specific biochemical changes that are responsible for the drug
effects at the sites of drug action.&quot;12 </p>

<p>Jaffe makes a similar point. After reviewing the various
theories and experiments on the effect of opiates on cerebral
neural action, cerebral metabolism, and neurotransmitters, he
says: </p>

<p>... Unfortunately, knowledge of the functional role of the
several postulated neurobumoral transmitter agents in the CNS is
still so limited and controversial that the demonstration of an
effect of morphine on them has not yet contributed significantly
to an understanding of either the neurophysiological and
behavioral effects of the drug or its mechanism of action .13<br>

<p><font size="5"><b>DRUGS OF ABUSE <br>
</b></font></p>

<p><b>OPIATES</b> </p>

<p>The Drugs.&quot; Opium is a natural substance derived from one
variety of the poppy plant. It contains over twenty different
alkaloids with varying properties, constituting 25 per cent of
opium by weight. A few of these-primarily morphine and codeine
are medically useful. </p>

<p>In discussing opiate abuse, the specific drugs of concern are
the following: </p>

<p><i>Morphine </i>is a natural alkaloid constituting 10 per cent
by weight of the raw opium. </p>

<p><i>Heroin. </i>Because heroin is produced by chemical
treatment of morphine with acetic acid, the technical name for it
is diacetylmorphine. In terms of analgesic effect, heroin is a
little over three times as potent as morphine-for example, it
takes three milligrams of heroin to produce the same analgesic
effect as 10 milligrams of morphine. </p>

<p>Although heroin is the principal opiate of abuse in the United
States, most research has been done with the more readily
available morphine. In the opinion of experts, such research is
applicable to heroin if the dosage difference is considered,
because heroin rapidly breaks down into morphine in the body.
Thus, its subsequent pharmacological action is the same. </p>

<p><i>Methadone </i>is a synthetic opiate of approximately the
same strength as morphine. </p>

<p><i>Meperidine </i>is another synthetic opiate that is about 10
to 20 per cent as potent as morphine. It is better known under
its trade name, Demerol. </p>

<p>While all four drugs are analgesic, euphorigenic, and in many
ways fungible, there are some differences among them,
particularly in maximal effect and duration of action. Throughout
this paper, morphine is the primary subject. Important
differences in the characteristics of the other opiates are
discussed where relevant. </p>

<p>Because of lack of information, two topics are not discussed.
First, it should not be assumed that the effects and
characteristics of raw opium are the same as those of morphine.
It has been suggested that the mixture of many different
alkaloids in opium may have substantially modifying effects on
the action of any individual alkaloid, such as morphine.15 This
is unproved; but-since the medical use of crude opium ended in
the Western world soon after 1850-there are no data either way.
Secondly, it is possible to produce drugs from crude opium that
are stronger than morphine. For example, some derivatives of
thebaine, a nonanalgesic opium alkaloid, may be one thousand
times more potent.16 The effects of such superpotent opiates have
not been studied and might differ qualitatively from those of
morphine. </p>

<p><i>Medical Uses. </i>In the late nineteenth century, opium and
morphine were sometimes referred to by physicians as
&quot;GOM,&quot; &quot;God's Own Medicine.&quot; They were used
for asthma, dysentery, alcoholism, and a wide variety of other
diseases-including the simple cough.&quot; In fact, the opiates
are effective cough suppressants, constipants, and tranquilizers,
and, in an era lacking other drugs, their heavy use was natural. </p>

<p>Today, however, since there are drugs without the addictive
potential of opiates that are equally, or nearly as, effective
for most of these purposes, the medical use of opiates has become
less common. Yet, the opiates are still the most effective
pain-killing drugs known to medicine, and large quantities of
morphine and meperidine are used as such every year. Although
there is a continuing search for equally effective nonaddictive
pain relievers, none has been found, and it may be that none will
be. For a time, some of the narcotic antagonists were believed to
have the desired properties; more recently, pentazocine was
thought promising. But the latest evidence indicates that the
analgesic qualities of these drugs are due to properties that
also cause addiction. </p>

<p><i>Physical Effects and Toxicity. </i>The exact method by
which morphine blocks pain is unclear. It does not appear to
block the transmission of the pain impulse through the nerves (as
do local anesthetics), because sensation and feeling are not
affected. For example, someone heavily dosed with morphine will
still be able to feel a touch or other relatively slight
sensations. In addition, experiments have shown that a patient,
even after being given morphine as a pain reliever, can
accurately determine the amount of pain he would be suffering
without the drug. What seems to change is the relationship of the
subject to the pain. Although he feels the pain and can tell how
great it would be without the drug, he is not
&quot;bothered&quot; by it. For these reasons, it is thought that
the drug acts in the part of the brain that interprets the nerve
message.&quot; </p>

<p>For a nontolerant individual, morphine is highly toxic. A dose
of 100 to 200 mg. would be sufficient to cause a fatal
respiratory depression. This, like the analgesic effect, is a
consequence of the effects of the drug on the CNS rather than on
other parts of the nervous system-morphine reduces the
responsiveness of brainstem respiratory centers to concentrations
of carbon dioxide.&quot; </p>

<p>Tolerance to the respiratory effect increases rapidly, and no
researcher has yet found an absolute limit to the quantity of
morphine that can be taken by a tolerant individual without
causing death. Some persons have been known to take as much as
four grams of morphine without adverse effect.&quot; </p>

<p>No one has discovered long-term organic damage caused by
morphine. In autopsy, neither gross nor microscopic examination
of tissues shows evidence of such effects.&quot; Various studies
have followed the medical history of addicts over a substantial
period of time, and, according to one of the studies, &quot;while
there is ample evidence that the aberrant way of life followed by
most heroin abusers has both acute and chronic medical
consequences . . . there is insufficient scientific basis for
maintaining that long-term use of opiates-in and of itself-is
related to any major medical condition.&quot;&quot; </p>

<p>Addicts do, however, suffer from a variety of conditions
ancillary to their general life-style and frequently die of viral
hepatitis, bacterial infections, or other diseases. The death
rate of the addict population is not known, but it is usually
estimated as about 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent per year.&quot;
Malaria used to be common among addicts, until dope sellers began
using quinine to cut heroin. Other deaths are often attributed to
an overdose of heroin sufficient to cause respiratory depression.
The possibility of an overdose is always present, because the
quality of street heroin so varies that an addict may not know
how much pure heroin he is getting in any purchase or even how
much he is used to taking. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, several experts have stated that overdose and
disease do not explain all addict deaths.&quot; In many cases,
the dead addict did not receive more heroin than he was used to
or should have been able to take, given his pre-existing level of
tolerance. It is possible that some people have a special
sensitivity to heroin that takes the form of an idiosyncratic
response to a single dose or that is analogous to an allergic
reaction triggered by repeated use. However, there are no reports
in medical annals of persons having this reaction after receiving
morphine in a medical setting. Since morphine is used extensively
in medicine, it would be expected that such a serious effect
would have been observed by this time. But there are also some
reports of an unusually high death rate in England, where addicts
receive pure heroin. The English data on this are incomplete,
however, and the causative factors have not been adequately
analyzed. </p>

<p>Morphine does cause some physical effects, of uncertain
significance. There are changes in excretion of epinephrine and
norepinephrine. Rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep is depressed.
Stabilized addicts become hypochondriacal, apathetic, and bored
with other people and have fitful sleep.&quot; Whether these
responses signify permanent change or damage, however, is not
clear. </p>

<p>In all animal species, including man, morphine has an
excitatory effect as well as an analgesic one. This pattern is
not unique to morphine; it is also true, for example, of
barbiturates and alcohol. The reasons are not well understood.
The effect could be due to be a difference in the speed with
which the drug affects different CNS centers, with certain
inhibiting centers being affected first. Or some CNS centers
excited by the drug may react first, with the response
subsequently suppressed by later-reacting centers. Various animal
species, however, react to morphine in different fashions. The
predominant effects in monkeys, dogs, rabbits, and rats, as well
as in man, are sedative, while in horses, cats, and mice they are
excitatory. </p>

<p>Man is considerably more sensitive to the effects of morphine
than are most other animals. For example, the effective analgesic
dose for a man is about <b>0.2 </b>mg. of morphine per kilogram
of body weight. In a dog it is at least ten times as high.&quot;
This raises a number of questions about the meaning of animal
experimentsspecifically, about the relative importance of direct
physical (as opposed to psychological or psychoactive)
consequences of taking the drug. </p>

<p>The opiates vary in several ways affecting consumer
preferences, abuse potential, and the ability of an addict to
stabilize his dosage and lead a relatively normal existence. The
major elements of variance are as follows: </p>

<p><i>Peak effect. </i>This is usually calculated as the maximum
analgesic effect that can be obtained from a given dose of the
drug as measured by the ability to relieve pain. Sometimes
euphoric effect is measured directly through the observation of
physical correlates of drug taking or through verbal responses to
tests designed to determine the degree of euphoria. It is
generally assumed, although not indisputably proved, that the
peak of analgesic effect and the peak of euphoric effect are the
same. </p>

<p><i>Duration of action. </i>This is a more diffuse concept,
because it could mean the duration of relief of a given amount of
pain or the duration of the peak effect. Generally, as used in
the sources, it seems to mean the length of time after
administration before the drug user begins to feel withdrawal
symptoms. Sometimes, however, the phrase &quot;duration of
analgesic action&quot; is used. The exact meaning of this term is
not clear, since it would seem to depend on the level of pain to
be relieved. Empirically, it seems to be about the same as the
generally accepted &quot;duration of action&quot; to withdrawal. </p>

<p><i>Method of administration. </i>All opiates can be taken
orally, subcutaneously (by injection under the skin),
intravenously (by injection into the vein), intramuscularly (by
injection into the muscle), or through the nasal passages. The
effects will differ somewhat, depending on the method used. In
addition, the effect of different methods of administration
varies with the drugs. For example, when taken orally, methadone
retains its efficacy more than morphine. </p>

<p><i>Potency and power. </i>The power of a drug is defined by
the upper limit of the absolute effects it can produce. The
potency of a drug relates to the dosage that is necessary to
produce a given effect. Thus, heroin is not more powerful than
morphine, because both can produce the same effects; but it is
more potent, because it produces equivalent effects at lower
doses. Viewed narrowly, potency might seem of little significance
medically, because one could always give more of the less potent
drug. Few drugs, however, are so specific that they have only one
effect, and the differences in potency may not be uniform for all
effects. For example, morphine is an analgesic producing a side
effect of nausea. Heroin is a more potent analgesic, but this
does not mean, necessarily, that it would be more potent in
causing nausea. </p>

<p>As stated above, potency of an opiate is measured in terms of
analgesic effects, and this is thought-and only thought to equal
euphoric effect. But, given the lack of knowledge about the
mechanisms by which opiates work, it is not impossible that the
various drugs affect different CNS centers in various ways, and
that therefore qualitative variations occur in psychoactive
experiences. Also, superpotent opiates, such as the thebaine
derivatives, might have distinct effects that have not shown up
in comparisons of existing drugs. </p>

<p>Although the basic facts about the opiates are not entirely
clear, the following facts are known: &quot; </p>

<p><i>Morphine, </i>taken subcutaneously, has its peak effect in
one half to one hour. Its duration of analgesic action is four to
six hours, and the decline from the peak is rapid. When it is
taken intravenously, the peak effect is reached sooner and is
somewhat greater. Morphine is effective when taken orally, but
the peak effect is much lower-perhaps only 20 per cent to 30 per
cent of the subcutaneous peak. The duration of action of oral
morphine is at least twelve hours and may be as long as
twenty-four. </p>

<p><i>Heroin </i>is generally thought to act about the same as
morphine. Some animal experiments, however, indicate that heroin
crosses the blood-brain barrier more quickly than morphine. If
this is true for humans, its peak would come more rapidly than
the morphine peak. Addicts sometimes cannot distinguish between
heroin and morphine when they are injected subcutaneously; most
are able to do so, however, when the drugs are taken
intravenously. </p>

<p><i>Methadone, </i>taken subcutaneously, has a peak effect in
three hours and a duration of analgesic action of about twelve
hours. When methadone is taken orally, the peak is about 70 per
cent as great and occurs after four hours. Duration of action
after oral administration is around twenty-four hours, and the
decline from the peak is slow. Intravenously injected methadone
peaks almost immediately, and the duration of action is lessened
accordingly. </p>

<p>Subcutaneous <i>meperidine </i>has a duration of analgesic
action of only two to four hours, and the peak is reached in less
than an hour. With oral administration, the peak is about 50 per
cent as high. Intravenous administration lessens the time needed
to reach the peak effect. Addicted medical personnel, who have
ready access to meperidine, tend to prefer that drug to the other
opiates, possibly because of its fast action and relatively high
potency when taken orally. The dosages of the different drugs
required to produce the same peak effect when administered
subcutaneously are: morphine-10 mg.; heroin-3 mg.; methadone-10
mg.; and meperidine-80 to 100 mg. </p>

<p><i>Addiction. </i>Three aspects of opiate use are particularly
important to an understanding of addiction and its consequences:
(1) the nature of the euphoric psychoactive effect; (2) the
development of tolerance to the drugs; and (3) the development of
physical dependence, with physical withdrawal symptoms, when the
drug is removed. </p>

<p><i>Psychoactive Eflects. </i>Opiates cause a mental clouding
characterized by drowsiness, an inability to concentrate,
lethargy, and reduced visual acuity. As was mentioned before,
stabilized addicts may be hypochondriacal, withdrawn, bored with
other people, and less motivated. Opiates, however, do not cause
slurred speech or significant motor incoordination.&quot; In some
persons, they produce a very pleasant euphoria, but this reaction
is not universal. Many people find that dysphoria, consisting of
mild anxiety and fear, results instead and may be accompanied by
such unpleasant effects as nausea and vomiting. Dysphoria is
extremely common at first use, even among those who eventually
become addicted; indeed, to attain euphoric effects at first may
be an atypical response. In some subjects, the initial response
is a desire to engage in increased activity.&quot; </p>

<p>Goldstein states: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It is well known . . . that most people react with extreme
    displeasure to an initial dose of an opiate narcotic, both
    nausea and dysphoria being common responses. It was once
    supposed that administration of opiates in legitimate medical
    practice might &quot;create&quot; addicts. There is no valid
    evidence of this claim, although it is true that the
    incidence of addiction is high in the health professions,
    where there is easy access to addicting drugs. It is quite
    obvious, however, that of the many millions of patients who
    receive morphine, an insignificantly small fraction ever seek
    to take the drug again. Likewise, in the population as a
    whole, very few of those who could obtain morphine or heroin
    illegally, if they wished, become addicts.30 <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite this, people start taking opiates because they like or
expect to like the effect. It is not known whether those who
become addicts have a different response to the initial use,
experiencing some atypical internal metabolic change, or whether
they simply have more persistence. </p>

<p>For those who find that they have an affinity for the drug,
the euphoric effect is very powerful, although its exact nature
is almost indescribable. This effect can be divided into two
parts. The first part is the &quot;rush&quot;-the initial impact
of the drug on the nervous system. This appears to occur only
when the drug is taken intravenously, and not when it is taken
orally or subcutaneously. Sexual images are frequently used to
describe this effect: &quot;It was like a huge orgasm&quot;;
&quot;It was like coming from every pore.&quot; The second part
is the follow-up sensation of being &quot;high.&quot; Describing
this is more difficult, however, for there is no common
experience from which a pattern can be drawn. Basically, the
effect appears to be that of an emotional analgesic, suppressing
anxiety and care, although the analgesia is not a mere deadening
of emotion. On the contrary, it can be a profoundly heightened
sense of well-being. Whether everyone who persisted in opiate use
would attain this euphoric state, or whether such a state is a
selective reaction based on psychological factors, remains an
unanswered question. There is no model of the addict personality
as such that satisfactorily distinguishes between users and
nonusers; nor is the psychic explanation the only one available.
Some researchers believe that opiate addiction has a
physiological basis, and that the attempt to find psychological
variables is therefore pointless. The varying theories on this
subject are discussed in the last part of this section. </p>

<p><i>Tolerance. </i>A person can become accustomed to a drug's
effects and thus require steadily larger doses to produce a
constant effect. This phenomenon is common with many drugs in
pharmacology, not just drugs of abuse. Tolerance is not the same
as physical dependence and often occurs without it. It is an
important aspect of opiate addiction, because the addict's need
to take steadily larger doses to achieve a euphoric effect
elevates the cost of his habit, causing increased criminal
activity and presumably increasing any long-term toxic effects
that may exist. </p>

<p>Tolerance does not always develop uniformly to all aspects of
a drug's action. For example, while tolerance in time develops to
the sedative effects of barbiturates, the amount needed for a
lethal dose remains constant. On the other hand, tolerance seems
to develop to all the major effects of narcotics. It &quot;is
characterized by a shortened duration and decreased intensity of
the analgesic, sedative, and other CNS depressant effects as well
as by a marked elevation in the average lethal dose.&quot;&quot;
As observed in the section on toxicity, limits on tolerance have
not yet been determined. </p>

<p>Tolerance takes two forms. First, the body to some extent may
increase its ability to metabolize or excrete the drug. While
this has not been shown to be directly the case for the opiates,
it has been shown that brain morphine levels become lower in
tolerant than in nontolerant animals eight hours after drug
administration. Secondly, constant brain levels of morphine will
produce less effect in tolerant than in nontolerant animals,
indicating that there must be some form of adaptation within the
CNS at the cellular level. These two forms of tolerance are
called &quot;drug disposition&quot; and &quot;metabolic
tolerance,&quot; respectively. Several theories have been
developed to explain them-they are too complex to discuss
here-only to come to the same conclusion, namely, that &quot;the
precise mechanisms underlying these two forms of tolerance to
narcotics are not known.&quot;&quot; </p>

<p>In a study of drug addiction as a social problem, an important
issue is the speed with which tolerance develops. If, for
example, tolerance develops rapidly, then whenever an addict
increases his dose for a few days-or possibly even for a day-he
will become tolerant to the increased dose and must therefore
maintain at least that level of habit from then on to avoid
withdrawal symptoms. Experimental evidence indicates that
tolerance does develop rapidly. Human subjects have been brought
to a level of 500 mg. of morphine within ten days. Tolerance to
morphine begins with the first dose administered and builds
rapidly; tolerance to heroin lags for a few days, then follows
the same course. In animal experiments, it has been found that a
dog, when given morphine continuously for eight hours, will begin
to recover from behavioral depression by the end of that time,
indicating a rapid development of tolerance to a given
concentration of morphine in the body.&quot; </p>

<p>It is not clear whether tolerance increases arithmetically or
geometrically. For example, although a nonaddict might find 100
mg. of morphine fatal, none of the sources indicates whether a
dose of 200 mg. would be fatal to an addict who was already
taking 100 mg. per day, or whether a dose of 600 mg. would be
fatal to an addict on 500 mg. </p>

<p>Another important question is how long tolerance lasts after
an individual has been abstinent for a time. Generally, it is
believed that tolerance disappears when the drug taking stops.
There are numerous street stories to the effect that addicts will
voluntarily detoxify themselves to the point where their habit
becomes such as to be economically supportable. Yet, in one
classic experiment rats were found to retain substantial
tolerance to morphine for almost a year after the last
administration of the drug.&quot; </p>

<p>The final important aspect of tolerance is the phenomenon of
cross@tolerance between drugs. Morphine, heroin, methadone, and
meperidine are at least partial substitutes for one another, and
tolerance to one confers tolerance to equipotent doses of the
others. </p>

<p><i>Physical Dependence and Withdrawal. </i>The term
&quot;physical dependence&quot; or &quot;physical addiction&quot;
means that an organism requires a drug for &quot;normal&quot;
physical functioning. Abstinence will result in physical symptoms
of varying types and severity until the body adapts to the new
state. The term &quot;addiction,&quot; however, is eschewed by
experts in the drug-abuse field. Since drug abuse is dependent on
an intermixture of physical and psychic variables, and since
drugs of abuse are often used in such low doses that the degree
of actual physical addiction is questionable, experts feel that
it is more correct to use the terminology &quot;drug dependence
of the morphine type&quot; or &quot;drug dependence of the
barbiturate type.&quot;&quot; Even the withdrawal symptoms
developed by abstinent users may be psychogenic in origin. In
addition, users of drugs that are not powerfully addictive
physically (e.g., tobacco) sometimes have a more difficult time
in abstaining from use than do users of addictive drugs. For
these reasons, it makes some sense to blur the distinction
between physical and psychological dependence when discussing
drug abuse as a social problem. </p>

<p>This should not induce the belief, however, that there is no
such thing as physical addiction or physical dependence. Clearly,
an opiate user becomes physically dependent in the sense that
abstinence will cause severe and well-documented physical
symptoms. These include restlessness and drug craving, followed
by yawning, lacrimation, runny nose, perspiration, fever, chills,
vomiting, panting respiration, loss of appetite, insomnia,
hypertension, general aches and pains, and loss of weight. The
intensity can be &quot;nearly unbearable&quot; if the dosage is
high enough.&quot; </p>

<p>Several researchers have commented that withdrawal from
opiates-as well as from barbiturates and other hypnotics-is
characterized by <i>rebound hyperexcitability; </i>that is,
during withdrawal, the physiological systems that were depressed
by the drug are in a state of increased excitability. It is not
clear, however, whether all withdrawal symptoms are rebound
effects, or whether this is a general,rule applicable to other
drugs as well.&quot; </p>

<p>Withdrawal from the various opiates has been studied
scientifically. As a general rule, the intensity and duration of
the withdrawal symptoms are related to the intensity and duration
of the drug's action. Thus, morphine withdrawal starts within a
few hours (four to ten, depending on the user's tolerance level),
peaks rapidly (around the second day of abstinence), then
declines sharply. Most of the obvious symptoms disappear within
seven to ten days. Meperidine withdrawal reaches its peak in
about twelve hours and lasts only four or five days. In some
ways, however, its peak intensity is greater than that of
morphine withdrawal. Withdrawal from methadone follows a slower
course. No symptoms appear until about the third day. After this,
they increase steadily until between the sixth and the ninth day,
when they peak at a level less than two-thirds as intense as the
peak for morphine withdrawal. Thereafter, they decline slowly,
not disappearing until after about two weeks. The maximum
intensity of methadone withdrawal is always tolerable, but its
duration may be the factor that causes some addicts to regard the
withdrawal from methadone as nastier than the withdrawal from
morphine.&quot; </p>

<p>The disappearance of the gross symptoms does not mean,
however, that the withdrawal is complete. Increasingly,
researchers are finding some effects that persist for many weeks
longer, and empirical observations show that the relapse
vulnerability is greatest immediately after withdrawal. Dr.
William Martin divides the abstinence syndrome into <i>early and
protracted </i>abstinence. In human experiments, subjects were
stabilized on 240 mg. of morphine, then withdrawn slowly over a
period of three weeks. They showed the general withdrawal
symptoms discussed above, although in milder degree than occurs
after sudden withdrawal. The symptoms persisted to some extent
for six to nine weeks. After this, the protracted abstinence
syndrome emerged, characterized by minor physical differences
that persisted through the twenty-sixth week of withdrawal. The
clinical significance of this is not clear, for it has not been
proved that protracted abstinence contributes to readdiction. But
careful experiments with rats have shown that postaddict rats
have a greater liking for narcotics than do rats that have never
been addicted. This preference lasts four to six months after
withdrawal.&quot; </p>

<p>While no limit on the development of tolerance to opiates has
been found, there does seem to be a limit on the degree of
physical dependence that can be developed, as measured by the
intensity of the withdrawal symptoms. For morphine, this maximum
is reached at dosages of around 400-500 mg. per day; higher doses
do not result in more intense withdrawal symptoms.&quot; </p>

<p>This points up the fact that tolerance to, and physical
dependence on, a drug are not the same thing. The body can even
develop a tolerance to drugs on which it does not become
physically dependent. But tolerance is always present when
physical dependence develops. </p>

<p>In the case of the opiates, the speed with which physical
dependence develops seems to lag only slightly behind the speed
of the development of tolerance. A patient receiving therapeutic
doses of morphine for a week or two will not have recognizable
withdrawal symptoms spontaneously after discontinuance, but these
can be precipitated by an antagonist after only two or three days
on morphine. By similar means, withdrawal has been caused in a
dog after an eight-hour infusion of morphine. Goldstein believes
that physical dependence is probably initiated with the first
dose of the drug.&quot; At that stage, of course, withdrawal
would be so mild as to be unnoticeable, but it seems possible
that a single dose could create a craving for the drug, even
though the physical genesis of this feeling would be unknown to
the user. </p>

<p>As might be expected, there are no definitive explanations for
the phenomenon of physical dependence. Its existence is simply
defined by the presence or absence of withdrawal symptoms. Jaffe
states: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>At present no single model is able to account for all the
    complex phenomena that are seen with the many classes of
    drugs producing tolerance and physical dependence. It is
    likely that multiple mechanisms are involved, and that each
    model may reflect a facet of the truth. For the present the
    most heuristic models are the best ones <font size="1">.42 <br>
    </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Goldstein also observes that, although &quot;the mechanism of
the development of tolerance and physical dependence is still
unknown.... there has been no dearth of theoretical
speculation.&quot;&quot; It appears that dependence is due to
&quot;drug-induced alterations at the cellular level, with the
most prominent changes occurring in the CNS . . . these changes
are not limited to any one part of the CNS but occur throughout
the entire neuraxis.&quot;&quot; </p>

<p>The sources are silent, however, on two important questions
about physical dependence and tolerance. The first of these
concerns stabilization dosages. It is well known, for example,
that an addict can be stabilized on a drug, since taking a given
amount will result in neither withdrawal nor euphoria. But there
is little information on how much latitude there is in the
stabilization dose. That is, if a morphine addict is used to 100
mg., can he take anywhere between 90 and 100 mg. without becoming
aware of the difference; or is his tolerance of deviation from
his normal dose less than this? Also, are there variations
between the opiates, depending on peak intensity and duration of
action? Generally, experts believe that it is harder to stabilize
on such short-acting drugs as morphine and heroin than on
methadone. The short, sharp peak and rapid decay characteristic
of the morphine effect may mean that a dose insufficient to
produce euphoria soon results in bodily concentrations too low to
prevent withdrawal. </p>

<p>Another important question is whether the euphoric effect
disappears at high levels of opiate tolerance. That is, will an
addict who is used to 500 mg. of morphine achieve euphoria if he
takes 550 or 600 mg.? The fact that the severity of withdrawal
levels off at around this dose might indicate an upper limit on
the ability to obtain a euphoric effect. None of the sources
found, however, presents evidence to support either possibility. </p>

<p>Finally, it is well known that physical dependence on a given
opiate can be satisfied by any other opiate. This is the
pbenomenon of cross-dependence, described by Jaffe as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Cross-dependence may be partial or complete, and the
    degree is more closely related to pharmacological effects
    than to chemical similarities. A broad-spectrum drug such as
    methadone, which depresses the entire range of functions that
    are similarly affected by morphine, can completely substitute
    for morphine or meperidine. However, meperidine, which has a
    narrower spectrum with less autonomic and sedative effects,
    does not entirely prevent the autonomic manifestations of
    withdrawal from morphine. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>In general, any potent narcotic analgesic, regardless of
    chemical class, will show cross-dependence with other
    narcotic analgesics . <font size="1">. . . 45<br>
    </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="1">METHADONE MAINTENANCE </font></p>

<p>A successful method of treating heroin addicts is to maintain
them on daily doses of methadone. More detail about the programs
using this technique is contained in Staff Paper 3. </p>

<p>The pharmacological basis of methadone maintenance has been
covered in preceding sections, albeit implicitly. The significant
characteristics are as follows: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Methadone is a synthetic opiate. Its administration to a
        heroin addict will either prevent the withdrawal symptoms
        caused by abstinence from heroin or end them if they have
        already developed. </li>
    <li>Methadone and the other opiates exhibit cross-tolerance.
        A person tolerant to one of them is tolerant to
        equipotent doses of another. </li>
    <li>The action of oral methadone lasts about twenty-four
        hours. A methadone program can administer the drug once a
        day, rather than three or four times, as would be
        necessary if morphine or heroin were used. </li>
    <li>High doses of methadone (e.g., about 80 mg. or more) will
        prevent withdrawal, block the euphoric effect from an
        injection of heroin, and prevent the &quot;drug
        hunger&quot; (defined by Dr. Jerome Jaffe as &quot;a felt
        sense of physical abnormality&quot;) felt by addicts who
        have become abstinent. </li>
    <li>Lower doses of methadone (e.g., 50 mg.) will prevent
        withdrawal and the drug hunger. They will not block the
        euphoric effect of an injection of heroin, although
        presumably some minimum quantity of heroin is required.
        The success rate for programs using low doses is
        approximately the same as the rate for those using high
        doses for addicts in treatment six months. Experts
        believe that blocking the euphoria is not so important as
        preventing the drug hunger. </li>
    <li>No significantly harmful side effects of methadone have
        been discovered.<br>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The effects of methadone on the heroin addict have been
described diagrammatically by Dr. Vincent Dole.&quot;'<br>
</p>

<p>Fig. 1. Diagrammatic summary of the functional state of a
typical &quot;mainline&quot; heroin user. Arrow shows the
repetitive injection of heroin in uncertain dose, usually 10 to
30 mg but sometimes much more. Note that the addict is hardly
ever in a state of normal function (&quot;straight&quot;). </p>

<p>Fig. 2. Stabilization of the patient in a state of normal
function by blockade treatment. A single, daily, oral dose of
methadone prevents him from feeling symptoms of abstinence

takes a shot of heroin. Dotted line indicates the course if
methadone is omitted. </p>

<p>Fig. 3. The induction of narcotic tolerance by the gradual
increase of methadone dosage. Two typical patients are shown: one
starting with tolerance (from previous use of heroin) and the
other with little or no tolerance (e.g., recently in hospital or
jail). The right-hand ordinate shows the total daily dose of
methadone (given in divided portions during the first months);
the left-hand ordinate indicates the degree of narcotic blockade
on an arbitrary scale (O to ****). </p>

<p><img src="img00003.gif" align="bottom" width="1132"
height="397"> </p>

<p>Some important questions about the nature of methadone
treatment remain unanswered. Because methadone and heroin can be
substituted for each other in so many ways, it would seem logical
that their effects would be cumulative, and that the addict on
methadone would be able to achieve the euphoric state with a
smaller dose of heroin than he normally used. Certainly, other
drugs, such as alcohol and the barbiturates, have cumulative
effects. Yet, many of the discussions about methadone treatment
evidently assume, with actually saying so, that their effects are
not cumulative. </p>

<p>The explanation may lie in the pharmacological principle that
the body's response to many drugs is logarithmic, not linear.
That is, as the dosage is increased, steadily larger incremental
doses are required to produce a constant increment of response.
Heroin and methadone may be cumulative in their effects, but the
administration of methadone elevates the recipient to a point on
the dose-response curve where only very large additional amounts
of heroin have discernible impact.&quot; </p>

<p>In this context, it is important to remember the suggestion
made earlier that there may be a limit of 120-150 mg. per day of
heroin (the equivalent of 400-500 mg. of morphine) above which
additional amounts of the drug have no euphoric effect. If this
limit is roughly true, even with substantial individual
variations, then many methadone programs may simply boost the
addict to the point where he cannot attain euphoria. Either he
reaches this limit, which would be true at about 180 mg. per day
of methadone, or he reaches a dosage that leaves too small a
margin between his tolerance level and this limit for a euphoric
dose. Lower doses (e.g., 50 mg.) would not approach the euphoric
limit, but they might shift an addict to a point on the
doseresponse curve where the heroin dose he is used to taking
would not have any euphoric effect. </p>

<p><i>Physiological Factors Underlying Addiction. </i>It is
commonly assumed that the causes of addiction are psychological,
and that there is no inherent physical predisposition to
addiction. There is, however, no experimental evidence that would
rule out the possibility that drug addiction, or at least
vulnerability to drug addiction, has a physiological basis. As
Goldstein says: </p>

<p>Certainly socioenvironmental reasons can be found, <i>ex post
facto, to </i>explain each case of addiction to heroin, the
barbiturates, or alcohol, or of habituation to lysergic acid
diethylamide [LSD], marijuana, nicotine, or amphetamine. But most
people afflicted by the same adverse environmental circumstances
do not seek escape through drug abuse. Despite the present
paucity of evidence, therefore, the possibility should be
entertained that the characteristic effects of psychotropic drugs
upon mood, which underlie the development of drug abuse, may be
at least in part genetically determined. </p>

<p>Investigation in this field has not yet transcended the
difficulties of designing experiments free of self-selection or
other kinds of bias, and of working out methods suitable for
quantitation of subjective responses. It has been found, for
example, that housewives who drink large amounts of coffee
responded entirely differently to a test dose of caffeine in a
placebo-controlled experiment than did housewives who never drink
coffee. The coffee drinkers felt more alert and had a sense of
well-being after caffeine, as compared with placebo. The
non-drinkers obtained significantly fewer effects of this kind;
on the other hand, caffeine made them feel nervous and
&quot;jittery.&quot; But it is not known if the group habituated
to coffee would have reacted in the same way at an earlier age,
before their first exposure to caffeine. Large individual
differences are observed in the sensitivity of people to the
sleep-disturbing actions of caffeine, but again it is not clear
whether or not these are innate differences, independent of any
prior exposure to caffeine. One investigation on the coffee
drinking and smoking habits of monozygotic and dizygotic twins
suggests that these two kinds of drug-seeking behavior are
subject to genetic influences.411 </p>

<p>Dole has suggested that an addict may have an underlying
neurological vulnerability to addiction that is triggered by
opiate use.&quot; More recently, he has indicated that opiate use
may induce a metabolic change that will cause the body to crave
opiates thereafter.&quot; But he is not optimistic about the
potential of research on the question, given the present lack of
testable hypotheses that might explain it.&quot; </p>

<p>Another theory concerning physiological propensity to
addiction is more complex. Martin has suggested that an addict
has a particular physiological vulnerability to stress either
before he takes his first narcotic drug or after he starts taking
it. In Martin's view, this vulnerability is not lost after
withdrawal from the drug, and stress situations will trigger a
physiological reaction that results in a craving for the drug.
Martin believes that there is some experimental evidence for this
view and is more optimistic than Dole about possible
research.&quot;<br>

<p><b>THE HALLUCINOGENS</b> </p>

<p><i>The Drugs.&quot;</i> </p>

<p><i>LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) </i>is a synthetic drug
discovered in 1938. It is closely related to the ergot family,
and ergotamine tartate, used in treatment of migraine headaches,
can be used as raw material in the manufacture of LSD. </p>

<p><i>Mescaline,</i> an alkaloid of the peyote cactus, was
isolated in 1896. It is about .025 per cent as potent as LSD in
producing an altered state of consciousness. But it is probably
just as powerful. </p>

<p><i>Psilocybin</i> <i>and psilocin </i>are the active alkaloids
of the Mexican magic mushroom and are about 1 per cent as potent
as LSD. </p>

<p><i>DOM </i>(also called STP) and MDA are other hallucinogens
chemically related to both mescaline and amphetamine. </p>

<p>DMT (dimethyl tryptamine) is a short-acting hallucinogen. </p>

<p><i>Medical Uses.&quot;</i> Although there are no recognized
medical uses for the hallucinogens at present, some of them have
been, and are being, used experimentally for a variety of
research and therapeutic purposes. LSD and mescaline, for
instance, have been used for research on mental illness and in
psychotherapy. Since certain effects of these drugs mimic the
symptoms of schizophrenia in some ways, it has long been thought
that study of these effects will yield insights into the nature
and causes of psychotic states. A few experiments have been
conducted in which terminal-cancer patients are given LSD in
order to make the &quot;waiting for death&quot; period more
meaningful. Through the LSD experience, the patient learns to
live in the &quot;here and now,&quot; taking each day as it comes
rather than dwelling on his past. Alcoholics and drug addicts
have also been given LSD as part of more comprehensive courses of
treatment. </p>

<p><i>Physical Eflects and Toxicity. </i>LSD is effective when
taken orally, which is the usual method of administration. Some
users claim to have taken it nasally or by injection and state
that injected LSD produces a powerful rush. It produces some
somatic effects that are sympathomimetic, such as pupillary
dilation, increased blood pressure, tremor, nausea, muscular
weakness, and increased body temperature, but these effects are
usually minor. The major effects are almost entirely on the
CNS.&quot; </p>

<p>The effective dosage is quite small. Perceptual changes, the
most dramatic result, can be produced by as little as 251 mcg.
(micrograms). (I gram = 1,000 milligrams = 1,000,000
micrograms.)&quot; The standard dose taken by LSD users is
probably around 200 mcg., although the variability of street
drugs makes it difficult to be accurate. </p>

<p>Although no human deaths as a result of the pharmacological
action of LSD have been reported, animal deaths due to
respiratory failure have occurred in response to massive doses.
At present, it is not clear whether there is a fatal dose for
humans, but it is clear that the ratio of the lethal dose (if
there is one) to the therapeutic dose is very high. It is
difficult to determine the significance of animal experiments for
humans, because different species have markedly different
reactions. Some animals, for example, have been found to be
resistant to LSD; mice, in particular, detoxify the drug quickly,
and the half-life (the period within which half the drug is
metabolized) in a mouse is only seven minutes. In a human, the
half-life is approximately three to three-and-a-half hours; the
total duration of action of the drug is about twelve hours .57 </p>

<p>Despite claims to the contrary, there is no reliable evidence
that LSD causes birth defects. The early studies on this have
been discredited, and no definitive work has been done
since.&quot; One exhaustive study concluded that pure LSD, in
moderate doses, &quot;does not produce chromosome damage
detectable by available methods.&quot;&quot; This problem is
difficult to study, because that part of the population that uses
LSD heavily is also likely to be malnourished, careless about
hygiene and prenatal care, and prone to a variety of physical
problems. Since LSD seems to be a relatively specific drug, in
that it acts primarily on the CNS and has few peripheral effects,
it is not particularly logical to expect that it will produce
birth defects. It would be more sensible to study the large
number of legal drugs that have massive effects on various body
systems, because they would be more likely to affect the
reproductive system as well. The stress on birth defects as a
possible result of LSD appears to be motivated more by the desire
to prevent its use than by the desire to prevent birth defects. </p>

<p><i>Psychoactive Eflects.&quot; </i>The hallucinogens do not
produce hallucinations in the classic sense-it is rare for a user
to see things that are not there. Rather, perception is altered:
Afterimages are prolonged and overlap with present perceptions;
objects seem to move in a wavelike fashion or melt; and sensory
impressions become overwhelming. Synesthesia-a state where colors
are &quot;heard&quot; and sound is &quot;seen&quot;-is common. </p>

<p>Perhaps more important to the user than these perceptual
effects are the subjective effects. Time may seem to pass very
slowly; self-boundaries appear to disintegrate; and the user soon
comes to feel a sense of oneness with the universe. There may
also be a sense of unusual clarity, and one's thoughts may begin
to assume extraordinary importance. Moods may change radically,
from gaiety to depression, from elation to fear, or vice versa. </p>

<p>Many users attach great meaning to their experiences. Some
regard the use of LSD as a form of psychotherapy, since they
believe it increases <b>one's </b>self-knowledge and
self-awareness, largely through the recall of old and hitherto
buried memories. Others may go further and emphasize the mystical
and religious aspects of their drug-induced feelings. </p>

<p>Some of the possible, long-term psychological reactions were
examined in an experiment in which LSD was administered to
previously naive subjects. The subjects were given a number of
psychological tests-before taking LSD, immediately after the
experience, and six months later.&quot; All changes were quite
small; the main findings indicated a negative correlation between
the use of LSD, on the one hand, and aggression, competition, and
preference for structure and conformity, on the other. Rather, a
positive correlation with an increase in aesthetic appreciation
was found. One result of the experiment was proved particularly
illuminating: Fifty-nine per cent of the subjects who had been
given 200 mg. of LSD thought that the drug had had lasting
effects on their personality, even though the tests
&quot;provided only minimal supportive evidence.&quot;&quot; In
the control groups, none of those given 25 mg. of LSD, and 13 per
cent of those given 20 mg. of amphetamine, had similar feelings
about the experience. While other researchers have found a
negative correlation between chronic LSD use and aggression and
competition,&quot; there is a self selected quality to the
voluntary chronic user that did not exist in the above
experiment. </p>

<p>The major short-term risk of taking LSD is the &quot;bad
trip,&quot; a term used to describe several different types of
adverse experiences. A mild adverse reaction can mean only that
the images and feelings during the experience were unpleasant. At
the other extreme, a serious panic reaction, accompanied by
immense anxiety and fear, may occur. Bad trips are probably
common, but most of them do not reach the severe level. </p>

<p>Under clinical conditions, serious adverse reactions appear to
be rare. In one study, for instance, it was found that 25,000
administrations of LSD to 5,000 people in clinical settings had
resulted in only 0.08 per cent serious reactions in experimental
subjects and 0.34 per cent in subjects undergoing therapy.
&quot;Serious&quot; was defined as causing either suicide or a
suicide attempt or a psychotic break lasting more than
forty-eight hours. 14 </p>

<p>Of course, most LSD use does not take place under clinical
conditions; some observers believe that such use may therefore
result in higher percentages of adverse effects, for several
reasons. To begin with, putative LSD may be heavily adulterated
with substances ranging from strychnine to methamphetamine. Also,
use of LSD has been an illegal and deviant activity; this may
make users anxious and more susceptible to bad reactions. It is
also possible that a higher proportion of street users have
psychological factors impelling them toward deviant behavior than
would be true of an experimental population. Age differences may
also be an important factor in adverse reactions (a theory in the
field is that young users are more likely to lack the experience
and identity that enable a more mature person to handle the
powerful impact of the drug) . </p>

<p>One could, of course, argue the precise opposite on almost
every point made in the last paragraph. For example, street users
may seek out warm and supportive settings that reduce the
incidence of bad reactions as compared with the clinical setting.
LSD use may be deviant in the context of the larger culture but
not in the subculture within which most users live. Older people,
generally more rigid in their attitudes, may resist the drug
effect and panic, while younger people, being more flexible, may
accept -the drug experience more easily. Contact with a
subculture in which LSD is common may reduce fear of the drug,
regardless of age, more than will clinical reassurances. </p>

<p>At present, there is no rational way to choose between these
arguments. It should be emphasized that reports of large numbers
of serious adverse reactions among street users have not been
documented. What evidence there is consists mostly of anecdotes. </p>

<p>Chlorpromazine, a powerful tranquilizer used in the treatment
of psychiatric illness, will counter the physical effects of <b>LSD
</b>almost immediately. If, however, the LSD user is having a
panic reaction, it may continue in spite of the chlorpromazine.
Physicians familiar with this phenomenon believe that
chemotherapy may prolong panic because of the anxiety its
administration arouses in the patient. &quot;Talking the patient
down&quot; in a calm manner is the preferred treatment .115 </p>

<p>There are some long-term risks associated with LSD use. In
some individuals, prolonged negative effects are associated with
use of hallucinogens; cases of serious depression, paranoid
behavior, and prolonged psychotic episodes have been documented.
Whether the hallucinogens cause these effects is not clear. LSD
may serve only to precipitate them in someone who is about to
have such a problem anyway. The frequency of such effects is not
known. </p>

<p>Another possible long-term effect of the hallucinogens is the
flashbacks recurrence of some aspect of the drug experience vhen
the subject is nor under the influence of the drug. The flash)ack
encompasses a wide range of possible LSD-like perceptual or
subjective effects of varying degrees of severity and duration,
lasting from a few minutes to several hours and occurring with
indeterminate frequency. The user is not affected between
experiences. Causation has not been definitely proved, however,
and it could be that a controlled experiment would find similar
experiences in a non-LSD-using populations&quot; </p>

<p>The most common type of flashback recorded is the recurrence
of perceptual distortion; the rarest is the recurrence of altered
physical sensation; and the most dangerous is the recurrence of
disturbing emotion and panic. (This may be hard to distinguish
from the depressive reaction or schizophrenic episodes discussed
above.) The last two types of flashbacks are more likely to occur
after a bad trip than after a good one. </p>

<p>Assuming that flashbacks are caused by LSD, the mechanism
responsible is a mystery. The theory that LSD persists in the
nervous system is not compatible with its known short life, and
the theory of a persistent, undiscovered metabolite is
incompatible with the wide variations in onset and duration.
Nevertheless, there is no lack of other theories, ranging from
semipermanent changes in the optic pathways, to learned responses
to stress, to dissociative reactions. Generally, it is probably
psychological rather than chemical, but, given the lack of
knowledge about the relationship between psychological and
chemical events, this conclusion does not tell very much.&quot; </p>

<p>There is no information on the incidence of flashbacks, the
extent to which they occur after only one LSD experience, or the
relative frequency of the different types. </p>

<p>The effects of the other hallucinogens are similar to those of
LSD. Mescaline, which lasts as long and has about the same
effects, although it is less potent, seems to be the usergs drug
of choice. It is unclear whether this preference is due to the
publicity regarding possible birth defects caused by LSD or to
some subtle difference in effect. It may just as well be due to
the belief of many users that natural substances are superior to
synthetics, a factor that may also account for the preference for
the mushroom hallucinogens. This question has not been studied
clinically, and it is difficult to know the effects of natural
hallucinogens, since they are rarely available. Most street
mescaline is either LSD or LSD plus speed or some other
adulterant. </p>

<p>DOM (STP), MDA, and some other drugs are a cross between
hallucinogens and amphetamines. The duration of action of DOM is
sixteen to twenty-four hours, and rough observations indicate
that the incidence of panic reactions and flashbacks has been
higher than that associated with LSD. The physiological effects
(rapid heart rate, dry mouth, dilated pupils) are also more
pronounced. It is possible that, when the drug first appeared,
users were more prone to panic, because they were not prepared
for the long duration and greater physical reaction.&quot; Jaffe
states that low doses of DOM give some of the subjective effects
of LSD without the perceptual or hallucinogenic effects, although
the drug has typical psychedelic action at higher doses.&quot; </p>

<p>According to some sources, MDA causes an LSD-type reaction for
the first six to eight hours, but it also has amphetaminelike
effects that persist for a longer time. Other reports are that
MDA is <i>sui generis, </i>with LSD-like subjective feelings but
without the perceptual distortion of LSD or
depersonalization.&quot; </p>

<p>DMT is a hallucinogen whose effects last only forty-five
minutes to an hour. It is sometimes called &quot;the
businessman's lunch.&quot; </p>

<p><i>Tolerance. </i>Tolerance to the hallucinogens develops
rapidly. If taken daily for three or four days, LSD will cease to
have any substantial effect.&quot; The tolerance does not appear
to be so closely tied to the dosage as in the case with other
drugs to which tolerance develops-that is, it seems that one
cannot achieve the desired effect simply by increasing the dose.
The sources, however, are ambivalent on this. Sensitivity returns
after a few days of abstinence. </p>

<p>There is cross-tolerance among LSD, mescaline, and psilocybin
but not between any of these and the amphetamines.&quot; There is
no information on DOM, MDA, or DMT on this point. </p>

<p><i>Physical Dependence and Withdrawal. </i>Hallucinogens such
as LSD and mescaline do not produce physical dependence, and
there are no withdrawal symptoms after discontinuation.&quot;
Again, there appears to be little information on DOM, MDA, or
DMT; at least, there are no reports of dependence or withdrawal.
They are likely to be about the same as LSD. </p>

<p><i>Mechanisms of Action. </i>A number of CNS effects of LSD
are known; the manner in which LSD causes these effects, however,
is still not known. LSD and the other hallucinogens interfere
with the production and action of serotonin (also called 5-HT or
5-hydroxytryptamine) in the brain. This is an important body
substance with significant effects on many organ systems. But,
since the functions of serotonin in the CNS are not known, this
does not represent substantial progress in understanding
LSD.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p><b>CANNABIS&quot;<br>
</b></p>

<p><i>The Drugs. Cannabis sativa, </i>the hemp plant, grows
almost everywhere in the world. It flourishes in hot, dry
climates, and it is generally believed that plants produced in
such regions have the most pronounced psychoactive effects. <i>Marijuana
</i>consists of the chopped leaves and stems of the cannabis
plant. It is usually smoked, but it can be taken orally. <i>Hashish
</i>is formed of resin scraped from the flowering top of the
cannabis plant. It, too, can be smoked or eaten, and it is
thought to be about five to eight times as potent as marijuana.
Some experts believe there are qualitative differences in effect
as well as simple differences in potency. <i>Kil, bhang, and
gania </i>are other preparations of cannabis used in various
parts of the world. Their potency lies between that of marijuana
and that of hashish. </p>

<p>The most important psychoactive ingredient of cannabis is
known to be delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), but the
possibility of additional ingredients exercising some effect has
not been precluded. </p>

<p><i>Cannabis </i>is a difficult drug to classify. Although it
is often referred to as a mild hallucinogen, it does not have
many of the effects associated with hallucinogens, and probably
has a different mechanism of action altogether. It also has some
sedative effects but lacks many of the other characteristics of
the sedative hypnotics. With good reason, therefore, it is
usually classified as unique.&quot; </p>

<p><i>Medical Uses. </i>There is no accepted medical use for <i>cannabis
</i>in the United States. In the past, especially during the late
nineteenth century, it was quite popular among European and
American doctors, who prescribed it for a variety of ailments
ranging from menstrual cramps to migraine headaches. It was thus
used generally as a mild anodyne (pain killer) or
tranquilizer-but it may have more specific effects as well.&quot;
</p>

<p>By the early twentieth century, the use of <i>cannabis </i>for
medical purposes had declined, largely because of inconsistency
in the potency of the drug. Since <i>cannabis </i>was cultivated
in many places with wide variations in climatic and soil
conditions, no physician could be sure of potency of any given
batch. This made it difficult to predict results. It also
inhibited research, since nonreplication of scientific findings
might invariably have been due to differences in the drugs used. </p>

<p>Another problem was that there was no satisfactory way to
administer the drug for medical purposes. Smoking is not a
medically acceptable method, because the doctor cannot know how
much of the drug is being inhaled and absorbed. Oral
administration is possible, but effects are delayed. Moreover,
since neither the plant material nor the resin is soluble in
water, injection is difficult. Thus, as other drugs became
available-particularly the barbiturate sedative hypnotics, which
began appearing on the market in <i>1903-cannabis </i>was
replaced. </p>

<p>Almost no research has been done on the drug since the late
nineteenth century, and government policies made such research
impossible from 1937 to about 1968. Whether <i>cannabis </i>has
unique medical uses or is in some ways superior to common
tranquilizers now in use is therefore an open question. A revival
of interest is now taking place, however, in the medical
community. For example, several doctors are using <i>cannabis </i>to
treat migraine headaches, and some research is being done into
its effectiveness as a treatment for epilepsy. Certain variants
of THC may lower the blood pressure of hypertensive people.&quot;
</p>

<p>The isolation and synthesis of THC-achieved in the early
1960's-has promoted such research by making consistency in dosage
conceivable for the first time. In addition, NIMH has a project
under way to cultivate <i>cannabis </i>in Mississippi, with the
objective of providing drugs of constant quality to researchers.
But there are still problems: For example, there is some evidence
that THC is subject to oxidation, and that the potency of <i>cannabis
</i>may therefore change over a period of time that varies with
storage methods. Also, THC is expensive to synthesize and remains
in short supply. Recent work has developed at least one water
soluble derivative of THC with a pharmacological profile similar
to that of the original drugs. This should aid research further. </p>

<p><i>Physical Effects and Toxicity. </i>The immediate physical
effects <i>of cannabis </i>on man are mild. Heart rate is
increased moderately. There is a dilation of the conjunctival
blood vessels (i.e., a reddening of the eyes) and sometimes an
increase in heart rate. There appear to be no changes in
respiratory rate, pupil size, or blood-sugar level. After a
single inhaled dose, measurable physical effects reach a maximum
within half an hour and diminish three to five hours later.&quot;
When <i>cannabis </i>is eaten, the effects are delayed for
several hours, and symptoms may persist for up to twenty-four
hours. </p>

<p>As discussed in the next section, subjective effects of high
doses of the cannabinols may be similar to those of LSD. This has
led some to classify them as mild hallucinogens. Physical effects
are not the same, however, because <i>cannabis </i>does not have
the stimulating effects of LSD and has sedative properties that
LSD lacks. There is no cross-tolerance between the cannabinols
and the hallucinogens.&quot; </p>

<p>At present, there is no reliable evidence of organic damage,
and the most that can be said against <i>cannabis </i>is that the
effects of long-term or heavy use have not been ascertained. To
be sure, heavy, long-term smokers of <i>cannabis </i>develop
bronchial disorders, but these seem no different from the
difficulties experienced by heavy smokers of tobacco. Reports of
long-term brain damage are suspect, at best. For one thing, they
derive from studies of <i>cannabis </i>users in underdeveloped
countries, such as India and Morocco. These studies, furthermore,
are skewed by the fact that they used inmates of mental
institutions as subjects and assumed a causative relation if they
found that the inmates had been users of <i>cannabis. </i>Scientific
protective devices, such as control groups and blind studies,
were lacking. The recent crash program of federal research has
not filled this gap, and many experts do not expect that it will
do so. In this view, gross organic damage would have been found
before now, and long term subtle damage is difficult to study
retrospectively. </p>

<p>The lethal dose of THC for humans has not been determined, but
it is known that the cannabinols are not very toxic: There has
yet to be a report of a human death due to an overdose of THC.
Animal experiments have found that the 16thal dose for rats is
between 800 and 1,400 milligrams of drug per kilogram of body
weight for oral administration. Extrapolating from studies in
mice, the ratio of the lethal dose to the effective dose for
humans would be about 40,000 to 1. (The effective dose is that
amount necessary to produce clinically desired effects. For THC
in humans, it is about 50 micrograms per kilogram.) By way of
comparison, the ratio for barbiturates is about 10 to 1&quot; </p>

<p>Recent research has found that injected THC has a half-life in
the body of fifty-six hours, and that traces can be found in the
urine for up to eight days. There is also a possibility that it
may accumulate in lung or fat tissue.&quot; The clinical
implications of these facts, however, are not known. </p>

<p><i>Psychoactive Effects. </i>The general effect of <i>cannabis
</i>is &quot;a subtle mood change not easily perceived by the
novice.&quot;&quot; The most common mood encouraged by the drug
is a sense of increased well-being, but this is heavily dependent
on the setting and expectations of the user. The nervousness that
may accompany first use, for example, can negate any reaction to
the drug. Set and setting help to produce a wide range of
reactions and may be more crucial determinants of the effects of <i>cannabis
</i>use than those of most other drugs.&quot; The effects
described below are those observed in clinical trials and
obtained from interviews with users. </p>

<p>One important effect is the enhancement of the senses.
Sensitivity to colors, sounds, patterns, textures, and taste is
greatly increased. Perception of space and time is distorted in
ways that can be either pleasing or disconcerting. In particular,
time passes very slowly. Inhibitions may be relaxed in a manner
reminiscent of the effects of low doses of alcohol. The subject
may develop a sense of being in a fantasy or dreamlike state (an
effect achieved also by sedatives and anesthetics). </p>

<p>In clinical experiments, large doses of THC have produced
LSD-type experiences, but this requires quantities of THC far in
excess of the concentrations found in organic <i>cannabis. Real </i>hallucinations
do not occur. </p>

<p>The dose-response curve of THC has not yet been established;
nor have systematic comparisons of THC and LSD been made. </p>

<p>Significant adverse reactions to <i>cannabis </i>are rare, but
they do occur. They are more common when strong forms, such as
hashish, are used. There are four types that may result: </p>

<p>(1) simple depression, (2) a panic state, (3) toxic psychosis,
and (4) psychotic break. </p>

<p>Of the four, the simple depression reaction is the mildest and
most common. Its genesis is not known. People may be responding
idiosyncratically to pharmacological effects of the drug; or <i>the
cannabis </i>may intensify pre-existing but suppressed
psychological states or traits. It is likely, also, that the
different explanations might each account for some of the
depressions seen. In any event, the reaction ends spontaneously. </p>

<p>The panic reaction occurs when a user interprets the use or
effects of <i>cannabis </i>as a threat to life or sanity. It is
most likely to occur in subjects with no prior drug experience
who are ambivalent toward drug use and possibly fearful of police
arrest. Verbal and personal support by peers is the most
effective therapy; hospitalization and the use of tranquilizers
are usually contraindicated unless the person is highly
agitated.&quot; </p>

<p>Many panic reactions have been misdiagnosed as examples of
toxic psychosis-a condition in which the presence of toxins in
the body causes organic malfunction in the cerebral cortex and a
resultant psychotic state. This reaction is even rarer than the
panic reaction and ends when the toxins are flushed from the
system. A user is vulnerable to such a reaction when consuming <i>cannabis
</i>in concentrated forms, especially if the drug is mixed with
food and drink. The effects are delayed while the drug is being
absorbed, and the user cannot use the effects of the drug as a
measure of when he has had enough. In the view of some experts,
smoking <i>cannabis </i>allows the user to regulate consumption
in reaction to the immediate effects of the drug's passing into
the blood stream via the lungs. </p>

<p>The view that differences in reaction to the two methods of
administration are due to control of dosage can be questioned,
however. Dr. Andrew Weil states: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This theory of autotitration sounds nice, but I do not see
    it happen much. Most marijuana smokers I know smoke as much
    as they are handed. What is interesting is that one reaches
    some sort of ceiling in smoking: beyond a certain point, one
    does not get any higher, only more sedated. With oral
    ingestion, on the other hand, one can <br>
    easily get into the toxic range. These observations suggest
    pharmacological differences between the two routes of
    administration.86<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The use of <i>cannabis </i>may also trigger a psychotic break
in individuals who have normal psychological histories. Although
evidence is scarce, the degree of risk is probably very small. A
recent study reviewed twelve cases of <i>cannabis-related </i>psychotic
breaks arising over a ten-month period among soldiers stationed
in Vietnam. Only two of the twelve had &quot;significant
psychiatric histories and diagnosis of personality
disorder.&quot; In all cases, the reaction occurred after the
first use of <i>cannabis </i>and was self limiting, in that the
condition cleared spontaneously.&quot; Since about 30 per cent of
the 500,000 American soldiers in Vietnam at the time had probably
consumed <i>cannabis </i>at least once, often in potent form, the
incidence seems low. </p>

<p>Other data support this conclusion. During a fifteen-month
period, approximately 30,000 persons were treated at the Haight
Ashbury Clinic for a variety of medical and psychiatric problems.
An estimated 95 per cent had used <i>cannabis. </i>No case of a
psychotic break was recorded.&quot; </p>

<p>The risk of a psychotic break may be higher for users who have
a history of mental disorder. There is some evidence to support
this, but there are no statistical data on the degree to which
such population is at greater risk than &quot;normals.&quot; </p>

<p><i>Tolerance. Cannabis </i>appears to have the unusual
property of &quot;reverse tolerance,&quot; in that regular users
are more sensitive to the drug than novices. This characteristic
has been conventional wisdom within the drug culture for some
time; it is supported by a recent scientific study that used
radioactive isotope tagging to detect THC in body tissues several
days after the drug had been injected. The conclusion was that
THC may accumulate in the body, so that a regular user may
already have a &quot;basic dose&quot; and require only a small,
additional amount to obtain a psychoactive effect.&quot; </p>

<p>It is not known whether pharmacological tolerance to <i>cannabis
</i>develops. Because of the &quot;reverse tolerance&quot;
effect, experts have assumed that there was no such tolerance;
but, if the effects are cumulative, then &quot;reverse
tolerance&quot; in users could be accompanied by pharmacological
tolerance. For example, when synhexyl, a potent synthetic <i>cannabis
</i>derivative, is administered, tolerance develops in four to
six days.&quot; </p>

<p><i>Physical Dependence. </i>There is little evidence that
physical dependence develops with the consumption of <i>cannabis,
</i>and no significant withdrawal symptoms accompany cessation of
use. If dependence of any kind develops, it is probably
psychological, but even this appears to be minimal.&quot; </p>

<p><i>Mechanisms of Action. </i>The way in which <i>cannabis
causes </i>CNS effects is not known. </p>

<p><i>Additional Sources. </i>A number of comprehensive reviews
of marijuana have recently been published, taking up many of the
above issues in greater depth. Some of these are </p>

<p><b>THE MAJOR STIMULANTS<br>
</b></p>

<p><i>The Drugs.&quot; </i>This category of drugs includes those
that have the effect of stimulating physical and mental activity
and of providing a feeling of such stimulation to the user: </p>

<p><i>Amphetamines </i>are synthetic drugs that are part of the
general category of sympathomirnetic agents-a group of drugs
whose effects resemble the response to stimulation of certain
nerves of the sympathetic nerve system (hence
&quot;sympathomimetic&quot;). They are CNS stimulants. </p>

<p><i>Methamphetamine </i>is a close relative of the
amphetamines. The major distinction is that it has a different
ratio between central effects and peripheral actions than do the
basic amphetamines. Small doses of methamphetamine produce
prominent central stimulant reactions without significant
peripheral effects. </p>

<p><i>Cocaine </i>is an alkaloid of the coca plant. In general
effects, it is quite similar to the amphetamines. </p>

<p><i>Methylphenidate (Ritalin) </i>is a mild CNS stimulant,
between caffeine and the amphetamines in its effects. </p>

<p><i>Phenmetrazine (Preludin) </i>is also a sympathomimetic
agent. Its effects are almost indistinguishable from those of
amphetamines. </p>

<p>This section discusses amphetamines primarily, as the
prototype. Significant differences are noted as relevant. </p>

<p><i>Medical Uses.&quot; </i>The amphetamines are used to treat
a rare condition called narcolepsy-the inability to stay awake.
They are also used in the treatment of obesity because of their
characteristic of depressing the appetite centers, but the
results in this area are unimpressive. Amphetamines are useful in
the treatment of children with hyperkinesis. This condition,
which is also called minimal brain dysfunction, is one in which a
child shows an inability to concentrate, a deficiency in motor
skills, a low frustration level, and often an abnormal EEG
pattern. </p>

<p>Quasimedical uses are very common. Amphetamines increase
short-term physical and mental performance and are widely used by
people who desire this effect, such as students and athletes.
They are also used by people who have become dependent on or
habituated to them to maintain their normal level of functioning.
</p>

<p>Cocaine is not used medically for any of the above purposes,
but it is used as a local anesthetic. </p>

<p>Ritalin is effective in treating hyperkinesis and, because it
is milder than the amphetamines, may be the drug of choice.&quot;
</p>

<p><i>Physical Effects and Toxicity. </i>In different relative
degrees, sympathomimetic agents have the following major
actions:&quot; </p>

<p>A peripheral excitatory action on such smooth muscles as those
in blood vessels supplying the skin and on salivary and some
sweat glands; </p>

<p>A peripheral inhibitory effect on other types of smooth
muscles, such as those in the wall of the gut, on the bronchial
tree, and on the blood vessels supplying the skeletal muscle; A
cardiac excitatory action that increases heart rate and force of
contraction; </p>

<p>Certain metabolic actions; </p>

<p>CNS excitatory actions, such as respiratory stimulation and
others. </p>

<p>Amphetamines follow this scheme. Blood pressure is increased,
and the smooth muscle responses, while somewhat unpredictable,
are as indicated. The amphetamines are more potent in their CNS
effects than other drugs in the group, and it is through the
effects on the CNS that they stimulate respiration, depress the
appetite, and reverse fatigue. The results of an oral dose of 10
to 30 mg. of amphetamine (the standard therapeutic dose is 10
mg.) are wakefulness, alertness, decreased sense of fatigue,
elevation of mood with increased initiative, confidence, and
ability to concentrate, elation and euphoria, and an increase in
motor and speech activity. Prolonged use or heavy dosage is
followed by mental depression and fatigue. </p>

<p>Cocaine has the same effects as the amphetamines. The major
difference is that the effects of the amphetamines last several
hours, while those of cocaine seem to last only minutes.&quot;
Ritalin has less motor effect on motor and mental activities than
do the amphetamines. Some CNS effect is produced by doses that
have little effect on respiration and blood pressure.&quot; </p>

<p>The amphetamines can be quite toxic. Severe reactions have
occurred with only 30 mg., and death has resulted from 120 mg. of
injected amphetamine. The range is wide, however, and doses of
400 to 500 mg. have been survived by nontolerant individuals.
Death from overdose is quite rare, possibly because the ratio of
lethal to effective psychoactive dose is high for a tolerant
user.&quot; </p>

<p>Cocaine is toxic because the central stimulation that is the
immediate effect of the drug is followed by depression of the
higher nervous centers. Death from respiratory depression occurs
when the vital medullary centers are sufficiently depressed. The
fatal dose of cocaine has been estimated to be about 1.2 grams
taken at one time, but severe toxic effects have been reported on
doses as low as 20 mg.&quot; </p>

<p>The basic symptoms of amphetamine poisoning are extensions of
its normal therapeutic effects on the CNS, the cardiovascular
system, and the gastrointestinal system. A fatal dose ends in
convulsions and coma. Cerebral hemorrhage is a common autopsy
finding, but it is rarely massive. &quot;Pathological findings in
both man and animals are generally nonspecific and show pulmonary
congestion and often congestion of other organs including the
brain.&quot;&quot;' </p>

<p>Amphetamines are usually taken orally, but they can be
injected. Cocaine is not effective when taken orally, but it can
be snorted and absorbed through the mucous membrane or taken
intravenously. Medically, cocaine is only applied to body
surfaces as a local anesthetic; it is not injected or used
internally. </p>

<p>The major, long-term toxic effect of amphetamine use is a
paranoid psychosis that is often indistinguishable from a
schizophrenic reaction. This can occur after continued use or
even after an extremely heavy single dose. It usually disappears
within a week if the individual stops using the drug. Cocaine can
cause the same condition even more rapidly. </p>

<p>Whether these drugs cause long-term organic damage to the body
is at present unknown. Some experts who have worked with
amphetamine users believe that there is a long-term deterioration
that is explicable only in terms of organic damage. At present,
however, this has not been definitely established. In animal
experiments, death often results from continued administration of
methampbetamine, but the reason appears to be that the animal's
disinterest in food, combined with its hyperactivity, results in
a malnourished conditi6n that leaves it vulnerable to infection.
There have been some preliminary reports attributing arterial
disease to methamphetarnine use, but these have not yet been
substantiated and should not be accepted until further evidence
develops. </p>

<p>Hepatitis is very common among amphetamine users. This is to
be expected when hypodermic needles are used without proper
sterilization, but its incidence goes even beyond the level
logically attributable to this cause alone. Some consideration is
now being given to the possibility that amphetamine is itself
directly toxic to the liver. No clinical evidence on this
possibility has been developed, however, and it remains only a
possibility.&quot;' </p>

<p><i>Psychoactive Effects. </i>When taken orally, amphetamines
produce an elevation of mood and feeling of power and intensity
that many persons find quite pleasurable. The drugs increase
concentration and physical and mental performance and reduce
fatigue. Some users claim that orgasms are delayed and made more
intense when they occur, but no objective experiments have been
done. </p>

<p>The drugs produce the same effect even when taken
intravenously. In addition, the user obtains a &quot;rush&quot;
that is reputed to be different from, although related to, the
effect obtained from opiate injection. Again, sexual analogies
are often made by users. It is difficult to know whether the rush
is a product of the drug itself or of the process of intravenous
injection. Some users actually prefer impure methamphetamine
because of the belief that the impurities cause a faster, more
intense rush.&quot;' </p>

<p>As the dosage increases, the experience seems to become more
fragmented. Increased ability to concentrate turns either into a
compulsion to do repetitive tasks over and over or into a total
focusing of attention on some object or toy. Heavy users have a
compulsion to take mechanical objects apart and a similar
compulsion to try (unsuccessfully) to put them together again.
Such repetitive behavior occurs in animals as well as in
humans.&quot;' </p>

<p>Eventually-and fairly predictably-heavy amphetamine use during
a limited period of time will result in paranoid ideation and the
toxic psychosis discussed above. To some extent, users are aware
of this aspect of amphetamine use and can make allowances for it
during the experience. They will not act on moderate ideas of
persecution or visual illusions. If the run continues long
enough, this control will be lost. </p>

<p>Some heavy users may become chronically psychotic, in that
they exhibit psychotic symptoms even when not taking the drug.
The California experience is that normal functioning returns over
a period of six to twelve months, although the user himself may
feel some residual disablement .104 </p>

<p>Cocaine has roughly the same effects as amphetamines in terms
of creating feelings of well-being, euphoria, and power.
According to the accounts of users, these feelings are even
stronger with cocaine than with the amphetamines, but reliable
evidence is unobtainable. </p>

<p>Tolerance.&quot; Tolerance to most effects of the amphetamines
develops rapidly, and very high dosage levels can be reached. A
speed user on a run may inject as much as a gram of the drug
every two or three hours around the clock for several days.
Whether this is drug disposition or cellular tolerance is not
known. The development of tolerance is not uniform, however, and
the ability to withstand what would otherwise be a fatal dose
does not confer tolerance to the toxic psychosis. </p>

<p>It is not certain that tolerance to cocaine develops. There
are reports of very large doses-such as 10 grams per day-but
individuals seem able to tolerate the same doses after a period
of abstinence as before. it is known that the liver is extremely
effective at detoxifying cocaine and can process a lethal dose
every hour. </p>

<p>There are no reports of cross-tolerance between cocaine and
the amphetamines, but cross-tolerance between amphetamine and the
other stimulants has been reported clinically. </p>

<p><i>Physical Dependence. </i>For a long time, it was believed
that there were no withdrawal symptoms from amphetamines and
therefore no physical dependence. At present, it is thought that
the prolonged sleep, lassitude, and depression that follow
discontinuation of the drug are greater than would be
attributable to the preceding loss of sleep and weight. These may
be withdrawal symptoms. In addition, the percentage of REM sleep
increases after discontinuance of amphetamine, returns to normal
when amphetamine is given, and rises again when amphetamine is
withheld. This meets the criteria for a withdrawal
symptom.&quot;' The sources are silent, however, on the extent to
which these symptoms are dose-related. </p>

<p>Some experts in the field believe that amphetamines are far
more dangerous than the opiates. This is related not only to the
typicality of the euphoric effect but also to the problems of
tolerance and stabilization. Dr. Weil elaborates: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In fact, amphetamine dependence is more serious than
    narcotic dependence because it is inherently less stable.
    When a person begins using a tolerance-producing drug, he
    must soon face the problem of trying to stabilize his use in
    order to keep his life from being disrupted. More than any
    other class of drugs, the amphetamines foil the user's
    attempt to reach equilibrium with his habit because they
    produce such powerful and unrelenting tolerance.
    Consequently, users develop erratic patterns of use such as
    &quot;spree shooting,&quot; alternation with barbiturates
    and, eventually, with heroin. The high correlation of
    amphetamine use with impulsive and violent behavior is
    consistent with this pharmacological instability.107 <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because intensive use of amphetamines is a relatively recent
phenomenon, there is little information on such problems as
readdiction vulnerability, physiological bases of abuse, or
comparative success of different methods of treatment. There is
no treatment comparable to methadone, but neither is there any
particular evidence that such treatment is needed. The pattern of
heavy amphetamine use is probably too hard to sustain for an
extended period of time anyway, and there is increasing
indication that heavy amphetamine users eventually turn to
&quot;down&quot; drugs, such as heroin or barbiturates.&quot;' </p>

<p><i>Mechanisms of Action. </i>There are several theories about
the mechanisms of the CNS effects of the amphetamines, most based
on analogies to their peripheral effects, but none is
definitive.&quot;' While the effects of all the drugs are
similar, the mechanisms may be different; for example, there are
probably significant differences between the amphetamines and
cocaine.&quot;'<br>

<p><b>BARBITURATES AND TRANQUILIZERS<br>
</b></p>

<p><i>The Drugs.&quot;'</i> Barbiturates and tranquilizers are
sedatives (calming agents), hypnotics (sleep-inducing agents),
and depressants. The category encompasses a wide range of drugs
of different families. For example, over 2,500 barbiturates have
been synthesized, and at least twelve are in common clinical use.
In the area of nonbarbiturate hypnotics, Sharpless lists
twenty-three commonly used drugs belonging to ten different
families. In addition to these two groups, there are a number of
major tranquilizers that are used in the treatment of psychiatric
disorders. </p>

<p>More is known about these drugs than about those discussed in
previous sections. This is in part because they have been in wide
use for a long time, and in part because most of them have more
general effects than do other drugs of abuse. Drugs of this
category act on a number of bodily systems besides the CNS, and
these other systems are more easily studied. This section
discusses the effects of the drugs only insofar as these are
relevant to their abuse potential. </p>

<p>The major drugs involved are as follows: </p>

<p><i>Barbiturates </i>are derivatives of barbituric acid; they
were first used medically in 1903. The major abused drugs in the
series are secobarbital and pentobarbital. </p>

<p><i>Meprobamate (Equinil, Miltown), glutethimide (Doriden),
chlordiazepoxide (Librium), and diazepam (Valium) </i>are CNS
depressants belonging to several different families. Medically,
they are regarded as anti-anxiety agents-not hypnotics-and they
and similar drugs are called the minor tranquilizers. </p>

<p>One group of powerful tranquilizers, the <i>phenothiazines
(Chlorpromazine),</i> are not covered. While they are in common
use, especially for the treatment of serious mental illness, this
class of drugs does not appear to be abused.&quot;' There is no
satisfactory explanation of why they are not attractive to drug
abusers. Obviously, their psychoactive effects must differ
significantly from those of barbiturates or the minor
tranquilizers, but the nature of these differences is unexplored.
</p>

<p>The discussion here centers on barbiturates-the most powerful
and often abused drugs-and brings in others as relevant. </p>

<p><i>Medical Uses.&quot;' </i>The barbiturates are used as
calming agents and as sleeping pills. Some of them are also used
as anticonvulsants in the treatment of certain types of poisoning
or epilepsy. The tranquilizers are used in any situation where
the patient will benefit from an anti-anxiety drug. They are not
sleep-inducing, except insofar as insomnia may be caused by
anxiety. Both are widely used in the practice of medicine. </p>

<p><i>Physical Effects and Toxicity.&quot;' </i>The barbiturates
are general depressants of a wide range of cellular functions in
many organ systems. They are not general anesthetics or
analgesics, however, and will not prevent or relieve pain. (Some
of the ultra-shortacting barbiturates are anesthetics when
injected, but this is a minor exception.) They are respiratory
depressants, and in high concentrations they have direct effects
on the cardiovascular system. Most of the peripheral effects-the
effects directly on the organs themselves-occur only at
concentrations of the drug that exceed those necessary to affect
the CNS and are thus relatively rare. &quot;The CNS is
exquisitely sensitive to the barbiturates, so that, when the
drugs are given in sedative or hypnotic doses, direct actions on
peripheral structures are absent or negligible.&quot;&quot;' The
effect on the CNS can range from coma to mild sedation, depending
on the particular drug, the method of administration, and the
dose. In some individuals, and in some circumstances, low doses
will act as a stimulant rather than a sedative. It is not clear
whether this depends on the mental set of the user or on the
pharmacological phenomenon that the first effect of a drug is
sometimes on brain centers that regulate and inhibit excitatory
bodily functions. </p>

<p>For short- and intermediate-acting barbiturates, the hypnotic
dose is 100-200 mg., which will give six or seven hours of sleep
in the proper environment. The sleep is like physiological sleep,
except that the proportion of REM phase is reduced. (The
amphetamines also reduce REM.) The usual sedative dose is 30-50
mg., given two or three times daily. </p>

<p>The duration of action varies with the particular barbiturate.
Some will last only ten or fifteen minutes, some for more than a
day. Performance degradation, however, may last longer than overt
effects. A 200-mg. dose of secobarbital (which is known as
intermediate in its duration) may cause decreased performance ten
to twenty-two hours later. The aftereffect of the drug may be
hyperexcitability, even though functioning is, in fact, still
impaired. </p>

<p>Taken in large quantities, barbiturates can cause death. The
lethal dose varies, but it can generally be assumed that anything
over ten times the normal hypnotic dose administered at one time
will cause severe poisoning. Moderate poisoning is strikingly
similar to alcoholic intoxication, with slurred speech, poor
reflexes, and the rest of the well-known syndrome. Severe
poisoning is characterized by a deep coma, with respiratory
depression, falling blood pressure, shock syndrome, kidney
failure, and other complications. </p>

<p>The long-term effects of barbiturate use seem to be in some
doubt. The pharmacology books mention only the results of severe
intoxication, not the effects of chronic use. At the same time,
it is known that alcohol and the barbiturates have many
characteristics in common and are to some extent substitutes for
each other. Barbiturates will suppress the withdrawal symptoms of
alcohol and vice versa; the intoxications are similar, and so are
the withdrawal symptoms. In the formal literature, abuse of the
two kinds of drugs is linked as &quot;drug dependence of the
barbiturate-alcohol type.&quot;&quot;' The destructive effects of
long-term heavy alcohol use are familiar, and some authorities
believe that barbiturates may have very similar effects on the
cells of the liver and brain. Presumably, our knowledge of the
toxicity resulting from long-term but moderate use of
barbiturates is in the same limbo as our knowledge of comparable
use of alcohol. </p>

<p><i>Psychoactive Effects. </i>The literature contains numerous
descriptions of the effects of barbiturates on outward behavior.
Intoxication may cause sluggishness, slowness of speech and
comprehension, bad judgment, exaggeration of basic personality
traits, moroseness, or irritability.&quot;' </p>

<p>The sources do not contain a description of the subjective
effects, however, and the nature of the &quot;high&quot; involved
in heavy use is less discussed than is the case for any of the
other drugs of abuse. The general effect seems to be one of
tranquility and peace. How this compares with an opiate high is
not clear. </p>

<p>At doses only slightly in excess of the therapeutic dose, the
effect may be one of excitation and mood elevation rather than of
tranquilization. </p>

<p>A combination of barbiturates and amphetamines produces more
elevation of mood than either taken separately. The reason for
this is not known. Nor is it known whether this is the reason for
the common drug abusers' practice of taking the two in
combination. </p>

<p>The other depressants in this category are abusable and have
much the same effects and symptoms as abused barbiturates. Abuse
in the sense of self-administration does not seem to be terribly
common, however; some of them, such as Librium, have rather
minimal euphoriant effects. In general, from the standpoint of
the abuser, barbiturates-particularly short-acting ones-are a
superior good, with others acceptable as substitutes only if
barbiturates are unavailable. </p>

<p><i>Tolerance. </i>Both drug disposition and pharmacodynamic
tolerance to the barbiturates develop with repeated
administration. The first is caused by the activation of
drug-metabolizing enzymes in the liver and consequent increase in
the speed of detoxation of the drug. A higher dose is then
required to maintain a given tissue concentration. The second
involves the adaptation of nervous tissue to the presence of the
drug. Tolerance develops quickly, and the CNS probably becomes
resistant to the effects of the drug during the action of a
single administration.&quot;' </p>

<p>The tolerance, however, is largely limited to the sedative and
intoxicating effects of the drug. The lethal dose is not much
greater for addicts than for nonaddicts. In addition, the range
of tolerance is narrow. An individual tolerant to 1.2 grams of a
particular drug may show acute intoxication if the dose is raised
as little as 0.1 gram per day. </p>

<p>The other drugs of this class develop tolerance in the same
way and with the same limitations as do the barbiturates. </p>

<p><i>Physical Dependence and Withdrawal. </i>Severe physical
dependence on the barbiturates develops, but, unlike the
situation for the opiates, the dosages required for this effect
are higher than the therapeutic dose. With pentobarbital, for
example, 200 mg. per day can be taken for months without
producing withdrawal, and 400 mg. per day for three months will
produce EEG changes in only 30 per cent of the cases. The other
70 per cent apparently show no effects. After 600 mg. per day for
one to two months, half the subjects will have minor withdrawal
symptoms, and 10 per cent may have a seizure. After continuous,
intoxication with doses of 900 mg. to 2.2 grams, 75 per cent of
the subjects may have seizures, and 60 per cent delirium; all
experience lesser symptoms.&quot;' </p>

<p>Defining &quot;major&quot; withdrawal symptoms as seizures or
psychoses, the time and dosage necessary to produce severe
physical dependence for different sedative hypnotics have been
calculated as follows: ...<br>

<p>* Dosages sufficient to produce &quot;major&quot; withdrawal
signs in humans.<br>
</p>

<p>As Table 1-1 indicates, the other sedative hypnotics are
thought to produce dependence similar to that caused by
barbiturates. They have not been as carefully studied. </p>

<p>We have found no study that divides opiate withdrawal into
major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; symptoms. Thus, it is not
possible to compare the development of barbiturate dependence
with that of opiate dependence. </p>

<p>Once physical dependence develops, withdrawal from
barbiturates is severe, and-unlike opiate withdrawal-may be life
threatening. For one of the short-acting drugs, for the first
twelve hours or so the patient seems to improve as the
intoxication clears. He then becomes restless, anxious,
tremulous, and weak, and sometimes has nausea or cramps. Within
twenty-four hours, he may be too weak to get out of bed,
experience severe tremors in the hands, and have hyperactive deep
reflexes. The peak is reached on the second or third day, and
convulsions may occur. Half the patients who have convulsive
seizures go on to delirium, which occurs between the fourth and
seventh days. This consists of high anxiety, hallucinations, and
disorientation. Once delirium occurs, it may not be suppressed
even by large doses of barbiturates. This is contrary to the
normal course of withdrawal symptoms, which are quickly
suppressed by the drug of addiction. The reason for this anomaly
is not known. During the delirium, exhaustion and cardiovascular
collapse may occur. The withdrawal syndrome usually clears by
about the eighth day, if untreated. For longer-acting drugs,
seizures may not occur until the seventh or eighth day, and the
general course is slowed down accordingly.&quot;' </p>

<p>Hallucinations sometimes persist for months, but &quot;this is
felt by most investigators to be a manifestation of an underlying
psychosis.&quot;&quot;' The sources do not discuss whether
barbiturates, like the opiates, have early and protracted
abstinence syndromes. </p>

<p>Meprobomate (Equanil, Miltown) follows the short-acting
course. Libriurn follows that of the long-acting barbiturates. </p>

<p><i>Mechanisms of Action. </i>More is known about the fate of
barbiturates in the body than is known about the other drugs of
abuse. It is known, for example, that they are transformed by the
liver into a number of inactive metabolites that are in turn
excreted. This lessens the concentration of the drug and causes
the withdrawal from its site of action in the CNS. The general
state of knowledge concerning metabolism, physical
redistribution, and excretion is discussed in the sources, as are
the general theories of sites of action in the CNS. These are too
technical to discuss here. The mechanisms by which barbiturates
operate to cause CNS effects are not well understood.&quot;'<br>

<p><b>A WORD ON ALCOHOL<br>
</b></p>

<p>Problems of alcohol and alcoholism were not within the mandate
of the Drug Abuse Survey Project, and they have not been included
in the report or in any of the supporting papers. In the context
of this chapter, however, one comment should be made: Alcohol is
a drug and could easily be analyzed in the same terms as the
drugs that are covered. It has a potent psychoactive effect and
is, like most of the drugs with which we are concerned, highly
specific to the CNS. Both tolerance and physical dependence
develop, and withdrawal can be a very serious clinical condition.
The drug causes organic damage. The interplay of physiological
factors and psychological factors involves as many uncertainties
for alcohol as for the opiates. </p>

<p>In short, the common distinction between alcohol and
&quot;drugs of abuse&quot; is based on the fact that alcohol is
known and accepted in the culture, not on any pharmacological
considerations. It is entirely possible that alcohol is
inherently more dangerous than most of the other drugs discussed.
</p>

<p>In his listing of the hazards of different drugs, Dr. Samuel
Irwin makes the following rankings, starting with the most
dangerous: ... </p>

<p>1. Glue sniffing </p>

<p>2. Methamphetamine </p>

<p>3. Alcohol </p>

<p>4. Cigarettes </p>

<p>5. Barbiturates and hypnotics </p>

<p>6. Heroin and related narcotics </p>

<p>7. LSD and other hallucinogens </p>

<p>8. Marijuana<br>

<p><b>GOALS OF DRUG EDUCATION</b> </p>

<p>&quot;Prevention through education&quot; has become the newest
panacea of the drug-abuse field. Law enforcement has failed to
stem the supply of illegal drugs, and rehabilitation efforts have
thus far failed to reclaim many abusers. Everyone now talks of
pouring money into education to stop the problem before it
begins. </p>

<p>As of any educational undertaking, the first task of a drug
abuse-prevention program is to define the goals sought. If
objectives are not understood, developing the educational effort
and the techniques to be used is difficult. At present, this is a
major problem of drug education. No one is sure what goals are
realistic or desirable, and proponents of massive efforts cannot
agree on what they hope to accomplish. The most that can be said
is that there are a number of possible objectives for
youth-oriented, drugeducation programs: </p>

<p>Stopping all experimentation with foreign substances </p>

<p>Keeping experimentation at the minimum and limiting it to
relatively safe substances </p>

<p>Preventing casual experimenters from becoming habitual users </p>

<p>Preventing addiction or severe dependence </p>

<p>Reinforcing the anti-experimentation tendencies of those who
have not yet tried drugs </p>

<p>Presenting information for students to use in making drug
decisions for themselves </p>

<p>Increasing student understanding of the complex factors
related to drug use, social attitudes, and policies </p>

<p>For adult audiences, the goals may be somewhat different- for
parents, to give them the best information available, to heighten
their concern about the effects of drugs, to make them less
likely to panic if they find one of their children using drugs,
to encourage them to lobby for more education, treatment, or law
reform, or to teach them to communicate more openly with their
children on the subject. For teachers, counselors, and other
&quot;gatekeepers&quot; the object might be to train them to
create an atmosphere of communication in their classrooms or to
recognize student drug experimenters and abusers, deal with them
sympathetically, and channel them into treatment if necessary.
Teachers might also be equipped with the tools to stimulate
objective discussion of the subject with their students. </p>

<p>The traditional goal of most parents, educators, community
leaders, congressmen, and government officials has been to
discourage young people from experimenting with illegal drugs at
all. In the past, government and privately sponsored education
efforts have tried to do this by emphasizing the horrors of
addiction and lumping all drugs together as leading to the same
ultimate doom. Virtually all experts now agree that such tactics
have not proved effective. Indeed, in many cases, they have been
counterproductive, causing disrespect, skepticism, and resistance
to all advice on drugs. Despite the widespread implementation of
this technique, youthful addiction and experimentation with
illegal drugs have increased. Consequently, within the past few
years there has been a change in emphasis, with more and more
programs concentrating on an honest presentation of accurate,
factual knowledge about the effects of drugs (insofar as such
knowledge is available). The assumption is that drugs are
obviously bad, and that telling the facts will be enough to
convince young people not to experiment. </p>

<p>Although the approach may have changed, the aim of most public
and private antidrug literature remains the same-to discourage
young people from trying marijuana, psychedelics, amphetamines,
barbiturates, and, above all, heroin. The theme of a nationwide
government advertising campaign reflects the traditional
broadside approach: &quot;Why Do You Think They Call It
Dope?&quot; Many of the recent NIMH posters and television spots
are along the same lines: &quot;Will It Turn You On, or Will It
Turn on You?&quot; Most &quot;model&quot; curricula for
elementary, junior, and senior high schools, even when they
present the known facts about drugs fairly, push a strongly
negative attitude toward all commonly abused drugs. The measure
of success of such programs-although few try to measure success
by any formula-is almost always assumed to be total cessation of
drug experimentation and use. </p>

<p>In the late 1960's, however, this viewpoint ran into an
embarrassing problem: no one was able to develop a factual
scientific argument proving that marijuana was harmful. This
development had its greatest impact on programs using the scare
technique, but it also undermined programs based on the premise
that telling the truth was an effective way of discouraging
experimentation. This has put education in a difficult position.
Most drug-education programs are ambivalent. They profess an
honest desire to tell the truth-but only up to a point. When
known facts run out or become controversial, as they almost
certainly do when the subject comes up, the approach reverts to
imposed value judgments, half-truths, or presumptions that the
law is right-devices easily seen through by the skeptical young. </p>

<p>Increasingly, drug experts are coming to the conclusion that
it is the goal that needs to be changed more than the technique,
and that total cessation of all drug experimentation, however
desirable in the abstract, is not a realistic goal for an
education program. Some experts feel strongly that an education
program aimed at stopping drug experimentation of every kind is
bound to fail and so alienate students in the process that they
will not listen to any of it. Drs. Thomas Ungerleider, Norman
Zinberg, and Helen Nowlis, as well as Professor Kenneth
Keniston-to name a few experts-appear to define a different goal
for drug education: to teach youths to make informed decisions
about drugs and indeed about every other kind of chemical
subtance they might ingest. This must include a concentration on
teaching elementary students a fundamental respect for the human.
body and the effects of chemical substances. </p>

<p>Teaching young people to make informed decisions on their own
about illegal drugs is admittedly a more controversial goal than
mechanically urging them to avoid all such drugs. A wholly honest
&quot;tell it like it is&quot; approach may cause a decline in
the use of heroin, amphetamines, and barbiturates, but it will
almost certainly increase the likelihood that youthful listeners
will feel more comfortable about trying marijuana and possibly
some of the milder hallucinogens. Professor Zinberg reports on a
candid talk about drugs to a Massachusetts high school. Before
the lecture, 60 per cent of the students said they would not try
marijuana; after the lecture, the figure dropped to 35 per cent.'
This is not a universal occurrence, of course. For example, a
before-and-after evaluation at a Temple University educational
conference, presenting all points of view, found that attitudes
toward marijuana shifted from favoring legalization to a neutral
position, especially among undergraduates. </p>

<p>A truly factual drug-education program might also influence
attitudes toward commercially advertised and even medically
prescribed drugs. When, for example, people discover that some
legitimate drugs directly cause more deaths annually than do most
abused drugs, they may lose faith in the argument that they
should avoid illegal drugs because there is no official quality
control or pretesting for safety. Another problem with the
factual method involves the source material to be used.
Contradictory statements of &quot;facts&quot; could catalyze a
&quot;your guess is as good as mine&quot; attitude, and this is
an area in which contradictions are common.' Nor are the opinions
of either laymen or experts always based on scientific fact.
Often the opinion comes first and the facts are chosen to fit
it.' An impartial factual approach assumes that an individual
choice will be made on the basis of medical or scientific
evidence regardless of what is forbidden by law. This is a
difficult concept for many to accept, even though some young
people from time immemorial have refused to obey a given law
partly because it is the 'Law or have engaged in -risk-taking
behavior -that appalls adults. Today's climate of individuality
intensifies the likelihood that they will make their own choices
about drugs as well. In some cases, it is precisely the fact that
drugs are illegal and risky that constitutes part of their
attraction. It may be, therefore, that the most useful
educational approach is to give young people the facts upon which
to make that choice, so that they will at least keep their
risk-taking behavior within bounds. Regardless of the educator's
views of what their attitudes should be, effective communication
requires that they be dealt with as they are. One survey of
elementary, junior, and senior high school students in California
concluded that &quot;students feel quite strongly about an
individual's right to make decisions concerning his own use of
drugs.&quot; In the senior high school sampling, 84 per cent of
the users and 76 per cent of the nonusers surveyed responded
positively to the statement &quot;Decision to Use Drugs Is a
Personal Decision.&quot;' </p>

<p>Even if one is willing to accept increased experimentation
with some drugs as the price of decreased damage from other
drugs, there are more serious problems. How, for example, can a
young child be expected to assimilate all the facts about
individual drugs and their effects upon the body and make a
reasonable choice about using them? Experimentation with
ingestion or inhalation of foreign substances is occurring from
age seven on with increasing frequency. How can so young a child
make an informed decision? Might he not lean too heavily on his
emotions, impulses, and peer-group pressure? Clearly, the
&quot;responsible decision&quot; model has its limitations, too. </p>

<p>Other goals for an education program may be identified when
those who are to be educated are involved in the selection
process. It is highly recommended by the U.S. Office of
Education's Drug Education Branch, for example, that young people
share more of the responsibility for specifying objectives. Such
a partnership arrangement tends to enhance the credibility of a
program by &quot;plugging it into&quot; the representative needs
of its target audience. </p>

<p>The unfortunate fact is that we do not know whether an
exclusively factual approach works with the very young, even to
the extent of mitigating the most dangerous kinds of
experimentations. Conversely, we do not know whether a concerted
attempt by schools and media to control the behavior of the
children by propagandizing against drugs and punishing their use
works, either, even if it is justified on the basis that the
child is not old enough to make a rational choice of his own in
so potentially harmful an area. Because of all the problems and
unknowns of the &quot;rational choice&quot; approach, relatively
few programs have adopted it explicitly, even when they concede
the problems of other methods. In general, drug-education
programs at the national, college, high school, and elementary
levels have not faced the difficult issues involved in deciding
among these goals. They have been neither realistic nor frank
with the students or themselves. In most situations, settling on
the goals that are most realistic under the circumstances and
acknowledging those goals to the target group would enhance the
credibility of the drug education program. But even more
importantly, it is necessary to articulate the precise objectives
of any education campaign before it is implemented because they
affect the way in which drug education is taught as well as the
criteria by which its success or failure is evaluated. Until the
precise aims of a program are clear to the sponsor and to the
target population, the methodology cannot be sensitively selected
and the program's effects cannot be accurately assessed. Such a
practice would also allow us to begin to determine which
techniques help to accomplish the objectives and which do not. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>TECHNIQUES OF DRUG EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS</b> </p>

<p>At present, we know almost nothing about how best to reach
students on the drug issue; nor, until recently, have we tried
very hard to find out. Only within the last few years have there
been even rudimentary attempts to evaluate some of the school
programs. Most of the pioneer efforts are very rough, and the
outcomes rarely determine, or even significantly influence, the
planning and allocation of resources. </p>

<p>Although there is now consensus that evaluation is needed, our
lack of knowledge about the effects of existing education
programs is not easily remediable. It is difficult to develop
reliable evaluation techniques for the programs, although many
methods are being tried. In some cases, students are tested
before and after a drug course to see how much of the new
information has been retained. Other surveys use attitudinal
questions about whether participants are more or less willing to
experiment with particular drugs after the program; in still
other cases, selected students are interviewed intensively in an
effort to probe deeply into their attitudes and reactions. Recent
evaluative studies test the effectiveness of several factors
simultaneously by administering varied instruments.
Unfortunately, as Dr. Marvin I. Rosen suggests, existing
&quot;methodologies [are] inadequate for the questions being
asked, and the designs of evaluation studies are inappropriate
for the answers being sought.&quot;' Evaluations are often post
hoc, rather desperate attempts to get information out of a
program that was set up without regard to the need for it. Even
when evaluation is designed into a program, it rarely includes
long-range follow-up to determine the program's effects a year or
more after its termination. </p>

<p>There are other problems. Little of the scant material that
exists on evaluation has been pulled together and published, or
even collected in one place. Valid and interesting work may exist
unknown to almost everyone. In addition, only infrequent use has
been made of the findings of educational-psychology research in
designing learning programs on drug abuse for children of varying
ages, although other areas have attempted to do so. For example,
it is reported that $8 million was spent doing preliminary
research on the psychology of learning before airing the Sesame
Street program, which teaches reading concepts to preschool
children. </p>

<p>Finally, there are institutional obstacles, and dedication to
evaluation is often more froth than reality. The primary concern
of many evaluators is that something be done, and they take a
subjective view of the quality of the effort. Program staffs fear
that objective study of their efforts will place future
activities in jeopardy or believe that they are performing a
service that cannot be measured. Some educators feel that
evaluation produces only statistical data, which they equate with
antihumanism. Program personnel often fail to specify their goals
and the means utilized to attain them. </p>

<p>Dr. Helen Nowlis pointed out in 1967 that &quot;at the present
time there is no standard or widely accepted model for planning
an effective drug-education program. This is an area that
urgently needs research, development and demonstration.&quot;'
This statement is still appropriate several years later. The
underpinnings for a rational drug-education approach do not exist
at the present time. Pronouncements abound on the kinds of
programs that should be undertaken, and model curricula are easy
to find, but hard data on the effect such programs have on
students are virtually nonexistent. Given this situation, the two
major priorities in this field are: (1) Well-designed and tested
evaluation techniques to measure the attainment of specific goals
(once they have been defined) in any school drug-education
program. Different evaluative models would measure different
goals-e.g., decreasing drug use, more information dissemination
among the student body, substitution of less harmful drugs,
rational drug use, less use in school, fewer acute health crises,
more referrals of students to treatment, more use made of school
personnel by students for advice. (2) A formal 'compilation of
what evaluation data exist, which programs have been evaluated,
what criteria have been used, and what results have been
obtained. This information should be widely disseminated to
members of the educational community as well as to those involved
in drug programming (treatment, rehabilitation, intervention). </p>

<p>In the absence of this kind of information, we can only turn
to the opinions of recognized &quot;experts&quot; in the field,
without any real assurance, however, that they are right. Yet,
there appears to be consensus (at least for the present) on the
following points: </p>

<p>The common pattern of having physical education or health
teachers set aside one unit in the curriculum to lecture on the
dangers of drugs is virtually useless. See, e.g., the Report of
the Mayor's Task Force on Drug Abuse Education in Washington,
D.C.: &quot;To this date, most current crisis-oriented programs
cater to the biases of adults, and depend on the faulty theory of
emphasizing information or lecture techniques.&quot; </p>

<p>A program must be ongoing, with the opportunity for recurrent
discussions throughout the year. Even some of the new,
well-motivated programs suffer from a &quot;crisis&quot;
approach. An evaluation of programs conducted in four high school
classes showed that &quot;short-term programs, even though very
sophisticated and intensive, may have little impact on the
attitudes of students regarding the abuse of drugs.&quot; The
study concludes that &quot;the primary value of [the] project is
that it adds a note of caution to those who would set aside a
single day for drug education and be satisfied with the
results.&quot;' Although countless &quot;one-shot&quot; programs
are sponsored nationally, there is little evidence that such
programs have any lasting effect. </p>

<p>Different approaches have to be taken for students of
different ages, cultural backgrounds, and levels of drug
sophistication. The subtle variations among particular
subcultures must be recognized. Drug education of some general
kind needs to begin in kindergarten, or even earlier, and should
focus on the specific drugs of abuse by fourth or fifth grade.
The program for teenage suburban experimenters with marijuana
must be different from the program for ghetto heroin users. Each
target group must be studied to determine what kind of message
will reach it. The information must then be structured so that it
relates closely to the students' sophistication and willingness
to identify with the subject matter. </p>

<p>There must be open and free dialogue between students and the
teacher or discussion leader in an atmosphere of tolerance for
all points of view, free of moralizing and shock reactions. </p>

<p>Use should be made of the comments and experiences of
youngsters who have actually used drugs, with confidentiality
assured. </p>

<p>From junior high school on, students should be involved in
planning and implementing the drug-education program to assure
its relevance to the specific situation in that school. Again,
the students' level of sophistication must be accurately
assessed. Predetermined curricula are to be avoided unless they
are clearly relevant. </p>

<p>Factual material must be absolutely accurate and honest. Where
research does not yet provide clear answers, this must be
admitted. Tobacco and alcohol abuse should be treated along with
illicit drugs as part of the same over-all problem. The dangers
as well as the benefits of legitimate drug use must be frankly
acknowledged where they exist. </p>

<p>The curriculum should not be a passive one, relying solely on
pamphlets, lectures, or films. There should be an emphasis on
actual experimental data that let the students see the underlying
methodology of drug research and the way conclusions are reached.
Where possible, students should view actual experimentation with
the effects of drugs on animals and, at higher grade levels,
conduct these experiments themselves. In Dr. Louise Richards'
view: &quot;The expectation is that deeper understanding of the
CNS [central nervous system] and effects of psychoactive drugs
will result in more profound respect for the hazards of
unsupervised use.&quot;' </p>

<p>Emphasis should be placed on the motivational aspects of drug
use-why people use drugs, what they hope to accomplish and what
they hope to escape, and how they can fulfill these needs in
other ways. Interviews with high school students in California
reveal a strong dislike for repetitive programs focusing on
information alone. The students greatly preferred continuing
discussions on the reasons for drug use.&quot; Again, this is a
way of actively involving the student in the learning process and
making it a two-way engagement. Equal emphasis should be given to
the reasons people do not want to take drugs. Dr. Helen Nowlis
points out that college students often seem less interested in
the legal and medical facts about drugs than in a personal,
philosophical discussion about the limits on an individual's
right to self-discovery and expression.&quot; </p>

<p>Education of any kind will have little or no impact on a
youngster who is already deeply involved with drugs. A survey of
students in nine high schools concluded that &quot;students who
have used drugs are not likely to be favorably impressed or to be
changed by viewing ... drug abuse films. In all nine schools the
pattern was the same: the students, after viewing the films, said
they were likely to continue their behavior as users or nonusers
of drugs.&quot;&quot; </p>

<p>Alternative behavior patterns should be provided, for many
users frequently give up drugs for something else. The
&quot;something else&quot; varies but frequently takes the form
of intense personal experiences, often of a religious nature,
deep interpersonal experiences through the use of transcendental
meditation or yoga, participation in sensitivity groups, or
free-school activities. (See Staff Paper 6, below.) Such
alternative programs, in order to be effective, should be
attractive, easily available on a continuing basis, and organized
with advice from the student body. </p>

<p>Given this consensus, however, a fundamental dispute still
exists over whether the purely factual approach to drugs is more
harmful than helpful to young &quot;risk takers.&quot; Some
experts believe that giving specific factual knowledge reinforces
the antidrug propensities of persons not likely to abuse drugs
anyway but actually contributes to the &quot;seduction&quot; of
vulnerable high-risk groups by romanticizing the negativism that
motivates their conduct.&quot; Movies, media advertising, rock
music, underground newspapers, and commercial films that excite
interest in specific drug use transmit the nonverbal message that
users get attention and sympathy. Dr. Paul Blachley espouses a
different kind of education, focusing on underlying behavioral
responses and on why people consciously hurt themselves and those
around them. He would convey the over-all image of the
drug-abuser as a boring, weak-minded, easily &quot;conned&quot;
individual, not as a daring and reckless adventurer. But the
student survey quoted above concluded that none of the six drug
films examined lured anyone into trying drugs who had not already
done so. </p>

<p>Other studies highlight the need for additional investigation
into the effects of drug education.&quot; Studies by Gilbert Geis
(1969) and the California Department of Education (1970)
determined that short-term programs (four weeks or less)
significantly increased student knowledge about drugs and caused
more cautious attitudes toward drug use. However, several studies
conducted at the Pennsylvania State University in 1970-71
&quot;showed consistent relationships between better knowledge
about drugs and pro-drug attitudes; better knowledge and the use
of marijuana; and pro-drug attitudes and the use of
marijuana.&quot;&quot; </p>

<p>A still unsettled question is whether drug education should be
integrated into a &quot;life-problem&quot; course that includes
such other subjects as sex and relations with parents and peers.
Dr. Norman Zinberg, for one, espouses the integrated model. There
also appears to be pressure toward this broader model from many
students. Even courses labeled &quot;drug education&quot; very
often take a motivational approach that examines underlying
values and behavioral problems. A comparison of eighth- and
eleventh graders in California revealed that users know less
about drugs and drug-related information than nonusers at the
same grade level. The study concluded: &quot;While the continued
teaching of factual drug information might somewhat lessen
student drug use, it could not do the job by itself, but when
combined with an affective or attitudinal approach could be of
real effect.&quot;&quot; The Coronado Unified School District
consequently led other schools in stressing the need for a
comprehensive program covering values, valuing processes
(decision-making), value orientations, and their possible effects
on human behavior. Advocates of this approach recommend its use
with parents, teachers, and students to increase mutual
understanding and the ability to cope with the problems of
everyday life. </p>

<p>Another fundamental question, especially for schools, is who
should do the drug educating. Are regular teachers or
knowledgeable outsiders more effective? All experts stress that
it must be someone the students like and trust, someone who knows
and will present the facts accurately and who feels comfortable
and free in open discussion. Few teachers in any school fit that
description. It has been observed by some outside speakers that
students' questions dramatically increased in sophistication when
the teacher left the room. In Washington, D.C., the mayor's task
force suggested selecting teachers for drug education on the
basis of a &quot;sociogram&quot; asking students to state
anonymously to whom they would go for consultation or advice on
personal problems. On the other side, several reports and
interviews have warned about the possibly insidious effect of
teachers who themselves actually promote drug use, wittingly or
unwittingly. </p>

<p>Perhaps because of the more personal level of communication
encouraged in primary grades, elementary students stand alone in
preferring the teacher as a source of information. When surveyed,
high school students usually prefer ex-addicts and medical
doctors as resource people. Ex-users were considered qualified
because of their firsthand experience with drugs. Conversely,
doctors were seen as authorities on drug effects but lost
credibility when discussing the &quot;feelings&quot; drugs
produce. Dr. Thomas Ungerleider, of UCLA, reports that, in his
experience, the most successful approach for a medical lecturer
begins with an assurance to the students that he is not there for
the purpose of persuading them to stay off drugs and does not
represent law enforcement, parents, or school authorities, but is
there only to tell them the known facts about drugs and the human
body and to answer their questions. </p>

<p>Any discussion leader must be able to validate his credentials
by showing the students that he knows the facts he states are
true. Many schools have drug-education and rehabilitation centers
run by, or with the help of, former drug users who present
programs consisting of small student group discussions. These are
often supplemented by discussions with faculty and parent groups
as well. PLACE, in Boston, is an example of a drug-information
and service center for hippies, runaways, and drug users, staffed
by graduate students and run by the youthful clients with
professional supervision. They conduct programs for local
schools. </p>

<p>The role of the ex-addict in school programs deserves special
consideration. He is the current fad of drug education, on the
theory that only one who has been there can tell about it
convincingly. There is some truth to this, but apparently
different children receive different messages. The ex-addict is
perceived by some as a self-promoter capitalizing on his drug
experience for admiration or profit. Others get the idea that it
is as easy to get off drugs as it is to get addicted, so that
there is little risk in trying them. A ghetto youth might well
surmise that, if the ex-addict had never become addicted to
heroin in the first place, he would be worse off, probably
jobless, and without the attention and respect he is now
receiving. To some, the ex-addict is a glamorous
&quot;anti-hero&quot; somewhat like a rock singer. In one
California high school, ex-addict visitors were the recipients of
phone calls from girl students seeking after school dates.
Several schools have had unfortunate experiences with ex-addicts
who are not really &quot;ex&quot; and are either pushing or using
drugs. Others are akin to religious converts, uttering rigid
opinions about all drugs, including marijuana, and denigrating
all treatment modalities other than their own. Still others turn
out never to have been serious users at all but are merely
well-versed in the jargon of the users. Reportedly, some
out-of-work rock musicians earn extra money making the school
circuit. And, disturbingly, large numbers of ex-addicts reminisce
about the actual &quot;high&quot; with an exquisite affection not
lost on their young audiences. Some ex-addicts, although off
drugs, are currently abusing alcohol. Others are prey to the same
myths about drugs as nonusers and pass misinformation on to
students. </p>

<p>All this gives the negative side of using ex-addicts, a
practice that is sometimes accepted too uncritically. But this is
not the only side. Ex-addicts can be excellent teachers, able to
speak with credibility and to relate to youngsters, although the
mere fact that they are ex-addicts does not ensure rapport. One
of the very few carefully evaluated school programs showed, for
example, that, while students liked to hear ex-addicts tell of
their experiences, they did not give them so much credence when
they lectured about drugs generally.&quot; Ex-addicts with
natural talent in relating to the young and with some training in
sensitivity and substance may make very good drug-education
teachers, indeed, and their experience may give them extra
effectiveness. A good educator who happens to be an ex-addict may
have a special and valuable feeling for the factors that lead
youths to try drugs. </p>

<p>In ghetto schools, antidrug black-militant organizations often
have a special appeal. The ghetto youngster's need for a role
model may focus on such a symbol of racial pride. Organizations
such as Blackman's Development Center and PRIDE, Inc., in
Washington, D.C., have recently entered the drug education field
and vigorously propagandize against drugs in schools, sometimes
with homemade slides of addiction horrors and appeals to racial
unity against a &quot;white man's&quot; scourge. How successful
they will be remains to be seen. </p>

<p>The difficulty with most school education programs run by
&quot;outsiders&quot; is that they lack continuity in the school
itself. The ex-addicts, the graduate students, and visiting
doctors come and go, while the students' need for information or
help may continue for months. One of the more promising
approaches is that used by a San lose high school, which released
a popular young teacher for several months to learn the drug
scene intimately by going on &quot;buys&quot; with local police,
attending court trials, working with doctors in drug clinics,
interviewing patients at treatment centers, and spending time on
the streets and in criminology labs. On his return, he took on
(apparently successfully) the combined duties of teacher and
counselor to students with drug problems.&quot; </p>

<p>Dissatisfied with past results, many school systems this year
are trying a variety of new preventive-education methods to
discourage drug abuse, involving more direction by the students
themselves. The New York City Board of Education has announced a
trial program in sixteen high schools in which pupils will design
and run their own antidrug programs. In Philadelphia last year,
selected students from seven high schools (accompanied by a
teacher) learned basic drug facts from doctors, treatment
experts, and law-enforcement officials and went on field trips.
They then went back to their own schools to initiate and run
programs of their own choice. Most of them opened counseling
services. With regard to peer involvement, there are indications
that students should be given a voice in basic approach,
curriculum content, and choice of teachers but should not be
saddled with administrative chores, which they abhor and often
perform poorly. Nevertheless, tapping the enthusiasm of
well-selected students can be beneficial in motivating the
student body to seek creative antidrug activities. </p>

<p>The notion that young people relate to their peers better than
to adults has validity but also limits. They relate only to some
of their peers. Rigid social groups exist in many schools, and
students chosen by teachers and school officials may not be the
ones to lead the group that the antidrug program hopes most to
reach. Whenever possible, some student participation in planning
and operating programs should come from the group the program is
trying to reach, whether nonusers, experimenters, or borderline
cases. The student council in an Oregon high school sought the
cooperation of ex-users and faculty in creating a youthful
&quot;Mod Squad.&quot; Teams of experienced students provided
successful peer counseling, assistance in crisis situations, and
referrals to local treatment facilities and otherwise contributed
positively to the school's educational programming. </p>

<p>There is also the &quot;role model&quot; theory that younger
children, between the ages of seven and twelve, will learn from
and relate better to older youth than to children their own age
or adults. &quot;Dope Stop&quot; in Arizona uses high school
students, trained by physicians, psychiatrists, or ex-addicts, to
counsel grades five to eight. One proposal suggests subsidizing
teenaged youth with a reputation for being &quot;in&quot; and
&quot;cool&quot; to work with younger boys against drug
involvement. NIMH drug-information officials say they are also
considering having students of different age groups prepare
education programs for the next-youngest age level. </p>

<p>A study of a junior high school drug-education program that
featured teachers and ex-addicts produced some illuminating
results. The program lasted an entire semester in two junior high
schools in the high narcotics area of the inner city, and
questionnaires were administered before and after the program as
well as in a control school using the traditional lecture method.
The results showed that teachers and ex-addicts were hostile
toward one another, resenting each other's prerogatives and
roles. Teachers resented the time spent on testing for
evaluation, and ex-addicts needed feedback on how the students
reacted toward them. The students in the experimental schools did
better on factual knowledge than those in the control schools.
Parent education efforts failed. The students thought the films
were &quot;no good&quot; and exaggerated the behavior of drug
users, and that the reading material was &quot;cut and
dried.&quot; They wanted more talking and less reading; also, to
hear the ex-addicts relate personal experiences but not to
lecture. The students did not like the personal questions on the
tests and were suspicious that their answers would not be kept
confidential. They wanted more concentration on the drugs used in
their own schools; they wanted to see samples of the drugs in
order to recognize them. </p>

<p>Discouragingly, however, there is no evidence that most of the
new programs being undertaken will be evaluated any more
systematically than the older ones have been. Until that happens,
therefore, we will not know the best way to educate about drug
abuse. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>TOTAL SCHOOL INVOLVEMENT</b> </p>

<p>Once again, as has happened so often with complex social
dilemmas, the schools have inherited America's number-one
&quot;Problem cbild'-the drug-abuse crisis. At present, educators
are joining with related disciplines in defining approaches to
the problem for use in classrooms, libraries, and counseling
offices. Educational institutions have become the testing ground
for diverse preventive alternatives. It has become clear that the
fundamental areas of school involvement must be to provide
relevant educational programs from kindergarten through college
and to serve as an avenue for community action involving
students, parents, faculty, and other local elements. </p>

<p>According to the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs: </p>

<p>The schools cannot by themselves be expected to rehabilitate
youth and their neighborhood environments. Sociologists and
others who have worked in the drug abuse prevention field have
pointed out that drug education is not a problem for the schools
alone. It is a community problem and requires total community
effort for its solution. The schools cannot assume the roles of
parents, clergymen, enforcement officers, physicians or
psychiatrists. But they can exercise leadership in facing a
problem that the total community, working together, can try to
remedy. This is education in its broadest and most important
sense. It is making schools relevant to their communities. </p>

<p>An initial effort must be made to formulate school policies
that are sensitive to the needs of all elements of the school
community. There is no point, for example, in expecting
&quot;free&quot; class discussions or adult cooperation when
student informers are widely used throughout the school and
teachers are required to report all suspected users to the
police. If the school intends to act as an extension of civil
authority-to investigate and turn users over to the police-it
must come to terms with the fact that its effectiveness as an
educational force will be substantially reduced. On the other
hand, no school administrator can be expected to sit idly by
while drug traffic flourishes within the school. Therefore, a
major responsibility of school authorities is to give careful
consideration to alternative choices in defining the school's
action policy toward drug use. Once established, the policy
should be clearly explained to students and their parents, as
well as to the school staff. The failure of school administrators
to communicate with students about policies that they will be
expected to obey inevitably creates mistrust of all official
advice and information. By seeking and accepting inputs from
young people and their parents in the formulation of school
policies, school officials not only open up valuable channels of
communication but make it possible to develop policies that are
relevant to the needs, interests, and aspirations of each member
of the school community. </p>

<p>Until recently, schools could do little to deter student use
of drugs, because most of them had no announced policy. More and
more, administrators are moving to establish such guidelines, for
a very good reason: Lacking established policy guidelines, a
school has no standard procedure for providing help or discipline
when a student is found with drugs. A variety of policies is
possible, and it is difficult to say in advance how much
effectiveness in one area should be traded for gains in another.
Some colleges say that what the student does with his own body is
his own business, unless it results in active disruption of
classes, threatens the safety of others, or prevents satisfactory
academic functioning. This laissez-faire policy, however, is less
likely to be acceptable at the high school level. Some schools
have opted for the policy that selling or distributing drugs is
forbidden, and that distributors will be punished while users
will be treated more leniently or ignored. Other schools refuse
to initiate disciplinary action for anything that happens off
school grounds. More cautious institutions have adopted the
theory that drug use spreads in epidemic fashion, and that it is
necessary to quarantine and isolate the carrier. They
aggressively seek out drug users through urinalysis or locker
searches and either expel the users or report them to
law-enforcement officials. Some recent court decisions have made
it difficult for school personnel to conduct searches of a
student's personal belongings, thus imposing limitations on what
a school can do to investigate possible drug dealing. </p>

<p>The optimal relationship between school policy and the law
enforcement system is difficult to determine. Some schools have
worked out cooperative agreements with law-enforcement agencies
in seeking feasible alternatives to arrest (which is viewed as a
last resort). Unfortunately, however, most school officials have
given little thought to methods of diverting student drug
possessors who need help out of the criminal process and into
treatment, as witness a booklet published by the National
Association of Secondary School Principals in 1969: </p>

<p>There is a distorted notion gaining widespread acceptance that
a school or college is a sanctuary. These institutions are a part
of society and are subject to the same laws as the rest of
society. Accordingly, the school authorities have the same
responsibility as every other citizen to report violations of
law. Students possessing or using on school premises drugs
prohibited by law should be reported to the appropriate law
enforcement officials .20 </p>

<p>John Langer, of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs,
advises principals to use discretion and judgment in situations
that may involve the violation of federal, state, or local laws.
He emphasizes that teachers and administrators are not
law-enforcement officers but school officials with a
responsibility to carry out school board policy.&quot; </p>

<p>Continuing lines of communication between law-enforcement
agencies and schools (such as the involvement of policemen in
teacher-training and community educational efforts, speakers'
bureaus, and community-relations programs) are often mutually
beneficial in dealing with drug issues. In several metropolitan
areas, these efforts have led to the establishment of counseling
sessions that must be attended by first offenders and their
parents in lieu of a jail sentence. A Hudson Institute study has
suggested specially supervised &quot;drug-free&quot; schools for
all students found to be using drugs. Opponents of this approach,
however, argue that isolation and expulsion will only confirm the
occasional user's alienation and result in his further
identification with deviant behavior. </p>

<p>Students frequently cited the need for a designated person in
the schools to whom they can go for information or help, assured
that their confidence will be kept. Helen Nowlis states,
&quot;Within any institution it should be made clear who will and
can guarantee confidentiality and such guarantees should be
respected.&quot;&quot; Such a person would be an
ombudsman-counselor, able to work with parents as well as
students to solve drug problems. He must be the kind of person
students normally seek out for sympathetic but sound advice. In
addition, he should have thorough familiarity with the drug-abuse
field as well as access to treatment and intervention programs,
so that he can provide referrals in acute situations. (There is
reason to believe that this type of counseling resource can be
more important for schools than traditional educational
programs.) Such a person could also advise the school on general
policies and provide drug-usage information. His expertise would
be invaluable in conducting drug-abuse education classes. </p>

<p>The ombudsman concept must be carefully considered by the
schools. Their wholehearted commitment must be assured, for
nothing could be so damaging as to invite confidences and then
not to be able to honor them. The legal problems raised when a
school official acts in the counselor's role must also be
resolved and cooperation obtained from the authorities to prevent
pressure on individuals who may not enjoy a technical legal
privilege. Because school policies frequently forbid teachers to
honor student confidences, many are hesitant to encourage
personal involvement, which may place the student in jeopardy. </p>

<p>Many believe that the ombudsman-counselor should provide his
services for other kinds of adolescent problems in addition to
those related to drugs-family, sex, alcohol, and so on.&quot;
Classroom teachers often have tremendous influence on students,
especially on those who lack parental understanding. They occupy
a more neutral position than parents and sometimes are better
able to identify behavior requiring special counseling or
referral. </p>

<p>Until now, schools have relied almost entirely on classroom
teachers to assist student drug abusers in finding help. Public
funds earmarked for &quot;teacher training courses&quot; have
rarely included guidance-counseling personnel. It is unfortunate
that schools have failed to take advantage of the position of
those guidance counselors who enjoy the trust and respect of
young people. Recently, the American Personnel and Guidance
Association began developing a national effort to train guidance
workers to deal with the complexities of drug abuse. The program
is being held in abeyance until adequate seed money can be
procured. </p>

<p>Information alone cannot always help a youthful user. The head
of a Mexican-American outreach program in Los Angeles testified
before Congress that a large proportion of youth in his area were
heavily addicted to barbiturates, but that education could not
help when there was no place in the area they could go for
medical aid in withdrawal. Teacher and guidance counselors should
provide the link between the school and treatment resources that
is now lacking in many places. If it is to reach users or
experimenters, a school education program not only must supply
information on where to go for help but also must have an
effective system for getting them there. Teachers or counselors
must know, for example, whether the student-user can receive
treatment on his own (as in California and Connecticut) or must
have parental permission before anyone can treat him (as in most
other states). School counselors should be willing to take the
initiative in getting the student to the treatment service and in
running bureaucratic interference for him. They may even have to
help make parents more sensitive to their children's drug problem
in an effort to prevent them from acting destructively. </p>

<p>On the other hand, treatment facilities in many areas far
outnumber institutions that focus on prevention. Young people who
do not use drugs have legitimate questions but find few places to
which they can turn for answers. The school counselor can act as
an effective source of information. </p>

<p>Any well-balanced school program should harness the support
and cooperation of outside community elements in providing help
to young abusers. The Office of Education's national teacher
training program challenged schools to consider community
motivation as their ultimate long-range goal. OE staff members
report that teachers were often unsuccessful in gaining the
necessary support of politicians, school board members,
principals, and parents in accomplishing this final phase of
their program. As a rule, the attitudes of the communities
precluded the exploration of innovative ways to prevent drug
abuse. What is needed, therefore, is widespread local awareness
of the need for unity in making progress-a recognition that
educational institutions are merely conduits through which
communal efforts must pass. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>OUT-OF-SCHOOL DRUG-EDUCATION PROGRAMS</b> </p>

<p>Education does not take place only in school. As Helen Nowlis
stated before Congress: </p>

<p>It is learning about drugs that should concern us today,
rather than the formal mechanisms for presenting drug
information. Information by itself is not education, education by
itself is not learning. </p>

<p>How do people, particularly young people, learn about drugs
and form their drug-related attitudes? We believe that a series
of influences help shape these attitudes: the atmosphere of the
school, as well as the factual information presented there; the
life-style at home, and the attitude of parents; peer-group
pressures; popular culture, including music, films, magazines and
nationally publicized events; personal experiences with drugs or
drug-related substances; the availability of alternative
mechanisms for carrying out certain kinds of behavior-risk
taking, wish fulfillment, etc .24 </p>

<p>Most of a youth's initial information about a subject comes
from his peers. A survey of Maryland high school students showed
that they got most of their drug information and attitudes from
peers and underground newspapers. In addition, the students most
prone to serious drug abuse are often those who are most
antagonistic to the school climate. There is general agreement
that more out-of-school programs are needed to reach those whom
the schools cannot reach. Unfortunately, antidrug programs run by
private and public organizations outside the school are of
varying quality and totally lacking in evaluation. Nevertheless,
the New York Addiction Control Commission alone spent $1 million
in 1970 on such &quot;preventive education.&quot; </p>

<p>Most prevention programs, besides lacking evaluation, are not
grounded on any hypotheses based on field observations. Dr.
Irving Lukoff, of the Columbia University School of Social Work,
believes that effective prevention programs await basic research
to discover what influences young people in heavily addicted
areas not to take drugs, why some do use drugs, and how drug use
spreads. </p>

<p>The most that can be done at this point is to categorize five
basic kinds of nonschool prevention programs: </p>

<hr>

<p><b>PEER-GROUP PROGRAMS</b> </p>

<p>Many types of teenage peer-group, antidrug programs have
emerged. The following are illustrative: </p>

<p>The members of one national group-the Smarteens-pledge not to
use drugs, wear buttons deriding drug use, and distribute posters
scorning the drug culture. The psychology is to provide support
and reinforcement for youngsters who choose not to use drugs.
Such a technique, however, merely widens the gap between the
&quot;squares&quot; and the drug users and alienates the latter
still further. Those familiar with the group admit it has its
greatest impact in middle-class suburban areas. </p>

<p>Members of Project DARE (Drug Abuse Research and Evaluation),
in the Los Angeles area, do not use drugs, but participate in the
rest of the psychedelic scene-rock music, flashy dress, crafts-so
as to show that one can be &quot;cool&quot; without being
drugged. Other activities include evaluating drug education
films, lecturing to encourage an understanding of today's drug
culture, and stimulating the involvement of youth in the solution
of community problems. </p>

<p>Two New York City ghetto high schools have experimented with a
program in which members of a black youth organization visit the
schools, assess the drug situation, and then
&quot;penetrate&quot; by mixing at the ball courts and other
student gathering places, seeking to identify student pushers and
deal with them, either through persuasion or by reporting them to
the authorities. Identified users are urged to seek treatment.
The organization itself reports a reduction in selling and usage
of drugs, but no official evaluation is obtainable. </p>

<p>Teen Challenge is a private, religion-oriented agency with
centers across the country that offer treatment to anyone over
eighteen. Its premise is that a drug user should be given an
opportunity to undergo a religious experience that can give him
the strength to overcome his destructive desires and habits. </p>

<p>Private businesses often fund programs offering alternatives
to youth. One recently financed a project involving youth groups
from Harlem and Nassau County, utilizing peer-group dynamics as
an alternative to drug abuse. Films, magazines, and educational
materials created by the students are disseminated to schools and
community organizations. </p>

<p>Several treatment and rehabilitation facilities have opened
their doors to youngsters for whom they organize extracurricular
activities. Patients in a Detroit methadone facility have
&quot;hit the streets&quot; to provide speakers, peer and family
counseling, and neighborhood projects to stimulate political
awareness and consumer education. RAP, Inc., a Washington, D.C.,
therapeutic community, encourages neighborhood children to join a
&quot;block club&quot; designed to channel energies
constructively. Tutoring services, speakers, and library
privileges are extended to members of the group. </p>

<p>Some of the more creative programs involve both drug
experimenters and nonusers in activities that seek to explore
ways youth can pursue inward and outward experiences that will
make drug use less desirable. Dr. William Soskin's Project
Community in Berkeley has such a program for 140 youths between
the ages of fourteen and eighteen. Acting on the hypothesis that
home and school have not provided sufficiently satisfying
influences in their lives, the Center seeks to create a
&quot;third force&quot; consisting of a group of peers, under
supervision, who engage in mutual activities a few hours a day.
These activities include inward meditation, body language,
poetry, and even active practical jokes for the more aggressive
members. Rap sessions and encounter groups as well as active
community projects and recreation outings complete the program.
Sympathetic counselors are always available to talk to an
individual about his problems. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>FREE CLINICS AND CRISIS CENTERS</b> </p>

<p>There are a number of free medical clinics for &quot;street
people&quot; providing a range of services on a twenty-four-hour
basis-not only emergency medical or psychological help for drug
crises (bad trips and severe reactions), but also up-to-date
information on the quality and effects of drugs currently being
sold in the immediate area, long-term treatment, and referral.
Their basic purpose is not to proselytize against drugs but to
provide help when people need it most and to disseminate accurate
analyses of the risks of street drugs. In some cases, for
example, there followed a dramatic decrease in the use of
particular drugs or batches of drugs after the clinic staff
spread the word that a particular product was having bad effects
.2' Free medical clinics reach those in or on the edge of the
drug culture, and they enjoy a high degree of credibility. Most
crisis centers cater to a variety of needs, including draft,
abortion, and family counseling. These facilities sometimes offer
temporary residence for runaways and intervention with parents.
Usually, they give medical help to those with drug problems and
provide speakers and materials as well as information to other
community organizations, including schools. Some even provide
employment in crafts and work with delinquent youngsters in the
community. </p>

<p>Most clinics and crisis centers are run by the youths
themselves with professional and medical guidance. Young people
are attracted by their neutral attitude toward drug use. What
preventive effects, if any, the centers have on continued drug
use is extremely speculative, but they fill acute needs for help
in immediate health crises and for accurate information. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>&quot;HOT-LINE&quot; TELEPHONE SERVICES</b> </p>

<p>Anyone can call such a telephone service anonymously with
questions about drug reactions as well as a score of other
problems. Not infrequently, hot-line staffers are asked to locate
lost pets, give advice on domestic squabbles, and make referrals.
It is inherent in the nature of such a service that there is no
way of telling what happens to callers, or whether they make use
of the advice and information given about drugs and treatment
services, or whether, indeed, calls are legitimate. Anonymity
constitutes the service's main attraction. Ex-users often find
positive reinforcement and satisfaction in serving as hot-line
operators. Yet, there are cases where constantly talking about
drug effects has led these people back to drug use. As a rule,
however, their past drug experiences enhance their ability to
deal effectively with crisis situations. In cases of extreme
emergency, trained professionals are consulted. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>AFTERSCHOOL AND INSTEAD-OF-SCHOOL PREVENTION PROGRAMS</b> </p>

<p>As of 1970, New York City's Addiction Services Agency ran
sixteen youth centers in poverty areas to discourage drug use by
nonusers or early experimenters aged nine to nineteen and
referred by parents, schools, police, or courts. Ten centers were
funded by OEO, four by NIMH, but all were to be shifted to local
and state funding. ASA was asking for money to open four more
centers in middle-class neighborhoods. </p>

<p>ASA has estimated that 80 per cent of New York City youths
over twelve have experimented with at least one drug. The
majority, however, reportedly have no deep-seated mental problems
requiring a residential therapeutic community setting. During
1970, about 500 youths were in such afterschool centers at any
one time and some 5,440 in all were served. </p>

<p>The focus is on group therapy and counseling to help the youth
make basic decisions about his values and life goals.
&quot;Disrupters,&quot; seriously disturbed youth, and heavy
opiate users are not eligible. Parent groups also operate out of
the centers, which try to work with the schools, so that teachers
too can play a supportive role. </p>

<p>Centers are open five days a week, each handling 50 youths at
a time. Youths, if attending school, come to the center in the
afternoons, generally for a period of three to six months. If
they are not in school, center activities are scheduled during
the day. Peer-group sessions, role-playing and psychodrama,
individual counseling, recreation, workshops, and seminars are
all used. An attempt is made to establish role-model
identification with staff members. </p>

<p>These centers have not, to our knowledge, been evaluated
systematically. Their aim is to create pressure against the use
of drugs. The agency's own assessment is that the centers have
had difficulty because the youths referred to them need more
supportive services than can be offered. </p>

<p>There have been recurrent proposals for outdoor work or summer
camps for drug-using youngsters. ASA would like to create one for
150-180 youths aged twelve to nineteen, modeled on Outward Bound.
(This is a program that gets youth into the country, where they
increase their wilderness skills in challenging situations, thus
increasing their sense of confidence and selfworth.)
Group-encounter sessions would be combined with regular camp
life. Dr. Gordon Heistad, of the University of Minnesota, has
experimented (successfully, he believes) with a camp model
combining drug education and regular camp life for high school
leaders. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>DRUGMOBILES</b> </p>

<p>These vehicles, which follow street youth into their natural
haunts, to ball games and rock concerts, have been tried in
several cities. Generally, they feature informational exhibits
and ex-addict staffers. Counselors answer inquiries on an
individual basis and ensure anonymity. </p>

<p>Credible staff is quite difficult to retain, since trained
counselors prefer working with more stable programs. In most
cases, these mobile units end up having middle-aged discussion
leaders with good intentions but little facility in
communicating. Many young people suggest that more emphasis
should be put on honest discussions and less on
&quot;clever&quot; exhibits. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>THE NATIONAL MEDIA</b> </p>

<p>A perpetual dispute in the drug-education field involves the
influence of the national media on drug-abuse-prevention efforts.
What effect do they have? What effect should they have? Some who
work with young drug users believe that television is more likely
to influence them than school programs, because they relate more
sympathetically to the medium; others fear that a high powered
television campaign stressing &quot;risks, thrills, scares,
fantasies, high tragedy and antiheroism&quot; will increase drug
experimentation.&quot; Dr. Norman Zinberg points out that
television may bend growing children in the direction of seeking
experiences that transcend tangible boundaries, such as
mind-altering drugs.&quot; </p>

<p>The role played by the mass media in any comprehensive drug
education effort depends on the specific objectives of that
effort and the methods used to attain them. The current lack of
agreement on these matters, however, makes it difficult to
conceive of the ideal media program and virtually impossible to
predict the benefits to be derived from it. Nevertheless, as the
following review of present efforts will show, everybody is doing
something. </p>

<p>Between 1968 and 1970, the National Institute of Mental Health
conducted a national television campaign against drugs, featuring
spots created by the Grey Advertising Company with famous
&quot;name personalities,&quot; such as Rod Serling and the
Everly Brothers. Air time was donated on a public-service basis,
and eighteen different films were supplied to every major network
station and most independents. Radio stations also aired antidrug
messages, twelve in all. Some fourteen posters and pamphlets were
mailed out to supplement the campaign. No one knows what the
total effect was, aside from generating 22 million requests for
information. Gerald Kurtz, Director of the Office of
Communication at NIMH, has been quoted as saying that the effort,
which was specifically youth-oriented, was not expected to turn
young people away from drugs. Its real purpose, rather, was to
heighten the concern of laymen and private organizations and
create national awareness of the problem of drug abuse. </p>

<p>In 1970, a new national media campaign was begun under White
House sponsorship, based on the same untested assumption that
television can &quot;unsell&quot; drug usage. According to the
prevailing theory, peer pressure against drugs can be created to
reinforce those who have not yet tried drugs or are only very
occasional users. The approach still lumps all drugs together
under the slogan &quot;Why Do You Think They Call It Dope?&quot;
Some black reporters have criticized it as obviously a product of
the white advertising world, both in its content and in its style
of presentation. It was put together by the Compton Agency, which
worked through the Advertising Council. The new campaign started
by directing its programs to the preteen group, then moved to
high school and college audiences, then to blacks, parents, and
the military. While medical hazards are mentioned, the emphasis
is on inculcating the attitude that taking drugs is
&quot;stupid&quot; rather than on presenting factual information.
</p>

<p>Other groups have entered the media fight against drug abuse.
In February, 1971, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting began
airing eight one-hour programs entitled &quot;The Turned-On
Crisis.&quot; The series, intended for general audiences,
includes programs on several facets of the drug problem. For
those more involved in the drug problem, CPB can also provide an
in-service training program of six thirty-minute segments for
teachers and school administrators and an in-class series of
eight twenty-minute programs for junior high school youth. </p>

<p>There are many efforts to develop effective television and
radio antidrug spot ads, but whether any such device can
counterbalance everyday pressures supporting drug use is
doubtful. It has been pointed out that most teenagers listen
incessantly to the radio, while their television viewing is
sporadic, and that radio spots repeated between rock songs are
more likely to reach them than spots on television. But merely
reaching the audience is not enough; the ads must be effective.
Some stations that carry antidrug spots have complained of a lack
of good material but an abundance of poor, ineffective material.
The National Institute of Mental Health has provided funds to the
National Coordinating Council on Drug Education to evaluate radio
and television material; the results are included in a monthly
newsletter, Tune In, distributed to approximately 5,600 radio and
television stations. Included are reviews of spot announcements,
factual programs, interviews, and public-service announcements
available to the media for broadcasting. </p>

<p>A black-audience station in Woodside, New York-WWRL has
adopted a more direct approach: It asks listeners to call in the
names of pushers, which it then submits to the police; the
caller's anonymity is kept, and all tips are investigated. The
station contends that thirty-two arrests have been made in six
months as a result of this campaign. It also broadcasts a
referral telephone number for those who want help with their own
drug problems. </p>

<p>Other radio stations are beginning to use the rock sound in
communicating antidrug messages. Disk jockeys, for example, play
authentic-sounding rock tunes with lyrics describing youthful
deaths caused by overdoses or by the ingestion of poor-quality
street drugs, in the hope that the young will pay serious heed.
But some teenagers resent this attempt to make the scare approach
pleasing to the ear. </p>

<p>The subject of rock music raises another question about the
relation between national media and the drug problem. Some
observers believe that the media are better at aggravating the
problem than at solving it. Songs with so-called drug-related
lyrics were banned from the airwaves by the Federal
Communications Commission because of their alleged potential to
glamorize drug abuse. This action was vigorously opposed by
underground radio stations, record companies, and private
organizations, which castigated the FCC for exercising censorship
and imposing an &quot;establishment&quot; interpretation of music
on the general public. A booklet put out by the Justice
Department's Bureau of Narcotics, entitled Drug Taking in Youth,
declares that, &quot;Numerous entertainers whose records are
played frequently are drug advocates. Many popular songs have
hidden or expressed drug allusions. Underground FM radio stations
late at night reach many young people with 'acid' rock and their
overt or disguised messages about drug use, sources, and
availability. Rock festivals are frequently advertised through
this medium.&quot;&quot; The effects of rock lyrics on an
individual's decision to use drugs still remain a mystery,
however, clouded by the contradictory pronouncements of
government spokesmen and rock-music enthusiasts. </p>

<p>Television has also been charged with contributing negatively
to the drug problem because of its steady advertising of over-the
counter drugs. In 1969, drug manufacturers reportedly spent $13.7
million for television promotion of seventeen brands of sedatives
and stimulants alone. All types of advertising for all
proprietary drugs involved expenditures of $282 million. Messages
that are criticized for &quot;pushing&quot; over-the-counter
medication promise to solve problems and alleviate everyday
stresses. The manufacturer of a popular pain reliever supports a
successful advertising package attributing love, success,
tranquillity, self confidence, health, and so on, ad infinitum,
to its product. Another commercial selling children's vitamins
shows two youngsters floating through the sky on a magic carpet
after chewing the tablets. </p>

<p>Although manufacturers of proprietary (over-the-counter) drugs
deny the cause-and-effect relationship between advertising and
abuse, many public groups are adamant about eliminating mood drug
advertisements. The National Association of Broadcasters, for
example, has proposed content restraints and criteria for the
broadcasting of such messages. Both the FTC and HEW have been
studying the relationship between over-the-counter drug ads on
television and drug abuse. Members of Congress are also holding
hearings on advertising that urges mood alteration through
nonprescription drugs. An HEW-sponsored study concludes: </p>

<p>By and large, advertising, per se, seems to have a relatively
low level of general influence upon students, when compared to
other environmental factors such as home (parents) and school
(peer groups) . This suggests that advertising is not, by itself,
responsible for student behavior toward drugs and/or other
products, substances or activities. </p>

<p>At most, advertising operates within the context of the
student's total environment and cannot be uniquely responsible
for student values, attitudes and beliefs. </p>

<p>Even though advertising, per se, may not be considered
uniquely responsible for attitudes towards legal and illegal
drugs, the students, nevertheless, feel that it is potentially an
influencing agent, particularly on the youngest students.30 </p>

<p>The study, based on interviews with 560 fifth-, seventh-, and
eleventh-grade California students, covered drugs of all kinds,
including Compoz, Contac, Alka-Seltzer, Bayer Aspirin, as well as
Salem and Marlboro cigarettes. Students questioned after viewing
the ads expressed disbelief of the advertiser's claims, as
follows: Cornpoz-46 per cent; Salem-31 per cent; Contac-40 per
cent; Bayer Aspirin-19 per cent; Alka-Seltzer-12 per cent;
Marlboro -11 per cent. The study also found that &quot;users of
illegal drugs tend to be more receptive to proprietary drug ads
than non-users.&quot; Concluding that such ads may be a
&quot;cultural prop in the maintenance of favorable attitudes
toward drug usage among the young, the study suggested that the
industry initiate an examination of&quot; promotional programs
and more government studies of children's receptivity. </p>

<p>No formal report has been released on the FTC study.
Nevertheless, it is the view of a number of FTC staff members, as
well as some scientists and some officials of BNDD, that such a
relationship does exist in certain cases.&quot; In any event,
many lawyers are convinced that the FTC has the power to attack
many of the suspicious ads without necessarily proving the
existence of such a relationship. </p>

<p>A study by four physicians at the University of Southern
California pointed out that high-pressure advertising of
prescription drugs to physicians depends on a technique of
&quot;mystification.&quot;&quot; The ads identify ordinary human
reactions and emotions as symptoms of physical illness and then
prescribe a drug as remedy. Tofranil, an antidepressant drug, is
cited as one example. The ad suggests that parents agonizing over
a runaway daughter might be treated with the drug. The same
technique may be applied to television ads for proprietary drugs
that impel the listener to seek a drug remedy for the relief of
normal tensions arising from interpersonal relations. </p>

<p>Another example is the excessive use of over-the-counter
drugs. Richard Blum reports that those who use such drugs heavily
assert more frequently than others that medicines make a
difference in the way one feels; also, they recall having more
medicines in their childhood homes than do light users. Not
surprisingly, therefore, they are more likely to use drugs to
reduce fear, induce courage, or change mood in social
situations.&quot; Similarly, many youths learn favorable
attitudes about drugs through underground newspapers; yet, these
papers often present accurate reports about specific drug dangers
and effects. This source of information should not be ignored,
even though its ideological slant may be quite different from
that of official sources of drug education. If solid research
shows that a drug has severe toxic effects, an underground paper
may be the quickest and surest way to communicate with those most
likely to be damaged by it. For example, Washington, D.C.'s
Quicksilver Times has printed the pharmacological analyses of
street samples provided by the Washington Free Clinic as a
warning of the unreliability of certain varieties of drugs then
available. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>FILMS AND AUDIO VISUALS</b> </p>

<p>The recent emphasis on school drug-education programs has
produced a receptive market for drug films and audiovisual
materials; in the past few years, the number of these teaching
devices has reached approximately two hundred. The potential
value of visual teaching cannot be disputed-it makes learning
situations more realistic and more acceptable, especially to
television-oriented youth. The problem, however, for any school
or civic group is how to distinguish between effective material
and that which is inaccurate or counterproductive. Certainly,
there ought to be readily accessible, up-to-date evaluations of
drug films by both experienced adult and student viewers,
indicating the content, level of sophistication, target audience,
and goal orientation of the films. Different reviewers may well
come to different conclusions, but the plethora of drug films now
being sold or given away makes a meaningful choice impossible in
the absence of some reasonably reliable guide. </p>

<p>The Educational Products Information Exchange, which de<br>
</p>

<p>spots and films created by young people tend to present
information that is honest and sensitive to the needs of their
peers. </p>

<p>Many evaluators criticize existing films for not conforming to
the life-styles of the viewer, for containing technical
inaccuracies, and for failing to use either black or Puerto Rican
actors or, at least, a Spanish soundtrack. It has been suggested
that students do not identify with actors or even with real
people in a strange setting, and that movies made in the
students' own locale may have more effect. Several drug-treatment
programs are planning homemade movies set against familiar
backgrounds. Such a series was made in Bedford-Stuyvesant by
local talent, under the sponsorship of the Bedford-Stuyvesant
Restoration Corporation, and was shown on New York's Channel 13. </p>

<p>Most problems, however, seem to occur once the film is in the
teacher's hands, ready for use. Fortunately, most film reports
are accompanied by remarks on how to use the materials
effectively. Previewing is the essential first step, preferably
with students as well as with adult screeners. Films should not
be shown if they fail to meet the audience's level of knowledge
and sophistication. Next, creative interaction should take place
between the audience, the educator, and the film. Students should
be allowed to give their own evaluation or to discuss their
feelings about the film's message. </p>

<p>A plethora of commercial films focusing on the youthful drug
culture has flooded the market. As is to be expected, many such
movies sensationalize and exploit the drug-abuse problem. A few,
however, present the cruel realities of drug addiction in a
sensitive manner, thus meriting their use in student and adult
educational programs. The Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs
feels that &quot;recent films directed to youth ... initiate them
into the drug scene.&quot; </p>

<p>The emphasis on student participation has prompted a new
method-videotaping the students' own discussions on drugsthat is
being tried in many classrooms. Educators are able to gain
insights from studying the dynamics of the situation, and
students profit from observing themselves in peer-group settings
attempting to solve problems and make decisions collectively.
Outside the schools, videotapes have been used successfully in
adult training courses, especially those focusing on increasing
the participants' level of communication. For most, the
experience becomes a mirror reflecting strengths, weaknesses, and
limitations in dealing with others. Unlike the passive screening
of drug education films, live videotape replays often enhance the
ability of teachers and parents to relate to young people.
Unfortunately, however, videotape apparatus is too costly for
most schools and civic groups. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>SCHOOL CURRICULA</b> </p>

<p>Paralleling the proliferation of antidrug films has been the
emergence of packaged curricula. Private businesses, state
departments of education, local school systems, publishers,
pharmaceutical manufacturers, professional associations,
consulting firms, and universities have all jumped on the
bandwagon in response to the growing demand for ready-made drug
courses. These vary tremendously in quality, content, and
approach. Some are very useful, while others are aimed merely at
exploiting the commercial market, offering little more than the
basic facts about drugs with a few suggestions about research
projects for students. The better material offers teachers
thoughtful background information on specific drugs, suggestions
for effective course presentation and teaching aids and flexible
lesson plans. </p>

<p>Such publications as the NIMH Resource Book for Drug Abuse
Education and Teaching About Drugs: A Curriculum Guide, K-12,
issued by the American School Health-Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
Association, contain excellent background material on particular
drugs. The National Clearinghouse for Drug Abuse Information will
send, on request, eight model curricula from various school
systems, again without endorsement or evaluation of their
appropriateness for different target groups. As a total package,
the booklets provide a valuable diversity of approaches as well
as supplemental resources. A few of the education packages
encourage self-examination by both teachers and students. </p>

<p>The current emphasis on youthful self-evaluation has given
rise to techniques stressing the importance of student values in
making decisions about drugs. Those who promulgate the value
approach contend that behavior and personal values are
inseparable. Richard E. Carney believes that drug abuse can be
prevented, or at least explained, if it is viewed as an
individual's attempt to actualize his values. In one of his
studies, drug users placed significantly less value on such
categories as &quot;power&quot; as it related to participation in
student organizations, clubs, and &quot;politics&quot;;
&quot;affection&quot; and &quot;respect&quot; as they related to
their willingness to become involved in parental conferences on
important personal subjects; and &quot;skill&quot; as it related
to participation in sports and organized activities.&quot; But no
one knows how students come to hold certain values, or why some
values are more prevalent than others. This may explain the
adamant refusal of many schools to consider adoption of the
value-clarifying curriculum until more concrete data are made
available. Channels are opening up, however, and skeptical
educators are becoming more tolerant of &quot;radical&quot;
approaches to education. Several counties in Maryland, for
example, recently adopted a value-oriented curriculum package
developed by Drug Central, a division of Washington, D.C.'s
Council of Governments. As is often the case with new methods,
the Maryland teachers are in need of special training programs to
assure positive results in the classroom. At present, increasing
numbers of schools are adopting this approach and report
favorable responses from students and teachers alike. </p>

<p>Other imaginative innovations in the field are receiving
favorable support from the educational community. The Creative
Learning Group in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has integrated
materials available for elementary and junior high schools
focusing on problem solving and teaching younger children how to
make decisions about life and drugs. A vast array of unique
teaching aids is offered for classes, and teachers are equipped
with a comprehensive manual containing drug-abuse information,
sound medical information for use in emergencies, and suggestions
for generating group discussions. The group's services will be
broadened to include short-term programs, guides for student
counselors, preschool film strips, and materials for inner-city,
Spanish-speaking youngsters. </p>

<p>Macro Systems, Inc., has a complex package consisting of a
self-discovery kit for use by the teacher in finding out his own
position on drugs and exploring his own biases, before proceeding
to lead an objective and probing discussion among his students.
It also contains a consensus map for the classroom that enables
students to plot their own attitudes compared with those of their
peers. </p>

<p>It is encouraging to note that at least one group, New
Dimensions Publishing Company, has responded to the scarcity of
materials for minorities. This New York City firm produces books
in Spanish and English for blacks, Puerto Ricans, and Mexican
Americans at the elementary level. </p>

<p>There are undoubtedly other good materials that we did not
happen to find. As yet, no one can prove that any particular
package or curriculum has an edge over others. There is no
present basis of comparison, since distributors rarely make
provisions for evaluation, student testing, periodical
re-evaluation, or updating of their materials, although the
Office of Education is funding efforts in the area. </p>

<p>For any curriculum, it is essential that teachers be
sensitized to the philosophy, techniques, and goals of the
materials. If the instructors fear the subject and doubt their
ability to teach it, the odds are that they will not succeed with
young people, regardless of the caliber of the materials. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>EDUCATION FOR NONSTUDENTS</b> </p>

<p>Despite massive expenditures on public drug-abuse-education
programs, there is still widespread ignorance of basic drug facts
among the population at large. For instance, a New York Addiction
Control Commission survey of 6,000 persons aged thirteen and up
found that one out of every four regarded drug abuse as among the
top four problems facing the nation. Yet, 67 per cent had no idea
what should be done about it; 60 per cent did not know what state
agencies were at work on the problem; and 50 per cent did not
know what effects heroin or amphetamines had on users.&quot; A
Gallup poll in December, 1970, showed that 64 per cent of the
adults and 39 per cent of the students interviewed thought drugs
were a serious problem in the public schools.&quot; </p>

<p>In most cases, parents, teachers, and community leaders are
more in need of accurate information about drugs than students
are. Parental responses to a student's involvement in drugs can
curb or accelerate further experimentation. It is therefore
unfortunate that most school drug-education programs have not
prepared parents to deal with the complex drug issue. For parents
need not only accurate information but also the ability to
discriminate between the effects of experimenting once with
marijuana and those of heavy involvement with drugs as well as
the ability to establish and maintain lines of honest
communication with their children. Thus, to begin with,
school-education programs should include a parent component.
Several sessions could be designed to encourage adult
participation and interaction with groups of young people.
Community information and education programs sponsored by private
and public organizations could also serve to reach and inform
parents. Even more importantly parents need a place to go for
specific help when they find drug abuse in their own family. As
noted in a newspaper article, &quot;This is sheer panic that
simply cannot wait. If advice is not quickly available, fear,
anxiety, rage or protectivism takes over. If action is taken
during the panic and without advice, irrevocable damage may be
done to the sick victim as well as to the total family structure
and relationships.&quot;&quot; </p>

<p>As a general rule, parent &quot;help&quot; programs should
impart sympathy and counseling together with facts. The guilt,
fear, and anger parents are likely to feel when a family drug
crisis occurs should be channeled into constructive action
through effective self-help programs. Parents of drug-dependent
children can also help each other. It is often beneficial to talk
to someone else who has been through a family drug crisis in
trying to approach the situation calmly and objectively. No one
is better prepared to provide this assistance than those parents
who have been forced to deal with their own children's abuse of
drugs. Opinion varies concerning the value of involving parents
in group discussions with their own children. Some planners
insist that direct family interaction is always
counterproductive, while others advocate the confrontation of
familial problems after the initial ice-breaking session. </p>

<p>New York's ASA runs programs for parents and relatives of
serious drug-users and for community residents worried about the
problem in their neighborhood generally. Several school programs
(as in Nassau County, New York, and in Los Angeles) also run
special sessions for the parents of children enrolled in the
schools. In some, parents participate with youngsters (not their
own) in group discussions on why young people use drugs. There
are, of course, a multitude of drug-information programs run by
civic groups, eager to involve parents. (In Miami, for instance,
about two dozen organizations have drug-abuse education
programs.) Many parent-oriented programs focus too heavily on how
to recognize the symptoms of drug usage and may provoke needless
confrontation between parent and child. Many are not prepared to
help in actual cases. Until very recently, most urban centers had
no place where parents could go for balanced personal advice
about what to do when they suspected, or discovered, their child
was using drugs. </p>

<p>Experts do not agree on how a parent should react when
confronted with a drug-abuse crisis. They all begin by urging the
parent not to panic but differ markedly on what should be done in
coping with the crisis. Some suggest that the parent compel the
child to seek treatment, even by threatening to throw him out of
the house. Others counsel the parent to be patient and
understanding in an effort to get at the underlying problems. Dr.
Paul Blachley suggests that relatives of a drug user be told that
&quot;bailing him out&quot; encourages continuation of dependence
and drug use and advises that they not be accessory to the
problem.&quot; Sidney Cohen, former director of NIMH's drug
program, advocates a middle course, urging parents to demonstrate
an attitude of &quot;I love you and I will help you, but I won't
support you if you persist in behavior that I believe to be
detrimental to you.&quot;&quot; He further advises that these
decisions must be made on an individual basis, depending on the
drugs involved, the child's age, and his willingness to seek help
voluntarily. </p>

<p>Of course, other adults who come into contact with youth need
accurate information on drugs-especially teachers, counselors,
policemen, and doctors. How much information is needed has yet to
be assessed. Nevertheless, NIMH recently funded the Bureau of
Social Science Research to study the knowledge levels of
professionals who have contact with the drug scene in Baltimore
and San Francisco. The study will focus on eleven occupational
groups, including policemen, probation officers, pediatricians,
general practitioners, psychologists, social workers, teachers,
school administrators, and counselors. Results should cast some
light on the level of knowledge in the various professions, as
well as on prevailing attitudes, and should indicate methods of
upgrading levels of education. </p>

<p>The current emphasis is primarily on training teachers,
especially through the Office of Education. But other youth
workers deserve attention as well. The National Coordinating
Council on Drug Education points out, with a note of lament,
that, in 1971, half of the administration's funds for drug-abuse
education were spent on teacher training. In contrast, New York
City's ASA would put primary emphasis on a training institute to
prepare a &quot;virtual army of skilled addiction
specialists&quot; to interact with drug-prone youth within the
framework of existing institutionsschools, churches, recreation
programs, settlement houses, block associations, and other
groups. </p>

<p>To enhance the effectiveness of local efforts, the National
Coordinating Council on Drug Education has put out a manual for
community action-Common Sense Lives Here-that sets out a process
whereby interested community people can define their community
drug problem and work together to solve it. Not a &quot;how
to&quot; manual, the pamphlet, together with an accompanying
film, encourage each community to mobilize its own resources and
seek the local causes and cures for increasing drug use before
attempting to formulate a plan of action. It advocates federal
planning grants for communities to finance this preparatory
process. (It is possible that such grants could be made under
Title I of the 1970 Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act.) Also,
it cautions against rushing into any major educational effort
until the nature of the local problem is clearly perceived and
adequate support has been gained. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>SPONSORS OF CURRENT EFFORTS</b> </p>

<p><b>THE FEDERAL GOVERMENT</b> </p>

<p>A number of federal agencies participate in
drug-abuse-education programming, but only five have a
substantial involvement the National Institute of Mental Health,
the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, the Office of
Education, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and
the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. Their expenditure
levels and basic activities are described in Staff Paper 5. </p>

<p>There is general agreement among these primary agencies that
their present system of program development and funding is
piecemeal, uncoordinated, and inefficient. It involves various
agencies independently supporting different drug-abuse programs
without regard for the resulting duplication of effort and wasted
resources. Ongoing programs, too, are poorly evaluated or not
evaluated at all. Consequently, the agencies have reached a dead
end. They are finding it virtually impossible to judge the
success of programs or even to design cost-benefit analyses
without comprehensive assessments. Only one fact is certain:
Millions of dollars are being spent. just how effectively funds
are being used is still unknown. </p>

<p><b>STATE AND LOCAL EFFORTS</b> </p>

<p>Virtually every sizable community in the country now has at
least one public or private drug-abuse prevention and education
program. The quality of these efforts varies from one area to
another, depending, for example, on the flow of funding
information from Washington, the attitudes and concerns of local
citizens, the fiscal condition of the locality, and the number of
agencies active in prevention programming. State education
administrators agree that there are too many crash programs
concentrating on drug education in isolation; that there is not
enough coordination of effort where many agencies are in the same
field; that there is too much attention to medical and legal
factors and not enough to social and psychological factors; and
that, finally, there is too little an attempt to relate specific
drug use to the &quot;drug culture,&quot; and too much reliance
on one-way education (i.e., handouts, lectures, films, and
speakers). </p>

<p>States also suffer from a lack of support from school
administrators and local political structures. The National
League of Cities/U.S. Conference of Mayors and the National
Association of Counties are responding by planning educational
programs beamed at local office holders. </p>

<p>This chaotic situation is further complicated by the
innumerable commercial firms entering the field, putting out an
avalanche of gimmicks as well as legitimate drug-education
materials, along with model school curricula, films, and cartoon
books. State planners have been inundated by the tide of
mass-produced course materials and usually have been unsuccessful
in sorting the good from the bad. </p>

<p>Different agencies in different states provide drug education
funds in response to the variety of laws. A 1970 compilation by
HEW of drug-abuse education programs supported by state education
agencies shows that twenty-one states have legal requirements for
school drug (and alcohol) education and are &quot;complying&quot;
with them. Four other states have programs in all educational
districts, despite a lack of legal requirements. In eleven states
and Puerto Rico, some, but not all, districts have school
programs. A parallel survey of drug programs supported by state
health authorities, conducted by NIMH in 1970, found that
twenty-two states had such health-related programs, and sixteen
more had them in the planning stages. </p>

<p>A major problem at the state level is lack of effective
coordination. Most states are plagued by a lack of cooperation
between existing programs, by unnecessary overlap and duplication
of effort, and by an insufficient flow of information from the
grassroots level to the legislature to stimulate effective
policies and leadership. A few states, such as Arizona,
California, and now Florida, have statewide councils to
coordinate and give direction to public and private agencies in
the field. California alone has 300 community-based drug-abuse
programs, all of which have sprung up in the past two years. New
York City has 47 identifiable drug-education programs, and New
York State has Community Narcotics Education Centers in sixteen
localities, manned by professionals, as well as 57 local
narcotics-guidance councils to coordinate local programs. </p>

<p>To eliminate the fragmentation that exists among the states, a
National Association of State Drug Abuse Coordinators was
organized recently. Since it is still in the organizational
stages, however, its impact remains uncertain. </p>

<p><b>PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS</b> </p>

<p>A plethora of professional organizations, social-welfare
associations, charitable volunteer organizations, and other
groups also conduct community education programs. Few, if any, of
these programs have been evaluated with regard to their impact on
a target population or their record of accomplishing specific
goals. They rarely assume an action-oriented role, preferring
instead simply to disseminate educational brochures and
audiovisuals. Their programs all look rational and successful on
paper, but no one has any real notion of their effectiveness,
except, perhaps, for a pervasive feeling that nothing they have
done so far has made much difference. In fact, they are often
criticized for jumping into the drug field without first asking
for experienced advice on what their role ought to be. Also, the
huge sums of money they expended on mediocre printed materials
would, according to people involved in delivery of service
programs, be better spent on the treatment and rehabilitation of
addicts. </p>

<p>On the other hand, some private groups do make successful use
of low-key approaches in performing unique and valuable services.
Several minority professional associations, for example, sponsor
clinics that provide dental care for addicts and support halfway
houses that offer counseling, job placement, and training to
hard-core, youthful drug abusers. Undergraduate chapters of black
fraternal organizations educate members of their campus
communities, while their graduate counterparts initiate the
involvement of local groups in educational programs and
&quot;action&quot; workshops. Another case involves student
professionals who spend their summer months working in
interdisciplinary teams, providing improved health-care delivery
(including drug treatment and related legal services) to
inner-city residents. Finally, several organizations whose main
focus is drug abuse not only encourage research and conduct
training sessions for professionals but offer free consultation
to people setting up treatment centers. </p>

<p>Inherent in the structure of national groups is a widespread
network for the dissemination of materials and information. These
expansive communication mechanisms are frequently used to support
legislative reform efforts and to provide information to the
media and the public on the subject of drugs. </p>

<p>Federal money is not being spent to evaluate ongoing
educational programs. As the National Coordinating Council on
Drug Education has testified: </p>

<p>There is a danger from continued massive education programming
without first taking the time to evaluate what has been done,
what needs to be done, and what can be done. Unexamined and
unevaluated information and education programs are certainly no
answer; and it is safe to say that in some instances they may be
as harmful in the long run as no program at all .44 </p>

<p>Most private efforts are limited, and many are local in scope.
A few, however, are important forces nationally. With public
attention being focused on the drug-abuse problem, increasing
numbers of national drug organizations have begun to emerge, and
many of them project coordination as their main function. The
most inclusive of these is the National Coordinating Council on
Drug Education, formed in 1968 as a coordinating group for public
agencies and private organizations involved in drug-abuse
education. The Council's philosophy emphasizes rational
approaches to drug-related issues. Any interdisciplinary
regional, state, or local organization whose purpose relates to
drug education is eligible for membership. National organizations
wishing to cooperate with NCCDE in achieving its goals may also
join. At present, most members are white, middle-class
organizations, although there are a few black groups, again
primarily middleclass. Federal agencies are assured of the
Council's cooperation. The National Coordinating Council has been
financed by government contracts, private foundation funds,
contributions from private industry, and donations from its
members. </p>

<p>NCCDE has been quite independent despite its government
funding. It refused to join in National Drug Abuse Prevention
Week because it felt that such one-shot crash campaigns were
useless; it criticized the national advertising campaign; and it
filed suit against the Federal Communications Commission,
challenging its ban on rock music. Whether it will continue to
receive government support is doubtful. </p>

<p>The Student Association for the Study of Hallucinogens (STASH)
is an independent, nonprofit group run by the students
themselves. It publishes the Journal of Psychedelic Drugs,
provides reprints, issues a bibliography on hallucinogens and
other drugs, and holds regular conferences on drug abuse and
related problems; it has a good (and computerized) library
containing 90 per cent of all the literature in English on
marijuana and hallucinogens and has compiled a directory of
drug-information groups. STASH is objective and scientifically
oriented and, for the sake of credibility, will not accept any
government money. It expects, in time, to support itself totally
from membership and publication fees. </p>

<p><b>BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY</b> </p>

<p>The increasing extent of drug use in industry began to be
recognized during the last year by management and personnel
officials. Nationwide interviews with 6,000 workers in the
automobile industry recently compiled by the Alliance for Labor
Action found that about 46 per cent of the workers interviewed
who were under thirty years of age had used drugs at least
once.&quot; Of approximately 222 major businesses surveyed about
drug abuse among blue-collar workers and alcoholism among
executives, nearly two-thirds saw drug abuse as a major
industrial problem, either now or in the immediate future, and 53
per cent had already discovered some form of drug abuse in their
organization.&quot; </p>

<p>The existence of drug abuse in a business creates serious
problems for an employer. It is legitimate for him to consider
whether the employee's behavior on the job endangers other
workers or consumers, or even the image (or profits) of the
business. He can also be encouraged to understand the underlying
problems that may have led to the drug use, to help the user find
treatment, and to allow him to continue to work under
supervision. Although most businesses still maintain a &quot;find
them and fire them&quot; policy, an increasing number of
executives realize that they cannot find and do not wish to fire
all employees who use drugs. Such employers are instituting
education programs in an effort to wean employees away from drugs
and to teach management how to recognize serious drug problems
and channel workers to helping agencies when necessary.&quot; </p>

<p>Business must also be involved in another urgent problem
providing employment opportunities for ex-addicts who are in or
have completed a treatment program. Long-term rehabilitation
requires that an ex-addict be able to find a job. Governmental
and social-service agencies can contribute greatly to this-the
Vera Institute and the City of New York are pioneering the
employment of patients who are in treatment in specially
supervised work projects-but real progress will depend upon the
tolerance and assistance of far-sighted employers. More
experimental work is needed, of course, to determine the
problems, possibilities, and legitimate expectations of
employment programs. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>CONCLUSION</b> </p>

<p>This examination of current drug-education efforts indicates
that additional money is not the most urgent requirement.
Creative individuals are needed to act as catalysts for the
growth, testing, and support of creative educational approaches.
Evaluation is vital, as is a climate that encourages the
translation of research findings into action. Educational
programming must respond to differences among addicts in
ethnicity, age, and mental set. Finally, concerted efforts to
clarify goals, drug knowledge, and institutional responsibilities
are essential. </p>

The authors cite examples of such statements as follows: </p>

<p>1. &quot;The epidemic of drug abuse is rapidly becoming a
national emergency. Part of the responsibility for this must be
borne by the drug industry, radio and television. just as
cigarette commercials made smoking romantic, manly, relaxing,
smart, and 'in,' drug advertising has helped'turn on' our
civilization, especially our youth. We are constantly bombarded
by people on television with an easy solution to any of our
troubles, most of it half truth or lies. The continuous selling
of drugs on television and radio must be stopped. All drug
advertising should be prohibited from the mass media, a small
step toward regaining our children.&quot; (Letter from Robert A.
Levine, M.D., to the editor, 282 New England journal of Medicine,
pp. 1378-79 [1970].) </p>

<p>2. &quot;Our technology provides us with highly potent
synthetic materials and through the mass media means to inform
any person who can read, listen, or look about these dangerous
substances. In this situation it is all too easy for anyone of
any age who does not like the way he lives to try a drug'high'in
search of a mystique of esoteric meaning, of euphoria, or of
oblivion.&quot; (Stanley F. Yolles, M.D., &quot;The Drug
Phenomenon,&quot; NS10 journal of American Pharmaceutical
Association, p. 403 [1970].) </p>

<p>3. &quot;Our culture and communications media teach children
that one solves almost all problems by 'turning on@-drugs for
headaches, constipation, sleeplessness, 'nerves,' and for
whatever other maladies beset us.&quot; (Allen Y. Cohen, Ph.D.,
&quot;Inside What's Happening: Sociological, Psychological, and
Spiritual Perspectives on the Contemporary Drug Scene,&quot; 59
American journal of Public Health, pp. 2090,2093 [1969].) </p>

<p>4. &quot;The impact of mass media advertising . . . tends to
create a psychological dependence upon drugs as a palliative for
the strains and stresses of contemporary society.&quot; (Dr.
Donald C. Brodie, Drug Trade News, June 15, 1970, p. 8.) </p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>INTRODUCTION<br>
</i></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">HISTORY OF TREATMENT <br>
</font></p>

<p>The beginnings of our current narcotics problem go back over a
century. As many authors have noted, the United States had a
large number of opiate addicts in the period between the Civil
War and the passage of the Harrison Act, which limited the
availability of drugs, in 1914. These addicts were primarily
white, female, rural, lower to lower-middle class, and
middle-aged.' They regularly injected morphine or took morphine
or opiated patent medicine orally. Opiates were freely available
from the local pharmacy, so they were not criminals. </p>

<p>Some of them did not even know that they were addicted to
narcotics. Patent medicines were not always labeled, and the user
may have known only that he felt sick when he did not take a
particular medicine, not realizing that the problem was
withdrawal from the medicine itself. Most were knowingly
addicted, of course, and addiction was a matter of great
individual concern. Physicians had developed many different
&quot;cures&quot; between 1856 and 1914, and the effort continued
thereafter. In 1928, Dr. Charles Terry and Mildren Pellens, after
reviewing these efforts extensively, stated: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>. . . for the most part, the treatment of this condition
    has not emerged from the stage of empiricism. The various
    methods described in general indicate that the basis of the
    majority of them is merely the separation of the patient from
    the drug. Very few of those who have described the details of
    treatment have given a rationale for their procedures but
    rather have outlined dogmatically the adoption of certain
    measures whose primary object is the withdrawal of the drug
    and have stated or left the reader to infer that the
    completion of the procedure brings about cure <font size="1">.2
    <br>
    </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>True to the spirit of the age, there were also numerous patent
medicine &quot;cures&quot; available, some of which were
themselves laden with opiates. </p>

<p>It is difficult to recapture the dominant attitudes toward
addiction during this period. Terry and Pellens cite contemporary
sources contending that addiction was a vice, a physical disease,
a moral perversion, a product of neurotic inheritance, or a
result of morphine poisoning.' Much of the debate is cast in
terms of virtue and vice, and it is hard to tell what these terms
meant to the participants. On the whole, however, the arguments
are remarkably similar to those used in current debate about
addiction. </p>

<p>While there was no consensus on the nature or causes of
addicrecognized as a significant publiclegislative action
developed. The Act in 1914 changed the problem opiates were to be
controlled and than freely available on the open market. </p>

<p>It is not clear what response the lawmakers expected from the
medical establishment. They may have expected doctors to keep on
supplying existing addicts while avoiding the creation of new
ones; they may have expected doctors to force addicts to give up
their habit by refusing to prescribe narcotics; they may not have
thought about it at all. In any event, at passage of the Harrison
Act, the country had at least 200,000 to 300,000 opiate addicts
who were now cut off from their normal sources of supply and
unable to receive drugs except through physicians. </p>

<p>One result was predictable, although not necessarily
predicted: Physicians were deluged with addicts seeking drugs.' A
survey conducted by a Treasury Department committee in 1918 that
reached 31 per cent of the physicians in the United States found
that they had 73,150 addicts under treatment. Treatment, the
committee believed, meant supplying drugs.' In addition to, and
partly in replacement of, private physicians, more than 40
maintenance clinics were opened from about 1918. Most were
sponsored by cities. </p>

<p>Whatever the lawmakers may have thought about the nature of
addiction, the law enforcers considered maintaining existing
addicts on opiates unacceptable. This group believed that, once
the drug was removed and the addict had gone through withdrawal,
he should have no further problems. Rufus King has given some
examples of this view: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>the medical conclusion, propounded as not open to question
    [was] that drug addiction was a correctable and curable
    condition, viz. the following preface to the Prohibition
    Bureau's Regulations: &quot;It is well-established that the
    ordinary case of addiction will yield to proper treatment,
    and that addicts will remain permanently cured when drug
    addiction is stopped and they are otherwise physically
    restored to health and strengthened in will power.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Moreover, a small but strident segment of the medical
    community went even further than the authorities ... In 1921
    a member of the American Medical Association's Committee on
    Narcotic Drugs, purportedly speaking officially for the
    Association, was quoted [as saying]: &quot;The shallow
    pretense that drug addiction is a disease which the
    specialist must be allowed to treat, which pretended
    treatment consists in supplying its victims with the drug
    which has caused their physical and moral debauchery .... has
    been asserted and urged in volumes of literature by the
    self-styled specialists.&quot;,,<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To people with this mental set, the maintenance clinics served
no useful purpose; they simply prolonged the addictive state
instead of curing it. If one assumes that abstinence is
relatively easy, then drug maintenance does appear to be the
equivalent of drug pushing. The government put severe pressure on
the clinics, and the last one was closed in 1923.' </p>

<p>At the same time, a very tough policy toward physicians was
maintained. The Narcotic Division of the Treasury Department
arrested or threatened 14,701 persons registered to dispense
drugs under the Harrison Act in 1918, 22,595 in 1919 and 47,835
in 1920.' Between 1914 and 1938, 25,000 doctors were arrested for
supplying opiates, and 5,000 of them actually went to jail.'
Those doctors who maintained that addiction was more complicated
than what the official view held, and who advocated maintenance,
were purged from the field. </p>

<p>It is tempting today to condemn this enforcement policy as
both cruel and ineffective. It was certainly cruel, but its real
effect will never be known. To begin with the most elementary
question, no one knows whether the policy of closing off
legitimate sources of supply decreased the total number of
addicts. The Federal Bureau of Narcotics has estimated that the
number of addicts declined from 200,000 at the time of the
Harrison Act in 1914 to 118,000 in 1930, 60,000 in 1936, and
20,000 in 1945. Dr. Alfred Lindesmith has pointed out that these
estimates are improbable, since they depend on the proposition
that new addicts were not being recruited to replace those who
died or quit the habit. if this were true, the average age of
addicts would have risen as the population aged. In fact, the
average age declined steadily throughout the period, and the
other demographic characteristics of the population also changed,
so there must have been substantial recruitment. Lindesmith
reached no firm conclusion on absolute numbers, but pointed out:
&quot;Since the range of estimates of the addicted population at
present is at least as great as it was before 1914, one can make
out a case for any trend one chooses by judiciously selecting the
estimates.&quot;&quot; </p>

<p>One can argue that the policy worked fairly well for the
addicts of the early part of the century, who were 60 per cent
female, 90 per cent white, rural rather than urban, and middle or
lower-middle class rather than impoverished. By 1945, the addict
population was about 85 per cent male and only 75 per cent white,
a substantial change in character. Since then, the addict
population has remained about 85 per cent male and become
steadily younger as well as more minority-group-concentrated. In
New York City, for example, the Narcotics Register shows 47 per
cent of the addicts to be black, 27 per cent Puerto Rican,&quot;
and 26 per cent white. During the last two or three years,
addiction has been spreading back into the middle class, but this
is not a marked trend as yet. Clearly, the population of the
1910's and 1920's did not replace itself, and this could be
judged a successful result of sorts. </p>

<p>By any account, a hard core of addicts remained after the
closing of the clinics. During the 1920's, they were largely
ignored, and treatment for opiate addiction disappeared for a
decade. Then, in 1935 and 1938, the Public Health Service clinics
in Fort Worth and Lexington were opened, largely because of
problems created by addicts in the prisons. The basic theory of
treatment remained unchanged since the earlier period-if an
addict could be separated from his drug for a time, he could be
counted as cured. It was generally believed by this time that the
horrors of withdrawal were so great that few real addicts would
undertake it on their own, but that a few months at one of the
clinics would see them through withdrawal and allow them to
recover. Once they went back to the community, it was presumed,
they would never want to go near the drug again because of their
fear of withdrawal. </p>

<p>Subsequent studies have indicated that the PHS clinics did not
work very well.&quot; This was not generally recognized at the
time, however, and there was another hiatus in the development of
new treatment techniques until the explosion of urban addiction
in the 1950's and 1960's. During the latter part of this period,
several new methods came into being in response to the obvious
inadequacies of the old ones. </p>

<p>Synanon, founded in 1959, became the precursor of a line of
therapeutic communities that emphasized the psychological
component of readdiction and tried to restructure the addict's
character. During the next decade, many such communities were
founded across the country. The apogee of the movement was
probably reached in New York City's Addiction Services Agency
between 1965 and 1968. At the same time, civil-commitment
programs more or less on the Lexington model were applied on a
large scale by California starting in 1961 and by New York State
and the federal government starting in 1967. </p>

<p>In 1964, Dr. Vincent Dole pioneered in the use of methadone, a
synthetic opiate substitute for heroin. Methadone maintenance has
grown rapidly in the last few years, and, as of 1971, it is the
technique into which most new money is going. </p>

<p>Contemporaneously with methadone, researchers at Lexington in
1965 began experimenting with the use of antagonists-drugs that
block the effects of opiates without themselves being addictive.
This method, however is still experimental, has a great many
problems, and is not yet an operating modality. </p>

<p>At present, the dominant treatment modalities are therapeutic
communities, civil commitment, outpatient abstinence, and
metbadone maintenance. A large number of hybrid programs,
however, have developed in response to the concern over addiction
during the late 1960's. Some are explicitly multimodal, utilizing
all the major techniques. There are also detoxification programs
that simply take an addict through withdrawal, often using
methadone but sometimes not; there are also crisis intervention
centers, and programs that supply very small doses of methadone
on demand. Many community organizations have become active in the
field, with operations of all types and combinations. </p>

<p>For purposes of clarity, this paper imposes more order on the
field than exists in practice. Methadone receives by far the most
detailed analysis. In part, this is because methadone treatment
is expanding very rapidly, and thorough analysis is therefore
especially important. It is also due to the fact that, since
methadone maintenance has been in the hands of physicians and
scientists who believe in records, evaluation, and research,
information on these programs is more readily available.<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">GOALS OF TREATMENT <br>
</font></p>

<p>The apparent goals of treatment are obvious. Society wants the
addict to stop using heroin and committing crimes and, instead,
to find a job, stabilize his personal life, generally improve his
character, and become a useful and productive citizen. Analyzing
programs in terms of these objectives presents a series of
problems, however. The first is mechanical, although important:
It is extremely difficult to get good information on the results
of programs in terms of these or any other measures of success. </p>

<p>The second is more subtle. Even when information on treatment
results can be obtained, it tends to focus on whether the patient
has stopped using heroin. This represents in part a moral
judgment that this is the most important goal of treatment and in
part the belief that abstinence is a valid proxy measure of the
achievement of the other objectives. Historically, there has also
been a tendency to believe that treatment has failed if an addict
subsequently uses narcotics for any length of time whatsoever, on
the assumption, perhaps, that any relapse automatically means
total relapse. </p>

<p>Increasingly, experts have become aware that this
concentration on abstinence is questionable. While abstinence is
to some extent a proxy for the other possible benefits of a
treatment program, it is not completely accurate. The many facets
of the addicted life-style are not totally inseparable, and,
equally important, they need not all be treated at once. After
treatment, an addict might hold a job, support a family, refrain
from criminal activity -and still go on occasional benders of
drug use. Or, he might continue to commit crimes, but fewer than
before. His physical health might be improved even if nothing
else were changed. It is also possible for a program to have a
reverse effect. It might, for example, eliminate opiate addiction
at the price of alcoholism, a dubious bargain. </p>

<p>In short, there is a range of possible benefits and adverse
effects that can be produced by treatment programs. Different
programs attach different importance to each; conflicts of value
are inherent in comparisons of effectiveness. Since such
questions are not easily resolvable, an objective examination of
treatment programs should, ideally, use varying measures rather
than only two categories-success (total abstinence) or failure
(anything else) . Abstinence, stabilization on methadone (or, in
fact, stabilization on heroin), employment, decreased criminal
conduct or non-criminal conduct, support of a family, improved
physical health and psychological functioning-any of these
outcomes represents at least partial success for a treatment
program and should be so regarded. </p>

<p>Despite the strong reservations about using abstinence as a
measure, this paper repeatedly uses freedom from drug use as the
major criterion of the success of treatment programs. While
evaluation of even this factor is fragmentary, it is far more
common than evaluation in terms of other possible measures.
Anyone trying to analyze program results has to use it as a proxy
or refrain from any judgments at all, and it is sufficiently
important to be of use. It should be emphasized, however, that
good multifactor evaluation might drastically change many of the
conclusions contained here. </p>

<p>The third problem is even more fundamental. No one knows
whether the goals of treatment as set forth in the beginning of
this section are realistic or even desirable. Since no one knows
why people become narcotics addicts, no one knows either how to
make them stop or what will happen to them if they do stop. For
example, NIMH officials recently stated that about 25 per cent of
the addict population are people who suffer from depression and
chronic anxiety, another 25 per cent are hedonists who like to
get intoxicated, and the rest are psychopaths who need immediate
gratification and are not particular about how they obtain
it.&quot; Other researchers have also concluded that there is no
one addict type, and that addiction can serve as a functional and
adaptive characteristic for people with different types of
psychic problems. </p>

<p>Yet, there are also a number of researchers who, denying this
stress on psychopathology, contend that people are inducted into
drug use through peer pressure and that large numbers of addicts
may not suffer from severe psychopathology. The argument can be
made that whatever characteristics addicts appear to have in
common are forced upon them by the requirements of sustaining the
addiction once it exists. Still another view is that addicts do
have psychological problems but that these are in many cases no
more severe than those shown by many nonaddicts. If one conducted
a mental-health survey of the population from which most addicts
are drawn, one might discover as many symptoms of mental disorder
among the nonaddicts. Finally, some argue that heroin itself
causes a metabolic change in the body that makes it difficult to
cease being an addict. Thus, one can become addicted casually and
then be unable to rid oneself of the addiction no matter what
therapeutic techniques are brought to bear. 14 </p>

<p>Treatment programs have disparate philosophies on these
questions. Some, though by no means all, methadone programs
assume some physiological basis of addiction. Most therapeutic
communities probably assume a character disorder that can be
helped by group therapy. Some outpatient abstinence programs
assume that addiction may be an almost accidental event for many
addicts, and that they can be helped with minimal intervention.
But these assumptions are not constant within any modality, and
almost all spectrums of opinion exist in each. </p>

<p>In short, there is no uniform theory of addiction and no
adequate description of the addict population. Further, addiction
has spread rapidly in recent years, and we know less about the
new population than we do about the old. And we knew little
enough before. </p>

<p>The difficulties these factors create in judging treatment
programs are obvious. We do not know what expectations are
realistic or desirable. We do not even know for certain that it
is good for addicts to stop taking drugs. Some programs may be
better for certain types of addicts than others, but we are not
sure what types, or whether the programs are attracting the type
with which they do best. </p>

<p>All the figures given in this paper are gross figures-the
programs are judged by effects on the total number of people who
were involved without any breakdown of results for different
hypothetical subgroups of the addict population. The conclusions,
therefore, are tentative, at best. <br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>ABSTINENCE PROGRAMS <br>
</i></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">DETOXIFICATION<br>
</font></p>

<p>The most straightforward way to help a heroin addict is to
detoxify him-reduce his daily heroin intake to zero and see him
through withdrawal. The addict can be maintained on an inpatient
basis without any drugs for the five-to-ten-day period necessary
for primary withdrawal symptoms to disappear; or he can be
treated with tranquilizers but not opiates; or methadone can be
used to decrease his opiate dosage gradually until he is
drugfree. </p>

<p>Detoxification services are offered in many places and modes
across the nation-in hospitals, therapeutic communities, free
clinics, and government programs. There is no way of learning how
many addicts receive them each year. </p>

<p>Detoxification has several clear benefits for both the addict
and society. Even if the addict does not intend to stay off
drugs, it reduces his habit and decreases its cost. This spares
him the hassle and society the crime costs of his addiction for
some period, even if only a few days, after the process is
complete. For some addicts, it is also a step toward
rehabilitation. After repeated failures to remain detoxified,
they become ready for other modalities. </p>

<p>On the whole, however, it is not clear that detoxification
itself contributes greatly to the achievement of long-term
abstinence. One program that used methadone in decreasing doses
found that 74 per cent of the patients either did not finish the
withdrawal program or relapsed to drug use within 48 hours after
leaving it. Another, which effects withdrawal without opiates,
found that only 10 per cent successfully completed the
withdrawal, and almost all of these soon relapsed.&quot; The New
York Narcotic Addiction Control Commission has estimated that
only 24 per cent of those who receive detoxification without
other services &quot;remain drug-free for any length of
time.&quot;&quot; </p>

<p>The Haight-Ashbury Clinic in San Francisco has been
experimenting with outpatient withdrawal, utilizing analgesics
but not opiates. It reports the results with 450 patients: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>56 per cent dropped out before they were clean and were
    lost to follow-up for at least two weeks; 5 per cent of these
    resumed their habit, 22 per cent were in treatment, and the
    rest were apparently not known. 12 per cent had decreased
    their habit to &quot;chipping&quot; no more than once a week.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>5.5 per cent had been clean for one month or more. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>38 per cent were lost track of after only one clinic
    visit.&quot; <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This population differs from the standard drug-addict
population because it includes individuals who are basically
middle class and who began using heroin after being involved in
the San Francisco speed scene; many have not been addicted for
long. No one knows whether this population is harder, or easier,
to work with than the more familiar ghetto populations. Other
program examples could be cited-some better and some worse-but
the general picture remains: Detoxification does have some
benefits, but it is primarily a service for the drug user who
needs a respite and a short-term way of protecting society
against crime rather than a long-term treatment for addiction. As
such, it is valuable, especially for anyone who believes that
addicts should be treated more humanely than they are at the
present time and that bandaids can be valuable things. But
expectations should not be too high.<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font size="1"><b>CIVIL COMMITMENT <br>
</b></font></p>

<p>In theory, civil commitment is the nonpunitive incarceration
of an addict for purposes of rehabilitation. This method of
treatment was started in the 1930's at the Lexington and Fort
Worth hospitals, where the programs were part voluntary and part
coercive. In the 1960's, civil commitment was applied on a wider
scale, first in California then in New York. Subsequently, the
federal government started using civil commitment as an
alternative to imprisonment through the Narcotic Addict
Rehabilitation Program. Dr. John Kramer has traced the
relationship between the earlier programs and the massive
investment of the 1960's: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The roots of these commitment laws can be traced to the
    federal narcotics hospital in Lexington. In recounting the
    initial expectations for that institution Isbell writes . . .
    &quot;Drug addicts were to be treated within the institution,
    freed of their physiological dependence on drugs, their basic
    immaturities and personality problems corrected by vocational
    and psychiatric therapy, after which they would be returned
    to their communities to resume their lives. It seems to have
    been tacitly assumed that this program was the answer and
    would solve the problem of opiate addiction. Within a <font
    size="2">year it was apparent this assumption was wrong . . .
    a more adequate treatment program [required]: (1) Some means
    of holding voluntary patients until they had reached maximum
    benefit from hospital treatment. (2) Greater use of probation
    and parole. (3) Provision for intensive supervision and
    aftercare. . . . Isbell goes on to say that the reasons why
    these problems were not solved were complex. &quot;In 1961
    the California Legislature enacted laws establishing a
    commitment program for addicts which was designed to
    accomplish those objectives recommended but never carried out
    at Lexington.&quot;18</font> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is generally thought that the programs started in the
1930's were almost total failures. Between 1935 and 1964, there
were 87,000 admissions to the two centers, of which 63,600 were
voluntary and 23,400 were federal prisoners. Of the voluntary
patients, 70 per cent left against medical advice. A series of
studies of addicts released from the abstinence facilities found
that up to 90 per cent of those followed up relapsed into drug
use within a few years.&quot; </p>

<p>As is true of almost every other aspect of the field, this
conclusion is debatable. Recent research has suggested that it
may exaggerate the failures. Dr. John O'Donnell points out that
all the studies had problems with data collection and with
categorization of those addicts who could not be found. He also
questions the assumption that any relapse-any use of drugs-should
be regarded as a failure, an assumption that was made by several
of the studies. As has been pointed out, an addict may become
basically abstinent, even though he does relapse a few times;
and, even if he relapses regularly, he may spend more time off
drugs than he would have without the treatment. This is also a
net social gain. </p>

<p>O'Donnell uses the following example. If one has 2,000
exaddicts in a two-year study (a total of 4,000 man-years) and
defines relapse as a two-week period of heroin use at any time,
then a 90 per cent relapse rate could mean that anywhere between
69 and 3,600 of the 4,000 man-years were spent in a state of
addiction. That is, 90 per cent of the addicts could have
relapsed for exactly two weeks each, or, at the other extreme, 90
per cent could have relapsed for the entire two years, or
anything in between.&quot; The social and individual consequences
of these polar possibilities are very different. </p>

<p>The revisionist approach to the Lexington experience has
caused many observers to soften their adverse judgments somewhat.
Most still believe that it was not effective with very many
addicts but concede that the question probably cannot be answered
definitely. The data that would allow methodologically acceptable
studies are lost. This does not seem to bother anyone too much,
however, because the Lexington population drew heavily from rural
white populations, and the exact results would be of marginal
relevance to our present situation. </p>

<p>The three programs that were started in the 1960's built on
the Lexington model, although they tried to improve it. They
appear to have been started because addiction was either
increasing or becoming more visible, and was thus becoming a
political problem. In 1961, there was simply no treatment
modality available except civil commitment, and even by 1966 it
did not appear that there was any clearly better alternative.
Under pressure to do something, state and federal authorities
picked up the only available model, apparently on the premises
that: (1) The failures of the Lexington program were due in part
to the fact that the duration of treatment was too short (six
months or a year) ; (2) Improved vocational and counseling
services would be helpful; (3) Some careful studies had indicated
that better supervision in the community after release would
improve the success rate; 21 (4) Civil commitment would at least
get addicts off the street. </p>

<p>The California program, instituted in 1961, provides for
commitment on court order in lieu of sentence or prosecution.
Voluntary commitment and commitment by relatives are also
possible, but over 90 per cent of the inmates are there
involuntarily, after conviction. In fact, the program is
structurally and functionally very similar to imprisonment. The
main center, in Corona, California, is a maximum-security
facility under the direction of the Department of Corrections.
There are armed guards and barbedwire fences, and most of the
personnel are corrections workers. The minimum institutional stay
is six months, and the average is about 14 months. After leaving
the institution the addict is required to undergo a three-year
period of &quot;community aftercare,&quot; which is essentially
&quot;parole.&quot; During this time, he follows the same regimen
as ex-felons, with the additional requirement of regular
urinalysis testing and group counseling. Violations of
t1parole&quot; can and, in the case of relapse to drug use,
usually do mean return to the institution. Attempted escape from
the institution and serious parole violations are felonies in
themselves. </p>

<p>The facility does provide inmates with a modified form of
encounter-group therapy, based on the hypothesis that drug use is
a symptom of aberrant personality patterns which must be changed.
However, a study of the program's results concluded that the
program was interpreted by addicts and professional visitors as
more punitive than therapeutic. Whether one were released
depended in large part on how well one played the game at group
sessions. This was not conducive to the honesty that real group
therapy demands. </p>

<p>Evaluation showed that between 1962 and 1964 there were 1,209
persons on release status at some time. At the end of the year,
only 35 per cent were still in good standing and only 16 per cent
maintained this status after three years. The majority who fail
in aftercare do so for drug use, &quot;poor adjustment,&quot;
failure to report in, or new arrest. During the first year, 56
per cent were detected using drugs and 20 per cent convicted of
new crimes. In the three-year period, 81 per cent had been
suspended from release status at least once. The usual pattern
for the inmate consisted of periods spent in the facility
followed by periods of abstinence in the aftercare phase, and
then return to the facility in Corona. As a result of this
pattern, inmates who would have been serving a felony sentence
(70 per cent) actually spent less time &quot;incarcerated,&quot;
while those who were guilty of misdemeanors (16 per cent) were
&quot;incarcerated&quot; longer than if they had served an
ordinary prison sentence. No later results seem to have changed
this pattern. Felon addicts who receive no therapy while in
prison do as well as or better than California Rehabilitation
Center addicts while on parole.&quot; </p>

<p>The New York program, adopted several years later, differs
somewhat in conception.&quot; Like California, New York provides
for commitment in lieu of sentence or prosecution, for voluntary
commitment, and for commitment by relatives or other persons,
such as school officials or prosecuting attorneys. Unlike the
California system, New York's system is under the direction of an
independent Narcotic Addiction Control Commission (NACC) and has
a mental-health orientation involving the use of professional
mental-health personnel. NACC is also more committed to research
and community aftercare programs. </p>

<p>New York's total program, by far the largest in the United
States, has spent $475.3 million in the last four years,
including its investment in methadone and therapeutic communities
as well as in civil commitment. The direct annual investment in
the civilcommitment program appears to be at least $50 million
out of a total budget of $88.5 million. As of the end of 1970,
NACC had 10,764 addicts in its own facilities, and another 10,419
were in facilities accredited or funded by NACC. These population
figures were not broken down by modality.&quot; </p>

<p>Despite the dominance of a mental-health approach and
professionalized therapy, the emphasis on security and remote
institutions has apparently produced a penal atmosphere at many
of the NAOC facilities. Recreational and entertainment facilities
appear to be lacking, and life in a NACC institution has been
described as a dreary round of a few hours in a classroom or
workshop, some time in group meetings led by civil servants, and
the rest of the time watching television or loafing. The peer
pressures, ex-addict, encounter-group leadership, and meaningful
work assignments needed to create an effective therapeutic
environment are absent.&quot; The program has been subject to
some fierce attacks, as in the 1970 New York gubernatorial
campaign, when one candidate claimed that in three years NACC had
spent $345 million and cured 120 addicts.&quot; It is difficult
to know whether all of these accusations are justified. But it is
equally difficult to find disinterested observers who contradict
them. </p>

<p>NACC officials state their results fairly carefully. In June,
1971, the research director testified that &quot;a relatively
small number of people&quot; had been processed through the
entire civil-commitment procedure (the three to five years), and
that, of those who had gone all the way through, 25 per cent
&quot;are currently abstinent, according to a physical
follow-up.&quot; Another 25 per cent had either recertified
themselves to NACC or had entered other treatment programs. The
rest (50 per cent) were in jail as a result of new drug-related
offenses or had returned to drugs.&quot; This statement does not
reveal how many addicts had completed the program, how many were
able to drop out or escape in some way, or what level of
functioning the abstinent addicts were maintaining. The
population is referred to as &quot;small.&quot; </p>

<p>The federal NARA program of civil commitment for addicts
includes three separate programs. Title I provides for addicts
charged with violating federal laws (nonviolent crimes only). In
lieu of prosecution, the addict can be committed to a three-year
treatment period involving both institutional and aftercare
treatment facilities. Admissions under this title have been few.
Between July, 1967, and June, 1970, only 207 persons were
examined and 179 accepted, although a case load of 900 per year
had been anticipated. The main reason seems to be a general
disinterest by U.S. Attorneys.&quot; </p>

<p>Title II offers treatment in lieu of sentencing for addicts
convicted of federal crimes. This program is administered by the
Bureau of Prisons, which provides facilities for treatment within
regular penal institutions. The time of incarceration is not to
exceed ten years, and - the addict can be released to aftercare
services after six months. Only about 375 addicts are currently
being serviced under this title.30 </p>

<p>Title III provides for voluntary commitment by addicts who are
not involved in criminal proceedings. The commitment is for a
period of three years, most of which is spent in aftercare
facilities. The term of the institutionalization itself is to be
determined by the patient's progress but is not to exceed six
months. </p>

<p>Until recently, Title I and Title III patients were sent to
the Lexington or Fort Worth facility, under the Surgeon General.
(Fort Worth has now been transferred to the Bureau of Prisons and
will no longer be used for addiction treatment.) Title III
patients receive their initial evaluation at Lexington, but many
are channeled into community or state programs funded by NARA
grants and contracts. The Lexington facility is the most open of
the institutions and has a more relaxed policy toward escape or
attempted escape. The primary treatment methods employed are
detoxification, counseling, and some work and recreation therapy.
They have begun an experiment with a small therapeutic community
(Matrix House) but require a longer time commitment for patients
in this program. </p>

<p>The initial evaluation determines whether the addict is
suitable for treatment. The rejection rate is about 55-60 per
cent. The grounds for rejection are not clear. Some officials
claim that suitability is based on an assessment of
motivation-whether an addict has sufficient self-control to be
able to function in a relaxed and open environment, and, if not,
the availability of other types of treatment facilities. Another
view is that decisions on suitability are made on the basis of
objective criteria, such as current legal status, criminal
record, age, employment, history, prior drug experience, and
mental state. </p>

<p>In a study of the first 27 months of operation under the new
Act (1966-69), about 2,000 addicts were tested at Lexington. As
of September 30, 1969, there were 802 Title I and Title III
patients on an aftercare status; 26 per cent had been recommitted
to the institution for aftercare violations, and 5 per cent had
been discharged. As of March, 1971, 2,000 patients were in the
civil commitment program, of whom 1,300 were in aftercare. Of the
2,000, 60 per cent were white. Average age was in the late
20's.&quot; In June, 1971, the Director of NIMH stated: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In the civil commitment program, a study of 1,200 patients
    who were in aftercare in 1970 showed that approximately 85
    percent were employed, 70 percent were not arrested and spent
    no time in jail during that period, 35 percent were in
    self-help therapy, and 33 percent were pursuing their
    education. Patients who had been [in] aftercare for 3 months
    or more were, on the average, drug-free 80 percent of the
    time. A similar statement can be made regarding the heroin
    use of patients who were in the community treatment programs.
    As you know, many patients during the treatment of their
    addiction may abuse drugs other than heroin occasionally,
    such as cocaine, marijuana, amphetamines, or barbiturates. Of
    the patients in the civil commitment program who had been in
    aftercare for 3 months or more, 60 percent were not abusing
    any drugs. The same is true of patients who had been in the
    community treatment program for 3 months or more. Of the
    patients who are in the civil commitment aftercare phase, we
    know that 60 percent do not become readdicted during their
    first year in aftercare. Of the remaining, 25 percent do
    abuse some drugs or become readdicted and require further
    hospital treatment. About 15 percent were dropouts <font
    size="1">.32 <br>
    </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is difficult to know what to make of these results. Even
allowing for selectivity in acceptance into the program, they are
far better than the New York or the California experience would
have led one to expect. Since the detailed studies on which this
statement is based are not available, one can only reserve
judgment. </p>

<p>The Bureau of Prisons has analyzed initial results from its
care of inmates committed under Title II of NARA. As of the end
of 1971, 896 inmates had been examined for program eligibility,
and 70 per cent (630) had been accepted. The program had released
414 inmates to aftercare after an average institutionalization of
15 months, and 297 (72 per cent) of these were still active. The
other 28 per cent had &quot;violated or absconded.&quot; Over
five thousand months of &quot;successful aftercare&quot; had been
accumulated, but the meaning of that term as used in the report
is unclear.&quot; </p>

<p>Many drug experts believe that programs of civil commitment
offer little more than custodial care in a predominantly penal
setting. Counseling and therapy, when employed, are imposed on
the patients by the staff and are of questionable value.
Apparently, most addicts are committed as an alternative to
criminal prosecution or sentencing, and view commitment as such.
Most do not appear to be motivated toward inner change, and those
that do succeed might succeed equally as well in a voluntary
community program. In addition, civil commitment is expensive. It
requires secured facilities, around-the-clock guards, and large
staffs. (Cost estimates for all three of the large programs are
$10,000 to $12,000 per year per addict while the addict is in the
institution. It is not clear whether this represents full costs,
including capital expenditures, or operating costs only.) In
spite of these costs, the chief function of civil commitment
seems to be nothing more than to keep the addict out of
circulation for intermittent short periods. </p>

<p>The NARA information cited above seems to indicate that civil
commitment for a limited term followed by aftercare is more<br>
</p>

<p>promising than this conclusion suggests. The California
program was structured in somewhat the same manner-although with
a more open law-enforcement orientation-and it may be that it
shows worse results than NARA because it was more carefully
evaluated and the patients were more carefully controlled. A
definite answer to this will have to await more detailed
information on NARA. <br>
</p>

<p><font size="1">THE THERAPEUTIC COMMUNITY <br>
</font></p>

<p>&quot;Therapeutic community&quot; (TC) is a generic term used
to describe an institution that attempts to treat the addict by
dealing with the underlying causes of his addiction. The basic
concept of the TC modality, as of the civil-commitment programs,
is that addiction is the result of psychological problems, and
that intensive therapeutic techniques utilized within the
structure of a residential community can restructure the
character and personality of the addict to the point where he no
longer needs to use drugs. Although heroin addicts constitute the
major part of the TC population, most TC's service users of
nonopiates as well. As of mid-1970, there were probably 40-50
therapeutic community programs in the country with approximately
4,000-5,000 residents.&quot; </p>

<p>The growth of therapeutic communities is in some ways as much
a quasi-evangelical movement as a drug-treatment modality, and it
is difficult to describe them without distorting the views of at
least some of the participants.&quot; The flavor of this modality
can be partly conveyed by tracing some analogies and intellectual
roots. First, there is a parallel between the TC and Alcoholics
Anonymous. Synanon, the original addict-oriented TC, was founded
in 1959 by an ex-alcoholic as a treatment program for alcoholics
modeled after AA. It drifted into treatment of opiate addicts
largely by accident. Many of the TC's retain some of the basic AA
characteristics-the concept that there is no such thing as an
ex-addict, only an addict who is not using at the moment; the
emphasis on mutual support and aid; the distrust of mentalhealth
professionals; and the concept of continual confession and
catharsis. However, the TC has extended these notions to include
the concept of a live-in community with a rigid structure of
day-to-day behavior and a complex system of punishment and
rewards. </p>

<p>The rise of the TC also parallels the rising popularity of
group therapy generally. Encounter groups, support groups, and
marathon sessions are as prevalent in the &quot;straight
world&quot; as in the TC's, and the many differences in
group-therapy methods that exist outside exist in the TC's as
well. One reason for the frequent confusion about the different
TC's is that they reflect the many variations in approaches to
group therapy. </p>

<p>The growth of TC's has occurred at the same time as the growth
of interest in communes, and some TC's have an element of the
commune in them-the residents are rejecting a dishonest world in
favor of a better way of life. Synanon, for example, has
residents who have never been addicted to anything but who prefer
the Synanon life-style. Dr. John Kramer has referred to Synanon
as &quot;the third community,&quot; different from the drug-using
community and the &quot;square&quot; community. He points out
that there is a fundamental difference between Synanon and many
of the TC's in that &quot;the Synanon ideal is to retain members
in the group indefinitely and to expand steadily, drawing in more
and more members, squares as well as addicts. Other TC's differ
in that they do expect their members to re-enter the square
community. &quot;3r The past decade has seen a movement toward
community action and a rejection of services furnished
exogenously. Community control is a familiar slogan, and the
beliefs that only the poor know what the poor want and only
blacks can help blacks are also common. To some extent, TC's
reflect this movement. Many of them have adopted the view that
the nonaddict does not really understand the problems and world
of an addict and therefore cannot contribute as an ex-addict can.
Since addicts are often poor and black as well as addicted, this
concept is a powerful force. </p>

<p>Finally, the quasi-evangelical aspect of the TC creates an
interesting, although certainly not documented or provable,
situation. The addict may be replacing his addiction to heroin
with an &quot;addiction&quot; to being an ex-addict and to the
encounter therapy. The philosophy of the TC becomes a religion
for the addict. It is something to believe in and a message to
spread to his fellow addicts in the world. The &quot;religious
fervor&quot; involved exists in varying degrees. In Dr. Kramer's
words: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It has been undiplornatically stated that religiornania is
    a cure for narcomania. This observation is valid,
    particularly if one defines religiomania broadly as the
    devout acceptance of clearly defined tenets of a faith and
    its principles of behavior, and persistent participation in
    its prescribed rituals. The faith and its practice will
    usually encompass all the life activities of the communicant
    and in its practice he will have the opportunity for both
    penitence and ecstasy. Obedience is part of it as is the
    sense of being an accepted member of the congregation,
    however lowly, and thus possessing an attribute not possessed
    by anyone outside the sect. The requirements can be fulfilled
    not only by formal fundamentalist religious groups such as
    Teen Challenge but by such an organization as Synanon and
    other programs which have been modeled on it.37 <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In terms of structure and program, some common features of
TC's can be identified, despite wide individual variations. Most
have three identifiable phases to their program. The first of
these is a testing for admission; the addict must show the
genuineness of his desire to become drug-free. In some places,
the addict must become drug-free on his own and remain so for a
given period of time before he is admitted. In some, he must work
in a storefront center for a time, showing the proper attitude.
Others do not require abstinence in advance and will have a
patient detoxified on methadone or go through withdrawal after
formal admission. In some TC's, an addict is put through an
encounter session with present residents to test his dedication. </p>

<p>The methods vary, but at some point early in the process every
TC tests the candidate's motivation. As might be expected, there
is a high loss rate at this point, although numbers are difficult
to find. The different entrance procedures must be kept in mind
in evaluating TC's, because they can obviously make a substantial
difference in the statistical records of the program. A community
that does not formally admit addicts until they have passed
stringent tests is likely to show a higher success rate than a
community that does its weeding out after formal admission.<br>
</p>

<p>Whatever the form of testing used, relatively few addicts pass
it. In most TC's, somewhere between 50 per cent and 90 per cent
of the applicants are rejected or quit at this initial stage.
Once admitted, the addict enters a treatment ladder. The program
of treatment is usually highly structured and extremely rigid,
with an enforced system of rewards and punishments. The resident
starts at the very bottom of the ladder, with little freedom, no
responsibility, and the lowest types of tasks. As he proves
himself, he begins to acquire more freedom, better jobs, and
increased responsibility. This period of treatment lasts at least
a year and is characterized by clearly marked stages in status.
The emphasis is usually on confronting the addict with the
immaturity of his past behavior and his need to learn responsible
patterns of dealing with the world. Group therapy is emphasized,
and the encounters can be extremely rough. It is part of the
ethos, however, that the motives behind the encounters are
concern and love rather than hostility. </p>

<p>Finally, the resident arrives at the re-entry phase. During
this period, he begins to have a life outside the community
again-he takes educational courses, spends weekends with his
family, works, etc. When he has established a stable pattern
outside the community and is considered responsible by the
professional staff and/or peers, he may be discharged. (At
Synanon, there is no re-entry phase. Family life, education, and
work are all incorporated into the community. To Synanon
community members, the straight world outside the community has
not changed, and the pressures and problems that resulted in
their addiction in the first place are still there. Return to the
outside means return to heroin addiction, alcohol, or whatever
drove them in.) </p>

<p>A major problem in evaluating therapeutic communities is the
difficulty of ascertaining facts. Even a matter so rudimentary as
the costs involved is a matter of dispute because of differences
in calculating capital and operating costs, treatment of welfare
expenditures that go to support the community, allocation of
funds from different government agencies, appraisal of donated
goods and services, and simple lack of records. Costs range
anywhere from $3,000 to $10,000 per year per resident. </p>

<p>Even more difficult to assess is the result of the effort,
since little careful evaluation has been done. One multimodal
program analyzed the &quot;split rate&quot; from the TC component
of its program. They found that, of 122 entrants, 40 per cent
left within three weeks, 50 per cent within seven weeks, and 85
per cent within one year. A TC that appealed mainly to white,
middle-class residents found that, during one year, almost 700
persons entered the program, 535 left voluntarily, and 23 were
expelled. Of those who left, 175 came back. The program graduated
38 residents during the year. Of 113 graduates of the program
over a four-year period, 13 had relapsed to drug abuse. Of the
remaining 100 graduates, 25 were employed in the subject TC, 51
in other addiction programs, and 19 in the community at large;
five were unknown .18 These are only fragments, because there is
very little hard information on the results of TC's. In part this
is because evaluation is expensive and difficult and many
organizations do not have the money to spend on it. Also, some
program operators oppose evaluation on philosophical grounds-they
believe that what they are doing is humane and valuable and that
their work is demeaned by attempts to judge it in quantitative
terms. They may also believe that evaluation has negative effects
on the program. If it shows many failures the residents will come
to believe that they, too, will fail, and the prophecy will be
self-fulfilling. </p>

<p>Finally, there are sound bureaucratic reasons for avoiding
evaluation as much as possible. All the preliminary and anecdotal
indications are that, while a few people are helped greatly by
TC's, an overwhelming majority are not. In the hard competition
for government drug-treatment money, evaluation might well hurt
the TC's more than it would help them. The incentive to permit
evaluation, let alone fund it, is minimal. </p>

<p>Looking at all the available evidence and the impressions of
experts in the field, it is hard to escape the conclusion that
TC's are, at best, good for a very limited number of drug
addicts. As a rough guess, considering the initial rejection
rates, the split rates, and the relapse rate, it would be
surprising if careful evaluation showed that more than 5 per cent
of those who come into contact with the program are enabled to
lead a reasonably drugfree, socially productive life. </p>

<p>There is also a major question about the type of addict for
whom the TC is the proper solution. Some experts believe that the
TC works best for the sociopath who is tough enough to take the
encounters but not for those with less serious psychological
problems or those who are the least alienated. Other experts have
different categorizations. </p>

<p>The TC's may have advantages in dealing with particular
subgroups of addicts, however. Although exact population
breakdowns are seldom available, it is generally recognized that
the mean age of the residents is lower than that of either
addicts in the methadone programs or the total addict population.
This could mean that the TC is especially attractive to young
addicts, but this is not certain; the same result would ensue if
it were less attractive to older addicts. It may also be
effective with multidru'g users or with young experimenters, but
this has also been unproved. </p>

<p>In terms of any national program of treatment of heroin
addicts, it is difficult to see a major role for the TC, simply
because the success rate is too low and the cost too high to make
an important impact on the problem. At the same time, most drug
experts, when they discuss the necessary elements of a
comprehensive drug-treatment program, include a therapeutic
community, but whether this is based on a genuine belief in its
utility, on the hope that utility might be demonstrated, or on
simple politics is unclear. In the long run, it may turn out that
the TC is much more interesting outside the drug context than
within it. By setting itself the task of rehabilitating drug
addicts-a notoriously hard group to rehdbilitate-the TC movement
may have destined itself to look bad. The real contributions that
such methods might make to improvements in the condition and
functioning of more tractable populations are easily lost sight
of by appraisers who are concerned with the drug problem. <br>
</p>

<hr>

<p align="center"><font size="1">OUTPATIENT ABSTINENCE <br>
</font></p>

<p>Many programs have a component that treats outpatients and
attempts to get them to abstain from heroin use. Of 142 programs
covered by an NIMH survey, only 23 were for inpatients only, and
only 43 of the 142 engaged in methadone maintenance; therefore,
at least 76 were operating some form of outpatient abstinence
program. </p>

<p>These programs differ as much as or more than the therapeutic
communities. The major components are community outreach to find
people who need help; group and individual therapy of various
types; vocational and social counseling; intervention with
authorities, employers, or schools on behalf of the patient;
vocational training and education; and family counseling. The
programs emphasize these elements in varying degrees, of course,
and most probably do not offer a complete range of services.
Another variable is the intensity of the patient's involvement
with the treatment center. Some are halfway houses, where the
patient spends the whole day and goes home only at night. At the
other extreme are agencies that have only one or two sessions
with a patient or that are more or less social centers. Most
programs are, of course, between these extremes.&quot; </p>

<p>This method of treatment is not based on any constant
theoretical beliefs. Some people believe that addicts suffer from
underlying character disorders and can be changed only through
heavy involvement in therapy. Others believe that helping with
the immediate problems of the patient will enable him to help
himself. Still others are desperately trying to fend off the
total catastrophe that may overwhelm the patient if he does not
receive aid. </p>

<p>Very little evaluation of these programs has been done, and
there are no reliable data on the results. Most observers believe
that the attrition rates are very high, the number of patients
who remain drug-free is small, and the impact on such areas as
employment and criminal activity is minimal. Dr. Robert DuPont,
Director of the Washington, D.C., Narcotic Treatment Agency, has
found that only 15 per cent of the patients who selected NTA's
abstinence program remained in it for six months, although those
who did remain did well.&quot; A -D.C. Department of Corrections
study of the performance of abstinence patients in NTA facilities
(all of whom had been referred to NTA by the Department of
Corrections) came out with somewhat better results: 50 per cent
of 165 referees were failures after six months. If
&quot;escape&quot; was removed as a category of failure, then the
failure rate was only 25 per cent.&quot; Programs connected with
the criminal-justice system usually have the spur of return to
jail if the patient fails, of course. </p>

<p>The Office of Economic Opportunity enlisted a contractor to do
a thorough evaluation of eight OEO-funded projects; but the
data-collection problems were great, and it was impossible for
the evaluators to reach any meaningful judgments.&quot; OEO is
now trying again, but the results have not yet been published. </p>

<p>In general, the conclusions for these programs are about the
same as for the therapeutic communities and the detoxification
centers: They help a few people a great deal and more people to
some degree, but the failure rates are very high. They have a
considerable cost advantage over the therapeutic communities
because they do not need extensive and expensive residential
facilities. Their over-all, long-term contribution to the drug
problem is in some doubt. The major imponderable is the extent to
which changes in the addict population may invalidate pessimistic
conclusions drawn from past experience. Addiction may have spread
to people who are not so intractable as the groups on which these
conclusions are based. They might become abstinent with the help
that can be given by the outpatient facilities. </p>

<p>Most important is whether these programs have an impact on the
juvenile who is dabbling in the drug scene but has not yet become
a confirmed addict. This is the target population for many such
programs and would seem to be the area in which they have the
most to offer. At present, the answer is an enigma. Some of the
conclusions reached and questions raised in 1969 by Judith Calof
of New York's Community Service Society are still valid: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Voluntary treatment agencies have always emerged in
    response to the neglected needs of segments of the community.
    In the addiction field, there are still grave unmet needs.
    For one, the number of school-aged addicts has been growing,
    while voluntary and public agencies continue to concentrate
    on the older addict. Are special techniques needed for
    reaching and treating this young age group?... </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>A major unmet need is addiction prevention. Do voluntary
    treatment agencies have a major contribution to make in
    prevention? Could their coordinated efforts succeed in
    identifying and reaching those most vulnerable to this
    disease? </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The limited success of the voluntary treatment agencies
    should not be interpreted as failure, but should be viewed in
    long-range terms. Pioneering means trial and error, with
    inevitable setbacks and frustrations, but it reveals the
    assessment of a situation. Voluntary treatment agencies have
    already demonstrated the enormity of the addiction problem
    and the immense difficulties in rehabilitating heroin
    addicts. The results of their dedicated efforts should serve
    as a learning against unrealistic expectations. Their
    experience can prevent catastrophe in a massive government
    program, and refusal of the public to allocate further funds
    for treatment .43 <br>

<p align="center"><font size="1"><i>METHADONE MAINTENANCE <br>
</i></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">CHARACTERISTICS OF METHADONE<br>
</font></p>

<p>Methadone is a synthetic opiate. For purposes of understanding
its use in the treatment of heroin addiction, its most important
characteristics are as follows: </p>

<ul>
    <li>It is a substitute for heroin, in that it will prevent an
        addict from having or feeling withdrawal symptoms if he
        replaces his usual drug with methadone. </li>
    <li>Unlike the heroin available in this country, it is
        effective when taken orally. </li>
    <li>If the dosage is sufficient (the exact level depending on
        the addict's level of tolerance to heroin), the methadone
        will block the action of heroin, so that the addict
        receives no euphoric effect if he tries heroin. At lower
        doses, methadone will not block this effect of heroin,
        but it will suppress the &quot;narcotic
        hunger&quot;-described by Dr. Jerome Jaffe as a
        &quot;felt sense of physical abnormality&quot;-that an
        addict feels without his drug. </li>
    <li>The effective action of methadone is about 24 hours, as
        opposed to about six hours for heroin. Thus, it needs to
        be taken only once a day. </li>
    <li>When taken orally in constant doses, methadone does not
        produce a euphoric effect. </li>
    <li>To date, no significant deleterious side effects have
        been reported.<br>
    </li>
</ul>

<p align="center"><font size="1"><b>THE PROGRAMS</b></font> </p>

<p>Starting with a 1964 experimental project sponsored by the New
York Health Research Council and conducted by Drs. Vincent Dole
and Marie Nyswander, programs that maintain addicts on methadone
have grown steadily. Despite some differences in theory and
practice, in all maintenance programs an addict receives a dose
of methadone every day, either at a clinic or, if he has proved
himself, at home. He may also receive ancillary services-group or
individual therapy, individual or family counseling, vocational
rehabilitation, employment services, use of social center
facilities, and medical and dental care. The extent and quality
of these varies greatly, but almost all programs provide
something. </p>

<p>There are wide variations in the modes of operation of
methadone programs.&quot; For example, a study of 47 methadone
programs found that 27 programs used ex-addicts on the staff,
while the others did not; 6 had inpatients only, 19 had
outpatients only, and the rest had both. Only 8 of the 47
provided chemotherapy without any group work. </p>

<p>Table 3-1 lists the types of service offered by the 47
programs in terms of the numbers of programs and the per cent of
the total sample offering the service.<br>

<p>a Drug-free detoxification is not a feature of the methadone
program. <br>
</p>

<p>More detailed statements obtained from 25 of the methadone
maintenance programs showed that 14 favored narcotic-free
rehabilitation as the ultimate goal, and only 11 favored
prolonged maintenance. Also, 18 preferred high-dose
administration (50-180 mg.) and 7 preferred low-dose (20-40 mg.).
Not surprisingly, there was a correlation between preference for
narcotic free rehabilitation and preference for low doses. </p>

<p>The precise number of persons now in methadone-maintenance
programs is not known. At the Third National Methadone Conference
in November, 1970, Dr. Vincent Dole estimated that there were
then about 9,000 people on methadone maintenance in the United
States and Canada .4' This estimate was based on a<br>
variety of inputs, including discussions with the manufacturer of
methadone. It was in rough accord with the numbers of patients
recorded in publications by the major projects and was probably
fairly accurate. </p>

<p>Growth has been quite rapid, however. The NIMH treatment
directory listed 44 methadone-maintenance programs as of 1968-69,
and many of these had small patient populations. As of April,
1970, 64 programs had acquired or applied for Food and Drug
Agency authority to use methadone for maintenance, although not
all of them were in operation. At that time, the best estimates
were that between 50 and 60 programs were actually
operating.&quot; By June 1, 1971, the FDA had given permission to
257 sponsors representing 277 methadone-treatment programs, some
of which included several clinics. Of these, 185 programs were in
institutions and the other 92 were private. The number of
programs now in actual operation is not known.&quot; </p>

<p>The FDA estimated, in June, 1971, that there were 20,000 to
30,000 people on methadone maintenance at that time. Dr. Bertram
Brown Director of NIMH, testified at the same hearings that
20,000 was probably the best estimate.&quot; As of December,
1971, the FDA has doubled its estimate again. It now believes,
according to Dr. Elmer Gardner, that there are between 40,000 and
50,000 patients on methadone maintenance. </p>

<p>Costs. Costs of methadone programs are hard to determine. Many
figures are given, but it is never clear whether all costs (such
as plant and equipment or the value of volunteer help, for
example) are included. As a rough estimate, the cost of the
programs is between $500 and $2,500 per patient per year,
depending on a number of factors. </p>

<p>Methadone itself is not an important cost, since it can be
procured for about $.05 per day per addict. </p>

<p>Controlling and administering the methadone is a significant
cost, since it requires a staff. </p>

<p>Determination and preparation of individual doses are
significant, since determination requires physician time,
preparation requires careful work by a pharmacist, and keeping
track of individual doses takes staff time. Whether individual
doses are more effective therapeutically than standardized ones
is an open question. </p>

<p>All programs use urinalysis to test the patients' use of
heroin and other drugs. This costs $1 to $3 per test, depending
on the frequency, the laboratory, and the number of samples
tested. Obviously, this is a significant cost element: Testing
three times a week at $3 per test would cost $468 per addict per
year. There are some ways of avoiding these costs through random
testing, which is effective for some purposes. There may also be
cost-reduction possibilities for the tests themselves. </p>

<p>The method by which an addict is initially switched from
heroin to methadone makes a large cost difference. If the addict
is switched to methadone as an inpatient in a hospital (as was
done for most of the patients in the Dole-Nyswander project, for
example), each addict admitted may cause $200 to $1,400 for
initial hospital expenses. </p>

<p>Physical plant and facilities obviously make a difference in
costs. </p>

<p>Legal requirements are important. To the extent that
jurisdictional law requires that elaborate information be
obtained and records kept, the costs are increased. </p>

<p>Any research component adds expenses. </p>

<p>The level of ancillary services is important. An effort to
supply group therapy, counseling, vocational or educational
rehabilitation, and other services-all of which require high
staff-to-patient ratios-will increase expenses substantially.
Many of the public statements on costs regard this as the major
variable involved. While most programs pay lip service to the
need for these services, careful evaluation of the extent to
which they influence the success or failure of the program is
only beginning. </p>

<p>The rate of expansion of a program makes a significant
difference in average cost. An addict will probably require more
services and control in his first year than later, when he is
stabilized in a new life-style, so that a new or expanding
program should show higher average costs than a static one. </p>

<p>These variations account for the wide range of the basic cost
estimate. At present, $500 per addict per year seems about the
minimum for a program that uses standardized dosages, outpatient
induction, fairly cheap urinalysis, and no services except those
supplied by the addicts themselves. A reasonable estimate for a
program with individual doses, some inpatient induction, frequent
and expensive urinalysis, and many ancillary services is $2,000,
although, of course, the cost for each patient stabilized in the
program would be much lower.&quot; This figure could be raised
almost without limit by the provision of more extras, of course,
a phenomenon sometimes referred to by program operators as the
danger of &quot;Taj Mahalism&quot;---providing very elaborate
services to a few addicts rather than minimal effective services
to many. </p>

<p><i>Population Characteristics.</i> Because of regional
differences the demographic characteristics of the over-all
methadone population are hard to describe. The patient population
of the Methadone Maintenance Treatment Program (MMTP) in New York
City, for example, is about 40 per cent black, 19 per cent Puerto
Rican, 40 per cent white, and I per cent Oriental. This breakdown
compares with the ethnic breakdown of the New York City Narcotic
Registry, which, as of December, 1969, was 47 per cent black, 27
per cent Puerto Rican, and 26 per cent white.&quot; The Santa
Clara County (California) Methadone Program reports a patient
population of 55 per cent Mexican American, 6 per cent black, and
39 per cent white.&quot; Other programs also exhibit ethnic
breakdowns' indicating that methadone maintenance appeals to
minority-group addicts. The Washington, D.C., program, for
example, is 95 per cent black.&quot; The ethnic composition of
any methadone project is probably not too dissimilar from that of
the local addict population of comparable age, although it may be
skewed slightly toward overrepresentation of white addicts. </p>

<p>Methadone has not had similar success in attracting younger
addicts. Although the minimal age required for admission to most
programs is 18, the mean age of the patient population is usually
between 30 and 35. In addition, the average length of addiction
for the patient population on methadone is 10 to 15 years,
although most programs require only two years, and some now
require only one. There are reports, however, that the mean and
median ages and length of addiction are now falling.&quot;
Unfortunately, no treatment method has been developed that
attracts the majority of young addicts. Most members of this
group do not seem to be sufficiently disenchanted with either the
life-style or the effect of heroin to seek treatment of any type,
or are as yet unconvinced that they are truly hooked. </p>

<p>Results. Most methadone programs have made an effort to
evaluate their effect on the patients. The criteria employed
usually follow those developed to evaluate the MMTP in New York
-remaining in the program, employment, freedom from drug use,
decrease in crime, and willingness to accept help for personal
problems. </p>

<p>The New York program is not only the largest but also the best
evaluated over time. Consistently, the evaluation committee,
headed by Dr. Frances Gearing of Columbia University's School of
Public Health and Administrative Medicine, has found the program
successful with a large percentage of the addicts. The findings
of the evaluation, as of October 31, 1970, are as follows: &quot;
</p>

<p>Population. Most of the patients had been selected under
criteria that required them to be 20 years old, have a five-year
history of addiction, display no serious psychiatric problems,
and have no addiction to drugs other than heroin. Although in
1969 the requirements were reduced to age 18 and two years of
addiction, this had little impact on the age distribution of the
treatment population because of the waiting time. The mean age at
admission remained about 33-higher than the 27.9 mean age of the
addicts on the New York City Register. Whites had a mean age at
admission of 31, blacks of 35, and Puerto Ricans of a year in
between. </p>

<p>Retention. A total of 4,376 patients had been admitted since
the inception of the program in 1964. Of this group, 3,485 (80
per cent) were still in treatment at the time of evaluation. The
others had left voluntarily or had been discharged because of
excessive use of other drugs or alcohol, death, incarceration, or
antisocial or generally uncooperative behavior. Of the 2,424
originally inducted on an inpatient basis, 74 per cent were still
enrolled. Of the 1,952 who had been admitted directly as
outpatients, 88 per cent were still enrolled. (This group had not
been in treatment as long as the others, since outpatient
induction was started only in 1968. They were also a selected
group.) </p>

<p>Special studies of three 500-patient cohorts have been done.
One of those covered the cohort for 21 months, one for 33 months,
and one for 48 months. About 23 per cent of each cohort had been
discharged by 21 months after admission, 34 per cent of two
cohorts by 33 months after admission, and 42 per cent of one
cohort by 48 months after admission. </p>

<p>As is shown by the cohort studies, the commonly cited
80per-cent success rate is misleading. The statistic includes a
large number of addicts who have been in the program for a
relatively short period and does not fully reflect the attrition
over time. For example, the total admissions, as of October 31,
1969, were 2,325. As of October 31, 1970, they were 4,376. Thus,
the data for the latter date included 2,051 patients who had been
in treatment for less than one year, and half or more of these
may have been in for six months or less. (The cohort studies show
that the attrition rate during the first six months is about 10
per cent, and over the first year it is about 16 per cent.)
Maintenance of the over-all average of 20 per cent attrition is
therefore dependent on continuing expansion of the program. </p>

<p>There is another side of this argument, however. MMTP has
fairly strict standards for behavior and drops people for
violation of those standards; a large proportion of those listed
as failures were therefore dropped by the program (they
themselves did not want to leave). A study of 138 terminations
found the following causes: 55 </p>

<p>Involuntary terminations 81.2% </p>

<p>Uncooperative behavior 17.4% </p>

<p>Antisocial behavior 7.2 </p>

<p>Unreachable psychopathology 7.2 </p>

<p>Drug abuse 8.7 </p>

<p>Alcohol abuse 10.9 </p>

<p>Arrested 15.2 </p>

<p>Medical disability 2.2 </p>

<p>Death 12.3 </p>

<p>Voluntary terminations 15.9 </p>

<p>Voluntary discharge 14.5 </p>

<p>Loss of contact 1.4 </p>

<p>Administrative terminations and unknown 2.9 </p>

<p>Administrative .7 </p>

<p>No information 2.2<br>
</p>

<p>One can question whether a methadone program should terminate
patients for all of the causes given. Even if the patient has
serious problems remaining, the program may have substantial
beneficial effects. One can argue that the only patients who
should be counted as failures are those who drop out voluntarily.
If this criterion is applied to the 500-patient cohort that had a
42 per cent attrition rate over 48 months, and if we assume that
only 15.9 per cent of these dropouts were voluntary, then only 34
of 210 dropouts would be counted as failures. By this standard,
the MMTP may claim that it has a ' t least partial success with
93.2 per cent of all addicts who are admitted to the program. </p>

<p>Again, this is not totally satisfactory, for several reasons.
For example, it is difficult to know how to categorize those who
die or are discharged for medical disability. Some of the
voluntary patients moved to programs in other cities. Some
patients who were expelled might have dropped out voluntarily at
a later time. Thus, 93.2 per cent may be unrealistically high.
But it does show that a 42 per cent termination rate over four
years probably understates the value of the program somewhat. </p>

<p>To sum up, if one adopts MMTP's own standards on the retaining
power of methadone, the common figure of 80 per cent success errs
on the high side. If, however, one argues that those standards
are too stringent, excluding too many patients who are receiving
worthwhile benefits from the program, the 80-percent figure may
be too low. (it should be noted that the same problems exist in
assessing the effects of nomnethadone programs. They are just
more obvious in this context.) </p>

<p>Employment. For the group that stayed in the program,
employment rose markedly. About 26 per cent of the men were
employed when they entered. This figure rose sharply to about 57
per cent and 66 per cent for those in the program six and twelve
months, respectively, and then rose more slowly to about 78 per
cent for those in the program for 48 months. Because of
attrition, this percentage rise represents a much smaller
absolute rise in employment. Out of a cohort of 100 entrants, 26
would be employed. After four years, 58 members of the cohort
would still be in the program, of whom 45 (78 per cent of the 58)
would be employed. So, out of any group of 100 entrants, only 45
would be employed after four years. </p>

<p>Criminal Activity. For the group that stayed in the program,
criminal activity apparently decreased. In the three years before
admission to the program, the methadone patients had 120 arrests
and 48 incarcerations for every 100 man-years. In the four years
after admission, they had 4.5 arrests and 1.0 incarcerations. </p>

<p>A group of detoxification patients studied for purposes of
comparison showed 131 arrests and 52 incarcerations per 100
person years in the three years prior to detoxification and 134
arrests and 63 incarcerations for the four years after
detoxification. A separate study of 912 patients admitted over a
four-and-a-half year period showed a 90-per-cent drop in criminal
convictions.&quot; </p>

<p>Drug Use. While most patients test the methadone blockage a
few times while on methadone, none had returned to regular heroin
usage while still in the program. About 8 per cent have problems
with chronic alcohol use and 10 per cent with continuing use of
amphetamines, cocaine, and barbiturates. </p>

<p>Fate of Dischargees. A Gearing Committee study of 281
expatients six months after discharge had the following findings:
</p>

<p><font size="2"><i>Left</i> <i>Discharged</i> <i>Total</i></font>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><i>voluntarily</i> <i>for cause</i> <i>discharge</i></font>

</p>

<p><font size="2">Total N (90) (472) (562) <br>
</font></p>

<p>Two other studies have produced similar results. </p>

<p>Previous evaluations of MMTP have been criticized on the
ground that the original selection criteria (since eased, as we
have noted) picked only those addicts most amenable to treatment.
Another criticism is that the ambulatory induction program has
required that the applicant have either a job or a family. This
may also select the strongest candidates. Finally, the fact that
there is a waiting period may also operate to select patients who
are most amenable to treatment. The Gearing evaluations through
1970 do not include any analysis of attrition rates from the
waiting list or any comparison of those who enter treatment and
those who drop off the list. </p>

<p>These criticisms seem at first glance to have weight. There
are several compelling arguments that they do not, however. Dr.
Carl Chambers, Research Director of the New York Narcotics
Addiction Control Commission, headed a study that utilized
single-factor analysis to compare patients who stayed in the
program and patients who did not. He found that continuing in the
program was not related in any statistically significant way to
the patient's sex, marital status, multiple abuse of drugs, abuse
of alcohol, ethnicity, education, age at onset of heroin use, or
number of prior treatments. Continuing in treatment was
marginally related to conviction history, in that there was a
significant difference between those with three or more
convictions and those with two or fewer. It was related to the
length of abuse of narcotics, in that 90 per cent of those who
had abused five or fewer years and only 77 per cent of those who
had abused more than five years remained in treatment for two
years. There was a relationship to the employment status of the
patient at time of admission-88 per cent of those who were
employed and 77 per cent of those who were not remained in
treatment for at least two years. The item with the greatest
predictive power was the number of convictions-the fewer the
number, the greater the chance of remaining in treatment.
Combinations of these characteristics do have some predictive
value. For example, the Chambers study concluded that a patient
with seven or more convictions who had no marketable employment
skills was least likely to remain in treatment two years (55.6
per cent of these did remain), and that a patient with few
convictions and no multiple drug or alcohol problems was most
likely to remain in treatment (95.8 per cent).&quot; </p>

<p>In short, the original admission criteria may exercise some
influence on the success rate as measured by retention, but it
seems to be minimal. Some admissions criteria, such as the four
years of addiction, would operate against success. Others, such
as freedom from severe psychiatric problems (which would probably
result in a higher percentage of employed addicts than the number
in the population at large), would operate in favor of success.
But none seems to be very important. </p>

<p>Some special studies indicate that problem groups of patients
do respond to methadone, although not quite so well as the normal
groups. Of 269 patients on probation or parole-a group that would
be especially difficult to work with-72 per cent remained in the
program in good standing.&quot; Even more convincing is the fact
that the Dole-Nyswander results have been replicated by reputable
researchers in other places. At the National Methadone
Conference, sponsored by NIMH and the National Association to
Prevent Addiction to Narcotics, a succession of researchers from
different parts of the country recited results comparable to,
though usually not quite so good as, those achieved by the Dole
Nyswander program. Results have been generally good no matter how
few the restrictions placed on patient characteristics.&quot; </p>

<p>Interpreting these reports is complicated by the fact that,
while the basic criteria remain fairly constant, there are
variations in the exact methodology of evaluation-in the extent
to which information from addicts is verified independently, in
the frequency of urinalysis, in the relations between the police
and the program (in some places, for example, the police may
cooperate with methadone treatment by not prosecuting addicts in
the program except for very serious crimes), in the sampling
techniques used, and in the definition of retention. In addition,
some programs use outside evaluation teams, and some rely on
internal information systems or on special studies done by their
own staff. At present, no two major programs have been thoroughly
evaluated by the same team of outside experts, although the
Columbia group that evaluated the MMTP will probably also
evaluate the Narcotics Treatment Agency in Washington, D.C. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, the basic consistency of results is quite
impressive. Although we may not yet know exactly how good
methadone maintenance is, its essential efficacy is as well
established as anything in this field can be. It is now generally
acknowledged that methadone is medically safe, acceptable to many
heroin addicts, effective, and administratively feasible for
large-scale programs.&quot; Clearly, methadone should not be
regarded as a miracle cure. The majority of program operators
believe that most addicts on methadone try heroin a few times,
partly out of curiosity as to whether the block works, partly
because of the desire for euphoria. Judging a program in terms of
whether an addict ever relapsed might well make it appear to be a
failure. Methadone addiction avoids the large swings and
demanding schedule of heroin addiction, thus making it easier for
an addict to hold a job and support his family, but it is likely
to take months for an addict to revamp his life-style into a new
pattern. Underlying psychological problems remain, except for
those caused by the demands of heroin addiction itself. Addicts
tend to abuse some other drugs, such as amphetamines and alcohol,
to about the same degree that they abused them while on
heroin.&quot; </p>

<p>From society's point of view, the most important of all the
evaluation criteria is remaining in the program. An addict who is
using methadone is not continuing either extensive heroin use or
heroin-seeking behavior, and his criminal behavior will probably
be reduced because he does not need the money to purchase the
drug. He is not spreading hepatitis contracted from infected
needles by selling his blood to hospitals.&quot; He is not trying
to sell heroin because he needs money for a fix. He is not
hanging out in a shooting gallery or on the street serving as a
role model for the neighborhood adolescents. And he is not
helping to provide the mass market for heroin that makes
investment in its importation and distribution economically
attractive despite the risks. It should be emphasized, however,
that the addict will still have the criminal skills he has
learned and may choose to use them to support himself. In such
case, the decrease in crime would be the difference between the
amount needed to support the habit and the addict and that needed
to support the addict alone. Some patients may continue to commit
crimes at the same level as before, using the extra money to
raise their standard of living or to build up a nest egg.
Criminal activity, according to several experts, declines slowly,
over a period of a year or more.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="1">BASIS FOR THE SUCCESS OF METHADONE </font></p>

<p>The expansion of methadone maintenance has been based on
empirical evidence of its utility, not upon any solid
understanding of the pharmacological reasons for its success.
While, obviously, this success is due to its nature as an opiate
and long-acting substitute for heroin, an understanding of the
nature of addiction itself is missing. It is not known whether
methadone is more effective than other modalities because
addiction has physiological components that only another opiate
can offset or because of factors rooted in the psychology of
addiction. </p>

<p>The issues concerning possible physiological components of
addiction can be stated succinctly: </p>

<p>Are some persons physiologically vulnerable to heroin, in the
sense that it causes physical changes in them that it does not
cause in &quot;normal&quot; people? </p>

<p>Are there inherent physiological factors that make some people
seek heroin-is there some pre-existing felt physical need that
does not exist in most people? </p>

<p>Does taking heroin cause a permanent or long-term
physiological change in the addict that makes him crave the drug
after he becomes abstinent? </p>

<p>Does heroin addiction create a physiological change that makes
an ex-addict particularly vulnerable to stress after he becomes
abstinent? </p>

<p>There is no clear answer to any of these questions. Yet, most
scientists would be inclined to think that the answers to at
least the first two are &quot;No.&quot; Dr. Vincent Dole, in the
past, has hypothesized that narcotics addicts may have an
inherent neurological vulnerability to the drug, but recently he
seems to have modified his view.&quot; The second two questions
are the subject of debate among experts. Dr. Dole does seem to
think that opiate addiction causes a metabolic change in the
addict that, in turn, causes drug hunger. Whether he thinks this
change is permanent or only fairly long lasting (i.e., well
beyond the period during which overt withdrawal symptoms are
present) is, however, unclear.&quot; In either event, giving
methadone to an addict, iti Dr. Dole's view, simply corrects the
metabolic imbalance that has already been caused by his heroin
addiction. In this sense, he believes the analogy between
methadone for an addict and insulin for a diabetic is valid.
Others are skeptical.&quot; </p>

<p>Dr. William Martin has hypothesized a more elaborate
physiological model. In his view, an opiate such as heroin or
methadone causes a metabolic change that makes the user more
vulnerable to stress.&quot; An addict may become abstinent, but
stress will trigger a physiological reaction that makes him crave
the drug again. Furthermore, this effect may increase with
continued or increased doses of opiates. Thus, when an addict is
maintained on a methadone dosage higher than his prior heroin
dosage, as is true in many programs, the underlying physical
problem is aggravated. This, in turn, makes it even less likely
that he will ever be able to become totally abstinent. Dr. Martin
is uncertain whether the opiate-induced change is reversible. </p>

<p>Which, if any, of these theories are correct is obviously an
important question. A finding that there is an inherent
neurological vulnerability or that addiction causes an
irreversible or long-term metabolic change that induces drug
hunger, either inherently or as a response to stress, would have
important consequences for law enforcement, treatment, education,
and research. </p>

<p>To reiterate, the metabolic theories are far from proved at
present. They may turn out to be wrong, or it may develop that
there is a physiological change that is reversible over a period
of months or years. Such a finding would pose very difficult
public policy problems, because methadone might be prolonging and
aggravating a physical condition that could be reversed if an
addict could endure abstinence from opiates for some period that,
in practice, most addicts cannot endure. </p>

<p>There are other hypotheses about the reasons for the success
of methadone maintenance that are alternatives or supplements to
the metabolic theory. Some of these are as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>To some extent, abstinence symptoms may be a conditioned
    response to environmental factors. In turn,
    self-administration of heroin is a conditioned response to
    the existence of these symptoms, in that for the addict it
    has been a successful way of eliminating them in the past.
    (There are reports, for example, of men who have been in
    prison and &quot;clean&quot; for years experiencing
    withdrawal symptoms upon return home.) By blocking the effect
    of heroin, methadone extinguishes the reinforcement for its
    self-administration <font size="1">.61 </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Heroin has a short duration of action and involves wide
emotional swings, from euphoria after administration to the
threshold of withdrawal six hours later. The rapidity of this
cycle forces a totally drug-oriented existence on the addict. If
he does not concentrate on procurement of the drug to the
exclusion of virtually everything else, he is not going to have
it when he needs it. Methadone, with its twenty-four-hour action
and gentler swings, allows the addict the luxury of thinking
about something besides drugs. </p>

<p>Methadone programs, with or without supporting services, gives
the addict a good deal of psychological support. The staff is
concerned with his well-being and is giving him a medicine in
which they have obvious confidence. Medical practice has long
known that this placebo effect is important. </p>

<p>Heroin addiction imposes a structure and purpose on the
addict's life-getting the drug. Daily visits to the methadone
clinic may provide comparable structure. </p>

<p>The life-style and personal associations of an addict provide
great pressures to relapse after a period of abstinence. An
abstinence program located where the addict will not live in the
future (e.g., Lexington) does nothing about this problem, because
the addict does not build up an alternative life-style and
alternative associations and will probably return to the old ones
after release. Methadone protects him from heroin while he builds
new patterns of behavior and loses touch with the addict culture.
In this view, after new patterns have been developed, it might be
possible to withdraw the addict from methadone because his
altered environment would not put pressure on him to relapse. </p>

<p>There is some evidence that a substantial number of addicts
-perhaps as many as one-third-&quot;mature out&quot; of addiction
when they reach their 30's and 40's. Some of the patients who do
well on methadone may come from this group.&quot; </p>

<p>Studies have indicated that monitoring an ex-addict is an
important factor in keeping him off drugs.&quot; The crucial
ingredient of methadone treatment may be not the methadone per se
but the urinalysis. Addiction to methadone is necessary only to
force the patient to come to the program. </p>

<p>At present, one can do little but note these differences; one
cannot know how these vary in validity for different addicts or
groups, or, in some cases, even how they could be researched. <br>
</p>

<p><font size="1"><b>ISSUES CONCERNING </b>METHADONE <br>
</font></p>

<p><i>Dosage Level. </i>The first question about dosage levels is
how much methadone should be given to an addict. Most people have
a general preference for administering the least amount
consistent with success. This is based partly on moral feelings
that one should give as little of an opiate as possible and
partly on a desire to minimize unknown side effects or metabolic
disruption. The problem is to determine this minimum level. </p>

<p>The general rule of thumb is that a daily dose of 100 mg. will
block any effect of heroin for almost all addicts. Most programs
administer a maximum of 180 mg., although a few may go as high as
300 mg. in selected cases. A program that administers 80 mg. or
more is probably aiming at a blockage dose. A lower dose will not
block the effect of heroin-an addict can achieve euphoria if he
tries. However, the lower dose will block the narcotic hunger and
thus remove some of the pressure for heroin use. For most
addicts, a dosage of 40 or 50 mg. is enough to eliminate this
craving, but an even lower dose may be enough if the addict has a
light habit. </p>

<p>In the early methadone programs, it was apparently assumed
that any addict who found that he could break the block would do
so, and that the higher, blocking doses were necessary. In the
last few years, some experiments have been made comparing the
efficacy of high and low doses. Dr. Avram. Goldstein, at the
Santa Clara County Program, maintained three groups of randomly
chosen addicts on blind doses of 30, 50, and 100 mg.,
respectively. (Blind dosage is not discussed with the patient,
who is not aware of how much he is receiving.) The addicts
receiving the lower doses did tend to use heroin more often
during the first month, but by the third month in treatment there
was no significant difference among the groups in either heroin
use or retention in the program.&quot; Dr. Jerome Jaffe, of the
Illinois Drug Abuse Program, has done similar research with
roughly equivalent results. For the first month or so, the
highdose group has a higher retention rate; thereafter, the two
groups do about the same in terms of retention, employment, and
arrest rates. Dr. William Weiland came to the same con clusions
after similar experiments in Philadelphia with groups of 52
patients on 50 mg. of methadone and 52 on 100 mg. for a period of
60 days.&quot; There are few dose-related side effects. </p>

<p>These results suggest that suppression of the narcotics hunger
may be more important than the blockage effect, at least for
motivated addicts. The results are only suggestive, however,
because the time spans involved in these experiments are limited,
and it is not known what the results of a more extended
experiment might be. The results might also be different if the
populations involved were younger or less motivated. Drs. Dole
and Goldstein, among others, regard these experiments as very
interesting. The low dose does mean that some addicts will drop
out in the initial stages who might have been retained with a
higher dose. In addition, it exposes the patient to the medical
risk of relapse. Given these known costs and risks, and given the
lack of any solid reason to believe that a 100-mg. dose is in
some way more harmful than 50 mg., some doctors are reluctant to
use a low dose. The major reason for doing so is that it
minimizes leakage into the community from patients who take their
methadone home, minimizes side effects, and safeguards somewhat
against unknown side effects or long-term effects. </p>

<p>Some programs use doses even smaller than those described
above, but none has been scientifically evaluated. Colonel Hassan
Jeru Ahmed, of the Blackman's Development Center in Washington,
D.C., claims to give a number of addicts as little as 5 mg. per
day with good success. Without controlled experiments, it is hard
to know whether his opinion is accurate. Theoretically, such a
dose might suppress the hunger in an addict with a very low
habit, or there might be some placebo effect involved. Since
Colonel Hassan's aim is abstinence rather than maintenance, this
might also be a method of slow detoxification. </p>

<p>A second issue about dosage involves expense. Most programs
have assumed that the specific dose should be tailored to the
individual addict and therefore give doses of anywhere from 25
mg. to 180 mg., depending on the individual. From the standpoint
of administrative efficiency, this is costly. To work with a few
standardized doses would allow programs to treat more addicts
with the same expenditure. Dr. Goldstein has done an experiment
to determine whether the individualized dose is really more
effective and has concluded that it is not.&quot; To test this,
he used a blind dosage procedure. (This procedure not only is
necessary for research on dosage but also has substantive
benefits as well. The most important of these may be that the
&quot;dosage game&quot; is part of the addict's life style of
&quot;conning,&quot; and eliminating it contributes to over-all
rehabilitation.) An initial dose of 30 mg., increased by 10 mg. a
day until final stabilization at 100 mg., was equally effective
for all patients. </p>

<p><i>Ancillary Services. </i>Most program operators declare that
ancillary services are a vital part of methadone treatment. Group
and individual therapy, job training, job placement, family
counseling, medical and dental care, and education are all
regarded as crucial to the process of helping addicts make the
adjustment to a new life-style once they have broken the heroin
habit. MMTP, for example, provides extensive services, which is
one reason the total cost is estimated at about $2,000 per year
per patient. (The cost for each patient who has finished the
induction stage is about $1,000 per year.) In its evaluation
reports on MMTP, the Gearing Committee always emphasizes the
importance of services.&quot; Dr. Jaffe, whose Illinois Drug
Abuse Program also offers services, agrees. In particular, he
believes that the techniques and group procedures developed in
therapeutic communities are helpful in stabilizing addicts on
methadone because they create an environment in which patients
not only can be relieved of narcotics hunger but also can begin
to develop attitudes that may be useful to them in achieving
social rehabilitation. </p>

<p>There are some programs that operate with a minimum of extras,
however, and their success rate does not seem markedly lower than
the others'. In New Orleans, most addicts are treated in private
clinics and pay about $10 per week.&quot; The program has limited
ability to finance additional facilities. The Santa Clara County
Program, which also operates at a cost of about $10 per addict
per week, is equally limited in its services.&quot; About 10 per
cent of the patients receive psychiatric help outside the
program, and there is some vocational counseling. There is also
some group work by the patients themselves without professional
involvement. Since the initial retention rate of the Santa Clara
County Program is relatively close to that of the MMTP,
additional ancillary services might contribute little as compared
with their costs. (An important aim of the program has been to
study this question.) The Santa Clara Program did include a
vocational counselor, which many observers feel is the most
important single service that can be offered. It also emphasizes
peer-group therapy as a key to rehabilitation.&quot; Drs. Jaffe
and Dole have experimented with giving methadone without services
to people on waiting lists. Preliminary results from MMTP are
good.&quot; </p>

<p>Although one could easily find widespread agreement that
ancillary services would be clearly desirable if they were free,
one seldom finds any explicit analysis of the cost/benefit
aspects of the issue. The key fact is that, as long as the supply
of addicts holds out, a minimal program can treat many more
patients than an elaborate one at any given level of expenditure.
A program costing $500 per year per addict, with a retention rate
of only 50 per cent, can treat more people than a program costing
$2,000, with an 85-per-cent success rate. With $1 million, for
example, the cheaper program could treat 2,000 addicts for a year
and would retain half of them. The more expensive one could treat
only 500 addicts, even though it would retain 425 of them. The
economic advantages of the cheaper program are even greater when
the comparative outputs are analyzed over time. Still, assuming a
limited budget and an unlimited supply of addicts (and, at
present, almost all methadone programs have waiting lists) , each
type of program will be losing its failures and retaining its
successes. After some period, each would have a success rate of
100 per cent, because only the successes would remain; but the
$500 program would be maintaining four times as many addicts for
the same amount of money. </p>

<p>This analysis holds even for gross differences in success
rates. Since, as New Orleans and Santa Clara show, the actual
differences may be limited, or even nonexistent, the case for the
cheaper program is even stronger. Any city with a large addiction
problem and limited funds should probably choose a methadone
program with minimal services rather than full ones. The
principal argument against this conclusion is that services might
make a crucial difference for the hard-core addicts, and that
this is the population that causes most of the crime. But, while
it is true that addicts with long criminal records are less
successful on methadone than are others, it has not yet been
proved that the services make a crucial difference for this
group. In addition, the proposition that society should condemn
four treatable people to addiction in order to treat one other
addict who is causing more trouble is a hard moral position to
defend. It might be better to put the hard-core addict on heroin
maintenance and treat the others with methadone. </p>

<p>Another argument sometimes used in support of extensive
services is that society should spend the money necessary to give
full treatment to all addicts, thus obviating the whole question
and avoiding the need for moral choices. In the practical world,
however, everyone knows that the cities are in financial trouble
and have tremendous demands on their limited resources. It is
neither possible nor desirable to give narcotics addicts a prior
claim to limited public resources that might otherwise be spent
on education, health, welfare, or countless other pressing areas.
The best model may be one in which the patients are encouraged to
develop their own services, with the expensive ancillary services
targeted on the hard-core. </p>

<p><i>Outpatient Induction. </i>The MMTP originally inducted
patients into the methadone program by putting them in the
hospital for a week or two during the transition from heroin to
methadone. Because this is expensive, and because the limited
number of available hospital beds imposes a constraint on the
number admitted to the program, there has been much interest in
ambulatory induction. Starting in 1968, MMTP has adopted such a
program for some of its patients. As of 1971, about 1,952 of its
4,376 patients had been admitted in this fashion. Preliminary
data indicate that rates of attrition are almost identical
whether patients are inducted as inpatients or outpatients. After
24 months, about 72 per cent of each group remains.&quot; This
figure is not entirely valid because of the special
characteristics of the ambulatory group. Having a job or family
was a requirement for admission to the ambulatory component, and
79 per cent of admittees were employed or in school. Whether a
patient is employed, as we have seen, is a statistically
significant predictor of whether he will remain in treatment. </p>

<p>Other programs have also used ambulatory admission with
consistently good results, and the effectiveness of this method
is no longer in doubt.&quot; </p>

<p><i>Withdrawal. </i>Eventual withdrawal from methadone rather
than perpetual maintenance is regarded as a goal by drug experts
-in part because of a moral feeling that people should not and do
not need to be drug-dependent; in part because of a desire to
free the addict from his ties to the clinic; in part because of
the wish to minimize any unknown long-term effects of opiates on
the human body. </p>

<p>At present, it is uncertain whether withdrawal is possible. In
a study of 350 patients who withdrew from the MMTP, Dr. Dole
found that &quot;narcotics hunger&quot; returned in almost all
individuals immediately after they ceased taking the methadone,
whether their withdrawal was voluntary or involuntary. Since this
is a somewhat special populations high proportion were treatment
failures-the results are not conclusive, although they are
suggestive that withdrawal may be difficult. Dr. Dole has also
found in blind experiments that a patient stabilized on methadone
and free from drug hunger may have a return of drug dreams if his
medication is withdrawn. He believes that, for most addicts,
maintenance has to be a permanent way of life. It is important to
note, however, that the return of &quot;narcotics hunger&quot;
does not automatically mean a return to heroin use; some
individuals are able to live with the hunger without returning to
drugs. But hunger does make successful abstinence substantially
more difficult.&quot;' </p>

<p>Dr. Jaffe believes that withdrawal from methadone can be
successfully accomplished, although his work in this area has not
yet been extensive. In a study of 53 patients in active
treatment, he found that 29 per cent had voluntarily withdrawn
from methadone but remained affiliated with the methadone units,
either participating in group therapy or transferring to
therapeutic communities or aftercare systems. Not all those
observed on withdrawal remained abstinent, although some patients
observed after six months had been able to do so. Dr. Jaffe seems
to feel that continued therapy techniques are helpful in
maintaining abstinence.&quot; </p>

<p>Dr. Avram Goldstein has done experiments showing that the
methadone dosage can be reduced without discomfort to the patient
if it is done slowly at a weekly reduction rate of no more than
10 per cent. Withdrawal from a moderate methadone stabilization
program would then require about six months.&quot; But follow-up
results are not yet in. </p>

<p>Although the results to date are ambiguous, it seems certain
that substantial experimentation with withdrawal from methadone
will be undertaken. Some black activists, in particular, are
strongly opposed to the concept of permanent maintenance and will
accept methadone programs in their communities only if they are
seen as intermediate-term therapies with the ultimate goal of
abstinence. Dr. Beny Primm, of Addiction Research Treatment
Corporation in New York City, for example, told us that his
explicit goal is to get everyone off methadone and into a
drug-free state. Dr. Goldstein has also suggested that methadone
treatment should be thought of as &quot;methadone temporary
support rather than methadone maintenance, with its implication
of life-long medication.&quot; An addict could join the program,
become stabilized on methadone, eventually taper off slowly and
become drug-free, but be able to return to methadone if the urge
to take heroin became overwhelming.&quot; Ultimate determination
of the possibilities of withdrawal must await determination of
the metabolic-change issue. Meanwhile, the only way to find out
if withdrawal is possible is to try it. Since we do not know why
methadone works, there is no way of telling <i>a priori. </i>Some
programs have reported an unexpected phenomenon that might be
called &quot;the 20-mg. barrier.&quot; The patient undergoing
withdrawal does well until the dose is reduced to about 20 mg. At
this level, there is a sudden increase in physical complaints and
heroin usage.&quot; What this means for permanent withdrawal is a
question that needs study. </p>

<p><i>Benefits to the Addict. </i>Methadone maintenance is
sometimes criticized on the ground that it is society's way of
dealing with the addict crime problem without regard to the
addict himself. This view is especially strong among so-called
militant black groups. On the whole, however, the idea that
methadone sacrifices the addict for the sake of society does not
seem valid. Although many communities adopt methadone programs in
an attempt to solve their crime problem, the program results
showing increased productivity and family stability of the
patients suggest that they themselves benefit from the changed
life-style and reduced crime as much as or more than the
community at large. Since most programs operate primarily on a
voluntary basis, the patients themselves must prefer methadone to
the addicted life. Even when an addict is coerced into treatment
by law enforcement, simply staying in treatment is a vote against
the former life-style. </p>

<p>Finally, even if one were to concede the truth of the
criticism, the logical rejoinder would be &quot;So what?&quot;
There is no good reason for society to tolerate crime simply
because the criminal is a heroin addict when it can eliminate the
crime by forcing him to switch to being a methadone addict. It is
not as if one could choose between methadone and an equally
effective but more expensive alternative: The other alternatives
do not appear to work so well. Even if they did, it would be
difficult to argue that addicts deserve priority in allocating
scarce public resources that could be devoted to the general
welfare of the groups in society that furnish most of the
addicts. In general, to the extent that the criticism represents
the truth of the situation, its use as a criticism seems based on
wishful thinking rather than sound analysis. Its proponents wish
there were another, equally effective treatment method or wish
that public resources were unlimited. </p>

<p>If the metabolic theories of addiction should prove accurate,
the issue will become more acute. Dr. William Martin, for
example, poses the issue as the &quot;medical dilemma of
methadone maintenance, namely, the creation or continuance of a
serious medical disorder, physical dependence, in order to
decrease antisocial behavior.&quot;&quot; If this dilemma is a
real one, all the choices would be unpleasant. The nation could
legalize heroin or move to a massive system of heroin
maintenance, but this would pose exactly the same moral problems
as administering methadone. It could continue to keep heroin
illegal and prosecute addicts for crimes committed to obtain it
while refusing them methadone, but this seems both morally wrong
and politically impossible. It could declare that addicts are not
responsible for crimes committed to obtain heroin because of the
physical duress involved. This would necessitate either heroin or
methadone maintenance, however, since no one can be given such a
license to steal without some counteraction by society. Despite
the problems stated by Dr. Martin, methadone seems the best
choice. </p>

<p><i>Methadone and the Law-Enforcement System. </i>Some program
operators are strongly opposed to the development of close
relations between methadone maintenance and the law-enforcement
system. In their view, a coercive system that forces an addict to
accept methadone as a condition for probation or parole is an
intolerable violation of civil liberties. Others, with equally
strong opinions, disagree. They believe that the realistic choice
lies between having the addict on methadone and having him in
jail, and that the authorities will not often impose a methadone
requirement on a man who would otherwise have been released. In
this view, accepting treatment set by courts or parole boards
gives addicts an option that would not have been available
otherwise. All agree that participants in the methadone program
should avoid becoming informers for the law-enforcement system.
Because of the need to maintain the confidential doctor-patient
relationship, patients should not be reported by the treatment
agency for violations of probation or parole. </p>

<p><i>Methadone and Causes of Addiction. </i>Addiction is often
seen as a sociopsychological disorder, stemming from basic
personality defects. In this view, it is useless and wrong to
treat addiction by administering methadone without, at the same
time, treating the underlying disorder. A better way to approach
the problem is to deal with the basic pathology; when this is
done, freedom from drug use will follow naturally. As stated by a
Manhattan probation officer: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>My<b> </b>objection to the methadone program . . . is
    predicated on the observation that while the drug methadone
    removes the physical craving for the other opiates it
    nevertheless fails to combat in any way or deal with the
    various emotional or other difficulties that permitted the
    individual to initially become and remain involved with
    drugs. Since the drug problem has, so to speak, been
    eliminated, that basic problem has not been dealt with; that
    of the inadequate, ineffective person unable to cope with the
    reality of his situation. In essence, an aspect, the symptom,
    has been treated not the entire individual, with the result
    that they then frequently resort to other avenues of escape
    including amphetamines, barbiturates, wines, and liquor, or
    they begin to manifest serious forms of instability.88<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most proponents of methadone would readily agree that
methadone <i>per se </i>does not cure any personality disorders
that might cause addiction. (Not all would; it is entirely
possible that the opiates constitute an effective treatment for
certain as yet undefined psychic states.&quot;) Those who do
agree would respond to the basic criticism as follows: </p>

<p>No consistent pathology has been found. No psychiatric
diagnosis can be shown to apply to all heroin addicts or even to
a majority of them. Thus, while addicts tend to be depressive,
they are not so depressive as neurotic nonaddicts. While some
addicts are schizophrenic, 80 per cent to 90 per cent are not.
Some are psychopathic, but the great majority are not. In short,
no satisfactory explanation of the psychological roots of
addiction has been found, much less developed to the point where
it is operationally useful for treatment purposes's </p>

<p>The view that an underlying pathology is responsible is an
assumption rather than a proved fact. One can construct equally
plausible theories that experimentation is caused by exposure and
normal psychological processes, and addiction is caused by
physiological factors. Dr. Dole, for example, believes that the
observed common characteristics of addicts are simply those
forced on them by the nature of the life-style required to
maintain a heroin habit. Other experts also believe that, even
for addicts with marked problems, it is the addiction that causes
the problems rather than vice versa. </p>

<p>Even granting the argument that pathology is at the root of
addiction, it is easier to work on underlying causes with an
addict who is on methadone and free of drug hunger and the heroin
life-style. </p>

<p>Again granting the argument that pathology is at the root of
addiction, the success rates in attempting to cure such
pathologies-especially among the socioeconomic groups that
furnish most of the addicts-are not very high. Thus, one has no
realistic choice except to accept the second best solution of
methadone maintenance, which has very great benefits for society
and for the addict, even though it is not a complete cure. </p>

<p>Perhaps the best summary has been given by Dr. John Kramer,
discussing the psychopathology of addiction generally, not just
methadone: </p>

<p>It is generally conceded that traditional psychiatric
techniques have not been useful in the management of opiate
dependence. In a psychoanalytic frame of reference symptoms are
considered to be the behavioral or somatic representations of an
underlying intrapsychic conflict. Once the conflict is resolved
or reduced to manageable proportions, the symptoms will diminish
or disappear. </p>

<p>This conceptual model fails to account for two different
issues, either or both of which may play a role in people who
abuse drugs. First, though intrapsychic determinants may play a
part in whether a person uses drugs, other circumstances such as
drug availability, subgroup attitudes, peer pressures, and plain
chance are very often more important. In other words, in some
individuals, there may be no serious underlying conflicts, though
there may be considerable conflict with the community. Second,
whatever the original determinants of drug use may be, the
symptom, dependency on drugs, can become so central an issue that
it, so to speak, assumes a life of its own, and even solving the
underlying conflicts may have no influence on the drug dependence
itself. An analogy may be drawn with a depressed person who in an
attempt at suicide breaks his neck and becomes paraplegic.
Psychotherapy may relieve his depression but will not restore
function to his legs. </p>

<p>Because drug use has been invested with such great importance
in our society (an importance it did not always have) it is
assumed that the intrapsychic events which cause, or contribute
to it, are of equal magnitude. Hence the view, that since drug
use potentially subjects the person to such serious consequences,
the psychological problem he has must be equally big. Experience
with drug users does not validate this view. Some do indeed have
clearly definable psychiatric problems, but many do not. Where it
is sought, some subtle psychiatric defect can always be found, as
has been the case with addicts. Further investigation may clarify
this question. In the meantime a functional approach, handling
the symptoms, educating and giving practical assistance as well
as offering psychotherapy in selected instances seem desirable.91
<br>
</p>

<p>Multiple Drug Use. If a heroin addict is involved in the use
of other drugs, methadone will do nothing about that use. There
is evidence, however, that methadone patients do not increase
their use of other drugs-a charge that has been made-although
they do tend to maintain it at about the same level. The Santa
Clara County Program found that, both before and after going on
methadone, about 20 per cent of the patients overused alcohol, 5
to 10 per cent used amphetamines, 45 per cent used marijuana, and
30 per cent used nothing. The only significant difference was
that 20 per cent abused barbiturates before going on methadone,
and only 6 per cent did so afterwards.&quot; Since barbiturates
create a dangerous addiction if used too much, this is an
important shift. </p>

<p>We know of no other before-and-after study of drug use by
patients on methadone. A recent study of multiple drug use by
heroin users, however,&quot; supports Dr. Goldstein's conclusion
that the use of other drugs does not increase. A sample of 422
heroin users were asked whether they had used certain drugs more
than six times. The per cent who had done so were: marijuana-86
per cent; cocaine-47 per cent; barbiturates-34 per cent; and
amphetamines-33 per cent. (They were also questioned about other
drugs, not recounted here.) In general, it had not been thought
that multiple use among heroin addicts was as high as this, and
there may have been some tendency to assume that multiple use
among methadone patients was a new pattern for them rather than
the continuation of an old one. </p>

<p>Leakage of Methadone. As more large methadone projects come
into existence, it is reasonable to anticipate that some of them
will be lax in their control of methadone, permitting leakage
into the community at large. Several possible consequences of
such a development cause concern. First, there is a fear that the
drug will become available in an injectable form that is an
acceptable, if not a totally satisfactory, euphoric substitute
for heroin. Secondly, the availability of even oral methadone
will create a new group of addicts. Thirdly, nonaddicts,
particularly children, may take methadone and die. </p>

<p>These fears have a sound factual basis. Indeed, methadone can
already be bought on the street in any major city, although it is
unclear whether the source is diversion from the programs or
independent manufacture. The major concern is injectable
methadone. Many addicts regard it as a very good drug, and it
could result in a substantial addition to the present addiction
problem. This is probably a controllable problem, however.
Methadone can be mixed with Tang or some other substance before
dispensation (as is true in almost all programs at present), so
that it is suitable for oral administration only. More important,
the drug companies have developed a methadone disk that requires
a large volume of water for it to dissolve. This makes it
difficult, although not impossible, to inject.&quot; </p>

<p>The second concern, the leakage of oral methadone, is more
crucial. The rapid expansion of methadone programs is highly
probable. With this will inevitably come carelessness about staff
and about control of methadone. If there is a market for the
drug, there will also be some corruption. It will be surprising
if there are not some major scandals involving the diversion of
methadone from treatment programs. </p>

<p>In some ways, leakage may not be very important. While there
are some methadone addicts who are not involved in treatment
programs, oral methadone is not so euphoric as heroin, and few
current heroin addicts would prefer it to heroin as a
euphorogenic. </p>

<p>There is no reason to believe that methadone addiction is
physically more harmful than heroin addiction, and, if the
methadone is pure, there is good reason to think it less harmful.
There is substantial evidence to the effect that methadone
addiction is psychologically less harmful than heroin addiction.
In general, while a few addicts might make oral methadone their
drug of choice, it is probable that the major market for illegal
methadone will consist of addicts who are on do-it-yourself
methadone maintenance, who tide themselves over with methadone
when they cannot get heroin, or who want the euphoric effects of
heroin only occasionally. In these cases, both society and the
addict are better off if they can get methadone to substitute for
heroin. </p>

<p>There is some possibility that methadone will make addicts of
persons who would not otherwise have become addicted. Heroin has
two major defects that may exert some deterrent effect on
potential experimenters: It often contains dangerous impurities;
and it is not effective when taken orally. On the whole, however,
it seems unlikely that these factors are very influential. For
those who might not like to inject a drug, heroin can also be
snorted. (This is, in fact, the usual method by which neophytes
take the drug.) The impurities point might be valid, but it is
difficult to believe that anyone willing to get into the general
life-style of addiction is going to be deterred by the marginal
additional disadvantage of impure drugs. It does seem likely,
however, that, as methadone becomes increasingly available, it
will be used as the drug of initiation by persons who would
otherwise have tried heroin. </p>

<p>More difficult to accept are the overdose deaths that are
already starting to occur-most poignantly, among children who
find and drink methadone-laden Tang. Recurrences could be
prevented by insisting that methadone patients keep methadone in
a locked box outside the refrigerator. The drug will keep a week
without refrigeration, so that this is perfectly feasible.&quot;
Noninjectible methadone could also be given in a tablet form that
is too large and bitter for children. </p>

<p>Other deaths occur among people who use methadone to achieve
euphoria. Because methadone is slower-acting and longer lasting
than intravenous heroin, even a veteran heroin addict may take
methadone, decide that the drug is not having an adequate effect,
take more, and overdose when the peak comes two or three hours
later. Self-education within the drug subculture might keep such
incidents to a minimum. But some deaths will occur, and it is
reasonable to expect that the more methadone available, the more
deaths it will cause. </p>

<p>The only effective answer to this argument is to point to the
large number of heroin deaths caused by overdose, disease, and
infection and to the other deaths caused by addict-committed
crime and by such practices as the sale of infected blood by
addicts. Almost certainly there will be an over-all decrease in
opiate-related deaths as methadone replaces heroin in the
community. </p>

<p><i>Side Effects.&quot; </i>A number of possibly undesirable
side effects of methadone have been hypothesized, ranging from
impotence to damage to the bones and teeth. So far, clinical
studies have found no evidence of birth defects and no indication
of physical damage. Drowsiness is a frequent complaint of program
initiates, but this is a natural consequence of an increase in
the opiate dose and disappears as the addict develops tolerance
for the new level. Some addicts continue to complain of the loss
of libido, but the best evidence is that, for most, sexual
performance is better when they are on methadone than when they
are on heroin. In short, although it cannot be stated
categorically that there are no serious side effects, clinical
investigation so far has failed to find any. To date, however,
research has concentrated on possible physical effects; there do
not seem to be detailed studies of the effects of methadone on
intellectual or motor functioning, and we do not know how
methadone affects a wide range of important functions, from
problem-solving ability to the ability to operate a car or often
complex machinery. Since methadone is a powerful tranquilizer, it
may well have effects in these areas. It is also possible that
tolerance to tranquilization develops, as may be indicated by the
disappearance of excessive drowsiness.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="1">THE FUTURE OF METHADONE </font></p>

<p>It is virtually certain that methadone maintenance will
increase rapidly in the next few years. While many observers have
reservations, the cost/benefit and cost/effectiveness advantages
of methadone have become obvious. Since the relationship between
addiction and crime has been widely publicized, political
pressures to do something about crime are great enough so that
the government will probably support methadone, and vigorously. </p>

<p>While the federal subbureaucracies involved-the National
Institute of Mental Health, the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous
Drugs, and the Food and Drug Administration-have never been fond
of methadone maintenance, its social and political advantages
should now be obvious enough to induce large scale federal
funding in the near future. Most informed observers regard the
Administration's proposal to create a Special Action Office on
Drug Abuse Prevention and to increase funding dramatically as
confirmation of this. At this writing, the Food and Drug
Administration is on the verge of liberalizing the rules under
which methadone is approved for use. </p>

<p>As the programs expand, several issues in addition to those
already discussed will become important: </p>

<p><i>Administrative Problems. </i>There are clear differences
between operating small, experimental programs and operating mass
programs. Such issues as the extent to which ancillary services
should be supplied, the extent of monitoring through urinalysis,
high doses versus low doses, standardized doses versus individual
ones, and control of leakage will arise over and over. In
addition, there will be the problems of recruiting and training
staff common to any expanding area. At present, there are not
enough people experienced in methadone programs to double or
triple current programs. One can expect a period of raiding of
existing programs (with a consequent decline in their
effectiveness) and increasing use of less qualified and less
dedicated people. The difficulties of hiring good staff will
compound the leakage problem. It will also create pressures to
use the cheapest methods available. Most of the higher costs of
the more expensive programs are caused by the increased staff
required for added services; if the trained staff to provide
these services is simply not available, they either will not be
provided or will be done poorly. Analysis of the impact of these
services is therefore urgent. </p>

<p><i>Community Problems. </i>As noted, some black militants are
opposed to methadone maintenance because they regard it as a
device to keep the black community &quot;drugged and
enslaved.&quot; Many of the rumors of side effects are also
believed. These fears can be countered as long as there appears
to be a possibility that methadone maintenance leads to
abstinence; but, if experiments indicate that this is not a
reasonable hope, the situation may become more difficult. This is
not the type of problem that is amenable to rational solution, or
even advice. Methadone-program operators, however, can do at
least three things to meet the challenge: </p>

<p>1. Maintain close contact with various elements of the
community, to explain what they are doing and why it is good for
the addict and the community. </p>

<p>2. Provide facilities to ensure that any methadone patient who
wants to try to become totally drug-free will receive the best
possible support for his effort. </p>

<p>3. Involve the community in the staffing and administration of
the project. </p>

<p>Since these are all good policies irrespective of any militant
reaction against methadone, programs should follow them whether
or not they foresee any problem. Some program operators believe
that the fear of adverse community reaction is exaggerated and is
likely to decrease over time. The area in which the addict lives,
after all, bears the crime costs and the risk of a spread in
addiction. As a methadone program becomes operational, the
surrounding community comes to appreciate it, and strong
opposition dissolves. Dr. Robert DuPont, of Washington's Narcotic
Treatment Agency, has told us that methadone patients become the
best missionaries in the community. </p>

<p><i>Long-acting Methadone. </i>The effect of the methadone used
at present lasts only about 24 hours. Drug companies have been
experimenting with a drug (acetylmethadol) that will last up to
three days, and it is expected that this will become generally
available soon.&quot; This will have several significant effects
on methadone maintenance. It will cut costs by reducing the
expense of preparing and administering the drug. It will also
make it more difficult for the patient to skip his dose and try
heroin. Another effect may be to allow the patient greater
mobility and weaken the ties between the patient and the program.
In the view of some, this will be a good thing because it will
enable the patients to lead a more nearly normal life. Others
speculate that it will be counterproductive, in that the routine
daily visit provides an important element of structure in the
patient's life and has positive therapeutic benefits. There is no
way of resolving this dispute <i>a priori.</i> </p>

<p><i>Changing Patterns of Addiction. </i>There is consensus that
the primary reason addicts volunteer for methadone programs, or
stay in them once assigned by the law-enforcement system, is that
they are tired of the life-style of an addict, with the constant
need to make a connection, the strains of criminality, the jail
time, and the risk of infection and death. Participation in a
methadone program and abstinence from heroin become a more
attractive choice. Whether he procures methadone on the street or
through a clinic, as long as it is cheap he can maintain his
opiate habit at low cost and then occasionally obtain the desired
euphoria by skipping the methadone and using large amounts of
heroin. Since the data from existing programs indicate that many
addicts do use heroin occasionally-anywhere from 10 to 50 per
cent, depending on the program and length of time in
treatment-this may already be a common pattern. </p>

<p>This problem presents a difficult choice to program operators.
To eliminate this last increment of drug use might require
expulsion of addicts for occasional heroin use. This would
certainly return some patients to the addicted life, with all the
social and personal costs involved. If an addict is adjusting
well in other ways, this cost is not justifiable. Eliminating the
last vestige of heroin use in such a case is essentially a
meaningless concession to moralism. </p>

<p>There is a more serious question involved, however. There is
no way of knowing the extent to which the negative aspects of the
addicted life have a general deterrent effect that keeps people
from experimenting with heroin. Clearly, almost anyone exposed to
heroin is also exposed to the addict community generally and
knows the risks involved in becoming addicted. It -is possible
that the existence of large methadone programs would indicate to
some portion of the nonaddict population that they could attain
the euphoria of heroin without having to adopt the life-style as
a whole, and they might find this option more attractive than
either abstinence or full-scale heroin addiction. Present
evidence indicates that there may be a curious gap of belief in
people who become addicted to heroin. They know full well that
the drug is addicting and that the life-style is terrible, but
they do not doubt their own ability to handle the drug without
becoming addicted. For all we know, the unattractiveness of the
life-style may be exercising a potent deterrent effect on others
who are curious but more realistic about the danger of becoming
addicted. Opening up the methadone choice might make these people
more willing to run the risk. Since we know little about the
causes of addiction and even less about deterrent effects, we do
not know whether this is a matter for real concern. If it turns
out to be an important phenomenon, it will create some painful
public-policy choices. </p>

<p><i>Total Size of Methadone Programs. </i>A final question
concerns the portion of the addict population that is amenable to
successful methadone treatment. Any figure is only an educated
guess based upon the observer's estimate of the total number of
addicts, observations about the results of existing methadone
programs, and judgments about the criteria of success. </p>

<p>Official U.S. Government calculations seem to agree that 25 to
33 per cent of the addicted population will be helped by
methadone.&quot; This estimate may well be too low; some program
operators have estimated that their methadone programs drew
almost 50 per cent of the addicts in an area within a year or so
after beginning operations.&quot;' Considering that many addicts
believe street rumors adverse to methadone, and that one would
not expect any program to reach its full potential right away, an
estimate of 50 per cent probably represents a more realistic, but
still conservative, figure, if one assumes that
&quot;success&quot; means &quot;derives substantial benefit from
methadone maintenance.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p><i>ANTAGONISTS</i> </p>

<p>Antagonists are drugs that prevent opiates from having any
effect if the antagonists are administered before opiate
injection and that precipitate withdrawal if administered after
injection. The possibility of using these drugs as a major
treatment modality has intrigued researchers for the last six
years, but at present the antagonists remain experimental.&quot;'
</p>

<p>There are two basic antagonists currently in use for the
treatment of heroin addicts, cyclazocine and naloxone, but an
excellent survey by New York's Health Services Administration
noted that there might be several hundred others already in
existence, as yet untested.&quot;' The most important
characteristics of these drugs are as follows: </p>

<p>Cyclazocine produces unpleasant side effects, such as nausea
sweating, a drunken feeling, anxiety, and hallucinations, but
tolerance to these effects does develop. Naloxone does not appear
to have significant side effects. Cyclazocine is effective when
taken orally and has a duration of action of 12 to 24 hours.
Naloxone is effective when taken intravenously but is relatively
ineffective when taken orally. There does not appear to be any
information on subcutaneous administration, though presumably it
would be less effective than intravenous but more effective than
oral administration. Small doses of an antagonist are effective.
Thus, 4 mg. of cyclazocine will block the effects of 15 to 25 mg.
of heroin for one day. Naloxone is even more powerful if used
intravenously: 1 mg. will block the effects of 25 mg. of heroin
for ten hours. (Taken orally, it requires 200 mg. to block the
effects of 25 mg. of heroin for six hours.) Cyclazocine has
addictive qualities, in that an abstinent user will show some
withdrawal symptoms. Users do not crave the drug even when they
are in withdrawal, however. Naloxone does not have addictive
properties. The antagonists do not reduce the &quot;drug
hunger&quot; felt by the opiate addict. </p>

<p>Most experimentation to date has been done with cyclazocine,
largely because the short duration and ineffectiveness of oral
naloxone makes it an unsuitable candidate for mass treatment. </p>

<p>The NIMH Addiction Research Center is now experimenting with a
new antagonist, EN-1639A. It is two to three times more potent
than the other two, is effective orally, and has a longer
duration of action than naloxone <font size="1">.103</font> </p>

<p>Besides the mechanical problems of dosage and delivery, there
are several major problems in using the antagonists as a
treatment modality. Because they do not eliminate the &quot;drug
hunger,&quot; the patient is constantly tempted to miss his dose
and take heroin. As the HSA paper points out, the fact that
addiction to the antagonist itself is minimal means that it is
possible for him to do this. A methadone patient is tied to the
program by his addiction; an antagonist patient is not. Because
of this problem, and also because of the short duration of action
of many possible antagonists, a major search is under way for a
capsule that could be implanted in the patient to release the
drug slowly over an extended period. It is likely to be some time
before success is achieved, however.&quot;' The civil-liberties
questions involved are also substantial. </p>

<p>Two apparent disadvantages may be due to the experimental
nature of the programs. So far, the costs have been high ($3,000
to $5,000 per addict per year), partly because of the need for
inpatient care common to all experimental programs and partly
because of the scarcity and high price of some of the drugs. The
success rate so far is hard to calculate, but, at best, it has
been about 40 per cent over all, judged by the criterion of
remaining in the program.&quot;' However, some of the failures
may reflect the fact that dosages had to be worked out and
supportive services developed. Future experiments may do better.
One can, of course, argue the opposite-that future, larger
projects will be less successful because the Hawthorne effect of
participating in a new experimental program will be gone. In
addition, there is some evidence that the success rate for
outpatients may be considerably lower than for inpatients. </p>

<p>It is as yet unproved that the antagonists will ever be a
useful treatment modality. Nor is there any reason at present to
believe that the side effects of any antagonists would be less
adverse than those of methadone. It could easily turn out to be
the reverse, with the antagonists having more serious adverse
effects. If an addict is going to be dependent upon long-term
chemotherapy, there appears to be no reason at present for
preferring that he be dependent on an antagonist rather than on
methadone. </p>

<p>Under some theories of addiction, the antagonists could be
useful adjuncts to treatment. If one takes the view that it is
important to extinguish reinforcement of the desire to use
opiates, the antagonists may turn out to be successful. One can
also argue that the use of an antagonist, combined with
supportive services, would force the addict from the addicted
life-style and give him an opportunity to forge a new one.
Finally, and probably most important, is the possibility that use
of an antagonist might turn out to be the only practical way an
addict on methadone can become abstinent. If research should
ultimately show that opiate use does create a drug hunger that
persists for a long period after obvious withdrawal is complete,
then antagonists might be developed that would help the addict
survive this period without readdiction. Dr. William Martin has
found that secondary withdrawal symptoms persist in animals for
at least six months after withdrawal from opiates. If the drug
hunger is such a symptom, and if it persists in humans in similar
fashion, there is at present no way for an addict to leave a
methadone program without enduring six months of craving opiates.
As is obvious from the failure rates for abstinence programs, few
manage to do this. If an antagonist could prevent relapses from
leading to readdiction during this period, it would be
valuable.&quot;' </p>

<p>Dr. Martin is cautious about the antagonists. He states only
that, if the research goals are achieved, &quot;I believe that
certain motivated addicts can be benefitted by this approach. . .
. [They] may find a role in the treatment of the juvenile
experiment. <font size="4">Others are more enthusiastic, and
suggestions of mass inoculations are occasionally heard. The
wisdom of such ideas is questionable.<br>
</font></p>

<p><i>MULTIMODAL PROGRAMS<br>
</i></p>

<p>Several programs now contain components of all the different
modalities. The Illinois Drug Abuse Project (IDAP), in Chicago,
the Narcotics Treatment Administration, in Washington, D.C., and
the New Haven Mental Health Center, for example, include
methadone, therapeutic communities, detoxification, abstinence,
and supportive services for all types of patients. The Community
Mental Health Center'in New Haven has an experimental naloxone
group as well, and IDAP at one time tried cyclazocine on some
patients. While the approach is promising, rigorous comparison of
multimodal and unimodal programs has not yet been done, and one
can only set forth the present arguments for and against the
multimodal approach. </p>

<p>The arguments in favor run along the following lines: </p>

<p>Most observers believe that different programs work best for
different addicts, although the typologies are not worked out and
no tool has predictive value at present. If a program has several
modalities, an addict can readily transfer from one to another if
he or the staff feels that his performance could be improved by
the change. In addition, failure in one modality does not mean
total failure, because the addict can try another with minimal
delay. </p>

<p>Different modalities attract different types of addicts.
Therapeutic communities, for example, may have more appeal to
younger addicts; methadone, to older. Differences in age,
education, employment, or criminality may also be significant.
But the modality that attracts an addict may not be the one in
which he will ultimately do best. Combining the modalities makes
one an intake center for each of the others, to the benefit of
all. </p>

<p>In some cases, the modality to which an addict applies is an
accident of geography and personal contacts. Centralized
administration can make this choice more rational and productive.
</p>

<p>Each modality has something to contribute to the others. The
group-therapy techniques and intense environment of the
therapeutic community may help methadone patients by encouraging
them to become abstinent or by improving their understanding of
the factors that led them to addiction. They may also have an
impact on abuse of other drugs by methadone patients. Conversely,
TC residents and other abstinent patients may benefit from
knowing that there is a back-up program if they do not succeed in
remaining abstinent. </p>

<p>A multimodal program will find it easier to develop new
strategies for the treatment of addiction. For example, it may be
possible to have patients who are basically abstinent but receive
low doses of methadone if they feel the craving for drugs is
about to overwhelm them. This could be a particularly important
technique for teenagers. It would be difficult to operate such a
program in connection with any single modality, because both the
administrative structure and the ambience would be against the
experiment. </p>

<p>Politically, it is advantageous to combine the modalities, so
that they will stop fighting each other and unite to get more
support from the government. </p>

<p>The primary arguments against multimodal programs are as
follows: </p>

<p>Most of the benefits to be gained from eliminating accidental
assignment, allowing rapid reassignment, and experimenting with
new programs may be achieved just as well by better
administration and coordination of separate modalities. </p>

<p>Multimodal programs have the basic problem that they transmit
contradictory messages to the patients. The ethos of most such
programs is that abstinence is superior and that methadone
patients, while not so bad as heroin addicts, are definitely
second-class. This lack of psychological support makes it more
likely that the methadone patient will fail. It may also make it
difficult for a patient who is not doing well on an abstinence
program to change to methadone-he may leave treatment entirely
rather than accept what be and his peers view as a demotion. If
such an attitude does not pervade the project, the reverse
problem may occur: The abstinent patient may not see why he
should endure drug hunger while others are receiving methadone. </p>

<p>In this view, faith is a very important part of every
modality. The evangelical nature of the TC has been discussed,
for example, and it may be a necessary part of the therapy. Part
of the success with methadone may be due to the fact that
patients come to believe that they have a metabolic disease and
are going to receive a medicine that will help them. In short,
mixing different modalities may undermine all of them by
confusing the patient about the expectations and possibilities of
the program. </p>

<p>Resolution of this issue must await further research that
explicitly compares the success of the different components of
multimodal programs with that of comparable techniques used
alone. </p>

<p>Since multimodality is a growing trend, such evaluations
should be performed soon.<br>

<hr>

<p><i>HEROIN MAINTENANCE <br>
</i></p>

<p>One treatment modality that is not used in the United States
at present is maintenance of addicts on heroin or morphine. While
many, perhaps most, observers react negatively to the idea, there
are good reasons for trying it on an experimental basis. The
major argument in favor is that heroin maintenance might attract
two important groups of addicts: those who do not succeed on
methadone maintenance and those who do not volunteer for it in
the first place. If this were the result, addiction-related crime
would be decreased, because the costs of the heroin habit would
be eliminated and, as a benefit to the addict, the chances of
infection, overdose, and imprisonment would be lessened. In
addition, since remarkably little is known about the etiology of
addiction or the effects of heroin, controlled clinical
experimentation with heroin maintenance would allow some
important questions to be studied. It is also possible that
heroin maintenance would break the market for heroin and remove
the impetus for expansion caused by the high profits of illegal
distribution. (The English experience, described by Edgar May in
Staff Paper 7, is, of course, instructive.) </p>

<p>The most important objections to heroin maintenance are as
follows: </p>

<p>The administrative expenses would be high. If the drug were
administered in clinics, it would have to be made available about
four times a day. Also, because heroin is relatively ineffective
orally, medical personnel might be required to give injections to
ensure a sterilized procedure. Both factors would increase
expenses. If the English system were adopted and the heroin were
dispensed from pharmacies on prescription, it would be difficult
to control the dosages, track the patients, secure the heroin,
and avoid infection and disease. Because of heroin's sharp peaks
and short duration of action, it may be a difficult drug on which
to find and maintain a constant dosage even if the patient
desires stabilization. There is always physical pressure on the
patient to increase his dosage. To make this problem worse, a
maintenance program would draw addicts who were not willing to
give up the effort to attain the euphoria of heroin. Thus, they
might take their maintenance dose, buy more on the street, and
then demand that the clinics maintain the new, higher dosage.
While there may be a pharmacological ceiling beyond which the
drug has no additional euphoric effects, this is not definitely
known. Addicts on heroin maintenance might quickly reach levels
of 100 to 200 mg. of heroin per day, a dose higher than that of
almost all present addicts. The physical effects of this dosage
are not known. Many members of the black community would oppose
heroin maintenance, interpreting it as a scheme to keep the black
community tranquilized and quiet or as an indication that society
is concerned only with the crime caused by addiction, not with
the addicts themselves. Still others, who believe that continuing
use of heroin causes long-term organic damage, might regard
heroin maintenance as a form of mass murder. </p>

<p>The high doses that would tend to prevail in such a program
would tranquilize addicts and make them function ineffectively.
This would make rehabilitation efforts impossible. </p>

<p>Heroin maintenance might draw patients away from methadone,
thus transferring them from a program with proved effectiveness
for rehabilitation to one that is probably counterproductive in
terms of reformation of the addict's life-style. </p>

<p>The existence of heroin maintenance would remove an important
deterrent to experimentation with heroin-the obvious degradation
of the addicted life. </p>

<p>These objections have force. It seems doubtful that society
would wish to move to a large-scale heroin-maintenance program at
the present time, especially if doing so would undercut
methadone. However, there are limitations on the effectiveness of
methadone and on the extent to which it can eliminate the
addiction problem. If, for example, only 50 per cent of the
addicts are helped by methadone, the country may be left with a
sizable addiction problem even after methadone has reached its
full potential. Despite the problems, it is likely that heroin
maintenance will begin to receive serious consideration. It would
be wise to start accumulating solid knowledge on its workings and
effects, and on the validity of the objections to it, before
proposals for large scale programs make the matter urgent. There
will not be time to do so afterwards. Careful experimentation is
desirable.<br>

<hr>

<p><i>TREATMENT OF USERS OF NONOPIATES <br>
</i></p>

<p>Treatment of users of the amphetamines, barbiturates,
hallucinogens, and cannabinols has two distinct aspects. The
first is (,crisis intervention&quot;-emergency assistance to
those who are suffering from adverse effects of drugs. The second
consists of longterm programs designed to prevent future drug
use.<br>
</p>

<p>CRISIS INTERVENTION <br>
</p>

<p>Overdoses of opiates and barbiturates constitute a medical
emergency, and death results unless steps are taken
quickly.&quot;' For other drugs, the adverse effects are more
psychological than physical-usually the user is having a severe
mental disturbance as a result of the drug and needs
psychological support until the body clears the drug from the
system.&quot;' </p>

<p>Until recently, users of nonopiates suffering from adverse
effects of drug taking had nowhere to go except hospital
emergency rooms. Most users were reluctant to do this, both
because hospitals often felt compelled to report the illegal drug
user to the authorities, and because emergency-room personnel
treated them demeaningly. In addition, drug users came to believe
that the treatment received in hospitals was not very helpful. In
fact, the reaction of the medical personnel tended to intensify
and prolong the user's own panic. In the words of one observer,
&quot;Modern medical science can keep a panic reaction going for
about five days.&quot; The hospital use of strong tranquilizers
is regarded by experienced drug users and drug-treatment doctors
as unnecessary and possibly damaging. Chlorpromazine, the usual
drug given, has strong side effects... and is unpleasant in its
psychoactive characteristics.&quot;' </p>

<p>Free clinics, manned by interested professionals, experienced
youths, and volunteer doctors, have sprung up in many cities. The
Haight-Ashbury Clinic in San Francisco seems to have been the
prototype. The Langly Porter Youth Drug Unit at the University of
California is another. It is not known how many there now are,
but it is probable that every large city has at least one, some
have several, and the movement is spreading rapidly to suburban
communities. </p>

<p>The treatment provided to drug users on a &quot;bad trip&quot;
consists primarily of &quot;talking down&quot; the patient, which
can be done by peers who have had similar experiences.
&quot;Quiet rooms&quot; for such &quot;talk downs&quot; have been
recommended as a component for all emergency medical centers that
treat youthful drug users. The patient is not left alone and is
constantly reassured about who he is and where he is.
Establishment of verbal contact with the patient is recommended,
and there is little or no use of tranquilizers. When
tranquilizers are used, chlorpromazine is the most common, given
either orally or, preferably, intramuscularly, which avoids
adverse gastrointestinal symptoms. Experimentation is going on
using short-term barbiturates instead. As of 1970, the Berkeley
Free Clinic claimed to have given only three tranquilizing
injections to &quot;freakouts&quot; since the clinic began; the
rest were talked down. </p>

<p>Heavy amphetamine users and barbiturate addicts present
different detoxification problems. The barbiturate addict needs
to be withdrawn from his addiction under a carefully supervised
medical regimen in an inpatient hospital setting, for the
withdrawal process itself is life-threatening.&quot;' Heavy
amphetamine users are apt to suffer from paranoia, sometimes
leading to violence; they need a quiet recovery room away from
strangers whom they may consider enemies. They often shy away
from hospitalization for fear of arrest. </p>

<p>Treating soft-drug users for adverse reactions is an important
health measure to prevent possible deaths, suicides, or bizarre
and self-destructive behavior. Since most facilities that perform
this service do not have a follow-up capacity, there is no way of
telling how many patients return to drug use and how many abandon
it after experiencing adverse reactions. The treatment process
itself is not concerned with abstinence but with the immediate
problem. Many of the patients seen in these clinics are only
occasional experimenters or sporadic-users. </p>

<p>Before the drug legislation of 1970, there was no basis for
federal funding of these crisis clinics. The law now provides
that HEW can make grants for such partial services to drug users.
Some of the clinics are not enthusiastic about federal backing,
fearing that it will lead to greater conformity in approach and a
decreased ability to utilize ex-drug users in new roles. Federal
or state governments might also impose bureaucratic standards on
staff training and facilities without contributing enough money
to meet the costs of these requirements. There is also a fear
that government backing will turn away some clients. <br>
</p>

<p>LONG-TERM THERAPY <br>
</p>

<p>While the crisis centers provide necessary emergency services,
it is unlikely that they have much permanent impact on drug
users. There is therefore a movement to expand the centers to
include programs that will have some effect on the drug-using
behavior of patients. As a result, the crisis centers are
beginning to offer long-term therapeutic help as well as
emergency services. </p>

<p>This expansion is not limited to the treatment of drug users.
Most clinic staff members view drug problems as only one aspect
-and not always the most serious-of human malfunctioning for
which help should be provided. For example, the Center for
Special Social and Health Problems in San Francisco, according to
its descriptive materials, is concerned with drug abuse, sexual
problems, violence and hatred, compulsive gambling, suicide,
management of death and dying, crime and delinquency, inability
to manage finances, obesity, and insomnia. While this list is
more ambitious than most, it illustrates the general trend
toward, broadening the scope of the crisis clinic. In a way,
these organizations are becoming privately run community
mental-health centers. </p>

<p>The techniques and operations of these programs are about the
same as those of the therapeutic communities and outpatient
abstinence programs. Since, at present, there is no chemotherapy
for soft-drug use, no treatment comparable to the methadone
movement is possible. The basic problem with nonaddictive soft
drugs is that continued use reflects the user's desire to keep
taking them or a psychological dependence on them, which can be
even more difficult to deal with than a physical craving. As one
study points out, &quot;Student drug users are, as a group,
knowledgeable about the undesirable effects of drug abuse. In
general, it is not difficult for most student drug abusers to
stop. The issue is to get them to want <font size="1">to
Stop.11113</font> </p>

<p>While some soft-drug users are in TC's, the majority of those
receiving help are in some form of outpatient program, usually
the same programs described in the section on outpatient
abstinence for opiate users. Often, the patients themselves are
the same. A number of heroin addicts use other drugs as well, and
youthful drug users are increasingly experimenting with heroin as
one of several drugs they try. Whether it is possible to sustain
a pattern of sporadic heroin use without becoming addicted is as
yet uncertain. The &quot;speed culture&quot; in the
Haight-Ashbury section of San Francisco has produced some
evidence that speed users, who first use barbiturates to ease the
&quot;crash,&quot; soon learn that heroin is an even smoother way
to achieve this purpose. Eventually they may abandon speed
entirely and become heroin addicts. It is possible that a pattern
of multiple drug use that includes heroin is an intermediate step
toward full addiction.&quot;' It is even more difficult to
determine the success of these programs with soft-drug users than
with narcotics addicts, in part because most experts believe that
youths who become heavily involved with cannabis and
hallucinogens do not usually stay involved for a long period of
time.&quot;' This fact, of course, increases the difficulty of
evaluating the impact of any drug program, because abstinence is
a poor indication of the program's effect. </p>

<p>Some work is going on in the area of chemotherapy. An effort
is now being made to find antagonists to some of the more common
drugs. Researchers tentatively claim to have found a drug that is
an antagonist to amphetamines, although it has not yet been fully
tested, and some work is being done on antagonists to LSD.
However, it is not clear whether these drugs, when and if they
are perfected, will have a significant impact on drug use, since
soft drugs are taken without the spur of physical necessity.
Unless a policy of forced implantation is followed, the drug user
will always have a choice about taking the antagonist, and in
most cases the choice would probably be to continue drug use. </p>

<p>There are, however, two hypotheses under which the antagonists
might be useful. The amphetamines appear to be physically
addictive to a limited extent, and this could exert some pressure
on the amphetamine user to continue his use.&quot;' An antagonist
might prevent the constant renewal of this physical dependence
and give the user's body a chance to become free of it. Secondly,
if one adopts a conditioning theory of drug use, an antagonist
would eliminate the reinforcing effect of gratification from drug
use and might in time extinguish the conditioned response of
taking drugs. </p>

<p>One of the most carefully evaluated methods of decreasing soft
drug use is transcendental meditation. A Harvard Medical School
Study gave questionnaires to 1,950 subjects who had been
practicing transcendental meditation for three months or more. Of
these, 1,862 completed the questionnaire. The decrease in drug
use was quite striking. The study says: </p>

<p>Following the start of the practice of transcendental
meditation, there was a marked decrease in the number of drug
abusers for all drug categories. . . . As the practice of
meditation continued, the subjects progressively decreased their
drug abuse until after practicing 21 months of meditation most
subjects had completely stopped abusing drugs. For example, in
the 6-month period before starting the practice of meditation,
about 80 percent of the subjects used marijuana and of those
about 28 percent were heavy users. Aftel practicing
transcendental meditation 6 months, 37 percent used marijuana and
of those only 6.5 percent were heavy users. After 21 months of
the practice, only 12 percent continued to use marijuana and of
those most were light users; only one individual was a heavy
user. The decrease in abuse of LSD was even more marked. Before
starting the practice of transcendental meditation, 48 percent of
the subjects had used LSD, and of these subjects about 14 percent
were heavy users. In the 3 months following the start of the
practice of meditation, 1 1 percent of the subjects took LSD
while after 21 months of the practice only 3 percent took LSD.
The increase in the number of non-users after starting the
practice of meditation was similar for the other drugs: non-users
of the other hallucinogens after 21 months of the practice rose
from 61 to 96 percent; for the narcotics, from 83 to 99 percent;
for the amphetamines, from 70 to 99 percent; and for the
barbiturates, from 83 to 99 percent.117 </p>

<p>As the researchers point out, these correlations are not proof
of causation. &quot;Involvement in other kinds of
self-improvement activities may also lead to decreased drug
abuse. The motivation to start meditation may have influenced the
subjects to stop drug abuse. The subjects in the present study
may have spontaneously stopped, continued, or increased taking
drugs independently of transcendental meditation.&quot;&quot;' </p>

<p>Despite these necessary caveats, the results are striking,
especially in an area in which, as the study delicately points
out, &quot;Existing programs for the alleviation of
[non-narcotic] drug abuse usually involve education as to the
dangers of the effects of drugs and sometimes provide personal
counseling or psychiatric care. The efficiency of these programs
has yet to be established.&quot;' (Staff Paper 6<b>, </b>by Dr.
Andrew Weil, deals with meditation and other nonchernical means
of achieving altered stages of consciousness.) <br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><i>CONCLUSION<br>
</i></p>

<p>Few solid conclusions emerge from this morass of conflicting
information. It is clear that methadone is a helpful treatment
modality, but just how helpful is not yet known. It is equally
clear that its almost inevitable expansion will create new
problems, some of them predictable and some of them totally
unexpected. Not much can be said about the other treatment
modalities and concepts. Those who favor them have not yet proved
their case, but neither have those who are skeptical. On the
whole, it seems probable that they will turn out to have only
marginal effectiveness as drug-treatment methods, although they
may have possibilities as a part of the more general
human-potential movement. The basic problem is that we lack any
solid theory or understanding of the nature and causes of
addiction. As researchers have repeatedly pointed out, for most
drug users the drugs are functional and adaptive mechanisms.
Society cannot make long-term progress toward developing more
effective treatment mechanisms without grasping and accepting
this fact. At present, however, we have little choice but to
proceed empirically.<br>

<p><font size="1">The program promises to return the addict to a
useful life &quot;through extended periods of treatment in a
controlled environment followed by supervision in an after-care
program.&quot; The emphasis is on &quot;controlled.&quot; The
addict receives about as much rehabilitation as the criminal
prisoner with about as much result-the recidivist rate for
addicts is much higher than for criminals. Moreover the
rehabilitation centers are run like prisons. There are guards,
most of whom receive training for prison work-one guard for every
two inmates, recalcitrant addicts are beaten and placed in
isolation on reduced diets; inmates are sexually abused; there is
no separation of the young from the old. The few rehabilitation
programs that do exist are staffed by instructors and therapists
who have received little or no training. For the 5,000 or so
inmates in the 14 separate institutions there are only 4
psychiatrists, 16 psychologists, and 78 teachers and vocational
instructors. The prison-like atmosphere has caused a large
percentage of the addicts to try to escape. [Health Policy

<p><font size="1">34. These are difficult numbers to pin down.
According to the <i>NIMH Directory </i>(p. 144), 40 programs
listed themselves as therapeutic communities as of about 1968. It
is not clear how stringent the standards for inclusion were,
however, and this may include some programs that are essentially
outpatient abstinence with group work. At the other end, it
misses some of the newer therapeutic communities.</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">The population figure is also an educated
guess. Most TC's are in New York, and knowledgeable sources
estimate that the Phoenix Houses (the city's TC program) had
about 1,000 residents and private TC's about 1,400 in 1970.
Synanon had about 1,400 residents <i>(NIMH Directory, </i>p. 32).
These places account for the largest number of TC residents, but
there are many others with 10 to 100 residents scattered
throughout the country. The estimate of 5,000 residents is
probably an upper limit.</font> </p>

&quot;Methadone Maintenance and Its Implication for Theories of
Narcotic Addiction,&quot; in Abraham Wikler, ed., <i>The
Addictive States </i>(Baltimore, Md.: Williams &amp; Wilkins Co.,
1968), p. 359, postulates an inherent neurological vulnerability.
But, at the Second National Methadone Maintenance Conference, Dr.
Dole was asked: &quot;Apart from any psychological factors or
emotional factors, is there a metabolic irregularity which causes
a craving for drugs in the first place or does the metabolic
irregularity come after the use of drugs or both?&quot; His
response was: &quot;This is a very important question for which I
have no adequate answer. I can only guess. My opinion is that a
heavy exposure to heroin induces the metabolic changes. According
to this theory, the abnormal drug craving in man, like the
induced drug seeking behavior in animals, is a result of exposure
to narcotic drugs and not the original cause of the
addiction.&quot; <i>Second Meth. Conf., pp. </i>359, 370.</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">65. Dr. Dole seems to lean toward the idea that
the metabolic change is permanent. He has stated: &quot;I believe
one has to reckon with the fact that heroin hunger is probably a
symptom of a pharmacological imprint that may last for a man's
life.&quot; Vincent Dole, &quot;Research on Methadone Maintenance
Treatment,&quot; <i>Second Meth. Conf., </i>pp. 359, 370.</font> </p>

proposed by Charles Winick in &quot;Maturing Out of Narcotic
Addiction,&quot; <i>Bulletin on Narcotics, </i>XIV, No. 1 (1962).

groups of addicts to determine whether they do, in fact, mature
out. The onethird figure is based on a number of these works as

of immediate administration of an antagonist to prevent death

<p><font size="1">109. There are variations, of course. The user
who has taken an excess of hallucinogen or cannabinol is not

Distribution * Consumption<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">This paper applies economic analysis to the
heroin market and to the effect of alternative government
policies on this market. The principal concern is supply, but
some discussion of demand is included because the effects of
public policy on the supply of drugs cannot be adequately
analyzed without some knowledge of the effect on demand of
changes in price, risk, and availability. The analysis must be
considered tentative. Accurate information on the economic
aspects of all drugs of abuse is scarce, that which exists is
frequently unreliable, and conclusions are often suspect. This
paper is no exception.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Much of the data used were taken from two
studies: (1) <i>The World Opium Situation </i>(October, 1970), by
the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD) Intelligence
Staff; and (2) <i>Economics of Heroin Distribution </i>(1970), by
Mark Moore. While these papers contain the most extensive
economic research available in this area, the information is not
unimpeachable. This is not because of deficiencies in the
studies-which are excellent -but because of the inherent
difficulty of gathering accurate information on illegal
enterprises or consumers of illegal commodities.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The BNDD staff paper is the result of an
extensive survey of opium production and consumption throughout
the world. The paper provides considerably more data, in terms of
both quantity and quality, than are available from the United
Nations or from other publications. Unfortunately, it is not
possible to verify this information through other sources, nor
does it appear that it will be possible to do so in the near
future.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Moore paper provides a macroeconomic
analysis of the heroin distribution system, as well as
considerable interview data on daily expenditures of addicts and
sources of funds. The data are not derived from sufficiently
large samples to allow precise estimates, but they do indicate
rough orders of magnitude. Other data derived from interviews
with BNDD staff members or U.N. publications are subject to the
same general weaknesses. <br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>PRODUCTION<br>
</i></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">SOURCES OF SUPPLY <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The production and distribution of opiate
narcotics at the international level are complex and
little-understood matters. The crisis of heroin addiction that
has afflicted the United States in recent years has obscured the
fact that the growing of opium is an age-old, legal occupation in
many areas of the world. Heroin addicts in the United States
consume only a very small amount of the total quantity of opiates
produced worldwide. The Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs
estimates that 10,000 to 12,000 pounds of heroin are sufficient
to supply the entire addict population in the United States for
one year.' Since, as is generally acknowledged, ten pounds of
opium are required to manufacture one pound of heroin, only
100,000 to 120,000 pounds of opium are needed for illicit heroin
use in the United States about 2 per cent of the estimated world
production </font><font size="1">.2</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Of the opium used by the U.S. heroin market, 80
per cent comes from Turkey, 15 per cent from Mexico, and 5 per
cent from the Far East.' These are not precise figures, however,
but assumptions rather generally derived from heroin seizures and
knowledge of the international illicit drug-import routes.'
Moreover, several recent developments may change the sources of
supply for the U.S. market. On June 30. 1971, President Cevdet
Sunay of Turkey decreed that all poppy cultivation and opium
production in that country will be forbidden beginning in the
fall of 1972. Until that time, licit opium production will be
limited to only four provinces and strictly policed. How well
this policy will be enforced, and what ultimate effect it will
have on heroin use in the United States, cannot as yet be
determined. However, already there has been considerable
speculation that the Far East supplies a greater amount than was
thought previously. The tighter controls now being imposed by
Turkey and the increased contacts between the U.S. and Southeast
Asia caused by the Indo-China War have shifted the sources of
supply somewhat.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Raw opium itself is produced from the poppy
plant <i>(papaver somniferum-the </i>sleep-bearing poppy), which
consists of a thin main stalk, three to four feet tall, with
several egg-shaped pods on top. Between June and July, the poppy
blooms, and, 10 days later, when the blossoms lose their petals,
the pods are ready for the opium resin to be extracted. Incisions
are made in the pods, and a milky fluid oozes out. At the end of
the day, this substance is scraped off the pods by hand. It later
hardens into a brown gum and is pressed into cakes of raw opium.
The amount of opium produced from a poppy crop will increase if
this process is repeated once again, as in Turkey, or several
times, as in India, but the morphine content will be reduced with
each lancing.'</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Many factors affect the opium yield per
acre-the quality of the soil, the temperature, rainfall, the
quality of the seedirriga-tion, fertilization, and crop rotation.
Intensive cultivation and a great deal of labor are required to
produce opium, particularly during harvest, when the pods must be
incised and the raw opium collected by hand, but labor is also
needed during the growing season to thin the poppy plants. It is
estimated that between 175 and 250 man-hours of labor are
required to produce 1 kilo of opium.6 Because of this
labor-intensive production process, poppies tend to be raised
only where labor is abundant and relatively inexpensive; but
there seems no clear reason, given a different set of relative
prices for labor and capital, that a more capital-intensive
process could not be employed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Most poppy cultivation occurs in a zone
stretching from central Turkey through Iran, Afghanistan,
Pakistan, India, Burma, Laos, Thailand, and southern China, with
the greatest concentration in India and Southeast Asia. Poppy
cultivation is legal in India, Turkey, the U.S.S.R., and Iran.
Turkish licit poppy acreage was reported to be 29,600 acres in
1970.1 According to U.N. figures, India has at least 86,500 acres
planted.' Iran, which abolished the production of opium from 1956
to 1968, planned 29,600 acres of poppy cultivation for 1970. In
addition, roughly 30,000-32,000 acres each are believed to be
planted in the Soviet Union, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, and
negligible amounts of licit opium are produced in Yugoslavia and
Japan.'</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">According to figures reported to the United
Nations by producing countries, the total licit world production
of opium is 1,0601,085 metric tons, or approximately 40-45 per
cent of the total produced. India is by far the world's largest
licit producer of opium, with a reported 750 metric tons in 1968.
Turkey and the U.S.S.R. each contribute 115-120 metric tons of
licit production. An estimate of 75-100 metric tons was made for
Communist China, based on expected medicinal needs for its
population. The estimated totals for licit and illicit production
are presented in Table 4-1.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Licit opium is used primarily in the
manufacture of medicinal opiates. Legal morphine production
currently amounts to approximately 150 metric tons per year-a
substantial rise from around 85 metric tons per year in the
mid-1950's. This growth is due chiefly to the rising demand for
codeine, but a small portion of the licit opium is used for
opium-maintenance programs in India, Pakistan, and Iran.<br>
</font></p>

<p><img src="img00005.gif" align="bottom" width="1294"
height="1119"> </p>

<p><font size="2">The world's illicit production of opium is
estimated at 1,2501,400 metric tons annually.10 The principal
concentration of illicit production is in the Burma-Laos-Thailand
region, which <br>
</font><font size="1">produces an estimated 700-750 tons. The
Afghanistan-Pakistan area produces another 250-300 tons of
illicit opium, and </font><font size="2">the </font><font
size="1">illicit output of Turkey is estimated at 100 tons.
Illicit cultivation of the plant also occurs in parts of Mexico,
South </font><font size="2">America, and North Africa, although
the amounts produced there are negligible. While some illegal
acreage is planted in Turkey, most of the illicit opium there is
diverted from the yield on legal acreage. On the other hand, all
the opium produced in Afghanistan, Burma, Laos, and Thailand and
part of the outputs of India and Pakistan are derived from
illegal acreage. About 40 metric tons of illicit Turkish
production was thought to enter Iran in 1970; the remainder is
exported to Western Europe and the United States.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Southeast Asian countries consume most of
their own opium, but some is shipped to Hong Kong for use there
and for distribution throughout the Far East. A small amount,
perhaps one or two metric tons, is shipped to the United States,
although this figure has probably risen recently. India also
consumes the major part of its illicit production; and, although
some of the Afghanistan-Pakistan production is consumed
internally, approximately 200 metric tons is thought to enter
Iran. Iran is the largest consumer of illicit opium in the world,
with an estimated 350,000 opium and heroin users. In 1969, Iran
began controlled production of opium in order to maintain its own
addicts.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1"><b>YIELDS, MARKET PRICES, AND
INCOMES<br>
</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Income from poppy cultivation is affected by
the opium yield obtained, the morphine content of the raw opium,
and the current licit and illicit market prices. The reported
yields per acre in 1969 for four countries are presented in Table
4-2, but, since these are government figures provided by the
local farmers, both yields and acreage are probably understated.
This is undoubtedly the case for the crop yields in Turkey and
Pakistan. Turkish yields are closer to 13.4-14.2 pounds per acre,
with the nonreported amount diverted to illicit traders.&quot;
Opium yields are estimated at 8.6-28.6 pounds per acre in
Southeast Asia&quot; (probably closer to the lower figure&quot;),
and the Soviet Union reports yields of 27.5-32 pounds per
acre.&quot;<br>
</font></p>

<p><img src="img00006.gif" align="bottom" width="1290"
height="592"><font size="1"><b> <br>
</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Prices for opium vary with quality. The
morphine content of Turkish opium, reportedly the highest in the
world, varies from 9 to 13 per cent, while in other producing
countries the morphine content varies from 4 to 12 per cent.
Prices to farmers for raw opium are presented in Table 4-3.
Because of its quality, the prices for Turkish opium are the
highest, with the exception of the Iranian price, which is
supported by the government in order to discourage diversion to
illicit traders. The licit prices are determined by the world
market price: the price at which the national opium monopolies
can sell to pharmaceutical companies. In Turkey, the illicit
price varies with the yield of the current year's harvest, the
season, enforcement efforts, and the demand for Turkish opium
from other countries, particularly Iran. The illicit price in
Iran is extremely high because of the strict enforcement of laws
against illicit trading.<br>
</font></p>

<p><img src="img00007.gif" align="bottom" width="1299"
height="657"> </p>

<p><font size="2">The absolute income per farm from opium
cultivation is greatest in Turkey, but the percentage of total
farm income accounted for by opium increases as one moves
eastward. In the late 1960's, there were an estimated 70,000
farms producing opium in Turkey. If 120 tons are sold by these
farms at the licit price of $11 per kilo 0 kilo=2.2046 pounds)
and 100 tons on the illicit market at $25 per kilo, the gross
income from opium amounts to $3,820,000, or $55 per farm. This
amounts to roughly 5-10 per cent of farm income in Turkey. In
India, roughly 200,000 farms earn $70-75 from poppy cultivation,
or 15-20 per cent of average total income per farm. Since the
income figures include income-in-kind (food, clothing produced on
farm), the income from opium provides an even higher percentage
of cash income than we have indicated. Opium is probably the
principal source of farm income in Burma, Laos, and Thailand;
cultivation is said to be concentrated in areas controlled by<b> </b>guerrilla
insurgents, who transport much of the output to Hong Kong and use
the proceeds for arms purchases.','</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Licit production of opium is of minor
importance even in India and Turkey. India earned roughly $6-7
million for exports of 530 metric tons in 1968, compared with
total export earnings of $2 billion. Indian farmers earned
approximately $7.7 million on production of 700 metric tons.
Turkish exports of 120 metric tons yield approximately $1.7
million, less than 0.3 per cent of total exports. Turkish
production is also very small in relation to national income of
$9 billion. On the other hand, opium sales are undoubtedly of
great economic importance to the producing regions of Burma,
Laos, and Thailand. <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><i>POLICY OPTIONS: WHAT CAN BE DONE<br>
</i></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Policies designed to attack the heroin problem
at the source of supply devolve into two basic alternatives: (1)
the purchase of entire opium crops, or (2) direct controls on
production. Each of these proposals has problems difficult to
surmount at present.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">PRE-EMPTIVE BUYING <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The first alternative would be for the United
States to purchase the total output of opium from those countries
that supply the heroin entering its borders. The administrative
simplicity of this proposal makes it appear deceptively
attractive. In time, however, pre-emptive buying would
necessarily involve purchases of both licit and illicit
production in all countries where opium is currently grown. The
U.S. offer price would have to be raised above the maximum price
illicit traders are willing to pay; otherwise, the farmer would
have an incentive to sell to the higher bidder. If the offer
price is less than the illicit price, leakages into the illicit
market would probably result, and the policy would therefore have
little effect on the supply of opiates sent to the United States,
especially since the amount is so small relative to total world
production. And, seemingly, the illicit trader would be willing
to increase his offer price substantially, because, given the
large markups at each stage of the distribution system, the price
of raw opium has relatively little effect on the ultimate retail
price in the United States (see Table 4-4). (For example, if the
current price to the farmer for 10 kilos of illicit opium is
$250, and the retail street price for I kilo of heroin is
$264,900, then raising the farm price 100 per cent would raise
the retail price only .09 per cent.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">A pre-emptive buying policy would become very
costly, because opium producers would have a clear incentive to
increase their outputs, and other farmers would have a similar
incentive to begin substituting opium for other crops. Eugene
Rossides, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Enforcement and
Operations, has gone on record as strongly opposing any concept
of pre-emptive buying. He told a congressional committee that
&quot;it would simply stimulate production and it would take away
the responsibility of each nation to handle the problem as part
of the international community.&quot;&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Moreover, without strict administrative
controls, this policy would not only increase production in all
countries currently producing opium but might induce other
countries whose climate is suitable to begin production in the
hope of sharing in the windfall.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If this policy were directed at only one source
of supply, such as Turkey, it would not prevent traders from
obtaining illicit supplies in other producing countries. The
100,000-120,000 pounds of opium used by the U.S. market could be
grown in an area of, at most, 11.2-23.2 square miles and thus
could easily be absorbed in another producing region.&quot; In
fact, some experts believe that 35 pounds of opium could be
produced on a single acre of land if a capital-intensive process
were employed under controlled circumstances. -If this proved
true, -generally, only 4.55.4 square miles would be needed to
supply the entire U.S. market. Consequently, a pre-emptive buying
policy, in the long run, could result in a change of location for
the source of U.S. supply with little or no effect on the
addiction problem.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Pre-emptive buying within an individual country
might prove effective in dealing with an internal addiction
problem if coupled with strict limitations on acreage and illicit
importation. Iran, for example, has discouraged export to illicit
markets in other countries by purchasing its entire internal
opium crop at a very high price, restricting production to
certain designated areas, and strictly enforcing its laws against
illicit markets. The legal opium purchased by the government is
used by the state-run addict maintenance program, in which 50,000
individuals are registered. The potential expense is one problem
with the high-support-price approach. If nearly all Iran's
300,000-400,000 users and addicts entered the program, the cost
would rise dramatically. Furthermore, even with severe penalties
against smuggling and illicit trading, Iran still experiences
difficulty in trying to prevent the importation of opiates. Some
success has been reported in eliminating illicit supplies from
Turkey, but imports from Afghanistan and Pakistan have not been
halted. The mid-1970 price in Iran for Afghani opium was well
below the licit price, despite intensive law-enforcement efforts.
It seems that the heavily armed mountain tribes operating out of
both Afghanistan and Pakistan have not as yet been deterred by
either the border authorities or the death penalty on smuggling.
On the other hand, the price of illicit Turkish opium in 1970 was
as high as $400 per kilo in Tehran-six to seven times the
government support price.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">As the Iranian example shows, the success of a
pre-emptive buying policy, even if accompanied by administrative
controls, depends on whether government can effectively exert its
will over the producing regions. In fact, most of the world's
opium supply is produced in areas where little political control
exists. Administrative controls themselves are difficult to
enforce, as we shall see. Therefore, because of the size of the
world market relative to U.S. heroin consumption, the high
elasticity of supply, and the difficulty of control, it is
unlikely that a policy of pre-emptive buying could be successful.
<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">DIRECT CONTROLS</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The application of administrative controls
alone is the other basic alternative to reduce opium supplies.
This involves restricting the acreage on which opium can be grown
and maintaining a low official price. A low official price may
reduce the illicit price, at least in the short run, and thereby
discourage illegal planting and crop diversion. Certainly, taken
by itself, a low official price will not induce new production.
But the most salient feature of direct controls is increasing the
risks of illicit trading and consequently reducing the
profitability.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Practically, however, continuous enforcement of
direct controls is both difficult and costly, and the necessary
resources available to most producing countries are quite
limited. Especially in countries with weak central governments,
controls present severe administrative problems. All countries
with an illicit trade lack adequate numbers of both trained law
enforcement personnel and motor vehicles. Given the low wages in
public-service jobs and the large profits in the opium trade,
corruption of government and police officials is a widespread
problem in most countries and is likely to continue. The bribes
that illegal importers are willing and able to pay are
considerably higher than the amounts officials are currently
accepting for inaction or nonenforcement of the law. Widespread
social acceptance of opium use in many rural areas of Pakistan,
Afghanistan, India, Burma, Laos, and Thailand is another
difficulty that makes enforcement of controls for the benefit of
an outside country appear especially burdensome. In Turkey, where
there is reportedly little opium use, controls have been
extremely unpopular because of both the loss of an important
source of farm income and the rising anti-American sentiment.
While limitations on local financial resources could presumably
be eased by American aid, the administrative and political
difficulties severely limit the possibility of successful
controls.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If, however, the desire and resources to do so
were present, controls could probably be applied successfully in
certain individual countries. Communist China and Iran
successfully eliminated production in the 1950's. Turkey has
restricted legal acreage of poppy cultivation to 29,652 acres
from 103,782 acres in 1960. In the process, illegal production
may have been somewhat reduced, because illicit Turkish opium is
believed to come principally from larger than declared yields on
legal acreage.&quot; Turkish officials seem committed to their
pledge to enforce a ban on all poppy cultivation by the fall of
1972. The chances of this policy's success will be discussed
later.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The major problem in curtailing opium
production is that most of the world's supply is produced in
areas where no national control exists. The lack of control is
virtually complete in the producing regions of Burma, Laos, and
Thailand. Areas that are largely controlled by tribal groups are
responsible for opium production and distribution in Pakistan and
Afghanistan. Therefore, it seems likely that attempts to control
or abolish opium production in Turkey would have little effect,
as illicit traders turned to these areas for supplies. Indeed,
the recent changes in Turkey do not seem to have caused any
decrease in total U.S. imports of illegal opiates.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Still another difficulty is that of restricting
opium production in one country when neighboring countries do
not, or cannot, restrict production. After twelve years of
prohibition, Iran returned to limited production, because its
addicts were purchasing illicit opium from Turkey, Pakistan, and
Afghanistan.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Even in Turkey and India, control systems have
failed to halt the cultivation of illicit opium. Turkish farmers
make written declarations to the government of their licensed
acreage and expected kilogram yields, selling the surplus to the
illicit market. In 1969, for example, Turkish officials collected
116 tons of licit opium from poppies in eleven provinces. But in
1970, when nine provinces were allowed to produce, only 60 tons
were turned in. Presumably diversion accounts for some of the
difference. Some illicit production in Turkey has occurred from
unlicensed acreage, but this is relatively easy to discover if
sufficient efforts are made, since the poppies have a long
growing season and are easy to detect, especially from the air.
In India, on the other hand, the illicit opium output is produced
principally on unlicensed acreage.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Direct controls might be more effective if they
were combined with crop substitution, subsidies for production of
other goods, or direct payments for not growing poppies. But crop
substitution is unlikely to be successful, since it is difficult,
if not impossible, to find crops that yield as high a return per
unit of land as opium. For example, attempts to substitute a
high-yielding Mexican wheat in Pakistan failed because the crop
provided a return per acre roughly half that of opium, assuming
opium is sold at official prices.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In Turkey, there has been a sound agricultural
reason that crop substitution is difficult. Apart from
low-income-producing grains, the poppy is the only autumn-sown
crop and is not easily replaceable by the higher-yielding spring
crops, such as cotton, maize, sugar beets, tobacco, or melons.
The opium produced is important to the small farmer, not only
because of the amount of income gained, but also because it is
harvested before the grain and therefore provides expense money
for the main harvest. Furthermore, the harvest of opium occurs in
a period when the farmer has little else to do and can spend his
time on the lancing of the poppies and collection of the opium.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Subsidies for production of alternative crops
would certainly be required if the substitute crops provided less
income than opium. The cost of producing a unit of a substitute
crop would be reduced by a subsidy, and the transfer payment from
the government would allow the grower to increase production and,
in the process, bid resources, land, and labor away from other
crops, including opium. Because these inputs would become more
expensive, the cost per unit of producing opium would increase.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">However, if demand for opium in this particular
national black market is relatively insensitive to changes in
price, opium production would be little reduced, and little
reduction in farmer income would result. A higher subsidy would
be necessary to raise the relative return on the alternative
crop. If the demand for opium varies with price,&quot; perhaps
because of the availability of opium from other sources or
synthetic opiates, then the subsidy would probably reduce much of
the country's production.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Clearly, subsidies for output of other goods
could be set high enough so that the output of opium in a given
country could be greatly reduced. This may come, however, only at
great expense to the government or to the United States, if the
latter sponsors the program. The same types of administrative
problems that exist in the crop-purchase proposal are repeated
here.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Basically, it may be difficult to determine how
much of the production of the subsidized crop is actually land
diverted from opium.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Similar administrative problems would result if
governments made payments to producers for not growing opium,
since it would be difficult to determine how many farmers who do
not grow opium now would demand payment. In 1972, when Turkey's
complete prohibition on poppy cultivation goes into effect, the
government plans to pay farmers on the basis of the value on the
international market of their whole opium crop sold the previous
year to state officials. But, if only those who were originally
&quot;licensed&quot; to produce are given payments, and no
payments go to those who planted illegal acreage, there is no
incentive for these growers to cease producing opium, nor is
there an incentive for nongrowers to resist the urge to produce.
Furthermore, to be effective, payments must exceed the return on
output sold illegally. Since the illicit price of opium is
extremely low relative to the retail price of heroin in the
United States, it could rise greatly without much effect on the
final price to the addict. Therefore, payments would have to be
extremely high to be effective and would make the program very
costly. Thus, it also seems unlikely that a policy of direct
controls on opium production, even if combined with crop
substitution, subsidies for production of other goods, or direct
payments for not growing opium, could be completely successful.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">General economic development in poppy-growing
areas may eventually reduce the relative profitability of this
crop. The usual process is for technological innovations in
agriculture to increase the productivity of fanns to the point
where large surpluses of labor develop. Migration of labor to the
cities occurs because of the availability of employment and
public services. As industrial development increases the demand
for labor, real wages rise, and capital-intensive production
processes become more desirable. If no capital-intensive method
of cultivating opium can be found, then the return on poppy falls
relative to other goods and opium cultivation is greatly reduced.
Clearly, this ignores changes in the demand for opium; moreover,
it is, at best, a long-run solution. This situation may
eventually develop in Turkey but is not likely for a very long
time in the East. <br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>DISTRIBUTION<br>
</i></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Several books and articles have described the
system ky which opium is transformed into heroin and imported
into the United States. They are all in substantial agreement,
possibly because the primary source of information on the subject
is the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In the case of Turkish opium, growers either
withhold part of their output or plant illegal acreage.
Small-scale entrepreneurs gather opium from the farms in
relatively small quantities and deliver it to syndicates in or
near Istanbul. At this point, the opium is transformed into
morphine, which cuts the volume by 90 per cent. This process
formerly took place in Syria. but as relations between Syria and
Turkey have deteriorated in recent years, border controls have
been tightened and the morphine labs moved to the Istanbul area.
From Istanbul, the morphine is transported overland through
Bulgaria and Yugoslavia or by ship to its destination in southern
France, where covert laboratories refine the morphine into
heroin. (One theory is that some of the heroin labs are located
in trucks and are thus mobile and difficult to detect.) Once
refined, the heroin is smuggled to the United States through New
York, Montreal, or some other large port. According to some
sources, shipments are also being sent to the U.S. via South
America through a Southern port.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">MARKET <b>STRUCTURE <br>
</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">The best available outline of the domestic
heroin distribution system, at least for New York City, was
developed by Mark Moore of the Hudson Institute.&quot; His
outline relies, in turn, on earlier analyses by John Casey and
Edward Preble&quot; and information from the Bureau of Narcotics
and Dangerous Drugs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Moore suggests that heroin passes through six
levels of distribution: the importer, the kilo-connection, the
connection, the weight dealer, the street dealer, and, finally,
the juggler or pusher. Table 4-4 shows the outline of the system
and includes estimates of the prices and value added to the
heroin at each level. Before reviewing the operation of the
specific segments of the system, it is important to discuss the
over-all market structure of the business. The key questions here
are: How tight is vertical organization? How competitive is the
system at the various levels? How much increase in risk would be
required to make it unprofitable for large operators to stay in
business? <br>
</font></p>

<p><img src="img00008.gif" align="bottom" width="1289"
height="1968"> </p>

<p><font size="2">For many years, conventional wisdom held that
the heroin business was monopolized by organized crime, perhaps
by the Mafia. BNDD now seems to believe, probably as a result of
recent arrests of South Americans at relatively high levels, that
10 or 12 large wholesalers with varying degrees of connection to
organized crime now control the distribution process in the
United States.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It seems clear that many economic principles
operating in society at large must also apply to illegal
enterprises,&quot; since the business of supply and distribution
of illicit drugs is presumably subject to the same general
economic laws, and responds to the same general set of
incentives, as prevail in more open industries. There are, of
course, some crucial differences caused by the fact of illegality
and also by the moral problems associated with dealing in many of
these drugs-for example, the need to minimize the risk of
detection of the origin of the distribution system.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Hudson monograph argues that the objective
of the industry is to maximize profits within the constraint of
the risk of arrest and imprisonment, and that this objective is
most likely to be attained if the industry is organized into
several small distribution units separated vertically from one
another, if higher levels in the system are monopolized, and if
lower levels are competitive with some elements of market power
(monopolistic competition). The small distribution units in the
heroin industry are separated from one another by restricting
information at one level about the identity and activities of
other levels. Risks are limited by close supervision and
discipline of employees, thus reducing the probability of
information leaks, and by the fact that penetration of one level
will not result in penetration of another. The primary
disadvantage of small, separate distribution units is their
inability to adjust to large changes in demand; suppliers end up
with either excessive or deficient inventories.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Moore argues that a monopoly could most
efficiently perform the functions required of the high levels in
the distribution network. The top levels in the system must: (1)
restrict the total supply of heroin to maintain high market
prices, (2) regularly and reliably supply an amount of heroin
fairly close to the realized demand, (3) manipulate supply
conditions above them with a minimum of explicit planning and
negotiation, and <b>(4) </b>adjust to errors in supply with a
minimum of negotiation and activity. A centralized organization
would be more effective in handling each of these problems. A
monopolist can restrict the total supply, allowing high prices
throughout the system. In addition, he is in a position to have
an efficient ordering policy, thus successfully accommodating
uneven deliveries and lead time. Agents can be coerced into
holding inventories or resupplied when short of heroin. Tight
control can be maintained over the circulation of information.
Finally, a monopolist can maintain a monopoly position in
relation to producers.. thus reducing lead times, unevenness, and
quality deterioration.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In contrast, a competitive market would be less
likely to ensure a smooth, restricted supply, adjusting to errors
in a discreet, efficient manner. In a more competitive situation,
it is more difficult to pool shipments or parcel out uneven
deliveries of heroin. With many suppliers at the top, there are
more transactions, more explicit negotiations, more occasions of
short supply or large inventories, more information circulating
freely-and thus a greater probability of arrest. A monopoly,
therefore, is logically the most efficient type of organizational
structure at high levels.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">But a successful monopoly requires the
existence of some type of leverage or barrier to entry, such as
(1) special knowledge unavailable to others, (2) total control
over some vital raw material, or (3) total control over the
market as to make the cost of entry prohibitive, especially if
entry requires a large fixed investment. It is doubtful that any
of these considerations applies to the heroin traffic. The
knowledge required to refine opium into heroin is certainly not
difficult to acquire. It is also doubtful that the knowledge of
methods of conducting illegal activities-such as smuggling-is so
limited as to allow any firm to maintain a monopoly. There are no
substantial fixed costs other than the investment in an
information system, needed to offset the high level of risk in
the trade. However, the difficulty, and thus the cost, of
developing such an information network may be a formidable
barrier to entry.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Trusted personal relationships with Turkish or
French syndicates may have put some organizations in a monopoly
position for Turkish opium. However, it would be in the interest
of the Turkish or French firms to sell to as many importers as
possible, forcing them to bid against each other and thus raise
the price of heroin. A firm desiring to enter the business
should, therefore, be able to establish the necessary
connections.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It is possible, of course, that the suppliers
are not profit maximizers; they may not wish to accept increased
risks for the sake of increased profits. Instead, after
establishing an acceptably low level of risk, they may seek to
maximize profits within this constraint. Such an approach would
sacrifice many of the benefits of competition among buyers
because of the need to limit the number of people who know the
supplier's identity. (This factor also operates as a barrier to
entry at other high levels of the distribution system.) If the
barriers to entry in the market for Turkish opium are too great,
however<b>, </b>a potential importer could go to Hong Kong,
Bangkok, Karachi, or Saigon.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Finally, as noted, trying to erect a barrier to
entry by attempting to control the raw material does not seem
feasible. The U.S. market relative to total world production is
simply too small to prevent other supplies from becoming
available. Also, the retail product is homogeneous and easily
divisible, making it difficult to hoard.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">However, for an illegal business, there are
additional techniques of monopolization. Violence is the most
likely method of securing market control; illegal operators can
readily hire agents or firms willing to kill quietly and
efficiently. If a heroin-distribution monopoly became established
early and acquired both a large organization and a sophisticated
information system, it could make it extremely dangerous for a
rival to compete. First of all, it might have the key advantage
of knowing who is trying to enter the business before its own
prior presence can be discovered. Since rivals would find it
difficult to purchase a comparable intelligence service secretly,
this acts as an important barrier to entry. Another way of
enforcing monopoly of an illegal product is to control the use of
legal force-corrupting police officials to serve one's own ends.
An effective use of corrupt police would be to have one's rivals
eliminated via arrest; sufficient arrests would satisfy the
public and allow the police to refrain from attacking the
monopoly itself. It is in the interest of the police, in turn, to
eliminate competition, protecting the source of their payoff
money while appearing to be effective law enforcers. The
symbiosis between criminal enterprise and elements in law
enforcement is well known and has occupied many investigatory
commissions without being eliminated.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">A firm could also obtain police cooperation
without police corruption. If one organization has better
intelligence than any other, and better intelligence than the
police, it could simply inform the police of the competing ring
and possibly provide the evidence necessary to break it up.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">The BNDD believes that 10 or 12 large wholesale
operations exist in the United States today. Thus, the potential
barriers to entry have apparently not been strong enough to allow
any one firm to enforce a monopoly. The system has probably
developed into an oligopoly or cartel, with each firm maintaining
a type of monopoly control of firms below it in the lower
distribution levels. It is not clear what agreements, if any,
exist among these firms with respect to prices or market areas,
but the risk of detection may limit the mobility of distributors
between top-level suppliers, thus allowing firms at the top to
maintain vertically integrated supply systems.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">At lower levels in the system, there are many
competitive suppliers, strict monopoly being impossible because
of the difficulty of disciplining customers. At these levels,
most customers are addicts who are highly motivated to maintain
relations with as many suppliers as possible. Low level suppliers
are arrested much more frequently than those in higher levels,
because they deal more often and more openly. Thus, relationships
between consumers and suppliers are constantly breaking up and
beginning again. Furthermore, addicts are always trying to break
into the lower levels of the system, and, given the small amount
of trust, skill, and capital needed, personnel and organizations
change rapidly.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Nevertheless, some elements of monopoly control
remain. Information is often unavailable to consumers, thus
restricting the number of markets in which they can buy. Also,
addicts find it useful to restrict their purchases to dealers who
consistently provide a high-quality product and who give them
lower prices as loyal and trusted clients. Thus, limited
information and product differentiation maintain elements of
monopoly advantage even for suppliers at low levels. <br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">COSTS AND PROFITS <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Existing analysis of the economics of each
segment of the heroin industry is fragmentary because of the
nature of the business. The best available analysis is again that
of Moore, and most of the comments in this section are derived
from his model of the system.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">For the importer and kilo-connection at the
higher levels of the distribution system, the operating
costs-principally wages and inventory finance costs-are estimated
to be a much greater percentage of value added than at lower
levels (50-55 per cent versus 30 per cent). Importers need
skilled employees for the smuggling process and periodically
require large amounts of capital to finance transactions with
producers and processors. Kilo connections have relatively large
wage costs because of the elaborate organization needed for
exchanges and maintaining inventories as well as disciplining
lower-level suppliers. Financing costs are also high at this
level because of the need to store inventories for uncertain
periods of time.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Operating and finance costs are more moderate
for connections. Although they need to employ agents to develop
new markets, discipline customers, dilute heroin, and make
deliveries, there is a much faster turnover of inventories at
this level. The rate of turnover minimizes financing, but
connections may be forced to accept it from sources higher in the
organization. Weight dealers, street dealers, and jugglers are,
for the most part, self-employed; inventories are turned over
quickly, and individuals at these levels rarely have financing
problems.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In contrast to operating costs, expenditures
for bribes as a per cent of value added appear to increase as one
moves from high to low levels (2 per cent versus 5 per cent). At
the importer and kilo-connection levels, well-placed bribes can
secure considerable immunities at relatively low costs. Expenses
for bribery increase at the connection level, because they are
more vulnerable to arrest, engaging in a relatively more visible
activity. They must also frequently make payments to other
criminal organizations for &quot;protection.&quot; Weight
dealers, street dealers, and jugglers become even more vulnerable
to extortion and will also have to pay rather large bribes (as a
per cent of value added) to law-enforcement agencies.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Profits are great at each level of the
distribution network but decrease as a per cent of value added at
lower levels of distribution. Gross profits include (1) a
financial return equal to what could be made in the firm's next
best alternative line of business (its opportunity cost), (2) a
return to compensate for the risk of arrest and incarceration,
and (3) a return to monopoly power.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The kilo-connection at the top level of
distribution is probably the single most powerful component in
the system. At this level, gross profits are high and are
maintained by a large degree of monopoly power. Economic theory
suggests that the firm's profits must be at least as high as the
return from other attractive illegal opportunities, such as
loansharking or gambling. While risk-the probability of arrest-is
relatively low, the combination of monopoly power and high
opportunity costs makes profits at this level high. For the
importer, profits are probably less than those of
kilo-connections. His risks are low, because, being high on the
ladder, he is difficulty to identify. Opportunity costs are low,
because, with the substantial investment in building his
information network, an importer can make more money dealing in
heroin than he could make elsewhere. Some monopoly power exists
because the personal-relations network operates as a barrier to
entry, but this is probably limited by the encouragement by
kilo-connections of free-lance importers.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Gross profits of connections are less than
those of the two upper levels. The restricted access to
information about operations allows some degree of
monopolization, but risks become greater as visibility increases
and the police become more successful at arrest and conviction.
At this level, opportunity costs are low because of the large
investment in personal relations, which are not valuable unless
the connection is engaged in the heroin trade. Connections can
accept lower profits, and still find the business more profitable
than alternatives.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The remaining levels are characterized by
relatively high risk and low opportunity costs. All three levels
of<b> </b>operation are -relatively visible, have relatively high
arrest rates, and thus require adequate compensation for risks
incurred. On the other hand, opportunity costs are low because
few operators on this level have the skills required in other
types of enterprise. At the weight dealer level, a small degree
of monopoly is maintained, because access to information is
limited. At the street-dealer and juggler levels, monopoly
profits are minimal.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Analyzing operating costs and profits at each
stage of heroin distribution carries important implications for
law-enforcement policy. In summary, if a firm's costs are high,
and it has little monopoly power or attractive income-producing
alternatives, it may be quite easy to increase the risk enough so
that the firm leaves the industry. If these conditions do not
hold-if profits are high and protected by monopoly, or if few
good alternative profit opportunities exist-the firm might well
absorb the cost of the increased risk. These factors largely
determine the outcome of possible law-enforcement strategies. <br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">EFFECTS OF -POLICE -PRESSURE</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Increased police pressure on the distribution
system can clearly increase the risks' and operating costs of
those involved. Evidence does not show, however, that any one
firm is large enough or monopolistic enough so that its
destruction or neutralization would have an important impact on
the total distribution system and thus on heroin use at the
street level. During the last few years, the arrest of even major
distributors and traffickers has had no significant impact on the
price or availability of heroin. On the international level, for
instance, in the first six months of 1971, BNDD participated in
the arrest of 113 major traffickers outside the United States,
seizing large quantities of drugs in the process. Federal
officials face an almost impossible task of trying to stop the
smuggling of drugs at the border. About 250 million people enter
the country every year. Approximately 65 million cars and trucks,
306,000 planes, and 157,000 ships entered in 1970.&quot; If this
were not enough,<b> </b>customs officials state that, on an
average-size ship arriving at the Port of New York, there are
30,000 places where heroin can be hidden. Domestically, the
situation is not much different. A study of the undercover unit
of the New York City police narcotics division revealed that, in
1970, agents made 7,266 buys of narcotics that resulted in 4,007<b>
</b>arrests. However, only 4.97 pounds of highly adulterated
heroin were seized in these actions, at a total cost of $91,197,
and with no appreciable effect on heroin distribution citywide.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">In such a situation, law enforcement must rely
on the indirect effects of general deterrence rather than on
direct disruption. But it is far from clear how firms operating
in the field regard a successful attack on another firm.
Possibly, such an attack will cause them to reassess their own
risks and assume that they are in greater danger than they
believed before. On the other hand, it may be that existing firms
will simply assume that the destroyed operation was incompetent
or lacking in security and see no need to reassess their own
risk.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">To the extent that police are successful in
increasing a distributor's probability of arrest, one would
expect the chain to lengthen as each supplier attempts to deal
with fewer buyers and places more distance between himself and
the street. Suppliers would invest more time and absorb greater
operating costs in designing more complex delivery systems to
better conceal their activities. The risk involved in holding
inventories would cause suppliers to hold less in reserve, thus
increasing the time and complications involved in arranging
purchases and sales. However, police pressure might also increase
a monopoly's hold on the system. A monopoly can absorb the
increased risks more easily and is also likely to be better
protected. Markets might become even more centralized. Because of
higher costs and lack of competition, prices could be expected to
rise.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">For all these reasons, it seems clear that law
enforcement can raise the price of heroin. The effects of higher
prices, and thus the ultimate impact of law enforcement, are
uncertain. They depend heavily on how total demand reacts to the
changes.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">One hypothesis is that demand is inelastic,
that an addict is dependent on heroin and will try to maintain
his level of consumption regardless of price. If this is so, then
law-enforcement policy will have little effect. The added costs
of greater risks will be shifted to consumers, and the revenues
of the industry will increase. So will the social costs of the
activities addicts engage in to support the habit. (A logical
question is why firms are not already maximizing profits-that is,
if prices and revenues could be raised before the increased cost
was incurred, why did this not, in fact, take place? This may be
due to concern with public reaction. Higher heroin prices cause
higher crime rates, which increase the public's demand for strong
policy measures against the heroin traffic. Therefore, firms may
attempt to maximize profits, given the -constraint of maintaining
a low level of risk. This calls for keeping prices low enough so
that the crime needed to support it remains
&quot;tolerable.&quot; Competition might also play<b> </b>a
part.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">A second theory is that demand is elastic, that
a price rise does cause a disproportionate decrease in
consumption. If so, then the suppliers would have to absorb the
increased cost of higher risks or raise the price and accept a
decline in total revenues.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">While it is commonly believed that the
addictive nature of heroin causes the demand for it to be
inelastic, it might, in fact, be elastic, for two reasons: First,
the development of methadone during the past few years has
created a low-cost alternative for addicts that did not exist
before. Secondly, over the last thirty years there has been a
substantial long-term rise in the price of heroin relative to the
price of other consumer goods. This may have produced a situation
in which most addicts are maintaining their habit at the highest
price level they are able to support. If the price increased
further, these addicts would have no choice except to decrease
the quantity of heroin used, because they would be unable to
raise their income enough to meet the new cost.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If the demand is elastic, a law-enforcement
policy could be effective. If the price of heroin increased and
methadone was necessarily substituted, the social costs of
addiction, including crime, would decrease. If addicts chose to
adapt by using less heroin for the same cost, however, the crime
costs would not be decreased. It could be argued, on the other
hand, that increasing the cost of being an addict hastens the
time when the addict voluntarily leaves the addicted life.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">The firm attempting to maximize profits,
subject to the constraint of maintaining a low level of risk, may
choose to absorb the risk as increased operating costs rather
than attempt to shift it to the consumers. This, of course,
results in a lower rate of return and reduces the attractiveness
of heroin distribution. In the heroin business, the gross profits
of a firm (revenues minus operating costs) must be at least equal
to the return the firm could earn in an alternative investment
(its opportunity cost).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Profits that exceed opportunity costs can be
considered a return to a monopoly position or compensation for
risk. Gross profits must exceed opportunity costs by at least
enough to compensate the firm for the risks it undertakes. If
gross profits, less opportunity costs, exceed the compensation
required for risk, the firm will stay in the business.
Alternatively, if gross profits, less opportunity costs, are less
than the return required for undertaking risk, the firm will not
be willing to absorb the risk and will leave the industry.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Risk for an illegal firm can be viewed as equal
to the probability of punishment, as the firm perceives it, times
the cost of certain punishment to that firm. The cost of certain
punishment is equal to the amount the firm would be willing to
pay to avoid </font><font size="1">it.26</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The probability of punishment can be affected
by public policy and by the firm's own actions, because it
depends on the probability of being apprehended and successfully
prosecuted. Changes in the criminal-justice system are essential
if high-level distributors are going to be put out of business.
These include more sophisticated training of police personnel,
higher salaries to lessen the temptation of bribes, and higher
budgets for purchasing information. In reality, law-enforcement
agencies have been unable to raise the level of risk anywhere
near what would be required to make this criminal enterprise
unprofitable. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The cost of the expected punishment to the
illegal operation can also be influenced by changes in judicial
procedures and increases of sentences. Currently, many defendants
in narcotics cases forfeit bail, become fugitives, and, if
apprehended, are more likely to be tried for violating the
conditions of bail than for the original charge. If convicted,
this means a lesser sentence. The economic cost in such a
case-the amount the offender would pay to avoid detection-should
be equal to the amount of bail, plus the probability of being
arrested while. at large, times the penalty for jumping bail.
This cost would be increased if a change in public policy raised
the amount of bail or the penalty for violating its conditions </font><font
size="1"><b>.21 </b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">On the other hand, the probability of
punishment can be reduced if the illegal operation spends more on
bribes and devising elaborate, less conspicuous pickup and
delivery systems. If increased amounts are spent to reduce risks,
however, the illegal firms reduce their gross profits at the same
time. A firm will expend these sums if in doing so it can keep
its gross profits (minus opportunity costs) above the 'cost of
escaping imprisonment. If it is impossible, through further
spending, to reduce the expected risk below gross profits, less
opportunity costs, firms will leave the business. Alternatively,
firms could limit sales to trusted buyers, thereby reducing
revenues and gross profits but also reducing the chances of
getting caught.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">According to Moore's analysis of the
distribution hierarchy, gross profits are considerable at every
level. However, for the kilo-connection, high-yielding
alternatives are the greatest, and it is possible that monopoly
at this level could be broken. BNDD appears to believe that the
monopoly has already been broken, and that the industry is now
operating as an oligopoly with ten or twelve firms. But,
conceivably, an oligopoly or cartel could develop techniques for
supplying the total market as efficiently as a centralized
organization. If satisfactory agreements can be reached, the
amount of explicit communication necessary to guarantee avoidance
of frequent shortages or surpluses would be minimal. However, the
market becomes more unstable with a cartel, because there is
always an incentive for one firm to increase its sales at the
expense of another. If one firm does try to improve its position,
the others are likely to follow. If all try to do so, oversupply
develops, attempts to expand the market increase, prices decline,
and profits fall. In the process, higher levels of the
distribution system become more visible to the authorities, and
the probability of punishment increases. A kilo-connection may
then find one of his high-yielding alternative opportunities more
attractive and leave heroin distribution. Thus, there is always
some incentive for the police to attempt to infiltrate the
network at higher levels. Arrests made at this level reverberate
through the system, making arrests easier at all levels.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It is far from clear, however, that such a
public policy is altogether sound. While it could have a high
payoff in terms of seizures of heroin and arrests, it would lead
to considerable market expansion and increased heroin
availability. The elimination of monopoly would permit the
entrance of new firms; a competitively organized industry will
always provide more goods at lower prices than will a monopoly.
Market expansion would occur if lower prices increase the demand
for heroin, and, in fact, this may be occurring. Two very large
seizures by BNDD in May and June of 1970 reportedly had no effect
on price. No panics occurred following the seizures, as one would
expect, and the short-term trend over the year was one of
declining prices.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Theoretically, the best allocation of police
power is at the levels of the distribution hierarchy, where the
incremental gains from their actions (in terms of reduced social
costs) are equal to the incremental costs of the enforcement
efforts. This clearly requires employment of more resources at
some levels than at others. While the payoff from attempts to
infiltrate higher levels may be large, this policy is also very
expensive. And, again, it is possible that such a policy would
lead to a larger, less organized trade. Use of police resources
at lower levels has less potential for large payoffs but is less
costly. It is much easier to interrupt the heroin traffic at the
retail level, because firms engage in more transactions,
concealment is more difficult, and information is more available.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">On the other hand, risks must be increased
considerably before it becomes no longer profitable for low-level
operators to remain in the industry, because their opportunity
costs are low-i.e., they probably could not earn nearly so much
doing something else. Police are continually eliminating these
low-level operators through arrest, but, given the high profit
potential, others still find it worthwhile to enter the business
because of their low opportunity costs, mistaken perceptions of
the probability of punishment, or the low value placed on being
incarcerated for a given period. In addition, most street dealers
and pushers are themselves addicts. Being in the business keeps
them near the source of supply, giving them an income sufficient
to finance their own consumption and enabling them to buy their
own drugs wholesale.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Clearly, if heroin demand becomes relatively
elastic at some point as prices rise, the police could eventually
be successful in eliminating the industry. However, to accomplish
this, it is probable that society would have to allocate an
extraordinary amount of law-enforcement resources. Society might
prefer to reduce the industry to the &quot;optimum&quot; size,
where the costs imposed by heroin use are just equal to the
additional cost required to reduce it further.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>CONSUMPTION</i></font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The consumption of heroin imposes costs on the
rest of the community, because most purchases are financed
through criminal acts such as theft. Because of these involuntary
redistributions of existing wealth, the community spends
resources to prevent crime and to apprehend, try, punish, and
rehabilitate criminals. This includes private expenditures on
locks, alarms, lights, and security guards and public
expenditures on police, courts, and correctional systems. To the
extent that these human and material resources would be employed
elsewhere in the absence of heroin addiction, they are properly
counted as costs of addiction. Social costs also include the
medical expenses and foregone productivity of individuals injured
in crimes and the lost productivity, medical expenses, and
premature deaths of addicts. Finally, one must also include the
fear and anxiety, avoidance of normal activity, disruption of
community life, and use of less efficient and more expensive
modes of transportation that are unquantifiable but nonetheless
very real costs of crime and drug addiction. This section
examines the direct cost of heroin consumption and estimates the
amount of crime required to finance it.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The most elementary question in determining the
direct costs of heroin consumption is the total cost of the
heroin consumed that is, how much money do addicts need to
support their addiction? But this calculation depends on several
unknowns: the number of addicts, the average number of days per
year heroin is consumed, and the average cost of heroin per day,
with an adjustment for the amount of heroin &quot;earned&quot;
from profits on sales to other addicts.&quot; This information is
essential for determining the magnitude of the problem and the
benefits from any investments designed to control or reduce it.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">THE ADDICT POPULATION <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The actual number of heroin addicts in the
United States is unknown and probably can never be determined
precisely with present techniques of estimation. Addicts become
known to officials only through death, arrest, or participation
in treatment programs. It is difficult to estimate the size of
the addict population from the number of deaths or arrests,
because each of these figures depends on other variables as well
as sum totals. For example, the ratio of addict deaths to addict
population will vary not only with the number of addicts but also
with the probability that a decedent will be medically identified
as an addict. Similarly, the frequency of addict deaths from
overdose will vary with sudden changes in the concentration of
pure heroin in the local supply. The ratio of addict arrests to
number of addicts can vary with the intensity of police efforts
in certain areas. The ratio of addicts in treatment to total
addicts can vary with the addicts' perception of the value of
treatment or the short-term availability of heroin.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Because of these difficulties, most estimates
of the addict population are mere guesses. However, there are two
methods that may ultimately prove useful, although both have
pronounced weaknesses at present. One is the &quot;Baden&quot;
formula, developed in New York City by Dr. Michael Baden of the
Medical Examiner's Office, and frequently applied elsewhere. New
York is unique in having a register of local heroin addicts as
reported by medical and police sources. The formula was computed
by comparing the number of addicts on the registry to the number
of overdose deaths and the number of deaths among persons named
on the register.&quot; Baden found that 50 per cent of the heroin
addicts who die are on the Narcotic Addict Register. On this
basis, he estimated that the total addict population numbers
about twice the registry total. In 1968, for example, the New
York Register had 42,500 addicts listed; it was therefore
concluded that the total addict population was approximately
85,000.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">This method has several problems, of which its
originators were well aware and are quick to acknowledge. They
were seeking a way of making a quick estimate of the total
population that would be more adequate than the register alone
without incurring expenses for research time. (It is ironic that
Dr. Baden is sometimes castigated for defects that he was the
first to point out.) First, it is assumed that addicts who are on
the register have the same probability of dying as those who are
not. If registered addicts are heavier users and thus more
susceptible to disease, such as malnutrition and hepatitis, they
would have a higher probability of dying. On the other hand, if
addicts not on the register are less experienced users they may
be more likely to die of overdose. Either, both, or neither
hypothesis could be correct, and it is impossible to determine
the net effect.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Secondly, since the register is cumulative over
a five-year period, some on the list will no longer be addicts
because of successful treatment, abstinence, or incarceration. To
the extent that this is the case, the estimate will exceed the
actual total by twice the size of the error in the register.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Third, the probability that an addict is listed
on the register is, in part, a function of his age and length of
addiction. A thirty year-old addicted for ten years is more
likely to be listed than an eighteen-year-old addicted for one
year. A sophisticated application of the technique requires at
least an age breakdown, and possibly other distinctions as well.
Baden himself works with such distinctions, but others who use
the method often do not. Serious difficulties develop when
officials attempt to use the Baden formula in other cities or at
other points in time. Statistical analysis of one set of
circumstances is rarely transferable to different situations. In
other words, heroin addicts in different places, for whatever
reasons, probably do not die at the same rate. Furthermore,
differences in diagnostic method change the probability of a
decedent's being identified as an addict. For example, in
Washington, D.C., during the eighteen months preceding July,
1970, diagnostic drug screens were performed on only 6.3 per cent
of all autopsied deaths; during the last six months of 1970, drug
screens were performed on 51 per cent of all autopsied
deaths.&quot; This frequency can also vary between cities, and a
small variance, when using Baden's formula, would change the
estimated population greatly, because the number of addicts who
die in any given year is likely to be only 1-2 per cent of the
total register.&quot; And New York has by far the best register
of any city.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs has
developed a somewhat similar approach in estimating the total
addict population. It multiplies the number of known users who
could be rearrested by the ratio of total heroin arrests to the
number of known users included in these arrests.&quot; On the
basis of this method, BNDD unofficially estimates that there are
at present 315,000 addicts nationally.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">This method also has several problems. First,
known addicts are voluntarily reported to BNDD by local police
departments. Reporting practices can vary considerably with
locality, as can intensity of enforcement efforts.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Secondly, the probability of any addict's being
arrested in period 2 is assumed to be the same regardless of
whether he had been arrested in period 1. This hypothesis is
unproved. It may be that addicts already known to the police are
heavy users and commit more crimes or are under greater
surveillance. Therefore, the probability of their rearrest would
be greater, and the estimate of the total addict population would
be less than the actual. On the other hand, if the addicts
unknown to the police are younger, and therefore more recently
addicted, the probability of their arrest may be higher, because
younger addicts tend to commit riskier crimes, such as robbery.
In this case, the estimate would be too large.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Thirdly, it is difficult to determine the
number of addicts reported in period I who remain active users
and are therefore eligible for arrest during period 2.
Statistical adjustments must be made for the probability that a
known user will be in jail during period 2, will die, will become
abstinent spontaneously, or will be in a treatment program. BNDD
has thus far adjusted satisfactorily only for the probability
that an addict will be in jail.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Some of the problems involved in these
adjustments are shown by the difficulty of estimating the
probability of death. BNDD made its adjustments on the average
probability that any individual over twenty-five will survive to
the next year. But the mortality rate for addicts is undoubtedly
higher than that of other individuals of the same age. On the
other hand, there may not be many addicts over forty, and thus
the mortality rate as originally calculated was biased upward by
calculating an average probability for all individuals over
twenty-five. Without knowing the true mortality rate, it is
difficult to make the proper adjustments to the estimates.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Some addicts do mature out of addiction as they
age, but the number is not known. Even active addicts may have
weeks or months of abstinence, but again no numbers are
available. Work on these problems is going on, and the results
will probably reduce the estimate below the present 315,000.
However, since reports from various urban areas indicate that the
number of addicts is still increasing, we will use alternative
estimates of 250,000 and 350,000 for the total addict population.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Some officials make a &quot;best guess&quot;
estimate and then attempt to test the reasonableness of the
figure by comparing it with the total population. For example,
the Narcotic Treatment Agency in Washington, D.C., has a
population of 95 per cent black, 85 per cent male, and 85 per
cent between the ages of fifteen and thirty four. Assuming that
the addict population not in treatment has the same
characteristics, one can make an estimate of the penetration of
addiction into the total population with these characteristics.
If there are 15,000 addicts in Washington, 10,296 are black males
between the ages of fifteen and thirty-four. According to 1970
Census data, there are a total of 83,158 black males between
fifteen and thirty-four in Washington, D.C. Thus, 12.1 per cent
of this population is addicted under the assumption of 15,000
addicts, and 8.2 per cent is addicted under the assumption of
10,000 addicts. The problem with these projections is that 8.2
per cent and 12.1 per cent seem equally 'reasonable&quot; If an
estimate approached 25 per cent or 30 per cent of a given
population, one would suspect exaggeration. Penetration
projections appear to have little value except as very rough
assessments.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">DAILY EXPENDITURES FOR HEROIN </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Addicts vary in the amounts of heroin they
consume per day and the per cent of time spent actively using the
drug. Some addicts can afford to increase their habits as their
tolerance to the drug grows; others cannot. There is also great
variance in vulnerability to arrest and incarceration as well as
in the frequency of &quot;vacations&quot; from addiction in
hospitals or treatment facilities. These periods of treatment
also serve to reduce the size using interviews with ex-addicts
and police, developed a breakdown of the addict population of New
York City.&quot; From their data, presented in Table 4-5, one can
estimate that an average addict is an active user 70 per cent of
the time, or 255 days per year per addict.<br>
</font></p>

<p><img src="img00009.gif" align="bottom" width="1311"
height="1179"> </p>

<p><font size="2">The frequently quoted estimates of the daily
costs of supporting an addiction are often exaggerated. Many are
derived from interviews with addicts who regard large habits as
status symbols and commonly overstate the level of their own use.
In general, the amounts of heroin consumed by addicts vary
widely, and reports of these amounts are unreliable. To say that
an addict has a $50 habit does not mean that he will spend this
sum day after day. Ideally, an addict would like to use as much
heroin as he needs to &quot;get high.&quot; In fact, however, the
increasing difficulty of obtaining the necessary money to pay for
increasing dosages imposes an upper limit on most addicts'
habits. But if an addict cannot consistently obtain large enough
dosages of heroin -to get high, he can use smaller amounts
without feeling acute withdrawal symptoms. In effect, the habit
size of a long-time heavy user is often not at the level of
euphoria but only at a level sufficient to suppress withdrawal or
to keep the withdrawal mild. Moreover, while there are many
addicts with expensive habits, there are also many addicts in the
early stages of dependence whose habit requires only $10-15 per
day. These factors should be kept in mind when interpreting any
estimates of the total cost of addiction.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The price, and quality, of heroin needed by an
addict determine his cost per day. Retail prices were obtained by
BNDD -for December, 1970, for several U.S. cities, and are listed
in Table 4-6. The considerable variation in price is probably due
to differences in local supply and demand, risks taken by
suppliers, and, probably, nonrandom buying procedures. The
unweighted average price-except in Chicago, where it is
extraordinarily high for unknown reasons-is about $0.55 per
milligram.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The average quantity used per day is probably
about 55 milligrams of pure heroin.&quot; At $0.55 per milligram,
this results in daily expenditures of approximately $30 per day
for the average addict, representing the amount paid on the
street by the addict who buys solely for his own consumption.
Some earn their heroin through services rendered as a distributor
of heroin-i.e., pusher; thus, the price paid by the ultimate
consumer includes the payment for that service. Heroin
&quot;earned&quot; in pushing, therefore, means that fewer
addicts have to steal from the community, or that some percentage
of the addict population supports the rest by theft,
prostitution, or legitimate work. The Hudson Institute study
estimated that 45 per cent of the heroin consumed is used by
those involved in its distribution and profit from its sale. If
other factors remain the same, the total social cost of heroin
addiction will be less if the percentage of consumed heroin
&quot;earned&quot; from pushing is increased.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">A rough estimate of the annual cost of heroin
purchases can be made using the information presented in the
preceding pages. The assumptions are that (1) addicts spend 70
per cent of the <br>

</font></p>

<p><font size="1">SOURCES OF FUNDS FOR HEROIN PURCHASES</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The high cost of heroin requires most addicts
to resort to crime to finance their habits. Estimates of the
various sources of funds for the support of heroin addiction can
be made with data obtained by the Hudson Institute from
ex-addicts in New York City. As discussed previously,
approximately 45 per cent of the heroin consumed by the addict
population is obtained by selling heroin. This does not mean that
45 per cent of all addicts are pushers but that 45 per cent of
the heroin used by addicts is obtained in exchange for services
rendered in the distribution network. The remainder of the addict
population finance their own habits and those of pushers by
various means, including robbery, burglary, shoplifting,
prostitution, and legitimate work. Most addicts employ a
combination of means, legal or otherwise, in their constant quest
to obtain funds.&quot; The breakdown of sources of funds
presented in Table 4-7 was developed from the Hudson material.
These figures represent the funds used to purchase the 55 per
cent of heroin consumed that is not financed by rendering
services in the distribution network.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It is assumed that shoplifting, burglary, and
larceny yield real property, and that pickpocketing, robbery, and
confidence games yield cash. Therefore, the total property stolen
in these crimes can be roughly divided into 80 per cent real
property and 20<b> </b>per cent cash.&quot; It is assumed that
real property is fenced at one-third its value, so that an addict
must steal, on the average, property worth $2.60 to obtain $ 1.00
with which to finance his habit.&quot;<br>
</font></p>

<p><img src="img00011.gif" align="bottom" width="1337"
height="580"> </p>

<p><font size="2">The data needed to estimate the funds obtained
through property crime, prostitution, and legal sources used for
heroin purchases can be summarized as follows: <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="1">Number of addicts (N) 250,000; 350,000</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">Per cent of year in active use (T) 70</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">Average daily expenditure (X) $30</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">Per cent of heroin earned through pushing (d)
45</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">Proportion of funds obtained through property
crime (a) .62</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">Reciprocal of fencing discount (average) (f)
2.6</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">Proportion of funds obtained through
prostitution (b) .31<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="1">Proportion of funds obtained through legitimate
sources (w) .07<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The estimates of funds obtained from each of
the three alternative sources of funds are presented in Table
4-8. Clearly, any of these data could be biased in either
direction and thus limit the usefulness of the estimates derived
from them. <br>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>CONCLUSION<br>
</i></font></p>

<p><font size="1">The economics of heroin distribution has been
examined for whatever assistance such analysis may bring to
future policy considerations. Can heroin use be curbed? Can it be
eliminated? What are the most efficient methods of attacking the
problem?</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">In the marketing of any product, there are two
sides to a transaction-supply and demand. Our examination has
shown that public policies dealing with the production of opium
and the domestic distribution of heroin-the supply side-will
never be completely successful in eliminating heroin use in the
United States and the consequent street crime. Indeed, past
reliance on law-enforcement measures has accompanied an epidemic
growth of the heroin-addict population. It is ironic that our
national policy, by resorting almost exclusively to criminal
sanctions to </font><font size="2">eliminate addiction, has bred
a thriving illegal market that can be sustained only by criminal
activity.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Two factors primarily impede public policy
designed to suppress the supply of heroin. First, the amount of
opium needed to supply the demand for heroin in the United States
is only a minute portion of total world production. It is
probably impossible to curb all opium production, licit and
illicit, everywhere in the world. Secondly, the profits earned in
domestic distribution are so great that it is unlikely the risks
can be raised high enough to force dealers out of business. As
one former distributor has stated: &quot;If you put me away,
somebody else is going to stand in my spot.&quot;&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Clearly, more effort and greater resources must
be spent to curb the demand for heroin. For example, more addicts
must be treated and rehabilitated. Education to prevent drug
abuse must be expanded and made more meaningful. Finally, the
environmental factors that breed and sustain addiction must be
more successfully attacked. John Ingersoll, Director of the
Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, has stated before a
congressional committee that law enforcement is the first-aid
agency of society. It is not the curative, not the doctor, and it
doesn't eliminate causes of these problems. Our society has
gotten itself into an unfortunate state of affairs regarding
drugs because it has assumed that by passing laws and enforcing
them, the problem will go away.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">So it seems to me that while you can expect
law-enforcement agencies to do the first-aid work, if you want a
cure, then we have got to go back to the basic causes and find
out what can be done from that end. We have to look to improved
and increased rehabilitation programs. We have to find out more
about drugs and why people use them, knowing of the debilitating
consequences </font><font size="1">.42 <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">No policy, of course, will. be successful if it
addresses only a part of the problem. There appears to be, for
instance, a causal relationship between strict law enforcement
and the number of addicts in treatment programs. If the
probability of arrest is increased, more addicts are induced to
enter treatment. Conversely, if more hard-core addicts enter
treatment programs, pushers must seek out new, less reliable
clientele; they become more visible and thus more vulnerable to
arrest. Development of an effective policy combining efforts to
suppress supply and inhibit demand for heroin necessarily
involves close scrutiny of the economic system and the relative
benefits and costs of various alternatives. In choosing between
policy alternatives, cost-benefit analyses can illuminate the
probable reduction in the social costs of addiction to be derived
from one policy as compared with another. If our public monies
are to be spent efficiently, it is imperative that such choices
be illuminated by full-scale studies of this nature. <br>

assessment is based on two other estimates: the total number of
addicts in the United States, and the quantity of pure heroin
consumed by each addict per day. The accuracy of these estimates
will be analyzed later. But just one year ago, BNDD believed that
only 5,000-6,000 lbs. of imported heroin was sufficient to supply
the U.S. market. The current estimate should be interpreted
accordingly; the actual total is probably somewhat less than
10,000 lbs.</font> </p>

necessary land area could be considerably less, depending on the
number of total addicts and the opium yield per acre. The
11.2-23.2 square-mile estimate is obtained from the data in Table

Ibs. (the approximate reported yield in Turkey), then the area
required to produce 100,000 and 120,000 lbs. of opium is
approximately 19.4 square miles and 23.2 square miles,
respectively. (If 1 acre yields 8.07 lbs., then 12,391.5 acres
will yield 100,000 lbs. This acreage is approximately 19.4 square

suspected, is approximately 14 Ibs. per acre, then the area

These estimates were made on the basis of a relatively small
number of interviews and should not be interpreted strictly.
However, this table provides the best available information on
these aspects of addict behavior.</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">35. This estimate, while lower than several
others, may still be too high. First, the Hudson Institute
average of 55 milligrams includes an estimate that large-habit
dealers (I 1 per cent of the total user population) use 180
milligrams per day. While heroin dealers might have the income to
maintain such a large habit, it seems unlikely that they could be
active entrepreneurs and at the same time use such quantities of
the drug. The Hudson estimate was also derived from interviews
with addicts, who reportedly exaggerate estimates of use. So,
too, there may be less than 10 mg. of pure heroin per bag. 36.
The amount of funds obtained from each of three alternative
sources of funds (property crime, prostitution, legal sources)
can be estimated with the following equation:</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">C=365 [ U -d) NTX (af +b+w) where d, N, T, and
X have the same meaning as in the equation in footnote 28.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="1">C --the gross -amount uf -funds ubtained
-annually -from various -sources -for heroin purchases;</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">a=the proportion of funds spent on heroin that
comes from property crime;</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">b= the proportion of funds spent on heroin that
comes from prostitution; c=the proportion of funds spent on
heroin that comes from legitimate sources-i.e., work, public
assistance, family, or friends;<br>
<img src="img00016.gif" align="bottom" width="1263" height="1934">
f =the factor by which the amount stolen must exceed the amount
yielded by a property crime. (A stolen good must be transferred
from the thief to a fence to a final consumer. The thief receives
only a fraction of the market value of the good. To obtain a
given target yield, an addict can be expected to steal a given
amount, depending on the fencing discount, and the proportion of
value stolen that is property and not cash.) <br>
The amount of money annually spent by addicts for heroin can be
estimated with the equation in footnote 26. </font></p>

<p><font size="1">The cost to victims of property crime committed
by addicts can be estimated by this equation: <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="1"><b>Cv = </b>365 [ (I - d) NTX (af)</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">where C, =cost to victims of property crime.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="1">37. These estimates are also weakened by the
interview technique em-<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="1">ployed and thus should not be considered a
precise reflection of addict behavior.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="1">38. The value of property stolen cannot be
counted totally when the costs to society are added. Some
percentage of the value of goods stolen accrues as a type of
subsidy to people who, knowingly or unknowingly, purchase stolen
goods because the price they pay is significantly below the
market price. This factor reduces the cost of crime to all
society by the value of real property stolen multiplied by the
reduced resale value (the fencing discount).</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">However, in ascertaining how large an
adjustment to make, it is difficult to compare the utility of
gains to the purchaser with the utility of the losses to the
victim-is it greater, less, or the same? In addition, from the
point of view of the community, the loss to the victim may be
given more weight than the gain to the ultimate consumer. The
item may, in fact, lose &quot;value&quot; because it is a stolen
good. Objectively, although a stolen television set may still
operate as well as before, the purchaser may feel that it is
worth less than the market value because of the risk of holding a
stolen good.<br>

</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><i>AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION <br>
</i></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Comprehensive, reliable information on federal
expenditures on drug-abuse programs is difficult to obtain. No
detailed program budget describing the allocation of federal
resources in this area has ever been made public or possibly even
compiled. Although both the Office of Management and Budget and
the Council on Executive Reorganization have made efforts to put
together information, the results have been closely held. The
figures used in this paper are based on budget requests and
amendments, accounts of congressional hearings and other
documents issued by the government, and interviews with
government officials.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The accuracy of this information is sometimes
suspect. Government cost accounting has never been known for its
rigor, and, since drug abuse is now receiving high-priority
attention at the highest levels of government, there is an
incentive for agencies to find a drug-abuse rationale for
programs that may have only a peripheral relationship to the
field.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">There are also technical problems. The Law
Enforcement Assistance Administration, the Department of Housing
and Urban Development, and the Social and Rehabilitation Service
of HEW all award block grants to states and cities. (Block grants
are funds that can be used for any specific projects chosen by
the recipients within a given area of activity.) It is only after
the close of the fiscal year that the portion of these funds
spent for drug abuse can be determined. For these programs there
is no information on fiscal 1972 at the present time.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">On June 17, 1971, President Nixon announced a
new drug abuse program, including a supplemental budget request
of $155,655,000 for fiscal 1972. Shortly thereafter, the
President stipulated that there was to be a 5 per cent.
across-the-board -reduction in government personnel as part of
the anti-inflation effort. Some federal agencies are still unsure
which of these directives will take precedence.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">There are obvious differences among budget
requests, congressional authorizations, appropriations, and
actual expenditures; however, these distinctions are not made
consistently in this report. Generally, appropriations are used
for fiscal 1970 and 1971 and budget requests are used for fiscal
1972, but some amounts are agency allocations within larger
appropriations. Usually, the figures are fairly close to the
actual amounts that were or will be spent for the activities in
each year. However, in some areas, such as research, expenditures
may lag somewhat behind appropriations.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Some agencies, such as the Department of
Defense and the Internal Revenue Service, have specific funding
allocations for drug abuse activities in fiscal 1972, but did not
have such allocations in fiscal 1971.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Because of these problems, some of the figures
given here represent judgment and estimate rather than certain
fact. <br>
</font></p>

<hr>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>TOTAL FEDERAL EXPENDITURES <br>
</i></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Table 5-1 shows federal expenditures for fiscal
years 1970, 1971, and 1972 broken down by agencies. Table 5-2
shows the same expenditures broken down by functional categories.
Table </font><font size="1">5-3 shows </font><font size="2">the
requested budget for fiscal </font><font size="1">1972 </font><font
size="2">before and after the President's supplement request.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">As the tables indicate, the government will
spend about $417,601,000 on drug-abuse activities in fiscal 1972,
almost double the amount spent in fiscal 1971. Several agencies
that could not provide a breakdown of funds spent in fiscal </font><font
size="1">1971 </font><font size="2">could do so for fiscal 1972.
To avoid undue exaggeration of the increase, we have made rough
estimates of the fiscal 1971 totals.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Table 5-4 compares the project estimate of the
fiscal 1972 </font><font size="1">budget with the latest
available official government estimates.' The Project's figures
are higher. The difference can be attributed to a number of
factors, but probably the most influential is that the data for
our estimate were compiled in September and October, 1971, rather
than in June, and thus the agencies had </font><font size="2">more
time in which to survey their activities. This seems especially
important for the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration.<br>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>FEDERAL ACTIVITIES <br>
</i></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">LAw </font><font size="1">ENFORCEMENT
<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Four federal agencies have law-enforcement
responsibilities: the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs
(BNDD) and the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA)
in the Department of justice; and the Bureau of Customs and the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the Treasury Department. In
fiscal 1972, these agencies will spend $115,822,000 enforcing
laws against the illegal importation, manufacture, distribution,
and possession of narcotics and dangerous drugs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">As the product of a 1968 merger between the
Treasury Department's Federal Bureau of Narcotics and the
Department of Health, Education and Welfare's Bureau of Drug
Abuse Control, BNDD has the widest mandate. It is primarily
responsible for most of the federal government's national and
international police operations. BNDD also works with state and
local officials on cases of major importance to the total
illegal-distribution system.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">During fiscal 1972, BNDD will receive
$66,689,000.' This will represent a doubling of its
appropriations in two years. Personnel has increased almost as
rapidly-from 1,465 in fiscal 1970 to 2,319 in fiscal 1971 to
2,718 in fiscal 1972. The number of actual agents has also
increased from 884 in 1970 to 1,437 in 1971.' (Data for fiscal
1972 are not available.) Over 90 per cent of BNDD's money, or
$61,971,000, will be spent on law-enforcement activities in 1972 </font><font
size="1">.4</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">BNDD's principal predecessor, the Federal
Bureau of Narcotics, was often accused of over concentrating its
efforts against users and street dealers of narcotics and not
being seriously concerned with the higher levels of distribution.
In 1970, BNDD claimed that it had reversed this policy and was
concentrating its efforts on the higher levels of the marketing
structure. Appearing before a House Appropriations subcommittee
in March, 1970, Director John Ingersoll stated:</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">The new operational plan is a systematic
approach to developing prosecutable cases and obtaining
convictions on specifically identifiable individuals and groups
who are responsible for most of the illicit drug traffic in this
country.</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">The shift in emphasis of federal narcotic and
dangerous drug law enforcement from the addict, abuser, and small
time street peddler to the important illicit traffickers and
illegal supply sources will undoubtedly result in fewer total
arrests. But those made should have a greater impact on the
supply of narcotics and drugs available for distribution to the
consumers in this country than a larger number of less
significant arrests.,5 </font></p>

<p><font size="1">Statistics on BNDD's output confirm this shift
in policy to some extent. One would expect that such a change
would result in fewer arrests per agent because of the increased
investigatory work required. Table 5-5 shows that this appears to
be the case.</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">Consistent with this shift in priorities, BNDD
has begun analyzing the distribution systems for the various
drugs and identifying organizations and individuals involved. The
agency claims that so far it has identified nine principal and
129 secondary international drug-distribution systems and has
immobilized 870 of the 2,150 individuals identified as having
major importance in them.' For several years, there has been a
conflict between BNDD and the Bureau of Customs over operations
in foreign countries. In February, 1970, President Nixon declared
that BNDD would be the accredited agency &quot;in dealing with
foreign law-enforcement officials on narcotics questions. This
announcement apparently resolved the dispute.</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">During the last two years, there has been a
major expansion of BNDD's foreign operations. The Bureau had 13
foreign offices in fiscal 1969, 16 in 1970, and 28 in 1971.
During these three years, the number of agents assigned to
foreign posts rose from 26 to 27 to 6111 Of the 50 new agents
requested in the original 1972 budget, 15 will be assigned to
foreign offices, and new offices will be opened in South America
and the Far East.' From President Nixon's supplemental budget
request, $1 million will be allocated to BNDD for international
training and technicalassistance activities.&quot; <br>

</font></p>

<p><font size="1">One of the chronic difficulties of law
enforcement in the drug field is corruption, and the old Federal
Bureau of Narcotics had a substantial problem. In the words of
Attorney-General John Mitchell: </font></p>

<p><font size="1">There was considerable lack of integrity on the
part of many of the agents of predecessor organizations. . . .
Some of them have been indicted. Others have had administrative
procedures instituted against them, and a lot of them have left.
I believe that it is being overcome.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="1">However, because there is so much money in the
drug trade, internal corruption will undoubtedly continue to be a
problem. Indeed, the pursuit of higher-level (and richer)
traffickers will increase the stakes and the temptations. So far,
BNDD has not been involved in any major scandals-a considerable
accomplishment. <br>
</font></p>

<p><img src="img00022.gif" align="bottom" width="1265"
height="948"> </p>

<p><font size="1">The Bureau of Customs is responsible for the
prevention of smuggling. In fiscal 1972, the Customs budget for
antidrug activities will be $40.5 million, $15 million of which
will come from the supplemental budget request.&quot; Customs
officials state that </font><font size="2">they will actually
spend about $52 million in this area during fiscal 1972. This
estimate is based on a performance-measurement system that uses
random time-sample analysis to determine the allocation of effort
of Customs personnel. Based on this same measurement system,
Customs estimates that $31,600,000 was actually spent on antidrug
activities during fiscal 1971.1' The results of Customs activity,
as measured by the quantity of material seized and the number of
arrests made, is shown in Table 5-6.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">For all categories except dangerous drugs, the
quantity of material seized in fiscal 1971 exceeded that of the
previous year, with heroin and cocaine showing the most dramatic
increases. Customs officials say that about 5 per cent of their
seizures are made as a result of tips and 95 per cent as a result
of &quot;cold searches'@--situations in which suspicions were
based on conduct at the time of entry rather than on advance
information.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Law Enforcement Assistance Administration
(LEAA) was created in June, 1968, under Title I of the Omnibus
Crime Control and Safe Streets Act. Its stated purpose is to
offer &quot;large scale financial and technical aid to strengthen
criminal justice at every level throughout the
nation.&quot;&quot; LEAA is thus a major link between federal
funds and technical expertise and state and local narcoticslaw
enforcement. The major types of financial aid to states and
cities are as follows:<br>
</font></p>

<p><img src="img00023.gif" align="bottom" width="1263"
height="711"> </p>

<p><font size="2">1. Planning grants-allocated to states
according to population for the creation of statewide,
comprehensive law-enforcement improvement plans.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">2. Block-action grants-allocated to states
according to population to carry out specific improvement plans.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">3. Discretionary action grants-awarded at
LEAA's discretion for anticrime programs, with emphasis on
special aid to cities.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Some information on drug-abuse expenditures is
available for the block-grant and discretionary-grant programs.
Some of the planning funds are undoubtedly spent in this area as
well, but the amount is not obtainable.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Block-grant funds awarded to state governments
are normally spent in accordance with the comprehensive
law-enforcement improvement plans formulated by the recipient.
The amount allocated to drug-law enforcement in part reflects the
judgment of the states as to the severity of their drug-abuse
problems. The discretionary-grant program represents LEAA's own
allocation of resources to antidrug activities. The agency
emphasizes attempts to improve upon interjurisdictional
law-enforcement techniques, particularly in metropolitan areas
where city-suburban cooperation is important. To some extent, it
seems to try to fill a gap left by BNDD, as that agency now
focuses increasing attention on national drug-trafficking systems
rather than on smaller local groups.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In fiscal 1971, the states allocated $3,172,879
of block-grant funds to 26 programs designed to improve
law-enforcement techniques and efforts, and LEAA used $2,713,206
of its discretionary funds.&quot; Information on the funding
levels for LEAA-financed, drug-abuse programs during 1972 will
not be available until after the close of the fiscal year, since
the grantees of the block grants do not have to file detailed
reports until then. LEAA has not, apparently, analyzed the
comprehensive plans to provide any prediction. Nor has the agency
yet finalized its own plans for the discretionary-grant program.
(In the tables we have presented, it is assumed that
LEAA-financed, antidrug expenditures will remain constant in
1972.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Internal Revenue Service has long had a
more general law enforcement role, in that tax laws are
frequently used against organized crime and other special
offenders. Undoubtedly, the IRS has spent money on investigations
and prosecutions related to drug abuse in the past. However, the
$7,500,000 proposed for IRS in President Nixon's supplemental
budget represents the first funds clearly earmarked for this
purpose. The money is to be used to hire 541 new auditors and
investigators and to pay the incidental expenses of their
investigations.&quot; (The 5 per cent reduction in government
personnel has thrown this plan into uncertainty.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Other federal agencies are involved in law
enforcement to a limited extent, as described below.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The President's supplemental budget contained
the first specifically identifiable funds for drug-abuse-related
activities in the Department of Defense. It is not yet possible
to determine the proportion of these funds that will be used for
enforcement purposes, but it will probably be small. The
Department already has its own enforcement system for violators.
(The tables in this chapter do not include any estimate for
Department of Defense law enforcement.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">During fiscal 1971, the Department of
Agriculture conducted an experimental marijuana-eradication
program in eleven Midwest counties. The cost of this project
($55,000) was assumed by BNDD. It has not been determined whether
this program will be expanded or dropped in fiscal 1972, or, if
it is continued, which agency will fund the program.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The federal government is also placing
considerable emphasis on foreign crop eradication. In fiscal
1970, the Agency for International Development (AID) gave $1
million to Mexico to buy three light planes, five helicopters,
remote sensing equipment, and chemicals and other eradication
equipment. Similar grants totaling $627,000 were made in 1961 and
1965, without apparent effect.&quot; It is not clear whether
additional sums have been spent since, but it seems probable.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Similar emphasis is placed upon persuading
Turkish farmers to substitute other crops for opium. According to
government officials, both loans and grants tied to this purpose
have been made, and BNDD has stated that in 1970 AID had $3
million to spend on it.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In 1971, major U.S.-Turkey agreements were
made, whereby Turkey would phase out opium production over the
ensuing years.&quot; No monetary <i>quid pro quo </i>has been
publicly announced, but presumably it is substantial. More
recently, on September 28, 1971, the State Department signed a
U.S.-Thailand Memorandum of Understanding that will make U.S. aid
available to Thailand for the purpose of controlling drug traffic
in that country.&quot; Again, no funding level has been
announced.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The United Nations has established a Fund for
Drug Control, supported by voluntary contributions from
governments and individuals. Before the Fund came into being, the
United States pledged an initial contribution of $2
million.&quot; Presumably, this has been paid, but it is not
clear which agency paid it or whether it is an annual
contribution. In the tables, it is allocated to StateAID for
fiscal 1971 contributions to international organizations. It has
not been annualized.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It is difficult to know how to handle these
assistance funds. To carry them at zero is clearly an error, but
any specific number is a guess. A recent newspaper report stated
that the total cost of the program in Turkey would be $35 million
over four years, and that the United States would pay $20 million
of it.&quot; Project staff believe it likely that the United
States will also absorb at least part of the other $15 million in
some form, and that cost overruns are always possible. Given all
the uncertainties, we have estimated State-AID expenditures at
$10 million per year, starting in fiscal 1972. This is probably a
little conservative. <br>
</font></p>

<hr>

<p align="center"><font size="1">TREATMENT <b>AND </b>REHABILITATION
<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The principal federal agency concerned with
treatment and rehabilitation is the National Institute of Mental
Health (NIMH) within HEW, which operates four types of
drug-treatment programs.&quot; For three of these
programs-community Assistance, NARA inpatient, and NARA
aftercare-funding levels are known: they were $42,445,000 for
fiscal 1971 and will be $99,798,000 for fiscal 1972. Under the
fourth program, the Community Mental Health Centers Act, drug
users are only one of a number of categories of people treated,
and an accurate calculation of expenditures cannot be made.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">The Community Assistance Program has expanded
dramatically in recent years. From a budget of $3.1 million in
fiscal 1970 and $21.3 million in fiscal 1971, it has grown to
$76.8 million under the revised fiscal 1972 budget. In his
supplemental budget request, President Nixon asked for $67
million more for NIMH than was contained in the original budget;
of this, $49.8 million will be channeled into the Community
Assistance Program.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The increased emphasis on the Community
Assistance Program reflects NIMH's belief that it is most
effective and efficient to treat addicts in their home
communities rather than in a central isolated facility. Treatment
is not confined to any one method. Different centers use
different approaches or combinations of approaches. The modality
chosen for any particular center is the result of the community's
suggestion and NIMH's ratification.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">During fiscal 1971, 13,258 patients were
admitted to the 23 operational centers. NIMH estimates that about
10,000 remained enrolled. At the very end of fiscal 1971, 22
additional centers were funded; these did not accommodate any
patients during that year but will add substantially to the total
capacity in fiscal 1972. As funding more than triples in fiscal
1972, it is reasonable to expect even more increases in the
number of operational centers and enrolled patients.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Under the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act of
1966 (NARA), NIMH operates both inpatient and aftercare civil
commitment facilities. Originally, there were two central
inpatient facilities, one at Lexington, Kentucky, and the other
at Fort Worth, Texas. These facilities were generally underused,
and now, consistent with the emphasis on community treatment,
NIMH has dissociated from Fort Worth and is in the process of
opening a series of smaller, geographically dispersed incare
service facilities. The central facility at Lexington will remain
operational and will serve patients for whom no local facilities
are available. At present, about 700 people are in the inpatient
phase of civil commitment. The second phase of civil commitment
is community aftercare on an outpatient basis. NIMH has
contracted for these services with 144 different community
programs. These units are generally small. Together, they serve a
population of about 1,250. The treatment at each of these centers
is determined by NIMH personnel.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Under the Community Mental Health Centers Act,
NIMH is funding some 450 centers designed to treat people with
basic psychological problems. Many of these centers handle
drug-abuse treatment under this general mandate. Information is
not available on the number of drug users served by these centers
or the amount of money involved. (No estimate is made in the
tables.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Social and Rehabilitation Service (SRS) of
HEW, also funds rehabilitation programs through grants to state
vocationalrehabilitation agencies. In fiscal 1971, an estimated
$1,915,000 was spent for 1-000 &quot;rehabilitations,&quot; and,
in fiscal 1972, SRS expects to spend $3,093,000 for 1,600
&quot;rehabilitations.&quot; The criterion for rehabilitation is
the ability to secure and maintain employment.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Because of the increased focus on drug-use in
the military, the Veterans Administration is accelerating its
drug-rehabilitation program. In fiscal 1971, the VA inaugurated
its first five drugabuse treatment units. Originally, the VA had
planned to open 13 more centers in fiscal 1972 and another 14 in
fiscal 1973. However, the President's supplemental budget request
included $14.1 million to enable the VA to open all 27 new units
this year.&quot; Each of these units will be located in a VA
hospital and will accommodate approximately 15 inpatients. The
primary treatment modality will be methadone maintenance, with
patients inducted for four to six weeks in the hospital and then
continued on an outpatient basis. VA officials say that they
expect to treat about 6,000 patients under this program during
fiscal 1972.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">As of July 1, 1971, the Office of Economic
Opportunity (OEO) had 20 active grants budgeted at $12.3
million.&quot; OEO concentrates its treatment and rehabilitation
activities on programs for young drug users and assistance to
community groups. OEO funded treatment modalities range from
therapeutic communities to methadone maintenance. Some of the
projects also include an education component, but it is not
possible to extract the amount of money spent by OEO for this
purpose. For fiscal 1972, OEO has requested $18 million for
drug-abuse-related expenditures. The neighborhood health-center
concept would receive increased attention under this plan,
according to OEO.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Some Model Cities funds from the Department of
Housing and Urban Development have been used to operate
drug-treatment and rehabilitation centers. Because the funding
mechanism is the block grant, the only information available from
HUD is on fiscal 1971 expenditures-no accurate estimate can be
made for fiscal 1972. The majority of these treatment and
rehabilitation programs are directed toward young users. Services
at the different centers range from outpatient counseling to
comprehensive inpatient care. In fiscal 1971, there were 21
treatment and rehabilitation programs run in 13 states, the
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands at a
total cost to HUD of $9,343,000.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Job Corps, part of the Department of Labor,
will spend $200,000 in fiscal 1972 on three drug-demonstration
projects. &quot;The purpose of the . . . projects is to develop
effective program models for man-power training programs to
prevent and control drug misuse by disadvantaged
adolescents.&quot;&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Total LEAA expenditures for treatment and
rehabilitation in 1971 amounted to just over $16.6 million. LEAA
estimates that it allocated over $4.5 million of its own fiscal
1971 discretionary funds to treatment and rehabilitation
programs, and the states spent $12.1 million of the block-action
grants for similar purposes.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">LEAA officials say that the funding rationale
is the relationship between drugs and crime. The medical and
psychological needs of addicts must be treated to eliminate their
criminal acts. These treatment and rehabilitation programs
contain a strong crime-prevention component, most observable in
the treatment and rehabilitation centers run for predelinquent
addicts. Treatment varies from the use of antagonist drugs to
therapeutic communities, and many of the centers offer both
inpatient and outpatient clinical care.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Bureau of Prisons runs two similar
treatment and rehabilitation programs. First, under Title 11 of
the Narcotics Addict Rehabilitation Act (NARA), inpatient and
aftercare treatment are provided. The budget for fiscal 1972 is
$2,118,924. The program has the capacity to treat 600 inpatients
for an average of 18 months apiece. The actual population in
treatment, as of August, 1971, was about 375.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Bureau of Prisons does not dispense any
maintenance drugs. Rehabilitation programs center on educational
and vocational training, individual, group, and family
counseling, and &quot;milieu therapy.&quot; The Bureau also runs
a &quot;para-NARA&quot; program, which serves drug-dependent
persons who, for one reason or another, do not qualify under NARA
Title 11. This program, operationally similar to NARA, will be
budgeted at $655,955 in fiscal 1972, and the five centers will
eventually treat a total population of 250. Four of the centers
are now operational, and 104 people are enrolled. The fifth
center is about to inaugurate operations with an initial
population of 39. These figures are exclusive of the Fort Worth
facility, which the Bureau of Prisons has just recently taken
over from NIMH. It is expected that this facility will increase
NARA and para-NARA capacity by only 200. The additional budgetary
allotment required was not available.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The President's supplemental budget request
included the first large-scale identifiable funds for Department
of Defense drugabuse activities. The total request for the
department was $34,255,000, but a functional breakdown of this
budget is not available. The Army will receive $19,699,000, the
Navy $3,231,000, and the Air Force $11,295,000. Of the Army's
funds, $18.2 million will be channeled into a new program-the
Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Program. The
objectives are defined as follows:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Prevention of alcohol and drug abuse</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Identificaton of drug abusers</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Detoxification of drug abusers</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Rehabilitation of drug abusers, either short
term in Army facilities or long term under the Veterans
Administration</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Suppression of illegal drug distribution</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Collection of statistics and dissemination of
information</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">How much money is to be allocated for each
objective is not known, but it is likely that the primary
emphasis will be on treatment and rehabilitation. The Navy and
the Air Force will establish similar programs, funded,
respectively, at $2.8 million and $11.1 million. The remainder of
the DOD funds will probably be used for research.&quot;<br>
</font></p>

<hr>

<p align="center"><font size="1"><b>RESEARCH<br>
</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">The National institute of Mental Health is the
principal vehicle for government research on drug abuse. As
concern about the problem has mounted, so has the NIMH
drug-research budget. The growth curve is shown in Table 5-7,
prepared for the House Select Committee on Crime by the director
of NIMH. Probably the most important of the &quot;other
divisions&quot; mentioned in the table is psychopharmacology,
which is concerned primarily with the use of drugs in the
treatment of mental illness.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The supplemental budget presented by the
President in June, 1971, increased the total amount for
drug-abuse research in fiscal 1972 to $30.7 million. The
allocation of this amount is not known.</font> </p>

<p><img src="img00024.gif" align="bottom" width="1300"
height="1284"> </p>

<p><font size="2">NIMH research covers a variety of drugs,
including marijuana and the opiates, amphetamines, barbiturates,
and hallucinogens. In fiscal 1970, the only year for which we
have figures, the distribution was as follows:<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><i>Drugs</i> <i>$ in millions</i></font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Barbiturates 5.3</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Opiates 3.8</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Amphetamines 2.8</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Marijuana 2.3</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Hallucinogens 1.8</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Other .3<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="1">TOTAL </font><font size="2">16.3<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">This total is higher than the total shown in
Table 5-7, which notes only $15.6 million for 1970. Probably the
material presented to Congress is correct, and the information in
the breakdown by drugs represents preliminary estimates.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Drug research draws on the disciplines of
chemistry, pharmacology, sociology, psychology, psychiatry, and
epidemiology, alone or in combination. There are no breakdowns by
discipline, but NIMH does have a basic categorization of the
areas within which it makes grants and contracts:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">1. Systematic, controlled evaluation of
currently promising treatment-program techniques</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">2. Development of treatment agents/devices for
use in the treatment of drug dependence</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">3. Clinical studies of the effects of treatment
drugs and abuse drugs</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">4. Surveys and instrument development to
determine incidence, prevalence, and patterns of drug abuse:</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">a. among students</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">b. among other groups (hippies, psychiatric
patients, etc.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">c. New York City Narcotic Addict Register</font>
</p>

<ol>
    <li><font size="2">Psycho-sociological studies of drug abuse
        and the abuser to determine the motivation for use,
        environmental influences, effects on personality,
        characteristics of drug-using subculture, etc. </font></li>
    <li><font size="2">6. Legal aspects of controlled drugs to
        explore alternative types of legal control systems</font>
    </li>
</ol>

<p><font size="2">7. Genetic studies to determine effects of
drugs on chromosomes and offspring:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">a. marijuana</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">b. LSD</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">c. amphetamines and barbiturates <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">8. Use of animal models for studies of abuse
potential of drugs</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">9. Exploration of mechanisms of action of drugs
on the brain at the biochemical, neurophysiological, and
behavioral levels:<br>
a. opiates</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">b. marijuana</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">c. amphetamines and barbiturates</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">d. LSD</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">10. Improved chemical methods for systematic
and reliable detection of drug abuse</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">11. Chemical studies of plant alkaloids to
determine presence of hallucinogenic properties; to determine
geographic origin of opium</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">12. Development of methods/preparation of
natural and synthetic marijuana</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">13. Development of materials/methods for
campaign on prevention and education of drug abuse</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">14. Training</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">15. Fellowships and scientist development
awards. 31</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Many of these categories include only a small
number of projects.</font> </p>

<p><img src="img00025.gif" align="bottom" width="1296"
height="437"> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Addiction Research Center (ARC) in
Lexington, Kentucky, budgeted at about $0.8 million per year, is
NIMH's major facility for intramural drug research. It has two
major functions -the investigation of the addiction potential of
various drugs before they reach commercial channels, and the
development of antagonists to opiates. Basic research into the
nature of drug action, abuse, and dependence is not a primary
function, although ARC has some highly respected researchers who
have done distinguished work in these areas.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In the last two years, there has been a major
push to do research on marijuana. The total expenditure has gone
from $1.5 million in fiscal 1969 to $2.8 million in fiscal 1971.
Fiscal 1972 data are not available. Much of the past expenditure
($1.1 million in fiscal 1971) is done on contract, a procedure
&quot;utilized by the NIMH when it is important that the
government define precisely what needs to be done, how it shall
be done, and what the product will be.&quot; Between 1968 and
1972, NIMH did not use contracts for research in any area of drug
abuse except marijuana.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Social and Rehabilitation Service, also a
part of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, plans to
allocate approximately $400,000 for research in fiscal 1972. The
bulk of this money will be used to investigate techniques by
which the vocational and social services performed by this agency
may be better utilized to facilitate therapeutic programs
designed for young drug abusers </font><font size="1">.14</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The National Commission on Marijuana and Drug
Abuse was officially established on March 22, 1971, for a
two-year period. It has a dual purpose: First, it is currently
analyzing the marijuana situation and will, in March, 1972,
recommend any desirable modifications of public policy. During
its second year, the Commission will explore some of the broader
aspects of drug usage under a mandate to investigate the causes
of drug abuse. The budget for fiscal 1972 is estimated to be
about $1 million, allocated entirely to general expenses and
research.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The President's supplemental budget allocated
$2.1 million to the Agricultural Research Service of the
Department of Agriculture. The money will be used to develop
techniques to detect and destroy illicitly grown
narcotic-producing plants without causing adverse ecological
effects.&quot; Two other federal agencies, LEAA and BNDD-both
within the Justice Department-conduct research programs,
primarily to improve law-enforcement techniques.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">LEAA research funds come from the block-action
grant and discretionary-grant programs discussed above and from
programs conducted by LEAA's National Institute of Law
Enforcement and Criminal justice (NILECI).&quot; During the past
two fiscal years, the funding levels for research and education
were as follows: <br>
</font></p>

<p><img src="img00026.gif" align="bottom" width="1284"
height="410"><br>
</p>

<p><font size="1">Figures for fiscal 1972 are not yet available.
The discretionary grants program has not been finalized, and most
states have not yet submitted their plans for the fiscal 1972
block-action grants. In the tables, we assume that the funding
will remain the same as in fiscal 1971.</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">LEAA-funded research has emphasized two project
areas: investigation of possible relationships between drug use
and aggressive behavior and crime, and evaluations of
LEAA-funded, community-based treatment and rehabilitation
projects. It can be expected that LEAA research programs will
retain this thrust in fiscal 1972.</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">BNDD research is limited to projects directly
related to law enforcement, such as the abuse potential of
particular drugs or the market characteristics of the
drug-distribution system. In fiscal 1971, BNDD had a research
staff of 20 and a total research budget of $1,383,000. For fiscal
1972, BNDD originally asked for a research budget of $1,467,000;
the increase, however, would have covered only the cost of
annualization of positions, and would not have resulted in any
additional activities.&quot; The President's supplemental budget
allocated an additional $2 million to BNDD &quot;for development
and implementation of new technology for detection, surveillance,
communications and automatic data processing as tools in the
enforcement of drug laws.&quot;&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">Other federal agencies are conducting research
into nonlawenforcement aspects of drug abuse. For the most part,
however, the following programs are limited in scope and
peripheral to the central goals and purposes of the agency
involved.</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">The Job Corps has budgeted $120,000 for a
national drug survey of 16 Job Corps centers in fiscal 1972, to
obtain information </font><font size="2">about knowledge,
attitudes, and patterns of drug use among different subcultural
groups of Job Corps enrollees.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Department of Transportation has been
conducting research on the effects of drugs on drivers and
driving. DOT says that in fiscal 1972 it will spend an estimated
$250,000 on the following studies:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Incidence of drugs in people admitted to a
university clinic after auto accidents</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Investigation of a sample of 1,000 fatally
injured drivers for drugs</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Incidence of drugs in drivers who are not
involved in accidents</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Simulation studies of drug effects</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">A study of the driving record of heroin addicts
before and after addiction and while on methadone </font></p>

<p><font size="2">In fiscal 1972, the Veterans Administration
plans to spend $250,000 for a general research program concerned
primarily with the biological and behavioral aspects of drug
addiction and to be conducted in Veterans Administration
hospitals.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is
investing a limited amount of funds in drug-abuse-related
research. A budget breakdown is not available, but the agency
estimates that these projects will consume four and a half
man-years of time in fiscal 1972. Two of FDA's most important
activities in this area are reviewing methadone-treatment
programs for medical soundness and reviewing proposals to market
methadone as a proven rather than an experimental drug.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Finally, part of the Department of Defense's
supplemental budget will be used for research activities. The
Army will get $1.5 million for research, development, testing,
and evaluation in fiscal 1972; the Navy and Air Force will be
given lesser. amounts.&quot; Information on specific projects is
not yet available.<br>
</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="1">EDUCATION, PREVENTION, AND TRAINING<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">It is not always possible to distinguish
sharply between this category and other categories. For example,
funds for BNDD programs to educate local law-enforcement officers
are included under law enforcement; treatment and rehabilitation
programs undoubtedly include some money for training the
agencies' own workers; and the line between prevention and
enforcement is not always clear. Programs in this section include
the following types of activity:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Efforts to alert the general public to the
drug-abuse problem and to explain its scope and significance</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Efforts to reach actual or potential drug
abusers and to explain the effects and dangers of drug abuse</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Programs to train education workers</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">NIMH programs to train rehabilitation workers
(because of the scope of NIMH rehabilitation programs, the
training activities are sufficiently large to warrant separation)</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Information services for persons interested in
the drug field</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In fiscal 1971, the Office of Education (CE)
budgeted approximately $6 million for drug-education programs. Of
this, $2 million was allocated to state departments of education
to train educational personnel. The other major OE endeavors in
fiscal 1971 were 26 community programs, 11 drug-education
projects initiated by local school districts, and 20
college-based pilot programs initiated and operated by students
primarily for fellow students but sometimes with a
community-outreach component.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">For fiscal 1972, the Office of Education
originally requested a budget of $6 million to continue existing
programs.&quot; As a result of a supplemental request, however,
OE will receive $13 million for drug-abuse-related programs. The
major new undertaking will be a training program called
&quot;Help Communities Help Themselves&quot;: Eight regional
centers will be inaugurated to train community people on how to
develop and maintain community education and information
programs; in the first year, OE hopes to train about 2,500
people. This project will cost about $6.5 million.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">For fiscal 1972, NIMH has budgeted $2,571,000
for public information services, a nominal increase over the
fiscal 1971 amount of $2,563,000. Part of this money will be used
by the National Clearinghouse for Drug Abuse Information, which
answers general inquiries for information by sending out NIMH
brochures and fact books. More specific requests are answered by
information specialists, who send out reprints of published
articles. The Clearinghouse has also developed a fairly
comprehensive standard bibliography as well as a computerized
information system that lists, indexes, and abstracts published
articles in the field and conducts searches in response to
individual requests.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The NIMH and the Department of Defense and
Justice are cosponsoring a special advertising campaign designed
to counteract peer pressure to use drugs. This campaign, in the
second of three years, has an annual cost of $150,000 equally
divided between the sponsors.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In fiscal 1972, NIMH will spend $6.9 million on
training, compared with $2.1 million budgeted in fiscal 1971.
Part of this increase will be absorbed by the expansion of a
program to develop educational materials and to train lawyers,
ministers, and others who spend part of their time working with
drug-dependent persons.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Office of Economic Opportunity has awarded
a $420,000 grant for fiscal 1972 for the inauguration of a
National Training Institute in Washington, D.C., to provide six
months of intensive training for former addicts working on local
projects, with follow-up training, if necessary.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In fiscal 1971, $3,066,000 of HUD's Model
Cities funds were used for 37 programs in the area of education,
prevention, or training. Within this broad category, the states
have programmed many diverse projects. Some have used their funds
to develop curricula for drug-education programs in the schools;
others have funded workshops for teachers and counselors; still
others have directed their efforts toward the general community.
At least one program has been run for law-enforcement officers.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">The job Corps, within the Department of Labor,
will spend $40,000 in fiscal 1972 to develop, collect, and
distribute educational material deemed appropriate and relevant
to the job Corps population.&quot; This project will also help
Job Corps staffs improve their understanding of the problems of
drugs and drug abusers.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">BNDD also operates a public-education campaign.
In fiscal 1971, this division was staffed by 26 people at a cost
of $1,215,000. The education division responds to requests from
the general public for information on the drug problem and
preventive programs. This division also provides materials and
films upon request and arranges for speakers for national, state,
and regional programs. In fiscal 1971, BNDD personnel made 1,500
speeches to an estimated audience of 150,000. They also made 191
radio and television appearances. These figures represent
significant declines from the preceding year, apparently the
result of a policy decision to place highest priority on
addressing groups of people capable of establishing ongoing
drug-prevention programs rather than the public at' large. In
fiscal 1972, this division will again consist of 26 people but at
a cost of $1,251,000. This budget increase, however, will cover
only annualization of positions.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">LEAA estimates that approximately $20.2 million
of its fiscal 1971 funds were spent on education, prevention, and
training, more than was spent in any other drug-abuse category.
The major objective of LEAA's program is &quot;to provide
students and adults with the knowledge necessary to make
intelligent decisions concerning the personal use of addicting or
habituating drugs and other harmful substances.&quot; LEAA has
developed the concept of a &quot;concerned community&quot; that
must be made aware of the nature and magnitude of the problem
before it can respond. The agency stresses four programs:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">1. Coordination of local and state public
education and information programs to attain maximum
participation and efficiency </font></p>

<p><font size="2">2. Implementation of health-information
programs in every school at the earliest feasible grade level</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">3. Development of educational programs,
seminars, and work-</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">shops designed to provide accurate information
for adults</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">4. Predelinquent counseling services through
the use of neighborhood information centers.&quot; <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The funding level of these programs in fiscal
1972 is not yet known.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">THE SPECIAL ACTION OFFICE<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">In his special message to the Congress on June
17, 1971, the President proposed the temporary establishment of a
Special Action Office of Drug Abuse Prevention accountable
directly to the President. Pending congressional approval, the
President, through an executive order, instituted the position of
Special Consultant for Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs to fulfill,
to the extent legally possible, the duties of the proposed
Special Action Office. Under this revised organizational plan, it
would become the responsibility of the Special Action Office to
coordinate and direct all the drug-abuse activities of the
various federal agencies, with the exception of those dealing
with the problems of law enforcement.&quot; The President has
requested $3 million in fiscal 1972 for the staff and
administrative costs of the Special Action Office.&quot;<br>

that 500 kilograms of marijuana per day go from Mexico to the
United States. This comes to about 400,000 pounds per year. An
average price of $25 per pound F.O.B. Mexican border does not
seem unreasonable, based on many sources of information. The
exact figures depend, of course, on one's estimate of marijuana
use and average price. A case can be made for almost any figure

Great Britain<br>
</font><i><font size="4">by Edgar May<br>
</font></i></center> </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"><br>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Background * The Clinics * Law Enforcement *
Research * The Statistics * Results * Personal Observations<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">After a decade of spiraling narcotics
addiction in England, the trend was reversed in 1970. </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The British narcotics problem admittedly is
minor when compared with that of the United States. England had
never counted more than 3,000 narcotics addicts; estimates in the
United States range from 150,000 to 250,000. However, while
American drug experts warn of a continuously growing number of
addicts, Britain's Home Office recently reported a drop of almost
8 per cent, the first since the drug problem became a serious
national concern.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The slowdown had already begun in 1969, when
the annual increase of addicts was held to a trickle, one year
after the government tightened its narcotics policies by limiting
the prescribing of heroin to staff physicians of government-run
drug clinics. Previously, any general physician was permitted to
prescribe heroin. Until the clinic system had been operating for
a year, the number of narcotics addicts in England doubled every
-sixteen months. The reversal of this trend has been accompanied
by a significant drop in new addicts. In 1968, a total of 1,476
previously unknown cases were reported. In 1969, the figure was
1,030, and by 1970 it had dropped to 711.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">These encouraging figures, however, concern
only a part of the British drug-abuse problem, albeit the
toughest and the one over which there is the most public concern.
But addicts and abusers of amphetamines and barbiturates are not
included in this count. Furthermore, there is a far greater and
increasing army of marijuana and hashish users, for which there
is no accurate tally.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">But, while the latest statistics may give the
English drug scene a more optimistic appearance than it deserves,
the bizarre anecdotes that have been published in both the
English and American press may have colored the past picture with
more despair than is justified.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In the twitching kaleidoscope that is
Picadilly Circus, the scene is as harsh and distorted as the
electric letters that flash their spasmodic messages from high
about the throng. The pallid young addicts, staggering out of
doorways to panhandle enough for a fix, casting furtive glances
at passersby while pills or other drugs are exchanged . . . a jab
of a needle in the toilet of the Underground ... a hypodermic
protruding between the toes of a grimy, infected foot . . . a
spurt of fresh blood on a soiled shirt . . . a young girl
collapsing in a doorway after taking a barbiturate injection.
It's all there and more.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">These scenes may have become part of the
tourist attractions of London's Times Square, but they don't
reflect accurately the addiction problem in England. Although it
is risky to offer findings in the complex and often-disputed
field of drug addiction, some basic trends are clear:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Heroin addiction is no longer the major
&quot;hard&quot; drug problem in England. The rising tide of new
heroin addicts has been stopped and, in fact, has significantly
receded. The quantity of heroin prescribed in government clinics
continues to decline. Methadone is the most frequently used drug
in England today and is replacing heroin. But the drop in heroin
is not fully matched by the rise in methadone. New addicts tend
to be addicted to methadone rather than heroin, but the number of
newcomers addicted to anything is smaller than in previous years.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Methadone maintenance generally is not
practiced in England as it is in the United States, in that far
more English addicts inject methadone than take it orally.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">British hard-drug users often are polyaddicts,
injecting a variety of drugs, obtained both legally and
illegally. The most recent craze is the injection of
barbiturates, a particularly damaging habit that has raised the
concerns of all those working in the British drug field.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Although the backbone of the English drug
program is the government-sponsored clinic, where addicts obtain
free drugs, the phrase &quot;British clinic system&quot; is
misleading. There is very little system to the clinics beyond the
fact that they all prescribe narcotics. Clinics vary widely in
services offered, treatment approach, staff, and facilities.
Nevertheless, the clinics are credited widely with curbing the
heroin problem, while the degree of their contribution to the
problem of methadone addiction is debated. Furthermore, clinics
are considered to have had an impact on improving the total
hard-drug picture, but evidence for this generally is subjective
rather than objective and statistical.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Although there is some black-market activity
in all drugs, it appears to be on neither a major nor a very
professional scale. No one interviewed claimed that there was a
vast, hidden opiate-addict population supplying itself from the
black market.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">No one in England saw any correlation between
drug addiction and a rise in crime.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Finally, the commonly held view in the United
States that heroin addiction automatically turns the user into a
completely antisocial, unproductive misfit is simply not shared
in England. Many English addicts hold regular jobs. Estimates of
employment of all known addicts range from 40 to 50 per cent.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">But perhaps to find the most glaring
difference between the two countries, you have to go back to the
hurlyburly of Picadilly Circus. There, in a locked cabinet on a
medicine shelf at Boots the Chemist, which attracts a
disproportionate number of addicts because it is open all night,
you can find heroin tablets in small bottles. A printed-in-red
retail price list says:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Heroin 100 tablets 18 S.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">At the 1970 rate of exchange, this is $2.16.
On New York's streets, the retail price for the same amount of
heroin can run as high as $1,000.<br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <center><i><font size="2">BACKGROUND<br>
</font></i></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Unlike the United States, England has
consistently treated drug addiction as a medical problem. Even
while moving toward more restrictive policies in the drug-abuse
field, the nation has never wavered from this medical point of
view. &quot;The addict should be regarded as a sick person, he
should be treated as such and not as a criminal, provided that he
does not resort to criminal acts,&quot;' said the Brain
Committee, which formulated the first significant changes in the
country's drug laws seven years ago.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Hard-drug abuse in England, also unlike the
United States, became a problem only in the last ten years or so,
as Table 7-1 clearly indicates. In 1954, the first year
nationwide heroin statistics were available, there were only 54
identified heroin addicts. The majority of the 335 known drug
addicts that year, a total of 179, were addicted to morphine, and
most were women. Also, the majority of these addicts had become
addicted after receiving a narcotic to relieve pain related to a
lengthy illness. Among the few nontherapeutic addicts, a high
proportion were doctors and nurses 'who had experimented with
narcotics and subsequently became hooked.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Today, of course, the numbers, the reasons for
addiction, and the average addict age (see Table 7-2)<b> </b>have
all changed. For example, only 2<b> </b>per cent of the reported
addicts in 1968 were classified as therapeutic. Among heroin
addicts that year, 32<b> </b>per cent were under twenty years of
age. Men outnumbered women by more than 3<b> </b>to 1.<br>

<p> <font size="2">England differs from the United States again
in that its addicts today are not as a rule from disadvantaged
families, are not members of minority groups, and do not
&quot;turn on&quot; to blot out the economic dispair of the
ghetto. <b>&quot;On </b>the contrary,&quot; says Dr. David V.
Hawks, <b>a </b>key staff member of the Addiction Research Unit
of London's Institute of Psychiatry; &quot;those notified in the
1960's were often construed as 'middle class dropouts' whose
addiction, far from being explicable in terms of some material
disadvantage, appears to have been motivated by the deliberate
rejection of middle-class norms <b>and </b>opportunities.&quot; <br>

addicts to heroin and/or methadone.<br>

<p> <font size="2">This does not mean that the poor have escaped
heroin addiction. They have not. But they aren't-by any count-in
the majority.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The basic guidelines for Britain's drug-abuse
policy were established in 1926, a dozen years after America
passed the Harrison Act, which set the stage for the U.S.
addict-criminal doctrine. A committee chaired by Sir Humphrey
Rolleston, a prominent English physician, turned the problem over
to doctors and steered it away from the police. The Rolleston
committee said that doctors should be allowed to prescribe
narcotics to wean patients off these drugs, to relieve pain after
a prolonged cure had failed, and in cases where small doses
enabled otherwise helpless patients to perform useful tasks and
lead relatively normal lives.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The Rolleston Committee's findings were the
basis of British drug policy for almost forty years. They were
reaffirmed in general in 1961 by the Interdepartmental Committee
on Drug Addiction, chaired by Sir Russell Brain. However, the
addiction statistics began to move upward, the Brain Committee
was reconvened, and a second report was issued on July 31, 1965.
It recommended the first significant restrictions on the
prescribing of heroin and cocaine.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The report succinctly stated the motivation
and fears behind England's drug policies and their sharp
differences with those of the United States: </font> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>We have borne in mind the dilemma which faces the
    authorities responsible for the control of dangerous drugs in
    this country. If there is insufficient control it may lead to
    the spread of addictionas is happening at present. If, on the
    other hand, the restrictions are so severe as to prevent or
    seriously discourage the addict from obtaining any supplies
    from legitimate sources, [they] may lead to the development
    of an organized illicit traffic. The absence hitherto of such
    an organized illicit traffic has been attributed largely to
    the fact that an addict has been able to obtain supplies of
    drugs legally. But this facility has now been abused, with
    the result that addiction has increased.<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p> <font size="2">The Brain Committee recommended the following
changes:</font> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>1. &quot;All addicts to dangerous drugs should be notified
    to a central authority.&quot; (This authority later became
    the Chief Medical Officer of the Home Office.) </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>2. &quot;To treat addicts a number of special treatment
    centers should be established, especially in the London
    area.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>3. &quot;There should be powers for compulsory detention
    of addicts in these centers.&quot; (This recommendation later
    was rejected by the Minister of Health.) </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>4. &quot;The prescribing of heroin and cocaine to addicts
    should be limited to doctors on the staff of these treatment
    centers.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>5. &quot;It should be a statutory offence for other
    doctors to prescribe heroin and cocaine to an addict.&quot;<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p> <font size="2">The government accepted these recommendations
and incorporated them in the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1967. In
February, 1968, the compulsory notification of addicts went into
effect. By April of that year, heroin and cocaine prescribing was
restricted to doctors in the newly created treatment centers. </font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">During the almost three years that passed
between the committee's report and the effective date of its
recommendations, harddrug addiction soared. From 1964, the latest
year for which a full year's statistics were available to the
committee, to 1967, heroin addicts alone increased fourfold, from
342 to 1,299. A year later, the heroin-addict figure reached
2,240.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The committee's concern that
&quot;insufficient control may lead to the spread of
addiction&quot; was more than confirmed. Although it is unjust to
blame the British medical profession alone for the sharp rise in
addiction, the fact is that general over-prescribing and the
activities of a few medical charlatans fueled the craving for
heroin.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Some addicts were receiving prescriptions from
general practitioners for as much as 20 or more grains of heroin
a day (1,200 milligrams). Very few addicts used that amount
themselves (a dosage, incidentally, that would kill almost any
American adult). Most beneficiaries of overprescribing doctors
sold their surplus and, of course, addicted others. What is
surprising is that the Disciplinary Committee of the General
Medical Council, the policing arm of the British medical
profession, permitted this situation to continue as long at it
did.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The problem of overprescribing doctors, with
strong hints that their conduct was ethically questionable, was
discussed in print as early as 1965 in the public report of the
Brain Committee:</font> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>From the evidence before us we have been led to the
    conclusion that the major source of supply has been the
    activity of a very few doctors who have prescribed
    excessively for addicts. Thus we were informed that in 1962
    one doctor alone prescribed almost 600,000 tablets (6 million
    milligrams or 6 kilos) of heroin for addicts <font size="1">.3
    </font>The same doctor, on one occasion, prescribed 900
    tablets (9,000 milligrams) of heroin to one addict and three
    days later prescribed for the same patient another 600
    tablets (6,000 milligrams) &quot;to replace pills lost in an
    accident.&quot; Two doctors each issued a single prescription
    for 1,000 tablets (10,000 milligrams).<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p> <font size="2">Overprescribing was so extensive during the
years after the Brain Committee report and before the opening of
the clinics that pure, British-manufactured heroin was readily
and relatively inexpensively available on the black market, where
imported, illicit heroin was virtually unknown. While prices for
all consumer products rose during this period, black-market
heroin-the overprescribed surplus-held the line against inflation
and stayed at one pound sterling a grain. This meant that, for
$2.40 a day, an addict could support a heroin habit. (Today,
incidentally, British manufactured heroin is both relatively
scarce and expensive on the black market, with a sixfold increase
to six pounds, or $14.40 a grain.)</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">One psychiatrist, reviewing the years
immediately preceding the opening of the clinics, felt that
general practitioners were overprescribing to such an extent
that, for every two addicts receiving prescriptions, at least one
other was maintaining his habit from these supplies. Another
psychiatrist believed that about a third of the reported addicts
were not <i>bona fide </i>addicts at all but were merely sometime
heroin users who conned doctors into issuing regular
prescriptions that they would then sell.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">But a few doctors clearly had not been
sweet-talked by addicts into writing too-generous prescriptions.
They had purposely turned the narcotics problem into a lucrative
enterprise with the simple stroke of a pen. They wrote
prescriptions for pay-at a going rate of one pound to two pounds
per script. These were the junkie doctors whose names can be
found in almost every London clinic's case records.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">One of them, a dermatologist with a passion
for gambling, ended his prescribing days issuing orders from a
taxi parked in front of the Baker Street Tube Station. He was
nabbed on a technicality-failing to keep proper narcotics
records-spent a short period in jail, and finally had his license
to practice revoked by the General Medical Council after numerous
complaints of his activities from druggists and Home Office
officials. Another was reported to have issued prescriptions to
140 addicts with a daily average of 6 to 8 grains at the height
of his narcotics enterprise. He is also without a medical license
today. He went to jail for conspiracy to commit murder.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">While no one knowledgeable about the English
drug scene will say that the nation would not have had a
hard-drug problem had it not been for overprescribing doctors and
outright charlatans, there is consensus that overgenerous
prescriptions, whatever the doctor's motivation, helped
significantly to create the chaotic drug scene that the
government clinic program was expected to remedy.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <center><i><font size="2">THE CLINICS<br>
</font></i></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In 1970, a monthly average of 1,154 drug
addicts obtained government-paid-for heroin and/or methadone and
a little cocaine from clinics scattered throughout England and
Wales. Recently, the clinic figures have remained relatively
stable, fluctuating by fewer than 100 addicts every month. The
number of new addicts registered with clinics dropped from a
monthly average of 66 to 41 in 1971. (See Table 7-3.)</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Nevertheless, it is risky to conclude that
this relative stability in clinic enrollment reflects containment
of drug addiction in England. Some clinics appear to have set a
quota of addicts and simply do not accept, or cannot accept, more
because of staff or</font><font size="1"> facility limitations.
The slow reduction in new addicts, however, is a hopeful sign.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <img src="img00029.gif"><font size="1"> <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">There are 14 clinics in London, which has four
fifths of the country's addicts. Elsewhere, an addict may obtain
drugs at 13 special facilities or at some 42 hospital outpatient
departments These are prepared to service an occasional addict as
part of their regular outpatient program.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">The special clinics vary in every conceivable
way-in type of </font><font size="2">facility, size of patient
load, size of staff, treatment approach, and prescribing
philosophy. There is no central authority over the clinics to
provide specific guidelines for staffing or determine treatment
or prescribing policies. Because of this, it is a mistake to
refer to the English &quot;drug clinic system.&quot; There is no
common &quot;system&quot; beyond the fact that addicts may obtain
heroin and methadone from government-supported clinics.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Each clinic director is doing &quot;his own
thing,&quot; based on his own particular approach to drug
addiction. He works with the facility, staff, and budget he was
able to get from his own hospital and Regional Hospital Board,
the governing body that supervises medical care for a given area.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">These various approaches have not been
evaluated comparatively for cost or effectiveness. The addicts,
however, are usually in agreement about which are the
&quot;best&quot; clinics in a less than scientific rating system,
which might be called the &quot;Santa Claus&quot; scale. It ranks
candidates on their drug-prescribing generosity.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The lack of central direction is the result
not of careless management but rather of design. Americans often
have the impression that the British National Health Service is a
monolith that dictates everything from aspirin dispensing to
appendix removing, but the fact is that the government's Ministry
of Health has approached physicians both within and outside of
the National Health Service with the circumspection of an
impresario dealing with a diva.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">After the government accepted most of the
second Brain Committee recommendations and prepared the necessary
legislation to implement them, the Department of Health and
Social Security issued a memorandum to Regional Hospital Boards
and hospital governing groups.' The Ministry directed its memo
particularly at mental hospitals and psychiatric departments of
general hospitals. As a result, today the clinic directors are
psychiatrists, most of whom follow a general psychiatric practice
in addition to their interests in the drug field.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The Health Department memorandum included a
list of the known addicts in each Regional Hospital area. Since
most addicts were in the London area, it asked city hospitals
with psychiatric departments to plan for drug clinics. At the
same time, the Health Department asked hospitals to set up
inpatient beds for withdrawal treatment and to assess addicts who
would obtain their drugs as outpatients for the required dosage.
Today most clinics have such beds available to them.
Significantly, the &quot;how&quot;<b> </b>of operating clinics
was not described.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The decision to supply an addict with drugs
and whether to seek to substitute other drugs, the assessment of
dosage, and the method of supply rest with the clinician. It is
to be expected, however, that where possible, the dosage will be
determined by assessment during inpatient observation and that
this will usually be offered, though continued treatment cannot
be made conditional on acceptance. [This in-hospital assessment
is rarely done today, and it is clear that most clinic directors
reject this Health Department &quot;expectation.&quot;] The
organization of services will depend on the method of supplying
drugs that is adopted by clinicians. It is, however, desirable in
any area that there should be a fairly uniform approach;
otherwise, the organization of services and the sharing of the
load will be obstructed because addicts will gravitate to those
clinics where they think drugs are easiest to get. While direct
administration of drugs by the medical staff of the treatment
center is not excluded, supply by the hospital or by retail
prescription is likely to be more generally practicable.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The clinics have certain statistical reporting
obligations, both to the Health Department and the Home Office.
There is an exchange of views and information among clinic
directors and other medical staff members at periodic meetings
called by the Health Department. A department official told me
that these meetings generally are held every two months, but the
records show that such sessions are usually held on an irregular
basis. Minutes of the meetings indicate that not all clinics are
represented at every meeting and not every clinic director
attends regularly. <br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <center><font size="1">FACILITIES<br>
</font></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The differences between clinics is apparent
from inspection of their physical facilities. In the naval-base
city of Portsmouth, the clinic is in a large general hospital
tucked behind a door marked &quot;Dental Waiting Room.&quot; In
East London, the center is in its own building on the grounds of
a mental hospital. In the Denmark Hill area, it is part of the
hospital's general outpatient department.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">If you visit St. Giles Clinic in the Church of
England Community Center, you are reminded of an Alec Guinness
movie. Dr. James H. Willis, a young psychiatrist, holds court
resplendent in a white medical coat, seated behind a large wooden
table in a room marked &quot;Lecture Hall.&quot; He is flanked by
two pianos and a bass fiddle. Above and behind his head, a brass
plaque reads: &quot;The trustees of St. Giles Center gratefully
acknowledge the generous support given by the Rotary Club of
Camberwell.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">It is doubtful that the Rotarians would rush
to support the effort now going on in the lecture hall. It is
lack of such support that has prevented Dr. Willis from using a
new $192,000 building specifically constructed for his drug
clinic by the two hospitals and the Regional Hospital Board
sponsoring it. The building, which includes eight single rooms
for inpatient assessment, stood empty for more than a year after
it was completed. Public protest -exploited by local
politicians-forced the hospital to rescind its decision to bring
young addicts into the middle-class neighborhood of St. Giles.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">In his churchly retreat, Dr. Willis has no
facilities even for basic medical examinations, and patients
leave urine specimens in the center's men's room. <br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <center><font size="1">STAFFING<br>
</font></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">A most basic difference among clinics is in
the kind and size of staff that operate them. One of the most
significant contrasts is between St. Clement and Lambeth Hospital
Clinics. The staffing patterns are as follows:<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <i><font size="2">LAMBETH </font></i><font size="2">(96
active patients) <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Doctors:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Secretary:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">1<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <i><font size="2">ST. CLEMENT </font></i><font size="2">(71

</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Doctors:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">1 full time</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">1 1 </font><b><font size="1">1/2 </font></b><font
size="2">days a week</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">I psychiatric intern 1 </font><font size="1">1/2
</font><font size="2">days a week</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Social workers:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">2 full time</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Nurses:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">10 full time</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Secretary: 1<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The nurses at St. Clement function like social
workers: they counsel patients and make home calls both to
patients and to their families, relatives, or close friends.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">The Lambeth Clinic, run by Dr. Thomas H.
Bewley, a wellknown author of medical articles on the English
drug scene, is far closer to the English clinic prototype.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">The besieged Dr. Willis at St. Giles,
incidentally, was even worse off when it came to staffing. With
75 active patients and 64 inactive patients, the clinic included
three doctors, two full time and another one-third time. Although
there were two slots for social workers, both were temporarily
empty. Dr. Willis has no nursing help. His only other assistance
comes from a secretary and a hospital porter, who acts as
factotum around his piano-flanked emporium.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">St. Clement, in terms of staff time for the
addict, is clearly exceptional. It was originally intended as a
day hospital where an addict would come for the entire day,
returning to his home only at night. The original staffing
pattern was retained when the clinic was turned into what can be
described more accurately as a day center that addicts of the
clinic may or may not attend. There is a ping-pong table, art
classes, and a &quot;fixing room&quot; where addicts can inject
themselves. Individual and group therapy sessions also are held
in the day center.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Among all London clinics, the amount of
social-work time provided to addicts varies from 475 hours per
week (St. Clement) to none, according to a questionnaire filled
out by the clinics themselves.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Because of the difference in staff time
between St. Clement and Lambeth, the addict's relationship to
these clinics is vastly different. At St. Clement, each social
worker and nurse has about ten cases. They know each addict by
his first name, and the easy, relaxed relationship that comes
with familiarity is evident. One addict, for example, came in to
show his nurse pictures of his recent wedding and to thank her
for her congratulatory telegram.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">At Lambeth, the lone social worker, who
provides twenty hours a week, has a caseload of 30 addicts out of
the 96 active with the clinic. Of the 30, she estimated that she
has what she called <i>&quot;a </i>deep relationship&quot; with a
half dozen. &quot;They get a good half hour a week.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Of the clinic's work, she said: &quot;We're
containing it, regularizing it a bit; but, we're not treating it.
I think I do first aid a lot.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">At St. Clement, staff members were slightly,
but not much, more encouraging. Not only did this clinic
represent the most concentrated staff effort with addicts, but
its patients resemble American ghetto addicts more closely than
any other London group.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">St. Clement is a 128-bed mental hospital in
East London, an area that in terms of income and class-but not
color-can be compared to New York's Harlem or Bedford-Stuyvesant.
The addiction clinic of St. Clement serves patients from the
surrounding neighborhoods, the bleak row houses that bring to
mind a Charles Dickens novel. Eighty per cent of St. Clement's
addiction clinic customers are East End boys; the other 20 per
cent come from the far more affluent middle- and upper-class West
End.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">While an estimated 10 per cent of the East End
population is colored (i.e., Negro, Indian, Pakistani), only one
of the clinic's 100 patients is half-Negro. This appears to
reflect accurately the fact that in England few
&quot;colored&quot; are involved with narcotic drugs.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The clinic is located on the hospital grounds
in a separate pre-fah building constructed especially for this
use at a cost of 14,000 pounds, or $33,600. The annual operating
cost for salaries and drugs is estimated by its director to be
about the same amount.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Psychiatrist John Denham is both clinic
director and head of the St. Clement Hospital. Much of the
day-to-day operation of the clinic fell on Dr. Margaret Tripp,
the full-time psychiatrist who served at the clinic from the
summer of 1968, when it opened, to 1971.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Neither Dr. Denham nor Dr. Tripp makes any
grand claims for the clinic, even though they, and it, have
received considerable publicity in U.S. media (Look magazine,
various television and radio networks). Dr. Denham has a thick
file of letters in response to this publicity requesting
permission to visit and interview him. He does not trade on this
notoriety.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">As is true of virtually all other clinics, St.
Clement's heroin dispensing is dropping monthly-from 214 grams in
March, 1969, to 73 grams in May, 1970. Methadone, both ampoules
for injection and oral, has increased at St. Clement, but not in
proportion to the drop in heroin. Dr. Denham attributes this
heroin reduction to the use of methadone, to more conservative
prescribing, and to greater expertise among clinic doctors. He
readily admits to the confusion that apparently hit every clinic
in the opening period of 1968. &quot;A drug addict presented
himself and said he needed six grains of heroin a day. We knew he
could do with two, but that he would settle for four. It was as
haphazard as that.29</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The same kind of candor is evident in a paper
published by Dr. P. H. Connell, another of the early pioneers in
drug-addiction control in England.' Reporting on 107 narcotics
users attending a London clinic between March, 1968, and
February, 1969, Dr. Connell acknowledged that some of these
patients had become addicted to drugs by the clinic.<br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <center><font size="1">REGISTRATION<br>
</font></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">How do you begin obtaining free drugs?</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Some of the addicts interviewed are convinced
it is getting harder to get on the rolls. Some say that, for a
new addict to get on, be has to buy black-market narcotics for a
while and then show wicked withdrawal symptoms.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Doctors discount the severity of these
statements but acknowledge that they are getting more
conservative. Interclinic monthly heroin and methadone
prescription quantities are distributed among the clinics, and
this may have developed a touch of competition to stay in the
range of low prescribers. At St. Clement, for example, a monthly
graph is kept showing its standing against the all-London
average.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Doctors agree that identifying an addict and
prescribing the correct quantity of drugs is the toughest part of
their jobs. They use words like &quot;haggling&quot; and
&quot;bargaining&quot; sessions to describe the difficulties of
deciding how much an addict should receive.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The Health Department's suggestion of
in-hospital assessment before prescribing to addicts generally is
not part of the procedures of the London clinics. An occasional
applicant may be sent for observation for several days, but this
is the exception and not the rule.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In Portsmouth, however, Dr. Ian Christie will
not accept a new patient unless he agrees to three days of
hospitalization to determine the kind and size of his habit, or,
for that matter, if indeed he has one.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In London, addicts arriving at a clinic for
the first time, or to reapply, usually are given at least two
interviews. The first may be with a nurse or social worker and
the second with a clinic psychiatrist. After acceptance, addicts
generally report once every week to their psychiatrist or social
worker. Some are requested to come in several times a week, while
others, who may be more stable, are permitted to report every two
weeks.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Before acceptance, one, and sometimes several,
urine tests are scheduled, usually two or more days apart.
Drug-positive urine tests play a key role in the decision-making
process.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Urine tests, incidentally, are not regularly
scheduled for every addict after he has been accepted by a
clinic. Their frequency varies from clinic to clinic. At St.
Giles, Dr. Willis formerly demanded only sporadic urine tests.
Now, however, every patient gives a sample at each clinic visit.
In other clinics, it appears that tests are made when there is
some suspicion of other than clinic-prescribed drug use.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">A key step in the preacceptance interview
procedure is the completion of a form outlining the addict's
biography, his drug history, and his physical characteristics.
This is sent to the Home Office, where it is compared with the
master list of registered addicts. The procedure helps to
identify previously unknown addicts and to prevent duplicate
registering at two or more clinics.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Have addicts succeeded in getting on the rolls
of two different clinics? Yes, but how many or how often is
difficult to document. At St. Clement, Dr. Denham does not
remember a case where the Home Office check produced duplicate
registration. However, he does recall an incident indicating that
the problem is real. Not long after the clinic opened, a boy,
while stoned, told his fellow addicts that he was obtaining drugs
from two clinics. This came to the attention of the staff, and a
nurse was sent to the clinic closest to St. Clement. Seven
addicts were identified as St. Clement boys and five others
confessed to duplicate registration. At the time, this
represented 12 per cent of the St. Clement caseload.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">&quot;Did that surprise you?&quot; I asked Dr.
Denham.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">&quot;At the time, it annoyed me.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Dr. Connell, in his study of 107 drug users,
also found that four had been attending other clinics, where they
requested help without, of course, acknowledging the duplication.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">From observation, it appeared that a seasoned
addict with a long Home Office or clinic record, or both, had
much less difficulty in re-registering at a clinic than a
previous &quot;unknown.&quot; Dr. Bewley permitted me to sit in
on a series of interviews with addicts applying to the Lambeth
clinic. All had been previously interviewed by the clinic's
part-time psychiatrists, who also sat in on these second
interviews.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">My notes for this session are as follows:</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">1. Male, out of prison since May 1. Was with
Lambeth a year ago, had received 200 mg. daily of heroin and
methadone; long criminal record, most recent possession of
burglar tools, <i>cannabis; </i>told to return for urine test.
Dr. Bewley indicated he probably will be reregistered with 20 mg.
methadone a day as starter. </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">2. Male, long criminal record, now under
three-year suspended sentence; long drug history, longest period
off drugs was six weeks; told to come back for urine test. Dr.
Bewley indicated he probably will be put on clinic rolls. </font>
</p>

<p> <font size="1">3. Male, 23, in and out of series of building
industry jobs; said he started with drugs at 16, shooting heroin
and methadone at 20; said now buying six ampoules of methadone a
day on black market at $1.20 per ampoule or $7.20 for day's
supply; no criminal record; first urine test showed methadone;
told to come back after weekend for another urine test. Bewley
estimated there was a 50-50 chance he would not be back. If he
comes and test is positive, he probably will be accepted. </font>
</p>

<p> <font size="1">Dr. Connell, in his study of the previously
cited 107 drug users at a London Clinic, found a large dropout
rate between urine tests. &quot;Refusal to prescribe at first
attendance, whilst awaiting results of urinalysis, led to a high
incidence of failed reattendance. Thus 92 per cent prescribed
heroin reattended, whilst only 35 per cent prescribed no drugs
returned.&quot; This was true, even though 22 out of 36 who had
been given no drugs had positive urine tests.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">This led Dr. Connell to conclude: &quot;In
view of the essential need for accurate diagnosis, it seems
inescapable that a prescribing method of management should not be
adopted until firm evidence of daily use is obtained by, say,
three consecutive positive urines collected on different days and
over a period of ten days or more to take into account the fact
that methadone is excreted more slowly than morphine.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="1">4. Female, 23, no previous history with
clinic; arrested four times, shoplifting, abuse of floor walker;
said she was taking 130 mg. heroin daily obtained from black
market. She was turned down.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">The psychiatrist who first interviewed the
girl acknowledged, as did Dr. Bewley, that much of this
decision-making process is guesswork. Will this girl now go out
and steal enough merchandise to fuel what may be a drug habit?
Will she overshoot herself to convince Lambeth or another clinic
that she really is addicted? No one could answer these questions.<br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <center><font size="1">DRUG DISPENSING</font></center> </p>

<p> <font size="1">None of the London addicts receives his drugs
from the medical staff in the clinics. Rather, a prescription is
mailed directly </font><font size="2">to the druggist of the
addict's choice. Only on rare occasions does the addict receive a
prescription personally-for example, if it is clear that the post
office cannot deliver it in time to fill an immediate need.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Each prescription form is filled out by the
clinic physician, generally for a week's supply. Prescription
blanks are kept under lock and key, for there is a black-market
price on blank National Health Service prescription forms.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Although a week's order may be on one
prescription, the addict must collect his supplies from the
druggist daily. On Saturday, he generally receives two days'
supply because of Sunday closing. Black-market prices for drugs,
incidentally, are highest on Sundays, because of weekend demands
by occasional users and addicts who have shot up their two-day
supply on Saturday.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Drugstores are monitored periodically by the
police. However, these reviews generally are confined to the
larger distributors of drugs. The Scotland Yard Drug Squad has
four detectives specifically assigned to inspecting drugstores.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Drugstores keep detailed records of both
incoming and outgoing drugs. I examined this procedure in Boots
Picadilly, the all-night drugstore in London's famed square.
Dangerous drugs are kept in a special locked cabinet. Each
prescription is double checked and, of course, recorded. One
pharmacist will make up the order and initial the package, which
is checked by a second pharmacist. This particular store served
36 addicts daily at the time of this review.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Retail prices are standardized. Heroin is a
bargain compared with the various forms of methadone. The 1970
retail prices were as follows:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">Heroin 100 tablets (10 mg. each) 1000 mg.
$2.16</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">Methadone 100 ampoules (10 mg. each) 1000 mg.
7.50</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">Methadone linctus (syrup) 5 bottles (200 mg.
each) 1000 mg. 7.80</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Since addicts come under National Health
Service coverage, the drugs are free except for a small-25
cents-weekly service charge. Disposable needles and syringes are
provided directly to addicts by some clinics or are supplied by
the drugstore.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">I was able to locate only two clinics in
England that provide drugs administered directly by the staff.
These are in Southampton and Portsmouth. I visited the Portsmouth
clinic, directed by Dr. Ian Christie, in St. James Hospital.
Because of the small number of patients, significant conclusions
cannot be drawn from the in-clinic, drug-administering approach
at this hospital. Seven addicts, six receiving methadone and one
heroin, come to the clinic twice a day for their injections.
These are given by hospital nurses in early-morning and
late-afternoon sessions in the hospital's dental department.
Injections are given in the deltoid muscle. The methadone addicts
I interviewed said that they do not get a &quot;flash&quot; from
the methadone intramuscular injection as they did from heroin
when they administered it intravenously themselves in preclinic
days.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Although all addicts mentioned the
inconvenience of coming twice a day to the hospital-which is not
centrally located-only one complained vociferously about it. He
said he had to take a cab from work daily in order not to miss
his second injection, at the 5:15 afternoon clinic. His employer
was unaware of his addiction and, he said, probably would fire
him if he found out.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In addition to the twice-daily clinic
patients, Dr. Christie has four others receiving methadone
linctus which he provides via prescription and two heroin
addicts-a husband and wife with a long history of addiction-who
also receive prescriptions and administer the drug themselves.
&quot;This probably was a mistake,&quot; Christie said.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">None of those receiving any drug is provided
with any rehabilitation services. &quot;if they chose drugs, they
get drugs,&quot; Dr. Christie said.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">He gives each addict alternatives: hospital
in-patient withdrawal (&quot;Everyone who has tried that method
has relapsed&quot;); in-hospital assessment with subsequent
in-clinic daily drug taking; and, finally, entry into a
therapeutic community, called the Alpha Unit.<br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <center><font size="1">PRESCRIPTION TRENDS <br>
</font></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Since the clinics began operating in 1968, the
quantity of heroin used by English addicts has been greatly
reduced. In the clinics, the monthly total grams of heroin have
dropped from 2,177 in January, 1969, to 1,131 in December, 1970
(see Table 7-4).</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Furthermore, while in 1968 the vast majority
of English addicts were taking heroin, today the majority are
taking methadone alone or in combination with heroin. Whatever
the opiate, the daily amount each addict takes is generally
significantly less than the preclinic daily quantity.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Statistics show that only 10 per cent, or 140,
of all known addicts receiving opiates were receiving heroin
alone on December 31, 1970. However, this may be somewhat
misleading, not only because the reporting procedure may be less
than perfect, but because prescribing physicians frequently
change both the quantity and the kind of drug prescribed.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">It is important to remember that methadone in
England most frequently is provided for intravenous injection (as
is heroin), and not for oral consumption, as is common in the
United States. More than twice as much methadone is prescribed
for injection as orally. Most important, injected methadone has a
good &quot;rush&quot; -oral methadone does not.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Most clinics have adopted the policy of moving
from heroin to methadone. Often, this is done gradually by giving
a combination of heroin and methadone for a certain period and
then shifting to methadone only. Finally, an attempt is made to
shift to oral or linctus methadone. Psychiatrists agree that the
hardest task beyond total drug abstention-is to convince the
addict to give up the needle.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">This prescribing trend is reflected in the
individual clinics. Here are some samples:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Larnbeth-8 on heroin alone, 12 on methadone
and heroin, 76 on methadone alone</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">St. Clement-36 on methadone and heroin, 35 on
methadone</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">St. Giles-54 on heroin or methadone and
heroin, 1 1 on methadone for injection, 10 on methadone oral</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Charing Cross-2 on heroin, 10 on methadone and
heroin, 45 on methadone for injection, 33 on methadone oral</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Portsmouth-3 on heroin only, 6 on methadone
for injection, 4 on methadone oral</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The shift from heroin to methadone is further
indicated by the fact that clinics today infrequently interview a
new heroin addict. The head nurse of the largest London clinic,
Charing Cross, could not recall the last time a new heroin addict
had been interviewed; all the new cases were methadone addicts.
In Portsmouth, Dr. Christie said, no one addicted to heroin had
applied for help in the previous year; all the newcomers were
methadone addicts.<br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <center><font size="1">METHADONE MAINTENANCE <br>
</font></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Directors of government clinics do not
practice the Dole Nyswander methadone-maintenance technique,
emphasizing blocking the effect of heroin. Significantly, four
clinic directors expressed doubts about the effectiveness of the
blocking method. Dr. Christie, for example, believes that
methadone blocks heroin in American addicts because they are
accustomed to receive low and diluted doses of the latter drug.
&quot;When an addict takes only four or five $5 bags a day, which
don't contain more than 20 milligrams of heroin, then it
works.&quot; The others agreed that an addict who takes large
doses of heroin daily cannot be blocked with methadone.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">However, a private London clinic, run by Dr.
Peter A. L. Chapple, has experimented with the
methadone-maintenance approach known in the United States. This
is the National Addiction and Research Institute, which has at
least as many active patients as the biggest government clinic.
Dr. Chapple prescribes only oral methadone. He is not licensed to
prescribe heroin in his clinic, and he is opposed to prescribing
methadone for injection because it perpetuates the needle cult.
In 1969, he prescribed oral methadone to 106 patients, 70 per
cent of whom were receiving blocking dosages (between 100 and 200
milligrams a day). There are no scientific data available
indicating whether these addicts actually were blocked from the
effect of heroin. Recently, however, Dr. Chapple said that he has
been trying to</font><font size="1"> reduce the dosages of oral
methadone. &quot;It probably was a mistake to go as high as 200
milligrams a day,&quot; he added. The maximum is now 100
milligrams a day, while younger addicts are more likely to be
around the 30-milligram-per-day level. Dr. Chapple said he has
shifted from giving a blocking dose because there is less heroin
around. He said he wanted to satisfy the drug hunger and not
necessarily to block heroin.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">*Interclinic statistics kept only since
September, 1969. <b>SOURCE: </b>Department of Health and Social
Security.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">He acknowledged that it is very difficult to
work with younger </font><font size="2">addicts using oral
methadone, largely because of their delinquent and erratic
behavior. Last year, a young addict died as a result of taking
barbiturates while also taking oral methadone. (Dr. Connell, in
his examination of 107 addicts at a government clinic, also
recorded an oral-methadone overdose death. This involved an
addict on 100 milligrams a day who obtained the next day's supply
shortly after midnight and drank both within hours of each
other.)</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">If England's drug doctors do not subscribe to
methadone maintenance, why have they shifted so dramatically to
methadone from heroin?</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">First, the very creation of the clinic
approach was prompted by what England viewed <i>as </i>a growing
heroin epidemic. There was public and political pressure to halt
the rise in heroin addicts. The monthly distribution of a dossier
showing the amounts of heroin prescribed by each clinic made it
clear to each clinic director where he stood among his peers in
this respect and undoubtedly created pressure to bring the
quantity down.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Secondly, there is general agreement among
clinic physicians that methadone has a longer-lasting effect than
heroin. Thus, the addict needs fewer injections a day.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Thirdly, methadone for injection is considered
somewhat more sterile than heroin, since it comes in liqui4 form,
so that the addict merely transfers the ampoule content directly
into his syringe. With heroin, he mixes a 10-milligram pill with
water, usually unsterile and sometimes from a tap or even a
toilet bowl, to dissolve the pill before injecting.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Finally, methadone for injection is viewed by
a number of doctors as the bridge to oral methadone. Breaking the
needle cult is considered an important success step in the
drug-treatment program in England.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Unfortunately, addict performances on heroin,
methadone for injection, and oral methadone have received no
detailed scientific comparison in England.
Furthermore-surprisingly, to an outsider-methadone continues to
be available outside of the drug clinics. There is nothing to
prevent general practitioners from prescribing it. A few, in
fact, do. (Scotland Yard Drug Squad detectives, who monitor
drugstores, say that about six London doctors prescribe methadone
on a regular basis.) Ironically, the second Brain Committee
foresaw the possibility that a substitute drug might become
potentially as dangerous as heroin. When the committee urged and
achieved prescribing restrictions on heroin, it said: &quot;If,
in future, circumstances should change, and other drugs of
addiction should take the place now occupied by heroin and
cocaine, it would be necessary promptly to amend the 'restricted'
list accordingly.&quot; A number of leading professionals have
urged that methadone be placed on the &quot;restricted&quot;
list, but this has not been done.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The clinic shift from heroin to methadone,
plus the absence of prescribing prohibitions on general
practitioners, undoubtedly had led to a new metbadone-addiction
problem. The key issue is how big a problem it is. The over-all
clinic drug-dispensing statistics indicate strongly that
considerably lower quantities of combined heroin and methadone
are being prescribed today than the largely heroin-only
prescriptions at the beginning of the clinic era, but exactly how
much lower is impossible to show, since methadone statistics were
not reported until September, 1969.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">However, it appears that there has not been a
simple switch from a heroin to a methadone problem. Doctors
interviewed are concerned about rising methadone cases but do not
suggest that they are replacing heroin cases on a one-for-one
basis. That is, the methadone increase is moving at a
considerably slower pace than the sharp drop in heroin addiction,
although no one can document the relative rates of change.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">The police, however, are less inclined to make
distinctions. In a 1970 report, Scotland Yard said:</font> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>There has been a transference of addiction in as much as
    the treatment centers have succeeded in reducing the amount
    of heroin prescribed to addicts, thereby reducing the
    availability of this drug on the &quot;illicit market.&quot;
    But, in so doing, they have increased the prescribing of
    methadone to counterbalance this reduction; consequently,
    there is now far more methadone available on the
    &quot;illicit market.&quot; <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p> <center><font size="1">DRUGS OUTSIDE THE CLINICS<br>
</font></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">How many other drugs do addicts take to
supplement those prescribed by the clinics?</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">While evidence in this area is both
fragmentary and sometimes disputed, there is agreement that
English addicts often supplement the clinic-prescribed drug diet,
with a wide assortment of chemicals that affect both the mind and
the body. These include black-market methadone or heroin,
amphetamines, barbiturates, tranquilizers, and marijuana, or, for
that matter, a smattering of all of them. In short, the addict in
England more often than not is a polydrug taker.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The most significant evidence comes from a
wide-ranging study conducted by two staff members of the
Addiction Research Institute. Between March and November, 1969,
they interviewed in depth I I I heroin users attending the London
clinics, representing about 10 per cent of all clinic patients in
England.' The results showed that only a small proportion of
English addicts can be considered &quot;stable&quot; in their
drug-taking habits.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Several clinic directors expressed
reservations about the study, claiming that it did not represent
a true cross-section of their population since it included only
active heroin addicts. At the time of the interviews, they said,
many of their patients, particularly the more promising ones, had
already been weaned off heroin and onto methadone only. The
study, however, did include 91 (of the 111) who were receiving
heroin in combination with methadone.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Eighty-four per cent reported to interviewers
that in the month prior to the interview they had used drugs
other than those prescribed for them by the clinics. Among these
other drugs, the largest number reported using barbiturates and
tranquilizers (75 per cent), which, in the majority of cases,
were prescribed by private physicians. This is an important
indication that extracurricular drug taking did not necessarily
mean adding larger doses of illegally obtained narcotics.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The range of drugs used is demonstrated in
Table 7-5. These statistics show that the one additional drug all
1 1 1 heroin addicts had used was marijuana or hashish <i>(cannabis).</i></font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">An interesting sidelight brought out during
the interviews was that 37 per cent had on occasion sold, lent,
or exchanged at least some of the drugs the clinics prescribed
for them. In addition, the study confirmed the worst fears of
physicians about the </font><font size="1">unsterile procedures
that are an important risk when addicts administer drugs to
themselves. The report speaks best for itself: </font> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>All subjects were using heroin by injection. In the week
    prior to interview 28 (25%) subjects had injected themselves
    at home only, a further 17 (15%) had injected themselves at
    their clinic or at a day center as well as at their home, 46
    (41 %) had injected themselves at some time during the week
    in a public toilet as well as at home, clinic, or day center,
    and 20 (18%) had injected themselves in a &quot;public
    place&quot;-e.g., shop doorways, in the street ' or in
    telephone kiosks-in addition to any of the above places.
    Sixty-two (56%) had injected themselves whilst other addicts
    were present and also injecting themselves. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The majority of subjects ( 101, 91 %) used a disposable
    syringe for their injections and of these 67 (66%) regularly
    used their syringes more than once. Seventy-two subjects
    (68%) did not clean their arms prior to injection. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Although the most frequent method for preparing an
    injection was to dissolve heroin in sterile water, 54 (49%)
    had at some time during the week used ordinary unboiled tap
    water, and 12 (11%) had used water from a lavatory basin.
    Nine subjects reported sharing a syringe with another addict
    during the week.<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p> <img src="img00031.gif"> </p>

<p> <font size="1">If injection practices are defined as sterile
when normal medical </font><font size="2">procedure is followed
(i.e., using a new disposable syringe for each injection or using
an adequately sterilized glass syringe, not sharing a syringe,
cleaning the arm prior to injection, and making up the injection
with sterile water) then in the total sample, 12 subjects (11%)
are using sterile injection practices. In the week prior to
interview all others had engaged in some non-sterile practice. </font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">This kind of unsterile drug taking often led
to medical complications. Thirty-nine per cent had been in
hospitals for treatment of septicaernia, hepatitis, abscesses, or
overdose. Of all addicts interviewed, 40 per cent reported
hepatitis and overdose and 46 per cent reported abscesses treated
both in and outside of hospitals.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Although this report indicated no particular
trend in polydrug taking, since the clinics began doctors have
seen definite increases in two drugs: methylamphetamine (speed)
and barbiturates. In 1968, methylamphetamine was injected by
addicts with such frequency that authorities asked its
manufacturers to agree to withdraw it from the retail market and
restrict its distribution to hospital pharmacies. Within weeks of
its disappearance from retail drugstores it disappeared among the
addict population.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Misuse of barbiturates. by addicts became an
acute problem in 1969. Some physicians, however, feel that it has
slowed somewhat since the last part of 1970. Addicts inject
barbiturates even though they are not manufactured, so that they
will dissolve completely in water. The undissolved particles
result in collapsed veins and serious abscesses on addicts' arms
and legs. Addicts I've interviewed said that they resorted to
barbiturates when they couldn't get enough heroin or methadone
from the clinics. This, like all addict testimonials, is open to
question.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The degree of barbiturate abuse-particularly
by injection-is another aspect of the English drug scene that is
left largely to conjecture. A study in 1969 of a small sample of
heroin addicts -again conducted by a team from the Addiction
Research Unit-showed that among this sample the problem was
huge.' Sixty-five heroin addicts were interviewed in May, June,
and July of 1969, and 80 per cent were found to have injected
barbiturates. Almost all of them-62 of the 65-had taken
barbiturates either by injection or orally. Of course, some had
used the drug only to help induce sleep. However, 65 per cent
acknowledged they had taken it for no medical reason and only for
&quot;kicks.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">A few addicts will take barbiturates with them
to the clinics, although they may have obtained them from a
general practitioner or bought them illicitly. I observed an
especially bizarre scene in one of the clinics.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">There were two chairs in the room, a steel
sink, a length of rubber hose to use as a tourniquet, some
cotton, and a supply of paper towels. The walls and the chairs
were stained with dried blood; in general, the physical
appearance of the room was far from the kind of antiseptic clinic
presented by the likes of Drs. Kildare and Ben Casey. The
characters on this stage were two young addicts, both unsteady on
their feet from drugs taken earlier. One took a syringe from his
pocket, washed it out with tap water from the sink, pulled a
folded piece of paper from another pocket, removed a barbiturate
capsule, broke it in half over the syringe, and emptied its
contents into the tube.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Once the white powder was in the syringe, he
added tap water, shook the contents vigorously for several
seconds, and handed the syringe to his friend. Since his arms and
ankles were marked with sores, however, it took several minutes
to locate a usable vein. Finally, he settled on a spot about
eight inches below the knee. (The other addict, incidentally,
shortly afterwards injected himself in the sole of his foot.)</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">A third addict, more stable, helped the first
boy out of the clinic by steadying him with an arm around his
shoulders. But once outside the clinic, the boy sagged and
collapsed on the grass. A few addicts nearby helped to drag the
boy out of the sun to a tree, where they sat him up against its
trunk.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">I was not alone in observing this sequence; a
clinic psychiatrist watched the entire scene with me. No effort
was made to assist, dissuade, or reprimand the addicts. We were
both spectators, like a couple of medical students watching
surgical techniques from behind a glass partition. <br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <center><i><font size="2">LAW ENFORCEMENT <br>
</font></i></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Although the English have consistently viewed
drug addiction as a medical problem, this does not mean that the
police have been dismissed from the drug scene. Possession,
selling, and importing most dangerous drugs are against the law.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">An addict can go to a government clinic and,
after convincing doctors of his addiction, obtain free heroin,
but this does not mean that anyone can walk around London with a
pocketful of &quot;horse&quot; or any other opiate. Possession of
heroin, methadone, and similar dangerous drugs is illegal without
a prescription. In the case of heroin, the only source of such a
prescription is a government clinic.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Marijuana and hashish are illegal, period.
There are no prescriptions given for these drugs and no medical
&quot;cover&quot; exists to protect the owner of them. In
England, they are clearly the number-one illegal drug, and their
use continues to rise along with the arrest statistics of those
who are caught with them. From 1968 to 1970, the number of <i>cannabis
</i>offenses more than doubled from 3,071 to 7,520. In 1970, <i>cannibis
</i>seizures amounted to </font><font size="1">11/4 </font><font
size="2">tons.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Unlike the United States, Britain has no
national police agency for drugs. For that matter, if there is no
equivalent to the U.S. Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs,
neither is there one for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Scotland Yard is essentially a London agency, and, when a
Scotland Yard man is found looking for clues on some fog-shrouded
English moor (usually in a paperback detective thriller), he is
there on loan from London. In short, there is no national police
force.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Drug squads have been created largely because
of need or, sometimes, because of the personal interest of an
individual police officer. These squads have no nationwide
resources available to them either from an enforcement or from a
training point of view. Drug-squad members, including the
higher-echelon officers in charge of them, are largely
self-educated about drugs. Even Scotland Yard's Drug Squad is
likely to have a director today who next month or next year may
be shifted to a completely different area of police work.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">However, this does not mean that expertise has
not built up. There is no better example of expertise constructed
largely out of self-developed personal interest than Detective
Sergeant Alan Russell, who heads the drug squad in Portsmouth. If
a national police drug force ever should be established, as some
are urging, Sergeant Russell should have a prominent role in it
on the basis of his record in Portsmouth.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Russell has an excellent, and unpublicized,
working relationship with Dr. Christie of the Portsmouth drug
clinic: Christie doesn't squeal on addicts and Russell doesn't
give away police plans, but it is clear from the way the two men
speak of each other that each has developed a warm respect for
the other's approach to addiction. The addicts appear to respect
Russell as well. When the residents of Alpha Unit, the
therapeutic community directed by Dr. Christie, decided to hold
an open house, they invited Russell even though he had arrested a
number of them on past occasions.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Because of the Christie-Russell liaison-and
addicts corroborate it-there is virtually no black market in
heroin or methadone in the Portsmouth area. In 1969, Russell's
squad arrested two persons for possessing heroin, and this
involved only minute traces found in a syringe. During the entire
year, there were 12 to 15 methadone-possession arrests.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Russell, however, regards opiate addiction as
only a small part of his concern. &quot;Dependence on opiate
drugs is only the tip of the iceberg,&quot; he says. &quot;You
have millions of people in this country who are dependent on
barbiturates and amphetamines.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In the greater Portsmouth area, with a
population of about 500,000, he estimates that there are as many
as 1,500 users of marijuana, barbiturates, and amphetamines, some
of whom may dabble with all of these drugs. This estimate is in
marked contrast to the very low numbers of hard-drug addicts-14
in the clinic and 17 in the Alpha Unit therapeutic community.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Possibly in part because of his respect for
Dr. Christie, Portsmouth's chief drug police officer has a very
positive attitude toward the clinics. &quot;Make no mistake about
it-and some people tend to forget it-a few years ago this country
had a serious heroin problem.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In London, there is considerable criticism of
the clinics among members of Scotland Yard's Drug Squad, although
not a single police officer whom I interviewed was willing to
scrap the clinics. Several officers thought that some clinic
doctors were still being conned by addicts into issuing larger
prescriptions than required. However, all the officers agreed
that overprescribing had been reduced drastically since preclinic
days.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">As an example that the problem has not been
eliminated entirely, they cite a case in 1969: A member of the
squad searched the apartment of a longtime addict who had been
receiving drugs from one of the central London clinics before his
death. The search uncovered a horde of heroin-900 tablets or
9,000 milligrams, worth more than $2,100 on the British black
market and easily three times as much on the U.S. market.
Although there was no evidence that the addict had been selling
from this cache, the police felt strongly that it corroborated
their overprescribing charge.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Furthermore, police are annoyed that there is
no limit on the amount an addict with a clinic prescription may
carry. Recently, they stopped an addict with 40 grains (2,400
milligrams) of heroin. He told officers he had been reducing his
prescribed quantity, and no arrest was possible, even though the
police strongly doubted his story.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Yet, such dramatic anecdotes are the
exception. A review of squad arrest records shows that, from the
beginning of June to September 7, 1970 (the date of the
interview), there hadn't been a single heroin arrest and only two
methadone-possession arrests. (These were not the only London
drug arrests; for, although the squad is the only police unit
concerned solely with drugs, other London policemen make drug
arrests in the course of their regular activities.)</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Some members of the drug squad frankly admit
that they would be in trouble if heroin were completely outlawed.
None is campaigning for such a move. One top drug-squad officer,
a critic of the present clinic approach (&quot;They sustain
addiction . . . there is no place in England where a drug addict
can be cured&quot;) is not interested in abolishing them, either.
He would like to see all drugs administered by the clinics in the
clinics. Instead of fourteen separate clinics in London, he would
like four open on a twenty-four-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week
basis.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Scotland Yard detectives acknowledge that the
clinics have reduced not only the quantity of heroin prescribed
but the amount available on the black market. Cocaine, they say,
has also been reduced dramatically. Like their colleagues in
Portsmouth, however, they are often more concerned about the
other drugs that are available on the black market.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The lead drug, of course, is marijuana. They
claim that large scale trafficking is mainly carried on by
England's new immigrant population, primarily the Pakistanis.
Marijuana comes into England frequently by parcel post directly
from the producing countries. Students also bring it in from such
well-known drug centers as Morocco.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">LSD most often comes from the United States,
even though in<b> </b>1969 English police raided and closed down
at least two illicit laboratories producing LSD for both local
consumption and export.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">There appears to be little organized
importation of heroin. What there is generally comes from Hong
Kong and is imported by Chinese sailors and distributed by
inhabitants of the small Chinese community in London. Addicts
generally are not fond of Chinese heroin because of its uncertain
strength and, since it comes in powder form, the necessity to
heat it in a spoon-in the U.S. mode-before mixing it for
injection.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Police acknowledge that one can buy a variety
of illicit drugs in the network of side streets in and around
Picadilly Circus and in some other areas of London where youth
congregate, often in or around the late-night clubs. However,
these illicit business enterprises are small and unorganized,
particularly in the hard drug line.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Black-market prices in 1970, according to the
addicts and confirmed by clinic physicians and police, are as
follows: </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Heroin (British-manufactured) $14.40 a grain
(60 mg.)</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Heroin (Chinese) $3.60 a packet (30-60 mg.)</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Methadone $7.20-$12.80 a grain (60 mg.)</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Barbiturates 25 cents a capsule <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">There is no evidence anywhere that large
numbers of hard-drug users are supplying themselves from this
black market. Furthermore, there is no evidence at all that
heroin manufactured in France-the principal source of supply for
U.S. addicts-is being smuggled into England. The market just
isn't big enough to make such an enterprise profitable.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Scotland Yard does keep track of international
and particularly European illicit-drug activity. Its principal
source for this information is not Interpol but the European
office of the U.S. Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. The
drug-squad detectives express a great deal of respect for their
American colleagues and are quick to admit that, if they need
information or have a common problem, they will call Paris rather
than Interpol. Often, they say, an American narcotics agent will
arrive on the next plane.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In 1970, the BNDD for the first time assigned
a permanent man to the embassy in London, as part of its over-all
European expansion of manpower. A London slot was created because
of the LSD traffic from the United States to England and the
marijuana and hashish flow from England to the United States.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">John T. Cusack, the BNDD's European regional
director, is not enthusiastic about the English clinic approach.
Of all police officers interviewed, he was the most strongly
negative about the clinic program. &quot;The<b> </b>clinics are
not going to work giving away heroin. They are going to sustain
and create some addicts,&quot; he said.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">He had three principal objections: &quot; [I]
It fools society. It kids all of us that it's<b> </b>doing a job
when it isn't doing a job. [21 The addicts will take what they
can get from the clinics and then they will get some more from
the outside. [31 The clinics flirt with a conflict of the
Hypocratic oath of the medical profession. They sustain a
medical-psychiatric sickness.&quot; (This argument is also made
by some British physicians, like Dr. Ian James, a British prison
psychiatrist.)</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Cusack, however, is not a
throw-them-all-in-jail police officer. He wants medical treatment
for addicts and believes that governments don't<b> </b>spend
anywhere near what they should on hospital care for addicts.
&quot;I feel so strongly about it that I'd like to sweep up all
the addicts off the New York streets and put them into hospitals.
It's incredible to me to leave addicts on the street. It's<b> </b>a
big, expensive job to bring them in, but we don't let our mental
patients run loose, do we?&quot; <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">If Cusack strongly disagrees with the English
clinic philosophy, his London police colleagues sharply differ
with their American counterparts over one vital aspect of the
drug problem: the connection between crime and addiction. <i>No
one in England-from the toughest London detective to the most
liberal-prescribing clinic physician-suggested to me that
narcotics addiction increases criminal behavior. </i>This does
not mean, of course, that drug addicts are crime-free. On the
contrary, a significant number of addicts engage in criminal
behavior, and some criminals are addicts. But in England there is
no cause-and-effect relationship.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Scotland Yard says it in writing. In a 1970
report, its drug expert wrote: &quot;There is no concrete
evidence to connect any particular criminal activity with those
dependent on the 'hard' drugs (e.g., heroin) but without doubt,
the increasing demand for the amphetamine-type drugs leads to
thefts from chemists' premises, hospitals, and, in a smaller
degree, to thefts of prescription forms.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Study after study documents the fact that
sticking a needle into his arm doesn't propel a man into the
robber and burglar fraternity. More likely, he will have been
initiated long before. What these studies do show is that addicts
often have a whole series of antisocial &quot;hang-ups,&quot; of
which addiction is just one more on the lengthy list.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In the previously cited 1970 study of 111
heroin addicts attending London clinics, 51 per cent reported a
conviction for a nondrug offense <i>before </i>their first use of
heroin. Thirty-six per cent reported such a conviction since
using heroin.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">A 1967 study of 50 addict-criminals in London
prisons again indicates that a track record in court and prison
often is established before track marks on the subject's arms.'
Brixton Prison psychiatrist Ian James found that 22 addicts had a
history of juvenile-court conviction and 16 had adult-court
convictions prior to heroin addiction. In all, &quot;Three
quarters had a history of court convictions <i>predating </i>their
addiction to narcotics, and there was usually a story of personal
and social maladjustment dating from adolescence (educational
dropout, employment instability, sociopathic conduct,
etc.).&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Ten of the subjects had been convicted only
since they became addicted, but only two were in prison for their
very first conviction. Dr. James found, too, that, if one
discounts drug convictions, fewer convictions for crimes were
recorded <i>after </i>addiction than before.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Although it is risky to draw conclusions about
United States addicts based on English findings, one young
American doctor did suggest that what was true about preaddiction
delinquency in Britain may be even more valid in the United
States. Dr. Michael Paris, formerly on the staff of the Federal
Hospital for Addict Rehabilitation at Lexington, Kentucky, worked
with Dr. Bewley in 1970 in his London clinics. Asked to compare
U.S. and British addicts, he said that the Americans he saw at
Lexington had bad at least twice as much antisocial behavior in
their early teens as the London addicts.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In the first study of heroin users in a
provincial town, investigators found a reduction rather than an
increase in crime after addiction began. Twenty of 37 heroin
users had been convicted of breaking the law.&quot; </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The crimes not involving drugs were generally
petty in nature, such as stealing two pints of milk, minor
shopliftng, and taking and driving away a motor vehicle. Of the
ten people who had been convicted of nondrug offenses, three had
committed them before using any drugs at all, and seven between
first trying drugs and first trying heroin. There was only one
person who was convicted of a nondrug offense after heroin use
began, and this person had already been convicted of such a crime
before the onset of heroin use. </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">These findings prompted investigators to
suggest further research:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Many of our subjects were in full-time
employment or were full-time students; most were still living at
home with their parents, a high proportion of whom knew of their
heroin use. Although there were instances of nondrug crime before
heroin use began, there was only one such conviction (a second
offense) afterwards. Whether drug use is for some people an
&quot;alternative&quot; to other types of delinquent behavior is
a question which suggests itself for investigation and remains
open, but it is clear that our sample in no way constitutes a
drifting criminal subculture, <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <center><i><font size="2">RESEARCH<br>
</font></i></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Until 1967, research in drug addiction in
England depended on the personal interest of a physician. A
handful of doctors wrote papers based on their personal
experiences with addicts. Public awareness of the problem still
was slight, and concern and knowledge among doctors in general
were not much greater. Funds for research simply were not
available.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Today, the veterans of the predrug-crisis era
continue to produce papers for both national and international
medical publications, but they have been joined not only by
individual newcomers but by a government-supported research
project as well.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The Addiction Research Unit is a kind of
scientific conglomerate that investigates three of man's<b> </b>major
vices-drinking, smoking, and drug addiction. The unit, a part of
the Department of Psychiatry of London University's Institute of
Psychiatry, began in 1964 as an alcoholism research group. In
1967, after the Brain Committee report was translated into
legislation and public concern heightened with the catapulting
addiction statistics, political pressure prompted the Health
Department to provide funds for drug-addiction research. Drug
investigations were added to the unit's agenda, and sufficient
funds were supplied to construct a separate building on the
grounds of Maudsley Hospital. Research on smoking was added in
1969.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Each area of investigation has a separate
staff and coordinator, with the largest number in the
drug-addiction field. Dr. Griffith Edwards, whose earlier
interest was in alcoholism, is director of the entire unit, and
Dr. David V. Hawks, a psychologist, is coordinator of the
eleven-man (and woman) Drug Research Group.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Another organization, the Institute for the
Study of Drug Dependence, a privately financed group, does no
clinical research, although it is looking for funds to finance
both clinical and other investigations. The Institute, with Sir
Harry Greenfield as board chairman, is directed by a retired
foreign-service officer with a personal interest in addiction. In
the two years since it began, this struggling enterprise-financed
by small foundation grants-has carved out a useful function as an
information clearinghouse. It is the one place in England where a
researcher can find extensive, indexed, and easily available
material on the English drug scene as well as numerous items
involving other countries.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Until now, the national Department of Health
has done no specific drug-addiction research of its own. In 1970,
a joint committee of the Health Department and the Home Office
was created primarily to try to straighten out the sometimes
confused drug statistics. It recommended establishment of a Drugs
Research Group to be staffed by both agencies. While no specific
research program was proposed, the committee suggested the
following areas of investigation:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">1. Developing a typology of heroin users.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">2. Measuring the effectiveness of different
forms of treatment in the existing clinics.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">3. Comparing the effectiveness of compulsory
treatment (in prison) with voluntary treatment in hospitals.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">More important, perhaps, was the committee's
recommendation that statistical information be compiled on all
persons addicted to <i>any </i>dangerous drug in England and
Wales. The Department of Health is now building such a data bank,
which already includes a total of 2,400 names, with the basic
information obtained when an addict applies to a clinic or is
hospitalized. Other government statistical records to be tapped
include:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">1. Dates and causes of death from the General
Register office.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">2. Admissions and length of stay in
psychiatric hospitals from the Department of Health and Social
Security records. </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">3. Details of employment histories, sickness
and unemployment payments from the Department of Health and
Social Security's Mental Health Inquiry Records.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">4. Criminal records and prison statistics from
the Home Office Statistical Division.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">This will be a vital resource for
investigators and will open numerous research opportunities into
drug addiction in England.<br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <center><i><font size="2">THE STATISTICS <br>
</font></i></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">How accurate are the drug statistics in
England today?</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">It is difficult to generalize. Some statistics
are clearly more solid than others. A number of persons
interviewed expressed skepticism about the validity of one or
more sets of statistics. Included among the skeptics was a
Department of Health official who works with the drug numbers.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">The problem with the statistics is that
reporting depends on individual physicians and clinic personnel
whose information is not channeled through a system of
cross-checks. The new Health Department data bank should help to
improve the accuracy of some of these statistics.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Among the numerical data available, the clinic
figures reporting quantities of drugs prescribed appear to be
least open to significant error. Apart from an occasional
bookkeeping mistake, these statistics should accurately reflect
the downward trend of heroin use and the rise in methadone.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">The monthly clinic-attendance figures should
stand up. However, the number of new addicts that clinics report
every month may be a somewhat soft statistical area, because
clinics may vary in their definition of a new addict.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The clinic figures for the percentage of
addicts employed could be on the high side, since
&quot;employment&quot; depends on the individual's definition,
and the accuracy of the addict's statements is questionable. The
data bank, which will include employment records based on
social-security information, should provide a cross-check for
these claims.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The vital Home Office figures on addicts have
to be separated into addicts reported any time during the year
and addicts known to be receiving drugs at the end of the year.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">The figures for the total year tend to be
accepted as reasonably correct by those interviewed, with the
general acknowledgment that obviously not every addict in England
is known to the Home Office. However, no one suggested that the
number of &quot;unknowns&quot; is as large as the numbers listed.
Opiate addiction, under the English drug approach, is difficult
to conceal if it is taking place on any significant scale. The
highest estimate for unreported opiate use was 25 per cent, but
this guesstimate included occasional users as well as addicts.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">The Home Office figures for 1968 may be
unusually high because inauguration of the clinics may well have
flushed out previously unknown addicts. As a result, the tiny
increase in the total 1969 figures may not accurately reflect the
degree of change. Not until the end of 1970 did England have a
firm statistical basis for concluding that the narcotic-addiction
spiral of the 1960's had been halted.<br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <center><i><font size="2">RESULTS<br>
</font></i></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">There is a shortage of hard statistical data
about the success or failure of Britain's drug approach, either
before or after the clinic program was begun. Most available
evaluations were done prior to the inauguration of the clinic
program. These do not generate applause.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">For example, in 1968, a study of 1,271 heroin
addicts who became known to the Home Office between 1947 and 1966
showed that 70 per cent were still taking opiates in 1966.&quot;
Of the nontakers, some 293 addicts-64 per cent-were in prison,
hospital, or other institutions, and 89 were dead, the majority
as a result of overdose, suicide, or sepsis.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The death rate among English addicts has been
very high according to the Bewley study, twice as high as among
U.S. addicts. However, this study was conducted prior to the
clinic program, when British addicts were receiving huge amounts
of heroin prescribed by general practitioners. The death rate
among addicts included in this review was 28 times greater than
the rate for the equivalent age group in the general population.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Studies of withdrawal treatment in hospitals
are not more encouraging. In one follow-up of 23 hospital
admissions, 12 relapsed within a week, five within a month, and
three within two months. Only three were still avoiding narcotics
three months after discharge.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Like their American brethren, the English
today have no file folder marked &quot;cures&quot;; there is no
computer printout on clinic performance that supports either the
critics or the defenders of the program.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">There is, however, a cautious thread of
optimism that runs through conversations with clinic directors
and also a surprising degree of candor in identifying areas of
shortcoming and outright failure. Furthermore, these subjective
evaluations by different directors generally make nearly
identical points of both promise and disappointment. Finally,
they are echoed by those who have no particular vested interest
in the clinics.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Dr. Margaret Tripp, a doctor at St. Clement
with no previous experience with drug addicts, frankly admits
that her charges conned her in the beginning. Two years later she
said: <b>&quot;I </b>think we are controlling legal heroin. Much
to my surprise, we have stabilized the addicts-they're not dead,
and they are better. They are more stable than before; their drug
use has gone down, they work longer, and they are less of a
nuisance to everybody.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Dr. Tripp chooses her words very carefully:
&quot;Three or four of the [present] cases are reasonably off
drugs.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Dr. Willis, at St. Giles, also avoids words
like &quot;success&quot; and &quot;cure.&quot; He also cites the
drop in heroin and agrees that the rise of addiction has slowed.
&quot;It's been possible to mount a general tidying-up operation.
They are more stable now than they were a year ago. Their general
appearance is better. They are not asking for more drugs, and
they are not claiming as much drug loss [in order to obtain
replacements] as they did before.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Dr. Connell, who is among the handful of
English drug-treatment veterans, a consultant to the national
Health Department and director of the Maudsley Hospital drug
clinic, summed it up this way:</font> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I'm pleased that the frightening curve of heroin addiction
    has leveled off. I'm disturbed that methadone and
    barbiturates have risen. In terms of containing the heroin
    problem, they [the clinics] are successful. They have
    provided some treatment services where none have existed. All
    of the terrible prognostications of American workers in the
    drug field have been unfounded. But [Dr. Connell added] in
    terms of research they are a failure. </p>
</blockquote>

<p> <font size="2">Similar sentiments are voiced by those who are
being asked to evaluate their own work. </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Even the most hardened policeman-as we noted
in the law enforcement section-is not prepared to suggest that
England should scrap the clinics. Despite the grumbling about
doctors who are either too softhearted-in the eyes of the
police-or simply conned by addicts, the interviewer is left with
the distinct impression that even law-enforcement officers
believe that the hard-drug picture has improved somewhat.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Among druggists, there also is cautious
optimism for the clinic approach. For example, Jerry Young, chief
chemist at Boots Picadilly, says flatly:</font> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I'm very pleased with the clinic system. I'd even be more
    pleased if they'd take the whole thing in their hands
    [administer drugs directly in the clinics]. We see more
    stability in the addicts. They don't come in making
    exorbitant demands on our service and our time. The genuine
    addicts are less of a nuisance. On the whole, they took
    physically better. They respond better.<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p> <font size="2">Asked for some tangible proof of his
assessment, Mr. Young said that, prior to the spring of 1968,
when the clinics began, he had to call the police on the average
of twice a week to control an unruly addict in his pharmacy. Now,
he said, he can't remember a recent call for police assistance
with a clinic addict. Occasionally, he asks police help with a
forged prescription or when someone under the influence of
barbiturates makes a disturbance.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Mr. Young's analysis, like those of the
physicians who send him prescriptions, is subjective. However,
there are at least a few statistical indications-developed since
the clinic program began -that tend to support these assumptions.
To find them, you have to go to an institution dealing with a
considerably larger clientele than drug addicts.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Brixton Prison, with its incongruous
flower-filled inner courtyard, is to London what the Tombs is to
New York. It is a remand prison, where all London-area male
prisoners are brought while awaiting trial. There are 12,000
&quot;receptions&quot; there annually.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Brixton, in 1970, had on its staff the one man
who may have seen more English drug addicts personally than any
other individual. Dr. Ian James, the prison psychiatrist, has a
long interest in drug addiction. His small prison office is lined
with maps showing the routes by which drugs come to England, the
location of addict arrests in London, the location of clinics,
the arrests of those who are off drugs-all appropriately marked
in clusters of multicolored pins.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In 1969, Dr. James saw 223 drug addicts who
were at Brixton for both drug and other offenses. They
represented about 10 per cent of all heroin addicts reported to
the Home Office during the year. Significantly, Dr. James said it
was rarely that he saw an addict unknown to the Home Office.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Dr. James in the past has been a vocal
opponent of the clinic program. His opposition was based largely
on medical ethics.</font> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Nobody prescribes two bottles of gin a day with duly
    enriched Vitamin B for alcoholics. The doctor knows that the
    addict will use an unsanitary procedure to satisfy his
    habits. He will take unsterile pills [heroin tablets], hold
    them in his sweaty hand, and put them in a syringe which he
    pulls from his grimy pocket. What kind of medicine is that? </p>
</blockquote>

<p> <font size="2">But Dr. James's own statistics are softening
his anticlinic stand to the point where he said: &quot;I think
the clinics are succeeding, but on the wrong premises.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Dr. James's accounting may not give
overwhelming proof to the statement that the clinics are having a
positive impact, but it does add some significant bone behind the
subjective flesh of cautious optimism.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In 1970, a third fewer drug addicts were
admitted to Brixton than during the previous year, Almost
three-fourths of all addicts received at Brixton in 1970 were
attending a drug-addiction clinic prior to their arrest. In 1968,
only three-fifths of the drug addicts were clinic-registered.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">These statistics not only buttress the
cautious optimism of English drug experts but also cast doubt on
any contention that there is a large addict population unknown to
the Home Office or to the clinics. If such an &quot;unknown&quot;
addict pool in fact existed, sustaining itself from the
high-priced black market, a significant number of its members
surely would appear periodically inside the steel gates of
Brixton. </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">There are other substantive indications that
the narcotics situation is improving. At three London centers,
the number of addicts holding jobs almost doubled in two years.
In these same clinics, a series of urine tests given a year apart
showed that, while many addicts still were taking more and
different drugs than those prescribed, such misuse had been
reduced.&quot; In yet another survey, there were fewer arrests a
year after addicts had been with a clinic than before.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">But what does all this mean for the United
States? What relevance does it have to America's ever-increasing
narcotics problem? In the past, almost all visiting American drug
experts have said flatly: None.&quot; The two countries, they
said, are just too different. Not only do some key narcotics laws
point in opposite directions, but the two societies' traditions,
youth culture, and race problems are so disparate that what works
in the row houses of London could not possibly work in the
walk-ups of New York.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">A young researcher at the Addiction Research
Unit may well have given an explosive jolt to such blanket
dismissals. Jim Zacune, a social psychologist, in 1970 examined
in detail the performance of Canadian addicts in their native
land and after they emigrated to England. His study is
significant to the U.S.-Britain narcotics-policy argument, since
Canada's approach to opiate addiction is largely patterned after
ours.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Zacune traced and interviewed 25 of the 91
Canadian addicts who are known to have come to England in the
1960's. The rest of the emigres could not be located or had
either died or been deported. For those he was able to interview,
Zacune compared work records, prison records, and crime records
in the two countries. He diplomatically says that his findings
should not be used to condemn one country's addiction approach
while praising another's, and cautions that his sample may have
included the most stable of the Canadians who packed up their
syringes for England. But his findings are nevertheless
startling: </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">At home, the Canadians spent 25 per cent of
their addicted years, a combined total of 141 years and 2 months,
in jail; in England, less than 2 per cent, a combined total of 2
years and 5 months.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">At home, they compiled 182 offenses; in
England, 27.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">At home, in the high addict-crime category of
theft, which included robbery and burglary, they committed 88; in
England, 8.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Not only did they commit far fewer crimes,
but, while in England, many of them were crime-free. In Canada,
16 of the 25 had committed five or more crimes, with one of them
recording more than 20 separate offenses. In Britain, none
committed more than four offenses and nearly half (12) were never
charged with any unlawful behavior.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Despite the fact that the Canadians consumed
far more daily heroin than the London average, many of them
became job holders and led fairly normal lives while in England.
Their living accommodations were far more stable. In Canada, only
five had a constant residence for more than three years; in
England, ten had lived at their present address for two or more
years, eight for one to two years, and five for less than one
year. Two were in the hospital at the time of the survey.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The employment record showed the most dramatic
difference between the two countries. In Canada, only one addict
claimed to have worked steadily while addicted. In England, the
majority (13) worked full-time, and four worked part-time. Six
had held the same job for at least three years. Seven had
semiskilled or skilled manual jobs, two were office workers, one
in sales, and one worked as a croupier. One was a full-time
housewife and one a student. &quot;For once we could work and
live like humans,&quot; the addicts said. The interviews
contained again and again this and other personal and pragmatic
assessments. &quot;There is less trouble from the police . . . we
don't constantly have to be paranoid . . . there is less pressure
. . . there is no need to steal.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">This study may encompass too small and special
a group of addicts to permit definitive conclusions. But,
together with the other fragmentary evidence, it suggests that
the English approach is an alternative not to be dismissed
summarily, as it is in a widely distributed U.S. Government
pamphlet, which claims that &quot;The British system is
considered a failure and has been modified to meet the increasing
problem of addiction.&quot;&quot; <br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <i><font size="2">PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS<br>
</font></i> </p>

<p> <font size="2">For the American visitor, the most pervasive
impression of the English drug scene comes in the form of a
question:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Why has the United States, decade after
decade, continuously viewed narcotics addiction as largely a
criminal, instead of a medical, problem?</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">With all its imperfections and
inconsistencies, the British approach to drug addiction convinced
me that the United States will never make significant headway
with the drug problem until it shifts the emphasis from the
criminal to the medical. Until this national policy is changed,
American addicts will continue to be an ostracized
subculture-morally exiled and often barred from the very medical
and social-work help they need so desperately, but physically
very much present in the criminal countdown of the larger
society, which has had to lock itself behind doors for the luxury
of guarding an unworkable dogma.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Until this national policy is changed, the
black market will continue to flourish no matter how many more
narcotics agents are enlisted, and daily will help to infect
others, because of the astronomical profits to be made.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Based on my research in England, I believe
that the United States should experiment with both a methadone-
and -a heroin maintenance program under more controlled and
restrictive conditions than generally prevail in Britain today.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">I believe that England provides significant
research opportunities about the effects of different opiates,
which could fill the knowledge void that is plaguing the
addiction field in so many countries. For example, what is the
precise difference between the effects of heroin and of injected
and oral methadone? What are the differences in work performance,
antisocial behavior, and life-styles among addicts who use heroin
and injectable and oral methadone? Because heroin addicts can be
observed in England under relatively controlled circumstances, a
whole series of comparative clinical and sociological studies are
possible.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">No simple &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;
answer can be given to the question: &quot;Is the British
approach to addiction a success or a failure?&quot; The question
itself may not be valid in a field that has so much difficulty
with the word &quot;success.&quot; A more accurate question may
be: Is the British approach to addiction helpful or harmful? Even
then, the answer may only be &quot;Yes, but . . .&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Can the British and American approaches to
addiction legitimately be compared? The study of Canadian
addicts' performance in England certainly suggests that such
comparisons no longer can be dismissed out of hand. In England,
at least, comparisons are made. Everywhere I went, opinion on
this was uniform. On my final day in London, a Home Office
official, whose knowledge of drug addiction has brought him an
international reputation, summed it up:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">&quot;We don't want to force our system on
you, but for God's sake don't bring your system over here.&quot;<br>
</font> </p>

Committee), para. 22, July 31, 1965.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">2. There are about 500 British physicians
licensed to prescribe heroin and cocaine to addicts. This is a
far larger figure than the actual number of physicians working
within the drug clinics. However, a special license to prescribe
these drugs has become part of the British medical profession's

<h1><a name="OLE_LINK2">Organization of Staff</a></h1>

<hr>

<p>In October 1939 Police Commissioner Lewis J. Valentine
designated Deputy Chief Inspector Daniel Curtayne, Lieutenant
Edward Cooper, Sergeant Bernard Boylan and Detective Joseph
Loures of the Narcotic Squad of the Police Department of the City
of New York to cooperate with the Mayor's Committee on Marihuana.
These police officials submitted a list of intelligent young
officers with a suitable background. From this list six officers
were selected: two policewomen, and four policemen, one of whom
was a Negro. They were: Mr. James Coen, Mr. William Connolly, Mr.
Benjamin Weissner, Mr. John Hughes, Miss Adelaide Knowles and
Miss Olive Cregan. These police officers were encouraged to read
literature on the subject of marihuana and to familiarize
themselves with some of the characteristics of the plant, as well
as of marihuana cigarettes. They became expert in detecting the
aroma of burning marihuana, and were thus able to recognize it
and to identify its use in a social gathering. </p>

<p>Regular assignments were made by the director of the survey.
At intervals each officer dictated a general report on his
activities and findings to a stenographer engaged by the
Committee. Frequent conferences were held in the office of the
director of the survey, at which time individual reports were
discussed in detail and evaluated. </p>

<p>An attempt was made to give the &quot;marihuana squad&quot; a
psychological approach to the performance of their duties. At no
time were these officers permitted to make known their activity
to other members of the police force, or to make arrests. This
arrangement was considered essential in order that they might
maintain an effective role of investigator without being in any
respect recognized as police officers. Although they were members
of the police force and constantly in contact with violators of
law, their immediate superiors cooperated to an extreme degree by
allowing the &quot;marihuana squad&quot; to report directly to
the director of the survey. </p>

<p>While on duty the squad actually &quot;lived&quot; in the
environment in which marihuana smoking or peddling was suspected.
They frequented poolrooms, bars and grills, dime-a-dance halls,
other dance halls to which they took their own partners, theatres
-- backstage and in the audience -- roller-skating rinks,
subways, public toilets, parks and docks They consorted with the
habitues of these places, chance acquaintances on the street,
loiterers around schools, subways and bus terminals. They posed
as &quot;suckers&quot; from out of town and as students in
colleges and high schools. </p>

<p>We highly commend these officers individually for their
exceptionally good performances. The aid given by Deputy Chief
Inspector Daniel Curtayne, Lieutenant Edward Cooper, Sergeant
Bernard Boylan and Detective Joseph Loures throughout deserves
mention and appreciation. At times we must have been a source of
annoyance to them, but our requests were always cheerfully met
and assistance heartily extended.<br>
</p>

<p>Method of Retail Distribution </p>

<p>In general, marihuana is used in the form of a cigarette.
Occasionally some individuals chew the &quot;weed&quot; and seem
to get the same effect as do others through smoking. The common
names for the cigarettes are: muggles, reefers, Indian hemp,
weed, tea, gage and sticks. Cigarettes made of marihuana differ
in size as do cigarettes made of tobacco: they are long, short,
thick or thin. </p>

<p>The price varies in accordance with the accepted opinion as to
the potency of the marihuana used in the cigarettes, and this
appears to be determined by the place of origin. The cheapest
brand is known as &quot;sass-fras,&quot; and retails for
approximately three for 50 cents. It is made of the marihuana
that is grown in the United States. Smokers do not consider such
marihuana very potent. They have found that they must consume a
greater number of cigarettes in order to obtain the desired
effect colloquially termed as &quot;high.&quot; This opinion,
expressed by smokers in the Borough of Manhattan, is at variance
with that of some authorities who believe that marihuana grown in
the United States is as potent as the marihuana grown in other
countries. </p>

<p>The &quot;panatella&quot; cigarette, occasionally referred to
as &quot;meserole,&quot; is considered to be more potent than the
&quot;sass-fras&quot; and usually retails for approximately 25
cents each. The hemp from which the &quot;panatella&quot; is made
comes from Central and South America. </p>

<p>&quot;Gungeon&quot; is considered by the marihuana smoker as
the highest grade of marihuana. It retails for about one dollar
per cigarette. The &quot;kick&quot; resulting from the use of
this cigarette is reached more quickly than from the use of
&quot;sassafras&quot; or &quot;panatella.&quot; It appears to be
the consensus that the marihuana used to make the
&quot;gungeon&quot; comes from Africa. The sale of this cigarette
is restricted to a clientele whose economic status is of a higher
level than the majority of marihuana smokers. </p>

<p>A confirmed marihuana user can readily distinguish the quality
and potency of various brands, just as the habitual cigarette or
cigar smoker is able to differentiate between the qualities of
tobacco. Foreign-made cigarette paper is often used in order to
convince the buyer that the &quot;tea is right from the
boat.&quot; </p>

<p>There are two channels for the distribution of marihuana
cigarettes-- the independent peddler and the &quot;tea-pad.&quot;
From general observations, conversations with &quot;pad&quot;
owners, and discussions with peddlers, the investigators
estimated that there were about 500 &quot;tea-pads&quot; in
Harlem and at least 500 peddlers. </p>

<p>A &quot;tea-pad&quot; is a room or an apartment in which
people gather to smoke marihuana. The majority of such places are
located in the Harlem district. It is our impression that the
landlord, the agent, the superintendent or the janitor is aware
of the purposes for which the premises are rented. The
&quot;tea-pad&quot; is furnished according to the clientele it
expects to serve. Usually, each &quot;tea-pad&quot; has
comfortable furniture, a radio, victrola or, as in most
instances, a rented nickelodeon. The lighting is more or less
uniformly dim, with blue predominating. An incense is considered
part of the furnishings. The walls are frequently decorated with
pictures of nude subjects suggestive of perverted sexual
practices. The furnishings, as described, are believed to be
essential as a setting for those participating in smoking
marihuana. </p>

<p>Most &quot;tea-pads&quot; have their trade restricted to the
sale of marihuana. Some places did sell marihuana and whisky, and
a few places also served as houses of prostitution. Only one
&quot;teapad&quot; was found which served as a house of
prostitution, and in which one could buy marihuana, whisky, and
opium. </p>

<p>The marihuana smoker derives greater satisfaction if he is
smoking in the presence of others. His attitude in the
&quot;tea-pad&quot; is that of a relaxed individual, free from
the anxieties and cares of the realities of life. The
&quot;tea-pad&quot; takes on the atmosphere of a very congenial
social club. The smoker readily engages in conversation with
strangers, discussing freely his pleasant reactions to the drug
and philosophizing on subjects pertaining to life in a manner
which, at times, appears to be out of keeping with his
intellectual level. A constant observation was the extreme
willingness to share and puff on each other's cigarettes. A
boisterous, rowdy atmosphere did not prevail and on the rare
occasions when there appeared signs indicative of a belligerent
attitude on the part of a smoker, he was ejected or forced to
become more tolerant and quiescent. </p>

<p>One of the most interesting setups of a &quot;tea-pad,&quot;
which was clearly not along orthodox lines from the business
point of view, was a series of pup tents arranged on a roof-top
in Harlem. Those present proceeded to smoke their cigarettes in
the tents. When the desired effect of the drug had been obtained
they all merged into the open and engaged in a discussion of
their admiration of the stars and the beauties of nature. </p>

<p>Because of the possibility of spreading disease, note should
be taken of what seems to be a custom known as
&quot;pick-up&quot; smoking. It is an established practice
whereby a marihuana cigarette is lit and after one or two
inhalations is passed on to the next person. This procedure is
repeated until all present have had an opportunity to take a puff
or two on the cigarette. </p>

<p>Occasionally a &quot;tea-pad&quot; owner may have peddlers who
sell their wares in other localities and at the same time serve
as procurers for those who wish to smoke marihuana on the
premises. </p>

<p>One also finds other methods of retail distribution. After
proper introduction, one may be able to purchase the cigarette in
certain places. This is not an easy procedure, but it can be
accomplished. In some bar-and-grills, restaurants, and bars our
investigators were able to establish contact with someone who in
turn, would introduce them to a peddler who apparently made
regular rounds of these places in order to sell cigarettes. It
appears that the owners of such places are not aware of this
practice, and in many instances they would discharge any employee
known to be directly or indirectly associated with the sale of
marihuana. </p>

<p>On rare occasions public guides, if properly approached would
refer one to a place where the &quot;reefer&quot; could be
bought. There was no evidence that the guide received money when
acting as go- between. Terminal porters, mainly Negroes, appeared
to be more directly connected with the traffic of marihuana. They
were more conversant with the subject and it was easier for them
to establish contact between purchaser and peddler. </p>

<p>Marihuana smoking is very common in the theatres of Harlem
according to the observations of the investigators. We have
reason to believe that in some instances, perhaps few in number,
employees actually sold cigarettes on the premises. In the Harlem
dance halls smoking was frequently observed either in the
lavatories or on the main floor. The patrons as well as the
musicians were seen in the act of smoking. There was no evidence
of sales being made by employees on the premises, or that there
was any gain on the part of the owners or employees in permitting
this practice. Whereas the smoking of marihuana was not
encouraged, nothing was done to prohibit such practice. </p>

<p>There are specific sections in the Borough of Manhattan where
the sale of marihuana cigarettes appears to be localized: 1) the
Harlem district; 2) the Broadway area, a little east and west of
Broadway and extending from 42nd Street to S9th Street. While it
is true that one may buy the cigarette in other districts, it is
not as easily obtainable as in the two localities mentioned. <br>

<p><font size="4">Beyond Prohibition</font><font size="5"> </font></p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Report of the Redfern Legal Centre Drug
Law Reform Project</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">September 1996</font> </p>

<p><font size="4">2. Steps To Harm Reduction<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">Our existing drugs policy, grounded in
prohibition, is failing. Drug use continues at significant
levels, the drug trade continues to flourish, and the social
consequences of a thriving drugs black market - including
significant property crime and police corruption - continue to
cause concern.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">We need to continue the process begun a decade
ago with the introduction of legal needle and syringe exchanges.
That is, we need to continue to shift the primary policy focus
from prohibition to harm reduction: to rely less on the criminal
law to discourage drug use and supply, and more on education,
treatment and research to make drug use as safe and responsible
as possible. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Our current approach to drugs confuses legal
status with questions of safety. Both alcohol and marijuana are
widely used in social situations, both methadone and heroin are
highly addictive, both Prozac and ecstasy induce comparable
feelings of well-being. Yet the differing legal status of each of
these drugs skews social attitudes to their appropriate use, and
distorts accurate education messages about their effects and the
dangers of misuse.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">There is a limit to the constructive harm
reduction measures which can be undertaken without changes to the
law. We have probably already reached the point at which the laws
criminalising drug use represent a real impediment to programmes
aimed at minimising the personal and social harm which can be
caused by drug use. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Reducing Drug-related Harm</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Harm reduction means aiming at reducing the
harm that drugs can cause to users and to the broader community.
It involves accepting that drug use will never be eliminated,
even if we do not approve of it. Harm reduction should be the
standard against which we measure the success or failure of
existing drug laws, and proposals for change.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Redfern Legal Centre has proposed that in the
long term, we should implement a system of controlled
availability for most currently illicit drugs. The Centre's Harm
Reduction Model of Controlled Drug Availability sets out
principles for controlled availability which would produce the
greatest degree of harm reduction, and sketches some case studies
to illustrate what these principles might mean in practice.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">In the immediate future, we should take some
less dramatic steps towards reducing drug related harm. Here we
outline some immediate steps we should take to implement harm
reduction principles in the short term.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Policy Objectives</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Although drugs policy could never be described
as uncontroversial, there is some common ground. Most would agree
that drugs policy should be framed in the context of health
objectives and social policy, not with the criminal law as the
starting point. Where drug use is problematic, it should be
addressed as a health issue, not a legal issue.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">What does this mean in concrete terms?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The changes we recommend here address what we
consider to be the most significant drug policy issues impacting
on public health. The particular objectives of the proposals made
here are </font></p>

<p><font size="2">1. To establish the legal environment for the
implementation of effective education and other health programs
to:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">reduce overdose deaths</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">reduce the number of new Hepatitis C infections
associated with injecting drug use</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">at least maintain (and if possible reduce)
existing low levels of new HIV infection through injecting drug
use</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">improve the level of responsible disposal of
used needles</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">2. Reduce socially harmful impact of criminal
justice system on users of currently illicit drugs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Taking the steps detailed below will not solve
all the problems associated with drug use. Change to the existing
legal framework must of necessity be made gradually. Once the
proposals for change outlined here are implemented and evaluated,
we can consider what further changes to drug law and policy are
necessary.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">These measures would have only a small initial
impact on crime rates and police corruption. These social harms
result directly from the drug laws particularly laws about drug
supply. We need to move towards greater regulation of the drugs
market to enable us as a society to influence the size and
operation of the drugs market. Achieving the maximum public
health benefits will require regulatory control over matters such
as purity, weight, recommended dosages, and labelling.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The greatest source of social harm associated
with drugs is the black market. The black market, with its
extraordinary profits, fuels police corruption, and generates
property crime. And the black market is an unregulated market,
with no controls on drug quality, multiplying the dangers of drug
use. The enormous profits to be made will always draw a steady
stream of new entrepreneurs to the production and distribution of
drugs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The size of the black market is determined by
the laws we make about drug supply. While it is likely that we
will never be able to completely eliminate the drugs black
market, changes to the legal approach to drugs can reduce and
marginalise the negative social impact of a contracted illicit
market.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">We must explore alternative strategies to
control the size of the black market, including considering
alternative changes to the law about supply. But we cannot
sensibly undertake that consideration without first resolving
legal and policy issues about use and possession.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Each of the measures outlined below would
represent an important step on the way to creating the legal
framework for a comprehensive harm reduction strategy.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">PROPOSALS FOR CHANGE</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">1 . Personal Use and Possession</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Penalising drug users for the activity of drug
use does little if anything to discourage drug-taking.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Criminalising drug using behaviour adds to the
social and personal burden on drug users without any
corresponding social benefit. The current laws force drug use
underground, compounding health problems and making it more
difficult to implement effective public health programs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Police drugs strategy states that police
resources should be directed towards drug traffickers and
large-scale suppliers, rather than drug users. However, the fact
is that 60% of drug matters prosecuted involve drug use or
possession offences.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Because there is a distinct socioeconomic bias
in the manner in which different communities are policed, there
is a differential outcome in how these charges are laid. This
means that the drug laws impact unfairly on the poor, the
homeless, Aborigines and the young - disproportionately to their
actual patterns of usage.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Changing our approach to the legal treatment of
drug use would assist in HIV/Hepatitis C prevention by allowing
injecting drug users to access (and dispose of) new needles and
syringes without fear of police harassment. It would also remove
existing disincentives for drug users (such as marijuana smokers)
to openly discuss their use with doctors and other health
professionals. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">There are a number of constructive alternatives
to the criminalisation of personal use and possession of drugs.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">The options are to:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">a. abolish the offences of use and possession;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">b. abolish the offence of self administration
only; and/or</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">c. vary enforcement practices</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">We will briefly discuss the merits of these
alternative approaches.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Option a. Abolish the offences of use and
possession </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The most straightforward solution is to remove
the offence of drug using and possession. That is, it would no
longer be a criminal offence to use an illicit drug, nor to
possess a small quantity for personal use (say 30 grams for
cannabis, 1 gram for heroin, amphetamine and other powders). In
order to minimise the number of cannabis users accessing the
black market, cultivation of up to five cannabis plants per
household should also be allowed. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Removing these offences would remove the legal
obstacle to drug users seeking appropriate health care, including
the estimated 600,000 cannabis users in this State. It would
reduce fear of police harassment by injecting drug users
accessing needle and syringe exchanges and, especially,
contribute to responsible disposal of used needles. Because
possession of a used needle is evidence of the offence of drug
use, the law currently creates incentives to dispose of used
needles quickly rather than thoughtfully.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Removing these offences would be consistent
with existing police strategy which states that police resources
should be directed towards drug traffickers, not drug users.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Option b. Abolish the offence of self
administration only</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Because drug use (&quot;self
administration&quot;) and drug possession are separate offences
under the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act, it is possible to
remove the offence of use without any change to the law
prohibiting drug possession.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Removing the criminality of the act of using a
drug would improve the capacity of educators and researchers to
communicate in direct and plain terms with people about their
past and present levels of drug use, and use behaviours.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In practical terms, it would mean that a person
who had recently consumed a drug but had no other drugs in their
possession, would be not subject to arrest or criminal charges.
This would encourage larger numbers of injecting drug users to
responsibly dispose of used needles and syringes, positively
contributing to reduction in new HIV and hepatitis infections,
and to community perceptions of public safety.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Most self administration convictions result
from the person admitting having consumed a drug, without other
evidence (blood or urine tests are not undertaken to support
these charges). This law is selectively enforced against those
who are most vulnerable and least aware of their civil rights
(especially the right to silence).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If the self administration provision is
withdrawn, there would remain ample legal power for the police to
control offensive or anti-social behaviour which might accompany
drug use. Appropriate community policing strategies would address
community concerns about unacceptable behaviour in public places
by people under the influence of illicit drugs, while also
achieving desirable public health and social equity results.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Option c. Vary enforcement practices</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The alternative to legislative amendment is to
change how these laws are enforced. There are several ways in
which this might be done.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">(i) Better directed police discretion</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The police have the discretion not to arrest or
lay a charge in a wide range of circumstances, subject to their
duty to protect the peace and to uphold the law. This exercise of
discretion applies in the enforcement of the drug laws. In
practice this means that many police officers choose, in many
circumstances, not to lay charges where they become aware of
minor drug offences. The anecdotal evidence is that the police
are increasingly exercising their discretion in this way, perhaps
especially with cannabis.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The exercise of police discretion in this way
is not only legitimate but desirable. It contributes positively
to public health outcomes, and reduces what would otherwise be a
literally intolerable burden on criminal justice resources if
every episode of drug use or possession which came to police
notice were prosecuted.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It is desirable however that there be some
standardisation of this exercise of discretion, to achieve
greater uniformity of police practice (and therefore social
equity) and to better target particular public health objectives.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">We propose that the Commissioner's Instructions
should be amended to give guidance to police on the exercise of
their discretion.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Some suggestions are:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Police guidelines should specifically
discourage arrest in overdose and similar medical emergency
situations, of either the overdose patient or their associates.
Knowing that there was no risk of arrest would encourage people
experiencing overdose, or their friends, to seek medical help as
early as possible. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">People suffering overdose, or other physical or
psychological distress, should be able to access medical services
without fear of arrest. There are some 220 drug overdose
fatalities in NSW each year. Many of these deaths are
preventable. Studies show that one in three heroin users report
having had at least one overdose experience.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Police should be encouraged not to harass
clients of methadone clinics, even if known drug users are likely
to congregate there. [This would be an extension of existing
guidelines which discourage police harassment of clients of
needle and syringe exchanges.]</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Existing Commissioner's Instructions
(Instruction 16.02), say that police should not interrupt
injection, nor deliberately break syringes. In fact, these
practices still occur. Relevant police instructions should be
made the subject of training and greater management direction.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">The Police Service should undertake a
comprehensive examination of its practices and protocols as they
impact on drugs policy. The fact that there are existing
Commissioner's Instructions which are not being applied raises
questions about the capacity of the Police Service to respond
flexibly and appropriately in this area, in the absence of
legislative reform. If measures are taken to develop the
application of police discretion in drugs policy, it must be
closely monitored to assess the degree of compliance with
guidelines. If this approach does not significantly improve the
current negative impact of law enforcement on effective drugs
policy, the only alternative is to legislate change to laws.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">(ii) Formal police cautions</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The recent Victorian Premier's Drug Advisory
Council Report (the Pennington Report) recommended that the use
and possession of illicit drugs be dealt with through a system of
automatic formal police cautions for first offenders (with
voluntary referral to drug assessment and treatment services).
Mandatory good behaviour bonds would be imposed as a sentence for
second offenders. Third offenders would be dealt with by a court
in the normal way (ie, by decision of the magistrate to impose
fines, community service orders, or other appropriate penalty).</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">A mandatory caution/bond system for drug use
and possession offences would make police contact with drug users
less negative than it is now (except for repeat offenders), and
would allow law enforcement to be accompanied by referral to
treatment or counselling services in appropriate cases.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If introduced, this system should be closely
monitored for its effect on the number and type of cases brought
before the courts. (It should be noted that introducing a system
of police referral to drug treatment services may result in an
increased demand for those services, which are now significantly
under-researched.) </font></p>

<p><font size="2">(iii) On-the-spot fines</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Some jurisdictions (South Australia, the
Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory) have
introduced a system of on-the-spot fines as a method of
&quot;decriminalising&quot; the personal use and possession of
marijuana.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Since this system was implemented in South
Australia in 1987, there has been a 450% increase in the number
of fine notices issued (although research shows that marijuana
usage has increased only slightly, in line with increases in
other States). Half of the 18,000 people issued with notices last
year did not pay their fine on time, exposing them to the risk of
arrest, prosecution and incurring a criminal record.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In practice therefore, this initiative has
actually increased the cost of police and court time devoted to
marijuana law enforcement.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In the ACT and NT, it is too early to say
whether there will be a similar escalation in the number of
notices issued. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">There are few apparent advantages in adopting
this measure. The other alternatives offer either more complete
and systematic solutions, or the opportunity for more flexible
policing practices.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"> Remove prison as a sentencing option for
drug use or possession</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If the offences of drug use and possession are
not abolished, then at the least, imprisonment should be removed
as an available sentencing option.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Prison sentences are a completely inappropriate
penalty for minor drug possession and use offences. Imprisonment
has never been evaluated for its effects on drug use or
possession recidivism, although anecdotal evidence suggests that
it does not deter ongoing drug use. Research into the question
should be encouraged.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">About 150 people are gaoled each year in NSW
for drug use or possession of small quantities of drugs. In 1995
(the most recent figures available), there were 62 people gaoled
for use or possession of marijuana, 61 were gaoled for use or
possession of heroin, and 44 were gaoled for use or possession of
other drugs. Although custodial sentences of up to eight months
were imposed, the period of imprisonment for most was less than
two months. In relative terms, these prison terms would be
considered short. However, considering the minor nature of the
offences and prevailing social attitudes, they are
extraordinarily harsh. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">3 . Allow use of cannabis for medical purposes </font></p>

<p><font size="2">If the offences of drug use and possession are
removed, there is no need for separate treatment for those who
use cannabis for genuinely therapeutic purposes. However, if
those offences remain, an exception should exist for the medical
applications of cannabis.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Cannabis in smokable form is a valuable
alternative to other medical treatments for people living with
AIDS and for some cancer and glaucoma patients. It is useful for
nausea and pain relief, and to stimulate appetite. Smokable
cannabis is now used in the community for these purposes without
recognition, support or medical supervision.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Synthetic cannabis products in tablet form are
available on prescription, but they are not satisfactory. They
are expensive and reported to be less effective in achieving the
desired therapeutic results. Many patients who smoke marijuana to
control nausea are unable to swallow tablets. For some conditions
(eg, weight loss associated with AIDS), there are no effective
alternatives.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">As well, numerous people living with hepatitis
use cannabis as a social alternative to alcohol.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">4 Allow possession of drug equipment as well as
needles and syringes</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Possession of equipment intended for use of
prohibited drugs is illegal - needles and syringes are the only
exception. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">It is anomalous to publicly fund the
distribution of needles and syringes, but not to allow the
possession of swabs, sterile water and tourniquets for the
purpose of using illegal drugs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Allowing the legal possession of all
intravenous drug using equipment would assist in HIV prevention.
It would also assist in preventing Hepatitis C infection, which
often results from sharing equipment other than needles and
syringes., and it would assist in holistic harm reduction (eg,
using sterile water to reduce the risk of injecting bacteria
which can cause a range of illnesses).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The sale and possession of bongs for the
smoking of cannabis is also illegal even though using a bong is
probably less harmful than smoking cannabis cigarettes. Further
research should be undertaken into the relative physical harms of
different methods of consuming cannabis (eg, in cigarettes,
through bongs, or in foods).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Legalising the sale and possession of cannabis
smoking equipment would assist education strategies aimed at
encouraging cannabis users to use in relatively safe ways.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">5 . Provide safe injecting spaces</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Legal safe injecting spaces (or &quot;shooting
rooms&quot;) would considerably reduce the harm associated with
injecting drug use in public places like parks and laneways. Safe
injecting spaces could reduce drug overdose deaths, and should
also reduce the number of used syringes unsafely disposed of in
public places. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Publicly funded, safe injecting spaces should
be introduced on a trial basis in areas of existing high
intravenous drug use. The trial should be conducted over two
years, with an initial review after six months.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Potential benefits include:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">i. Reduction in injecting drug use in public
places (such as parks and laneways), with the consequent public
health dangers posed by used needles being left in those places.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">ii. Improved access and personal safety for
ambulance officers and other health workers treating overdoses.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">The difficulty with introducing such a trial is
that the authorities are wary of funding, even tolerating,
facilities at which people would break the law (ie by self
administration). We have made a number of suggestions above about
reform of the law, or at least law enforcement practices, around
drug use and possession. Introducing any of those proposals would
clear the way legally for the introduction of safe injecting
spaces.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The proposal for safe injecting spaces is a
logical extension of existing needle and syringe exchange
programs. The legal framework to allow shooting rooms to operate
(in the absence of more far-reaching changes to the law), would
be similar to the arrangements for needle and syringe exchange
programs, namely: </font></p>

<p><font size="2">legislative amendment to make it not an offence
to inject a prohibited drug on site at an approved safe injecting
place (at least for the duration of a trial);</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">instructions to police to not harass the
clients of the facilities (just as existing instructions direct
police to not harass needle exchange clients)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">statutory amendment to protect workers in safe
injecting places from prosecution for aiding and abetting
offences. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">6 Allow use, possession and supply of Narcan
without prescription</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Narcan is an anti-narcotic used to revive
people in the event of narcotic overdose. It has no pleasurable
effects, and no effect on someone who has not used heroin or
other narcotics. Wider availability of Narcan has been
recommended by researchers at the National Drug and Alcohol
Research Centre as an effective way to reduce fatal heroin
overdoses.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If Narcan were to be made more readily
available, it should be accompanied by an appropriately targeted
education campaign to ensure that Narcan is understood to be a
first aid measure only. The person revived from the overdose by a
shot of Narcan requires further medical attention, involving
either calling an ambulance or attendance at a hospital.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">FUTURE CHANGE</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The implementation of these proposals should be
followed by continuing attention to laws and programmes which
impact adversely on public health and other social programmes.
Relevant government agencies should undertake a comprehensive
review to identify which laws require amendment to further reduce
drug related harm. Key agencies to be involved in such a review
are the Departments of Health, Attorney-General's, Police, and
School Education.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In the longer term, the nature and pace of
further changes to drug law and policy will need to be considered
and debated.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Implementing some or all of the above proposals
would significantly improve public health outcomes. Making these
changes would allow the community to decide whether and how to
take further steps.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">We should begin now, in a measured way, to
explore and implement workable alternatives to the failure of
drugs prohibition. </font></p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Report of the Redfern Legal Centre Drug
Law Reform Project</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">September 1996<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Executive Summary<br>
</strong></font><font size="2"></font></p>

<p><font size="2">The Redfern Legal Centre Drug Law Reform
Project began in mid 1994. Its objectives were to promote
informed public discussion about drug law reform, and to
contribute to bringing forward reform of the drug laws.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Project's main achievements over the past
two years are:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Published discussion papers, fact sheets,
stickers and a poster promoting a range of initiatives to end the
current prohibition policy on currently illicit drugs and move
towards a model of controlled availability; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Convened a series of community forums in South
Sydney and Cabramatta on ways that drug laws impact on the work
of community and health organisations;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Held discussions with a number of NSW
Parliamentarians, including Ministers and their advisors;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Participated in several conferences and
seminars, including the International Conference on the Reduction
of Drug Related Harm Provided formal, detailed submissions to a
range of inquiries including the Wood Royal Commission into the
NSW Police Service and the Victorian Premier's Drug Advisory
Council (Pennington Committee).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">This report includes two of the Project's most
significant publications:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Steps Towards Harm Reduction</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Harm Reduction Model of Controlled Drug
Availability. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">In addition, this report provides summaries of
comments on these publications from a diverse range of
organisations and individuals. The comments show that the Project
and its publications have made a significant contribution to the

<p><font size="2"><strong>Report of the Redfern Legal Centre Drug
Law Reform Project</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">September 1996</font> </p>

<p><font size="4">1 . History of Project</font><font size="5"> </font></p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Background</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">The Redfern Legal Centre Drug Law Reform
Project began in mid 1994. Its objectives were to promote
informed public discussion about drug law reform, and to
contribute to bringing forward reform of the drug laws.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Redfern Legal Centre provided funding to pay
one part-time worker to coordinate the Project and to carry out
many of its tasks. The Project was oversighted by a small but
typically enthusiastic committee, which reported to the Centre's
Management Committee. The funding for the Project came (until
February 1996) from the Centre's own resources, primarily
litigation costs. From March until September 1996, the Project
was funded by a grant from the Law Foundation of NSW</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Redfern Legal Centre undertook this Project for
several reasons:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">1. Drug prohibition fosters crime (because
prohibition artificially inflates prices for drugs on the black
market). Abandoning prohibition would be the simplest single way
to achieve a noticeable reduction in property crime, and to a
lesser but still important extent, violent crime.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">2. Those affected by drug-inspired crime are
primarily the socially disadvantaged. Drug law reform is
desirable as a social equity measure.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">3. Prohibition contributes to police
corruption. It is no accident that the clear majority of police
named adversely in evidence before the Wood Royal Commission into
police corruption are in some way connected to drugs - police
stealing drugs or money from drug suppliers, police selling
drugs, police planting drugs on suspects as false evidence.
Prohibition makes the drug trade so extravagantly profitable (it
is the second largest trade in the world) that it creates
enormous temptations for police and other officials. We cannot
hope to significantly reduce the opportunities for police
corruption while the drugs prohibition continues.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">4. Prohibition has a significant negative
impact on the legal system. Dealing with people facing drug
charges, or charges of property crime generated by the drugs
black market, creates an enormous drain on the courts, and in
particular on public funds available to provide legal services
for the poor and disadvantaged. Reducing drug-related crime would
free up law enforcement resources for other activities, and would
improve the resource capacity of the Legal Aid Commission and
community legal services to pursue other matters, such as
consumer claims and antidiscrimination cases.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">5. Public health outcomes are compromised by
laws which drive drug use underground. In particular, the drug
laws hamper efforts to contain the spread of HIV and Hepatitis B
and C.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">6. Despite years of community debate and the
strength of the case for reform, prohibition has been fiercely
resilient . Reliance on the criminal law to control behaviour in
other areas of moral or personal choice gambling, sex work,
abortion, censorship - has generally receded in recent decades,
with the drug laws the notable exception. The demise of
prohibition is not as inevitable as it perhaps once appeared to
be.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">We believe that meaningful reform of our drug
laws necessarily involves reconsidering the laws about supply as
well as possession and use of drugs, and laws about other drugs
as well as cannabis.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Harm reduction is a pragmatic approach which
emphasises reducing the personal and social harms associated with
drug use, while accepting that eliminating drug use is
impossible. Harm reduction has been officially the central goal
of Australian drugs policy since the mid 1980s, although most
public resources devoted to the drug problem continue to promote
prohibition (eg, funds to police and customs services and
unrealistic, wholly negative drug education). We believe that
harm reduction (in any meaningful definition) is incompatible
with prohibition. The Project has attempted to develop coherent
harm reduction strategies, focusing on measures which would
reduce or eliminate the drugs black market. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Community Forums</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Project convened a series of community
forums at which service providers in the health and community
sectors in particular were invited to identify, from their
perspective, the ways in which existing legal approaches to drugs
impacted on their work, and to identify which legal framework
could best support drug treatment and education programs. These
forums were held in both South Sydney, where the Legal Centre is
located, and in Cabramatta, Sydney's major heroin distribution
point. The discussion at these forums was invaluable in assisting
the Project to developing strategies and proposals for change.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Publications</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Two discussion papers were written and
distributed in the course of the Project.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Harm Reduction Model of Controlled Drug
Availability, published in May 1995, attempted to tackle
concretely the question of what exactly drug law reform could
look like. Most previous proposals for law reform were either
inadequate (eg, the on-the spot fine model adopted in various
forms in South Australia, the ACT and the Northern Territory), or
airy generalisations about the possibility of regulating or
deregulating the drugs market (with the idea of controlled
availability little more than a slogan). We considered it a
priority to do the work of systematically applying harm reduction
principles to all aspects of drug consumption, production and
distribution - in an open-minded but hopefully not fanciful way.
The Harm Reduction Model therefore represents a detailed
projection of what controlled availability might look like in
practice.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Harm Reduction Model was widely circulated
and was endorsed by a number of community organisations and
individuals. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">An updated and expanded second edition of The
Harm Reduction Model was published in July 1996. Importantly, the
second edition included a set of Principles for Controlled Drug
Availability to complement the essentially practical proposals
illustrating some possible means of regulating drug supply and
consumption. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The Project's other discussion paper was Steps
to Harm Reduction. A companion document to the Harm Reduction
Model, this paper addressed the present and short-term future. It
provided an analysis of the possible immediate steps which could
and should be taken in drugs policy and drug law reform. Again,
the value of the paper lay in its attempt to be detailed and
specific. The paper is a blueprint for reform, providing a list
of proposals to achieve a graduated replacement of prohibition
with harm reduction. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">These two papers form the major part of this
report.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Project also produced:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Two very popular bumper stickers (slogans End
Prohibition: Support Drug Law Reform and Break the Crime Cycle:
Support Drug Law Reform)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">A full colour poster, a graphic presentation of
what the future of drugs policy might look like.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">A series of Fact Sheets with statistics and
other information detailing the social impact of existing drug
laws. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Discussions with politicians</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Throughout the Project, we held discussions
with a number of NSW Parliamentarians, including Ministers and
their advisors. It must be said that the political climate proved
to be not conducive to change on drug policy, despite some early
encouraging if ambiguous statements from the incoming Carr
Government. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Issues discussed included many of the issues
dealt with in this report, including the desirability of
introducing a trial of legal safe injecting spaces, and a
possible Parliamentary motion on prioritising harm reduction in
drugs policy.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Inquiries</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Project also provided formal, detailed
submissions on proposals for law reform to the following
inquiries.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Wood Royal Commission into the NSW Police
Service</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Victorian Premier's Drug Advisory Council
(Pennington Committee)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Commonwealth Access to Justice Inquiry.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Conference papers</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">During the life of the Project, we participated
in a number of conferences and seminars. Perhaps the most
significant conference papers we presented were a paper in
September 1995 to the NSW Corrective Health Services Symposium on
Drug-Related Crime, and the two papers to the 7th International
Conference on the Reduction of Drug Related Harm, in Hobart in
March 1996. <br>

size="5"> </font></p>

<p><font size="2">A version of the Steps towards Harm Reduction
section of this report was provided to people and organisations
with expertise or interest in the area of drugs policy and drugs
law, together with a questionnaire (see Appendix 2) seeking
comments on the paper.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Responses were sought from 55 individuals and
organisations (see Appendix 1). Written responses were received
from 21 respondents and eight responses were obtained by
interview (29 responses in all). Given the low response rate and
the ways that respondents were selected, this survey is not
designed to provide research evidence about support for or
against changes to drug laws. However, the responses allow us to
see where support appears to be forming and what areas continue
to be the subject of intense debate.</font> </p>

individuals and organisations. Organisations are listed when they
provided an organisational response: otherwise the individuals

<p><font size="2">Ken Marslew</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Angela and Tony Wood Dr Peter B Paisley</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">(Total responses do not always add up to 29
because some respondents did not answer all questions and some
gave overall support or opposition, rather than provide details
on specific points.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Do you support some change in the legal current
approach to personal use and possession?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">All respondents agreed that some change was
necessary. The overwhelming majority favoured change in the
direction of some liberalisation of existing legal approaches.
One respondent supported change in the form of higher penalties
for use and possession offences. One supported additional
intervention (eg, education) as well as police intervention.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;There is (and has been for decades)
overwhelming evidence that the current system not only does not
work but is cataclysmically harmful.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;[Supported] for cannabis use/possession
only. Population use of cannabis has reached the point where
prohibition does more harm than good.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Counterproductive and contrary to
principles of harm minimisation and National Drugs Strategy to
criminalise users.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Should be less criminal records for these
offences, shorter time for expungement of criminal records.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">It is important to note that almost all
respondents support some change, as one of the findings of this
process is that views are polarised on the points contained in
the Steps Towards Harm Reduction. While most respondents
supported the need for changes in all of the areas covered by the
document, several respondents opposed most such changes. Those
generally in favour of change included some church groups,
doctors, lecturers, researchers, drug educators, drug treatment
staff and community based organisations. Those generally opposed
included some church groups, doctors association, drug treatment
staff and some community members.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Several respondents chose to write letters in
support of their general position. These general comments
included:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Issues of dependency could be more easily
addressed and the transmission of blood borne viruses could be
more efficiently reduced by taking the Steps Towards Harm
Reduction.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Too much attention is focused on the
question of whether the present system of drug prohibition is
working. In my view, the answer is clearly that prohibition is
not working ... But accepting that prohibition has failed is not
enough. Whether we should get rid of it depends on what we can
come up with as a replacement. Criminal law is not the only means
of regulation nor is its central presence in drug control
strategy inevitable ... The real choice is about what type of
state control is to replace prohibition as the dominant
strategy.&quot; (original emphasis)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;The case here tends to be overstated by
extrapolations and generalisations ... There cannot be a blanket
approach to encouraging safe and responsible drug use ... There
is no clear evidence that either more restrictive or more liberal
policies have achieved significant impact on the prevalence of
illicit drugs.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;The (United Nations) conventions do
reflect consensus and, with the problem of substance misuse,
there has to be a line drawn somewhere. I believe that drug law
reform, at its worst, acts to destroy all the lines and to leave
only confusion to those who desperately seek direction.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Option a. Abolish the offences of use and
possession </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Eighteen respondents supported this change, six
were opposed, three were unsure.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;It's a victimless crime. What you do to
yourself in the privacy of your own home is no-one's
business.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;[The current law is] counterproductive
socially and economically.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;It would equal approval - a message that
drug use is OK.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;There needs to be community consultations
before progress can occur.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Option b. Abolish the offence of self
administration only</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The proposal to abolish the offence of self
administration only was not included in the questionnaire
completed by respondents. However, one response noted that the
most recent Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy meeting had
resolved to form a Working Party of the National Drug Strategy
Committee to examine the self administration laws in every
jurisdiction. This Working Party is chaired by Mr Neil Bridge of
the NSW Police Service.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Option c. Vary enforcement practices (i) Better
directed police discretion</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The version of the paper circulated for comment
did not include this section, so most respondents did not have
the opportunity to comment on the proposals. The proposals were
discussed with a small number of respondents, who indicated some
support. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">(ii) Formal Police cautions</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Twenty respondents favoured this proposal,
three were opposed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Among the supporters, two indicated broad
support for the concept, but disagreement with the details
proposed. Two supporters expressed the view that this proposal
was a poor alternative to the repeal of the offences. Another
advocated this approach before considering legislative amendment
at a later time.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Police contact, if it is a deterrent,
would be just as effective with a caution or bond as with a
harsher penalty.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Diversion of users away from criminal
charges should be used wherever possible. Unfortunately [the
Department of] Health does not resource sufficient treatment or
counselling services. Magistrates cannot refer if there are no
services. Neither can police.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Less intrusive and punitive. Gives some
option for the individual&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;It should remain a court matter, but with
no convictions recorded.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">(iii) On-the-spot fines</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Seven respondents were in favour of this
proposal, with another one &quot;half in favour&quot; and 15
opposed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The respondent who was partially in favour
suggested that the South Australian experience was not a fair
test of the effectiveness of this approach because the law there
does not allow the police to demand identification. This
respondent suggested a variation on the proposal, with no fines
or other police attention for amount of less than 25 grams (for
cannabis), and fines for quantities in the range of 25 grams to,
say, 100 grams.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Although I favour legalisation, on the
spot fines may be a half way house&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Fines are overused as a sanction.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;They would just fill up the fines yards
and periodic detention centres.&quot; &quot;It is too difficult,
apparently, to prevent net-widening.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">V) Other suggestions</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Respondents were invited to make other
suggestions for legal change concerning personal use and
possession.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Six respondents offered comments.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Policing priorities (I guess goes with
(b)) Licensing of IV users (?), pot smokers(?)&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Some process for referral for assessment
for treatment/ rehabilitation. Need to look at withdrawing
driving licences, eg for methadone patients.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Let people grow what they like. Let the
market place sort it out. Supply good quality seed - kill the
black market. Keep it cheap. Get away from needles.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Referral options - jobs - safe
housing.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Legalise heroin and cannabis.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Continue education and encouragement of
non-use, and not starting to use: eg, experiment.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Remove prison as a sentencing option for drug
use or possession</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Twenty respondents were in favour of this
proposal, and four were opposed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Two of those in favour of this change supported
the establishment of secure, custodial rehabilitation facilities
for some drug users as an alternative to prison.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;What's the point of putting users in
gaol?&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;[Yes] But it should be seldom if ever
used.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Minimise or modify prison sentence,
deviation/direction to rehabilitation or treatment agencies when
possible.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">3 Allow use of cannabis for medical purposes</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Eighteen respondents were in favour of this
proposal, three were opposed. One of those in favour supported
cannabis for medical purposes on prescription only.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Even if it is only a third rate drug -
why not allow some people to benefit?&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Cannabis in smokable form is not the best
available treatment for patients suffering from any
illness.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;For some conditions (eg, AIDS related
weight loss), there is no good alternative.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">4. Allow possession of drug equipment as well
as needles and syringes</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Nineteen respondents favoured the proposal
(including one who supported legal change for bongs, but was
uncertain about injecting equipment), four were opposed. One of
those opposed to this proposal thought that a new offence should
be introduced for irresponsible disposal of used needles and
syringes.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Don't want to encourage drug use.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;It's a proven public health
success.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Present situation is patently
ludicrous.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">5 Provide safe injecting spaces</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Eighteen respondents were in favour of this
proposal, five were opposed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Definitely. Works towards increased safe
disposal (by centralising use), decrease in overdoses (monitored
use), takes away IV use from public facilities like public
toilets, provision of counselling, health monitoring. High
priority change.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Safe for whom? These could assist in
collection of used needles which a good thing. If illegal
supplies of drugs which are being trafficked, these may prove
unsafe for users.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Socially unworkable. The practicalities
of their location and operation are enormous.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Cannot assume beneficial public health
effect especially if current prohibitions remain in place. Also
have to ensure that such places are truly 'safe' and clients are
free from identification and police harassment.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;What about non-metro towns? They may need
them more.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">6 Allow use, possession and supply of Narcan
without prescription</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Eleven respondents were in favour of this
proposal, four were against. Most others were unsure.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;This is well supported in research. There
are practical difficulties with its availability. Needs to be
worked on rather than talked about!&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;I don't want to see kids die.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;100% for it.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;I'm not sure about this, but I suppose I
should logically support it.&quot;<br>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Report of the Redfern Legal Centre Drug
Law Reform Project</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">September 1996</font> </p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>4. Harm Reduction Model of Controlled
Drug Availability (Second Edition)</strong></font><font size="5"><strong>
</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2">This paper is in two Parts. Part A sets out
Principles which should apply to the social and legal management
of currently illicit drugs. Part B provides some examples of how
these Principles might be applied for particular drugs.
Individuals and organisations are invited to endorse the
Principles of Controlled Availability contained in this proposal.
(An earlier version of this paper was published in May 1995.)</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>PART A: PRINCIPLES</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Preamble</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">Prohibition causes enormous social damage
including: </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Vastly increased drug-related property crime by
drug users to pay prices inflated by the black market</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Law enforcement costs to apprehend drug users
and sellers, and those who commit drug-related crime, and
increased costs and delays in the court system to process these
cases</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Corruption flourishing at all levels and in
many forms: profits are so great that few police or other
officials are able to resist the enormous sums offered as bribes</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Violent crime developing from supplier
competition </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Thousands of Australians jailed for drug
related crimes, leading to increased costs for corrective
services and the need for more jails</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Prohibition contributes to the spread of HIV
and other blood-borne diseases such as Hepatitis B and C in the
following ways:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Needle sharing among injectors of some
currently illicit drugs can spread these infections: many drug
users begin to inject to receive the greatest effect from the
smallest quantity of the expensive drug</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Some users of illicit drugs are forced into
high-risk forms of sex to pay for drug use</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Needle and syringe supply programs are
difficult to establish and operate under regular threat of
closure, despite significantly reducing the spread of HIV and
other blood-borne diseases</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Unsafe disposal of used needles and syringes
increases because drug injectors believe that police will use
these articles as the basis for prosecution</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Drug injectors sent to prison continue to use
drugs but have virtually no means to protect themselves from
infection </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Laws prohibiting certain drugs have driven
users of currently illicit drugs from their social support
networks, making it hard to reach them with education messages
about protecting themselves and others from infection</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Marginalisation of drug users (encouraged by
prohibition) has led most Australians to care little what happens
to drug users </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Prohibition causes damage to the health of drug
users (and consequently increases health costs to society) by:</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Users paying black market prices for drugs,
leading to increasing malnutrition and other health deficits
related to poverty</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Adulterants and inconsistent drug type or dose
(caused by unregulated manufacturing due to prohibition) causing
health damage, overdose and death among users of currently
illicit drugs </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Marginalisation of drug users leads to lower
self esteem and decreases motivation for self-care</font> </p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Goals of Rational Drug Policy</strong></font><font
size="4"><strong> </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Drug policy should:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Have realistic goals</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Take account of the different patterns and
types of harms caused by specific drugs</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Be shown to be effective or be changed</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Separate arguments about the consequences of
drug use from arguments about morals</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Be developed in the light of the costs of
control as well as the benefits</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Ensure that the harms caused by the control
regimes themselves do not outweigh the harms prevented by them</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Recognise the existence of multiple goals, but
ensure that contradictory goals are minimised</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">We believe that this proposal achieves each of
these policy objectives.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The specific goals of this proposal are to
simultaneously reduce the size and profits of the illicit drug
market by the greatest amount; and provide the greatest level of
harm reduction for users of currently illicit drugs; and minimise
the number of users of these drugs who experience problems
related to their drug use</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Defining Harm Reduction</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">We use the term &quot;harm reduction&quot; to
mean: </font></p>

<p><font size="2">A policy or programme directed towards reducing
the adverse health, social and economic consequences of drug use
to the community and to the individual user, even though the user
may continue to use psychoactive drugs at this time.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Harm reduction policies and programmes must be
part of a public health approach to managing drug use. Protecting
the health of the community must include protecting the health of
drug users.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Principles of Controlled Availability</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">Applying these policy goals under the above
definition of harm reduction, we propose that a system of
controlled availability of currently illicit drugs be introduced.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Such a system should have the following
principles as its key elements:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">1. The use and possession of currently illicit
drugs should be made legal, in an environment of controlled
availability. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">2. The regulated manufacture, supply and sale
of selected drugs should be allowed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">3. The drugs selected for controlled
availability should include cannabis, heroin, amphetamine,
ecstasy and anabolic steroids.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">4. The drugs selected for should be made
available either:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">a) Over the counter from licensed premises in
specified (generally low) dosages of known purity, clearly
labelled with ingredients shown; or</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">b) By prescription.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">5. The age limit for the regulated supply of
currently illicit drugs should be the same as it is for alcohol.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">6. Advertising and marketing should be the
minimum necessary (eg, for brand identification) to ensure that
non-users are not attracted into drug use by marketing.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">7. Prices of regulated drugs should be set so
that least harmful forms of the drug (usually lower dosages) are
substantially less costly than more harmful forms of the drug.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">8. Users must demonstrate adequate knowledge
about the effects of the drug they intend to purchase, and about
safe usage.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">9. Profits earned from the commercial
production or supply of drugs should be taxed. Revenues obtained
from taxes and licence fees must be applied (in whole or in large
part) to education, and to treatment for those drug users who
want it. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">10. Controlled availability should operate in a
framework of:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">a) education in which doctors and other health
professionals, licensed drug sellers and drug users all
participate in baseline and follow-up education based on valid
research; and</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">b) widespread, easily accessible treatment for
drug-related problems, with funding to be provided to a wide
variety of non-coercive options for positive change.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">11. The prescription system should have the
following characteristics:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">a) Appropriate criteria for a drug to be
prescribed to an individual would be: </font></p>

<p><font size="2">i. regular frequent use (usually daily);</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">ii. clear evidence of dependence;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">iii. continued use having a severe effect on
lifestyle;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">iv. the harms associated with non-prescribed
use being significantly greater than those associated with
prescription. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">b) A variety of forms for oral, smokable or
injectable use be made available, in a range of doses up to a
negotiated maximum dose. Users must also have access to
appropriate drug using equipment.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">C) Users of the prescription system be
registered. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">d) The prescription system would operate in a
framework of:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">i. Harm reduction and full consumer
participation.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">ii. Entry assessment to ensure that the
individual wants to be maintained on the drug: this assessment
must be carried out by a trained, qualified drugs worker and must
include a full and frank discussion of the likely consequences of
a range of options including maintenance, detoxification,
selective detoxification, and controlled using.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">iii. Options for dispensing which may include:</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Pharmacy dispensing</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Drug clinic dispensing</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Home delivery or mobile van for long-term
illness, palliative care or isolated individuals</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Safe injecting spaces (&quot;shooting
rooms&quot;) in areas with a high concentration of drug
injectors, especially those who are homeless.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">iv. Reasonable cost to the consumer. Services
to clients on low incomes would be delivered through the public
health system.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>PART B: CASE STUDIES</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">In this Part we propose some concrete examples
of how these Principles might be applied for particular drugs.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">We do not suggest that the proposals in this
Part describe the only possible application of these principles.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Cannabis</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">We use the term &quot;cannabis&quot; to refer
to the complete range of cannabis products including marijuana,
hashish resin and oil, and other preparations, as well as
industrial hemp. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">It would be legal to grow up to 10 cannabis
plants for personal use. It would be legal to consume cannabis
products or to possess up to 50 grams (dry weight) of cannabis
for personal use. It would be legal to supply in small quantities
(up to 50 grams) to people aged 18 and over for no payment.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">It would be legal to grow larger quantities of
cannabis under licence to a State Government Office of Drug
Revenue (ODR). Officially sanctioned cannabis growers would be
allowed to sell their products to cannabis shops or Kafes, or to
manufacturers of other cannabis products such as biscuits and
cakes, rope, paper, textiles, etc. A regulation system would
ensure that grades of cannabis (principally by THC content) are
adhered to, providing quality assurance for end users. A
differential tax could operate with different grades being
subject to different tax.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">A system of cannabis Kafes would be established
for retail sales of cannabis, both for consumption on the
premises and for take-away consumption to people aged 18 and
over. A range of cannabis products from rolled cigarettes to
biscuits might be available, together with smoking implements
designed to reduce the level of harm associated with smoking
cannabis products (eg bongs).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Other retailers (eg tobacconists) would be
licensed to sell take away cannabis products. Cannabis seeds, and
information about home cultivation, would also be available.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Commercial cannabis suppliers would be required
to label their products with consumer information concerning
weight, THC content, recommended dosage, and approved health
warnings. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Profits earned from the commercial manufacture
or supply of cannabis would be taxed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Prices for cannabis products should be
comparable with prices of alcoholic spirits. Prices should be set
to encourage users to eat cannabis products rather than smoke.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Sales to people under 18 and unlicensed (ie
untaxed) sales would be illegal.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Advertising and marketing of cannabis products
would be restricted to the minimum necessary (eg for brand
identification). It might include a statement outside and inside
Kafes that &quot;cannabis products are sold here&quot;, or
perhaps a discrete symbol indicating availability of cannabis
products.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Cannabis smoking would be banned in places
where tobacco smoking is banned.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">A realistic education campaign about the
hazards of using cannabis, concentrating on safe cannabis use,
&quot;dope-driving&quot;, the effects of both shortterm and
chronic use, and the use of cannabis and alcohol together, would
be carried out at regular intervals. The cost of this campaign
and ongoing campaigns directed at school students, homeless and
working youth and visitors to the State would be paid for by tax
revenues from cannabis sales. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Revenues from taxes and licence fees would be
used to administer the regulatory system and to provide education
and treatment services through services funded by the Health
Department. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain an offence to drive while under
the influence of cannabis, unless further research proves that
cannabis does not impair driving ability. Research should be
conducted to determine what (if any) level of cannabis
intoxication would not adversely affects drivers' ability.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain illegal to import or export
cannabis. </font></p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Heroin &amp; other opioids</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">In this section, we refer to heroin and other
currently illicit opioids such as opium, as well as currently
restricted drugs such as methadone.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would be legal to use heroin and all
currently illicit opioid products, and to possess small
quantities (2 grams) for personal use.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain illegal to supply, manufacture
or traffic in currently illicit opioid drugs except as follows:</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Opiated teas, tinctures, tonics and other
products, clearly showing the percentage of opioid per volume
would be manufactured under licence to a State Government Office
of Drug Revenue (ODR) and sold through pharmacies to people over
the age of 18. All ingredients of these products would be listed
on their packaging. Taxes raise from the sale of these products
would be used to fund treatment and education programs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Smokable opium and heroin would be manufactured
under licence to the ODR and sold in pharmacies to people over
the age of 18, together with smoking implements designed to
reduce the level of harm associated with opium and heroin smoking
(ie. smoke cooling equipment such as hookahs and long pipes).
Prices of these products would be set so that they would:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">(a) encourage opium use over heroin use, but
which</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">(b) encourage opioid smoking over opioid
injecting. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Sales of these products would be in small
quantities only (enough for 3-4 episodes of intoxication). Taxes
raised from sales would be used to fund treatment and education
programs, and to subsidise the prescription system.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">By prescription (see below).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The pharmacy sales of opiated products, opium
and heroin would be regulated by officers of the ODR, not by the
police. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The retail system would be accompanied by an
education, information and referral system. A general education
campaign would be carried out to provide the rationale for this
system and to explain its workings.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Commercial suppliers would be required to label
their products with consumer information concerning weight,
recommended dosage, and approved health warnings.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Profits earned from the commercial manufacture
or supply of heroin and other opioids would be taxed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">There would be no advertising or marketing of
opioid products except for the minimum necessary for brand
identification. Realistic education materials would be available
in a range of formats to opioid product buyers.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Training would also be provided to pharmacists
in early identification of opiate-related problems, assessment of
these problems, and referral for assistance via prescribed
opioids, drug treatment or other help as negotiated with the
consumer. Part of this training would be in obtaining information
from new buyers about their level of knowledge of opioid use, and
ensuring that new buyers especially have access to appropriate
education materials.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain an offence to drive while under
the influence of heroin or other opioids.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Prescription</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">The prescribing system should be established
for registered &quot;dependents&quot; (people who are or believe
that they are dependent on a drug). Such a prescription system
would have the following as its essential elements:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The system should have as its core values harm
reduction and full consumer participation. The system should have
an entry assessment to ensure that the individual wants to be
maintained on an opioid drug. Assessment must be carried out by a
trained, qualified drugs worker. A full and frank assessment of
the likely consequences of a range of options including
maintenance, detoxification, selective detoxification, controlled
using, etc should be negotiated with the individual.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The prescription system should make available a
choice of the five most popular opioid drugs in a variety of
forms for oral or injectable use, in a range of doses up to a
negotiated maximum dose when they so desire.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">To avoid &quot;double&quot; prescribing, a
computerised register would be kept of the dependent person's
name, address, preferred drug(s) and maximum dose(s).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Options for dispensing should also be
negotiated. They may include: Pharmacy dispensing Drug clinic
dispensing Home delivery for long-term illness or palliative
care. Safe injecting spaces (&quot;shooting rooms&quot;) in areas
with a high concentration of drug injectors, especially those who
are homeless.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The system should be costed at a reasonable fee
to the consumer. Services to clients on low incomes should be
delivered through the public health system. Operating costs will
be supplemented by some of the revenues from the ODR.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain illegal to import or export
heroin and opioids.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Amphetamine</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">It would be legal to consume amphetamine and to
possess small quantities (2 grams) for personal use.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain illegal to manufacture, supply
or traffic in currently amphetamine except as follows:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Amphetamine would be manufactured under licence
to a State Government Office of Drug Revenue (ODR) and sold in
pharmacies to people over the age of 18. Prices of these products
would be set so that they are much higher than cannabis products.
Sales of amphetamine would be in small quantities only (enough
for 3-4 episodes of intoxication). Taxes on sales would be used
to fund treatment and education programs and to subsidise that
prescription program.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">By prescription.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The pharmacy sales of amphetamine would be
regulated by officers of the ODR, not by the police.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The retail system would be accompanied by an
education, information and referral system. A general education
campaign would be carried out to provide the rationale for this
system and to explain its workings.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Profits earned from the commercial manufacture
or supply of amphetamine would be taxed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Realistic education materials would be
available in a range of formats to amphetamine buyers.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">There would be no advertising or marketing of
amphetamine except for strictly limited brand identification.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Commercial suppliers would be required to label
their products with consumer information concerning weight,
recommended dosage, and approved health warnings.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain illegal to import or export
amphetamine. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain an offence to drive while under
the influence of amphetamine.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Training would also be provided to pharmacists
in early identification of amphetamine-related problems,
assessment of these problems, and referral for assistance via
prescribed amphetamine, drug treatment or other help as
negotiated with the consumer. Part of this training would be in
obtaining information from new buyers about their level of
knowledge of stimulant use, and ensuring that new buyers
especially have access to appropriate education materials.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">The prescription system should be established
for registered &quot;dependents&quot; (people who are or who
believe they are dependent on a drug). Such a system should have
the same essential elements as the opioid prescribing system
described above.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Ecstasy</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">It would be legal to consume ecstasy and to
possess up to 2 grams or 10 tablets.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Ecstasy may be manufactured and sold under
licence in pharmacies to people over the age of 18. Licences to
manufacturers, distributors and pharmacists would be issued by a
State Government Office of Drug Revenue (ODR).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Pharmacists licensed to sell ecstasy would be
required to complete suitable training in the pharmacological
effects of MDMA. Part of this training would in obtaining
information from new buyers about their level of knowledge of
ecstasy use, and ensuring that new buyers especially have access
to appropriate education materials.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Commercial suppliers would be required to label
their products with consumer information concerning ingredients,
recommended dosage, and approved health warnings. Ecstasy should
be manufactured for sale in standardised doses.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Profits earned from the commercial manufacture
or supply of ecstasy would be taxed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Rave parties would be allowed subject to
promoters obtaining a licence. To qualify for a licence,
promoters must demonstrate that arrangements have been made to
provide adequate supplies of free water, chill out rooms, and
other appropriate health measures. [If a significant black market
persists, it may be necessary to have a pharmacologist on-site to
analyse tablets and powders on the request of patrons.]</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Health information should be made available in
appropriate formats at places where ecstasy use is predictable
(eg raves). This information would include advice to drink
adequate water and to rest and cool down regularly.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain an offence to drive while under
the influence of ecstasy.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain illegal to import or export
ecstasy.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Anabolic Steroids</strong></font><strong>

<p><font size="2">Steroids represent a separate and different
phenomenon of drug use to traditional psychoactive drugs. The
relationship between effect desired and effect obtained is
specific, and has less to do with the social and environmental
context of drug use. A harm reduction approach to steroid use
would include medical supervision of training and diet, as well
as psychological and physical monitoring (such as testing for
liver and kidney function). </font></p>

<p><font size="2">It would be legal to use or possess small
quantities of anabolic steroids, provided the user holds a
current prescription from a medical practitioner authorising
their use.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Prescriptions may be issued for a maximum
single period of one month. Prescriptions could be renewed only
after consultation with the prescriber.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Training in the physical and psychological
effects of steroid use would be provided to those medical
practitioners who wish to be steroid prescribers.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Commercial suppliers would be required to label
their products with consumer information concerning ingredients,
recommended dosage, and approved health warnings.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Education campaigns should be undertaken aimed
at encouraging steroid users to moderate the quantities and
dosages used, and to use steroids only under medical supervision.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Research should continue into the physical and
psychological effects of use of anabolic steroids, especially
long term use. The results of this research should be promoted
widely among steroid users.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Sporting organisations would be able to
continue to ban steroid users from competition, and to test
competitors for steroid use.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain illegal to import or export
anabolic steroids.</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Report of the Redfern Legal Centre Drug
Law Reform Project</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">September 1996</font> </p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>5 Comments on the Harm Reduction Model</strong></font><font
size="5"><strong> </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Respondents were asked to comment in broad
terms about the desirability of controlled availability, and
about the Principles for Controlled Availability outlined in the
paper. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Responses were received from the same group
under the same conditions outlined in Chapter 3.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>General remarks</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">General comments on the Model included:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;I would argue that we need to examine
specific regulatory options in terms of their potential for harm
minimisation and, in particular, to assess the relationship
between drug-related harm and particular forms of markets and
systems of distribution. As Nicholas Dorn and Nigel South have
recently suggested in the UK context, we need to ask: 'What sort
of markets do we least dislike, and how can we adjust the control
mix so as to push markets in the least undesired (harmful)
direction.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Some of the specific goals proposed for
rational drug policy have still to be tested. The means of
implementing controls on age, advertising and marketing, and
adequate knowledge about safe use are unknown. There should
certainly be a framework of treatment for drug related problems.
The prescription system is untested, as is the assessment
process.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;I wish to endorse (the Model's) contents,
especially the point that prohibition has had no positive
results. I am not competent to suggest any amendments except to
add that I was a registered nurse for about thirty-five
years.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Unfortunately, the (Model) goes much
further than the harm minimisation principles of the National
Drug Strategy, to the point of having few controls on
availability at all.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;In general, harm reduction strategies
presuppose the impossibility of addressing the undesirable
behaviour and hence direct attention to the consequences. What is
not clear, in my mind, is how we define the I undesirable
behaviour' with which we are dealing. In other words, is drug use
a cause or result of other social or behavioural problems?&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Controlled availability</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">Should we adopt a &quot;controlled
availability&quot; approach in the long term as the best policy
direction for currently illicit drugs?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Fourteen were in favour of the concept of
controlled availability as outlined in the paper, six were
against.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Supported, because it's sensible.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;(Controlled availability) is needed as
the next step in harm minimisation.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;We need education about drug effects, and
research too. Controlled availability provides a means both of
generating data and of informing users.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Sends the wrong message to young
people.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Supported, provided that: it is
researched for each drug group research is open and rigorous only
move to next group if research is favourable&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Controlled availability as defined seems
more like 'uncontrolled availability' when over-the-counter
options are included. All drugs with a medical purpose that can
help people with an addiction problem should be available on
prescription, but not over-the-counter.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Can't answer for all drugs at this stage.
Support idea for cannabis.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;I am unconvinced as to the merits of a
'blanket' approach to controlled availability. More convinced as
to the merits of controlled availability of cannabis, perhaps
ecstasy, and favour prescribing system for heroin.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Internal consistency</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">Is the Harm Reduction Model of Controlled Drug
Availability internally coherent? For example, are the principles
consistent with the stated goals?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Seventeen said yes, four said no.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Good effort in putting all this together
... the way you've done it contains a lot of common sense.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;I don't think the mechanisms of
controlled availability have been spelt out in enough detail to
make a judgment about harm minimisation for all drugs.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;They're the best considered proposals
I've yet seen coming from an Australian source ... May these
proposals enjoy wide readership.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Raises all the right questions which need
to be addressed. The current system needs to be challenged.&quot;
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;The document could be strengthened by
describing the pros and cons of each method of delivery (Eg,
prescription and over the counter).&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Principles</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">Do you broadly support the Principles of
Controlled Availability set out in the Harm Reduction Model of
rug Availability? </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Eighteen were in favour, five were opposed.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;The closest to the mark we've seen so
far.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;It is this kind of extremism that offers
opponents of harm minimisation strategies a platform from which
to jump.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;You should be congratulated for doing the
exercise. By being specific about details, you give everybody a
chance to tear it apart. But that is positive.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;We congratulate the Drug Law Reform
Project on the production of such a positive and practical Model,
one that if fully and successfully implemented by governments and
other decision makers, would most certainly contribute to a
substantial reduction of hepatitis C transmission. We look
forward to hearing of progress on its implementation.&quot;</font>

<p><font size="4">6. Future drug law reform activities</font><font
size="5"> </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Future -activities for the Redfern Drug Law
Reform Project are -likely to include closer links to other
committees and organisations working on drug law reform in New
South Wales. These groups are growing in number and diversity and
include in their members the parents, siblings and friends of
people who have died from overdose, AIDS or other drug-related
causes, doctors, lawyers, professors and emeritus professors of
medicine and pharmacology, drug users, health care workers,
clerks, needle exchange workers, historians and artists.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In turn, these NSW groups are working closely
with groups in other States and with the Australian Drug Law
Reform Foundation to address issues of drug policy and related
law reform in every jurisdiction in Australia. The documents
contained in this report will be examined again next year to see
whether further changes and refinements are needed. Another
report of people's comments on the documents will also be
released at some point in 1997. </font></p>

<p><b>LaGuardia Committee Report on Marihuana</b> </p>

<h1>Comparison Between Users and Non-Users from the Standpoint of
Mental and Physical Deterioration </h1>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A careful testing of the motor and sensory functions of the
nervous system was included in the general physical examination
of each subject. Of motor functions, reflex activity and muscular
response and coordination were determined; of sensory functions,
perception of touch, pain and temperature stimuli; of specialized
functions, taste, hearing and vision. In the eye, the corneal and
light reflexes were tested and a retinal examination was made. In
this neurological examination no pathological conditions were
found in any of the subjects. </p>

<p>In the psychiatric examination attention was paid to general
intelligence and knowledge in relation to the subject's
background, to relevancy of talk in conversation, to orientation
as to time, place and situation, to memory of past and recent
events, to ability in simple arithmetic, to judgment in reaching
decisions, and to the presence of abnormal mental content shown
by delusions, hallucinations, obsessions, and ideas of
persecution. There was no evidence of disordered cerebral
functioning in any of the group. </p>

<p>As would be expected, differences in grades of intelligence
and in orderliness in thinking and reasoning were noticeable. The
Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test was administered to a total of
60 male subjects, 40 marihuana users and 20 nonusers. The average
I.Q. for the user group was 96.7, range 70 to 124, and for the
non-user group the average I.Q. was 104.5, range 93 to 114. Both
groups may therefore be classified as of average intelligence. </p>

<p>When analyzed according to racial distribution the two groups
were even better equated intellectually than the total results
indicate. For the 28 white subjects examined (13 users and 15
non-users) the average I.Q. for the users was 106.1 range 77 to
124, and for the non-users the average I.Q. was 106.3, range 96
to 114. There were 24 Negro subjects, 19 users and 5 non-users.
The average I.Q. for the users was 92.6, range 70 to 112, while
for the non-users the average I.Q. was 98.8, range 93 to 101.
Although the non-users averaged 6.2 points higher than the users,
it must be taken into account that the number of Negro non-users
tested was small. In any event, the disparity in results would
not be considered significant.. The average I.Q. of the 2 Puerto
Rican users was 91.0, range 72 to 100. </p>

<p>Reports on mental deterioration due to toxic, organic or
psychotic factors as given in the literature reveal that in such
cases the individual scores on the Bellevue Adult Intelligence
Test show marked irregularity, depending upon the functions
involved in the deteriorative process. As a group, the marihuana
users tested in this study showed very even functioning, and what
little irregularity occurred can be explained on the basis of
language and racial factors. </p>

<p>The physical and psychiatric examinations were of a
qualitative rather than a quantitative nature. In the special
examinations and tests of organ and system function, quantitative
measurements were obtained for 17 marihuana users. These subjects
were selected for the reason that they had smoked marihuana for
the longest period of time. The figures for years of usage and
number of cigarettes smoked daily were taken from each subject's
statement. </p>

<p>Marihuana users accustomed to daily smoking for a period of
from two and a half to sixteen years showed no abnormal system
functioning which would differentiate them from the non-users. </p>

<p>There is definite evidence in this study that the marihuana
users were not inferior in intelligence to the general population
and that they had suffered no mental or physical deterioration as
a result of their use of the drug. Addiction and Tolerance </p>

<p>A drug addiction is characterized by a compelling urge to use
the drug for the prevention or relief of distressing mental and
physical disturbances which occur when the necessary dose is
delayed or omitted. A drug habit is also characterized by an urge
to use the drug, but this is not compelling. The abstinence
symptoms, which are expressions of nervous states, are not
particularly distressing and do not occur as long as the person's
attention is placed on other matters. </p>

<p>Drug tolerance in the narrower sense used here means that
larger doses than those originally used are required to bring
about the effects desired by the subject. In the case of
morphine, tolerance develops because of addiction, but in other
instances tolerance may be present without addiction and
addiction without tolerance. When both are present the matter
takes on greater importance because of the extremes to which the
addict goes to obtain the drug constantly and in increasing
quantities. </p>

<p>As our group of subjects included 48 users of marihuana,
opportunity was afforded for some conclusions concerning
marihuana addiction and tolerance. Practically all of our group
of users stated that they could and often did voluntarily stop
the smoking for a time without any undue disturbance from the
deprivation. In the sociologic study reported by Dr. Schoenfeld
it was found that smokers had no compelling urge for marihuana.
If &quot;reefers&quot; were not readily available there was no
special effort made to obtain them from known sources of supply.
Dr. Walter Bromberg, Psychiatrist-in-Charge, Psychiatric Clinic,
Court of General Sessions in New York, states: &quot;The fact
that offenders brought up on marihuana charges do not request
medical treatment on their incarceration (with its cessation of
drug supply) argues for the absence of with drawal symptoms.''(1)
From interviews with several hundred marihuana users he concludes
that true addiction was absent. </p>

<p>(1) Bromberg, W. &quot;Marihuana: a psychiatric study.&quot;
J.A.MA. 113:4, 1939.=20 </p>

<p>The evidence submitted here warrants the conclusion that as
far as New York City is concerned true addiction to marihuana
does not occur. </p>

<p>The evidence concerning acquired tolerance is less clear-cut
Tolerance develops during the periods when the drug is being
taken and accounts for the necessity of increasing the dosage to
bring about the desired effects. How long the tolerance persists
after the drug administration is stopped has not been definitely
established in any instance. </p>

<p>The statements of marihuana usage and time since stoppage
given by eight of our subjects are summarized in Table 26. (TABLE
26) </p>

<p>On one or more of the numerous occasions on which marihuana
was administered each of these subjects received what was
considered a minimal effective dose. One (J.B.) was given 1 cc.,
another (A.B.) 3 cc., the others 2 cc. In all instances the
customary physical effects, conjunctival injection, dilated and
sluggishly reacting pupils, tremors and ataxia, were observed.
With these doses the subjects also experienced the sensation
described as &quot;high.&quot; The only conclusion warranted here
is that if acquired tolerance does occur it persists for a
limited period only. </p>

<p>Further evidence, though indirect, was brought out by Dr.
Shoenfeld's investigation and by personal interviews with our 48
users. There is agreement in the statements that among users the
smoking of one or two cigarettes is sufficient to bring on the
effect known as &quot;high.&quot; When this state is reached the
user will not continue smoking for fear of becoming &quot;too
high.&quot; When the desired effects have passed off and the
smoker has &quot;come down,&quot; smoking one cigarette brings
the &quot;high&quot; effect on again. This could not be the case
had a steadily increasing tolerance developed. </p>

<p>The evidence available then=AD-the absence of any compelling
urge to use the drug, the absence of any distressing abstinence
symptoms, the statements that no increase in dosage is required
to repeat the desired effect in users-=ADjustifies the conclusion
that neither true addiction nor tolerance is found in marihuana
users. The continuation and the frequency of usage of marihuana,
as in the case of many other habit-forming substances, depend on
the easily controlled desires for its pleasurable effects.
Possible Therapeutic Applications </p>

<p>If a drug has well-marked pharmacological actions and low
toxicity, as appears to be the case with marihuana, a
consideration of special interest is its possible therapeutic
application. In the older clinical literature marihuana was
recommended for use in a wide variety of disorders, but in recent
years it has almost disappeared from the materia medica and it
was dropped from the United States Pharmacopeia twenty years ago.
</p>

<p>In view of the laboratory and clinical findings obtained in
this study the question of the therapeutic possibilities of the
drug was considered. Marihuana possesses two qualities which
suggest that it might have useful actions in man. The first is
the typical euphoria- producing action which might be applicable
in the treatment of various types of mental depression- the
second is the rather unique property which results in the
stimulation of appetite. In the light of this evidence and in
view of the fact that there is a lack of any substantial
indication of dependence on the drug, it was reasoned that
marihuana might be useful in alleviating the withdrawal symptoms
in drug addicts. </p>

<p>At the Riker's Island Penitentiary observations were made on
56 inmates who were addicted to morphine or heroin. Two groups
were selected, the addicts in each being matched with those in
the other group as to age, physical condition, duration and
intensity of habit, and number of previous attempts at cure. The
subjects in one group received no treatment or were given
Magendie's solution according to the usual hospital regimen while
those in the other group were treated with 15 mg. of
tetrahydrocannabinol three times daily with or without placebo
(subcutaneous water injection). An attempt was made to evaluate
the severity of the withdrawal signs and symptoms. The impression
was gained that those who received tetrahydrocannabinol had less
severe withdrawal symptoms and left the hospital at the end of
the treatment period in better condition than those who received
no treatment or who were treated with Magendie's solution. The
ones in the former group maintained their appetite and in some
cases actually gained weight during the withdrawal period. </p>

<p>Since psychological factors play a large part in the
withdrawal symptoms of at least a certain proportion of morphine
addicts, there are grounds for the assumption that a drug having
the properties of marihuana might be of aid in alleviating mental
distress during the withdrawal period. However, the studies here
described were not sufficiently complete to establish the value
of such treatment, and before conclusions can be drawn the
problem must be investigated under completely controlled
conditions. PHARMACOLOGICAL STUDY (1) S. Loewe, MD (2) (1) From
the Department of Pharrnacology, CorneU University Medical
College. (2) Part of the experimental work here reported was
conducted in collaboration with W. Modell SUMMARY </p>

<p>1. This review of the pharmacology of marihuana is centered
around the chemical and pharmacological identification of the
active principles of hemp. Coordination of chemical and
pharmacological investigations as a prerequisite to success in
the search for unknown principles and of the analysis of the
structure-activity relationship of these compounds is discussed. </p>

<p>2. In a survey of the sources of preparations with marihuana
activity, hemp seeds are disclosed as a heretofore unknown source
of active substances. </p>

<p>3. Varieties of hemp can be distinguished according to
genotypic differences of the content of active principles which
persist over generations independently of soil and climate. </p>

<p>4. The pharmacological actions of marihuana are analyzed with
regard to their specificity and their usefulness as indicators of
specific components. </p>

<p>5. Sixty-five substances from the new class of cannabinols and
related classes are reviewed, among which are the essential
components of the marihuana-active hemp oils. The discovery of
this class, the synthesis of these representatives, and their
structural elucidation led the way to the discovery of the active
substances. </p>

<p>6. Quantitative assay procedures are described for the most
important marihuana effects that are observed in the animal
experiment. The assay of the ataxia effect in the dog and of the
synergistic hypnotic effect in the mouse with refined procedures
are shown to be reliable expedients for measuring these two
marihuana actions, whereas the areflexia effect in rabbits failed
to show the reproducibility required for quantitative purposes. </p>

<p>7. With the aid of these methods the natural
tetrahydrocannabinols are shown to be active principles
responsible for ataxia in dogs and psychic action in man. They
are intermediate products between the two ineffective substances
which compose the bulk of hemp oil: a labile excretion product of
the plant, cannabidiol, and a stable end- product, cannabinol.
The conversion of cannabidol into active tetrahydrocannabinol by
a natural environmental influence has been paralleled by
ultraviolet irradiation in vitro. </p>

<p>8. Numerous isomers, homologs and analogs of tetra- and
hexahydrocannabinol are shown to possess the specific marihuana
action. The potency varies enormously and is highest in natural,
optically active=ADlaevogyrous=ADtetrahydrocannabinols. </p>

<p>9. The significance of many of the structural details of the
tetrahydrocannabinol molecule for marihuana activity is
elucidated by quantitative determinations of relative potency.
Special attention was devoted to a study of the importance of
variations in the length of the 3- alkyl side chain of
tetrahydrocannabinols. In studying methyl to nonyl homologs of
the original amyl derivative occurring in nature, it was found
that the maximum potency is not at the amyl, but at the hexyl
homolog, and in two out of four homologous series at the
representatives with still longer side chains. </p>

<p>10. In addition to the ataxia and the psychic action, other
pharmacological attributes of the tetrahydrocannabinols are a
decrease in the respiratory and an increase in the pulse rates in
the non-narcotized dog. </p>

<p>11. The synergistic hypnotic action of marihuana in the mouse
is to be attributed to the otherwise inert cannabidiol. </p>

<p>12. The corneal areflexia action in the rabbit was much
stronger in impure distillate oils than in pure tetrahydrocan
nabinols, which leads to the conclusion that this action is
either poorly reproducible or must be attributed to a different,
as yet unknown, principle. </p>

<p>13. Only one among the numerous cannabinol derivatives, 7-
methyltetrahydrocannabinol, was found to produce a motor
stimulant=AD-convulsant=AD-action concomitant with ataxia action.
A cannabidiol derivative, tetrahydrocannabidiol, was found to
have specific convulsant action in the dog. </p>

<ol>
    <li>A central stimulant (benzedrine) considerably increased
        the ataxia action of marihuana, whereas a hypnotic
        (amytal) had no influence. </li>
</ol>

<h1>Legislative Options for Cannabis Use in Australia </h1>

<h1>Executive summary<br>
</h1>

<p><img src="../../../Graphics/blueline.GIF" width="562"

</p>

<h2><a href="can_ch1.htm">Chapter 1: Introduction</a> </h2>

<p>This paper is concerned with the legislative options available
for cannabis, and the impact of those options on the community at
large and on the law enforcement sector. It has been prepared by
the Australian Institute of Criminology at the request of the
National Task Force on Cannabis; the Task Force plans to use this
paper in developing its recommendations to the National Drug
Strategy Committee. This paper, along with other commissioned
Task Force papers, may in future be used to inform the
development of a national policy on cannabis. </p>

<h2><a href="can_ch2.htm">Chapter 2: Policy goals</a> </h2>

<p>Given the importance which is assigned to setting clear goals
for any major social policy, it is surprising how infrequently
discussion of drug policy is preceded by a precise specification
of what the policy is intended to achieve. Too often, goals are
either global (e.g. to reduce drug use) or unattainable (e.g. to
eliminate drug use), and as such they allow for many
interpretations. Similarly, goals are often stated in such a way
that they could be achieved through a number of quite
contradictory strategies and at vastly differing costs. </p>

<p>This report starts from the proposition that it is important
to know what are the requirements for rational drug policy in
general, and what are the objectives of cannabis policy
specifically. In this context, it is important to address the
issue of drug policy, as well as drug legislation. The link
between policy, legislation and implementation is important and
must be factored into these considerations. The development of
policy and legislation relating to cannabis should take into
account the following issues: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Arguments that apply to the most appropriate control
        regime for one drug need not &quot; and often do
        not&quot; apply to others. <br>
    </li>
    <li>Drug policy should be crafted to take account of the
        different patterns and types of harms caused by specific
        drugs.<br>
    </li>
    <li>The details of control regimes are crucial determinants
        of their outcomes. Such details should not be left
        undefined. <br>
    </li>
    <li>Any analysis of control regimes should attempt to
        estimate their effects on both consumption levels and
        patterns of use. <br>
    </li>
    <li>Control regimes should not be considered in isolation
        from the problems of implementation and enforcement. <br>
    </li>
    <li>Arguments about the consequences of drug use should be
        separated from arguments about morals.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Options should be evaluated on the basis of evidence of
        damage. <br>
    </li>
    <li>Any policy should recognise the changing nature of the
        drug problem and be able to change with it. Additionally,
        all policies should be reviewed periodically to ensure
        that they are still relevant to current circumstances.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Policy should be made in the light of the costs of
        control as well as the benefits.<br>
    </li>
    <li>The goals of drug policy should be realistic.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Discussion of policy options should include a
        specification of which harms they are intended to reduce.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Discussion of cannabis policy (and drug policy generally)
        should recognise the existence of multiple and sometimes
        contradictory goals.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Policies to discourage cannabis use should be shown to be
        effective or be changed.<br>
    </li>
    <li>The harms caused by the control regimes themselves should
        not outweigh the harms prevented by them.<br>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>The application of these principles in a given situation
should lead to the development of explicit policy goals relating
to cannabis. It is likely that priorities will need to be
assigned between the available goals, as they are frequently
inconsistent. Nevertheless, the explicit specification of the
goals which policy and legislation are intended to achieve is
essential if they are to be properly articulated and evaluated. </p>

<h2><a href="can_ch3.htm">3. Cannabis in context: history, laws
and international treaties</a> </h2>

<p>Cannabis has been used for many thousands of years. It has
been used for the production of material products such as
clothing and rope; for its medicinal properties; and for its
psychoactive properties. Cannabis was used medicinally in
Australia until the mid-1960s and is currently used in many parts
of the world, in the form of hemp, for the production of cordage,
clothing, etc. </p>

<p>Australian drug laws, like those of many other countries,
closely followed the development of international drug treaties.
The influence of the United States of America in the conception
and development of treaties and related international instruments
has been enormous. The 1925 Geneva Convention on Opium and Other
Drugs was the first such convention to cover cannabis. The
Convention required the parties to limit the availability of
cannabis to medical and scientific purposes only. This remains
the status of cannabis in the international community. </p>

<p>Numerous enquires into drug use and trafficking have been
conducted both in Australia and overseas. Australian committees
have generally been very cautious about recommending changes to
the legal status of drugs. Nevertheless, a number of high level
Australian committees of inquiry have recommended the
liberalisation of legislation relating to cannabis, or at least
that such liberalisation be carefully considered. The most recent
of these at the national level was the Parliamentary Joint
Committee on the National Crime Authority which reported in 1989,
and at the State/Territory level, the Australian Capital
Territory Legislative Assembly's Select Committee on HIV, Illegal
Drugs and Prostitution, which reported in 1991. </p>

<p>In the main, cannabis was little known or used in Australia
until the 1960s. Nevertheless, the drugs legislation which was
introduced in most of the States and Territories towards the end
of the 1800s and early 1900s (primarily concerned with the
smoking of opium by Chinese people) provided a framework for the
prohibition of cannabis. The first Australian controls on
cannabis use were introduced in Victoria in 1928 legislation
which penalised the unauthorised use of Indian hemp and resin.
This was followed by corresponding legislation in the other
jurisdictions as the years passed. From the 1960s, however, the
Commonwealth has become increasingly involved in legislation
relating to cannabis (particularly with regard to its
importation). The penalties relating to cannabis cultivation,
possession and use were generally quite severe during the 1960s
and 1970s but have tended to lessen since then in most
jurisdictions, at least with regard to the minor offences of use
and possession of small quantities. </p>

<p>Perhaps the most significant recent legislative changes have
been the introduction in 1987 in South Australia and in 1992 in
the Australian Capital Territory of expiation notice schemes.
Under these schemes, a person found committing a minor offence
relating to cannabis is given what amounts to an
&quot;on-the-spot&quot; notice. If the prescribed penalty is paid
within the prescribed time then no court appearance is required
and no conviction is entered. If the person receiving the
expiation notice fails to respond to it, however, normal court
processes follow. </p>

<p>People considering the legal status of drugs and the
possibility of legislative change need to be cognisant of
Australia's international treaty obligations. Although some
difference of opinion exists with regard to the range of
legislative options for cannabis which are available to Australia
within the scope of the international treaties, it is clear that
the policy of total prohibition currently followed by most States
and Territories is only one of a number of options which are
available. </p>

<h2><a href="can_ch4.htm">Chapter 4: Five legislative options for
cannabis in Australia</a> </h2>

<p>Many legislative options are available for cannabis, and much
confusion exists in the terminology used to describe them. In our
view, the South Australian Royal Commission into the Non-Medical
Use of Drugs (the Sackville Commission) which reported in 1978
provided the most useful categorisation of these options. The
language used avoids the terms 'decriminalisation' and
'legalisation' as these expressions have quite different meanings
for different authorities. The five options discussed below
capture all the approaches which people have in mind when they
refer to 'decriminalisation' and 'legalisation', as well as other
options which these two words may or may not encompass. The
options are total prohibition (with and without an administrative
expediency principle), prohibition with civil penalties for minor
offences, partial prohibition, regulation and free availability. </p>

<p>Under the system of total prohibition the use, possession,
cultivation, importation, sale and distribution of any amount of
cannabis are treated as criminal offences. Total prohibition can
take a number of forms. In the United States, for example, the
eradication of all illicit drug use is a central aim of drug
policy and it is thought that total prohibition is the most
effective means of reaching this goal. Cannabis use is seen as
part of a larger drug problem and is dealt with as such. The
total prohibition policy, as implemented in the United States,
many other countries and most of the Australian States and
Territories, has clearly not achieved its intended goal of
substantially reducing cannabis consumption. This is despite an
increasing amount of resources directed towards achieving this
goal. Both the financial and social costs of law enforcement
under an active policy of total prohibition are high. The policy
fails to meet a number of the crucial criteria for good drugs
policy, enunciated above. Cannabis policy has not been separated
from that of other drugs; arguments about the consequences of
drug use have not been separated from arguments about morals; the
goals of the 'war on drugs' are unrealistic; it appears that the
harms caused by the control regimes outweigh the harms caused by
the drug itself. </p>

<p>The Netherlands provides an example of a quite different
application of the total prohibition policy from that observed in
the United States and elsewhere. In The Netherlands, legislation
makes a clear distinction between 'drugs presenting unacceptable
risks', on the one hand, and 'cannabis products', on the other.
In addition, a clause in The Netherlands Code of Criminal
Procedure, known as the 'Expediency Principle', states that the
Prosecution Office may decide whether or not to enforce certain
laws, to prosecute or to initiate criminal investigation on the
basis of whether or not such action would be 'in the public
interest'. Using this clause, the Minister of Justice issued
guidelines in 1976 for the enforcement of drug laws and the
investigation and prosecution of breaches of drug laws.
Essentially it is these guidelines, rather than the total
prohibition legislation, that determines drug policy in The
Netherlands. According to the guidelines, dealing, possessing or
producing small amounts of cannabis do not require police
investigation, arrest or prosecution. </p>

<p>A low priority is also given to the investigation and
prosecution of retail dealing in cannabis, and police are only
required to confront cannabis dealers when they advertise
publicly or conduct their business in a provocative manner. This
is part of a broader government policy of 'normalisation', under
which efforts are made not to marginalise drug users, but to
ensure that the harm related to their drug use is minimised and
that they are able to avail themselves of community services to
the optimum extent. Evaluative studies have shown that cannabis
use has not increased in The Netherlands since the liberalisation
of its policy relating to cannabis. Indeed, levels of cannabis
consumption are far lower than those of the United States, where
the total prohibition policy is rigorously enforced. The policy
of the separation of the drug markets (i.e. separating cannabis
from other drugs which can have more serious consequences) has
apparently been successful. In a number of ways The Netherlands'
drug policy meets many of the criteria for good drug policy
discussed above. </p>

<p>The second policy option is that of prohibition with civil
penalties. Under this option, the penalties for the possession
and cultivation of small amounts of cannabis for personal use are
dealt with by civil sanctions such as paying a monetary penalty,
rather than by criminal sanctions such as fines or imprisonment.
Criminal sanctions still apply to the possession, cultivation and
distribution of large quantities of cannabis. The South
Australian Cannabis Expiation Notice Scheme, introduced in 1987,
and the similar scheme introduced in the Australian Capital
Territory in 1992 are examples of this option in practice. </p>

<p>As mentioned above, under the South Australian and ACT
systems, minor cannabis offences such as the possession of small
quantities, cannabis consumption, or the cultivation of a small
number of plants are expiable offences, i.e. if the prescribed
penalty is paid within the specified period, the offender does
not have to appear in court and avoids a criminal conviction. If
the penalty is not paid then the normal court appearance and
possibility of conviction ensues. </p>

<p>The evaluations conducted to date indicate that the cannabis
expiation notice schemes go a long way towards achieving their
goals and meeting the criteria for effective drugs policy
discussed above. This option takes account of the different
patterns of use and harms relating to cannabis, compared with
other drugs. The policy and legislative development has been
accompanied by attention to the details of implementation, rather
than being expressed in general terms only. It reflects an
understanding of the patterns of harm associated with cannabis,
recognising that much of the harm relates to the patterns of
enforcement of cannabis legislation, rather than to the use of
the drug itself. The approach is realistic and the goals
attainable, focusing on minimising the negative impact on users
of cannabis-related involvement in the criminal justice system,
along with producing society-wide benefits in terms of lessening
the financial costs to the criminal justice system. </p>

<p>The major concern associated with this approach (at least in
South Australia where most experience has been gained) is that
there could be a social class differential in terms of the
application of the policy. In other words, people from lower
socioeconomic classes could be disproportionately represented
among those who fail to expiate the offence and, consequently,
obtain criminal records. This concern is balanced by the
observation that, at a society-wide level, it appears that the
patterns of cannabis consumption are similar in South Australia
and the ACT to those found in the other jurisdictions which
operate policies of total prohibition. </p>

<p>The third legislative option is partial prohibition. This is
an option which seeks to maintain controls on the production and
distribution of cannabis while at the same time avoiding the
costs of criminalising the use of the drug. Under partial
prohibition, it would remain an offence to grow or deal in
cannabis in commercial quantities. It would not be an offence to
use cannabis or to possess or grow it in quantities judged
appropriate for personal use. A number of variations are possible
within this broad outline. A small number of countries, for
example Spain, have followed this model. Other countries, such as
Italy, have made possession and use unlawful, but not criminally
punishable. In none of these cases does it seem that an increase
in cannabis use has resulted from the establishment of this
legislative approach. </p>

<p>The partial prohibition model attempts to use legal
restrictions to discourage cannabis use by concentrating on the
prohibition of the commercial cultivation and supply and on the
advertising of the availability of the product. At the same time,
the model attempts to minimise the personal and social costs of
the total prohibition policy by allowing the use and personal
possession of cannabis. It assumes, therefore, that the harms
associated with cannabis are sufficiently serious to justify some
level of restriction on its availability and that criminal
sanctions remain an appropriate instrument to achieve this
restriction. </p>

<p>Since this model has not been fully implemented and evaluated
in any country, no empirically based information is available as
to the likely outcomes of this model. Nevertheless, it is likely
that the main outcome would be to reduce the financial and social
costs of having personal possession and use a criminal offence.
The possibility of an increased level of use of cannabis, under
this model, has been suggested as a potential limitation on its
effectiveness. It appears, however, that this fear is unfounded
owing to such factors: as the limited role of deterrents in a
situation where only a low probability of detection occurs;
evidence that fear of arrest is not a significant factor in
people's decision not to use cannabis; and evidence that reducing
or eliminating penalties does not generally lead to any increase
in cannabis consumption. This option meets the criteria of
effective drugs policy to a greater extent than some of the other
options considered here. It separates cannabis from other
(potentially more harmful) drugs. It seeks to minimise the
negative impacts of enforcement regimes. It acknowledges the
contradiction between the goals of limiting cannabis use while
minimising the negative aspects of enforcement. Finally, its
goals are realistic and attainable. </p>

<p>The fourth legislative option is regulation. In this approach,
the production, distribution and the sale of cannabis would be
controlled to a greater or lesser extent by government agencies.
Trafficking outside the regulated system would continue to be a
criminal offence and attract penalties. Activities associated
with personal use, however, would not be penalised. While no full
working model of this option is available, cannabis control in
The Netherlands exhibits some elements of the regulatory option.
While the Dutch Government does not license production,
distribution or sale of cannabis, youth centres and coffee shops
selling hemp products operate openly under certain clearly
defined conditions. Examples of regulatory systems for drugs
other than cannabis exist within Australia. For instance, opium
poppies are cultivated under government licence in Tasmania. A
regulatory regime applies to the drugs tobacco, alcohol and many
pharmaceutical products. </p>

<p>The two major regulatory models for currently illicit drugs
are regulated commercial sale and government monopoly. The option
exists, within this broad approach, for a range of initiatives to
limit the attractiveness of cannabis, including setting high
prices through taxation and limiting the availability of the
product. The primary rationale for the regulatory option is the
recognition that the eradication of all cannabis use is an
unrealistic goal and that, since cannabis use will occur, it
should occur in the safest possible environment. It recognises
that the gateway theory of drug use (that cannabis users have an
increased likelihood of progression to more dangerous drugs as a
direct result of using cannabis) is not supported by empirical
evidence. </p>

<p>The outcomes of a regulatory policy would depend very much on
the regulatory framework established. To achieve its goals, the
regime would need to be structured in such a way as to remove the
incentives for the operation of a black market in cannabis. While
considerable financial and social costs could be avoided by the
operation of this policy, it could entail a complex system of
licensing and monitoring which could involve high administrative
costs. These implementation details would need to be clearly
worked out to attain a satisfactory balance. </p>

<p>A number of policy goals might be satisfied by a well-designed
regulatory system. These include the separation of drug markets,
a separation of arguments about the consequences of drug use from
arguments about morals, the adoption of a realistic approach to
drug use and a reduction in harm. Two important factors must,
however, be kept in mind. The first is the need to mould any
policy of regulation to fit the particular drug  in this case
cannabis. Secondly, regulatory policy must take into account not
only legislative frameworks but also appropriate measures of
social control, such as appropriate drug education and
prohibitions on advertising, so that the goals of reduction of
harm can continue to be pursued. </p>

<p>The final option discussed here is the free availability of
cannabis. Like the total prohibition option, this is an extreme
legislative option. Free availability would mean the absence of
any legislative or regulatory restrictions on the substance's
cultivation, importation, sale, supply by other means, possession
or use. This legislative option is not practised in any countries
at the moment but was the approach used in Australia until the
1920s. It must be noted, however, that very little cannabis use
occurred up to this time. </p>

<p>Although a strong lobby exists for the liberalisation of
cannabis legislation in Australia, few lobbyists advocate totally
free availability. Perhaps for pragmatic reasons, at least some
form of regulation is generally deemed acceptable. This reflects
concerns about the quality of cannabis (e.g. the presence of
health-impairing pesticide residues), driving or operating
machinery while intoxicated by the drug, its use by children,
etc. Those who advocate totally free availability do so on the
basis of an extreme libertarian position. </p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine the free availability option ever
being fully implemented, particularly in Australia. To do so
would require governments to abrogate all responsibility in the
area of consumer protection, to forego taxation revenue and to
take no action to protect particularly vulnerable groups. </p>

<p>Considering the position of other drugs in Australian society,
it is difficult to maintain an argument for the free availability
legislative option. This is because governments have both the
right and the responsibility to act to mitigate sources of harm
to society. The culture shift in most Western nations to minimise
the harm caused by currently licit drugs, especially tobacco and
alcohol, means that the free availability of cannabis is not a
viable contemporary option. </p>

<h2><a href="can_ch5.htm">Chapter 5: Diversion and compulsory
treatment</a> </h2>

<p>The terms of reference for this study include a review of
diversion and compulsory treatment as they relate to cannabis
users. Diversion of cannabis users can take a number of forms,
including pre-arrest diversion, pre-court diversion, pre-sentence
diversion or post-conviction diversion. Compulsory treatment may
or may not be a feature of diversionary process, that is,
compulsory treatment is sometimes mandated as a condition of the
diversion of an offender or an alleged offender from the criminal
justice system, but sometimes operates independently of that
system. </p>

<p>Pre-arrest diversion is essentially the discretion exercised
by police at the point of contact with an alleged offender. In
addition to this form of diversion, a variety of more or less
formal diversionary programs are in place in Australia and
overseas. As indicated above, they operate at a range of points
in the processing of alleged and convicted offenders and take a
wide variety of forms. In the Australian Capital Territory, for
example, legislation provides, as a sentencing option, that
anyone found guilty of an offence may being sent for assessment
as to whether the person is drug dependent and suitable for
referral to treatment. In these instances, an offender may be
referred to a treatment assessment panel consisting of a legal
practitioner and two others with extensive knowledge of alcohol
and other drug treatment. In conjunction with the offender and
relevant treatment agency, the panel makes a recommendation to
the court which will determine the length of time the person
should spend at the treatment centre and the pattern of periodic
reviews. If the person consistently fails to appear for review or
fails to undertake the treatment program, a summons may be issued
and the person dealt with by the court in the normal way.
Diversionary programs mandated by legislation also exist in South
Australia, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. The
method of operation of the diversionary programs differs from
case-to-case. Diversionary systems in other countries illustrate
a further variety of options. </p>

<p>Although only a tiny minority of cannabis users report
problems with the drug serious enough to require treatment, it is
widely accepted that a prison sentence is an unsatisfactory
option for many offenders with drug problems, and diversion for
the purpose of treatment is a widely used alternative, one
welcomed by judges and magistrates. Criminal justice system
involvement is seen as providing an opportunity to intervene in
drug users' lives in order to confront them with their drug
problems and to bring them into contact with treatment agencies.
In some cases, merely attending for assessment is sufficient to
bring about a change in a person's attitude. While some dispute
exists about the value of coercion, the fact that involuntary
clients tend to spend longer in treatment programs than do
voluntary clients frequently contributes to their exhibiting more
successful treatment outcomes. It should be noted, however, that
few cannabis users need treatment for dependence on cannabis as
such. Rather, their needs are more likely to centre around their
lifestyles and psychological needs generally. </p>

<p>A number of countries, and within Australia the State of
Victoria, have legislative provisions relating to civil
commitment for the compulsory treatment of drug users, generally
people deemed to be drug dependent. In Victoria, for example, a
person who is dependent on alcohol and/or other drugs and who is
considered suitable for treatment may be committed for treatment
for a period of seven days, and at the discretion of the medical
officer in charge of the assessment centre, for a second seven
days. Civil commitment is widely used for drug users in the
United States. It is generally applied to people who come to the
attention of the criminal justice or the health systems, and who
refuse to enter treatment voluntarily. The individual is referred
for medical examination and, on the basis of that examination,
may be committed to compulsory treatment. Naturally, this raises
serious issues regarding the civil rights of the individuals
involved, as decisions are made about their liberty without
referral to a court. The relevance of such programs to
legislative options for cannabis in Australia are limited, owing
to the fact that very few cannabis users have problems with
dependence on the drug, and there is little evidence that
treatment, as it is generally understood, has much to offer
cannabis users. </p>

<h2><a href="can_ch6.htm">Chapter 6: Evaluating new legislative
approaches to cannabis</a> </h2>

<p>The principle of evaluating new policy and legislation is
widely accepted but is less frequently observed in practice. In
Australia and most other Western nations, insufficient has been
done, especially by government agencies, to monitor and evaluate
their national drug policies. This is the case in instances where
drugs legislation has been developed incrementally, and also
where new approaches have been implemented following detailed
policy reviews. Too often evaluation is considered relevant only
after a policy has been in place for some time and changes are
being considered. To be of most value, new initiatives should be
designed and implemented with an explicit and adequately
resourced monitoring and evaluation component built into the
initiative from the outset. Policy evaluation is a different
process from program evaluation, having different goals and
research techniques. </p>

<p>Australia's National Drug Strategic Plan 1993-97 provides the
framework within which we base our recommendations relating to
monitoring and evaluation. The plan points out that 'the overall
mission of the National Drug Strategy is to minimise the harmful
effects of drugs and drug use in Australian society'. Policies
and programs in specific areas, including cannabis, should be
evaluated in a manner consistent with this national goal. </p>

<p>Decision-making relating to legislative options for cannabis
in Australia can be conducted in an ad hoc manner, but clearly
the application of more systematic policy choice models is
preferable. Two groups of such decision-making models are
available to governments, the 'rational' and the 'incremental'
approaches. A rational decision-making model is one which goes
through logical steps to clarify the context of the legislative
initiative, its goals, the rationales for the goals and the
likely impacts on key stakeholders. It includes a careful
analysis of the data available to evaluate the proposed approach.
The process would end in making judgments regarding the
appropriateness of the goal or goals, how achievable the goals
are and, if the goals are judged to be achievable, how effective,
efficient and appropriate are the implementation options
available. This systematic, rational approach to policy
evaluation is not often enough seen in the development of drugs
policy. Nevertheless, the National Drug Strategic Plan provides a
clear framework for engaging in this type of analysis. The
information presented in this report, along with the research
reports prepared by other groups for the National Task Force on
Cannabis, provides a firm base for the making of rational policy
choices. </p>

<h2><a href="can_ch7.htm">Chapter 7: Conclusion</a> </h2>

<p>Australia's National Drug Strategy provides a policy framework
within which new legislative approaches may be developed. Both
existing and newer approaches have the possibility of both
enhancing and detracting from the achievement of the mission of
the National Drug Strategy, that of minimising the harmful
effects of drugs and drug use in Australian society. </p>

<p>No best single option for cannabis legislation exists. What is
most appropriate will depend upon what goals both policy makers
and the community are seeking to achieve. Our review suggests
that two of the five legislative options discussed above are
inappropriate in contemporary Australian circumstances. They are
the options which we have characterised as total prohibition and
free availability. Australia experiences more harm, we conclude,
from maintaining the cannabis prohibition policy than it
experiences from the use of the drug. We also reject the
legislative option of the free availability of cannabis. Our
society is one that accepts that governments and others have both
the right and the responsibility to intervene in diverse ways to
protect people from harm and to advance the common good. It would
be unreasonable, therefore, to argue that cannabis should be
available in an uncontrolled manner. </p>

<p>We conclude that cannabis law reform is required in this
country. Many options for policy, legislation and implementation
processes exist within the broad categories of prohibition with
an administrative decision that it is inexpedient to prosecute
people for minor cannabis offences, prohibition with civil
penalties, partial prohibition and regulated availability. We
believe, on the available evidence, that widely accepted social
goals, well attuned to the needs of contemporary Australian
society, will be attained through the adoption and implementation
of policies which lie within these options. </p>

<p> <b>Chapter 1. </b> </p>

<h1>INTRODUCTION </h1>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.GIF"><br>
</p>

<p> Australia's National Drug Strategy is widely acclaimed, both
in this country and internationally, as a world leader. It
features a balance between action addressing the demand for and
supply of drugs. It involves a partnership between the government
and non-government sectors. It addresses all drugs, both
currently licit and illicit. Above all, its overarching goal is
to minimise the harmful effects of drugs and drug use in
Australian society (MCDS 1993). It does not have the
impossible-to-achieve goal of eliminating drug use nor the
simplistic approach of addressing just one class of drugs (the
currently illicit ones), the approaches taken by some other
nations. </p>

<p> The project to which this paper contributes is part of
Australia's National Drug Strategy. Under the auspices of the
[1]Commonwealth/State Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy, a
National Task Force on Cannabis was formed, to prepare a paper
summarising current knowledge about cannabis use; the paper will
be used by the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy to assist it
in developing a national statement on cannabis. As part of this
process, the Australian Institute of Criminology has been
commissioned by the National Task Force on Cannabis to prepare
this paper addressing the legislative options available for
cannabis in Australia. </p>

<p> We have approached the project with an interdisciplinary
orientation, drawing on legal, criminal justice and social
science perspectives. Much of the material presented is factual
information that we believe will assist policy makers and the
community at large to think systematically about cannabis policy
and legislation in Australia; where we have expressed our
opinions on legislative options, this has been made clear. The
paper is structured as follows. </p>

<p> After these introductory remarks, in [2]Chapter 2 we discuss
the issue of policy goals regarding cannabis, arguing that
legislation should not be seen independently from the policies it
implements. We seek to clarify the key issues which underpin
cannabis policy, focusing on the goals of those policies, since
much of the confusion about cannabis policy options and their
effects reflects confusion concerning the policy goals. [3] </p>

<p> Chapter 3 places cannabis in context. A brief overview of the
history of cannabis in Australia and elsewhere is presented. We
then describe the legislative context of Australia's cannabis
policies: domestic legislation and international treaty
obligations are discussed. [4] </p>

<p> Chapter 4 addresses the range of legislative options
available. It describes the options, discusses their rationales,
presents information on the impacts of those options and reviews
them in terms of the goals which they seek to achieve. Five
distinct options are dealt with. At the specific request of the
National Task Force on Cannabis we include, as [5] </p>

<p> Chapter 5, a discussion of the diversion, from the criminal
justice system, of cannabis offenders, and the related topic of
the compulsory treatment of cannabis users. This chapter, like
the previous ones, draws upon both Australian and overseas
experience in these areas. The focus of [6] </p>

<p> Chapter 6 is the process for evaluating legislative options
for cannabis. We discuss both policy evaluation and program
evaluation, as they are usefully dealt with separately. [7] </p>

<p> Chapter 7 concludes the main part of the paper. There we
revisit the central issues of the preceding chapters and make
recommendations regarding the legislative options for cannabis
which we consider most appropriate for contemporary Australia.
Consistent with our consultancy brief, we do not make detailed
recommendations along these lines. Rather, being researchers and
not policy makers, the approach that we have taken is to indicate
those legislative options that we consider to be inappropriate,
and to indicate the dimensions of the policy making task for
dealing with the remaining options. </p>

<p> Three appendixes (touching upon the medical and
horticultural/industrial uses of cannabis, and information about
the authors) are included, along with a listing of source
material that the authors found particularly useful. </p>

<p> We are conscious of the fact that this paper is one of four
being prepared for the National Task Force on Cannabis. The
others address the health impacts of cannabis use, consumption
patterns in Australia and public opinion concerning cannabis. The
findings of the other research teams in their respective areas
should be considered concurrently with the information set out in
the following chapters. Reference Ministerial Council on Drug
Strategy 1993, National Drug Strategic Plan 1993-97, AGPS,
Canberra. </p>

<h2>POLICY GOALS </h2>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.GIF"><br>
</p>

<p> Given the importance which is assigned to setting clear goals
for any major social policy, it is surprising how infrequently
discussion of drug policy is preceded by a precise specification
of what the policy is intended to achieve. Too often, goals are
either global (to reduce drug use) or unattainable (to eliminate
drug use) and allow many interpretations. Similarly, goals are
often stated in such a way that they could be achieved through a
number of quite contradictory strategies and at vastly different
costs (economic, social, and personal). Only infrequently does
the discussion address the issue of the costs we are willing to
tolerate in order to achieve stated goals. Rarely is detailed
consideration given to how we might go about measuring the costs,
both of drug use itself and of attempts to control it. </p>

<p> In examining the range of potential regimes for the control
of cannabis use, it is important to have a clear idea of the
criteria against which we might evaluate their effects. Yet
unambiguous and meaningful statements of the objectives of
cannabis policies are difficult to find anywhere. Most official
statements about drug policy generally, and most discussions
about drug control strategies, suffer from one or more of a
number of limitations. They may fail to proffer specific goals.
They may state goals which are known to be unattainable. They may
fail to recognise the existence of multiple goals or, if they do,
they may fail to acknowledge contradictions between them or to
provide a means for assigning priorities when the goals clash. </p>

<p> All of these failings contribute to a policy debate which
lacks precision and intellectual rigour, and whose outcomes
depend more on rhetoric and emotion than on logical argument and
empirical data. This report starts from the proposition that it
is important to know what are the requirements for rational drug
policy in general and what are the objectives of cannabis policy
specifically. Only when these issues are articulated clearly and
can be subjected to full public scrutiny can it be said that the
cannabis policy debate has become a comprehensive and rational
one. The issues discussed in this chapter can be applied, with
suitable modifications as to specifics, to any area of drug
policy. In this chapter we do not take any position on particular
policy options. Our intention is to provide a comprehensive
framework within which any option can be evaluated. </p>

<p> We intend in this chapter, too, to address the issue of drug
policy, rather than drug legislation. As our discussion of
legislative options will show, similar-looking laws may have
quite different implications for cost and effectiveness depending
on the way in which they are administered. In other words, the
policy context may be more important than the legislation in
understanding the impact of a particular approach to cannabis
control. For example, in both the United States and The
Netherlands it is illegal to possess and sell personal-use
quantities of cannabis. The way in which the legislation is
interpreted and enforced, however, puts these two countries at
different ends of the cannabis policy spectrum (Wardlaw 1992). </p>

<p> In its turn, the policy framework adopted in any particular
country can only be understood fully if the observer is aware of
the social and political context within which social problems are
viewed, and with a knowledge of the nature and dimensions of the
drug problem in that country. Some conceptual clarifications
Kleiman and Saiger (1992) suggest that discussion of options for
drug control policy should be preceded by agreement on some basic
conceptual clarifications. These clarifications are intended to
define the nature of a satisfactory debate about drug control
options. </p>

<p> The following list is a modification and extension of Kleiman
and Saiger's suggestions. </p>

<ol>
    <li>Arguments that apply to the most appropriate control
        regime for one drug need not - and often do not apply to
        others. There has been considerable resistance to the
        idea that use of different drugs may best be controlled
        by different strategies. Certainly, a dominant theme in
        the drug control policies of many countries is that it is
        necessary to have consistent policies towards illicit
        drug use. It is argued that treating different illicit
        drugs differently, especially when 'differently' implies
        that one drug will attract less law enforcement attention
        or less social disapproval than another, will undermine
        the general authority and credibility of anti-drug
        messages. This approach overlooks at least one important
        consideration. That is that there are a number of
        approaches to the notion of consistency. Consistency does
        not necessarily imply that we have to have a monolithic
        approach to drug problems. We can, for example, have the
        goal of reducing the harm caused by illicit drug use, but
        can achieve that goal by a number of avenues. There is no
        logical reason why these avenues have to be the same for
        all drugs, as long as we can justify why we are treating
        different drugs differently, and as long as we can
        articulate these reasons to the public. The belief that
        we must maintain a rigid adherence to one set of
        strategies for all illicit drugs ignores the reality that
        we already quite successfully accept inconsistencies and
        contradictions in drug policy across the board. The most
        obvious example is the fact that we allow a number of
        drugs, foremost amongst which are tobacco and alcohol, to
        be used legally despite their causing the same types of
        damage against which we try to protect individuals and
        society by banning the use of other drugs. There is
        general agreement that it is the goal of policy on licit
        drugs to reduce the harm caused by their use. We seek to
        achieve this by attempting to persuade people not to take
        up drug use, to decrease their consumption of these
        drugs, or to alter their manner or pattern of use.
        Although the simplest way to reduce harm would be to
        reduce the number of people using the drugs (assuming for
        the argument here that remaining users continued their
        existing consumption levels and patterns), we do not see
        attempts to get others to move to less dangerous patterns
        of use (rather than giving up use) as undermining the
        message that use of drugs is not socially desirable.
        Rather, we recognise that the overall goal of reducing
        harm can be achieved by persuading some people not to
        take up drugs, others to discontinue their use, and yet
        others to moderate their use or to change to less
        dangerous drugs or methods of administration. Strategies
        aimed at moderation are not seen as undermining
        strategies aimed at abstinence. We simply accept that
        different strategies are appropriate for different groups
        in the community and that they can all contribute to the
        overall goal of harm minimisation. There is no logical
        reason why we cannot adopt the same approach with illicit
        drugs. </li>
    <li>Drug policies should be crafted to take account of the
        different patterns and types of harms caused by specific
        drugs. Attempting to impose across-the-board strategies
        for illicit drug control in the name of consistency
        (ignoring for the moment the glaring inconsistency in not
        treating licit drug use similarly) seems to assume that
        all drug problems are, in fact, equally susceptible to
        the same measures. We know, however, that this is not the
        case. Each drug has its own consumption patterns; each
        drug harms users and others in different ways and to
        different degrees; and each has its own demand patterns,
        supply systems and market characteristics (Kleiman &amp;
        Saiger 1992). Not only do drugs differ in these ways, but
        the same drug may exhibit different characteristics in
        different geographical, socioeconomic or cultural
        contexts (Haaga &amp; Reuter 1990). Accordingly, it is
        not logical to expect that there will be uniform
        solutions to drug problems. 'Consistency for the sake of
        it should not be able to stifle the ability of local
        areas, states or nations to deal with drug problems in a
        manner which is appropriate for their circumstances,
        cultural context, dimensions of the problem and so forth'
        (Wardlaw 1992, p154). It follows that decisions about how
        best to deal with problems in relation to a specific drug
        should be made on the basis of the circumstances
        surrounding use of that drug and the practical
        possibilities for intervening in them. </li>
    <li>The details of control regimes are crucial determinants
        of their outcomes. Such details should not be left
        undefined. Much of the confusion over what is the most
        appropriate regime for the control of cannabis use stems
        from poor definition of terms such as 'decriminalisation'
        and 'legalisation', and lack of specification of the
        details of alternative control regimes being debated. As
        the South Australian Royal Commission into the
        Non-Medical Use of Drugs ([1]South Australia 1978)
        commented, people use these terms in a variety of senses
        and are often unaware of the significant differences that
        exist between various methods of control that have been
        proposed under them. We agree with the Commission that
        these terms are not very helpful. The word
        'decriminalisation' sounds as though it refers to the
        removal of cannabis control from the criminal law. In
        practice, however, it usually refers to changes to the
        law which either allow possession of specified amounts of
        cannabis for personal consumption or reduce the penalties
        for such possession to minor fines or administrative
        sanctions involving no criminal record. As such,
        decriminalisation refers to reducing penalties, rather
        than removing them altogether ([2]Single 1989). Under
        most so-called decriminalisation proposals, dealing in
        cannabis would remain a serious criminal offence. The
        term 'legalisation' presents similar difficulties. It
        covers proposals which would literally remove the drug
        from the criminal law, to those which would limit
        availability to adults (much as alcohol and tobacco are
        now regulated), to more specific proposals which would
        allow access through clinics or other health services
        only to those with established habits. Discussing
        'decriminalisation' or 'legalisation' without specifying
        the details of the particular model being proposed is not
        likely to be very productive (Kleiman &amp; Saiger 1990).
        No sensible discussion of any of the options can take
        place without specification of such details as to whom
        proposed changes would apply and under what
        circumstances, rules about advertising, place and time of
        consumption, whether or not the changes would apply to
        all preparations and forms of cannabis (or, for example,
        be restricted to those falling below a certain potency),
        and the type of regulatory arrangements which would
        replace the current law enforcement ones, together with
        details of their methods of operation and costs. 'Such
        details should not be dismissed as easily determined or
        postponed as a problem requiring future thought' (Kleiman
        &amp; Saiger 1992, p225). This report will discuss policy
        options under the broad headings suggested by the South
        Australian Royal Commission into the Non-Medical Use of
        Drugs, i.e. the total prohibition model; the
        prohibition/'civil penalty' model; the partial
        prohibition model; the regulatory model; and the free
        availability model ([3]South Australia 1978). Any
        analysis of control regimes should attempt to estimate
        their effects on both consumption levels and patterns of
        use. A major concern about any lessening of the current
        controls on cannabis is that it might lead to increases
        in consumption. While this is a serious concern, it is
        not the only dimension which needs to be monitored. It is
        also important to estimate how patterns of consumption
        might change under different control options. For
        example, if numbers of users rose slightly, but
        consumption per person fell, or less dangerous forms of
        the drug were used, or less harmful methods of use were
        employed, the overall amount of harm occasioned might be
        reduced and the policy might be judged more successful
        than the status quo. Similarly, if under one option, it
        seemed that numbers of users might fall, but that heavier
        use patterns would emerge, or more potent forms of the
        drug would become more popular, the option might be
        judged less desirable, even though a decrease in numbers
        of users had been achieved. </li>
    <li>Control regimes should not be considered in isolation
        from the problems of implementation and enforcement. In
        attempting to predict the outcomes for users of various
        alternatives to the current methods of cannabis control,
        it is important to specify the costs and problems of
        regulation that would accompany them. In all options
        which have any political reality there remains the need
        to licence, to tax or to regulate to ensure that
        restrictions are observed on such things as sale to
        minors, use in conjunction with the operation of vehicles
        or machinery, potency levels, amounts purchased etc. The
        costs and practical problems of implementation should be
        included in any debate about control options. </li>
    <li>Arguments about consequences of drug use should be
        separated from arguments about morals. Much confusion has
        been engendered in the drug policy debate because of a
        failure to separate the negative consequences of drug use
        from moral considerations. It is quite legitimate for a
        community to invoke moral arguments in determining the
        proper course of drug policy (Wilson 1990). But it must
        be clear that the arguments are moral ones, not morality
        disguised as concern over consequences. If opposition to
        cannabis use is based on the view that it is illegitimate
        to use a drug to alter one's perception, to seek pleasure
        or to become intoxicated (a moral argument), then it
        should be clearly stated as such so that the proposition
        can be debated in those terms. It confuses the issue and
        injects unproductive emotion into the argument if that
        concern is disguised by reference to the harms caused by
        cannabis use. These need also to be debated separately.
        We need to know whether there would still be opposition
        to cannabis use on moral grounds even if we could
        eliminate the health costs. </li>
    <li>Options should be evaluated on the basis of evidence of
        damage. We should require that policies that seek to
        impose expensive control regimes on any drug be based on
        evidence of harm occasioned by use of the drug. The cost
        and restrictiveness of the control regime should be
        clearly related to the damage caused by use of the drug,
        and there should be empirical evidence of the type and
        extent of the damage. </li>
    <li>Any policy should recognise the changing nature of the
        drug problem and be able to change with it. Additionally,
        all policies should be reviewed periodically to ensure
        that they are still relevant to current circumstances. A
        major drawback to current approaches to drug policy is
        that they are generally poor at adapting to changes in
        the nature of the drug problem or to changes in our
        levels of knowledge and understanding of drug use
        processes and patterns and their interactions with
        different control strategies. All policies should have
        in-built capacity for evaluation to enable them to be
        adjusted in a timely manner to emerging patterns of use
        or changes in our understanding of the problem. </li>
    <li>Policy should be made in the light of the costs of
        control as well as the benefits. Discussion of any policy
        option should clearly identify any costs associated with
        it. An attempt should be made to inventory all of the
        direct and indirect costs associated with the option,
        including social costs. It is particularly important to
        include any unintended consequences predicted or
        discovered. For example, what are the substitution
        effects of a particular policy (does enforcement success,
        for example, result in fewer users or do the users turn
        to other, more dangerous drugs)? </li>
    <li>The goals of drug policy should be realistic. Enunciating
        unrealistic goals for drug policy can have a number of
        negative consequences. Foremost amongst these are the
        undermining of the credibility of the policy and the
        justification of extreme methods in their pursuit
        (Wardlaw 1992). </li>
    <li>Discussion of policy options should include a
        specification of which harms they are intended to reduce.
        Specifying the harms intended to be reduced by the
        overall policy and the options within it clarifies
        thinking about goals and provides a necessary basis for
        evaluation. If possible, effects should also be discussed
        according to the dimensions of time (short-, medium-, and
        long-term effects), duration (temporary or permanent),
        and scale (minor, moderate, or major). </li>
    <li>Discussion of cannabis policy (and drug policy generally)
        should recognise the existence of multiple and sometimes
        contradictory goals. It may be necessary to choose
        explicitly between goals, to assign them to a hierarchy,
        or to accept that different goals (and, therefore,
        different strategies and programs) may be appropriate for
        different sub-populations or areas. Examples include
        accepting that it is appropriate to teach established
        users safer methods of use while trying to discourage
        other groups from starting use, or police not arresting
        cannabis users because it is considered to impose an
        unwarranted burden on the court and corrections systems. </li>
    <li>Policies to discourage cannabis use should be shown to be
        effective or be changed. Sound social policy should be
        robust enough to withstand critical scrutiny. The costs
        of current approaches to cannabis control are
        considerable and their continuation should be guaranteed
        only if data can be provided which demonstrate their
        effectiveness. The same criterion should be applied to
        any alternative approach. </li>
    <li>The harms caused by the control regimes themselves should
        not outweigh the harms prevented by them. It is very
        difficult to measure accurately the costs both of
        cannabis use and of efforts to prevent it. Nevertheless,
        it is not good enough merely to assert that a policy is
        the correct one, or to fail to investigate alternatives
        when there is evidence of ineffectiveness (the large
        number of users) and cost (the cost of law enforcement,
        the intrusions on civil liberties, violence and
        corruption caused by forcing sales onto a black market,
        and so on). Any social policy should be reviewed when
        there is reason to believe that the costs of
        administering it outweigh the harms reduced. The goals of
        cannabis policy In deciding upon the appropriate model to
        adopt to control cannabis use, it is necessary to specify
        the goals of the policy, as they will constitute the
        criteria against which selection will be made (and
        against which eventual evaluation of performance will be
        made). The following list comprises possible goals which
        have been mentioned in the literature on cannabis policy.
        It is intended as illustrative of the range of goals
        which might be considered and is not a set of goals
        proposed by this report: </li>
</ol>

<ul>
    <li>to reduce the total amount of cannabis consumed; </li>
    <li>to reduce use among young people; </li>
    <li>to reduce the supply of cannabis to the market; </li>
    <li>to increase the cost of cannabis to the buyer; </li>
    <li>to increase the probability of arrest for a cannabis
        offence; </li>
    <li>to promote safer methods of consumption of cannabis; </li>
    <li>to limit use of cannabis to smaller amounts; </li>
    <li>to limit sales of cannabis to specialist sellers (and not
        to have it sold by dealers in other, more dangerous,
        drugs, for example); </li>
    <li>to limit progression from cannabis use to use of other
        drugs; </li>
    <li>to serve as a symbol of community disapproval of drug
        use; </li>
    <li>to limit the amount of violence in the cannabis
        distribution system; and </li>
    <li>to limit the substitution of other (more damaging) drugs
        for cannabis. </li>
</ul>

<p> This list is not intended to be comprehensive. It is merely
indicative of the range and detail which needs to be considered
when deciding on policy directions and on the resulting
legislation and implementation strategies. Examination of such a
list makes a number of things apparent. One of these is that to
make sense of it requires the assignment of priorities.
Priorities may be of two types. The first is simply to assign a
ranking in order of importance as judged by some defined
criteria. This is useful when attempting to assign resources to
different parts of a total strategy. A consideration which may
also play a part here is the impact that a particular strategy is
estimated to be capable of having. The second involves deciding
between two or more conflicting goals. Considerations here are
likely to include harms caused or prevented, as well as
considerations such as cost and effectiveness. Laying out goals
in this fashion also alerts us to the need for high quality data
for decision-making, and to the need for sound evaluation
methodologies to be able to measure the impact of our policies
and their resulting implementation strategies. Examination of the
list above makes it immediately apparent that extensive empirical
data are required to be able to assign priorities and measure
impacts. The list also provides a practical example of the sorts
of considerations which policy makers should include in their
deliberations as they attempt to apply the conceptual tools
discussed earlier in this chapter. </p>
