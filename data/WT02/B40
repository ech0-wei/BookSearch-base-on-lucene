Assets & Liabilities:  Why Investment Portfolios Are Shrinking


Don't look now, but the investment portfolio is shrinking at most major banks.
A recent survey of mid- to large-sized banks shows over half reduced their
portfolios relative to asset size in 1995 despite overall industry
asset-growth rates of more than 7%.  It's not hard to see why.

First and foremost, banks have been restructuring their balance sheets to
improve liquidity.  According to a recent survey by Olson Research Associates
and the Bank Administration Institute, robust loan demand has fueled an urgent
quest for liquidity since 1993.  Banks have taken net paydowns on securities
or have actively liquidated securities positions to fund the growth of loans.
This ongoing process is the expected flip side of the early 1990s, when there
was strong growth in the portfolio amid poor loan demand.

A second, and more enduring, reason for portfolio shrinkage may be that
investment officers now have to worry about a new dimension of portfolio
management.  These days, the chief investment officer or portfolio manager
must manage not only the yield on the bank's portfolio but also its market
value.  Not that it wasn't always important to manage investment market
values, but the difference now is that evolving accounting standards compel
specific market value disclosure.  Executive managers and stock analysts alike
can exercise greater scrutiny because of the new visibility of portfolio
values.

It all traces back to Financial Accounting Standard 115 for disclosures about
debt instruments.  The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued this
standard in 1993 as part of the Board's long-range project on financial
instruments, initiated in 1986.  FAS 115 creates three different accounting
approaches pertaining to market valuation for banks' and other firms'
investment securities.  For changes in market values of trading securities,
gains and losses are passed through the profit and loss statement and the
capital account.

For "available for sale" securities (AFS), changes in market value are
recognized in the banks' capital accounts and, along with trading securities,
potentially destabilize reported bank capital.  "Held to maturity" securities
(HTM) do not create accounting gains and losses, nor do they impact reported
capital, but they must meet rigorous standards concerning the bank's ability
and intent to hold them until they mature.

Of course, fluctuations in the market values of bank securities are a highly
visible beacon of interest rate risk.  Gap charts in banks' annual reports
appear benign and only mildly suggest interest rate exposures to bank
earnings.  In contrast, changes in market values hit the bullseye of
interest-rate risk measurement and grab the annual report reader's attention.
It's a worrisome thing for executive managements who may connect their
compensation with the need to report ever-improving performance.

I Shrunk the Portfolio

So, naturally, some banking firms have shrunk the portfolio itself to reduce
the impact of portfolio instability.  Many firms view a portion of the
investment portfolio as discretionary.  It's the part funded with
discretionary wholesale money and is not just a parking place for core
deposits.  It's no secret that acquisition-minded superregional banks are
backing away from large wholesale banking positions that add volatility and
are reemphasizing their core businesses.

This strategy contributes to the shrinkage of the portfolio.  Banking firms
are restructuring their balance sheets by laying off gobs of wholesale funds
and the portions of the portfolios that these funds supported; instead, their
balance sheets are absorbing core loans and funds obtained through the
acquisition of smaller banks.

PNC Bank Corp.  provides a good example of portfolio shrinkage.  In mid-1994,
PNC's $22-billion investment portfolio comprised 36% of the bank's earning
assets-quite large by industry standards at that time.  The bank embarked on
an aggressive strategy of emphasizing its core franchise, including a landmark
acquisition of Chemical Bank branches in New Jersey, and backing away from
wholesale funding and investing.  By late 1995, the portfolio had been reduced
to below $19 billion.  In the process, the bank exorcised some troublesome
investments and took heavy losses.

Still, PNC had a problem because HTM securities represented over 80% of the
portfolio.  Under FAS 115, these securities escaped accounting for gains and
losses, but the restrictiveness of the HTM classification tended to freeze
them in place and make them unmanageable.  And transferring part of them into
the AFS portfolio risked regulatory tainting of the remaining HTM securities
that might lead to their subsequent revaluation.

At yearend 1995, in a bold departure from the temptation to disguise the
volatility of its HTM portfolio permitted by FAS 115, PNC was said to be
preparing to transfer all of the HTM portfolio to the AFS classification.
Apparently the bank is now willing to expose all of its securities activity to
market pricing.

The new FASB-driven focus on volatility has changed the way banks view the
purpose of their investment portfolios.  According to the Olson/BAI survey,
chief investment officers most often state that the primary objective of their
securities portfolios is to manage interest rate risk, followed by managing
liquidity.

It would be an understatement to declare that FAS 115 does not get great
support from bankers.  A very legitimate complaint is that it does not allow
for symmetrical market value adjustments to the funding side of securities
positions.  And, like a lot of regulation, it leaves room for inconsistency
among examiners and invites arbitrary enforcement.  It's not clear how much
portfolio shrinkage is due to distaste for the new accounting rules and the
visibility the rules give to investment performance and how much is due to
cyclical effects that sacrifice investment performance in the quest for
liquidity to service loan demand.

Our speculation is that even an imperfect FAS 115 will eventually change the
role and practice of investment management for the better.  Nay-sayers point
out that judging portfolio performance by tracking unrealized gains and losses
does not recognize the awkward role the portfolio must play because it is
routinely whipsawed by the loan market.

In general, if an investment manager is going to take an aggressive position,
it will occur when earnings on the investment portfolio are most critical to
bank profits.  Information on how a bank management team reaches for those
earnings or how it moves cyclically from a liquidity support mode to an
earnings mode ought to be more apparent to users of its financial information.
In this context, market value information ought to add a crucial element of
discipline to future investment management.

Point of view


My vote for the most dynamic banker of the past decade goes to Hugh L.  McColl
Jr., chairman of NationsBank.  I'm not sure he's the best banker, at least not
by the criteria that most people would use, since NationsBank's performance
has tended to be fairly average as measured by traditional yardsticks like
return on assets or loan quality.  I've always thought of McColl as more of a
builder, and banking just happened to be the business that he was in.

McColl was the keynote speaker at a recent industry conference, where he
delivered a stirring wake-up call about the importance of the Internet and
on-line commerce to the industry's future.  McColl is not a tall man, but he
has a deep, booming voice that begins in the soles of his shoes and builds all
the way up.  It was good to hear him say that the industry's greatest threat
is not Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, but rather its own indecisiveness in the
face of change.  McColl is an unlikely person to emerge as banking's most
vocal leader, and yet he played the same role last year with the passage of
interstate banking legislation.  I say "unlikely" because for years, McColl
seemed to have a chip on his shoulder, the hard-bitten ex-Marine who kept a
hand grenade on his desk and had a "war room" where he plotted his merger
strategy.  Who would listen to a guy hell-bent on taking them over?

I've written two stories about McColl since 1987 and learned something each
time.  The first time around, I learned that he doesn't take well to
criticism, as when I wrote that his tough-guy rhetoric was the main reason why
few bankers wanted to merge with him.  His spokesman coolly informed me later
that I had so offended McColl that he wasn't going to talk to the press
anymore.  The second encounter, in 1993, taught me that McColl can be warm and
delightfully down-to-earth as well.  An investment banker told me of flying
into Charlotte, where NationsBank is headquartered, to pitch a deal to McColl,
whom he had not met before.  My source expected someone from the bank to fetch
a colleague and him from the airport-but that "someone" turned out to be
McColl himself, holding up a little sign like a limo driver and grinning from
ear to ear.  Later, as they were racing into town in McColl's BMW, the
chairman spotted a friend who had pulled his car off the highway.  McColl
quickly stopped to see what was wrong.  When they stayed to BS for a while, my
source started thinking this wasn't your normal CEO.

My favorite story also occurred when I was not around.  Photos for the second
piece were shot at a Habitat for Humanity job site, where McColl was helping
build a house.  The photographer told me later that McColl noticed two young
boys playing basketball nearby with a makeshift hoop and backboard.  McColl
disappeared for a while, then returned with a new hoop, which he proceeded to
put up for them.

The point of all this is that McColl might be a more effective leader if
people knew him better.  His trash talk of years past has largely obscured
both his warmth and sense of humor.  The media is partly responsible for this,
but McColl and his advisers share in the blame.  When he appeared on the cover
of Fortune last August crouching with a shotgun while bird hunting, it
reinforced the old image of the hungry predator.  Banking doesn't have leaders
like it did 20 years ago.  It could use a few now, and McColl might fit the
bill if he allowed a fuller, more balanced picture of himself to emerge.

USB Forum:  Talking Mergers


A combination of factors-high stock prices, declining revenue and the fear of
being left behind-helped create a robust market for bank mergers in 1995.  In
an effort to review the year's most significant developments, as well as peer
into the year ahead, U.S.  Banker assembled a crack team of investment bankers
for a thorough discussion about shareholder activism, hostile takeovers and
deal fatigue, to name only a few issues.  The participants were:  Robert A.
Baer Jr., Bear, Stearns & Co.; John Duffy, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods; Kathleen
M.  Fisher, J.P.  Morgan & Co.; J.  Christopher Flowers, Goldman, Sachs & Co.;
John C.  "Hans" Morris, Smith Barney; and Kendrick Wilson, Lazard Freres & Co.
The moderator was John W.  Milligan, editor-in-chief of U.S.  Banker.



USB:  Let's talk a little bit about why 1995 turned out to be such a great
market for bank mergers.  What were some of the things that drove the market?

DUFFY:  The first thing is maybe valuation; stock valuation led the acquirer
universe to be able to pay prices that a lot of the seller universe found
acceptable.  I think you also had a situation with a couple turnarounds where
maybe all of the fixing up had been done.  People like Midlantic, Shawmut and
First Fidelity probably fit that category.  So you had sellers; you had a
universe of people that were maybe not perceived to be sellers two years ago
that today were sellers for a new reason.

WILSON:  I think you might call it a revenue "crunch."  There aren't too many
institutions on their own looking at double-digit revenue growth.  Banks have
benefited from an improvement in credit quality and a steep yield curve, and
now it is tough to get revenue.  Also, many managers are saying, "I can't cut
my expenses any more, I might have to think about an acquisition."

FISHER:  An incredible confluence of events is encouraging merger activity.
Bank stocks are up 50% this year (1995) versus roughly 30% for the market, and
this clearly has made the banks feel well off in terms of their currency.  But
they look ahead and ask where revenue growth is going to come from.  And it is
an amazing dichotomy to have those conversations going on when the stock
prices look so favorable.  So why not use your currency to make an acquisition
now?  It is as good a time as any.  And the sellers appreciate that it is a
great time to sell at these prices, so they are selling.

BAER:  An additional reason is that shareholder activism is responsible for
specific deals; where Michael Price has gone into Chase Manhattan and Michigan
National and taken positions that led directly to those firms turning over.

USB:  Was Michael Price a phenomenon of one-specifically, his involvement with
Chase and whatever pressure he applied there-or does that happen more broadly,
but (in) situations that are not as public?

BAER:  If you look at the 13D filings, there has been-I don't know what the
number would be this year-but probably in the neighborhood of 30 to 40 that
had been filed with a letter attendant to that filing going to the board,
stating that, "We think you should research your various alternatives to
increase shareholder value, including the sale of the bank."  It is not just
Michael, there are several groups out there.



USB:  How many of those situations yielded something similar to what happened
with Chase?

BAER:  I can't think of one of them that so far in 1995 has resulted in the
decision by the institution to sell.

MORRIS:  I think more than the specific cause and effect of a single
shareholder, it is more an aura in the defensiveness of the company that it
creates.  Good management teams are more credible, and the more credible you
are, the less you really care about what any particular shareholder suggests
you should do.  I think many people would say that whether Michael Price
caused the sale of Chase into Chemical is not as much of an issue as whether
it clearly changed the overall tempo and framework in which Chase had to make
decisions.

FISHER:  Shareholder activism has also heightened the sensitivity levels of
directors, and there is now a significant increase in the activism of
directors in many of these situations versus the past.

BAER:  That is important.  The Bank of Boston is an extreme case of where
directors seemingly took the place of management for a while.  I think there
has been a number of examples which have not gone that far, but certainly the
directors are tenfold more involved on a daily basis than they had been in the
past.



USB:  If you are representing a bank that may feel vulnerable to an offer from
another institution, perhaps because it has hit its own revenue wall, and yet
is not ready to surrender its independence, how do you counsel the CEO?  What
is that CEO's obligation when it comes to entertaining a merger offer?

MORRIS:  First off, what is the strategy of the bank?  If you don't have a
plan, you really don't have any reason to think that you can earn a reasonable
return for your shareholders.  Further, you will be forgoing a potential
takeover premium.  I think it is not responsible for a management team to say
we just want an investment banker to defend our position, even though we don't
have a good plan for what to do about it.  The first thing is helping them
sort out strategies of what they can do about this position.

There is a lot of current discussion about that very issue, in terms of what
we mean by the revenue wall and how banks are looking at branches and how they
should be speaking about expenses and efficiencies.  For a long time, banks
had a model that they felt that they could aim towards, and get down to their
peer group in efficiency, and they could adequately manage their
non-performing assets and manage their capital and buy back stock.  It is
clear that you have to go beyond that and have a better plan than your
competitors to be attractive to the market.



USB:  If you have the plan but haven't accomplished it yet, what are you
required to do in terms of reviewing an offer and so on?

MORRIS:  If you have a plan, and you have a good plan, you are not required to
do anything.  You are required to carefully consider things and listen to bona
fide offers.  Ultimately it is the credibility of management and the
confidence that you can create with your own directors and with your ultimate
shareholders-and your ability to execute-that is going to decide whether you
have support for your stock and support to continue to execute that plan.

DUFFY:  Hans is right.  The board needs to be educated in terms of how the
plan will create value for the shareholders.  Otherwise, anybody that walks in
the door with a premium over market could be viewed as legitimate.

WILSON:  Obviously, a plan is important, but if you don't have a good offense,
your defense will be under a lot of pressure.  I think there is no substitute
for frequent and ongoing communication with your shareholders.  A track record
helps.  I think having a board that is well-informed and supportive is key.
This is very important, because many of these activist investors are not shy
about using their telephones or fax machines to contact directors.  There have
been several instances where management with credibility and a good story have
defeated well-organized attacks.  All things being equal, in our experience
management starts with a leg up if they are credible and prepared.



USB:  If you wait until you are under pressure and vulnerable, that is a lousy
time to decide that you need to communicate better with shareholders.

FLOWERS:  Several companies have successfully formulated new plans after
receiving offers.  You might say-in fact I think you would say-it would be
smarter to do it in advance.  That doesn't seem to be necessary.  You asked
what does the company do that has single-digit revenue growth.  One thing
everybody all over the place is doing is buying back their stock in large
quantities and adding two or three percentage points to their growth rate.
That appears to have been a very successful strategy and makes a lot of sense,
I guess.  We will find out.  Maybe they are paying too much for the stock, and
they could have bought it back for less later.  Right now, it seems to make
sense.

The other comment I would make is I think in responding to offers and thinking
about the whole arena, boards and managements have become much more attuned to
the quality of what they are getting.  I don't know if anybody remembers five
or three years ago, I found much more focus on just pure dollars.



USB:  There was at one point this year, and I guess it would have been July or
August, when a series of deals were announced.  It almost seemed like a
frenzy.  What accounted for that?

FLOWERS:  Two factors.  One is, not only the high stock price, but also the
fact that they declined precipitously early in 1995 and then bounced back, and
resulted in managements and boards realizing that it may not be forever that
they can choose their options.  They have to do this at a time when share
prices are high, and that isn't always the case.  And it went through a brief
period where a lot of the options were eliminated and they came back and they
said, "We better get on with this."  The second thing is, I do think there is
a bit of a situation where Party A does a deal and Party B says, "If they did
it, then I will too," and so forth.  For one thing, it makes it more
respectable if your next-door neighbor sells out.

WILSON:  There are two other issues to think about.  First, management
succession can be a factor in deals, particularly among boards where you have
had a very effective and strong CEO who is near retirement with no one
designated as his successor.  A second factor is that many management teams
have equity packages that are worth a lot of money now, as well as severance
arrangements that compensate them for a change of control.

MORRIS:  In some sense, the seminal transaction was First Fidelity in that
light, because here you had someone (Anthony Terracciano) who was not the
typical old CEO, and one who had a lot of institutional credibility.  He was
well-regarded by his peers and well-regarded by the Wall Street analysts, and
he had done extremely well managing that institution.  He laid out in a very
articulate way what his thinking was in deciding to approach a couple of
institutions in a sale, and that led to other boards of directors, and often
individual directors, to call their CEO and ask, "What do we think about
that?"

Frankly, the fundamental facts of the industry are still before us.  There is
revenue growth which is at best five percent for the industry, and you have
some very challenging decisions that need to be made about commitments to
different types of infrastructure, and it is not easy.  And if you have
someone who is a leader like Tony Terracciano coming to the same conclusion, I
think that made it easier for others to go along.  And I don't necessarily
think of this as a cop-out, but it sort of led to a series of discussions
among all banks, which accelerated the trend.

DUFFY:  I think every transaction has an impact on other people's options, and
sometimes they result in fewer options to the remaining institutions, and it
forces them to accelerate their thinking.  Maybe they knew they were going to
sell the institution within the next three years, but all of a sudden one of
their potential partners has just done a deal which precludes the combination
of the two of them.  He now has only two potential partners left.  He would
rather be in the position of negotiating or having an option with two of them
rather than having just one person left on the dance floor.



USB:  The fundamental factors that we have talked about vis-a-vis 1995-a
revenue wall, strong currency, sound asset quality-they all seem to still be
in place today.  What would you anticipate in terms of 1996?

BAER:  I think one thing that will force people to rethink their future is
that many of the companies in the last few years have focused on cost-cutting.
But to the extent that savings have been derived, it is not a recurring
source.  As banks reach the end of their cost-cutting, they have to look
elsewhere for revenue.  I think the banks then have to go back to basics and
ask, "How will we get the revenue up again?"  That is forcing them to turn to
acquisitions as a way to increase revenue.  So, if things stay in place, if
the market remains strong and the P/Es stay high for the acquirers, I think
you will see a continuation of this.

FLOWERS:  I sense a fair amount of deal fatigue out there.  I think with the
huge deals, it is hard to do more than one at a time.  One thing we will see
is people assimilating some of the very large transactions before moving on to
the next one.  That doesn't take that long.  I mean, nine months or a year
later the whole world could change.  In the short run, it will affect the
market.

BAER:  That is exactly right for the bigger deals.  This year we have had far
fewer numerical deals than last year or even the year before.  I don't think
there is the same deal fatigue at the smaller institutions, and I believe we
will probably see in 1996 more smaller transactions rather than larger
transactions.



USB:  Deal fatigue:  Chris, is that a reason why it seems that in the last two
or three months (deal) volume has really flattened out?

FLOWERS:  I think that is some of it.  There are a certain number of potential
deals, and we went into it, we used a lot of that in 1995, and I think there
will be somewhat less until everybody reloads.

MORRIS:  I sense that a pricing discrepancy has begun to emerge.  You have
seen some very high prices get paid on a price-to-book basis, and that has led
to higher expectations on the part of sellers, and yet at the same time, I
think lower expectations on the part of buyers, which could be a function of
deal fatigue, but also a sense of uncertainty about how to value
infrastructure systems.  However, the seller's expectations have not evolved
at all.  Five percent revenue growth and larger provisions coming in 1996-and
we see evidence of that all over the place-is inconsistent with some of these
valuations.  I think that you will have some significant discrepancies emerge.



USB:  There were several deals this year that were priced a little bit north
of two times book, and involved some fairly significant dilution.  Were buyers
finally cooled off by shareholders who weren't anxious to see them pay quite
that much for deals?

BAER:  The marketplace actually let them get away with it, by and large.

DUFFY:  It has been pretty tolerant.

BAER:  Three years ago, maybe we would think three percent dilution and earn
out in a year and a half or something, and that is comfortable.  We are in a
stage far beyond that with a lot of transactions.  I am just a little
astounded that the market has been acquiescent of the banks taking the stand
that they have got a birthright to do one large strategic deal.  I don't think
that same tolerance would have been there three or four years ago.

FISHER:  Investors have generally been favorably disposed toward bank
acquisitions this year.  Many of the stocks of the acquirors have bumped back
to their preexisting prices eight or ten days or less after an acquisition is
announced.  The market has been quite willing to believe that projected
savings are achievable.



USB:  Would each of you tell me what you think the most significant deal in
1995 has been so far, and why?

WILSON:  I think the situation involving First Interstate (which is being
pursued in a hostile takeover by Wells Fargo & Co.)  subsumes virtually all of
the elements that we have been talking about.  I think it is a long way from
over.  It could be a precursor of some additional activity, and I think will
certainly bring to the floor all of the issues that we talked about in terms
of shareholder activism.  I think that is an extremely significant
transaction.

FISHER:  I have to agree with that.  Certainly when looking back several years
from now, this deal will be memorable because it is big and dramatic.  And
maybe we can even hypothesize that one of the reasons there is a bit of a
pause in the market now is that all of the banks are watching to see how this
transaction unfolds, because it does have a lot of precedent-setting aspects
to it.  But I think we can't give short shrift to all of the other large deals
that were done this year, because each one of them did set new precedents.
The Chase and Chemical merger certainly should be looked upon as an
extraordinary transaction in the U.S.

MORRIS:  I already (noted) one earlier, so I will add First Chicago and NBD to
my list.  When it happened, it kind of refocused many of us on the
opportunities of mergers of equals.  The recent transactions leading up to
that deal indicated that there was tremendous investor pressure on an
institution to sell out at a premium.  And the fact that First Chicago and NBD
were able to convince investors on the value, balance street restructuring and
business line benefits of the combination, led to an immediate improved
valuation for both companies' stocks.  That was very significant, compared to
the transactions that were leading up to it.

DUFFY:  I agree with Kenny that First Interstate stole the limelight from the
rest of the sector, for at least the time being, and it has implications.  I
think First Fidelity was kind of interesting in that it was the first big
interregional deal, and that was kind of like the dam breaking a little bit.
One that probably may not be mentioned was Fleet/Shawmut in terms of the
market dominance that it created in New England.  I don't think that you have
seen that in other places else yet.  In the Midwest or Southeast, it is still
pretty fragmented.

FLOWERS:  I think since we have run out of significant deals, I will suggest
the company that got the luckiest this year.  I will offer up United Counties
Trust Co., which managed to get a double dip and was acquired first by
Meridian and then by CoreStates.

BAER:  That was not strategic.

FLOWERS:  That was luck.

BAER:  If it is one deal, it is First Interstate.  It easily is something that
none of us have seen on that scale before, and/or complexity.  And I think
what's going to be very interesting is the way politics has entered into this
transaction, because we have grown into a situation realizing that we have an
inefficient banking system, and the economics are driving the system to
consolidate to make it more efficient.  We now have politicians who are trying
to keep the inefficiencies for political votes.

We have already got politics starting to enter into the First Interstate
transaction.  It is such a public forum, it will be an ideal place for the
politicians to continue to play.  I think it will be interesting to see how
politics ends up influencing the final transaction.



USB:  Would you expect to see banks continue to build their product
capabilities by doing more focused transactions, consumer finance being one?

BAER:  I think you would, if the banks could.  The difficulty is that the
mono-line companies, whether it is the B/C auto lenders or equity home lenders
today, sell for around 25 and 30 times earnings because there is such huge
growth potential.  But even the pure credit card companies, the pure finance
companies and other business lines that the banks would find very attractive
to enter through acquisition, are all selling at higher multiples than the
banks.  So it becomes a conundrum.  I think there is probably a high desire
and a low capability.



USB:  It makes you wonder about the future of the full-service,
brick-and-mortar bank if it doesn't find some way of taking all of those
product capabilities and tying them together to add value.

DUFFY:  I think we are in the bottom of the third inning, and some people are
talking like it is the eighth inning.  And you look at the Chase/Chemical pro
forma market cap, and it is $20-odd billion.  I mean, supposing tomorrow
Merrill Lynch decided that they wanted to sell-who could they sell to?
Probably a bank.  Banks don't have the P/E today, but I think they have the
cumulative market cap to be a player.  They have consistently lost market
share to the more innovative players, whether it is a mortgage bank or asset
management company or auto finance company, but a bank winds up acquiring them
at some point later in the cycle.

While the market share of the banks has declined dramatically over the past 10
years, the market cap of the industry still (overshadows) most of the
competition.  I think the industry is not dead, and some of the more
progressive players are starting to surface as giant financial intermediaries.
I don't know who the ultimate winners will be.  I think it is still pretty
early in the game.

Retail Banking:  Ringing Up New Customers


Large and brightly decorated, the sign in the Safeway supermarket had a
simple, but symbolic message:  "Now Hiring Bright, Motivated People Our
Customers Will Like."  Interestingly enough, it could serve equally well as a
recruiting poster for any bank that is beginning to open new branches in
retail establishments like supermarkets.

Such signs clearly underscore an attitude bankers are adopting as they embrace
customers on their own turf-in stores where they do the weekly shopping.
Chasing new customers in this ever-changing, highly competitive marketplace
requires new marketing skills, shedding the stodginess and acting like
retailers.

While in-store banking isn't a new phenomenon, it is a fast-growing trend that
clearly has bankers excited.  Community banks, superregionals and even thrifts
are embracing the idea.

Many are staking out prime locations, hoping to gain an advantage over
competitors, while others are developing branches in areas where they didn't
have a banking presence.  While supermarkets have historically made good
partners, they aren't the only homes for in-store branches.  General
merchandise stores like Kmart and Wal-Mart are quickly becoming good locations
as well.

In 1995, the nation's largest banks accelerated their efforts.  Wells Fargo &
Co., BankAmerica Corp., Union Bank, BayBanks Inc., Barnett Banks Inc.,
National City Corp.  and First State Bank all expanded their operations.

The in-store movement has produced more than 3,000 branches, and many more
ribbon-cutting ceremonies are planned for this year.  National Commerce
Services, a Memphis-based consulting arm of National Commerce Bancorp.,
forecasts as many as 5,000 branches by the year 2000.

"Banks are looking for alternative distribution networks," explains Kathleen
Holmes, managing director of the Wharton Financial Institutions Center in
Philadelphia.  "They're doing it for strategic reasons.  Some are entering new
markets.  Others are opening branches where the local market isn't strong
enough to support a traditional branch."

Proponents believe the rewards make the venture worthwhile.  "An in-store
branch can be more profitable quicker than a brick-and-mortar branch."
explains John W.  Garnett, president of International Banking Technologies, in
Norcross, GA.  "There are lower startup costs, a captive audience-a majority
of whom are not already customers."

For example, studies reveal that store branches are less expensive to build
and often become profitable much sooner than traditional branches.
Supermarket branches cost $150,000 to $200,000 to install, while the tab for
traditional branches ranges between $800,000 and $3 million.  Once in
operation, they are also quicker to yield profits.  "In-store branches should
break even in about 18 months," contends NCS president Douglas W.  Ferris Jr.
"If they are not breaking even in two-and-a-half years, something is wrong.
It usually takes a traditional branch about three years to become profitable."

In the '80s, success came easily for the supermarket pioneers.  With access to
30,000 to 60,000 weekly supermarket customers, they attracted new prospects
much faster than traditional branches.  Customers embraced the concept.
One-stop convenience, services that surpassed those of the automated teller
machines and interactive relationships with live tellers were the drawing
cards.  Customers marveled at the thought of applying for a car loan while
completing their weekly grocery shopping.

And sometimes a bank really hits the jackpot.  One elderly gentleman opened a
$1 million savings account at a southern supermarket branch because he felt
safer.  "In a supermarket, a person walking out with groceries doesn't expose
themselves.  No one knows that they've cashed their check.  It's not uncommon
to see customers open very large accounts at supermarket branches," explains
Garnett.

For many, the benefits continue.  Throughout the country, supermarket bankers
report impressive financial results.  Many produced spectacular revenues
during their first few months of operation.  In Memphis, the Tri-State Bank
proudly touts how it opened 1,155 new deposit accounts during the first
quarter of '95.  Twelve hundred miles away in North Dakota, the First National
Bank's Hugo branch celebrated its 288th new account.

But the novelty has pretty much worn off, and customers want more than mere
convenience.  And there have been some failures.  Banks that entered a local
grocery store without studying the local demographics or developing a
strategic plan for serving that customer base generally have not done as well.
"Some banks have (treated) them like a branch, but they don't work like a
traditional branch," notes Holmes.  "They are more like a community bank.  You
have a closed community, so your capacity to the market is more like that of a
community bank."

Success begins with knowing the difference between supermarket and
brick-and-mortar branches.

"The key to success is in hiring the right staff," explains Garnett.  "You
also must have frequent marketing and promotional programs, as well as
streamlining operations and freeing up people to go out into the aisles and
sell."

The People's Bank of Connecticut grasped that concept a few years ago.  Today,
it operates 45 branches in Stop 'N Shop stores and plans another 46 by the end
of next year.

"You have to change your thinking," suggests Bryan Huebner, senior vice
president with the human resources and strategic planning unit for the bank.
"You have to advertise, market and sell, Huebner says.  "That requires
employees who are experts in our products.  They must understand how the
products serve the needs of our customers.  We also need employees who know
that the real game is talking to as many customers as possible."

BankAmerica launched its first in-store branch 10 years ago.  As an industry
leader with more than 180 in-store branches, the San Francisco-based giant
foresees future success through further expansion into the supermarket arena.

"To capitalize, you have to do things differently," cautions William G.
Raymond, senior vice president for retail distribution at BankAmerica.  "You
need to hire different kinds of people.  You need to train differently.  You
have to set different goals and you need different operating practices.

"One of the keys to success is getting out into the aisles and meeting
prospects," he explains.  "That's not something that many traditional bankers
feel comfortable doing.  We like to have people who are not specialized
tellers or sellers.  You need people who can do many things."

Raymond believes banks should train their sales force to act more like their
store colleagues and maintain a quality relationship with their host grocer.
Such mundane, non-banking chores as knowing how to operate the public address
system and learning the location of store merchandise are also important.  For
instance, it might not be a bad idea to know where various items are located
in the store-just in case a customer happens to ask.

Learning how to read body language is another important skill.  "You should
know when the customer wants to be bothered and how long you hold their
attention," he explains.

Supermarket bankers may want to provide the same products and services as a
conventional branch, but they have to work quicker.  "Because customers don't
want to stand in your lines long and don't have much time, you have to be able
to open checking accounts in five minutes.  You have to be able to provide
them with quick loan approvals," Ferris explains.

Technology:  EDS Nabs a Customer at Alltel's Expense


By signing a seven-year check-processing contract with EDS Corp., Republic
National Bank of New York gave Alltel Corp.  the cold shoulder.

Alltel had already sold most of its check-processing business to Fiserv Inc.,
but it held on to its account with Republic, which dated back to 1993.  The
Little Rock, AR, company, formerly known as Systematics, put its check unit on
the block early this year after it took a $32-million write-off from a failed
investment in imaging technology.

Fiserv executive vice president Dean Schmelzer would not disclose the amount
his firm paid for Alltel's check business, although an EDS executive put the
value of his firm's business with Republic at $40 million.  When looked at
together, the two transactions make it clear that the check outsourcing
business has boiled down to a two-way competition between EDS and Fiserv.
There are other players in this market, including Transys, which is part of
CoreStates Financial Corp., and the Global Processing Alliance, a joint
venture between Bankers Trust New York Corp.  and First Fidelity Bancorp.  But
EDS and Fiserv have been the most aggressive at signing up new customers.

That aggression is partly driven by a desire to build volume and generate
economies of scale.  EDS and Fiserv both seem intent on gaining a large enough
client base to make imaging technology cost-effective.

"We've made a commitment to provide image capability to our clients," says
Schmelzer.  But in order to make it work, "you've to have the volume."

Alltel's inability to deploy image technology successfully isn't discouraging
either EDS or Fiserv from going ahead with their own plans to use imaging,
although both data-processing companies will move forward slowly.  It will be
at least a year before EDS converts Republic to imaging.  For the time being,
EDS will process the New York bank's checks using conventional technology.
Two California thrifts for which EDS does item processing, Great Western
Financial Corp.  and First Nationwide, will be converted to imaging much
sooner, but they have been EDS customers for several years.

The problems Alltel ran into make it clear that imaging technology is far more
complicated than has been acknowledged, but EDS is still confident it will
avoid the same mishaps because it is working closely with IBM Corp.  to modify
that supplier's system to its own needs.  The Dallas company is taking an
approach that lets it avoid redesigning its check operations from top to
bottom, which is what most imaging installations have called for until now,
says Dan Talbott, EDS' vice president for its check operations.

Most of EDS' current check-processing system will remain intact, apart from an
imaging camera that will be inserted into the middle of the operation.  The
data sent to the mainframe that manages the check shop will look essentially
the same as it does with a system running conventional technology.

"What we're doing allows us to leverage our existing platform," Talbott says.

If done according to plan, imaging technology will help both firms reduce
their costs, says Fiserv's Schmelzer.  In the hotly competitive outsourcing
business, survival is quickly becoming dependent upon being a low-cost
provider.


A Small Shift Away From Big Business

There's been a modest but meaningful increase in the percentage of banks' cash
management revenue stemming from small business customers, according to the
latest cash management survey from Ernst & Young.

Some 17% of the proceeds in cash management-where banks manage corporations'
direct deposit, wire transfer and accounts payable and receivable-came from
small businesses in 1994, up slightly from 15% in 1993.

Large corporate customers still accounted for a significant plurality of cash
management revenue, about 38%, but that figure is off from the 44% they
contributed in 1993.

To some extent, this increase could have been anticipated.  In recent years,
Fortune 500 firms and other large bank customers have sharply reduced the
number of banks from which they purchase cash management services, according
to Larry Forman, a manager with Ernst & Young.  On the other hand, banks have
increased the number of products suited for their small business clients.

"Small business has become an important segment," Forman says.

This shift is even more pronounced for mid-sized regionals and smaller banks,
where small business customers contribute 29% of cash management revenue.  For
the largest regional and money center banks, small businesses only account for
7% of cash management.  These big banks are still heavily dependent upon the
biggest corporate accounts, getting some 46% of their cash management revenue
from them.  But even for them, that figure is down.  In last year's survey,
the industry's behemoths garnered some 50% of their revenue from their largest
accounts.

The greater dependence on small businesses helps explain why so many banks
have rushed into the market with cash management software, according to Linda
Vanadis, an assistant vice president with Boatmen's Bancshares Inc.  The
$32-billion-asset St.  Louis regional company is one of several banks that has
begun marketing a personal computer-based cash management software program in
the last few years.

Vanadis says that many small business clients have bought PCs already loaded
with Microsoft Corp.'s Windows for their accounting and other business
functions, and many banks have decided that if they are to serve this market,
they must sell a cash management system that runs on Windows.

Networks' Age And Size Cut Debit Card Fees

The largest debit card networks also have some of the lowest fees, according
to the latest data book from Debit Card News, a Faulkner & Gray publication.

Interlink, the debit card network owned by Visa International, not only
processes 15 million transactions a month, which is by far the largest number
of any network, it also charges a switch fee of only 3 cents a transaction.
By comparison, Explore, the next largest network that is owned by the West
Coast automated teller network, Star System Inc.  of San Diego, charges 5
cents.  Most of the other large regional networks charge roughly 5 cents to 8
cents per transaction.

"The older the programs are, the more the fees have come down," says Art
Clark, a partner with Business Dynamics, a consulting firm in Nyack, NY.
"It's a function of cost and market pressure.  There's just no way that a POS
transaction can carry the same cost" as a check or cash transaction.  About
the only way to entice retailers into accepting debit transactions is to make
electronic payments less expensive than paper ones.

The West Coast was one of the first markets where debit cards were widely
used, and the networks with a heavy concentration of accounts there, Interlink
and Explore, have the lowest fees.  By comparison, networks in the Midwest,
such as Cash Station and Magic Line, have some of the highest fees.  Their
home markets, Illinois and Michigan, were relative latecomers to the debit
card party, adopting this technology several years after the networks in
California and Texas.  Magic Line's switch fee is 13 cents, while Cash
Station's is 11 cents.


Fed Fills Its Technology Gaps

Now that the Federal Reserve System's massive computer system consolidation is
just about finished, the central bank's Automation Services group has shuffled
its organizational structure and hired a former KeyCorp executive as the first
chief information officer in its history.  He will supervise the nine
mainframes the Fed runs out of three data centers.

"In the first few years of FRAS (Federal Reserve Automation Services), there
was a focus on setting the organization up," says Robert Tucker, the Fed's new
senior vice president for computer operations and technical support.  Until
last fall, he had been an executive vice president for Key Services Corp.  in
Cleveland.

Prior to the formation of FRAS in 1992, each of the Fed's 12 district banks
had its own data center.  But the cost of maintaining them was very high, and
since the cost of long-distance telecommunications has dropped sharply, the
Fed closed nine of the existing centers and created three large ones in
Richmond, VA, where FRAS is headquartered; Dallas and East Rutherford, NJ.
Tucker, will report to Carl Powell, the Fed's director of automation
resources, until Powell retires later this year.

Two communications centers are also part of the FRAS network, one in Richmond
and another in Chicago.  There are four other groups within the FRAS
umbrella-support services, administrative services, national network services
and planning and customer support.

Big Changes At The FDIC

Don't look for business as usual at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., where
chairman Ricki Helfer is shaking things up bigtime.

First and foremost, the agency is shrinking-understandably so from
unrealistically high levels created during the last recession, when failures
were running at a near-record pace.  Helfer says that expenses were to be
trimmed 20% in 1995 and staffing was to be cut 14%; altogether, staff levels
will have fallen by more than a third from mid-1993.  She won't predict just
where core staffing will settle, but says "it will be far less" than it is
now.  In November, the agency announced a buyout program intended to spur 500
employees to leave voluntarily.

"I want to run the FDIC the way a business operates-by striving for greater
productivity and enhanced performance, by using rigorous cost/benefit analysis
and by relying on up-to-date management concepts and technology," Helfer told
the America's Community Bankers convention in a speech in late October.

In a subsequent interview, Helfer said she had brought the FDIC its first-ever
strategic and operating plans.  The first is a five-year plan; the latter,
which looks out 12 to 18 months, is more flexible and encompasses some 150
projects.  "We are viewing the familiar as if we had never seen it before,"
she said.

The chairman also noted that she is asking staffers to concentrate anew on the
ability to assess broad risk-not just clean up in its aftermath.  Too often
the agency has tended "to look at the trees (individual banks) and not the
forest," she argues, adding that it's critical to understand the impact of
state legislation, regional economic distinctions and rolling recessions.

Helfer cheered many in the ACB audience when she promised to reduce the
regulatory burden, especially that falling "disproportionately on smaller
institutions."  Time spent on examinations is dropping as the agency turns
more to computerization; she said that 10 hours have been trimmed off
compliance exams since last January, and five hours off Community Reinvestment
Act exams.

Not surprisingly, there are rumblings that agency morale is less than robust
as further job cuts loom.  But Helfer is marching ahead to an ambitious
refrain.  "We must," she says, "move from the New Deal into the new
millenium."


What Does Future Hold For The FHLBS?

Just what is the mission of the Federal Home Loan Bank System?  Most
knowledgeable people in Washington would say promoting housing finance.  But
the chairman of the Federal Housing Finance Board, which oversees the
FHLBanks, says that may not turn out to be its role, going forward.

Bruce Morrison, who became the FHFB chief last year, says a key role is to
provide "local credit availability in cases where that isn't necessarily
available"-in a community where deposits are scant, for instance.  Members of
the FHLB System routinely use it for advances for housing finance, as well as
for low-cost borrowings.

"I think the system would be likely to survive as it is, but it would be
under-utilized," he says.  Morrison argues that the system needs "regulatory
room to develop, and not a narrow blueprint from Congress."  But Republicans
in the House, in their budget-trimming zeal, have been eying
government-sponsored ventures like the FHLB System for an amputation, if not
outright execution.

Morrison contends that system membership should be fully voluntary-a notion
that pleases thrifts, many of whom have been mandatory members for many years,
carrying large FHLB balances as assets on their books.  Commercial banks,
however, have been admitted since 1989 as voluntary members, free to come and
go as they wish.

The FHFB chairman says the board is in the "bizarre position" of being both
regulator of the system and the statutory issuer of its debt, a position it's
trying to extricate itself from.  Meanwhile, the board has been working on
ways to delegate more management functions to the district banks.  "We'll set
the compliance standards, and they'll determine how" to reach those, he says.
A laudable goal.  Now we'll see if Congress goes along and spares the ax.

Getting Credit For Profits


The industry's strong profitability in recent years has done wonders for bank
balance sheets, not to mention credit ratings.  If you assigned a numerical
value to every rating on the Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co.  scale-one for
AAA, two for AA+ and so on-the average rating for a bank holding company in
the firm's universe in 1991 was 7.3, or between A- and BBB+.  This average had
improved to 6.3 (A/A-) by year-end 1993, and to 5.8 by the end of 1994-which
is a good solid A, leaning toward A+.

But the pace of upgrades has slowed dramatically since 1992 and 1993, explains
D&P group vice president Charles Orabutt.  D&P upgraded 24 banks in 1992, 15
in 1993 and only 12 last year.

Realistically, industry balance sheets may be as strong as they're going to
get.  A great many institutions are over-reserved for loan losses, and some of
them have so much excess capital that they've been buying back stock (U.S.
Banker, January 1995).  Any further improvements in credit ratings will
probably come from the earnings side, which is where Orabutt and his band of
bank debt analysts have turned their attention for now.  "We're really
focusing on business line profitability," he says.  "That's the linchpin to
further rating upgrades."

What businesses does D&P like?  It's keen on consumer lending because it tends
to have higher margins, although Orabutt cautions that banks need to have the
right controls in place, since too many of them still try to grow at a 10%
rate when the economy only offers 5%.  Orabutt also favors
technology-intensive, fee-based businesses like check clearing and payments
processing.  And for all the bad press that derivatives have garnered of late,
he figures that providing risk management products to end users will also be a
winner.

ATM USAGE EXPLODES IN '95


Transaction volume on automated teller machines nationwide shot up 14.6% for a
12-month period ending in September 1995, compared to 9.7% in 1994 and only
6.9% in 1993.  The deployment of ATMs also grew 11.3% for the year, and while
this was down from 15% in 1994, it was still the second best performance in a
decade.  The gold medal, however, goes to point of sale:  transaction volume
increased by 37%, while the number of terminals expanded by 47%.  These were
among the findings of an annual survey of the electronic funds transfer
industry conducted by Bank Network News, a twice-monthly newsletter published
by Faulkner & Gray Inc.

Many of the leading ATM networks also posted strong volume gains.  The
country's largest network-Star System-reported a 26.4% gain in transactions
for the 12-month period.

Among the factors cited for the strong growth in overall ATM volume was the
strong likelihood that ATM and POS usage tend to feed one another.  "The
consumer says, 'This card will do everything,'" Tom Bass, president of
Washington-based Exchange network told Bank Network News.  Another possibility
is that a sharp increase in the number of off-premise ATMs is driving the
growth in those transactions.

Internet Security:  The Saga Continues


They may get along with each other about as well as House Speaker Newt
Gingrich and President Clinton, but it seems that Visa International and
MasterCard International are once-again talking turkey about a common standard
for protecting payments over the Internet.

A September announcement that Visa and Microsoft Corp.  would cooperate in
designing a new standard-leaving MasterCard out in the cold-was apparently all
the result of a misunderstanding.  At least that's what the parties now say.

But it seems that at some point there was a disagreement over how the
suppliers of Internet security software would be compensated.  Microsoft was
said to have wanted 0.4% of the value of all card transactions made through
the Internet, according to a November story in USA Today.  The same piece also
alleged that Visa's members, outraged by Microsoft's asking price, forced the
card association back to the bargaining table with MasterCard.

But Microsoft never wanted to be paid on that basis, says Mark Kroese, its
director of electronic commerce; rather the software giant simply wants
royalties from software developers that write programs for Internet commerce.
This is the same source of revenue that IBM Corp., which is part of
MasterCard's camp, will seek.

Spokespeople for both card associations say they never really stopped
discussing the issue, but somehow Visa and Microsoft went ahead with
announcing their security standard without MasterCard's participation.  Back
in June, the associations had said they would announce a standard together.

"We never stopped talking, and we're optimistic about" a common standard, said
David Melancon, a Visa spokesman.  He also said Visa wouldn't pay Microsoft
any transaction fees over the long haul for the security standard, but it
might do so temporarily to cover some development costs.

Melancon also said that Visa was never that out of sync with its members.
"The feedback hasn't been 100% positive" he said, "but it's never 100%
positive on anything.  It's not like they made us do a 360 (degree turn)."

But William Randle, a senior vice president for Huntington Bancshares Inc.
Visa's electronic payments advisory board, says all 22 members of warned the
assdociation in the summer of 1994 not to pursue a relationship with
Microsoft.  Visa later changed the makeup of the board and transferred
responsibility for the board to its home banking subsidiary, Visa Interactive.

The Death Of Spread


Two years ago, bankers could make a pretty good living using cheap sources of
funding to invest in U.S.  Treasury securities.  They didn't have to lend to
get an adequate return; they could simply take cheap short-term funds and use
them to buy higher-yielding treasury bonds, while pocketing a nice spread.
And here was the real beauty of it all:  A U.S.  Treasury bond has no credit
risk (Washington's six-day shutdown in late mid-November over the budget
impasse notwithstanding).

Those days are long gone, of course.  Lenders have opened the credit spigot so
much since then-especially to consumers-that many people now fret they've been
too aggressive.  The spread game seems to have officially ended in mid-1995
when the yield curve-which is the difference between source of funds like Fed
funds or core deposits and the interest rate on investment securities like
treasuries-took on the appearance of a flat line.  Normally, the yield on
treasuries will be higher than the underlying cost of funds, and this margin
becomes more pronounced the further out you go on the investment spectrum,
since a 30-year bond pays a higher rate of interest than a two-year note.

Why did the yield curve flatten out?  The Federal Reserve started tightening
short-term rates in February 1994 and didn't stop until July 1995, when after
a long series of increases it finally cut rates by a modest 25 basis points.
Obviously, those increases put fierce pressure on margins from below.  At the
same time-and somewhat ironically-a generally optimistic view of inflation and
the economy helped bring down rates on long-term bonds, which squeezed margins
from above.

Theodore H.  Tung, Ph.D., chief economist at National City Corp., points out
that 30-year treasuries normally yield at least 1% more than two-year notes,
but that spread has now shrunk to 70 basis points.  "Even more unusual is the
recent disappearance of the spread between yields on two-year notes and the
Fed Funds rate," wrote Dr.  Tung in the November 1995 issue of Financial
Market Outlook, his monthly financial commentary.  "(This) spread has averaged
more than 1% over the past three years."

A flat yield curve is bad news for banks-or at least for their investments in
securities.  "Because the cost of funds is so high, there's no spread," Dr.
Tung explains.  And this largely explains why lenders became so much more
aggressive in 1995.  As the cost of funds went up, they had to turn to
higher-yielding loans instead.  "That's why you see the industry competing for
consumer loans-especially credit cards," he says.  Cards loans at, say, 10%
enable a lender to cover its funding costs and still make a profit.

"National Home Ownership Strategy:  Partners in the American Dream," an
amalgam of more than 50 housing organizations, continues to press toward its
goal of raising the national home ownership rate to 67.5% by 2000, from 64.7%
today.  Henry Cisneros, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, says the target rate would add eight million home owners in five
years.

Equifax, si.  The Mexican government has given the Atlanta-based credit
information company the go-ahead to create a consumer credit information
system that will offer on-line access to Mexican banks, retailers and
businesses.  Equifax, which had applied for permission last May, is already
operating in other Latin American nations such as Chile and Argentina.

Amerin Corp., the Chicago-based mortgage insurer that was the focus of a
December feature story ("Amerin Finds LPMI Isn't the Only Path"), completed
its initial public offering Nov.  29.  The stock quickly soared from its $16
offering price, hitting $27 by mid-December.  The company, which raised over
$213 million in the offering, called the response "a strong endorsement of the
concept of wholesale mortgage insurance."

You won't find many institutional investors crabbing about high CEO salaries,
according to a new study by Russell Reynolds Associates, the major recruiting
firm.  Fifty-six percent of those polled voted strongly against limiting such
pay, and nearly all respondents favored tying CEO compensation to company
performance-letting it ride up, untethered, as long as the corporation and its
stockholders are going with it.

Now accepting the American Express card is that most blue-collar of retail
outlets, Wal-Mart.  AmEx claimed in a news release that more than 14,000
cardholders had written or phoned in 1995 to urge an acceptance agreement with
the world's largest retailer.  Convenience aside, the deal is one more sign
that the elite image AmEx cultivated in the 1980s is giving way to something
more practical.

Branch Sales:  Branches:  There's Still a Market


Sanford Belden is one of those bankers who, with good reason, has every right
to call the industry's staid, familiar brick-and-mortar outposts more trouble
than their worth.

Belden, who is president and chief executive of Community Bank System Inc.  in
Syracuse, NY, had his plans to make the three-hour drive west to his branch in
the hamlet of Olean shredded by the early December storm that dumped three
feet of snow on Buffalo.  That would be enough to convince anyone that it's a
lot easier to bank electronically than in person.  Yet Belden remains devoted
to the 49 branches his company owns in small towns along the rural northern
and western fringes of New York State.

"Having the physical geographic presence is key to our strategy," Belden says.
"We'll look at enhanced ATMs, and we'll look at PC banking.  We view the
alternative delivery as a constructive adjunct to what we do in the branches,
but we think the branch remains the focus of our strategy."

Having a strategy focused on conventional branches was the main reason
Community Bank picked up 17 branches holding $450 million in deposits from
Chase Manhattan Corp.  last July.  A few months later, the $1.1-billion-asset
Syracuse-based company sold three of those branches to NBT Inc., a banking
company in Norwich, NY.  Those offices were in Utica, which is well east of
Community's geographic market.

Of course, central New York state was hardly the only corner of the country
where branches were traded like so much horseflesh.  Plenty of banks large and
small were active in the branch sale business, and few, if any, of them could
be described as iconoclasts swimming against the electronic banking tide, in
which increasing waves of transactions are being done by personal computer,
automated teller and even the Internet.

Rather, they described strategies that were very similar to Belden's-using
ATMs, telephones and PCs to offload most simple transactions like deposits,
withdrawals and balance transfers.  That leaves branches, and branch
personnel, available for the personal attention and the sales pitches that can
increase revenue.

All told, there were some $23 billion in deposits bought and sold in 1995,
according to U.S.  Banker's sixth annual ranking of branch sale advisory
firms.  Yet two-thirds of that total can be attributed to just one deal.  In
September, GreenPoint Financial Corp.  of Flushing, NY, purchased $8.1 billion
in deposits from H.F.  Ahmanson Corp.'s New York operations.  J.P.  Morgan
Co., which advised GreenPoint, and CS First Boston Corp., which advised
Ahmanson, each got credit for the full value of the deposits, and as a result
shared first place.  Without that exchange, there would have been only $6.7
billion in branch deposits changing hands.  In both 1994 and 1993, about $7.5
billion in deposits were bought and sold.

Different Climate

The last three years have been much tamer than the gold rush period of 1990
and 1991, when the Resolution Trust Corp.  was unloading thrift branches by
the truckload.  Now that the RTC is for all practical purposes defunct, branch
sales seem to be returning to a more predictable level of activity.

Interestingly, while most banks are increasing their investments in electronic
services and many banks are shuttering branches, those branches that are put
on the block are commanding high prices.

In 1995, branch deposits generated a 7.3% premium, according to Hovde
Financial Inc., an investment banking firm in Washington.  The premium is the
percentage of deposits that a purchasing bank must pay the seller.  In 1994,
premiums were 5.3%, while from 1991 through 1993 they averaged only 2.6%.

The lure of retail branches has steadily increased in the last several years,
says Bill Boyan, a vice president at Hovde.  One big reason:  It is much
cheaper to buy an existing branch than to start one up de novo.  For example,
Fifth Third Bancorp., which first moved into Cleveland five years ago,
announced it would essentially double its Cleveland franchise once it closed
on its purchase of 28 branches from First Nationwide Bank, the San
Francisco-based thrift.

Cleveland is a mature market, and there are few available sites for new
branches.  "That factors into the premium," says Robert Niehaus, the executive
vice president who runs Fifth Third's affiliate banking groups.  In 1995,
Fifth Third paid just a shade over the industry norm, or about 8% for retail
deposits, Niehaus says.

Fifth Third was one of the busiest branch acquirers last year.  In addition to
the $17-billion-asset company's September announcement of its deal for the
First Nationwide offices, it also bought PNC Bank Corp.'s 12 Dayton branches
in May.  In October, it bought NBD Bancorp.'s 25 Ohio branches, and finally in
November, Fifth Third bought seven Banc One Corp.  branches in Cincinnati.

Niehaus justifies the purchases with reasoning that Community Bank's Belden
would find familiar.  "There are still a significant number of our customers
who want to do face-to-face banking, and secondly it allows us to cross-sell
products to our customers," Niehaus says.

Fifth Third's branch-buying spree underscores the notion that conventional
branches still have an articulated purpose.  Few banks are more committed to
electronic services than Fifth Third, yet it was willing to pay a premium for
branches in some selected markets.

This was also true for Huntington Bancshares Inc., which bought four branches
with $138 million in deposits from Banc One in Springfield, OH, a community of
70,000 people about midway between Dayton and Columbus.

"Is there still room for a full-service branch?"  Thomas Prendergast, a
Huntington senior vice president asks rhetorically.  "Sure there is."
Huntington, despite its development of eight "Huntington Access" branches that
rely almost completely upon ATMs and video kiosks, still has more than 340
conventional branches in Ohio and seven other states.

Complementary Methods

From Prendergast's point of view, the purchase of the four Banc One
branches-two of which were promptly closed upon the deal's completion-hardly
undermines Huntington's commitment to electronic banking.  Rather, each of
Huntington's means of reaching its clientele-whether it's through conventional
branches, the all-electronic branches, PC banking at home, phone banking or
ATMs-all complement one another.

Prendergast, who is the senior Huntington executive for the Springfield
market, simply sees the acquired branches as a means of giving more Huntington
customers more ways to reach the bank.  Now that the bank has six branches in
Springfield, it will open a seventh outlet this year.  This site will not be a
branch, however, but a drive-up ATM in a shopping mall.

The message that comes through all this buying and selling is that electronic
banking has its purpose, but so does the branch.  More importantly, not only
can the two co-exist, but managed intelligently, they can complement one
another.  Despite the growing importance of electronic banking, there are some
communities where the branch will likely remain the primary means of serving
customers.

For example, few states are as top-heavy with behemoth holding companies as
North Carolina.  In Charlotte, there are NationsBank Corp.  and First Union
Corp.  Then there's Winston-Salem, where Wachovia Corp.  and Southern National
Corp.  are based.  Most of them are also among the industry's technological
elite, with PC banking programs and smart card initiatives that regularly grab
headlines.

Yet Triangle Bancorp, an $800-million-asset Raleigh company that does all of
its business in the state, has carved out a nice niche for itself in the rural
communities east of Interstate 95.  For the most part, its larger competitors
do the bulk of their business out of North Carolina, and most of the in-state
business they do is based in the large cities in the state's middle and
western sectors-Charlotte, Winston-Salem, Durham and Greensboro.

Triangle bought four Raleigh branches with $55 million in deposits from First
Union, and it also purchased three NationsBank branches with deposits of $49
million in two small towns in the eastern part of North Carolina.

"The acquisitions have mostly filled gaps in our markets," says Debra Lee,
Triangle's chief financial officer.  "We still consider ourselves a community
bank, and there are a lot of people out there who still want to walk in and
see the place.  That's not saying we're going to open a branch on every
corner, but in our market, we think that's the way to go."

If the track record of the last several years is any indication, there will be
ample demand for branches in 1996.  Many of the outlets put up for sale were
the offspring of in-market mergers, where the selling bank looked to whittle
away some excess capacity once it had completed a major acquisition.  With the
completion of some very large in-market deals like Chase and Chemical Banking
Corp., Fleet Financial Group and Shawmut National Corp., First Chicago Corp.
and NBD, there should be an ample supply of branches in several markets around
the country.

In spite of the demand for some branches, that rapid flurry of consolidation
could create excess supply and cause premiums to fall.  Fifth Third's Niehaus
says he's already seen some evidence of that.

Despite the lower premiums, it seems there will still be plenty of buyers for
brick-and-mortar, no matter how out-of-date some people might consider them.
Old habits die hard-and that's as true for customers as it is for bankers.  As
Triangle's Lee says, "There are still a lot of people who want face-to-face
service."

Industry:  Does Mutuality Offer Longevity?


It's not always easy being a mutual institution, but some mutuals clearly
believe it affords them something important:  a future.

Consider what Staten Island Savings Bank, a large New York mutual, went
through last year when it set its sights on buying a small Staten Island
rival, Gateway State Bank.  The process was something like a dance, says CEO
Harry P.  Doherty-in reality, more like a lurching tango than a minuet.

When executives at the mutual first approached the New York State Banking
Department for approval to buy Gateway, a stock commercial bank, they got a
"you can't do that" reaction.  Pressed as to why not, Doherty relates,
department officials "called back a half-hour later" to say they couldn't find
anything in the statutes to stop it, but a mutual buying a stock company just
"had never been done before."

The deal did get done at 1.5 times book, adding about $300 million to the
savings bank's asset base, now $1.7 billion.  Doherty says some Gateway
stockholders were perplexed that they'd be getting cash and not stock-in fact,
a few even asked if the closing could be delayed past Jan.  1 for tax reasons.
It wasn't.

Doherty insists SISB plans to remain a mutual.  As a stock institution, "we
wouldn't last long," he says, alluding to "the life expectancy of a mayfly."
For those who aren't fisherman or entomologists, the adult mayfly usually
expires within 48 hours.  An exaggeration, perhaps, but worth noting.

Commentary/ Trust:  Preparing for The Prudent Investor Rule


The law of investment management for fiduciaries is in the midst of a major
revision.  The change is based on a revolution in financial theory which has
long been embraced by the markets, but until recently ignored by the law.

The Prudent Man Rule is gradually being replaced by a new statutory standard,
the Prudent Investor Rule.  The new rule is intended to free fiduciaries from
rigid and outdated investment practices and to allow them to use the full
array of tools available in the modern investment world for the selection and
management of an investment portfolio.

The cost of this freedom is a greater responsibility in the selection and
management of portfolios.  The fiduciary must make those selections that are
appropriate for each particular trust.  What is prudent for one trust may be
imprudent for another.  The new rule is liberating in many respects but more
demanding in others than the old rule.  The prudent fiduciary and its legal
advisers must therefore have a full understanding of the broad ramifications
of this revision.

The revision is intended to bring trust law into accordance with the practice
of the investment management industry generally, which has been shaped by four
decades of important academic research as to the optimal methods of investment
management.  These theories and insights are generally referred to as "modern
portfolio theory."  At least 11 states have enacted some version of the
Prudent Investor Rule, as shaped by the American Law Institute in its 1992
Restatement (Third) of Trusts, and the National Conference of Commissioners on
State Laws in its 1994 Uniform Prudent Investor Act (UPIA).  They are:
California, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Utah, Washington, New
York, Illinois and Florida.  It is expected that most other states will soon
move to this standard as well.

Modern Portfolio Theory

Two of the cornerstones of modern portfolio theory can be reduced to timeless
adages.  "Nothing ventured, nothing gained" emphasizes that the other side of
risk is reward.  The market offers bigger rewards (and penalties) for the
unknown than for predictability.  "Don't put all your eggs in one basket"
emphasizes the critical importance of diversification of investments.

Under modern portfolio theory, economists and sophisticated market
participants look at risk differently than the traditional prudent fiduciary
investor.  Risk is a recognition of the uncertainty of future values.  It is a
two-sided coin with an upside and a downside.

The theory assumes that all investors desire the highest possible level of
return while bearing the lowest amount of risk.  Economists assume a certain
baseline for risk-free investors-the return on U.S.  Government securities.
Since the Treasury rate can be had without risk, the market forces an
additional return for the assumption of risk beyond Treasury risk.  An
investor cannot beat this return unless he is willing to assume an additional
level of risk.  Risk appetites will vary according to the circumstances, but
no one gets rich investing at the risk-free Treasury rate.  While assuming
risk does not guarantee riches, it is the only means for an investor to
participate in market returns greater than the baseline.

Modern portfolio theory is concerned not with risk alone but with the
relationship between risk and reward.  Investors must inject an element of
risk into their investments in order to be successful.  Since the market
compensates investors for accepting greater risk, investors will therefore
search for those opportunities which offer the greatest reward relative to the
risk assumed.  While investors must accept the risk of a particular investment
in order to have the opportunity to gain the compensation for such risk, a
portfolio of diversified investments has less overall risk than a single
investment.  Diversification reduces the overall variability of the
performance-which is to say, risk-of an investment portfolio since investments
tend not to all react the same if selected to minimize covariance.

Covariance is the tendency of certain investments to behave the same.  A crash
of technology stocks is likely to drag down most technology stocks, just as
most technology stocks last fall benefited from a bull market.  A portfolio
composed of a mix of different investments will therefore be more diversified
than one which is concentrated in certain types of investments.  A portfolio
composed of Chrysler, General Motors and Ford will have more covariance than
one composed of Citicorp, General Electric and Coca-Cola.

The focus of modern portfolio theory, then, is on portfolio selection rather
than on individual asset selection.  Diversification is important both within
and across different types of assets.  Risk can be judged only within the
context of the whole portfolio.

The common law rule regarding investment by fiduciaries has historically been
quite restrictive.  Investment in common stocks by fiduciaries is a relatively
new development, having been viewed as per se imprudent until the 1940s.
Until that time fiduciaries were generally restricted by statute to "legal
lists" which specified permissible fixed- income investments.  The collapse of
bond values in the Depression led to the adoption of Prudent Man Rule statutes
in most states.

Interestingly, these statutes were based almost verbatim on the language of an
1830 Massachusetts case, Harvard College v.  Amory:  "In acquiring, investing,
reinvesting, exchanging, retaining, selling, and managing property for the
benefit of another, a fiduciary shall exercise the judgment and care, under
the circumstances then prevailing, which men of prudence, discretion, and
intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not in regard to
speculation but in regard to the permanent disposition of their funds,
considering the probable income as well as the probable safety of their
capital."

While seemingly a timeless statement setting forth a flexible yet accountable
standard, Prudent Man Rule statutes were interpreted by the courts as actually
setting forth a Prudent Trustee standard, in the belief that a Prudent Man
would be justified in taking risks in his own investments that would be
inappropriate for a prudent fiduciary.  Caution and conservative selection of
investments became the hallmarks of the Prudent Man Rule.

The interpretations of the Prudent Man Rule statutes have no tolerance for
speculation.  The old rule emphasizes the duty to "preserve principal" at all
costs.  A loss of capital can have catastrophic consequences for a fiduciary.
A fiduciary can become a guarantor of risky investments, even if it picks many
more winners than losers.  Each investment is considered on its own merits,
without regard to the rest of the portfolio.  Broad categories of investments
are considered as imprudent per se.  A fiduciary investing in growth stocks,
start-ups, options and futures might face a surcharge action if those assets
depreciate.

Under the Prudent Man Rule, delegation of investment authority by a fiduciary
is generally forbidden.  Thus, even if a fiduciary is selected for good
relationship reasons rather than for investment expertise, the fiduciary is
personally responsible for all investment decisions, regardless of his level
of expertise-although he is free to seek advice.

The Prudent Investor Rule

As modern portfolio theory became almost universally accepted in economics and
investment management, the law lagged behind.  In acknowledgement of this
problem, the trust bar began a comprehensive review process that resulted in
the Prudent Investor Rule.  The objective was to articulate a standard which
allows various sound investment strategies, yet is flexible enough to adapt to
the inevitable changes in the markets.  It also imposes a meaningful duty of
prudence and care on fiduciaries, forcing them to take steps to serve the
interests of settlors and beneficiaries rather than relying on traditional
investment practices that had as a principal benefit a safe harbor from
liability for the fiduciary.  Interestingly, the Prudent Investor Rule is in
many ways a return to the flexible standard of the original Harvard College
rule.

The heart of the Prudent Investor Rule is a focus on the portfolio as a whole
rather than on specific investments.  The rule recognizes that the key job of
the fiduciary is to determine the tradeoff between risk and return necessary
to realize the trust objectives.  The rule abolishes categoric restrictions
and disavows the emphasis in prior law on avoiding "speculative" or "risky"
investments.  Delegation is permitted, even encouraged.

The Prudent Investor Rule is a standard of conduct.  Liability is not based on
the performance of investments if the fiduciary takes informed and thorough
actions in its investment selection.  It is process-oriented rather than
result-oriented.  In this sense it is somewhat similar to the business
judgment rule of corporate law.  A process-oriented rule puts a continuous
burden on the fiduciary, who can no longer rely on rules of thumb.  The
fiduciary must analyze each situation and make a decision which is prudent
under the circumstances.  Under the Prudent Investor Rule, there is very
little that is per se prudent or imprudent.  The rule does not, however,
abandon trust law's favor of conservative investing.  It does, however,
require a fiduciary to justify whatever investments it makes, whether in
Treasury bills or derivatives.

The major points of the Prudent Investor Rule statutes are as follows:

* The standard of prudence applies to the trust as a whole rather than
individual investments, with a realization that particular investments that
would have been seen as surchargeable speculations under old law may be
sensible, perhaps even risk-reducing additions to a portfolio viewed as a
whole.  * The overall investment strategy should be based upon risk-and-reward
objectives suitable for the trust.  These objectives will vary widely,
depending on the circumstances in each trust arrangement.  * There is a duty
to diversify unless the fiduciary reasonably determines that it is in the
interests of the beneficiaries not to diversify, taking into account the
purposes and terms of the governing instrument.  * No particular investment is
inherently prudent or imprudent.  * No special status is accorded to original
investments received by the fiduciary, and the fiduciary must review them
within a reasonable time of receipt.  * Delegation is permitted, encouraged
and in some cases required.  The Prudent Investor Rule reverses the Prudent
Man Rule's anti-delegation bias.

Impact on Trust Departments

In many respects, the new rule will not change the decision-making process of
most bank trust departments when determining investments.  Most place
significant emphasis on the diversity of assets in the trust portfolio and try
to balance growth and yield to make their investments meet the needs of all
the trust's beneficiaries.  And most understand that their care in the process
of making choices-and not the actual performance of the assets chosen-is the
basis on which they will be judged.  Furthermore, trust departments are
already familiar with provisions of the Prudent Man Rule statutes that hold
the professional trustee to a higher standard of skill than the
non-professional, a concept carried over to the Prudent Investor Rule as well.

Nevertheless, the Prudent Investor Rule, because of its emphasis on the
portfolio as a whole and on the interplay between risk and reward, is a more
dynamic standard and requires consideration of more factors in making
investment choices.  The fiduciary must determine an investment strategy for
the entire trust portfolio, and be able to justify and document both the
reasonableness of that strategy and the prudence of each investment in light
of that strategy.  The strategy, furthermore, must protect the real value, as
opposed to the historic value, of the trust principal while providing for a
suitable return for the income beneficiary.  As a result, the strategy will
necessarily change over time, depending on changes in the economy, individual
investments and the needs and resources of the trust's beneficiaries.

To ensure that the necessary work has been done to review all the relevant
considerations, trust departments will need to establish consistent procedures
to gather and record basic factual information about the family needs and
finances, not only at the trust's inception, but on an ongoing basis.  The
same applies to general analysis of the economy and performance of the
investments.  Trust instruments will have to be analyzed carefully as to their
terms because powers to invade (or the absence of such powers) and precatory
language will take on heightened meaning under the new standard.  Records
should be maintained of the considerations and decisions resulting in a
particular strategy or investment.

The burdens on a trust department resulting from increased inquiry and
record-keeping may well be offset by the opportunities for increased contact
with family members and their input into the decision-making process.

New Opportunities, New Risks

The Prudent Investor Rule permits and even encourages unsophisticated trustees
to delegate investment decisions to professionals.  As a result, asset
investment departments of banks and trust companies will likely find more call
for their services to individual fiduciaries.

Many fiduciaries also will chose to meet the requirements of diversification
and risk assumption by participating in mutual funds.  In another area, banks
in Prudent Investor Rule states are now providing specific sophisticated
services to trustees, such as risk-management derivatives or review and
oversight of family assets.

There are a great many unknown areas in the application of the Prudent
Investor Rule.  It cannot be predicted how easily the courts will move away
from the more clear-cut standards of the Prudent Man Rule when faced with
actual lawsuits, or how they will reevaluate the fiduciary's decisions years
after they were made.  Other important issues include the extent of the
trustee's duty of affirmative due diligence to inquire about family
circumstances, and the scope of liability of the investment advisor.

In addition, it is not clear how the Prudent Investor Rule interacts with
other existing laws which have not been-and may not be-modified to fit its
concerns.  For example, under-productive property rules in many states require
each asset of a trust to produce a minimum amount of income to avoid
allocation of a portion of that asset's proceeds to the trust's income
beneficiary.  This is not consistent with the total return analysis of the
Prudent Investor Rule.  Other portions of state income and principal acts may
also be troublesome.  Furthermore, the effect of the Prudent Investor Rule on
pension trusts and charitable trusts and corporations that are regulated by
specific state or federal statutes has not been fully explored.  Indeed,
fiduciaries will be acting in a realm of uncertainty for some time to come.

Pushing a Global Brand


On a dank winter day in Red Wing, MN, a woman troops out through a chilly
drizzle to her mailbox and finds, among other mail, a statement from her
credit card company, Citibank.  Included is a notice that her credit limit is
being raised, and a reminder that its purchase protection plan offers price
savings if an item she buys is being sold more cheaply later.

Halfway across the world in steamy Singapore, an export executive returns to
his sleek apartment to find a different Citibank mailing, an offer for a card
tied to a frequent flyer program for Asian travelers.

From Bangkok to Bangor, and sundry points in between, the Citibank credit card
is proving itself to be truly a worldwide brand, with a scope that's sometimes
startling.  Citi issues secured cards and even private-label cards in Brazil,
frequent flyer cards in Argentina and Taiwan.  In many countries, Citibank and
Diners Club-the travel and entertainment card of which Citi is the primary
owner-are the chief consumer card brands.  Citibank processes more than 240
million card payments and has 90 million card customer contacts a year.  Its
overseas executives don't need to brush up on Portuguese or Thai; likely as
not, they're natives.

More than any other American bank-and arguably any bank-Citibank is a name
player in an array of overseas markets.  Long-established operations in Europe
and Latin America weren't shucked off some years ago, the way they were at
several other money center banks when profitability was squeezed.  Under
chairman John S.  Reed, parent Citicorp has made servicing the global consumer
a veritable mantra-and the credit card business is perhaps the biggest weapon
in its arsenal.

It is precisely this unparalleled reach that should keep Citi at the top of
the credit card receivables heap.  Nimble, aggressive issuers like MBNA Corp.,
First USA Inc.  and Advanta Corp.  have used a precision-bombing approach on
top credit targets to build U.S.  market share dramatically, and they'll keep
gaining share-but less so at Citi's expense than other large issuers.  Even if
the New York behemoth finds its domestic lead shrinking, its plethora of
relatively untapped overseas programs-some with explosive growth
potential-should preserve its top ranking.

"We believe that Citicorp is in a unique position to build upon its
multinational credit card experience in entering new markets, dealing with
their cultural differences and developing relevant products-even where credit
bureaus or other information sources are nonexistent," wrote Salomon Brothers
analyst Diane Glossman in a report last fall.

Citi's card operations may be its crown jewel, analysts say; plastic generates
a higher percentage of the bank's earnings than any other bank issuer's cards
do, and accounted for an estimated 29% of the bank's net income in
third-quarter 1995, according to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.  It's a jewel cut
and honed by many years of large-scale marketing, telephone account servicing
and experimentation with differing offers.  Citi was among the pioneers in the
purchase protection plan area, as well as extended warranties.  Its
Citidollars program, offering catalog items to customers as a form of rebates,
also broke new ground years ago.

In the spring of 1994, this gem was placed in the hands of Roberta J.  Arena,
a 20-year Citi veteran who had most recently headed Citi's relatively small
European card operations.  As executive vice president in charge of the North
American and European card group, Arena replaced James L.  Bailey, the bank's
longtime card honcho.  Citibank declined to make Arena available for an
interview for this story, but industry observers say her experience outside
the U.S.  is underscoring Citi's commitment to pushing its global strategy
even further.

At a time when headlines in the U.S.  are trumpeting worries about mounting
consumer credit troubles, foreign markets may offer a useful counterweight.
Historically, Citicorp's card-loss numbers have been slightly worse than
industry averages because of its targeting of what Glossman calls "a
high-risk, high-return clientele."  Citi's U.S.  loss experience, however, has
changed little; at 3.72% of managed card receivables in the third quarter, it
actually improved two basis points from the second quarter and was up just 15
basis points from third-quarter 1994.

Moreover, KBW research finds that cards represented just over half of Citi's
net chargeoffs in the third quarter-53%-compared to 74% at Bank of New York,
75% at Chemical Bank, 87% at Chase Manhattan and 99% at First Chicago.  Still,
Citi has been boosting its provision for credit losses in the global consumer
bank.  That item hit $465 million in the third quarter, up $100 million from
the year-earlier number.

Credit the bank with seeing the trendlines.  "As the largest credit card
issuer in the country, we think it will be impossible for Citicorp to avoid
concerns about credit cards' credit quality," noted PaineWebber's Lawrence
Cohn in a recent report.

Citi's card prominence dates to the virtual dawn of the bank card in the early
1970s, and at this juncture its card is a very mature product in this country.
There's a bit of consumer ennui about the brand, perhaps, which will be a
challenge for Arena and her marketing forces.  So, too, will be catering to
the more service-savvy customer and finding the proper alchemy of rates and
rewards to keep profitability high amid fierce competitive pressures.

The legacy of leadership is certainly there.  "They reached a milestone in the
late 1970s when they realized that the card was the beachhead of least
resistance," says a consultant who worked for the bank years ago.  "They gave
up trying to be a national bank.

"Very early on, they decided the card business should be done on a volume
basis," he adds, and began multimillion-piece mailings.  "Even though Citi was
realizing significantly higher loan losses than the industry norms, by going
after active credit users, where the profits are, they were making more
because those people aren't as sensitive to rates and fees.  (Citi) accepted
credit losses as a cost of goods sold.  They also realized that they had a
great list, and they crammed everything they could sell down that pipeline."

Reputation as a Bully

"Cram" implies an element of bullying-and Citicorp still occasionally gets
demonized by consumer groups and smaller banks as the apotheosis of impersonal
service and a Marie Antoinette-in-pinstripes, "let-them-eat-cake" response to
criticism.  Some of that reflects a kind of Jeffersonian revulsion to bigness,
but Citi earned a lot of enmity in thev '70s and '80s, when it seemed eager to
bulldoze any regulation or law in its path.

But a seemingly chastened Citi-burned by waves of LDC, leveraged buyout and
commercial real estate losses in the late '80s and early '90s-is keeping a
lower profile these days.  It's no longer the merger scourge that smaller
banks once saw in their nightmares; institutions like NationsBank Corp.  and
First Union Corp.  have taken over that mantle.  As Citi has turned right
full-rudder into consumer banking, it's often been reducing fees (especially
for electronic services), not just jacking them up.

If Citi's consumer banking business isn't hitting on all cylinders, it's
close:  It generated over $500 million in global earnings in the third
quarter, a new high-water mark and 60% of the company's net income.  That's
broad-based, but the credit card is the biggest arrow in the quiver.  Citi
reported 56 million cards in circulation at the end of the third quarter, up
9% from the year earlier, with managed receivables up 19%.  Growth was
especially strong in the Asia-Pacific region, where managed receivables surged
40%, year-to-year, and applications hit a record level.  Since 1990, worldwide
cards in force have swelled more than 50%.

It's a big business, Citicorp's largest, and it requires hordes of
people-6,400 alone in three service centers in South Dakota, Maryland and
Nevada (Citi has offered 24-hour, 7-day phone service for almost a decade).
Throw in the operations in 31 other countries, and 14,300 employees are
involved-more bodies than the entire workforce at most large regional banks.

It's hard to downplay scale and experience in a business like credit cards.
In a recent survey of senior bank executives and directors by Towers Perrin,
Citibank was named most often as the best product manufacturer and distributor
in banking-attributes at the heart of card programs.  "The fact that Citi has
played at this level year in and year out is a remarkable thing," says Angelo
Palombi, senior executive vice president at Resource Bancshares Corp., a
Columbia, SC, firm that helps smaller banks run card operations.

For many years, Citi has been using scoring and portfolio modeling, then
blanketing the country with mail pieces, often with pre-approved applications
based on statistics and credit report data.  True, Citi doesn't know the
customer in Oshkosh as well as the local bank, and never will.  But the credit
card business is a scale-enhanced one in which it's increasingly impractical
to lend just locally.  Think Advanta and MBNA aren't using sophisticated
credit scoring techniques?  Think again.  Citi is using its technological
prowess to segment its marketing efforts and boost responsiveness, as well as
build average card balances.

With $42.1 billion in receivables at the end of 1995's third quarter, Citi's
program was half again as large as second-place Discover's $28.2 billion,
according to RAM Research.  MBNA, First USA and First Chicago rounded out the
top five (see table on this page).  Citi held 23.4% of total receivables for
the 10 largest issuers.

Several money-center analysts put its return on assets on its U.S.  card
business around 2.5%.  KBW's Berry says the business "continues to generate
superior returns," though Salomon Brothers' Glossman predicts returns will
trend down toward 2.0% over time.  That 2.5% ROA is double what aggressive
"pure-play" issuers Capital One Financial Corp.  (1.20%) and Advanta (about
1.30% on receivables made up 80% of credit cards) reported in the third
quarter.  Revenues would be even more impressive if Citi could develop better
cross-sell numbers; only 6% of the card base has another Citibank
relationship, and only half of branch customers have a Citi card, says
Glossman.

Profitability has received renewed attention, and that seems to be paying off.
"Historically, they were more aggressive and more sophisticated than any other
issuers," says K.  Shelly Porges, president of Porges/Hudson Marketing in San
Francisco.  But "they did not focus exclusively on revolving customers (those
who carry balances)-that would have made them more profitable.  They were out
there to gain total share."

Citi clearly isn't as dominant as it was a few years ago.  Its share of U.S.
credit card receivables slipped from 18% in 1991 to 13.5% at the end of 1994,
according to Credit Card Management, a Faulkner & Gray publication.  RAM
numbers put its Sept.  30, 1995 share even lower, at 12.8%.

Yet it's hard to underplay the importance of cards in Citi's earnings stream.
The bank reported 24.8 million bank card accounts in September 1995, and card
loans made up 23% of Citi's bankwide loans, up from 21% a year earlier; only
First Chicago (41%) had a higher percentage among major bank issuers.

Visa and MasterCard cards make up the vast majority of those accounts, but
Citi has issued some seven million Diners Club cards, and also issues and
services millions of private-label cards for department stores.  In the 1950s,
Diners was the travel and entertainment card for U.S.  corporations.  That's a
distinction it has lost-American Express is now six times as large, worldwide.
But Diners recorded its fourth straight record sales year in 1994, with
worldwide revenues of $22 billion in more than 175 countries.

Citi's ownership of the 45-year-old Diners brand is complex-Citi may have
control in various countries or share it with local franchisees.  It owns the
franchise in Germany, for instance, but In Chile has only a 20% share.  Diners
claims relationships with more than half of the Fortune 500 corporations, but
skeptics say it lives more on its past reputation than anything, and has more
clout in Europe in Asia than in the U.S.  "They haven't exploited Diners to
the point they can," says Michael Auriemma, president of Auriemma Consulting
in Westbury, NY.  "The energy and the effort seem to be missing."

But Porges points out that Citi has been developing new marketing for Diners-a
clear sign that it is committed to the program.  New commercials feature
younger, hipper travelers and an updated focus on women, she says.  In a
recent full-page ad in major newspapers, Diners takes on American Express,
calling Diners' "membership miles" program superior because it includes "every
major U.S.  airline"-including two Amex leaves out.

Big Switch

Analysts attribute Citi's relative passivity on the marketing front in 1991-93
to its internal problems, many related to real estate loan losses.  That was
also a period when Citi's card chargeoffs peaked, climbing to over 6% in
1991-92, according to KBW.  Yet card profits, as well as those from other
consumer businesses, helped pull the bank from the ditch it had landed in five
years ago.

The 1992 switch to variable rates and the year-end 1993 decision to eliminate
annual fees for Citibank Classic and Preferred Visa and MasterCard customers
with good credit histories sacrificed what some analysts estimated was
hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues.  But it clearly gave Citi's card
program a shot in the arm.  "Repricing is restoring our momentum," Arena
announced in 1994.  In an interview last year with Brandweek magazine, she
said, "We invested more than we had planned in sheer marketing last year
(1994)...  so I think it's fair to say that we are back."

In its latest annual report, Citi said the steps were taken "to reinforce its
market dominance by building customer loyalty in this highly competitive
market."  Adding customers was a key objective.  Early in 1995, for instance,
the bank was offering new customers an introductory fixed rate of 6.9% for 12
months, considerably longer than most rivals.

Frank DeSantis, money-center analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, adds
that Citi has identified active customers who have $50 billion in balances on
other issuers' cards-and is targeting these accounts with balance-transfer
solicitations.  Its goal, he says, "is to regain half its lost market share
over the next five years."  Earlier last year, DeSantis singled out Citi's
usage levels, citing the figure of 79% of all accounts active (vs.  66%
industrywide) and higher-than-average balances per active account, $2,150 vs.
the $1,750 industry average.  Moreover, he says that the company's credit card
expense control "borders on spectacular"-recently, it was operating at a 34%
efficiency ratio in the U.S.

Citi has been "coming to terms with things that were part of its heritage,"
says Porges.  Citidollars, for instance, which was discontinued a year and a
half ago.  When it was introduced in the early '80s, Citidollars "had a lot of
power," she says.  "But in an age of co-branded cards, Citidollars had little
if any appeal."

The U.S.  portfolio has been highly segmented, offering consumers an array of
choices:  Classic (security and value); Preferred (higher credit line);
Choice, for price-sensitive buyers; and co-branded programs with such major
partners as American Airlines, Ford Motor Co.  and Apple Computer.  Another
successful selling strategy is the Photocard, in which the cardholder's photo
is digitally imprinted on the face of the card-a genuine security advantage
that Citi says cut its U.S.  bank card fraud losses by 62% in 1993-94.
Introduced in the U.S.  in 1992, it has been rolled out in all European,
Asia-Pacific and Latin American markets.

But the bank has hit a few pockets of major turbulence, too.  Its co-branded
card with MCI Communications was killed last year when consumers just didn't
line up.  And the Ford card, announced with a flourish three years ago, is
rumored in the industry to have collected most of its accounts from elsewhere
in Citi's empire, not from new customers.

Some attribute those difficulties to a focus on Citi's own brand, giving
co-branding programs-in which the bank shares proceeds with a nonbank-a lower
priority.  "The focus on the brand is an excellent strategy, but I think for
something that large they should have a two-pronged approach," says Auriemma.
"They're not focusing on some of the non-branded programs that might have
tremendous potential."

Great Expectations

Where issuers like MBNA and Household Bank have had tremendous success with
co-branded programs, the only one that has really clicked at Citi is the
American Airlines frequent flyer, or AAdvantage, experts say.  It's done so
well that it's been exported throughout Latin America.  But the other
programs?

"The Apple program ought to be huge, but I don't know one person that carries
(that card)," Auriemma says.  Similarly, he says never got an MCI card
solicitation, even though he was an MCI customer; he believes that's because
Citi is concentrating on its branded cards in the greater New York market.
Says Porges:  "When we talk about success in co-branding, the expectation is
that (Citi) would have something as big or bigger than anyone else's.  By that
standard, they weren't successful."  She quickly adds that this doesn't mean
the programs are failures, however.

On the flip side, Citi's own brand recognition is a huge asset-and coupled
with the bank's far-flung presence, it offers breathtaking potential.  Citi
issues bank cards in Belgium, Germany, Greece and Spain-and believes a
co-branded arrangement with the German national railway could catapult it to
first place there.  Plans are to consolidate the 15 card processing and
customer service facilities in North America and Europe into a small core of
centralized operations, trimming costs.

Asia, where Citi has a stronger presence than any other American bank, is its
most turbocharged card market.  Four million cards are in force there, and
Citi recently partnered with Passages, Asia's biggest frequent-flyer program,
in seven countries.  Arena has said that the credit card "is the biggest
introductory agent we have for the (Citibank) brand."

Even Eastern Europe, where capital infrastructures are still being built from
the rubble of Communism, holds card potential-though it may be a ways off.
Citi is in such countries as the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Russia.
Salomon Brothers' Glossman noted in a recent report that Citi's Eastern
European operations "have been profitable from day one...  These economies
tend to be almost completely cash-dependent, and Citicorp is well-positioned
should development skip checks and move straight to credit/debit/stored value
cards."

Some observers wonder just how quickly these emerging markets can deliver,
however.  "It is important to develop them, but those markets are so small and
so immature that to spend a significant portion of management time on them is
dangerous, I think," Auriemma says.  "You certainly wouldn't want to do it to
the detriment of the U.S.  market."

Even in many highly developed areas in western Europe, there's plenty of
opportunity.  A New York banker with close ties to a large Dutch bank says
that many bankers there don't understand the popularity of credit cards in
this country; there, they've focused far more on debit cards-leaving an
autobahn-like opening for a high-volume card issuer like Citi.

In a number of overseas markets, Citi doesn't have to import its U.S.  card
logic, notes John Laurino, managing director at Westport Consulting in
Westport, CT.  "It has built retail businesses from the ground up, and they
are as well-established as they are in the States."  In fact, some of its
products in this country "were explored and validated overseas and brought
back here."  Citi calls that process "success transfer."

Success isn't necessarily measured in terms of customer satisfaction, however.
Citi tied for fifth in a recent U.S.  card satisfaction survey by J.D.  Power
& Co., long noted for its automotive surveys.  Power measured such attributes
as billing payment quality, interest rates, rewards and fees, cash advance
limits and point-of-sale processing quality.  Citi's score of 101-100 was
deemed average-tied it with Banc One.  Only one multiline bank scored higher,
Bank of New York at 102.  AT&T Universal Card led the pack, followed by
Discover and Household Bank.

In a RAM rating of the "best" consumer cards, Citi doesn't score in the top
group in any category except "best secured cards," where it was third behind
Wachovia Corp.  and Chase Manhattan.  But its move to eliminate annual fees
helps boost consumer satisfaction-though Citi, like most fee-charging issuers,
was dragged into those waters by a horde of no-fee rivals who were clearly
making big inroads.

Service Questions

Service quality issues remain, some customers say.  One customer with a
Citigold account-a packaged account that requires an opening minimum of
$100,000 and brings with it such goodies as a personal account officer, funds
sweep and trading privileges-complains that he's had difficulty with the bank
acknowledging separate accounts.  When he ran over his limit on a plain
vanilla card, he says, the card service people apparently never realized he
was a Citigold customer.  "From a customer perspective, (the card business)
seems to be managed autonomously from the retail bank," he says.  That
experience highlights the difficulty of managing information over massive
networks, but for an institution with Citi's technological prowess, it's
disconcerting nonetheless.

Technology does appear to be paying dividends, however, in keeping
delinquencies and losses in line.  As consumer loan delinquencies have shot up
in recent months, Citi's numbers have held up well.  Moreover, Lehman Brothers
analyst James Rosenberg maintains that even if Citi's U.S.  consumer
chargeoffs (including cards) jumped 100 basis points, that would extract at
most a 10% toll on earnings.  Similarly, KBW's Berry notes that Citi's $1.8
billion in consumer loan-loss reserves (most allocated for card losses)
represented 17 months of recent losses-far more than the seven months'
reserves that specialty card banks usually carry.

But it's incontrovertible:  cards are riskier than, say, home equity loans.
Citi's overall loss rate of 2.02% for all managed consumer loans at the
third-quarter close compares to 3.78% for worldwide credit card loans.

Risk management is a tough nut for issuers, and so is consumer loyalty at a
time of intense competition on the issuer's version of the Three R's:  rates,
rebates and rewards.  It's estimated that a record three billion credit card
offers were mailed out in 1995 alone.  "In the last 10 years, customer loyalty
to credit cards (in the U.S.)  has been destroyed, as holders were saturated
with offers," says Robert Skolnick, executive vice president at Behavioral
Analysis Inc.  in Tarrytown, NY.  "Issuers have turned credit cards into a
commodity in consumers' minds, and now they are launching major efforts to
develop long-term relationships, which historically had been presumed."

That's every major issuers' story; it is Citi's, too.  Growth potential in
this country is circumscribed by such commoditization, but it isn't strangled,
especially if current cardholders can be coaxed to build their balances.
Berry thinks Citi's card program can maintain its domestic share even as
overall credit card receivables mount at a 14%-16% annual clip through the
rest of the decade.  Roping in a new group-maybe even a new generation-of
customers is a key cog in that effort.

Arena told Brandweek that the student market is one of Citi's four major
marketing thrusts, the others being high-end spenders, "new Americans" and
"the great magic middle," which she said "is best characterized as being
married, or something, with children."  That great middle, she added, is where
Citi is "focusing our marketing weight."

In developing markets, far from the U.S.' saturated shores, growth could be
comparatively luxuriant.  "Adding new countries, improving penetration in
existing countries and increased usage of credit cards as a payment vehicle in
the locations are all sources of growth," wrote Glossman recently.  "Citicorp
already has enviable positioning in many of these markets with a known brand
name and the ability to draw upon its U.S.  and international skill base."
For instance, Citi recently introduced its American AAdvantage card in four
new markets-Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Panama.

Obviously, the developing world offers risk with a capital "R."  But Glossman,
who has exhaustively analyzed the bank's card operations, offers an
instructive example of Citi's experience in Colombia.  While savings banks
there have seen delinquency rates shoot as high as 25%, Citi's recently stood
at 4.4%.  Citi "has the advantage of centralized scoring, collections and more
targeted marketing," she noted.  One result:  Citi grew its credit card book
in Colombia by 116% in the first half of 1995, she says.

No Alarm Bells

Domestically, Citi can expect to see a modest uptick in delinquencies if
current trends hold-but nothing alarming.  Card executives at other banks
don't profess serious concern.  "Our forecasted losses are within our
expectations," says John A.  Klein, executive vice president for consumer
banking at People's Bank in Bridgeport, CT, which has a national low-rate
portfolio.  "They continue to track in a way we would expect with the
vintaging of our account base."

Another executive with a regional issuer attributes today's delinquency rise
more to the economic cycle than to a lack of portfolio "seasoning" over time.
"We're seeing people claiming bankruptcy who are not even past due.  That debt
is not showing up at the credit bureaus."  Still, he says that "most
successful players don't stop issuing in these markets, and the big guys like
Citicorp know that."

What's driving the most successful operations in this era of card saturation
is the ability to assemble information electronically and use it to maintain
the most profitable customer relationships, says James Quella, head of the
financial services practice at Mercer Management Consulting.  Citi continues
to reinvest heavily in the card business, adding client-server and voice
response technologies, and Glossman insists its current cost-per-account level
is what it was in 1982.  In a 1993 study by Booz, Allen & Hamilton, Citi's
cost advantage in the back office over other major card players ranged from
10% to 60%.

An executive with a regional card issuer says he heard that a few years ago,
Citi explored a mutual opening of back offices with First Data Corp.  Such
overtures, in which companies check out each other's technology, don't always
lead to ventures, and he says "Citi is notorious for stealing ideas."  After
that process, he says, "Citi felt it had perhaps the best cost structure" in
the business.  Being a low-cost producer has conferred tremendous advantages
by freeing up resources for new marketing and technology initiatives.

While Citi hasn't been duking it out in the courts far and wide as it was in
the 1970s and 1980s, it isn't loath to fight to protect its interests.  The
bank recently challenged a New Jersey law limiting late fees to $10 per card
account each month; Citi charges its customers $15.  The New Jersey Supreme
Court upheld the state limit in late November, and Citi immediately vowed to
appeal.

It's clear that Citi doesn't have the pre-eminent role it once did in the card
business; too many other talented players have come in.  But Citi is no Norma
Desmond, either, living only on past glories.  Freed from its earlier asset
woes and focused on the global consumer, it is in the process of erecting a
worldwide brand it hopes will rival Coca-Cola or Hewlett-Packard.

When that exporter in Singapore weighs his options for a card, that name
recognition and the image of Citi's four-pointed star will be no small
consideration.  So, too, will it weigh considerably with a manufacturing
executive in Germany.  Citi expects to grow its European card business to five
million accounts by 2000, from one million now, adding a new country every
12-15 months.  Since Arena's elevation, "They're taking a more global view of
the business," says Porges.  "Even though they talked global, the focus was on
the U.S.  My sense is there's a truer commitment now to non-U.S.  expansion."

That will require plenty of bodies and minds, and rivals won't be sitting
still.  But analysts see only encouraging signs.  You can't say the Citi never
slips, but it's spinning its wheels a lot less these days.  Pumped up by
global branding, its credit card business is like a battleship:  It may not be
nimble, but it has loads of firepower and a very long reach.

U.S. BANKER via NewsNet
JANUARY, 1996

Final Say:  CEOs Key to Sales Process


Banking's best CEOs and business unit managers have a passion for selling and
a well-defined process for managing sales.  They treat great selling as one of
their few sustainable strategic advantages.

At one of the nation's best-performing large banking groups, the president
makes over 300 sales calls a year and meets regularly with field sales
managers.  At another high-performing bank, the senior retail banking
executive personally coaches every one of his 120 retail salespeople in
selling for an hour each quarter as a model for his managers to follow.

Most bank CEOs are comfortable with selling, or they wouldn't have achieved so
much career success.  But often they're uncomfortable with the time required
to manage sales or with the functional skills of sales leadership, such as
sales planning and coaching.  As a result, they're often persuaded to champion
easy, non-integrated solutions to sales problems, such as single-event
programs that require little interdepartmental cooperation.  That's why most
bank sales programs aren't working.

Examples of traditional bank sales practices that don't work include the
industry's popular cross-sell measures, product sales incentives and officer
call programs.  These typically focus managers on activity rather than on
effectiveness.  Similarly, the structure and detail of activity-driven sales
training and mystery shopper programs make CEOs feel that a lot is being done
to increase sales and customer satisfaction, despite any hard evidence.

These "quick fixes" have actually encouraged formulaic selling and
product-pushing and have relieved managers of their sense of accountability.
None of those "easy" sales interventions by themselves can provide the focus,
motivation and accountability that's provided by a fully integrated sales
process.  Most line sales managers in banking know these traditional sales
programs aren't working, but few will say so aloud because so much money and
senior management prestige is invested in them.

Sales effectiveness begins at the top of the organization chart.  Research at
Harvard Business School has established that having a clear sales task is the
most important factor in sales motivation, coupled with feedback and
accountability.  If this is true, only the CEO and other senior executives can
influence large gains in sales production.

If a CEO doesn't communicate a clear vision of success and clear role
definitions for selling or doesn't hold line managers accountable for sales
revenue and developing salespeople through coaching, this lack of clarity
filters down through the bank.  Employees lose their motivation, and average
sales revenue per employee falls.  Repeated surveys of bank salespeople have
demonstrated that bank employees don't know what they're supposed to do
relative to sales and customer satisfaction.  They also say they're receiving
virtually no coaching, no feedback and no meaningful consequences for
performance, good or bad.

For a bank to make a quantum leap in sales, its employees must believe that
senior managers are placing a consistent focus and priority on sales and
customer satisfaction.

A Simple Answer

With so many banks failing at sales, what are the CEOs of successful
organizations doing to produce outstanding results?  The answer is
surprisingly simple:  Banking's best CEOs treat sales as a primary business
function, giving it the same commitment and attention to detail that they give
to pricing and expense control.

Banking's best sales organizations show a sense of urgency and accountability
for sales production and customer satisfaction that isn't present at other
banks.  This is driven by the CEO's uncompromising insistence that sales
revenue contributions and customer satisfaction be considered as key factors
in decisions affecting all functional areas of the bank.

This means that improvement in sales revenue and customer satisfaction are
measured and rewarded; that sales and customer satisfaction are key agenda
items for senior level management meetings; and that the CEO and business unit
managers are visible in articulating clear goals, strategies and preferred
ways of selling, and in serving as models of personal selling and sales
coaching.  None of this is rocket science, but it is increasingly clear that
active sales leadership by the CEO pays dividends and helps improve prospects
for long-term survival.

Funding:  Those Dwindling Deposits


Like a pond drawn down by drought, the nation's depository institutions are
finding their deposit bases shrinking as consumers take their savings money
elsewhere.  To some observers, this phenomenon has gone beyond a cyclical
event dictated by rate movements-and has profound repercussions on the future
of bank funding.

"The (core) deposits are not going to come back," says Michael Brosnan,
director of the Treasury and market risk division at the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).  "In my opinion, this is not a short-term
phenomenon; this is a secular change in the system.  The question is, are you
planning this out, or is it just happening to you?"

A recent study of this phenomenon by Charles N.  Cranmer, director of equity
research at New York broker/dealer M.A.  Shapiro & Co.  Inc., establishes
clearly that at best, core deposits at the nation's banks are stagnant, while
the low-cost deposit categories are experiencing significant run-offs as
depositors search for higher yields.  Illiquid assets as a percent of core
liabilities, the standard for liquidity in Cranmer's study, have jumped from
84% in year-end 1993 to 95% in the second quarter of 1995.

And according to data from the OCC, deposits of all sorts have declined in the
past three years, and are flat to significantly lower compared with 1990 (see
charts).  Most dramatically, all time deposits in the nation's commercial
banks fell from 31.74% of total assets in mid-1990 to 22.37% in mid-1995.  In
the same period, small time deposits fell from 20.07% to 16.43% of total
assets, while large time deposits fell from 11.67% to 5.94%.

Experts say that consumer flight to higher yields isn't the only cause.  Many
banks are rationalizing their branch systems and finding that core deposits
gathered through them aren't always the cheapest way to go.

"I think what's happened is that as banks have acquired robust information
systems, they've come to appreciate the fully-loaded costs of acquiring
certain deposits and have become less enamored of them, because it may
actually be expensive money," says Chris Formant, a Boston-based national
partner in the financial services group of Coopers & Lybrand Consulting.

But this phenomenon naturally sends the nation's banks into the capital
markets for money to lend, raising the cost of funds-and squeezing margins.
And while the industry as a whole is awash in capital today, says Cranmer, it
doesn't mean the subject is so boring that bankers can safely look the other
way.  Analysts certainly aren't.  In a recent report on First Bank System,
Citicorp fixed-rate analyst Blaine Frantz wrote that "available balance sheet
liquidity to fund loan growth is the most noteworthy constraint on the bank's
credit profile."

"If American bankers continue ignoring this (liquidity issue), one day they'll
get caught with their pants down," Cranmer says.  "People don't talk much
about liquidity, but these days, the Japanese banks have to pay 100 basis
points over the yield curve for funds, and I'm sure they wish they didn't have
to do that."

Japanese banks, which don't have as well-developed an asset securitization
market as U.S.  banks, have reportedly endured significant outflows of foreign
deposits in recent months as news of their deep-seated problems has surfaced.
These outflows have forced them into the arms of professional-and
skeptical-financiers.

A similar fate, say experts, awaits complacent U.S.  bankers who think they
can safely ignore balance sheet basics, and concentrate on the glamorous side
of the business, because they imagine that the bad old days of write-downs and
microscopic bank examinations are over.  This is exactly what will cause the
next liquidity crunch if banks don't pay more attention, says Roy Smith,
professor of finance at New York University's Stern School of Business.

"The real problem (today) isn't on the liquidity side-banks are
over-capitalized today," he says.  "The problem is, what are banks doing with
their capital?  And they're doing two things; buying other banks and paying
high prices, or squandering it on some of the syndicated loans they're
making."

"They just want to look good in the locker room," he continues.  "If they're
willing to take 11 basis points from a British conglomerate, they're surely
not covering the risks of that loan being degraded; that's a lower spread over
LIBOR than they got for some of the loans that went bad in the 1980s," he
says, citing a recently syndicated loan.

To a great extent, what is replacing the core deposits as an important source
of liquidity at the nation's depository institutions is no mystery.  Most
larger banks today are deeply into securitization and outright asset sales,
and are familiar figures at the Fed funds window and in the nation's money
markets.

As a result, most experts feel that while keeping an eye on liquidity is at
the very least well-advised, they also say that focussing on illiquid assets
as a percent of core assets as a liquidity measurement as closely as Cranmer
does in his study is too narrow.  "When I look at liquidity, I can't look at a
single ratio," says the OCC's Brosnan.  "I look at (borrowing) capacity, as
well as asset quality issues, management issues, and the stability of
earnings.  To the extent that these things, and capital, are solid, we're
happy."

There are important cost, regulatory and accounting issues, often unremarked,
that are driving the turning of U.S.  banks to securitization and asset sales
as a source of liquidity.  The cost of operating a branch system to gather
deposits, for instance, is a largely hidden, but real cost.  Also, says the
OCC's Brosnan, securitization improves a bank's capital position.  "You get to
fund off-balance sheet, and get a continually growing earnings stream without
raising capital by a proportional amount."

Auto loans, for instance, must be reserved against at an 8% rate, while
securitizing such a loan requires no reserves and releases that 8% to the bank
to re-lend, explains Brosnan.  But since earnings from securitizations and
asset sales flow to non-interest income on a company's annual report, it's
difficult to measure directly the impact of that activity on the bank's
liquidity position.

Cranmer doesn't disagree with this analysis.  "Securitization is a pretty
powerful force on the consumer side of the market, and a clear alternative" to
core deposits, he says.  "To the extent you're creating internally generated
funds, that's liquidity.  But while a company that's leveraged one-to-one or
even two-to-one can fund most of its needs internally, a company that's
leveraged 20-to-one never can."

The growth of these sophisticated financings have allowed bankers to likewise
become much more sophisticated in their use of the capital markets,
derivatives and risk management, which is leading them away from a reliance on
core deposits as a primary source of liquidity, says Cooper & Lybrand's
Formant.  And as a result, core deposit levels don't really reflect a bank's
true liquidity.

Approaching Obsolescence

"I think it's becoming an obsolete measurement," he says.  "Not completely
obsolete; but the stated composition of a bank's superficial liquidity and
matching funds may not be what it really is, if you look at some of the
off-balance sheet financings, and some of the derivatives, which may change
the composition of that liquidity."

The issue, then, isn't whether banks have money to lend, but how they get it.
"The real measure of liquidity is, what's the quality of the bank, and how are
people looking at it?"  says the OCC's Brosnan.

There's the rub; market perception.  When a bank turns from core deposits to
the money markets for much of their liquidity, everything depends on how it's
viewed on the trading floor.  And while securitization, and professional
markets, are perfectly reasonable venues for liquidity when properly managed,
they can also turn on borrowers like tigers, in a sort of extremely grown-up
version of high school popularity.

For a domestic example of how fast a good thing can go bad, look no further
than Continental Illinois Corp., say observers.  Once one of the nation's
premier banks, Continental Illinois was prevented under Illinois regulations
from having a branch system, and therefore direct access to stable core
deposits.  The result was that it had to fund itself in the money markets
every day, to the tune of billions of dollars.

Of course, other Chicago banks had to do the same, and prospered.  But in
1984, a connected series of events led to its being solvent on a Friday and
broke next Monday.  Headlines and a federal reorganization inevitably
followed.

Nightmares like that can be useful in keeping bankers from a terminal case of
complacency, but they're also easy to ignore, especially as the tides of
financial fashion sweep from coast to coast.  That, says Cranmer, is why now
is a good time to buttress a bank's balance sheet.

"There's always a credit cycle, and when times are good, you want to build
your balance sheet in anticipation of the next down cycle," he says.  He
advises bank to stop relying so much on overnight Fed funds and to stagger
maturities, so that a bank isn't caught one day carrying both a big market
basket and a low credit rating.

Sounds like common sense.  But are banks doing this?  Not really, says
Cranmer.  "The whole criticism I have of the industry overall, is that they're
tending to short-fund themselves.  It does cost more money to issue five-year
bank notes than to borrow overnight Fed funds, but the difference is only 50
basis points."

"This is something banks haven't really had to face up to, because they could
always fund with their core deposits," Cranmer adds.  "But they want to
accommodate their long-term customers and they want to go to the closing
dinners and they want to sit at the lead table.  There are all sorts of
motivations; it just doesn't seem to me that a lot of the syndicated loans
banks are making these days are real economical."

If this has a certain unhappily familiar ring to it, NYU's Professor Smith is
unsurprised-and unmoved.

"The premium in banking, as always, goes to those who know what they're doing,
and understand the problems they face, and don't squander their funds on
badly-priced loans just to gain some sort of ephemeral leadership in a market
that may not matter to them," he says.  "What they ought to be doing is
asking, 'How are we going to compete in the retail market with the mutual
funds, and how are we going to compete in the wholesale markets with the
investment banks?'"

Good questions, of course, and critical for the big picture.  But lending and
spread management are the bread-and-butter of banking.  Unless the entire
notion of banking is revolutionized, banks need to be occupied with funding
issues.  Core deposits may not have the starring role they once did, but it's
hard to imagine them fading into the background any time soon.

Industry:  Taking It To The Courts


Amid the hoopla over the proposed merger of Chemical Banking Corp.  and Chase
Manhattan Corp., there's an alarm sounded by several recent merger challenges
that threatens only to get louder.  Community activists are no longer willing
to simply lick their wounds when the deals get approved and their wishes go
unmet.  Now, they're suing to try to get the deals overturned.

The hotbed of this activity has been New York; it's been spearheaded by Inner
City Press/Community on the Move, a Bronx-based community group whose
executive director, Matthew Lee, has challenged a series of bank mergers in
the past few years.  Lee and his group went to court recently to fight both
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s approval of GreenPoint Bank's
acquisition of 60 Home Savings Bank branches and Chase's acquisition of mutual
fund advisory businesses from U.S.  Trust Corp.

In the former, a federal court actually issued a stay of the FDIC
approval-then concluded that no relief was warranted, largely because
GreenPoint had already made moot Inner City's chief complaint by establishing
a presence in the Bronx.  Inner City sued to block the Chase-U.S.  Trust
merger on the grounds that Chase has discriminated in its mortgage lending.
The court let the deal go forward, but agreed to review the administrative
record.

As the courts ruminate, the process for evaluating Chase-Chemical is going
through predictable paces.  The Federal Reserve Board and the New York State
Banking Department (the new Chase, as the banks call their merged entity, has
opted for a state charter) held a highly structured, two-day hearing in
mid-November at which some 150 people testified.

Anxious to cover all bases, the Fed extended the comment period by 11
days-then tacked on another three days.  The state banking department alone
received thousands of pages of testimony.  Much of what they heard and read
was utterly predictable, with executives from Chase and Chemical defending
their community service record and many activists challenging it.  A number of
legislators got into the act, with Republicans generally lauding the merger
and liberal Democrats from New York City raising objections.  In fact, a
consortium of Democrats later banded together to urge regulators to strike
down the deal.

Lee, who seems to chase Chase like Ahab pursued Moby Dick-Inner City has taken
the bank on in every merger and chartering issue in the past couple of
years-urged the regulators to deny the deal on fair lending grounds.  Chase,
he argued, "is the most exclusionary banking organization in New York."

What appears to be behind the legal truculence is activists' sense that
regulators remain loath to intervene in merger applications beyond a polite
throat-clearing and sotto voce advice to the banks to put up a bit more cash.
In a recent article in The New York Times, Ralph Nader wrote that
Chase/Chemical's pledge to boost lending in underserved areas "is
unenforceable, but it does provide cover for regulators eager to rubber-stamp
the mergers."

Nader urged a rewriting of the Bank Merger Act "by placing greater emphasis on
determining the 'public interest' in these mergers."  He added that the
Justice Department should adopt tougher standards for measuring bank
competition than those prevalent in the Reagan-Bush era.

Nader isn't likely to get his wish any time soon.  But massive mergers like
Chase-Chemical throw a spotlight on job losses and other byproducts of
consolidation that are impossible to ignore-and bring political considerations
into the equation (see Point of View, November 1995).  Add to that the new
level of legal scrutiny sought by Lee and his allies, and regulators may well
be pushed to put big mergers through a finer screening.

Lee's stated goal, an outright denial, is almost unthinkable.  Chemical has a
legacy of "outstanding" Community Reinvestment Act ratings, and the two banks
announced a five-year, $18-billion pledge for community reinvestment (though
much of it is nationwide, and targeted not at urban reinvestment but at
"affordable mortgages").

In an interview, Lee snorts that "it's the least well-defined of any of the
(bank) mega-pledges...  If they'd made a $2-billion pledge with a specific
commitment, it would have been much better."

Lee hints that if the Fed okays the merger-a decision could come as early as
late this month-his group may head back to court.  That depends in part, he
says, on how Inner City fares with its two ongoing suits.  If the only way to
get CRA enforcement is through denying an application, that's the logical
route to pursue, he adds.

"I expect the courts to slap him down, but one never knows," says Warren
Traiger, a New York attorney specializing in community reinvestment issues.
"The standard for overturning any administrative decision, of being arbitrary
and capricious, is a pretty high hurdle."

Traiger predicts that New York regulators will work "in tandem" with the Fed
on Chase/Chemical:  "I can't imagine a divergence."  The pitch and the volume
of the criticism isn't unexpected, given that the merger will create the
nation's largest bank, and the regulators can't tune it out.  Don't be
surprised if the new Chase winds up making loan commitments for a few billion
dollars more before the deal is sealed and delivered.

Mortgages:  Servicing Rights:  Still In Demand


In the third quarter of 1995, the transfer of servicing rights to loans
purchased by the nation's Congressionally chartered secondary marketing
agencies fell by 7%.

This barometer of activity in the lucrative field of mortgage servicing may be
an indication to some that the market for home servicing rights is leveling
off.  After all, in the past banks and large mortgage bankers have been
willing to pay up to seven times a loan's servicing fee for the right to
acquire servicing in the open market.  Lately, prices have fallen back to less
stratospheric levels.

Does that mean the golden days of mortgage banking are over?  Don't bet on it.

Although there has been somewhat of a lull in activity in recent months,
investment bankers and advisors that buy and sell servicing for their clients
cite a number of different reasons for the slowdown.

Some believe that buyers are waiting to see what happens with the sale of
Prudential Home Mortgage Corp., Clayton, MO, an $80-billion servicer owned by
Prudential Insurance Co.  "They want to see what type of price it commands and
who winds up with it," says one Wall Streeter.  "Once that is known, some of
the bigger players might want to rethink their strategy."

Greg Bennett, managing director for Los Angeles-based Hamilton, Carter, Smith,
believes there has actually been a supply shortage in servicing in recent
months, a situation he blames on an accounting change made by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board.  The change, referred to as FAS 122 (the number of
the rule), allows banks, mortgage bankers and other lenders to "capitalize" on
their balance sheets the servicing rights to loans they originate.
Previously, in the arcane world of accounting, only servicing rights that were
purchased on the open market could count as something of value on an
institution's balance sheet.  (The FASB rule is prospective, not retroactive.)

Bennett believes that a number of depositories that are heavily involved in
servicing "have been lulled into believing that FAS 122 has changed the
business, when in fact it has not."  Many firms are holding onto servicing
because they can count it as an asset without first having to sell it.  In
theory, this doesn't sound so bad-but capitalization does not immediately
translate into "real" cash.

"A mortgage servicer is still going to need cash," says Bennett, who has
brokered many a servicing deal in his day.  "The rule change didn't change the
economics of the business."

The HCS executive anticipates that it is only a matter of time before
companies that have been hoarding servicing begin bringing it to market once
again.  Once supply increases, prices likely will fall.

But other factors are affecting the market as well.  As U.S.  Banker went to
press in December, the bond market was continuing to rally, driving long-term
interest rates down even further.  John Wolf, a technology executive for the
mortgage division of Alltel Information Services, Jacksonville, FL, sees the
slide in rates accelerating mortgage refinancings-which, in turn, causes
servicing rights to "run off."

When this occurs, as it did during the refinancing boom of 1993, buyers of
servicing rights on new loans usually claw each other in the open market,
which increases prices.  That is good for servicing sellers, but bad for
buyers.

Currently, prices for new servicing rights on conventional, fixed-rate loans
are holding steady at about six times the servicing fee, brokers report.  (The
typical servicing fee on a Federal National Mortgage Association-purchased
loan is 25 basis points.)  But if rates fall just a bit, another price war for
newly originated product could accelerate.

In other words, the outlook for servicing rights is a bright one in 1996, and
experts anticipate that banks will continue to be big purchasers.  However, as
some banks continue to gobble up mortgage banking franchises (and the
servicing rights that go along with them), a few are exiting the business
entirely.  KeyCorp of Cleveland recently sold its servicing division, as did
Barclays American.

Bank of Boston Corp.  is spinning off BancBoston Mortgage Corp., Jacksonville,
FL, a $40-billion servicer, while First Bank System of Minneapolis is on the
verge of selling its mortgage division, FBS Mortgage Corp., St.  Paul.

Many of the current sales are being facilitated through a competitive bid
process, in which an offering circular on the target company is circulated to
prospective buyers.  However, some investment bankers feel that this year the
market could see an increase in privately negotiated transactions.  "I think
private, or 'direct' deals, represent a growing segment of the business," says
Ted Jadlos, a broker with United Financial Inc., Denver.


Based in Washington, D.C., Paul Muolo is a senior editor of National Mortgage
News, a Faulkner & Gray publication.

Embracing A Dynamic Market

JOHN A.  NIGH

Title:  President and CEO, MidAmerica Bank, St.  Paul, MN

New situation:  Comes to the Twin Cities from Wyoming, where he had been
president and CEO of Rocky Mountain Bank in Cheyenne before it was acquired in
1994 by Metropolitan Financial Corp.

Dynamic environment:  Nigh, an Indiana native, says he has had exposure over
the years to Minnesota and always admired the market.  "It's one of
strongest-growing economic areas in the country," he says.

Strategic thrust:  Plans to add new business services to MidAmerica, which has
27 branches and $650 million in assets in Minnesota and Wisconsin.  Says that
entails offering "a big basket of services," including cash management, to a
varied group of industries.  The margins in that business are attractive, and
"when you have such a diverse basket, you have a pretty diverse risk
situation."

Philosophy:  "We don't re-create the wheel.  We take a group of services, and
bundle and interlock them.  This gives the borrowers a lot better perspective,
sometimes, than they get elsewhere."  Believes that "the CEO is the number one
marketing person in the bank.  This is a sales business.  The whole game is
the manner of delivery."

Competition:  Acknowledges the prowess of superregional competitors like
Norwest Corp.  and First Bank System.  "We're not going to take that group
on," he says.  Believes there is a very viable place for a small bank that is
"both very high-touch and very high-tech."

Background:  Started in banking 23 years ago in Omaha, and ran two small
institutions in the 1970s.  Went to Wyoming in 1983, where he worked for Key
Bancshares (predecessor of KeyCorp) and rose to executive vice president.
Moved to Rocky Mountain Bank after it was formed in 1988 from the combination
of two failed thrifts.

Still in the Snow Belt:  Acknowledges that he can't expect warmer winters in
Minnesota, but says, "I think the wind is worse in Wyoming."


Plotting A Global Course

JOSEPH BARTOLONI

Title:  Managing Director, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce's Wood Gundy
Securities Inc.'s Global Technology Unit

Responsibilities:  Supervises systems development and product support for the
investment bank of the Toronto-based commercial banking company.

The vision thing:  Working closely with his boss, Tom Kielty, Wood Gundy's
senior vice president for technology, on a new information technology strategy
to support the firm's global capital markets and other securities operations.

Small is beautiful:  "The whole client/server environment is the core of our
direction," he says.  During the past 15 years, Bartoloni has observed smaller
platforms like workstations and personal computer local-area networks assume
the dominant role in investment banking.  "I don't even know if we have any
mainframes in our current environment."  In the past, workstations and PCs
were often just stopgap solutions for setting up new offices in London or
Tokyo.  Now, the small systems perform almost all of the firm's computing
tasks.

Need for speed:  In a world where dollars fly past yen at the speed of light,
and the European countries are in the midst of creating a common currency from
scratch, someone in Bartoloni's job has to work fast.  "The markets are the
dominating factor," and there's never a lot of time to work on new projects.

Background:  Ran a management consulting business for commercial and
investment banks for the past two years.  Spent the previous 13 years in
investment banking, including successive six-year stints at Merrill Lynch from
1980-86 and First Boston from 1986-92.  Also spent two years at Lehman
Brothers.

Education:  B.S.  and MBA from New York University, where he also studied
computer science.

Spare time:  Spends his free time with his wife, son and daughter, and he also
coaches the kids' soccer and basketball teams.

A PROSPEROUS NEW YEAR?

While accountants in the US were celebrating the victory in narrowing
liability, some practitioners in the UK were starting to count hard the
cost of unlimited, as well as joint and several, liability.

The final shape of the US tort reform, which became law just before the
Christmas break, looks a sensible measure which should protect
accountants from the excesses of frivolous actions, but leaves them
exposed enough to want to maintain the highest professional standards
(see page 2 for full report).

Unfortunately, the issues are not so clear-cut in the UK where the
conjunction of several events has tangled the debate. Firstly, there is
the Binders/ADT legal case. The action related to an agreed bid by
Britannia Security Group, audited by Binders. After the acquisition ADT
found the profits and net assets over stated. The judge found that not
only had Binders been negligent but they owed a duty of care to ADT
because the lead partner told ADT in an 'off the cuff' remark that he
stood by the firm's audit opinion. Out goes Caparo where it was decided
an auditor did not have a duty of care to third parties - unless the
Appeal Court says something different.

There is only bad news and worse news

On to the damages: the bad news was that the judge awarded damages
totalling #105m ($160m): the worse news is that the firm only has
insurance cover of #71m leaving partners to pick up the tag for the
rest - an uncomfortable #300,000 each for the 100 or so partners
involved. Binders partners are left to sweat for a year or so and the
rest of the profession can declare that something must be done to solve
the problem they have, in part, created. The obvious solution would be
reform the law, but that looks unlikely to happen quickly, with a
government gearing up for an election, despite an official review of
the problem which is due to be published soon.

So the Big 6 firms lost patience and decided to take matters into their
own hands.

Incorporation seems the best way forward

Before the ADT decision, KPMG partners had already announced that they
were going to incorporate as the best solution they could find to the
liability crisis. And alongside incorporation they have promised full
financial disclosure. Whether the revelation over size of partners'
drawing helps or hinders the firms' cause remains to be seen.

At the same time as the ADT bombshell, Ernst & Young and Price
Waterhouse announced they intend to avoid possible financial disaster
by forming limited liability partnerships in the offshore haven of
Jersey. All they need is the legislation due this summer from the
Jersey Parliament which would be similar to Delaware law in the US and,
in theory at least, would protect partners' private assets.

Whether any of these moves will, in the long run, help firms
professionally, commercially or on the PR front, remains to be seen.
There are many examples of trends starting in the US and quickly
reaching the UK and elsewhere. In the case of tort reform, for UK
partners at least, this particular trend cannot cross the pond too
soon.

ACCOUNTANTS GET LITIGATION RELIEF FOR CHRISTMAS

Just days before Christmas, the US accounting profession's long held
wish for securities litigation reform was finally granted. It was the
best Christmas present imaginable for a profession that has been
battered by enormous legal expenses.

For the past four years, the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants (AICPA) and the major accounting firms had intensely
lobbied Congress for litigation reform. 'We are extremely pleased with
the legislation enacted,' Margaret Simmons, legislative affairs
coordinator for AICPA, told WAR.

In recent years, the Big 6 firms have collectively spent as much as 12%
of their annual fee income defending or settling litigation. The new
legislation should significantly lighten that burden.

Two key provisions of the new legislation, formally known as the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, are expected to curb
the number of lawsuits brought against accountants. The first has to do
with what is known as the pleading stage of a case. The new law
requires that plaintiffs in a securities lawsuit make specific
allegations of management fraud at the time the suit is filed, said
Simmons.

This was not a requirement in the past. Plaintiff attorneys had been
accused of turning the discovery stage into fishing expeditions
designed to rack up huge legal bills. The mounting legal costs
encouraged many defendants to cut their losses by settling out of
court, even though they might have been innocent of any wrongdoing.
Legal scholars say that the new pleading standard raises the threshold
for a case to proceed to discovery, which should significantly reduce
accounting firms' legal expenses.

A second important provision of the reform bill does away with the
joint and several liability system that had been in place. Under the
new law, defendants can only be held responsible for the proportion of
the losses they are deemed to have caused. In the past, if a company
went insolvent and its auditors were deemed to have contributed to even
a small percentage of investor losses, the accounting firm could be
held fully liable for all investor losses.

Under the new law, joint and several liability remains in place only in
instances where the accounting firm is shown to have participated in
the fraud.

AICPA president Barry Melancon said the law now strikes a fair balance
between the rights of truly defrauded investors and outside
professionals 'who had become victims of a small group of
entrepreneurial lawyers abusing the legal system.'

Other important protections afforded by the new law include:

- A 'safe harbour' provision protects companies, and their advisers,
from claims of fraud in the event that their prediction of future
performance do not pan out.

- A provision requires courts to sanction plaintiffs and plaintiff
attorneys who initiate frivolous lawsuits.

- The statute of limitations for filing securities lawsuits remains
unchanged. Plaintiffs must file claims within three years of the time
the violation occurred or within one year of the time the violation is
discovered.

- A provision allows judges to select as lead plaintiff in a class-
action lawsuit the party with the greatest financial stake. Some
plaintiffs had been accused of taking small stakes in numerous
companies, thereby positioning themselves to become lead plaintiffs to
the largest number of potential class actions.

The accounting community's original reform wish-list included several
other provisions which became casualties of the legislative process and
did not become law. These included a fee shifting proposal that would
have required unsuccessful plaintiffs to pay all legal fees incurred by
the defendants.

All in all, the new law provides accountants all the protections they
could have reasonably hoped for, Simmons said.

As a tradeoff for the protections afforded by the act, accountants will
be subjected to additional oversight on the part of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC). The new law gives the SEC the power to
prosecute accountants, lawyers and underwriters who wittingly help
corporate executives commit fraud.

The SEC had previously had that power stripped from it in a 1994
Supreme Court case. The court held that corporate advisers could not be
held liable for the actions of their clients.

Another significant concession made by the accounting profession is a
provision of the law which make accountants responsible to report
fraud. An auditor who uncovers fraud during an audit must report the
illegality to the company's audit committee, its board of directors or,
in some circumstances, the SEC.

The new legislation is notable not only for the protections it affords
accountants, but also for the dramatic manner in which it became law.

In early December, both houses of Congress voted on and passed the
final version of the litigation reform bill by wide margins. It was
presented to President Clinton, who had earlier expressed his support,
to be signed into law.

At the eleventh hour, the president unexpectedly vetoed the
legislation. The veto reportedly came after the president held a
private meeting with William Lerach, a prominent member of the
plaintiff bar and one of the largest contributors to the Democratic
party which funded Clinton's presidential bid.

In response, the AICPA fired off a terse press release decrying the
veto. It read in part: 'The President has once again neglected the will
of the people and caved in to a small group of wealthy, powerful
contributors.'

Despite the veto, the coalition supporting the bill held together. On
20 December and 22 December respectively, the House of Representatives
and the Senate voted to override the presidential veto (a two-thirds
super majority was required in each chamber) and passed the bill into
law.

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 was the first veto
override suffered by the Clinton administration.

REPORT PUBLISHED ON PROVISIONS

FASB has published a report, Provisions: Their recognition, measurement
and disclosure in financial statements, in conjunction with standard-
setters in the UK, Canada and Australia as well as the International
Accounting Standards Committee. The report is aimed at developing
solutions to accounting problems based on common accounting frameworks.

FASB chairman Dennis Beresford noted that: 'Accounting for provisions
is an important topic for standard-setters around the world because
they are often material in reporting financial performance. Very little
accounting guidance currently exists for provisions, which may lead to
a diversity in practice.'

The report explores the basic issues of when provisions should be
recognised, how they should be measured, and what disclosures should be
made. Additionally, the report considers specific applications to
future operating losses and restructuring costs, areas in which
provisions are often recognised.

WORKSHOP DEFINES OBJECTIVES

An UNCTAD workshop on environmental accounting recently established
priorities for its current work programme. Participants decided to
prepare a synthesis of existing financial accounting requirements, look
at links between financial reporting and general environmental
monitoring information, and work on systems which produce environmental
cost accounting information for companies.

Following on from the 1995 conference of the Intergovernmental Working
Group of Experts in International Standards of Accounting and Reporting
(ISAR) which presented a series of studies on environmental accounting
(see WAR, April 1995, p2), participants from several countries met in
Geneva recently to discuss what further contribution UNCTAD could make
in this area. The ISAR conference had suggested that some form of
guidelines could be produced.

The working party defined environmental accounting as taking in
financial accounting (eg provisions for decommissioning costs), 'full
cost' management accounting, general environmental reporting, and
environmental audit. It decided that work could be done to present and
integrate existing financial accounting rules which bear on
environmental issues as a first step. Similarly, a study could be made
of environmental reporting indicators in use to see which were the most
meaningful, and examine whether any useful link could be built between
financial reporting and the present free-ranging, voluntary
environmental reporting which is being done by some companies.

Some companies are experimenting with cost accounting which provides a
picture of environmental costs. Participants observed that much of this
work was not published because of its confidential nature, but this
prevented rapid development. UNCTAD had a role there, but it was felt
that it should not involve itself further in environmental auditing.

It was also decided that UNCTAD should look at the possibility of
providing an electronic bulletin board for environmental accounting
literature, as well as developing education and training programmes in
due course.

TRADE IN PROFESSIONAL SERVICES

The World Trade Organisation (WTO) working party on professional
services, which is working on cross-border provision of accounting
services, had its third meeting in January. The meeting set out a list
of subjects to be addressed in a model agreement, and asked for further
information on professional qualifications in developing countries.

The WTO's council for trade in services was established as part of the
last GATT agreement to prepare the way for a liberalisation of cross-
border trade in services, with accounting as a priority. It has
established a working party which met for the first time last October
(see WAR November 1995, p3) whose objective is to prepare a model
agreement for cross-border trade in accounting services.

At its January meeting in Geneva, the working party, to which all WTO
members are entitled to send representatives, agreed on a list of
issues which would need to be addressed in any model agreement. This
list includes questions such as:

- mutual recognition of professional qualifications
- minimum periods of post-qualification experience
- minimum educational requirements
- professional liability arrangements
- relationships with local professional bodies
- use of IASC standards.

Members of the working party agreed to review these issues from a
national perspective and meet again in March to discuss them.

Although the working party had already been given extensive briefings
by IFAC and UNCTAD in October, some members felt that they need further
information about conditions in developing countries before they could
proceed. The collection of such data would take some time, and would
have the effect of considerably slowing progress, which could, of
course, be one reason for suggesting it.

WHO HOLDS THE GOVERNANCE REINS?

A taskforce of the International Capital Markets Group (ICMG) has
released a report entitled Who holds the reins?, focusing on the
international dimension of corporate governance, from a review of
corporate governance practices and issues in countries such as the US,
UK and Canada.

The taskforce encourages all major companies to disclose the key areas
of their corporate governance processes so that they have appropriate
checks in place to direct and manage businesses, and so that investors
understand that differences exist between countries. The taskforce
however ruled out the idea of prescribing an international standard for
corporate governance because, as ICMG members stated: 'Governance is
about behaviour. It is deeply rooted in national cultures which vary
widely, reflecting the economic, social and legal traditions of each
country.'

ICMG is encouraging debate on its recommendations among its constituent
members - the Federation Internationale des Bourses de Valeurs, the
International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) and the Section on
Business Law of the International Bar Association.

Copies of Who holds the reins? are available from IFAC, 114 West 47th
Street, Suite 2410, New York, NY 10036.

IASC LOOKS AGAIN AT SEGMENTAL REPORTING

The International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC), has published
an Exposure Draft, E51 on segmental reporting which proposes major
changes to its existing standard, published 15 years ago.

E51 proposes to change the way in which segments are identified and add
several new segment disclosure requirements. It would also make an
enterprise's internal organisation and management structure and its
system of internal financial reporting to the chief executive officer
the basis for identifying the dominant source and nature of risks and
therefore the business or geographical segments reported.

A safety net provision will ensure that if there is evidence that
internally reported segments combine parts of the business with
different risks and returns, they must be disaggregated for external
reporting purposes.

The E51 proposals are the result of cooperation between IASC and North
American standard-setters, as well as extensive consultations with
financial analysts and multinational corporations.

EUROPE: FEE STATES GROWTH IN ENVIRONMENTAL AUDITING

FEE has published a survey called Environmental accounting, reporting
and auditing: Survey of current activities and developments within the
accountancy profession covering all 15 European Union countries, as
well as Iceland, Israel, Norway and Switzerland.

It concludes that there is clear and definite growth in the importance
attached to environmental accounting, reporting and auditing in
business across the EU, but environmental information is still largely
restricted to qualitative information with no assessment of the
financial impact.

The survey is based on the responses to a questionnaire circulated
among FEE's 34 member organisations in 22 countries.

FEE said that: 'The development of an accounting and management
reporting framework which specifically addresses environmental issues
is perhaps some way off. In the meantime, firms should be encouraged to
disclose more detailed environmental information in their financial
statements with an indication of the financial impact, while auditors
should cooperate more closely with experts and advisers from other
disciplines in the environmental field.

ECO-AUDIT STANDARDS ARE 'ACCEPTABLE'

EU Environment Ministers meeting in Brussels on 18 December raised no
objections to the British, Irish and Spanish standards for eco-audits.
The standards need formal recognition under the EU's environmental
management and audit system regulation, which came into being last
April. The British standard BS7750, the Irish Standard IS310, First
Edition and the Spanish standard UNE77-801(2)-94 were referred to the
Council of Ministers owing to disagreement in the EMAS regulatory
committee.

EU GREEN ACCOUNTING GUIDELINES PUBLISHED

Businesses in the EU can now include environmental expenditure in their
annual accounts. Guidelines have been drawn up by the Accounting
Advisory Forum as an advisory document for the EC, and focus on
applying the provisions in the EU's 4th and 7th Company Law Directives
on annual and consolidated accounts to environmental considerations.
Although not legally binding, they are the only green accounting
guidelines to be formulated at EU level so far. The EC is urging
companies to use them in response to a growing insistence by
shareholders and investors that companies shoulder their environmental
protection responsibilities, although it said that the report does not
reflect its official position.

The objective of the guidelines, entitled Environmental issues in
financial reporting is to ensure that company accounts paint an
accurate picture of:

- a company's attitude towards the environment, and

- the impact of environmental risks and liabilities on a company's
financial position.

The document provides recommendations on the definition and disclosure
of environmental expenditure and the recognition, measurement and
disclosure of environmental risks and liabilities.

AUSTRALIA: SOCIETY CALLS FOR E50'S WITHDRAWAL

The Australian Society CPAs is calling for the immediate withdrawal of
E50, the ISAC's proposed International Accounting Standard on
intangibles. In an unprecedented public attack on IASC actions, ASCPA
president Jim Kropp said the proposed standard 'out of touch with the
modern economy' and will 'discriminate against companies which have
assets of this kind'.

'There is a need to reassess how to measure, recognise and disclose
identifiable intangible assets - and this should not be done by
redefinition of terms nor by taking the issue outside the context of
existing standard.'

The Society has sent the IASC a submission based on a recent Society
report Accounting for identifiable intangible assets including
goodwill. The report argues that intangibles should not be treated any
differently from other assets.

Jim Kropp, a partner in Price Waterhouse, Sydney, maintains there is
increasing diversity among international standards addressing the
recognition and measurement of assets.

'In this draft, for example, there are many exemptions, as well as
inconsistencies with other international standards such as IAS 16
'Property plant and equipment' and IAS 22 'Business combinations' which
would penalise enterprises developing or holding intellectual assets.

'What we most strenuously object to is the impact on those enterprises
with intangible assets.' In most cases, these companies will be forced
to amortise the asset within 20 years - a period which is often much
less than the useful life of the asset - and a period which will force
companies with extremely valuable intangibles to suffer a paper loss in
real company value. 'Such a harsh approach is unwarranted and out of
touch with modern economic reality.'

Kropp said that some assets have an indeterminate useful life and would
be best measured by subjecting them to a recoverable test rather than
the amortisation regime advocated in E50. The Society also criticised
the restrictive approach taken to initial recognition of an intangible
asset being based solely on cost. The use of an 'other value' approach,
provided it can be reliably measured, is appropriate, particularly in
relation to intangibles, the submission states.

The ASCPA wants E50 to be withdrawn and reconsidered by the IAS
Steering Committee.

'In its current form, the Society would not recommend to the Australian
Accounting Standards Boards and the Public Sector Accounting Standards
Board to pursue Australian harmonisation with this draft standard,'
Kropps said. 'This is a good example of why Australian standard-setters
should maintain strong influence over the direction of international
standards.'

GOODWILL ED ISSUED

'The Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB), and the Public
Sector Accounting Standards Board (PSASB), have approved the issue of
an Exposure Draft which proposes changing the accounting standard on
goodwill to require entities to amortise goodwill on a straight-line
basis.

They say the effect of the amendments would 'make the Australian
standard and existing practice more comparable with standards and
practices in most other countries.'

The main effect of the proposal will be to preclude the use, by a small
number of entities, of the 'Inverse Sum Of the Years Digits' (ISOYD)
and similar methods.

The ISOYD method results in small amortisation charges in early years
and the defers the bulk of amortisation charges to later years. In
September 1995, the Urgent Issues Group placed a moratorium on the use
of ISOYD method until 1 July 1996, and requested the Boards to clarify
the standard.

The Exposure Draft proposes that the standard will apply to reporting
periods ending on or after 30 June 1996. AASB chairman, Ken Spencer,
notes that the scope of the current review of the standard is limited
to dealing with the issue referred to Boards by the UIG. Consideration
of this issue could not be delayed and considered as part of a more
comprehensive review of the standards. International developments, such
as the new approach to accounting for goodwill being debated in the UK,
are not likely to become clear before the UIG moratorium ends. The
Exposure Draft is open for public comment until 15 February 1996.

ED RELEASED ON NON-CURRENT ASSETS

AASB and PSASB have released Exposure Draft on accounting for non-
current assets. ED 70, proposes amendments to the depreciation and
revaluation standards to remove impediments for entities adopting
current values for non-current assets. The proposed amendments to the
revaluation standard would permit entities to revalue non-current
assets on a progressive basis, as long as all assets within the
relevant class are revalued consistently within a three year period.

The standard, which currently require revaluations of all assets within
a class to be completed as at the same date, is considered to impose an
onerous requirement on public sector entities which have adopted a
policy of revaluing non-current assets frequently and on an on-going
basis.

ED 70 permits entities, adopting a current cost or deprival value
bases, an option in the disclosure of asset value. ED 70 also proposes
that the definition of 'useful life' in the depreciation standards be
changed to reflect the period over which an entity expects to use an
assets rather than the period over which the asset could remain useful
in some other environment.

The Boards say this amendment will ensure that depreciation expenses
are more closely related to the pattern of economic benefits consumed
by the entity and that the amended standards will be more comparable
with pronouncements overseas.

The comment period for ED 70 is short. It closes on 29 February 1996.
The short period reflects the need for public sector entities to adopt
these amendments in preparing their financial reports for 30 June 1996.

EQUITY METHODS PROPOSED

AASB and PSAB have also approved the issue of ED 71, Accounting for
investments in associates by the equity method. The ED proposes that
entities equity account investments in associates in their financial
statements. The Boards note there is a perceived impediment in the
Corporations Law to applying equity accounting on the face of the
financial statements, and companies are disclosing information about
their associates in the notes to the financial statements.

The Second Corporate Law Simplification Bill 1995 proposes to remove
the perceived legal impediment to equity accounting.

Now the Boards have responded by developing an Exposure Draft which, if
adopted, would bring Australian practices in this area into line with
practice overseas.

The ED proposes that equity accounting be applied in the consolidated
financial statements for all investments in associates and, except in
limited circumstances, the cost method of accounting is to be applied
in the investor's separate financial statements.

Other features of the draft proposals:

- the equity method of accounting is to be applied in respect of all
associates. Associates are defined broadly to include associated
companies, partnerships, trusts and other forms of arrangement in which
the investor has an ownership interest and has the capacity to exercise
significant influence;

- the carrying amount of an equity accounted investment must not exceed
its net market value;

The ED proposes that the subsequent standard will apply for reporting
periods ending on or after 30 June 1997. Closing date for public
comment on the proposals is 31 March 1996.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO BE DERECOGNISED

The Urgent Issues Group (UIG) is continuing to examine the issue of
whether internally generated identifiable intangible assets can be
'derecognised'.

The group notes that the accounting standards AASB 1010 and AAS 10,
Accounting for the revaluation of non-current assets identify the
circumstances in which assets can be revalued downwards, and Statement
of Accounting Concepts ASC 4, Definition and recognition of the
elements of financial statements, identifies the circumstances in which
assets could be derecognised.

At its most recent meeting the UIG concluded that the issue under
consideration was much broader than that the derecognition of only
internally generated intangible assets. The group agreed that it should
clarify that a 'revaluation' included a change in accounting policies
related to the bases of measurement adopted for any class of assets.

A once only change in the basis should be allowed, and that a change
back to a cost basis should be permitted only within the transitional
period.

After this transitional period expires AASB 1010 and AAS 10 will only
allow a downwards revaluation arising from a change in the basis of
measurement when the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its
recoverable amount.

In these circumstances AASB 1010 and AAS 10 will require that the asset
not be revalued below its recoverable amount.

LACK OF CONSENSUS ON DEPRECIATION POLICY

The UIG has been unable to reach a consensus on the treatment of
changes in the rate of depreciation which arise from revised estimates
of useful life or residual value.

The alternatives canvassed by the UIG include depreciating the asset at
the new rate over its remaining life, or adjusting the carrying amount
of the asset by making a catch-up adjustment in the profit and loss or
other operating statement.

The relevant accounting standards AASB 1021 and AAS 4, Depreciation of
non-current assets do not specify how to deal with revisions of
estimates and the requirements of international standards vary as does
practice in Australia.

Discussion at the UIG indicated that most Australian companies adopted
a prospective approach and this was the practice in many overseas
countries.

To reach a consensus, 11 of the 16 UIG members must vote for, and no
more than two vote against, the proposed ruling.

A majority of members favoured the prospective approach but there were
more than two members who did not think it correct. The group does not
plan to discuss the issue any further.

- Peter Day has been appointed chairman of the UIG in place of Peter
Edwards who died last year. Day is currently managing director of Group
Business Services at CRA Ltd. He is a former chairman of the Australian
Accounting Standards Board and a former president of the Group of 100.

BULGARIA: ACCOUNTING FOR BANKS STANDARD APPROVED

A new National Accounting Standard (NAS) 16 has been approved by the
government in Bulgaria to replace the existing NAS 16. It deals with
accounting for banks and non-banking financial institutions.

The new standard focuses mainly on financial statements, but it also
deals with branches of foreign banks and non-banking organisations,
performing banking transactions in Bulgaria with a permit (licence)
issued by the Bulgarian National Bank.

In this standard the Bulgarian National Bank is defined as the
authorised organisation to determine rules of accounting for bank
operations. The most significant difference between the old standard
and the new one is that the detailed regulation of the principles of
accounting for bank operations - which were described at length in the
old standard - is absent in the latter. The other difference is that
the primary accounting documents and ledgers, such as journal of the
operations, trial balance, general ledger, operation ledger etc, were
described in detail in the old standard. The structure of the National
Bank Chart of Accounts, in effect since 1 June 1995, was elaborated in
the old Chart of Accounts, while the new standard only briefly mentions
the existence of such a Chart of Accounts.

Opinions differ. Some experts think that the new Chart of Accounts is
much more concise and clearer. Others - mainly bank experts - say that
it is much more incomplete and insufficient.

NAS 16 has the following structure:

- General provisions - describing the regulations and institutions they
are applicable for.

- Definitions - giving definitions to the term financial institution,
bank transaction, bank operation, individual item, accounting date,
values.

- Characteristics of the accounting policy.
- Specific rules of accounting for bank operations.
- Periodic financial statements. Financial statements.

FRANCE: PEER REVIEW RESULTS PUBLISHED

The auditors' association, the Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux
Comptes (CNCC), and the stock market regulator, the Commission des
Operations de Bourse (COB), have published their annual report for 1994
on the review of audit files of listed companies and investment funds.
The report notes that 94% of the cases were satisfactory, but they
noted problems concerning the treatment of intangibles in group
accounts, the methods for determining provisions, and the completeness
of the financial information provided by companies.

COB and CNCC operate joint committees which review the audit files of
listed companies. This year the committees looked at 90 companies on
the main market and 37 on the second market as well as 39 investment
funds.

The review committees noted that the evaluation of internal controls
had improved and overall the number of problems noted had fallen,
suggesting an improvement in audit quality. However, they said that the
most common problems concerned the calculation of goodwill in
consolidated accounts and other intangibles and their depreciation.
They also thought that the choices made by companies in excluding or
including companies within the consolidation were not well-documented
or explained. They criticised the methods used by some companies in
calculating provisions.

CNCC has a programme of peer review for all audit engagements, although
COB participates only in the examination of the files of listed
companies. In the year under review, in addition to the work on listed
companies, CNCC looked at 4,400 audit files throughout France,
involving the work of 2,200 auditors.

FRANCE: FREE SERVICES FOR NEW COMPANIES

The Ordre des Experts Comptables has undertaken a series of initiatives
designed to encourage newly-formed businesses to use the services of
accounting firms. These will involve free start-up advice and budget
preparation, as well as reduced fees for work during the first three
years of a company's life.

An agreement signed by Rene Richol, president Ordre, and the Minister
of Finance in 1994 provided for free services for individual
entrepreneurs in the first year of their activity, including budgets
and ultimately preparations of the first tax return. To this has now
been added two further agreements, with the Centres de gestion agrees
(management centres) and the chambers of commerce.

Historically the members of the Ordre have regarded the management
centres, a government initiative to provide free advice to small
businesses, as competitors, but they have now agreed to provide
management training for management centre clients, and develop
diagnostic models which would help new small businesses to develop.

The Ordre is offering up to three years of work at reduced fees for
businesses which are members of an Association for the Development of
Young Businesses. In addition it has agreed with the national
organisation of chambers of commerce to provide budgets for business
seeking finance. The chambers of commerce will help validate forecasts.

ISRAEL: COMMISSION REJECTS AUDIT STANDARD

In a surprise move, the Securities Commission has stated that it will
not accept accounts with new style audit report. In December 1995 the
Institute published a new version of the audit reports as part of its
plan to adopt many of the IFAC and IASC standards as soon as possible.

The extended report refers specifically to the extent of the auditors'
work. The standard which was to apply to all accounts ending or after
31 December 1995 was firmly rejected by the Commission which claimed
that the new report is an attempt to reduce the auditors'
responsibilities and liabilities.

The Institute has stated that its only intention remains to explain
clearly the extent of the work of the auditor and reduce the
expectation gap of shareholders and the public. The Institute has
always contended that it has the sole right to set standards and
therefore the Auditors' Council (an office of the Ministry of Justice)
stepping in to settle the dispute has taken the profession by surprise.
The Ministry of Justice is now preparing a legal opinion as to the
authority of the Institute to set standards. Meanwhile the Institute
has agreed that the new standard will only be used on auditors' reports
signed after mid February. Members of the Institute's central committee
and members in general fear that it is yet another example of the
Securities Commission trying to 'muscle in' on the standards making
process. After years of disputes concerning accounting standards, in
the end a joint committee with the Institute, Securities Commission,
Industrialists and the tax authorities was formed. It was assumed that
the audit standards would remain the sole prerogative of the Institute.

ISRAEL: QUALITY CONTROL RULE FACES REBELLION

Israel Pinini, treasurer of the Institute, has mounted a final effort
to prevent the adoption of the new standard for quality control in
accountant's office. He hopes that within a few days he will have
sufficient members (300) to call a special general meeting to block the
new standard, due to be adopted this month. Small practices contend
that the administration and requirements for specialised departments
will create a two tier practice or drive them out of the profession.
The Institute sees the standard as a prelude to adopting ISO 9000.

ISRAEL: LAW INCREASES AUDITORS' LIABILITIES

The new company law currently passing through the Knesset (parliament)
has further increased the profession's anxieties about professional
negligence claims. The new law proposes the auditors must report on all
the actions of directors. The proposal is that they must examine and
comment on not only financial matters but also all aspects of
management and administration and the affect on the company,
shareholders, other interested parties, and the general public.
Meanwhile the director is personally indemnified against his actions.

In addition it is proposed that auditors fees will be set in general
meeting of the members only. This right cannot be delegated to the
directors, even on a temporary basis.

ISRAEL: ROTATION OF AUDITORS IS A MYTH

Government companies are required to change auditors every three years.
In practice the management of the companies postpone the change
whenever possible. The latest example is the Electricity Corporation,
one of the largest and most profitable companies in Israel. Despite the
requirement to appoint a new auditor, the management have successfully
postponed the change indefinitely. As a result, Somekh Chaikan (Price
Waterhouse) remain the auditors and Kost Levary & Forer (Ernst & Young)
lose out.

ITALY: COOPERS' AUDIT APPOINTMENT REVOKED

Coopers & Lybrand have suffered a serious blow as a result of the
Gemina affair. In September a major merger operation - SuperGemina-
Ferfin - was announced followed soon after by revelations of heavy
losses within the Gemina group.

In a newsletter published last month (January), Commissione Nazionale
per le Societa e la Borsa (Consob - the companies and stock market
regulator which also supervises the roll of approved audit firms),
announced that it has instructed Coopers not to use the services of its
partner Renato Bellani for a period of two years. Moreover, the
accountants have had their three-year 1995-1997 appointment as Gemina's
auditors revoked.

In announcing its decision, Consob said: 'The penalty has been adopted
on the basis of the checks carried out on the audit work for the 1992
and 1993 financial statements of Gemina Ratealfactor, of the Gemina
group consolidated accounts for 1993 and consolidated accounts of RCS
Editori at 31 December 1992 and 31 December 1993.'

Following Consob's decision, Coopers said that it seems that Consob has
chosen the Gemina affair to set a pilot decision. 'For the first time,
in fact, a form of objective responsibility has been adopted with
regard to the principal auditors of a group, putting the blame onto
them for the work done by others.'

Making their complaint against the regulator, Coopers said that the
losses which were the subject of Consob's investigations in the Gemina
case, arose in the hire purchase sales sector of RCS Libri & Grandi
Opere and that these losses were not brought into evidence quickly
because of serious shortcomings in the internal controls of the
company. But RCS Libri & Grandi Opere was audited by another firm,
while Coopers audited its parent, RCS Editori, and the group parent
Gemina. Coopers, in accordance with current practice, relied on the
work done by the other, well-qualified, audit firm, which had audited
RCS Libri & Grandi Opere for many years.

Coopers claim that their work was wholly correct and say that the
losses investigated by Consob, in so far as they were reflected in
Gemina's consolidated accounts, arose from sources that were not within
Coopers' competence. 'Consob's decision is therefore unjust and Coopers
will appeal to the regional administrative tribunal to have it
annulled,' said the firm.

ITALY: PROFESSION DISPUTE RAGES ON

The long-running dispute between Italy's dottori commercialisti
(commercial practitioner accountants) and ragionieri (bookkeeper
accountants) on professional titles is continuing. In mid-December the
dottori commercialisti's national council wrote to Prime Minister
Lamberto Dini, in his temporary capacity as Justice Minister, to
express its concern and seek remedial action. The dottori
commercialisti are expected to mount a publicity campaign in which the
problem of professional safeguards for the public will be highlighted.
As university graduates, they object to the use of the title
commercialisti by ragionieri. On the other hand, the ragionieri, who
also wrote to Dini in mid-December, would like to see a single role of
accountants, with the two titles unified. They say that the dottori
commercialisti have brought too many onto their roll, creating an
employment problem that they are trying to solve by taking market share
from the ragionieri.

NEW ZEALAND: AGREEMENT REACHED ON JOINT ED

As part of the commitment by New Zealand and Australia to harmonise
accounting standards, the two accounting standard-setting bodies have
agreed to issue a joint exposure draft (ED) on financial reporting by
Life Insurance companies.

April Mackenzie, director of Accounting and Professional Standards for
the New Zealand Accountants Society, said the main issue is taking the
ED jointly through the final stages. She compared the problems posed by
different regulatory requirements in each country, with those faced by
EU members when tackling harmonisation on other issues.

Mackenzie said that in developing financial reporting standards
particular notice is paid to the position of the International
Accounting Standards Committee (IASC). She believes the achievements of
the IASC will influence New Zealand accounting practices even more over
time.

IASC was represented at a meeting of delegates from standard-setting
bodies in Australia, UK and South Africa, hosted by the New Zealand
Society last year.

NEW ZEALAND: NEW CHEQUE LAW AFFECTS ACCOUNTANTS

New Zealand accountants can no longer deposit crossed non-negotiable
cheques, which are made out in the name of client, in their trust
accounts. Under new banking laws, crossed cheques now cannot be
endorsed for payment to another person and can only be paid into the
account of the named payee. This means accountants who receive payments
on behalf of clients have to make special arrangements to ensure they
can continue to bank the payments in their trust accounts. Preferably
they must ensure the cheque is made out to the accountancy firm instead
of in the client's name. Alternatively they must arrange for open
cheques.

A request to the New Zealand parliament seeking exemption for trust
account operators to continue depositing cheques made out to clients,
into their trust accounts was refused. The law-makers decided that to
give accountants and lawyers this exemption from the new law, would
weaken the protection now provided by the new non-transferable
regulations.

While admitting accountants will suffer some inconvenience, parliament
decided it was more important for the writer of a cheque to ensure it
was paid only to the payee.

In the past there was a widely held belief that crossing a cheque
prevented it from being endorsed and transferred to a person other than
the payee named. In fact under banking law which existed up to 1
January 1996, it did not.

The new law, aimed at preventing fraud says that now a crossed cheque
bearing the words 'Not transferable', 'Non transferable' or 'Account
payee' can only be paid to the named payee. Thieves will no longer be
able to cash stolen cheques by forging an endorsement to themselves or
to a third party.

Another provision of the new banking law is that banks no longer have
to physically transfer paper cheques to the branches on which they are
drawn. Now the details can be done electronically - cutting costs and
speeding up cheque clearance.

NEW ZEALAND: SHARING THE COST OF STANDARDS

The president of the New Zealand Accountants Society, Colin Notley,
agrees with those who argue that the cost of researching and developing
standards should be shared by the business community and others who
benefit from their application.

This argument, said Notley, has been given added strength because New
Zealand's Financial Reporting Standards, when approved by the
Accounting Standards Review Board, now carry legal backing.

'In one sense the Society's Financial Reporting Standards Board - which
does the preliminary work reviewing standards - has become a research
and working arm of government,' added Notley.

UNITED KINGDOM: 'EFFECTIVENESS' SHOULD GO SAYS APB

Interpretation of the word 'effectiveness' when asking directors to
report on internal financial control effectiveness is a sticking point,
according to the Auditing Practices Board (APB). The APB has released
the text of a letter it has sent to Sir Ronald Hampel, chairman of the
newly formed 'Committee on Corporate Governance', setting out its
principal conclusions following consultation concerning reporting by
auditors on the matter.

To build on progress made to date, the APB considers that the Hampel
Committee should:

- Consider further how best to report on internal financial control. In
particular there is the need either to define much more closely the
meaning of the term 'effectiveness' or consider whether there are other
options that would meet the spirit of the original Cadbury proposal but
avoid the need to interpret the term effectiveness. Announcing the APB
conclusions, APB chairman Ian Plaistowe said: 'We believe that auditors
will find it difficult to report on internal financial control
effectiveness unless words are changed. The APB would support words
along the lines of statements used by the BOC Group plc and The Coca-
Cola Company.' The report of the BOC Group directors states: 'The
directors believe that the Group's system of internal financial control
provides reasonable but not absolute assurance that assets are
safeguarded, transactions are authorised and recorded properly and that
material errors and irregularities are either prevented or would be
detected within a timely period.'

- Study further the role of internal auditors in reporting on internal
control. The Cadbury Report did not deal, other than in passing
reference, with the role of internal audit. Internal auditors have an
integral part to play in any regime in which directors and auditors
report on internal controls. In particular, they are likely to consider
the wider concept of non-financial internal controls, whereas the work
of external auditors is focused more on internal financial controls.

The APB letter is a culmination of feedback and consultation which
began in December 1994 when the APB published Guidance for directors.
Implementation of the guidance has resulted in many listed companies
carrying out detailed reviews of their internal financial controls and
commentators believe that, as a result, controls are improving. The APB
held a public debate in June 1995, and in written responses to its
April 1995 discussion paper Internal financial control effectiveness,
commentators expressed strong reservations about the practicality of
auditors reporting on directors' opinions on the effectiveness of
internal financial controls. Philip Ashton, chairman of the APB
Internal Control Working Party said: 'Now the Hampel Committee is in
business, it is timely to look at the issues causing difficulty. Also 1
January 1996 was the date on which it became compulsory for directors
to report on internal controls.'

The APB also supports the majority of companies which responded to
Internal financial control effectiveness in calling for a two-year
moratorium on further reforms. 'This will give everyone an opportunity
to see the best way forward, particularly the Hampel Committee one it
gets fully underway,' said Plaistowe.

UNITED KINGDOM: ACCA SEEKS CHARTERED DESCRIPTION

The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants (ACCA) is one step
away from changing its name to the Association of Chartered Certified
Accountants, and calling its members chartered certified accountants.
The move follows a Privy Council decision, that in principle, it has no
objection to the inclusion of the term chartered in the descriptions of
members of any of the accountancy bodies which has a Royal Charter.

ACCA's Council will now seek the approval of members at the May 1996
AGM with a view to making a prompt application to the Privy Council.
Michael Harvey, ACCA's president said: 'The option chartered certified
accountant would enable the Association to retain the ACCA/FCCA
designation and build on the well-established certified brand.'

ACCA confirmed that from 1 January 1996, it is no longer a member of
the accountancy profession's Joint Disciplinary scheme (JDS). ACCA
claims to have paid 27% (around #850,000) of the costs of running the
JDS compared to 12% when funding arrangements were agreed in the early
1980s, despite not having referred one of its 48,000 or so members in
over ten years.

UNITED KINGDOM: PURE CASHFLOW STATEMENT PROPOSED

The Accounting Standards Board (ASB) proposes to introduce a pure
cashflow statements and to drop the present concept of cash
equivalents. FRED 10, Revision of FRS1 cashflow statements, states that
the definition of cash equivalents has been problematic because
treasury management practices can vary widely.

FRED 10 proposes that instead of including cash equivalents -
investments with repayment dates of up to three months, flows of cash
only would be measured - cash comprising cash in hand and deposits
repayable on demand, net of bank overdrafts. If the ASB's proposals are
adopted, the UK would be the only country to use pure cash as the basis
for preparing cashflow statements.

FRED 10 also proposes:

- A new section on management of liquid resources to provide improved
information on treasury activities.

- The order and headings for cashflows to be altered to accord more
closely with those most likely to be used in the directors' own
commentary.

- To tie the cashflow statement more closely into the balance sheet by
focusing on the effect of cashflows on the widely used financial
indicator 'net debt'.

Introducing the Exposure Draft, ASB chairman Sir David Tweedie said:
'The ASB believes that the changes represent a significant step forward
and will be of real benefit to both preparers and users of accounts.
Not the least of the improvements is the move to a pure cashflow
statement, which I am sure is a major advance.'

Comments on FRED 10 are invited by 8 March 1996.

COUNCILS APPROVE MERGER PROPOSALS

The Councils of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales (ICAEW) and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants
have circulated detailed merger proposals to their members for
consultation.

The consultative document, A vision of excellence, sets out the case
for merging the two bodies and explains the key benefits to members of
what it describes as a 'new world class structure'. These benefits
include:

- greater resources to counter increased competition from non-
accountants

- improved services for members and their clients

- increased influence with Government and the European Commission

- common high standards for students in business and practice

- lower subscriptions for many members.

Discussion events have been organised around the UK and overseas and
plans have been made to undertake extensive market research into the
merger. The consultation and research findings will help the Councils
decide whether to ask members to vote on the merger formally at a
Special Meeting in June of this year.

ICAEW president Keith Woodley said: 'I am delighted that our two
Councils have voted in favour of these proposals as I believe that this
is the right way forward for the profession.'

But an ICAEW member based at a Big 6 firm in London told WAR: 'This
would be a step backwards for the profession. Management accountants
will never be treated at the same level as chartered accountants.'

UNITED KINGDOM: EXEMPTION FOR SMALL BUSINESSES ON CARDS

Nine out of ten small companies may be freed from all existing
accounting standards if proposals put forward by a working party of the
Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies (CCAB) are implemented.
The CCAB working party on Big GAAP/Little GAAP's proposed new Financial
reporting standard for smaller enterprises, nicknamed 'Fresse', would
dramatically reduce the disclosure requirements in small companies.

Fresse, which would be issued alongside standards for larger companies,
would replace more than 600 pages of rules with a mere 40. It maintains
the measurement principles in existing standards although they have
been simplified in other areas, and will cover companies entitled to
make use of exemptions under the Companies Act.

Fresse would apply to companies with a turnover of less than #2.8m,
fewer than 50 employees or less than #1.4m of assets but not to
companies where there is a public interest. It could also be applied to
small non-corporate entities.

The closing date for comments is 29 March 1996.

UNITED STATES: AMEX'S VICTORY ON FLORIDA LAW

American Express (Amex) Tax and Business Services prevailed in its
challenge of a Florida statute which prohibited the company's employees
from informing clients that they were Certified Public Accountants
(CPAs).

Previously, the Florida State Board of Accountancy only allowed CPAs to
advertise their certification if they were employed by a licensed
accounting firm with CPA ownership. As a corporation, Amex did not fit
that bill.

Amex's lawsuit against the state board claimed that the Florida statute
was a violation of its employees' constitutional right to free speech.
A Florida federal district court agreed with that charge and issued a
permanent injunction against the state enforcing its statute. 'Telling
consumers that our employees are qualified, trained CPAs is a
(constitutional) right,' said Sarah McKenzie, national director for
Amex. 'This information is important to consumers as they make choices
about their financial advisors.'

McKenzie said that statutes like Florida's were designed to insulate
traditional CPA firms from competition. Although the court's decision
pertains strictly to the state of Florida, she predicted it will have
far reaching effects on the accounting industry.

Florida's attorney general said that the State Board of Accountancy was
disappointed with the court's ruling and had not yet decided whether it
would appeal.

Amex employees provide accounting, tax and financial planning services,
but do not perform any attest functions. Audits and other attestation
engagements remain the sole province of licensed CPA firms.

UNITED STATES: ORANGE COUNTY CLAIMS KPMG WAS NEGLIGENT

Officials of bankrupt Orange County, California recently filed suit
against the county's former auditor, KPMG Peat Marwick. The lawsuit
claims that KPMG was negligent in performing its duties, that the firm
did not adequately warn county administrators of the high-risk nature
of certain investments.

Damages of up to $3bn are sought by Orange County. Defendants to the
action include KPMG partners and principals worldwide.

The negligence claim had been expected for several months. Earlier the
county had sued its former investment adviser, Merrill Lynch for a
similar amount.

KPMG officials said that the claim was just another attempt by the
county to hold someone else responsible for its investment losses. They
stressed that the firm was not hired as an investment adviser of the
county. KPMG's only role was to render judgement on the county's
financial statements and firm officials said the accounts accurately
portrayed Orange County finances.

UNITED STATES: BANKERS PRESS FASB FOR FAS 115 RELIEF

There is nothing like an interest rate swing to change a banker's
perspective.

During 1994, bankers were forced to make difficult decisions about
their investments. Implementing FAS 115, Accounting for certain
investments in debt and equity securities, required banks to classify
their investments as trading securities, available-for-sale or held-to-
maturity. Difference accounting rules applied to each class of
investments.

Some of the banks most volatile investments were classified as held-to-
maturity to insulate bank earnings from price fluctuations. Because of
the banks' stated intent to hold these investments, they were not
required to be written down to market values as bond prices plunged in
1994.

The interest rate scenario improved appreciable in 1995, however, as
did the value of the bankers' investments. So leading up to year-end
1995, bankers lobbied the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB),
for relief from their decisions of a year earlier. FASB accommodated
them by allowing a one-time reassessment and reclassification. Assets
in the held-to-maturity category were allowed to be moved into another
category between 15 November and 31 December 1995.

Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International are to do an Arthur Andersen and

TORIES BRACED FOR MINORITY GOVERNMENT: SENIOR MINISTERS ADMIT MAJOR MAY
LOSE COMMONS MAJORITY BEFORE END OF 1996

   By JAMES BLITZ, Lobby Correspondent

Government ministers yesterday contemplated the probability that Mr
John Major will lead a minority administration later this year, amid
fears that the Conservatives can expect to lose more seats in the House
of Commons.

As left and rightwing Tories indulged in mutual recriminations over the
recent defection of Miss Emma Nicholson, MP for Devon West and
Torridge, to the Liberal Democrats, senior ministers privately admitted
that the government could expect to lose its Commons majority before
the end of 1996 - and that it may rely for survival on the support of
the nine Ulster Unionist MPs.

Ministers played down claims by one left-of-centre Tory that at least
six other MPs were prepared to defect to opposition parties. Yet
several admitted that by-elections triggered by the deaths of MPs would
put the Tories into a Commons minority this year. The departure of Miss
Nicholson means the government can now expect two pending by-elections
to cut its Commons majority to just one, if Sir Richard Body, who
remains outside the Tory whip, is excluded from calculations.

However, despite increasing signs that his party may have to rely on
their support in any No Confidence motion, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern
Ireland secretary, insisted there would be 'no special treatment' for
the UUP.

'I recognise no difference in the essential equation by reason of
events in the last few days or even a longer period,' he told BBC Radio
4's Today programme.

Other ministers, however, were already contemplating the need for
concessions to the UUP, with one privately conceding that relations
with the Ulster parties would be 'critical' to the government's
fortunes.

Calculations about the government's majority coincided with signs that
the delicate truce between left and rightwing Tories appeared to be
tottering in the wake of the defection.

Mr Michael Portillo, defence secretary, launched a strong attack on
Miss Nicholson, rubbishing her claims that the reason for her defection
had been the party's shift to the right.

'It is very silly to say that the party has tilted to the right - that
is completely incredible,' he told BBC radio. 'I think the party is
probably much the same. We have a broad breadth of opinion within the
party.'

Mr John Redwood, last year's beaten Tory leadership challenger, also
attacked the idea of a rightward shift by the government, claiming Mr
Major's cabinet reshuffle last July had promoted left of centre MPs.

However, Sir Edward Heath, former prime minister, rounded on Mr
Portillo, claiming the party had clearly taken an anti-European stance
and that Miss Nicholson's defection should be heeded. 'There is no
doubt at all that the party has moved to the right,' he said. 'That
can't be denied . . . it may be denied, but if it is denied it is a
false denial.'

Mr Peter Temple-Morris, a pro-European backbencher, also demanded a
halt to the 'torrent of personal abuse' heaped on Miss Nicholson and
called on ministers to rise above the warfare between the party's
wings.

'I would just like them to behave as if they were one cabinet, visible
for all to see and not in such a way where undoubtedly the unhappiness
produced has led to two defections in three months. We cannot afford
any more and I trust we will not have any more,' he said.

TAX SELF-ASSESSMENT WILL HIT SMALL BUSINESS, SAYS LABOUR

   By JAMES BLITZ

The Treasury's plan to allow self-employed managers of small businesses
to assess their own income tax liabilities will come under a strong
attack from the Labour party this week amid claims that it will add
significantly to company costs.

Labour claims self-assessment will place new burdens on small
businesses running into hundreds of millions of pounds. It estimates
the scheme will create extra recurrent costs of Pounds 130m to Pounds
250m a year for self-employed business managers and mean big increases
in red tape.

Mr Andrew Smith, Labour's shadow chief secretary, is also concerned the
scheme contains a 'hidden tax bombshell'. He said yesterday the
introduction of self-assessment later this year would increase the
Treasury's tax take by some Pounds 850m in 1997-98.

Labour is expected to raise its objections to the scheme in the Commons
on Thursday when the Finance Bill is published.

Mr Smith said the increase in tax revenue would occur because the
self-employed would make their assessments next year on the basis of
current-year activities rather than those for the previous year.

Because of anticipated increases in inflation and economic growth, the
change to current-year assessment would allow the Treasury to take more
in tax from the self-employed.

'While the principle of self-assessment makes sense, the way the
government is going about it on the current deadlines is a disaster,'
said Mr Smith.

He revealed that Labour would call for aspects of self-assessment to be
delayed to avoid confusion.

But Mr Smith would give no guarantee that Labour would abandon the
self-assessment plans, arguing that a new government might create new
difficulties by reversing changes of such magnitude.

A spokesman for the Inland Revenue confirmed that the government would
receive the additional Pounds 850m in 1997-98. But he said it was a
'one-off shift' that would not be repeated in future years.

'Overall, self-assessment amounts to a clearer system with more
definite deadlines - and one which people will find easier to operate,'
he said.

WALDEGRAVE GETS TOUGH ON SPENDING TO FINANCE TAX CUTS

   By ROBERT PESTON, Political Editor

Remorseless pressure to bring down public spending to finance next
year's widely expected tax cuts has been promised by Mr William
Waldegrave, chief secretary to the Treasury, in a new year interview.

The chief secretary said he had a long-term aim of seeing public
spending fall to around 35 per cent of gross domestic product, compared
with about 42 per cent at present.

He said this should not be seen 'against the background of a slavish
target of numbers' but because of a 'genuine belief that too much is
done (by government) and a good deal of it is act-ually hindering the
economy'.

His views on the potential for shrinking the government's share of the
economy are strikingly different from those of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, who is not persuaded that there is scope to get the
proportion much below 40 per cent of GDP without damaging public
services.

There is also a significant difference between Mr Waldegrave and Mr
Clarke on European monetary union. Mr Clarke believes that the decision
to participate in a single currency is primarily an economic one.
However, Mr Waldegrave said the decision to join was primarily 'an act
of political will and choice'.

He also hinted that Mr John Major's successful campaign to persuade the
EU to study the implications of two-tier monetary union - with only a
small minority of countries joining the proposed single currency - is
motivated by a desire to delay the project.

'I do think that it is possible to imagine technical questions which
will be raised which will worry those who are going in very much,' Mr
Waldegrave said. 'The damage from a badly established union will be
quite considerable.'

The chief secretary also made it clear that he will contest any
criticism he may face in the Scott report on arms sales to Iraq, due to
be published in the next few weeks. Leaked drafts of the report
criticised Mr Waldegrave for failing as a Foreign Office minister in
the late 1980s to announce an apparent softening in the government's
policy on the arms embargo with Iraq.

Mr Waldegrave, who has made further submissions to Lord Justice Scott,
said: 'My conscience is entirely clear.' He would only consider
resigning if he could be persuaded that his 'memory of the whole
business is so wrong'.

He added that it would not only be his memory that was at fault but
that of 'the whole Foreign Office'.

On next year's public expenditure negotiations, he said he would start
visiting ministries with a view to securing cuts in the early spring.

One of the initial targets of his scrutiny will be the Pounds 15bn cost
to government of public bodies at arm's length from ministries and
quangos. He said he was looking for savings of several hundred million
pounds in their running costs. He will also maintain pressure on
spending departments to substitute private finance for
government-financed capital projects. 'In terms of extra cash flow
there is probably more to come from that,' he said.

His other target will be to step up the government's fight against
fraud, especially in the social security budget.

AILING KING FAHD HANDS OVER POWER TO SAUDI PRINCE: MOVE ENDS
SPECULATION OVER SUCCESSION BUT FUELS DOUBT ON RULER'S HEALTH

   By ROULA KHALAF, Middle East Correspondent

Saudi Arabia's King Fahd handed over the running of the government
yesterday to his half-brother, Crown Prince Abdullah, in a development
likely to raise further doubts about the king's health but end
speculation about succession in the kingdom.

A royal order carried by the official Saudi Press Agency said the
73-year-old monarch, who is believed to have suffered a minor stroke
last November, was handing over 'management of government affairs' to
the crown prince while he recuperates.

Prince Abdullah, who is two years younger than the king, is deputy
prime minister and head of the powerful 57,000-man National Guard. He
is seen as more conservative and less internationally minded than the
king, though diplomats said he was unlikely to change the kingdom's
foreign and economic policies.

Saudi Arabia is the world's largest oil exporter and a close ally of
the US. The decree said the prince would take over while the king
enjoyed 'rest and recuperation'.

The decision makes official a role the prince has played since the king
fell ill.

Although he will officially now chair cabinet meetings and represent
the king on official visits, the move may prove temporary if the king's
health improves, diplomats said yesterday.

'It sounds more like a technical move, a kind of regency,' said one
diplomat in the kingdom. 'The king is still king. What we don't know is
how much he will still be involved and this will depend on his health.'

The king left hospital on December 8 after suffering what was
officially termed a 'sudden indisposition' but is known to have been a
stroke.

Diabetic and overweight, King Fahd was seen on television yesterday
aided by a walking stick as he received Crown Prince Abdullah and
Prince Sultan, the defence minister.

Saudi officials yesterday suggested the move was aimed at putting an
end to speculation of a power struggle within the kingdom.

The talk had been fuelled in recent months by two big shocks. The first
was the monarch's illness, the second a car bomb on November 13 which
destroyed a US-staffed Saudi National Guard communications centre in
Riyadh, the capital.

Islamic fundamentalists opposed to the regime have latched on to these
events from their base in London and claimed a power struggle has
broken out in the royal family.

They viewed the bomb attack on the national guards as an attempt to
undermine Crown Prince Abdullah.

Yesterday's move preceded the unveiling of Saudi Arabia's 1996 budget.
Early indications suggested the kingdom would continue public sector
retrenchment, maintaining expenditures at SR150bn (Pounds 25.8bn), the
same as in 1995.

Faced with a cash crunch resulting from the collapse of oil prices and
the cost of the 1990-91 Gulf war, Saudi Arabia has since 1994 embarked
on a policy of cutting government expenditures and raising non-oil
revenues.

CHIRAC CONCEDES DIALOGUE NEEDED ON REFORMS

   By ANDREW JACK

   PARIS


Mr Jacques Chirac, the French president, made a sharp break with the
practice of his predecessor, Mr Francois Mitterrand, on Sunday night by
raising the political content of the country's traditional New Year's
Eve address from its head of state.

In an address lasting nearly 15 minutes and broadcast on most
television news channels, Mr Chirac devoted much of his time to
defending his decisions over the last few months and how they tied in
to his election campaign promises.

He made patriotic play of France's historical mission and global
importance, and its continued commitment to brotherhood, tolerance and
justice.

Referring to the widespread strike action since last November, which
was prompted by his government's proposed social security reforms, he
called the resulting period one of 'crisis'.

In his strongest statement of support for Mr Alain Juppe, he praised
the 'courage and determination' of the prime minister, as well as the
rest of the government.

However, in a sign of implicit criticism, he said that one lesson to be
drawn from the experience was the need for greater dialogue and
consultation - something which he acknowledged had not been
characteristic of France in the past.

Another lesson - in a jibe at his political predecessors - was that 'it
is no longer possible to govern as we have for the last 20 years' with
only piecemeal reforms. He stressed the need for a country able to cope
with 'global competition'.

He said his aim remained to build a 'new France' based on justice,
unity and resonsibility, and his top priority remained to reduce
unemployment - which remains at more than 11.5 per cent.

He placed less emphasis than in a previous television interview last
October on fiscal rigour, but talked about the need to set up a
creative, productive economy. He pledged that taxes - which have risen
since his election - would be cut as soon as possible.

President Chirac made time to discuss the French commitment to Europe -
a point brought home by the EU's flag hanging alongside that of his own
country on the wall behind him.

However, he also stressed the need for change in the administration of
the EU so that it was 'more attentive' to the daily needs of the
French, including their 'social hopes' and the 'real priority' of
employment.

SCALFARO SEEKS CLARITY ON POLLS

   By ROBERT GRAHAM

   ROME


President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has appealed to Italy's political
parties to come forward with clear ideas on how long the government of
Mr Lamberto Dini should last and to give a firm calendar for the life
of the current parliament.

The head of state's appeal was contained in his annual message
delivered on New Year's eve.

The highly political message was delivered in advance of this week's
meeting of the parliamentary group leaders to fix the terms of a debate
on the future of the government following the resignation tendered last
Saturday by Mr Dini, the prime minister.

As expected President Scalfaro rejected the resignation, insisting
parliament must decide. In his message, President Scalfaro reinforced
this point. 'In a few days the debate in the chamber of deputies will
provide the right opportunity to know precisely what the various
political groups want and to see whether a consensus emerges that is
both clear to the general public and useful to the head of state.'

The debate is likely to be staged next week, allowing further time for
the political leaders to negotiate behind the scenes. Until now none of
the main political parties has come forward with a proposal either for
the continuance of the Dini government or a date for general elections.

But Mr Dini, who has been in close touch with the main party leaders,
appeared confident over the weekend that he would remain in office.
Backed by President Scalfaro, he has argued strongly that the country
cannot afford a government crisis and a general election during Italy's
six-month presidency of the European Union which lasts until June.

Despite underlining the importance of parliament, the tone throughout
President Scalfaro's 35-minute New Year's message was of a man who
intended to use his limited constitutional powers to the full. He made
his own preferences plain.

He went out of his way to praise the 11 month premiership of Mr Dini -
so indicating his desire to see the former deputy director of the Bank
of Italy remain at the helm during Italy's EU presidency. He also said
he would like to see the current legislature carry out a proper reform
of the constitution in time for the celebration in 1998 of the 50th
anniversary of its introduction. This was seen as a none too subtle
hint that parliament should not be dissolved before institutional
reform has been tackled.

Yesterday several political parties took exception to what they
regarded as President Scalfaro's overtly partisan stance. In particular
the president's message was attacked by the rightwing National
Alliance, by the Greens and by Reconstructed Communism, which was
formed from the hardline members of the former Communist party.

SAMPAIO LEADS AS PORTUGAL NEARS VOTE

   By PETER WISE

   LISBON


Campaigning for Portugal's presidential election on January 14 began
this week with Mr Jorge Sampaio, the Socialist candidate, showing a
clear lead over Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister for 10 years
until his centre-right Social Democrats were beaten in October's
general election.

Mr Sampaio, a former Socialist party leader who stepped down as mayor
of Lisbon to run for the presidency, was given 41.6 per cent of the
vote in a newspaper poll yesterday, compared with 34.9 per cent for Mr
Cavaco Silva. A weekend poll based on a broader sample of more recent
interviews gave them 50 per cent and 34 per cent respectively.

Since the return of democracy in 1974, Portugal has consistently
elected presidents from the party opposed to the government so that
each acts as a counterweight to the other. Mr Cavaco Silva says that
Portugal will 'capsize' if all political weight is shifted to the
Socialists, who are also dominant in local government.

However, the polls indicate that most voters are inclined to provide
additional support for the Socialists, who are four seats short of a
parliamentary majority, by electing Mr Sampaio. Under Portugal's 'semi-
presidentialist' constitution, the president has the power to dissolve
parliament and call an early election when governments run into
difficulties.

Mr Antonio Guterres, the prime minister, is campaigning for the backing
of a Socialist president. This would help his minority government meet
election commitments both to spend more on social reforms and exercise
the budgetary discipline required to meet the convergence targets for
European economic and monetary union.

Ministers say Mr Cavaco Silva would seize the first opportunity to
dismiss the government if he won the election, although he has pledged
to co-operate fully with the Socialists in the interests of stability.

The former prime minister's attempt at a transition from an aloof
decision-maker to the kind of benevolent figure of tolerance and
concern that Mr Ma rio Soares, the outgoing Socialist president, has
made popular is proving difficult to achieve.

Despite popular respect for his integrity, support for Mr Sampaio, a
less charismatic leader, appears to be based more on disapproval of his
rival, whose government had grown increasingly unpopular before its
defeat, and on backing for Mr Guterres.

The government is avoiding decisive measures, including the
presentation of the 1996 budget, until after the presidential vote. It
hopes the political honeymoon that followed its election can be
prolonged long enough to benefit Mr Sampaio.

RUSSIA PLEDGES TOUGH LINE ON ECONOMY

   By JOHN THORNHILL

   MOSCOW


Russia's economics ministry yesterday pledged it would continue to
pursue a harsh monetary policy designed to stabilise the economy and
cut the monthly rate of inflation to below 2 per cent despite the
strong anti-government protest vote in last month's parliamentary
elections.

However, the ministry's tough stance, contained in an annual economic
forecast, was seemingly at odds with the the softer rhetoric employed
by President Boris Yeltsin in his address to the nation on New Year's
Eve.

'The main task for 1996 is that those in Russia who today are poor
should begin to live better,' he said, promising the government would
rectify the problem of delayed wage and pension payments which has
caused great social distress.

Mr Yeltsin also lashed out at the corruption in financial circles which
was responsible for diverting money intended for social spending.

Last week, Mr Yeltsin criticised the economics ministry, employing
rhetoric reminiscent of the Stalinist era to denounce 'saboteurs' who
were responsible for undermining the reform programme.

He promised to increase payments to pensioners by compensating them for
savings eroded by the hyper-inflation of the early reform years.

Mr Yeltsin's pledges have led some economists to fear that the
government may consider loosening its monetary policy pushing up
inflation early this year. The government may come under intense
pressure to increase spending on social protection to curry electoral
favour before the presidential election in June.

But ministers have repeatedly argued that there is no contradiction
between tight monetary policies and a rise in the standard of living.

PARTIES WEIGH UP RISK AND RESPONSIBILITY

   By ROBERT GRAHAM

Political decisions in Italy are rarely made in a hurry.

No one wishes to assume the responsibility - and risk - of the first
move. This is why the politicians will take their time in deciding the
fate of Prime Minister Lamberto Dini's government even though they have
had ample notice of the administration's limited duration.

Mr Dini tendered his resignation on Saturday to President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro, after approving an additional financial package for the 1996
budget. This was his last self-appointed task.

President Scalfaro has now thrown the responsibility back to parliament
to decide what should happen next. This will take the form of a
parliamentary debate later this week or early next week.

Having acquired a taste of power over the last 11 months, Mr Dini is
more than willing to stay on. Moreover, President Scalfaro, who has the
final say on a date for the next general election, is clearly anxious
the former director general of the Bank of Italy should remain in
office.

President Scalfaro believes it is too late for a big political shake-up
now that Italy has the responsibility (since January 1) of the
presidency of the European Union. He thus wants Mr Dini to remain prime
minister - probably with a revamped cabinet - for the duration of the
six-month presidency. But this seems to be part of a broader strategy
by Mr Scalfaro, a former Christian Democrat interior minister, to allow
parliament to survive until 1997, thus permitting more time for a
recreation of the centre grouping which dominated post-war Italian
politics until 1992.

The parliamentary debate is expected to focus on three broad scenarios:

Mr Dini heads the government to ensure a stable EU presidency and
permit elections around June.

Mr Dini presides over a caretaker government with elections held in
late February or early March.

A broad-based government is formed lasting up to two years to permit a
programme of big institutional reforms.

The first scenario involves several variations. For instance, Mr Dini
could seek to maintain the backing of the centre-left parties, headed
by the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) who supported his government
of non-parliamentarians all last year. This would provide a fragile
majority in parliament unless a prior understanding was reached with
the rightwing alliance headed by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime
minister. The government would be little more than a caretaker, while
the parties indulged in a six-month election campaign.

Alternatively Mr Dini, who has no political base of his own, could try
to broaden the backing for the government to include the small centre
parties in the rightwing alliance. This would have the advantage of
lessening the exposure of the centre-left as the government's main
backer and would provide some chance of parliament pushing through a
few reforms in the next few months. It would also help offset the
destabilising effect of the populist Northern League, which, with
almost 80 deputies, retains considerable power to swing votes.

The second scenario is straight-forward and would mean parliament being
dissolved shortly after the debate on the government's future. Mr Dini
would remain in office but with no real executive power. Given that it
normally takes a good six weeks to two months to form a government
after an election, Italy would be without an effective administration
probably until May.

The third scenario is the most complex. At a minimum it would require a
commitment from the PDS, some of the centre parties and the bulk of Mr
Berlusconi's rightwing alliance to back the idea of carrying out over
the next two years important institutional reforms such as
strengthening the prime minister's position and ending the duplication
of the bicameral system. This would be done either by allowing a
'technical' government to continue as the executive while a special
bicameral commission was formed to draw up the reforms; or a new
government would be formed, drawing ministers from the parties
supporting it. The onus would then be on the government to draw up the
reforms.

Mr Berlusconi has been exploring this idea of a broad-based government
over the Christmas break. His scheduled trial later this month for
corruption probably played a part in his change of mind. But the PDS is
sceptical of his chances, and the rightwing National Alliance (AN), his
main ally, is openly hostile to the idea. The parties themselves are
changing too fast for a broad-based alliance to survive and be useful.

The PDS has the power to force elections simply by refusing to continue
backing Mr Dini; but of late Mr Massimo D'Alema, the party leader, has
dropped his insistence on an early vote. This is because the
PDS-dominated centre-left is increasingly divided on strategy and beset
by doubts about being led in an election by the uncharismatic Mr Romano
Prodi, the Bologna academic and former head of Iri, the state holding
company.

The centre-left staked much on striking an electoral deal with a
movement headed by Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the former Milan magistrate.
But Mr Di Pietro may now be prevented from entering politics because of
his own problems with the law that have arisen as a result of
investigations over his abuse of office before he joined the Milan
magistrates' anti-corruption team.

Against this background, the simplest option for the political parties
is to allow Mr Dini to stay with the excuse that Italy needs an
identifiable government to play its full role as EU chairman. This is a
convenient fig-leaf behind which the politicians can hide their
confusion. But it will merely postpone the day of reckoning at the
ballot-box and is unlikely to provide an authoritative government, even
if Mr Dini has proven to be a skilled and ambitious operator of the
system.

PACT TO OPEN UP STATE CONTRACTS

   By GUY DE JONQUIERES

   LONDON


Public procurement contracts valued at several billion dollars a year
will be thrown open to international competition under a World Trade
Organisation agreement which took effect yesterday.

The agreement covers more countries and purchasers - and applies to a
wider range of contracts - than existing rules agreed under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 15 years ago.

In addition to covering services for the first time, the new rules
extend to procurement by sub-central purchasers, such as states,
provinces, departments and utilities, as well as to central
governments.

Though not all WTO members are obliged to participate in the agreement,
it has been ratified by more than 20 governments, including the US, the
European Union's 15 members, Japan, South Korea and Switzerland.
Singapore and several other countries plan to subscribe to it.

The accord excludes defence contracts, EU telecoms and the US regional
and urban public transport sector.

The complex new rules set a variety of thresholds, denominated in
Special Drawing Rights, above which contracts must be opened to
competition. The threshold for central government procurement is
SDR130,000 (Pounds 125,000), for sub-central purchasers about
SDR200,000, and for utilities roughly SDR400.000.

The agreement also lays down specified tendering procedures, to ensure
that foreign bidders and foreign goods and services are treated on the
same basis as those in the purchaser's home country.

GENE CLONING RAISES HOPES

   By DANIEL GREEN

   LONDON


A gene that has been linked with obesity has been cloned, a step that
brings closer a new generation of treatments for the chronically
overweight.

Two companies, Millennium of the US and Roche of Switzerland, describe
the cloning - effectively the manufacture - of the 'ob' gene in the
latest issue of the journal Cell.

The ob gene triggers the manufacture of a protein, leptin, which last
year was been shown to affect the weight of mice with no significant
side effects. But the relationship between leptin and weight in humans
has not yet been established precisely.

The two companies claim to have narrowed research to the gene's
activity in the brain, but further work is probably needed before
development of an obesity drug based on the ob gene could start.

Last year, the US biotechnology company Amgen paid Dollars 20m for to
the Rockefeller Institute in New York, which first identified the gene,
for the rights to products arising from it.

EUROPEAN PRESS REVIEW: BEACON FOR EMERGING DEMOCRACY - RUSSIA

   By JOHN THORNHILL

Democracy can be a baffling business. In Soviet times, Russia's voters
could vote for only one party whose political philosophy was force-fed
to them from birth. In last month's parliamentary elections they had a
choice of 43 parties with each one claiming to have the only answer to
Russia's woes.

Such a drastic democratic upheaval has clearly left many Russians
bewildered and may help explain why more than one-fifth of them opted
for the familiar and voted for the return of the Communists. But the
elections also proved an education for Russia's political leaders who
are now scrambling to learn the lessons before the all-important
presidential elections scheduled in six months' time.

The Magnitogorsk Worker, the local newspaper for the Urals industrial
town founded as part of Stalin's industrialisation drive, encapsulated
many of the confusions and controversies that came to dominate the
campaign. In so doing it reflected, in microcosm, the social pain and
ideological uncertainties that continue to bedevil Russia.

The newspaper, founded in 1930 and still proudly bearing a Soviet
emblem on its front page urging the proletariat of the world to unite,
provided full, lively, and generally fair coverage of the campaign,
encouraging those who see the media as an important factor in the
development of a healthy civil society.

Like most of Russia's local newspapers, the Magnitogorsk Worker could
have been under enormous pressure from many quarters. The list of six
parliamentary candidates for the city seat included the deputy head of
the local administration and a director of the steel combine which
employs 60,000 workers and dominates the region's economy.

But Mr Georgy Tikhonov, the chief editor, argued that the newspaper's
role was simply to provide an objective forum for the debate and
encourage readers to participate in the vote. 'This newspaper does not
agitate for or against particular candidates. . . it agitates for
something else: for the widest possibility for people to discuss openly
one or another candidacy and the course of the campaign itself. Read,
think, and make your choice]' the newspaper stated.

In comparison with most western newspapers, the Magnitogorsk Worker
provided few reports and opinions from its journalists but carried
extensive personal contributions from the candidates and scores of
letters from its readers.

Mr Alexander Pochinok, the incumbent deputy who represented the then
pro-government Russia's Choice party in the previous vote in 1993, was
the dominant figure in the campaign for one of Russia's 225
directly-elected seats.

Although he supported the government's harsh monetary policies which
many critics blamed for Russia's social ills, Mr Pochinok boldly
launched his campaign by concentrating on social problems and promising
to improve the lot of the elderly.

But his attempt to seize the mantle of social concern was fiercely
contested by the Communist candidate who wrote an emotional tirade
against the government's policies and promised a restoration of the
certainties of the Soviet era.

These themes were echoed in the opinions of the newspapers' readers who
expressed impassioned and disparate views.

'During the war, millions were evacuated here and resettled. They were
given work and a roof but now they have been thrown out. Every honest
person will vote for the Communists,' said one.

'I do not want to return to the miserable plague-stricken camp of the
past but I fear the thorny road forward to civilisation,' commented
another.

One reader planned not to participate in the elections at all given
they were merely a 'political spectacle distracting the country from
its true problems' while another condemned the newspaper itself for
giving too much space to the 'so-called democrats'.

The Magnitogorsk Worker made clear it was aware of some dirty electoral
tactics during the campaign but did not identify who was responsible
for them in order not to prejudice opinions.

In the week before the vote, it carried an item about a pensioner who
had been contacted by someone claiming to represent the local telephone
company.

'Vote correctly and your telephone bill will be paid in advance for a
year,' the mysterious caller promised.

On the eve of the elections, the newspaper urged its readers to go to
the polls although it recognised that many voters were still confused
by the extraordinary range of parties on the ballot paper.

The results were slow to trickle in and the Magnitogorsk Worker did not
publish the preliminary outcome until three days after the poll. The
electors of Magnitogorsk had returned the pro-market Mr Pochinok as
their local candidate but they had also lodged a strong protest vote
backing Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic
party and the Communists in the simultaneous ballot for the seats
assigned on the basis of proportional representation.

In all, 39 parties - including Russia's Choice - failed to garner
more than the 5 per cent of the vote required to win any of the 225
seats in the 450-strong parliament allocated by proportional
representation. Mr Pochinok, for example, has been elected as a
representative of a party which will be unable to form its own faction
in parliament.

One voter told the newspaper: 'Voting is most democratic. But you must
write that Hitler also came to power in Germany by democratic means. We
must go forward to the presidential elections but people must be
vigilant.'

ZEROUAL PICKS LITTLE-KNOWN DIPLOMAT AS PM

   By ROULA KHALAF

Algerian President Liamine Zeroual has chosen a little-known career
diplomat as the country's new prime minister.

Mr Zeroual, elected president in November, on Sunday named Mr Ahmed
Ouyahia, his 43-year-old head of cabinet, to replace Mr Mokdad Sifi who
had been asked to stay on until the end of the year.

Most Algerians met Mr Ouyahia, who comes from the Berber province of
Tizi-Ouzou, for the first time when he appeared on state television
last July to read a statement telling them that the last round of talks
with the banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) had collapsed. The FIS
has been battling the government since 1992. Mr Ouyahia is not believed
to have taken a lead part in the negotiations.

That he is among the youngest prime ministers the country has known
points to an attempt by Mr Zeroual to reach out to a younger generation
in a country where more than 70 per cent of the people are under the
age of 30. But Mr Ouyahia's appointment sheds little light on Mr
Zeroual's post election politics.

'Zeroual has opted for a safe pair of hands, a skilled functionary
rather than a political heavyweight,' said one Algerian expert
yesterday. 'It means the composition of the government is not what
really concerns him.'

Mr Ouyahia's government is not expected to last longer than a year
because Mr Zeroual has promised legislative elections, although he has
yet to commit himself to a specific date.

The prime minister's task will centre on overseeing economic reforms
agreed with the International Monetary Fund and preparing for the
elections.

Mr Ouyahia is perhaps best known among his colleagues for arranging an
accord to end the conflict between Tuareg rebels and the Mali
government in 1992, a task which won him recognition as a skilful
negotiator.

He was named ambassador to Mali to oversee implementation of the
accord, before becoming state secretary for co-operation and Maghreb
affairs in 1993.

Although some experts have suggested the choice of a diplomat with
negotiating skills points to a determination on the part of the
president to seek national reconciliation, any negotiations with the
FIS or other opposition parties which opposed the presidential election
are likely to be conducted directly from the president's office rather
than that of the prime minister.

In a system in which the presidency enjoys wide powers, the prime
minister's office is entrusted with more of a management role.

JAPAN PUBLIC PRESSED ON LOAN BAILOUT

   By GERARD BAKER

   TOKYO


Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's prime minster, has urged an increasingly
sceptical Japanese public to accept the government's plan to spend more
than Y685bn (Pounds 4.37bn) in bailing out the country's failed housing
loan companies.

In a New Year message to the nation, Mr Murayama signalled the start of
what is likely to be a fierce political struggle over the bailout in
the new parliamentary session which begins later this month.

The prime minister acknowledged the unpopularity of the plan, which
will cost every individual in the country at least Y5,500, but said it
had been an unavoidable and 'painful' decision.

He promised a full investigation into the causes of the failure of the
seven companies. 'I will try from now on to shed light on the entire
problem,' he added.

Last month the cabinet agreed to allocate Y685bn from next year's
budget to pay for the cost of partially reimbursing creditors of the
bankrupt housing lenders. The government also committed itself to
spending more if the final costs of liquidation turn out to be greater
than is forecast.

The companies, which were established by the leading banks in the
1970s, are on the verge of collapse under a pile of nonperforming loans
which were advanced mostly in a bout of reckless lending to the
property sector during the bubble economy of the late 1980s.

Popular opposition to the principle of spending taxpayers' money has
escalated since the decision was announced and will be exploited by
opposition parties when the parliamentary discussion of the national
budget begins at the end of January.

Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the newly elected leader of the main opposition New
Frontier party, signalled his determination at the weekend to oppose
the bailout if the government did not provide a satisfactory and
detailed account of who was responsible for the costly mess.

The government has already attempted to propitiate the public's anger
by hastily removing the senior bureaucrat at the ministry of finance,
Mr Kyosuke Shinozawa. Mr Shinozawa, the administrative vice minister
for finance, resigned last week, in part to take responsibility for the
housing loan problem.

But the opposition wants the blame for the fiasco to be spread much
more liberally among both politicians and bureaucrats.

In its sights are Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the finance minister, and most
intriguingly, Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, the international trade minister
and leader of the Liberal Democratic party, the largest coalition
partner. Mr Hashimoto was finance minister during the period when most
of the reckless lending of the housing loan companies was undertaken.

In 1990 the finance ministry issued guidelines to all financial
institutions to curtail their lending to property-related companies.
But the instructions did not apply to the housing lenders which
continued to pour money into highly speculative real estate projects.

The finance ministry has promised a full inquiry into the circumstances
of the housing lenders' demise, and has promised that those found
responsible, bankers, politicians and bureaucrats, will be held to
account.

But even a spate of resignations may not prove enough in the current
political heat. Many members of the socialist party, the second largest
coalition member, are profoundly unhappy about the bailout, as are some
officials in the finance ministry.

If the political pressure intensifies, some members of the coalition
may break ranks and oppose the deal.

Defeat for the government on such a crucial part of its budget plans
for 1996 would have potentially disastrous consequences for its
viability.

INDONESIA'S CONGLOMERATES LOOK TO MARKET FORCES

   By GREG EARL

   JAKARTA


Indonesia's big conglomerates, long regarded as 'crony capitalists'
receiving government favours, are becoming much more dependent on
market forces for their growth, according to a study.

The study of sales and asset growth of the country's top groups,
conducted by the Indonesian Business Data Centre, a private agency,
also shows that 300 businesses are responsible for about half the
country's gross domestic product.

The centre's director, Mr Christianto Wibisono, said the study showed a
distinct move away from reliance on government-awarded licences for
business growth in Indonesia. He said only 27 of the groups were now
dependent on managed trading and monopoly arrangements although many of
the larger groups had been established under those business conditions.

The 300 groups are estimated to have increased sales by 15 per cent in
1994 to Dollars 74bn (Pounds 48bn).

The figures point to some increased concentration in the hands of the
largest groups with the 10 largest recording a 17 per cent increase in
sales to Dollars 26bn. There were 31 groups with total sales of Dollars
350m, accounting for 55 per cent of total sales, whereas in 1993 there
were estimated to have been 24 groups with that level of sales
accounting for 49 per cent of total revenue.

Concentration is more evident on an assets basis with 56 groups
controlling three quarters of the Dollars 118bn in total assets of the
300 businesses.

The dominance of the economy by people of Chinese descent is underlined
by the fact that only 79 of the 300 groups are owned by ethnic
Indonesians and 203 by non-ethnic Indonesians, predominantly Chinese.

While there are few surprises among the company's largest companies,
several new players are fast emerging, with 11 groups estimated to have
grown by 50 per cent in 1994.

CONSERVATIVE ABDULLAH TAKES REINS OF POWER

   By ROULA KHALAF

Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah, who was yesterday entrusted with
the running of the government by his half-brother King Fahd, has been
described as more conservative than the king, less likely to
accommodate the west and possibly prone to pumping less oil to raise
prices.

However, as experts and diplomats were quick to point out, Saudi Arabia
run by the crown prince is likely to follow the same economic and
foreign affairs policies the west has become accustomed to under King
Fahd.

If the king's health improves, the handing over of the running of the
government may be no more than a temporary measure and, until Crown
Prince Abdullah takes over for good, King Fahd will continue to have
the final word on big decisions.

One of more than 30 surviving sons of the late King Abdul Aziz, the
71-year-old crown prince is known as a traditional bedouin who enjoys
important ties to the tribes of Saudi Arabia. The fact that he had a
different mother from the king's other powerful brothers has meant that
he comes from a less prominent branch than the other sons of King Abdul
Aziz.

But as the closest in age to King Fahd, he was named crown prince when
the latter took over in 1982. Although this has been a source of
rivalry with the rest of the clan, the sons of Abdul Aziz are known to
stick together when times get rough.

The crown prince is well respected and known for a stutter which seems
to disappear when giving public speeches. The bedouin base is his main
source of strength. Since 1963, he has commanded the National Guard, a
largely bedouin force which looks after internal security and acts as
counterweight to the army.

In view of his strong links to Syria and the Palestinians, as well as a
reported reluctance to allow American troops to set up their base in
Saudi Arabia during the 1990 Gulf war, the crown prince is believed to
be less internationally minded than his half-brother. He is not known
to speak English, for example, and has played a role in cultivating
links with the Arab world.

This, however, say diplomats, is unlikely to have a bearing on the
Kingdom's close ties to the west, especially the US. 'The US alliance
is a vital strategic alliance which the Saudis will not do much to
change,' a diplomat said.

Moreover, according to Saudi observers, the crown prince played a
prominent part in drumming up public support within the Kingdom for the
Gulf war.

'He is more decisive than the king but less reflective perhaps,' said
one veteran Saudi observer who knows the crown prince. 'The king is
very cautious and tends to see procrastination as a virtue. Abdullah is
less hesitant in his style and quicker to judge.'

Such a style, said the observer, may translate into more forceful
dealings with Islamic fundamentalists who have bombarded the kingdom
with faxes from a propaganda base in London.

Islamic dissidents are also suspected of having perpetrated the
November 13 bomb attack on a US-staffed Saudi National Guard
communications centre in Riyadh.

As the budget unveiled yesterday suggests, economic reforms started in
1994 will continue. Faced with collapse of oil prices, Saudi Arabia has
had to clamp down on spending in recent years, give the private sector
a larger role and boost non-oil revenues.

In an address to the nation, Crown Prince Abdullah said: 'No doubt you
know the financial situation that emerged from the (1991) Gulf war and
that your government had (earlier) promised to continue its treatment
so matters could return to what they used to be - strength and
balance.'

The kingdom in recent years has been committed to keeping crude output
at 8m barrels a day in order to avoid a repeat of the mid 1980s, when
it was faced with falling prices and falling production. Diplomats said
yesterday that the crown prince was in the 1970s believed to favour a
policy of holding back production.

'I think the crown prince will continue the policy of keeping oil
prices stable, and the kingdom cannot relax on the economic front but
will have to continue with reforms,' a diplomat said.

As reforms are pursued, however, diplomats said that for as long as the
crown prince was only acting on behalf of the king, he would have to
find a way to accommodate the king's other prominent brothers to
minimise friction.

This may mean that he will resort to consultation and seek the
co-operation of powerful members such as Prince Sultan, defence
minister and next in line of succession.

TALKS TO RESUME ON US BUDGET IMPASSE

   By PATTI WALDMEIR

   WASHINGTON


US President Bill Clinton will meet congressional Republican leaders
later today to resume talks on ending the protracted federal budget
dispute, after extended negotiations over the New Year weekend failed
to yield agreement either on balancing the budget, or on the more
immediate problem of ending the partial government shutdown.

Mr Clinton and Republicans met throughout Saturday and Sunday, before
recessing for New Year's Day. Both sides said no significant decisions
were taken during those negotiations, which focused on outlining areas
of disagreement.

But Mr Bob Dole, Senate majority leader, said negotiators were now
ready to 'start making the tough decisions'. And there were signs of
some flexibility from radical freshmen Republicans in Congress: several
of them, interviewed on weekend television programmes, made clear that
they were willing to compromise on the Dollars 245bn (Pounds 159bn) tax
cut included in their plan, saying balancing the budget was more
important than cutting taxes. Mr Clinton favours a much more modest tax
cut.

Mr Mike McCurry, the White House spokesman, said today's negotiations
would focus on 'trade-offs' between cuts in healthcare spending, taxes
and welfare needed to balance the budget over seven years, as agreed by
both sides in November. There was no sign at the weekend that the two
sides had resolved the basic philosophical dispute which underlies the
budget impasse: whether to shift power away from the federal government
to the states, as the Republicans want; and whether to curb guarantees
of healthcare for the poor and elderly.

Both issues are likely to influence the outcome of this year's
presidential election campaign, which will soon shift into top gear
with a concentration of state presidential primary elections in
February and March.

Parallel efforts will resume today to solve the more immediate problem
of getting federal employees back to work, and ending the shutdown,
which has already lasted more than a fortnight.

The President and First Lady spent New Year's Eve and Day away from the
frustrations of the budget impasse, celebrating with 1,000 friends at
the Hilton Head resort in South Carolina, where they attended a
traditional New Year seminar to debate subjects such as 'morals,
manners, and today's pop culture' and 'politics, media and the decline
of civility'.

RHODES' HEIRS RETURN TO ZAMBIA'S COPPER MINES: AFTER 25 YEARS OF
NATIONALISATION, BOARDROOMS IN JOHANNESBURG AND LONDON MAY AGAIN
DETERMINE THE FUTURE OF ITS MAIN INDUSTRY

   By TONY HAWKINS

Cecil John Rhodes would have relished the irony.

Twenty five years after Kenneth Kaunda, Zambia's founding president,
nationalised the country's copper mines, the government of President
Frederick Chiluba may be on the verge of taking the first step towards
meeting its promise to put the industry back into the private sector.

Negotiations with Anglo American Corporation for a feasibility study
for the development of the Konkola copper mining project are close to
conclusion, say industry officials.

It would be a move as rich in symbolism as the 1969 take-over itself,
seen at the time as heralding a new era for a country that was once
little more than a fiefdom of Rhodes' British South Africa Company.

Rhodes' vision of the company blazing a commercial trail from the Cape
to Cairo, in the name of an empire run by Englishmen, 'is now buried -
I hope and pray, never to rise again in this part of Africa,' declared
Mr Kaunda, architect of what turned out a disastrous socialist
programme.

Once again, however, boardrooms in Johannesburg and London could
determine the development of an industry still at the heart of Zambia's
economy, accounting for more than 90 per cent of export earnings.

With reserves at the Nchanga copper mine, which supplies ore to the
state-owned Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), likely to be
exhausted by the end of the decade, the government is under mounting
pressure to give the go-ahead for the Dollars 600m (Pounds 390m)
Konkola project.

Although widely anticipated, the decision to invite the South African
mining house, which has a 27.3 per cent stake in ZCCM, to prepare a
study and lead a consortium to develop the new mine will be
controversial, not just because Anglo American is being invited back.
The Konkola decision will also have far-reaching implications for the
privatisation of ZCCM itself.

While Zambia's privatisation programme has accelerated in the past year
 - by the end of September, 87 out of 217 business units had been
processed, resulting in a significant inflow of new investment and
expertise - progress in dealing with the politically sensitive copper
mining industry has been slow.

Whereas privatisation of dozens of small state-owned businesses has
passed off with little controversy, the sale of the crown jewels, in
the form of ZCCM, is a different matter, not least because Mr Kaunda is
back on the campaign trail, preparing to contest next October's
presidential elections.

United Nations Conference on Trade and Development figures, published
last month in the World Investment Report, estimate an inflow of more
than Dollars 350m in new foreign investment since the 1991 elections.
In the last year a number of multinationals have returned to, or
expanded operations in, Zambia by buying state-owned companies.

The list includes Tate & Lyle in sugar, Unilever and HJ Heinz in food
processing and toiletries, the Commonwealth Development Corporation in
cement and agriculture, South African Breweries in brewing and Anglo
American in hotels.

The net result is that Zambia attracted more foreign investment in
1991/94 than any other sub-Saharan country, except oil exporters
Nigeria and Angola.

Nevertheless, the announcement of ZCCM's privatisation just months
before elections may seriously damage the prospects of Mr Chiluba's
Movement for Multiparty Democracy.

The past four years of structural adjustment have been extremely
painful, with falling per capita incomes, rising unemployment, high
inflation and interest rates and plummeting industrial production.

That all of this was necessary to turn around an economy brought to its
knees by 27 years of mismanagement by Mr Kaunda's United National
Independence party (UNIP) may count for little when voters come to cast
their ballots.

Economic reform would have paid dividends far more rapidly had the
privatisation programme, now beginning to show real results, been
implemented both sooner and more efficiently; had the country not had
two droughts; and, most important, had the copper mines been able to
exploit a period of strong demand and high prices.

Figures for the first nine months of 1995 point to copper output of
about 325,000 tonnes this year, down 8 per cent on 1994 and less than
half the average of over 700,000 tonnes a year in the late 1960s.

In cost of production terms, ZCCM is in the top 10 per cent of global
producers. Competitiveness will deteriorate further when costs grow as
Nchanga nears the end of its economic life, and the industry suffers
from the cumulative effects of undercapitalisation, inadequate skills,
reinvestment and maintenance spending, and weak management.

If all goes to plan, Konkola will be developed as a joint venture
between the government, whose contribution is likely to take the form
of providing already existing smelting and refining capacity - thereby
further weakening the rump of ZCCM itself - and a Anglo-led
consortium, which may take some 60 per cent of the equity in the
scheme.

While such an arrangement makes sound commercial sense, it will leave
Mr Chiluba open to the criticism of privatising ZCCM by stealth.

An agreement in principle to develop Konkola, however, will reassure an
increasingly restive donor community.

The response from the finance minister, Mr Ronald Penza, struck an
equivocal note, speaking of the need for 'the utmost caution' in
privatising the mines.

'We must have the necessary political support,' he said - which was
interpreted by some donors as political shorthand for more delay.

SRI LANKA'S WAR EUPHORIA FADES

   By AMAL JAYASINGHE

   COLOMBO


The euphoria that erupted when Sri Lanka's military scored a
significant victory last month over separatist Tamil rebels in their
northern stronghold of Jaffna has sharply diminished with steep price
increases coming into effect in the New Year to pay mounting war bills.

President Chandrika Kumaratunga yesterday promised to press ahead with
a carrot-and-stick strategy to end more than two decades of ethnic
violence which has claimed more than 50,000 lives.

'The economic cost of the war will have an all-round effect in terms of
higher prices,' Mr GL Peiris, deputy finance minister, said. 'This is
a war for peace, so there is no question that we have to find the
resources for it.'

The government estimates that the war against the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) will cost Dollars 760m (Pounds 495m) this year, up
from a provisional Dollars 640m in 1995.

The seemingly unending fighting was felt by the tiny Colombo Stock
Exchange, which shed 33 per cent of its value during 1995. Amid falling
foreign reserves, the Sri Lankan rupee depreciated by 8 per cent
against the dollar in 1995.

Yesterday the government lifted a ban on local banks raising capital
abroad, in an attempt to reduce domestic interest rates, which last
month galloped to 105 per cent amid a cash flow crisis.

It is also raising telecommunications charges by 20 per cent, bus fares
by 50 per cent and electricity tariffs by 20 to 100 per cent, depending
on the rate of consumption.

However, Mr AS Jayewardena, the central bank governor, said the
economic picture should improve in 1996, with foreign capital inflows
expected to rise with the sale of state enterprises.

The government is hoping to attract Dollars 420m in foreign capital
from privatisation, including the sale of the telecommunications
operator and the national airline, AirLanka. The projections are
considered too optimistic by private analysts.

Government politicians said the rising prices and the government's
failure to turn the military success into a political victory had
turned initial enthusiasm into despondency.

Despite the fall of Jaffna, the Tigers have shown that they are still
able to carry out spectacular guerrilla attacks using suicide bombers.
Army camps and convoys have been targeted by lone Tiger guerrillas
laden with explosives.

Tamils who fled the fighting in Jaffna are sheltered in areas of the
country's north still under rebel dominance. The Tigers say they will
not allow civilians to cross over to government-held areas of Jaffna,
though defence analysts say that doing so would help the Tigers to go
home and revert to hit-and-run attacks against the army.

The military on the other hand is ill-equipped to supply its
35,000strong force in Jaffna because all land routes to the region are
dominated by the rebels. They depend on the minuscule air force and the
navy.

Mr Anuruddha Ratwatte, deputy defence minister, said the army would
soon open a land route to Jaffna. It would mean a fresh offensive that
would cost many more lives, officials said, and the army was already
bracing for it.

ZEDILLO RESHUFFLES CABINET

   By DANIEL DOMBEY

   MEXICO CITY


A year to the day after he lost his finance minister in the fall-out
from Mexico's botched devaluation, President Ernesto Zedillo last week
made further changes to a government still struggling with the
unpopularity unleashed by the currency crisis.

Mr Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza, who as energy minister was criticised for
links to the old guard of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party,
has been replaced, along with Ms Norma Samaniego, the country's
comptroller general, who was thought to be keeping too low a profile to
get to grips with Mexico's allegedly rampant corruption. Mr Carlos
Salomon, the head of Mr Zedillo's press office and frequent target of
complaints about the administration's news management at times when
speculation about government changes unsettled the peso, has also been
removed.

The alterations leave key economic posts unchanged and do not indicate
any big shift in strategy. While the new energy secretary, Mr Jesus
Reyes Heroles, spent much of the previous administration advocating a
more interventionist economic approach, the new comptroller general, Mr
Arsenio Farell, helped push through the wage-labour pacts that then
provided the centrepiece of economic policy.

Mr Zedillo's supporters claim the alterations draw a line under the
political difficulties of the government's first year and set the stage
for further reform. But other observers deem the changes a tardy
reaction to months of criticism.

'This is a defensive move. It does not take the initiative as a more
thorough going reshuffle would have done,' said Mr Juan Molinar, a
politics professor at El Colegio de Mexico, a graduate research
institution.

Mr Zedillo does not face a nationwide electoral test until
congressional elections due in 1997. But he can ill afford a repetition
this year of 1995's election results, which saw the main right-wing
opposition party establish control over roughly a third of local
government, and win three of five governorship elections.

With the government predicting an economic recovery of only 3 per cent
growth this year, Mr Zedillo's new appointees will find themselves the
focus of added attention in their tasks of managing the government's
relationship with the press, reducing bureaucratic profligacy and
reforming and attracting new investment to the country's energy sector.

FT GUIDE TO 1996


JANUARY

1st Italy takes over the presidency of the European Union, the EU's
customs union with Turkey starts, and Copenhagen begins its term as
European Cultural Capital. Austria celebrates its 1,000th anniversary
as a nation this year.

8th The return of George Michael, whose new single, Jesus To A Child,
goes on sale today. It is his first release since he ended his contract
with Sony Music, and also the first record release for DreamWorks, run
by its billionaire co-founder, David Geffen.

12th - 17th Fifth World Hot Air Airships Championships in Aosta, Italy.

14th Portuguese presidential elections - first round. Outgoing
President Mario Soares, who is completing his second five-year term,
cannot stand again.

17th Silvio Berlusconi, leader of the Forza Italia movement, goes on
trial in Milan, charged with bribing officials of the Guardia di
Finanza (financial police). A guilty verdict could destroy Forza Italia
and damage the right-wing alliance of which it is the core.

19th Annual summit of Comesa (Common Market of Eastern and Southern
Africa) in Windhoek.

Japan - US aviation talks in Tokyo.

20th Palestinians elect their own assembly for the first time in
history. Over a million registered voters in Gaza and the West Bank
will choose a legislative council and a president of the council.
Yassir Arafat leads the betting to become president. His Fatah party is
expected to do less well, but will almost certainly emerge as the
single biggest bloc.

21st The approximate start of Ramadan, the Islamic month of fasting.
The precise timing depends on the first sighting of the crescent moon.
Office hours in some countries are limited.

23rd Another Milanese corruption trial. Giorgio Armani, Gianfranco
Ferre and other Italian fashion stars face the court charged with
corruption over allegations that fashion houses paid tax inspectors for
lenient audits.

28th Superbowl XXX in Phoenix closes the American football season.

FEBRUARY

1st - 6th The annual gathering of the political and business clans at
the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

2nd Daiwa Bank due to withdraw from the US for concealing bond trading
losses.

7th Haiti continues its crawl towards democracy, as President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide hands over power to Mr Rene Preval, his
ideological clone, who won the December election. But Mr Aristide is
not ready for retirement and will stand again in 2000.

9th A look at one of the few artistic phenomena to have run the course
of the century: 'Abstraction in the 20th century: Total Risk, Freedom,
Discipline', an exhibition at New York's Guggenheim Museum until May
12.

14th The cricket World Cup starts, to be played in India, Pakistan and
Sri Lanka. Traditionally the World Cup chains most of south Asia to the
television set while evoking only modest interest elsewhere.

Now is the time to claim that you are the long lost heir to the Tsarist
crown. At New York's Metropolitan Museum from the 16th, the exhibition
Faberge in America features Imperial Easter Eggs commissioned by the
last Tsars. Later in February, the remains of Russia's final Tsar,
Nicholas II, will be buried in St Petersburg.

18th Polish referendum on methods of privatisation.

19th The Chinese Year of the Rat begins. Rat years have been auspicious
for Japanese stock prices.

20th A good day for rice growers outside Indonesia. This year Idul
Fitri, the celebration at the end of Ramadan, the Islamic fasting
month, falls before the main Indonesian rice harvest is completed. Rice
demand peaks during Idul Fitri, so the country's rice bowl managers are
scouring the world for supplies.

20th New Hampshire opens the US presidential primary season proper,
though Iowa will have chosen the first delegates in party caucuses on
February 12. Bill Clinton is unopposed on the Democratic side so the
main interest centres on whether any Republican can stop Senator Bob
Dole. After New Hampshire the primaries come thicker, faster and
earlier than ever, with 24 states holding them by March 26. The two
main parties' nominations could thus be decided by Easter.

MARCH

1st - 2nd Heads of state meet for the first ever Asian-EU Summit in
Bangkok.

2nd Alan Greenspan's second four-year term as chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board expires. President Bill Clinton will probably nominate
him for a third term, in order to minimise disruption in the financial
markets during the election campaign.

3rd Spain holds general elections a year before schedule, with the
conservative Popular party expecting its first crack at government.
Knee-deep in scandals, Felipe Gonzalez's minority Socialist government
could not postpone the day any longer, as its allies have walked out.
But Gonzalez is still a man to watch, and the outcome could be closer
than the conservatives think.

8th United Nations troops to leave Rwanda.

Japan's budget to be passed at an ordinary parliamentary session.

15th - 17th Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson formally hands over
power to his successor Goran Persson at a Social Democratic party
congress.

16th - 17th Robert Mugabe seeks a new term in Zimbabwean presidential
elections.

Gianni Agnelli, 74, is expected to hand over as Fiat chairman to Cesare
Romiti, 72, perhaps some time around Agnelli's 75th birthday on March
12. Romiti, only the second non - family chairman in Fiat's history,
will preside over an interregnum, probably preparing for the fourth
generation: Giovanni Alberto, Gianni's nephew.

23rd Taiwan holds its first presidential election by universal suffrage.

25th - 27th Inter - American Development Bank annual meeting in Buenos
Aires.

29th The EU's inter-governmental conference to review the Maastricht
treaty opens in Turin. The conference later switches to monthly
meetings between EU foreign ministers. The IGC will consider beefing up
the EU's common foreign and security policy, and extending powers to
the European Parliament. Germany is leading calls for more majority
voting, but the UK is resisting. Insiders therefore predict an IGC
deadlock in late 1996, followed by an agreement with a new government
after the UK general election, to be held by April 1997.

APRIL

1st The world's largest bank, the newly merged Bank of Tokyo -
Mitsubishi, opens. The bank will not just be big - by Japanese
standards it will also be financially strong, with one of the lowest
proportions of non-performing loans on its balance sheet and a wide
presence in international markets.

The merger is expected to herald a broader consolidation of the
Japanese banking industry, as the other large banks seek partners to
enable them to compete with the new giant.

1st China plans to slash import tariffs on 4,000 items to an average 23
per cent in its quest for WTO membership.

9th - 12th International Atomic Energy Agency conference in Vienna on
10 years after the Chernobyl disaster

11th Uniquely in recent European history, a former prime minister goes
on trial charged with complicity in a murder. Giulio Andreotti of Italy
faces a Perugia court over the death in 1979 of the journalist Mino
Pecorelli.

11th - 12th US Masters golf in Augusta

14th South Korean parliamentary elections

15th - 16th European Bank for Reconstruction and Development annual
meeting in Sofia.

15th - 16th Ministerial meeting between the EU and Rio Group countries
in Cochabamba, Bolivia.

16th - 18th President Clinton visits Japan.

20th to May 11th Unctad four-yearly conference in Midrand, South
Africa. The heads of state of 187 countries are invited.

21st Queen Elizabeth II turns 70

India will probably go to the polls in April for a general election
unlikely to deliver a strong, single party government. The campaign
will be dominated by opposition allegations of Congress party
corruption. Congress will portray the right-wing, Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata party as being divisively based on religion. Economic
issues may not feature heavily, aside from BJP appeals to 'economic
nationalism'.

30th Deadline for completing negotiations on liberalising basic
telecommunications services, under auspices of the World Trade
Organisation.

MAY

9th The day by which South Africa has to unveil its new constitution.
Among the issues to be resolved are whether there will still be a
government of national unity and the powers of the provinces.

9th - 20th The Cannes Film Festival

16th The Dominican Republic votes in a presidential election which, for
the first time in 30 years, will involve neither Joaqun Balaguer nor
Juan Bosch, the two octogenarians who have dominated the country's
politics. Mr Bosch has retired because of poor health, while Mr
Balaguer cannot stand for a seventh term because changes in the
constitution prevent consecutive terms.

17th The trial of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols for the Oklahoma
City bombing of 1995 is due to open.

17th to August 25th. The Glyndebourne Festival Opera in southern
England. The pick of the 1996 festival will be Handel's 'Theodora' and
Berg's 'Lulu'.

21st - 22nd Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development
annual meeting of finance, foreign and trade ministers.

22nd Degas: Beyond Impressionism exhibition. Degas achieved fame with
his work of the 1870s and 1880s, above all with pictures of the ballet
and the racecourse, but his experimental later work has never been
properly studied, and this will be the first big show devoted to it. It
runs at the National Gallery, London, until August 26, and moves to the
Art Institute of Chicago in September.

22nd World Health Organisation publishes the World Health Report, which
is expected to highlight the danger of bacterial resistance to drugs.
Such infections as tuberculosis and gonorrhea have become resistant to
drugs and have outpaced the development of antibiotics to control them.

22nd - 24th The African Development Bank annual meeting in Abidjan.

31st The World Health Organisation marks World No-Tobacco Day.

31st - June 1st The Czech Republic's first general election since its
'velvet divorce' from Slovakia in 1992. The centre-right Prime Minister
Vaclav Klaus leads the polls.

JUNE

5th Opec general conference in Vienna.

Vietnam's eighth Communist party congress is due to take place in Hanoi
this month.

8th - 30th European Championship soccer. Can the persistently mediocre
England team use home advantage to win its first important trophy in 30
years? The game against the Netherlands should be testing, and the one
against Scotland colourful. The match with the least tourist potential
is Bulgaria versus Romania in Newcastle. The Germans, the Italians and
the Dutch are the best bets to win the championship, and the Turks are
the worst.

10th Annual meeting of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS),
attended by central bankers from around the world.

The Italian general elections, expected this February, May, June or
sometime later. It is a mystery when Italy's political parties will
agree to hold the early polls. If the elections are not held in the
first half of 1996, the life of parliament will probably be prolonged
until the spring of 1997.

16th Scheduled date for the Russian presidential elections, and the
year's most likely source of political shock. The Russian constitution
vests vast powers in the presidency, and some analysts fear that a
Communist candidate, or, even worse, an ultra-nationalist, may win.
However, businessmen and politicians close to Russian President Boris
Yeltsin are already urging him to postpone the poll. Will Yeltsin be
fit to fight?

21st - 30th Gays and lesbians hold the Europride conference in
Copenhagen.

22nd - 23rd EU summit of heads of state and government in Florence.

24th The Wimbledon tennis tournament starts, and the search for British
heroes (anyone who reaches the second round) is on.

27th - 29th Heads of government and finance ministers from the Group of
Seven leading industrial countries gather in Lyons for their annual
economic summit. In recent years the G7 has tried to scale back the
pomp and ceremony which accompanies these jamborees, but it is not yet
clear that President Jacques Chirac, the host, will be able to resist
arranging something spectacular. France, which is chairing the G7 in
1996, wants the meeting to concentrate on development, while the
leaders are also expected to use the meeting to accelerate reform of
United Nations institutions.

30th Hong Kong enters its last year under British rule.

JULY

1st Ireland takes over the EU presidency.

7th - 12th Eleventh International Conference on Aids in Vancouver.

19th The Proms. The world's biggest music festival enters its second
century under new director Nicholas Kenyon. At London's Royal Albert
Hall until September 14.

19th The centenary edition of the modern Olympics meets a steamy
southern summer in Atlanta, Georgia, which perhaps explains why the
most sought-after seats have been for the swimming and diving
competititions. Going on the off-chance is not advised since just about
all tickets are long gone by lottery or to sponsors. A total of 26
sports will be on display, with only women's softball as a newcomer
(don't sniff, the fastballs come in at 90mph). Some refinements
elsewhere: for instance, mountain bikes have been added to the cycling
classification. The Games end on August 4.

20th The Salzburg Festival, until August 31. Of the three new opera
productions, the most intriguing is Beethoven's 'Fidelio', which pairs
octogenarian conductor Georg Solti with radical German
producer-designer Herbert Wernicke. The other show to catch is the
Pierre Boulez-Peter Stein production of Schoenberg's 'Moses und Aron'.

Some time this summer Stanley Kubrick, one of Hollywood's most
influential but least productive film makers, starts shooting Eyes Wide
Shut starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in London. Kubrick, a
legendary figure in the film world, has written, directed and produced
a string of successes from 2001: A Space Odyssey to Dr Strangelove. He
is a notorious perfectionist - the actor Jack Nicholson said he 'gives
new meaning to the word meticulous' - and has not made a film since
Full Metal Jacket in 1987.

31st Japan-US semiconductor accord to expire.

AUGUST

11th - 31st The 50th Edinburgh International Festival. Productions by
Robert Wilson, Robert Lepage and Peter Stein, orchestras from
Cleveland, Moscow, New York and Oslo, plus Houston Grand Opera.

12th Liberian presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled.

12th - 15th US Republican party national convention in San Diego,
California, followed from August 27 to 29 by the Democratic party
national convention in Chicago, Illinois. Both are later than usual
because of the Olympics. The main order of business for both is to
crown candidates for president and vice president, with the latter
usually providing what suspense there is. But conventions, by also
endorsing party platforms, can set a tone for the autumn campaign for
the White House. The harsh rightwing notes sounded by the Republicans
in Houston in 1992 got George Bush off on the wrong foot, while the
left's anti-war riots in Chicago in 1968 gave Hubert Humphrey a
handicap he never overcame. Party managers try to script convention
business to the last minute, ensuring that candidates get maximum
exposure, but perfect discipline is often hard to impose on committed
delegates.

16th Indonesia's President Suharto delivers the annual State of the
Nation address, marking his country's Independence Day on August 17. He
is not a man for saying a lot in public, so few of his citizens will
watch anything else on television today. This year's speech will be
more interesting than most, because Mr Suharto will outline how he
thinks the country should behave as it prepares for the five - yearly
elections which begin in 1997. Deciphering a speech from the man who
has run the country for 28 years usually requires the delphic qualities
of a Javanese dukun. But identifying who he thinks should win the
elections shouldn't be difficult.

19th Bill Clinton turns 50. If he loses the White House in November, he
faces the prospect of a great many rounds of golf.

25th - 26th London celebrates the 31st Notting Hill Carnival. On the
second day, Britain takes a summer Bank Holiday.

SEPTEMBER

1st The second anniversary of the IRA ceasefire, if peace holds in
Northern Ireland.

9th The 20th anniversary of Mao's death will be cause for cautious
recognition by the Chinese Communist party, which has a deep fear that
anniversaries will be turned into occasions for popular protest. Even
the party faithful have mixed views about Mao - he is officially
reckoned to have been '70 per cent right, 30 per cent wrong' in his
role as the Great Helmsman.

9th - 13th Britain's Trades Union Congress holds its annual conference
in Blackpool.

14th Jewish New Year 5757 starts.

17th United Nations General Assembly opens in New York.

19th Fiftieth anniversary of Winston Churchill's call for a 'United
States of Europe'.

20th - 22nd The Pope visits France.

30th Crunch time arrives for Spain's prospects for joining the European
single currency. This is the deadline for submitting the crucial 1997
budget. The Euro was launched in Madrid, but Spain won't be a founding
member unless the government - possibly a new conservative
administration - manages to slash the public sector deficit. Not that
Spain is the only EU member facing this particular problem.

30th The British Labour's party conference runs in Blackpool until
October 4. If Labour can avoid turbulence, it will surely romp home in
1997 - or possibly earlier. This means that the party's detailed tax
plans are expected to be kept in reserve until the last minute, while
the conference will only be asked to rubber stamp the final elements of
Labour's policy review, including a long-awaited statement on social
security reforms. Tony Blair should already be profiting from two
by-election victories early in the New Year, and will attempt to
exploit the government's vanishing majority on key issues such as
Europe.

OCTOBER

1st - 3rd The annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington.

8th - 11th The British Tory party conference in Bournemouth. Possibly
John Major's last as prime minister, so pretenders will bid for the
succession.

15th-29th: British International Motor Show at the National Exhibition
Centre near Birmingham. The days of bikini - clad models draped across
shiny bonnets at motor fairs have generally given way to sober
salesmanship. This show opens to the public from October 18.

16th Organisers of 1995's Million Man March are planning a Million
Family March in Washington for today.

29th Last possible date for Israeli elections to be held.

29th The winner of the Booker Prize, Britain's most prestigious
literary award, is named in London. Expect critical face-gouging. Last
year, super-heavyweight Salman Rushdie (4-5 favourite for The Moor's
Last Sigh) was stylishly outpointed by fast-punching middleweight Pat
Barker (5-1; The Ghost Road). Things can only get bloodier.

30th Helmut Kohl will have been German chancellor for 5,144 days, as
long as Konrad Adenauer, who took the job in 1949 aged 73. Having
outrun his idol, Mr Kohl must hang on until 2001 to become the longest
serving chancellor ever, upstaging Bismarck, who held office for 6,940
days from 1871 to 1890. Will he make it? Mr Kohl says he expects to
quit in 1998. But Der Spiegel, the news magazine Mr Kohl refuses to
read, already calls him 'Bismarck in a cardigan'.

NOVEMBER

5th US election day - for president and vice president, all 435 seats
in the House of Representatives and 33 in the Senate, plus a full card
of state and local races. This could be a pivotal election if
Republicans win the White House and hold on to majorities in Congress.
Bill Clinton is still favourite for a second term, but not by much.
With eight of 15 incumbent Democrats not seeking re-election,
Republicans hope to increase their current 53 seats in Senate to a
filibuster-proof 60. The House, now with 236 Republicans, is often more
volatile. Voter turn-out may approach 60 per cent only if the field is
fleshed out by interesting independent or third party candidates (Ross
Perot helped lift it to 55 per cent in 1992).

10th - 12th The Confederation of British Industry annual conference in
Harrogate.

11th Germans begin their annual goose-eating binge. Germany may be a
highly developed industrial nation, but it still fusses over customs
and likes to observe saints' days, possibly because these have
developed a commercial momentum. The feast day in this case is St
Martin's, and the carnival starts in the Rhineland at 11.11am.

13th - 17th The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation's World Food
Summit in Rome. Heads of state and government meet from November 16 to
17.

26th Kenneth Clarke, the British chancellor, will deliver his fourth
Budget or Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, will deliver his first.
If Mr Clarke is still at Number 11, the 1996 Budget should be much like
1995's: modest tax cuts paid for with modest cuts in public spending
plans. If Mr Brown has moved in, the content is less clear. Not only
has Labour avoided revealing much about its tax plans, but Mr Brown may
discover that Mr Clarke has left him little room for manoeuvre.
Incoming governments traditionally say they have had to scale back
their plans because 'the books have been left in much worse shape than
we expected'.

The Bibliotheque Nationale de France, dubbed the 'tres grande
bibliotheque', is scheduled to open to the public in Paris late this
month. Approved by former President Francois Mitterrand in 1988, and
built at a cost of FFr8bn, four angled tower blocks symbolise open
books, surrounding a suspended garden. The public will have access to
400,000 books.

DECEMBER

6th-7th EU summit in Dublin. The Netherlands takes over the presidency
at the start of 1997.

9th - 13th Singapore hosts the first World Trade Organisation
ministerial meeting.

10th The Nobel peace prize is awarded in Oslo.

On a date in December yet to be fixed, the US Electoral College meets
to certify the results of the November election. The winner in the
national popular vote can still lose the election if his opponent
carries states with a majority in the Electoral College. These are
apportioned, winner-take-all, according to state population, ranging
from California's 54 delegates to three each for various smaller
states.

The world's tallest office buildings are due to be completed in the
centre of Kuala Lumpur in 1996, and to be dedicated this month. At 450
metres, the twin Petronas Towers will be slightly taller than Chicago's
Sears building. The project forms part of the plan of Dr Mahathir
Mohamad, the prime minister, to turn Malaysia into a fully
industrialised country by 2020. Opponents accuse him of indulging in
grandiose schemes of questionable economic benefit. Furthermore, they
add, the towers will soon be overtaken by other Far Eastern rivals.

Russian economists and western agencies have predicted that 1996 will
be the first year that Russia's nascent market economy experiences
positive growth. The Organisation for Economic Co - operation and
Development, for instance, forecasts a growth rate of 2 per cent. An
economic upswing could boost the flagging political fortunes of Russian
reformers; on the other hand, political instability could still
undermine the country's economic prospects.

Some time towards the end of 1996, or otherwise early in 1997, 10m
savers and borrowers with Britain's Halifax Building Society will get
free Halifax shares when the society floats.

FIAT STEPS UP DRIVE FOR IMPORT POSITION

   By JOHN GRIFFITHS

Fiat Auto UK is restructuring its dealer networks as part of a campaign
to regain its status as one of the UK new car market's biggest
importers.

The company is reorganising its 220-strong Fiat dealer network and
increasing its Alfa-Romeo dealerships by 25 per cent.

The moves strengthening the dealer networks come as the Italian group's
wholly-owned UK subsidiary prepares today to launch its Bravo and Brava
models. They are intended to challenge Ford's Escort, Vauxhall's Astra
and other similar-sized models in one of the biggest sectors of the UK
new car market. Fiat spent more than Pounds 1bn developing the new
models.

The models appear set to return the Fiat brand to the 4 per cent-plus
market share levels not seen since the early 1980s. Mr James Blades,
Fiat Auto UK's managing director, now expects final figures to show
that Fiat's market share in 1995 reached 3.6 per cent, with total sales
approaching 75,000 including about 3,000 Alfa-Romeo sales.

Fiat's UK market share peaked in 1979 at 4.9 per cent, with sales of
Lancia models at the time lifting the group's share above 5 per cent.
Yet for much of the 1980s, its share slid downwards - mainly because
of the parent group's failure to invest in new models. By 1992 it had
slumped to less than 2 per cent.

So poor were Lancia sales that Fiat has stopped importing them to the
UK altogether, while sales of Alfa-Romeo - bought by Fiat in 1987 -
currently represent less than 0.2 per cent of the UK market.

However, the launch of two small cars, the Punto and Cinquecento, has
already brought about a strong revival. Mr Blades said: 'We are now
working hard to ensure that further growth is stable and sustainable.
That means making further inroads to fleets so as not to be subject to
the whims of private buyers.'

Fiat's concern in this respect is illustrated by Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders statistics showing that the total new car
market in the UK grew 2 per cent in the first 11 months of 1995. Within
this total, fleet demand grew 7 per cent whereas sales to private
buyers have stagnated.

The importance of the fleet sector to manufacturers and importers is
underlined by the fact that around 47 per cent of new cars in 1996 are
expected to be bought by fleets.

Fiat's sales to fleets in 1995 played a big part in its outperformance
of the new car market overall. At 67,400, Fiat's total sales in the
first 11 months were 20 per cent higher than in the same period in
1994, compared with only a 2 per cent rise in the UK new car market
overall. Within the total, however, sales to fleets have jumped 43 per
cent. The importance of Bravo/Brava to Fiat's further UK growth is
underlined by the fact that the model segment in which they will
compete accounts for more than 30 per cent of the fleet market.

Under the dealer restructuring, Fiat is retaining the overall size of
the network at about 220 dealers but replacing many of the smaller,
less committed outlets with facilities owned by the bigger retailing
groups.

As a result of the shake-up, now in its final stages, some 30 per cent
of the network is owned by members of the UK's top 100 retailing groups
which are capable of making the substantial investment that Fiat wants
to see.

POOREST DEPEND ON BENEFITS 'FOR 70% OF INCOME'

   By GRAHAM BOWLEY

The poorest 20 per cent of households get almost three-quarters of
their income from state benefits, government statisticians have found.

Cash benefits made up 70 per cent of the gross income of the bottom
fifth of Britain's households in the past financial year (1994-95),
according to the Central Statistical Office's latest survey of economic
trends.

Taxes and government benefits trebled the share of total income of the
poorest 20 per cent of households, the study shows.

Their share of total UK income grew from 2.3 per cent before taxes and
benefits to 6.9 per cent after taxes and benefits.

Before tax, the top fifth of households earned 20 times more than the
lowest fifth but only four times as much after taxes and benefits.

The top 20 per cent of households paid 19.6 per cent of their gross
income in income tax compared with 11 per cent paid by other
households.

State pensions accounted for almost three-quarters of the cash benefits
received by retired households, the study finds.

The distribution of income before tax is more equal among those still
at work than those who have retired.

But the distribution of after-tax income is more equal among retired
than among working households.

The CSO gives, for the first time, a regional breakdown of gross
domestic product and investment. This shows that in 1994 - the latest
year for which complete figures are available - the south-east, home
to 31 per cent of the population, accounted for about 36 per cent of
GDP.

The north-west, which was the second most productive region, produced
9.9 per cent of the UK's total GDP.

Northern Ireland accounted for the lowest proportion of GDP at 2.3 per
cent.

The south-east also had the highest GDP per capita at Pounds 11,407 per
head - compared with the UK average of Pounds 9,768.

The lowest was Northern Ireland where it was Pounds 8,027 per head and
Wales where the figure was Pounds 8,274.

But this gap is narrowing. Growth in GDP per head has been higher in
Northern Ireland than any other region since 1990.

Income from employment was the source of more than 65 per cent of GDP
in Scotland, whereas it accounted for less than 61 per cent in East
Anglia and the south-west.

TORIES WARN OVER NICHOLSON ATTACKS

   By JAMES BLITZ, Lobby Correspondent

Senior left-of-centre Con-servatives yesterday warned the government to
tone down its attacks on Miss Emma Nicholson, the MP for Devon West and
Torridge, following her defection to the Liberal Democrats last week.

As her decision to quit the Conservatives continued to inflame the
long-running battle between leftwing and rightwing Tories, Mr Peter
Temple-Morris, the MP for Leominster, condemned the 'torrent of
personal abuse' being heaped on Miss Nicholson. He argued that the
criticisms were not helping to settle pro-European Tory MPs in the wake
of her defection.

In recent days Mr Michael Heseltine, the deputy prime minister, has
claimed that Miss Nicholson's departure followed her repeated and
unsuccessful attempts to gain a ministerial post in the government.

Mr Michael Portillo, the defence secretary, compounded the criticism
yesterday by arguing that Miss Nicholson had 'demonstrated a history of
disloyalty' - in part by deciding to vote against Baroness Thatcher in
the 1990 Conservative leadership contest.

However, Mr Temple-Morris, a Euro-enthusiast who, ironically, is often
associated with Mr Heseltine's cause, warned that the attacks on Miss
Nicholson were further damaging party morale.

'If someone does defect from the party, then that is bad enough without
personalising things,' he said. 'But ministers are creating a situation
in which the public probably has some sympathy with her.'

Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, attacked the language with
which Mr Portillo had castigated Miss Nicholson, insisting that
ministers needed to understand why she had made such a move.

'This is what I regret, that members of the cabinet should be indulging
in this sort of language and this approach,' he told BBC Radio 4's
Today programme. 'We should be making sure that other people who have
anxieties should have those anxieties removed so the public should see
we are not a bitterly divided party, that we have pulled ourselves
together and can work together.'

Ministers were yesterday hoping that the circumstances of Miss
Nicholson's move were exceptional and would not be followed by further
defections.

But party whips will be heeding the recent claim by Mr Hugh Dykes, the
MP for Harrow East, that a further six Tories could defect to
opposition parties before the next general election. Mr Dykes, one of
the most staunchly pro-European of Conservatives, will have his every
move watched closely by Tory whips in the next few months.

Others whose names have been speculated upon as possible defectors are
Mr Temple-Morris; Mr Robert Hicks, MP for Cornwall South East; Sir
Keith Speed, MP for Ashford; Mr George Walden, MP for Buckingham; and
Mr Tim Rathbone, MP for Lewes.

None of these has been prepared to admit that he is seeking to move to
another party. However, two of them - Mr Hicks and Mr Walden - have
indicated dissatisfaction with the direction of politics at Westminster
by announcing that they will not be standing at the next general
election. Sir Keith Speed is also standing down at the next election.

SALES SUCCESS LESS SWEET AS CHEWERS AVOID SUGAR

   By JOHN AUTHERS

Consumers tried to cut down on their sugar in 1995, according to the
annual survey for the chocolate and sweets markets carried out by
Cadbury Schweppes, the confectionery company.

While Nestle's Kit Kat bar consolidated its lead over the Mars Bar -
perceived as more fattening - in the chocolate market, the most
popular sweet was Wrigley's Extra, a sugar-free chewing gum.

Total consumption of chocolate declined slightly compared with 1994,
from 530,000 tonnes to 526,000 tonnes, a trend which manufacturers
attributed to the hot weather during the summer. But total spending on
chocolate reached a new high of Pounds 3.2bn.

Kit Kat sales rose 4 per cent to Pounds 200m while those of Mars Bars
fell 2 per cent to Pounds 150m.

A report in June by Datamonitor, the market research company, said Kit
Kat's share of the chocolate snack market had stayed at about 17.4 per
cent between 1990 and 1994, while the Mars Bar's share had dropped from
16 per cent to 11.7 per cent.

Mars made changes to its product in 1995 in an attempt to appeal to
women and to make its bars seem less fattening, introducing bite-sized
versions and changing the recipe to make it taste lighter.

Cadbury's Dairy Milk consolidated its place as the third most popular
chocolate.

In the market for sweets, Wrigley's Extra gum finished ahead of Polo
mints and Rowntree's Fruit Pastilles, according to the annual review by
Trebor Bassett, the sugar confectionery division of Cadbury's. Orbit by
Wrigley, another sugar-free gum, came fourth, well ahead of the better
known Wrigley's Spearmint, which was 17th.

The total size of the market was less than half that for chocolate,
with total sales of Pounds 1.4bn and 283,000 tonnes sold. Average
spending per capita for the year was Pounds 24.

The hot summer weather also affected sales of sweets, which include
cough lozenges in the top 20, according to Trebor Bassett. But it
added: 'There remains enormous future potential for market growth - we
still have quite a way to go before we match the per capita consumption

ECONOMIC GROWTH PROSPECTS SUFFER DOUBLE BLOW

   By GRAHAM BOWLEY, Economics Staff

A gloomier outlook for the UK economy emerged today with a leading
forecaster predicting that growth will slow in 1996 and with the
publication of a poll which shows that business confidence is at its
lowest since 1992.

The latest report by Cambridge Econometrics, the economic consultancy,
says a slowdown in the rest of the world will depress Britain's exports
this year. It says companies will also cut output as they try to sell
the stocks they built up in 1995.

As a result, UK gross domestic product will grow by less than 2.5 per
cent in 1996 compared with 2.75 per cent last year. This prediction
clashes with the official Treasury forecast of 3 per cent growth in
1996.

But growth will rebound in 1997 to 2.8 per cent, the forecasting group
says. It thinks that spending by consumers will grow modestly in 1996
and then expand strongly next year - partly because of expected tax
cuts in the next Budget.

Meanwhile, a survey of 2,000 businesses published today by Lloyds Bank
shows that confidence is at its lowest level since the poll began in
1992. For the first time, the survey shows an increase in those
businesses reporting cashflow problems and a slowdown in export
orders.

Orders for goods and services continue to grow - but at the slowest
rate since the second half of 1992. The poll shows that confidence has
dropped because economic growth has been disappointingly slow.

Mr Michael Riding, the director of commercial banking at Lloyds Bank,
said that although companies 'are still experiencing growth, they are
having difficulty in coming to terms with managing in a low inflation
economy. This, coupled with failed growth expectations, has made them
somewhat pessimistic - possibly unnecessarily'.

Companies in the construction and retail sectors reported the slowest
growth in orders, while manufacturing companies and hotels and catering
businesses reported strong growth. Companies told Lloyds Bank that
investment spending has slowed because of slower profit growth and
increased pressure on cashflow. However, Cambridge Econometrics
predicts that investment will pick up in 1996 as the private finance
initiative fills much of the gap left by cuts in government capital
spending.

The forecasting group says there is evidence of a build-up in stocks in
the motor vehicle, chemical and non-metallic mineral product
industries. It predicts that headline inflation will fall in the short
term in response to lower mortgage interest rates, although the
underlying rate will remain broadly unchanged.

In the longer term, headline inflation will rise to 3.7 per cent in
1997 from 3.1 per cent at present.

WALDEGRAVE RESOLVES TO START EARLY: NEW YEAR AIMS INCLUDE PUSHING THE
PFI AND TACKLING FRAUD

   By ROBERT CHOTE

Like the arrival of Christmas in the shops, negotiations between the
Treasury and government departments over public spending seem to get
earlier every year.

The detail of the last public spending round was published only a month
ago, at the time of the Budget. But Mr William Waldegrave, the chief
secretary to the Treasury, is already preparing for the opening
skirmishes of this year's battle.

Mr Waldegrave said in an interview with the Financial Times that he
planned to emulate his predecessor, Mr Jonathan Aitken, by looking at
the spending of larger departments in spring, before the haggling
proper gets under way.

The Department of Social Security will come under particular scrutiny,
according to Mr Waldegrave. Its Pounds 90bn budget next year will be
Whitehall's largest by far, so it is bound to be an important target in
any search for savings.

'It is essential that they are feeling the full force of the
possibilities of new ways of doing things,' Mr Waldegrave said. 'Peter
Lilley has exciting things to say about how benefits can be delivered
in a few years' time. What the Treasury has to see is whether 'a few
years' time' can be made any shorter.'

Mr Waldegrave has been criticised by some MPs for allowing too big an
increase in the DSS's running costs during the last spending round. But
he argues that some cuts have actually cost money by weakening control
of the benefit system.

Mr Waldegrave said it was clear that the proportion of social security
claimed fraudulently - estimated at between 5 per cent and 10 per cent
for some benefits - was much larger than most observers had thought.

He noted that a pilot scheme to issue some claimants in London with
swipecards was already saving money. 'One of the things I have to do
early in the new year is see what is a practicable, do-able,
non-fantastic programme here which might generate another few hundred
million,' he said.

Mr Waldegrave said there was also scope to push the private finance
initiative, which attracts private sector funds and expertise into
public sector infrastructure projects.

'One thing we have broken the back of this year is institutional
resistance to the PFI, although it only generates a saving for public
expenditure in terms of delivering better value for money,' he said.

Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, believes that
economic activity may be slowed in the short term by an 'infrastructure
hiatus' as private finance replaces direct public funding. But Mr
Waldegrave said he expected private money to be attracted more quickly
than the Treasury assumed in the Budget.

There were no 'wonder drugs' which would deliver savings from
government spending next year, Mr Waldegrave added. He ruled out the
idea of taking a tougher line with the Department of National Heritage
because of the extra revenue from the National Lottery.

But Mr Waldegrave admitted he was attracted - although this was a
personal rather than a Treasury view - to the idea that arts
organisations could be funded through endowments. This would limit the
centralisation of public support for the arts, although it would not
necessarily save money.

Mr Waldegrave said that in framing a long-term strategy for public
spending, it was unrealistic to aim for the low government shares of
national income achieved in some Asia-Pacific countries.

Nations such as the US, New Zealand and Switzerland were better role
models, implying a government share of national income of 35 per cent
or 36 per cent. Public spending stands at 42 per cent of national
income, compared with the formal target of less than 40 per cent.

Mr Waldegrave said every chief secretary had the ambition of reaching a
stage where it was no longer necessary to hold public spending
negotiations every year. He said it was worth investigating the idea
that departments could agree a tough settlement on the understanding
that their budgets were guaranteed for a number of years. But he
conceded that departments would fear that a future chief secretary
would not feel bound by the pledge.

So the annual ritual of the public spending negotiations remains with
us. Every year departments will squeal about the pressure they are
under, and the chief secretary will proclaim one of the toughest rounds
in living memory.

POLICY FOR TERRORISM INSURANCE UNDER ATTACK: AS THE IRA CEASEFIRE HAS
LITTLE EFFECT ON PREMIUMS, BUSINESSES QUESTION THE ROLE OF REINSURER
POOL RE

   By RALPH ATKINS

When the IRA bombed the City of London in 1992 and 1993, causing more
than Pounds 1bn in damage, businesses were thankful that anyone was
prepared to provide insurance against further attacks.

With insurers set to exclude unlimited terrorism cover from commercial
policies, the setting up of Pool Re - a state-backed 'reinsurance'
company which would underwrite policies sold by conventional insurers
- was seen as a sensible response.

Nearly three years later, as many companies renegotiate policies due
for renewal, the mood has changed.

Pool Re is criticised as expensive and inflexible. The Association of
Insurance and Risk Managers, which represents commercial insurance
buyers, reckons the high rates Pool Re charges are forcing companies to
choose between spending large amounts on terrorism cover - or risk
going without.

The IRA ceasefire has had a limited impact. Premium rates have fallen:
a 20 per cent discount has been announced for next year. Pool Re also
collects only 60 per cent of the policy premium at the start of the
year; the remaining 40 per cent is waived if total claims during the
year do not exceed a certain level (Pounds 75m in 1996).

But terrorism cover used to be included in standard commercial property
policies at no additional cost. As Mr Leslie Lucas, Pool Re chief
executive, admits: 'Any policyholder is going to say that, if we once
had it offered for nothing, any price is going to be too much.'

There is also concern that the structure of Pool Re is preventing the
development of an alternative terrorism insurance market.

When Pool Re started in 1993 it had no capital and operated as a
mutual, pooling the resources of those who depended on its services. It
insists member insurance companies only sell terrorism cover at rates
and on terms set by Pool Re. Premiums are pooled into an insurance fund
which at the end of 1994 stood at Pounds 410m but is likely now to be
substantially higher. Because most insurers are Pool Re members,
companies have little option but to buy Pool Re policies.

Moreover, corporate groups cannot 'cherry pick' - buying insurance
policies backed by Pool Re only for vulnerable properties. Apart from
smaller sites, they have to buy cover for all or none.

Rates are set according to formula varying by location. There is only
limited scope for taking account of measures individual companies might
take to reduce their exposure to terrorist attack.

Mr Alan Gavaghan, the deputy chairman of insurance broker Willis
Corroon, says: 'A lot of companies spend a lot of money on risk
prevention action, not just things like sprinklers and shatter-proof
windows. They have put a lot of thought into it, but they are treated
in the same way as people with clapped-out warehouses.'

Alternatives are available. Willis Corroon is one of five brokers which
combined to provide terrorism insurance underwritten by syndicates at
Lloyd's of London which are not Pool Re members.

Last month the facility was improved and policies paying out up to
Pounds 100m per terrorist attack are available. That means large
companies could choose to insure just their most vulnerable properties.

But the total amount of insurance coverage available is limited. Prices
may also not be sufficiently attractive for companies to switch from
Pool Re policies which provide unlimited cover. As Mr Jeremy Lowe, of
Willis Corroon, says: 'It is a viable alternative to Pool Re for those
who want to be selective, rather than a competitor.'

In spite of its criticism, the Association of Insurance and Risk
Managers do not want to kill the idea of a pool.

'The concept is a good one,' says Ms Ina Barker, executive director.
'The premiums of the many pay for the claims of the few.' There is also
little sign that insurers and reinsurers are willing to return to
providing full terrorism cover without state back-up.

The association's idea is that Pool Re should be funded by a flat
contribution, or levy, on all commercial property policies. That should
allow a return to the automatic provision of terrorism cover. As funds
are built up by Pool Re - assuming there is no escalation of terrorism
 - there would be scope for contributions holidays.

Potentially, Pool Re could evolve into a state-backed reinsurer
providing cover against other perils where the incidence is low but
potential costs could be catastrophic - London flooding is a possible
example.

The aim would be to achieve the basic principle of insurance -
spreading big risks on the shoulders of many. Ms Barker says:
'Terrorism insurance ought to be automatic for the benefit of society.'

BIG THAW LEADS TO WATER CUTS

   By PRESS ASSOCIATION

Thousands of homes throughout the UK were flooded and whole communities
faced water shortages yesterday as the Christmas freeze gave way to a
dramatic thaw, bursting water mains and domestic water systems. In some
areas, temperatures soared from - 20'C to around 7'C.

In Scotland, 500,000 Strathclyde homes suffered burst pipes at some
point over the holiday. Water rationing was introduced in parts of
Northern Ireland as reservoirs ran low because of water leaks and burst
pipes. More than 100,000 homes were affected and water tankers were
being used in some areas.

The Northern Ireland Housing Executive, which is responsible for public
housing, dealt with more than 5,000 calls. Plumbers ran short of
materials and the executive had to arrange special openings of supply
stores to allow work to continue. Vast quantities of water were lost
because affected schools, factories and offices were closed for the
holidays.

Thousands of consumers in the Carmarthen area of west Wales spent
yesterday without water because of a burst main taking supplies from
the river Towy. In England North West Water brought in extra staff to
cope with phone calls, and other areas affected by the thaw included
Northumberland, Tyneside and Wearside, East Anglia, Essex, and Suffolk.
Thames Water said customers were cut off at various times but teams
were working to restore services.

NEW YEAR PLAN CONDEMNED: SCOTTISH BANK HOLIDAYS

   By PRESS ASSOCIATION

Scottish nationalists yesterday attacked plans to bring Scottish
banking industry holidays into line with England. The move could make
this the last traditional new year holiday period north of the border
and set a precedent for other employers, warned Ms Anne McNair, the
Scottish National party's employment spokeswoman.

Scotland has two new year bank holidays - January 1 and January 2 -
whereas England and Wales have only January 1.

Announcing SNP backing for a campaign by the main banking union Bifu,
she said: 'Once again it seems that Scottish families and society are
taking second place to English clearing banks and the London Stock
Exchange. Making Easter Monday a bank holiday instead of January 2, as
is proposed, would make no sense since demand for banking services is
far greater at Easter than at new year.'

PLEA FOR HELP OVER FRAUD PROBE: NHS TRUSTS

   By JOHN AUTHERS

The National Health Service Executive has written to all 458 NHS trusts
asking them to co-operate with a police investigation into an alleged
fraud by locum agencies. The investigation follows routine checks last
year by the Audit Commission, the NHS watchdog, at four hospitals in
north Wales.

The Metropolitan Police's company fraud unit is now investigating the
claims. It believes that up to 80 trusts could have fallen victim to
the alleged fraud, which is said to have involved charging excessive
fees or sending duplicate invoices for the services of locum doctors
and therapists. Four people have been arrested in connection with the
allegations, and released on police bail. The total sum involved is
alleged to be about Pounds 3m.

SAINSBURY CUTS 200 PRICES: FOOD RETAILING

   By PRESS ASSOCIATION

J. Sainsbury fired a new year salvo in the supermarket price war
yesterday by cutting the cost of more than 200 items by up to 50 per
cent during January. The move comes three days after frozen food
chainstore Iceland announced it was reducing some prices to those of
1986. However, Sainsbury and other leading food retailers denied that
the initiatives would trigger another round in the price war.

FISHING PATROL MOVES INTO DISPUTED AREA

   By BERNARD GRAY

HMS Lindisfarne, a UK Fisheries Protection Vessel, yesterday went on
patrol in the controversial Irish Box fishing area between western
England and Ireland to mark the first day that Spanish trawlers were
legally entitled to work in the disputed zone.

Also on standby to monitor the situation were three commercially
chartered patrol aircraft which are used to oversee fishing fleets in
British waters.

However, in spite of predictions of confrontation, none of the 20
Spanish boats which have so far registered to work in the Irish Box
appeared.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food pointed to the holiday
season as a possible explanation and added that fishing conditions were
not particularly favourable in the area at present.

Meanwhile, arguments continued between British politicians about the
agreement, which allows the large Spanish trawler fleet to use the
area, traditionally the preserve of Cornish fishing fleets.

Mr David Harris, a Conservative MP whose constituency includes the
Newlyn fishing port, said yesterday that Spanish access to the Irish
Box would inevitably lead to further cuts in quotas, hurting the UK
fishing industry.

Mr Harris said he had written to Mr John Major, the prime minister,
arguing that more control of fishing zones should be handed back to
individual European Union member states, rather than being regulated by
the European Commission through quotas.

'The end result is going to be massive over-fishing of stocks already
under pressure,' he said.

Yet Mr Tony Baldry, the fishing minister, said that Spanish boats would
not be able to catch any additional fish by choosing to trawl in the
Irish Box, rather than in other areas.

'They will be policed equally fiercely on the catches that they take to
make sure the fish are the proper size and are within quota, as much as
ensuring that there are no more than 40 trawlers at any one time in the
Irish Box,' he said.

The two politicians also disagreed about whether Spanish boats would
abide by the rules of the agreement to use the disputed waters.

Mr Harris predicted that Spanish trawlers would use 'every trick in the
book' to skirt the rules, while Mr Baldry argued that the Spanish boats
would comply.

'It will be a very stupid Spanish skipper who seeks to break the
rules,' said Mr Baldry. 'If he does so he will be brought into court,
he will be prosecuted and he will be fined up to Pounds 50,000.'

THIS WEEK:
NERVES BEGIN TO FRAY OVER BUDGET IMPASSE - DATELINE / WASHINGTON, ANGER
THE THE 'CLOWNS OF CONGRESS' IS RISING

   By JUREK MARTIN

It is probable that the US government will still not be fully
functioning again this morning - and it is not possible to ignore the
rising tide of public and personal disgust with the wilfulness of those
on the right wing of the US Congress who have brought about this pretty
pass.

Note, from the outset, where the finger of blame is pointed: not at
President Bill Clinton, though he may have contributed to the overall
budget impasse and is reaping political benefit from it; nor at Senator
Bob Dole, though the majority leader might have been more resolute in
standing up to his party's vizigoths if he did not need them for his
presidential ambitions.

No, responsibility lies squarely with those so convinced of their own
rectitude and so insulated from the real world outside their
conservative salons and support groups that they cannot understand the
damage they are doing - not only to those affected by the longest, if
partial, closure of the federal government ever, but also, ultimately,
to their own cause of balancing the budget in seven years.

It is doubtful that the impact of the suspension of government business
will lop more than a fraction of 1 per cent off GNP. Important
industries and cities have not ground to a halt because 280,000 federal
bureaucrats have been laid off. No college football game, the opiate of
the New Year season, has been cancelled.

There has been damage, however: to the civil servants, not exactly fat
cats, unpaid for two weeks over Christmas; to small federal contractors
dependent on government; to the 20,000 people who apply for passports
every day and the 23,000 who register with social security; and to the
small towns and businesses that live off the seasonal trade of great
national parks like Yosemite in California, where the adjacent Mariposa
County has declared itself a disaster area.

They may not amount to a collective blip in the national statistics,
but their livelihoods are affected - for months ahead - and all are
some politician's constituents. To judge by their comments in streams
of US media interviews, they are mostly mad with what they frequently
call 'the clowns of Congress', and soon some poll will doubtless
measure their anger.

Perhaps more serious for the congressional right is the offence they
have given to the chattering classes, who, when aroused, can still do
much to shape public opinion. Nothing has offended them more than the
denial of unfettered access to the most comprehensive collection ever
assembled in one place of the works of Johannes Vermeer, the Dutch
master, at the National Gallery here in Washington.

Last week, Rusty Powell, the gallery's director, was able to open its
doors by releasing Dollars 30,000 from a private donor fund earmarked
for future exhibitions. This was enough to make the Vermeers - but not
the rest of the formidable standing collection, nor the concurrent
Winslow Homer exhibition - available to the public. And did they come,
with lines in frigid weather stretching round the block for precious
passes.

But the money is only good for a week, which means that unless Congress
comes up with funding for the gallery pronto, the Vermeer exhibition
cannot complete its scheduled run until next month. And, like the small
businessmen in Mariposa County, just about all the gallery-goers have
vented their spleen at Congress. One angry TV commentator suggested
that, as a punishment, the 73 Republican freshmen in the House of
Representatives be permanently barred from looking at Vermeer's
masterpieces (though the impact of such contemplation might well be
salutary).

A more severe critic could go further by noting that few of the
affected are natural allies of the hard right. Art appeals to the elite
and is often decadent; passports are for foreign travel and thus
somehow un-American; social security is for the weak; national parks
might be more profitable if opened up for oil drilling and commercial
exploitation; and Washington itself, a veritable modern Sodom and
Gomorrah, would be better off turned into a pillar of salt.

The last word should lie, surely, with the bureaucrats. While they are
on unpaid furlough, members of Congress are receiving their salary
cheques and, as is their wont during recess, travelling the globe. So a
group of US diplomats in Latin America ordered back to work to arrange
one such six-nation trip, sent this distinctly undiplomatic message to
the state department:

'Frankly, we are disturbed by the thought that while American school
children are being turned away from Smithsonian museums, national
parks, monuments and memorials, some members of the US Congress are
looking forward to seeing exotic attractions like Copacabana, Iguazu,
Cuzco, Macchu Picchu and Otavalo - largely at the expense of the
parents of those school children.'

Perhaps they should push the congressional delegation off a cliff, in
the manner of the Incas.

THIS WEEK:
FT GUIDE TO THE MILLENNIUM COMMISSION?

   By ANTONY THORNCROFT

What, exactly, is this Millennium Commission we keep hearing about? The
body set up to plan the UK's celebration of the year 2000. Most other
countries hope to let off a few fireworks but the UK is taking it very
seriously indeed, and spending about Pounds 1.5bn.

Whose idea was it? Lord Palumbo, former chairman of the Arts Council,
thought the millennium a good excuse to spruce up Britain's national
heritage - Stonehenge, the cathedrals, that sort of thing, and perhaps
add one or two modern landmarks. Prime minister John Major agreed, and
Palumbo's idea has gathered great momentum.

Organised by a quango of the great and the good, presumably? Spot on.
Seven worthies, mixed to reflect the aristocracy, business, heritage
lobby, science and women, plus a couple of politicians (Virginia
Bottomley and Michael Heseltine) who are charged to give to it a
vote-gathering twist.

Where on earth is the money coming from? From the UK national lottery,
now a little over a year old. Projects to mark the millennium are one
of the five worthy causes that are getting great chunks of lottery
cash, along with the arts, sport, the heritage industry and charities.
To date the Millennium Commission has received almost Pounds 300m. But
unlike the other good causes, its good fortune ends on December 31
1999. After that, its share of the lottery cake will be divided among
the other four.

Hasn't the commission upset the Welsh? Yes, some of them. It was
decided to spend about Pounds 600m on 12 landmark projects, the 20th
century's gift to the future. These are to be spread conscientiously
around the UK. Wales was owed one, but the national rugby ground at
Cardiff Arms Park, and a proposed opera house for Cardiff Bay, each
applied for Pounds 50m. Forced to choose between the two Welsh
passions, rugby and music, the commission said 'No' to music and
'Maybe' to rugby. The money will probably be spent refurbishing Cardiff
Arms Park.

So all this millennial cash is not spreading universal happiness? No
way. There are as many people whingeing as celebrating, especially in
the media. The commission is accused of being short on big ideas and
long on cautious pragmatism. It has imposed severe restrictions by
demanding that applicants should be able to provide half the cost of
any project, although some of this can be in land or labour. This makes
things hard for imaginative loonies.

But some good must be coming from it? Well, the Tate Gallery is happy.
It has Pounds 50m for its proposed gallery of modern art on Bankside;
Kew Gardens has Pounds 21m for a millennium seed bank for plants; and
Portsmouth Harbour picked up Pounds 40m to convert itself into the
world's classiest marina. Scotland has been sweetened with Pounds 46m
for a 'new' Hampden Park. These are among the landmark schemes.

But I live in Twistelton-on-the-Marsh. I'll never get along to these
national monuments. The commissioners have also set aside another
Pounds 600m to engender turn-of-the-millennium optimism at the grass
roots. Over 300 groups of local activists have already received a go
ahead for good ideas. For example, there will be a new village hall for
Ingleton in Derbyshire, thanks to a millennium grant of Pounds 150,000;
a coastal railway linking the Giant's Causeway and Bushmills in
Northern Ireland will please locals and tourists, at a cost of Pounds
700,000; and Pounds 588,000 has been set aside for salmon ladders in
the River Thames.

Strengthening communities and greening the land are buzzwords the
commissioners have taken to heart. The Pounds 42.5m for Sustrans, which
aims to cover the nation with 2,500 miles of cycle paths, just about
sums it all up.

What is going to happen in 2000? Good question. No one knows, although
Imagination, a group of creative whizzkids from London, and M2000,
financed by Touche Ross and MAI among others, should have a good idea.

They are the two consortia short-listed to organise the year-long
celebration, likely to be a cross between the Festival of Britain and
Disney World. The winner will be chosen this month. Four sites have
also been short-listed: Greenwich, near London; the National Exhibition
Centre near Birmingham; Derby; and Stratford, in London.

Greenwich, the chosen venue of M2000, is favourite, while Imagination
has plumped for Birmingham.

It depends whether the commissioners go for a site in London plumb on
the international dateline, or Birmingham, near the centre of the UK.
With Pounds 100m of millennium money to oil the profit-making event, it
should be some celebration.

And on December 31 2000, is it all over? The commissioners hope not.
There will be the landmark buildings to enjoy, although there is no
equivalent to the Crystal Palace or the Eiffel Tower on the horizon to
amaze citizens of 2096. There will also be hundreds of village halls,
urban parks and small woodlands.

And there will be some bursaries, which are planned to continue ad
infinitum. What are they. Can I have one? No reason why not. The
commission is setting up a Pounds 100m endowment, which should produce
about Pounds 5m a year to be distributed in dollops of Pounds 2,000 and
upwards to citizens who want to improve themselves, and then pass on
the improvement to their communities.

More details will be announced this month, but you will probably have
to apply to a charity or a voluntary organisation for vetting. Good
luck.

THIS WEEK:
FILM AND VIDEO

   By NIGEL ANDREWS

You can always tell a new movie year. It stomps into view overturning
Christmas trees and growling 'No more Mr Nice Guy'. 1996's first
audiences are invited to choose between Seven (serial killer with
horrific murder methods), The Kingdom (ghoulies in a haunted hospital)
and Four Rooms, which climaxes with Quentin Tarantino presiding over
chopping a finger.

Nevertheless, there are compensations to be found. The faint hearted
can take refuge in France's The Horseman On The Roof - more buckle and
swash from director Jean-Paul Cyrano De Bergerac Rappeneau - and in
Something To Talk About, a marital comedy-drama with Julia Roberts. She
twangs a pretty southern accent while Robert Duvall and Gena Rowlands
provide power casting as Mom and Pop.

In truth, even the nasties are not that nasty. The Kingdom, a weirdly
hilarious TV mini-series turned four-hour movie from Danish director
Lars Von Trier, is more black comedy than spine chiller. And there is
humanity between the stomach-testing moments in Seven. Brad Pitt and
Morgan Freeman play detectives sleuthing through a series of murders
patterned after the seven deadly sins.

The moral is, if you want quality cinema you must take the rough with
the smooth. But you need not take Four Rooms at all. This quartet of
stories proves there are days when even wonder children like Tarantino
should be locked in the nursery until they get the script right.

On video, meanwhile, two films allow you to be adult and childlike at
the same time. Ed Wood is Tim Burton's funny-elegiac homage to the
world's greatest 'bad' director, with Martin Landau eating the scenery
as the horror actor Bela Lugosi.

And Dianne Wiest similarly eats the scenery in Woody Allen's splendid
showbiz comedy Bullets Over Broadway. The two actors won last year's
best-supporting Oscars.

PEOPLE: JOHN BROWNE, BP'S MASTER OF RECOVERY - A CAUTIOUS APPROACH TO
DEBT DOES NOT RULE OUT A NEW PHASE OF GROWTH

   By ROBERT CORZINE

John Browne, British Petroleum's chief executive, has marked the
completion of his first six months in office with the conclusion of a
Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.27bn) natural gas deal in Algeria.

The project, which analysts say will help turn BP into a significant
international gas company, attracted headlines mainly because of its
location in a country struggling with an Islamist insurgency. But the
deal is also noteworthy in that it will form one of the foundations for
a new phase of growth and capital investment at BP, whose last
expansive foray triggered a debt crisis in 1992 and the departure of
Robert Horton, former chairman and chief executive.

That episode still influences the thinking of John Browne and that of
Sir David Simon, BP's chairman and the man who engineered the recovery
of the company's fortunes. 'We must not leverage this company ever
again,' said one senior executive last week.

But the company says a cautious approach to debt does not mean that BP
is afraid to act decisively to ensure future growth. It has embarked on
big oil and gas projects in politically unsettled parts of the world
such as Colombia, Azerbaijan and Algeria.

Such projects are a marked departure from BP's traditional core areas
- Alaska and the UK sector of the North Sea. But during Browne's tenure
as head of the company's upstream arm, the board came to accept that
political risk is best spread across a range of projects in different
countries. 'The real risk is having too much in one basket,' says one
BP executive, 'not in going to risky countries which could have a
material effect to the company's bottom line.'

Browne also placed emphasis on the 'phased development' of such
projects. That allows the company to limit its financial exposure
during the early stages of a project, when there is likely to be
greater uncertainty about whether it will prove technically,
politically or commercially viable.

Industry observers say Browne's greatest success was in re-shaping the
strategic direction of the exploration arm and ensuring that it had a
string of possible projects to choose from. It now has sufficient
assets to ensure that reserves can be replaced for another 10 years.
That means that while many other oil companies hunt for new reserves,
BP can focus on projects that are likely to offer the highest return.

Yet analysts wonder whether Browne will have equal success tackling the
problems in BP's downstream division, the one part of the company of
which he has no direct experience and a sector in which big changes may
have an impact on BP's customer base.

He has recently devoted time to downstream issues, in particular to the
future of the company's refineries. They, like much of the industry,
suffer from thin margins and offer little scope for any technological
advantage over competitors. An announcement on the further
restructuring of the company's refining assets is expected this month.

Browne, an engineer who believes technology can continuously enhance
BP's financial performance, is upbeat about chemicals - a segment in
which proprietary technology can increase competitiveness and the
division that BP has chosen to lead its expansion in Asia.

An announcement on broader corporate aims is expected in March. There
have been rumours in the industry that Browne has contemplated radical
changes to the way BP conducts its business, with some observers
speculating that Browne, a former corporate treasurer, would like to
adopt more of a 'merchant bank' approach to the industry.

BP executives say he is more likely to maintain a step-by-step
approach, and emulate Simon by setting simple targets related to BP's
financial and performance ambitions.

One of his biggest challenges will be to maintain BP's strong financial
performance. 'You can grow from an uncompetitive base by cutting
costs,' says one executive. 'The hard task is to grow from a
competitive base, and not just capture the chemicals cycle at its top.'
That means BP will have to focus on efforts to keep margins as high as
possible even in a downturn.

Browne's strategic aim is to create a 'distinctive' company - one with
elements that competitors would have difficulty copying and one which
would provide unusual financial returns to investors. He emphasises the
importance of relationships with host governments, partners and
suppliers.

Browne also wants a 'unique' set of assets, including markets. But big
acquisitions of the type that landed BP in so much trouble in the past
appear to have been ruled out for now, although executives say BP will
continue to make small-scale acquisitions.

Browne's first six months have been made easier by BP's strong
financial performance. But in future there is likely to be greater
investor interest in how he and his colleagues deal with the narrower
issues of the downstream assets and with capital investment decisions.

Senior BP executives say investors are right to demand the highest
capital efficiency possible. After all, says one, 'the industry as a
whole has a pretty bad track record. It hasn't spent money wisely.'
What of BP specifically? 'We should expect to withstand tough
scrutiny,' he says. 'But I don't believe BP will repeat the past.'

MANAGEMENT:
BIG IDEAS, BIG BOOKS - SEVEN WISE MEN GIVE THEIR OPINIONS ON THE
CHALLENGES COMPANIES ARE LIKELY TO FACE IN 1996


What will be the big management challenge of 1996? And what was the
best/most enjoyable/most instructive business book you read in 1995?

On this page we print seven answers to these questions.

Sumantra Ghoshal, professor of strategic management at London Business
School:

Challenge: Over the past few years many companies have focused on
rationalisation and restructuring. Often this has required
fragmentation of their organisations into small units and some radical
decentralisation. Now, with much of the fat out of the system, the
challenge will be to reintegrate their fragmented organisations to
pursue new growth opportunities.

Book: The Boundaryless Organisation by Ron Ashkenas, Dave Ulrich, Todd
Jick and Steve Kerr (Jossey-Bass, San Francisco).

This is a wonderfully practical and down-to-earth book that is both
idea-rich and implementation-focused. It provides insightful ideas,
clear examples and simple tools - a rare combination in the world of
business publications.

Gerry Robinson, chief executive, Granada Group:

Challenge: Not to run out of steam. The 1980s was a period of huge
growth and expansion through new markets, new technology and a global
view of business. The 1990s have been dominated by cost control, cost
cutting, streamlining and tighter management control in order to
maintain profitable growth. This must not become the main role of
management - we must also use creativity, enthusiasm, leadership and
sound strategic direction to improve a company's health and growth.

Book: I have to confess that I did not read any business books at all
last year. This is not because I feel I have nothing to learn about
business but because I did not find the time.

The most important book I read last year was unquestionably Wild Swans
by Jung Chang (HarperCollins). Reading about China's cultural
revolution is more enlightening and satisfying than reading about the
corporate revolution.

I am a strong believer in broadening the mind in spheres other than
business.

Tim Simpson, managing director, Arthur D Little:

Challenge: 'Seventy per cent of all re-engineering projects fail',
people will tell you, misquoting one of the big change gurus. My view
is not so pessimistic. Many companies have made large-scale change work
for them, and their performance has jumped as a result.

But with the recovery faltering, and markets ever opening to world
competition, sustaining this performance improvement will be the
management challenge of 1996.

Book: 1995 was again notable more for books I wanted to read than those
I found time for. But one which did hit home was the Fifth Discipline
Fieldbook, by Senge and friends (Nicholas Brealey Publishing). Ease of
reading is one attraction - it's written for browsing and provides
usable suggestions on almost every page.

And its central proposition - that learning, and particularly team
learning, is a key part of building competence in companies - is
intuitively obvious. The book goes further, suggesting practical ways
to manage the learning process and build competence faster. And it
complements Senge's earlier, more theoretical work, with much more
practical experience.

Peter Sutherland, chairman and managing director, Goldman Sachs
International:

Challenge: To cope with the effects of globalisation. Within a very
short time the world has decisively changed and management will
increasingly be required to focus on opportunities in, and challenges
from, the emerging markets that will provide much of the economic
dynamism for the world into the next millennium. An understanding of
relatively familiar cultures and relationships will have to be
augmented by an under-standing of relatively different environments.

Book: I am not proud to admit that I have virtually never read business
books (unless written by Sir John Harvey-Jones). In 1995, however, I
have read some that I would recommend.

The first of these is Corporate Level Strategy by Goold, Campbell and
Alexander (Wiley), which looks at managing multi-business companies
such as GE, ABB and Canon.

My second and third books are not business books per se but I recommend
them because, in today's world, a good manager has to be tuned in to
dramatic political change in terms of national sovereignty. Andrew
Marr's Ruling Britannia (Michael Joseph) is about more than Britain.

It is about a world in transition. One doesn't have to agree with all
his conclusions to find his opinions both provocative and relevant.

I would also include Where Did We Go Wrong - From the Gold Standard to
Europe (Faber & Faber) by the remarkable Eric Roll, who analyses past
errors in policy relating to the British economy and, above all, to
British negativism towards European integration.

Adair Turner, director-general, Confederation of British Industry:

Challenge: Growing. British businesses have got very very good over the
past 10-15 years at being lean and mean, at increasing productivity.

They need now to get better at investing for the long term, at
marketing, at creating new products. A stable economic climate should
make this possible.

Book: Not business but economics, and not one but two. The State We're
In by Will Hutton (Cape). Disagreed with lots of it and almost gave up
after the first two pages of polemic, but provocative and insightful if
you persevere. And The World in 2020 by Hamish McRae (HarperCollins),
crystal-ball gazing with insight.

David Wellings, chief executive, Cadbury Schweppes:

Challenge: The same as always. Putting forward the best face possible
on the past in order to attract investors; scanning the latest mountain
for that elusive and obstacle-strewn path to shareholder value; and
ensuring that managers of vision, tenacity and stamina are there to
step in when you eventually fall off the mountain.

Book: Neville Bain's Successful Management (Macmillan Business). Sound,
practical advice from a businessman to businessmen. Blessed relief from
consultants peddling the latest irrelevant buzzword for keeping in
shape 'corporate re-engineering' or motivation 'empowerment'.

George Yip, adjunct professor of strategy at the University of
California, Los Angeles (UCLA):

Challenge: Multinational companies will continue to face in 1996 the
challenge of globalisation and of building global capability.

A successful global company today needs the capability to access and to
transfer anywhere in the world technology, ideas, factors of
production, and other sources of competitive advantage.

In this regard the biggest challenge will be moving executives around
the world in the face of escalating costs.

Book: Strategic Alliances: An Entrepreneurial Approach to Globalization
by Michael Y. Yoshino and U. Srinivasa Rangan (Harvard Business School
Press).

Strategic alliances are a major method for globalisation and this is
the best book I have read to date on the international aspects of this
subject.

MANAGEMENT:
A PRODUCT OF POETRY - RUPERT MORRIS WONDERS HOW FAMOUS VERSE COULD BE
USED IN ADVERTISING

   By RUPERT MORRIS

Readers of the Management Page may have noticed that Union Bank of
Switzerland has been using poetry in its advertisements.

'Thoughts that transcend time from Union Bank of Switzerland' have
appeared on global satellite and cable channels, featuring Sir John
Gielgud and others reading classic poems like Ozymandias, Ulysses and
so on.

The poetry was chosen, according to project manager Vincento
Travaglione, to embody corporate values of 'responsibility, openness,
courage and perseverance'.

Of course, there is nothing new about poetry in advertising. In the
early years of this century, we were regaled with gems like these: The
Onoto, the Owl and the Waverley pen, They come as a boon and a blessing
to men . .

Or the following, proclaiming the attraction of Everybody's, a popular
magazine of the inter-war years: Oh Mr Porter, whatever shall I do? I
was reading my Everybody's and got carried on to Crewe] Copy-writing
was in its infancy in those days, I suppose, which may explain why
these excruciating verses lasted for several years; and yet they were
probably extremely effective, imprinting themselves on the popular
consciousness in much the same way as the catchiest pop songs.

Nowadays, alas, advertisers are more image-conscious. You can't imagine
the Body Shop using some naff rhyme, can you? Ovaltine is the
honourable exception, resurrecting the delightful song of those 'happy
girls and boys', the 'Ovalteenies'.

But Advico Young and Rubicam, the Zurich agency which dreamed up the
UBS campaign, have been doubly smart. Not only have they regaled TV
viewers with some decent poems for a change, subtly enhancing their
client's image; they have also done it on the cheap by using authors
who are long out of copyright.

There is no end to the number of commercial interests that might
benefit from a quick glance through the Oxford Book of English Verse.

Brewers, for instance, need look no further than AE Housman. Indeed,
Ind Coope should surely consider funding an AE Housman chair of poetry
at its Burton-on-Trent headquarters.

No modern copy-writer could improve on this passage from A Shropshire
Lad: Say, for what hop-yards meant, Or why was Burton built on Trent?
Oh many a peer of England brews Livelier liquor than the Muse. And malt
does more than Milton can To justify God's ways to man. Ale, man, ale's
the stuff to drink For fellows whom it hurts to think.

Your AB audience might blench somewhat at the last line, but
self-conscious intellectuals are not usually beer drinkers anyway, so I
don't think we need worry.

Haircare has been a fruitful medium for advertisers, and yet one does
feel that there is a certain creative vacuum in this field.

Purveyors of hair bleach must despair of that stubborn group of
independent-minded modern women who refuse to emulate the models with
flowing locks on their screens and become bottle blondes. Perhaps they
should try a touch of Wordsworth: Earth hath not anything to show more
fair  .

And if that doesn't work, there's always Eliot: Stand on the highest
pavement of the stair - Lean on a garden urn Weave, weave the sunlight
in your hair On reflection, this verse might be more appropriate for
wigmakers. But that's the joy of poetry as an advertising medium. It's
so flexible.

Other products and services might not be so easy. It is certainly time
the army came up with something better than that macho stuff with young
lads driving tanks, swimming, skiing and and generally behaving like
would-be contestants on Gladiators. How about something that brings out
those unchanging values of selfless patriotism? The Soldier, by Rupert
Brooke, has the right combination of gravitas and romanticism. But that
first line is a bit of a downer: 'If I should die . .' You might as
well make it a commercial for funeral services.

Now there's a thought. Undertakers have been loath to advertise up to
now, but poetry might give them just the opportunity they need. The
words of the American Stephen Vincent Benet spring to mind: You may
bury my body in Sussex grass, You may bury my tongue in Champmedy, I
shall not be there, I shall rise and pass. Bury my heart at Wounded
Knee.

At Berry & Birnam we always respect the wishes of the departed. Organ
refrigeration a speciality. Or something like that.

MANAGEMENT:
LIQUID THERAPY FOR THE NEW YEAR

   By LUCY KELLAWAY

Ihave not been myself recently. Not since I filled my body with a
strange orange liquid at the start of the festive season. The incident
was quite out of character and the memory of it leaves me feeling
sheepish and puzzled even now. Lest you conclude that I went wild on
the mandarin liqueur, I should assure you that my liquid was imaginary
and that it has made me calmer, unflappable, ready for the new year.

The bizarre story began when a lady named Deborah Marshall-Warren
offered me a free trial of something called Orange Liquid Therapy. She
said this was a 'mental de-tox' session that involved hypnotism, deep
relaxation and direct suggestion to sooth all my stresses away. Halfway
round the bend with pre-Christmas strain at the time, I felt willing to
try anything. When she told me her practice was in Regent Street, that
clinched it: I could sort myself out and do some Christmas shopping as
well.

Yet when I arrived at her office, I started to feel uneasy. There was
an unnatural calm about Ms Marshall-Warren. Her eyes were red and she
looked as if she had been crying for weeks. We sat in a tiny cubicle as
hot as the Sahara and lit by a large bright globe. 'I'm going to put
you under quickly', she said. Obediently, I sat in the chair and tried
to relax. I looked at the spot on her hand. I closed my eyes. 'Feel
your calves filling with a warm, orange liquid', she crooned. 'It is
soothing, tingling, and it is moving, up, up into your knees. Feel your
knees filling with a warm, orange liquid. It is soothing, tingling. It
is moving, up, up into your thighs . .' You get the picture.

When I was full to the brim with orange liquid, I had to imagine it
scrubbing out my cares, fears, anxieties, fizzing and dissolving them
in much the same way that Domestos gets to work with stubborn household
stains. Then, when there was no more work for it to do, I was told to
picture it slowly draining out through my fingers and toes. Clean and
emptied, I was informed that I was feeling lighter, more confident,
better able to cope and happier.

Set down in black and white, orange liquid therapy sounds daft as a
brush. I am constitutionally opposed to New Age nonsense. I do not
believe in trendy miracle cures for complex problems. The sort of
stress relief that makes sense to me is to work less, drink less or to
go on holiday.

So imagine my bewilderment to find myself feeling much better after 45
minutes of semi-conscious sloshing around in make-believe coloured
fluid. Before entering the cubicle I felt tense, on the verge of
hysteria. Afterwards I was cheerful, unbothered even by Oxford Circus
in the rain at rush hour, and more or less equal to Christmas.

Yet when I tell my friends and colleagues my wonderful hypnotism story
they give me a wary look. As far as they are concerned, I've started on
a slippery slope, and soon I will be pushing all kinds of dubious
management gimmicks. I insist I am still the same person. They are not
so sure. We shall see.

1995 was the year in which the re-engineering craze died. A
replacement, developed by McKinsey and explained in the consultant's
latest quarterly bulletin is called: Do It, Then Fix It. I like this
new fad more than the old one, because it comes in words of one
syllable. The idea behind it is equally hard to argue with: companies
should work out what changes to their business need to be made, then
they should carry them out without more ado. Once done, they should
assess the result, and if it has flaws, they should swiftly put them
right. Indeed, this seems to be such a sensible way of going about
things, it is a mystery to me why companies need McKinsey to spell it
out to them.

In the middle of all the change that companies are supposed to be
undergoing, one thing remains constant: workers feel their bosses do
not have their best interests at heart.

Never mind all the empowerment, teamwork and egalitarian structures,
employees take the same dim view of their managers as they always have
done. According to actuaries Watson Wyatt, less than half believe their
company is well managed, or think that their bosses make the right
strategic decisions.

The only thing that has changed in recent years is that workers now
view their superiors as hypocrites: good at drawing up a set of values
for the company, less good at living by those values themselves.

I realise it is not for me to volunteer new year's resolutions for
others, especially as I have not made any for myself. But might it not
be time for senior managers to start practising what they preach? I
used to think that human behaviour was difficult to change, in
particular that old dogs could not be taught new tricks. But now I am
not so sure. Dare I recommend a little hypnotherapy? On second thoughts
it would only work if they wanted to change. And that, surely, is the
problem.

MANAGEMENT: TEGE - FAST TRACK

   By IAN RODGER

Why not start the new year by acquiring a share in Tege, the Swiss
company that is developing a french-fries vending machine?

That's right, insert a Pounds 1 coin, wait about a minute and out pops
a fresh, hot portion of french fries. Well, almost. The vending machine
is still in the prototype stage and unlikely to be on the streets of
Europe until next spring.

Nevertheless Tege's shares soared to a high of nearly SFr74 (Pounds
41.50) on the Geneva Stock Exchange last May, valuing the company at an
impressive SFr68m. They slid recently to SFr48 after it became apparent
that the planned launch would be delayed by about six months.

The machine - or rather the french fries production system - is the
brainchild of Richard Sorensen, an American inventor. Sorensen joined
six European investors, including Jacques Hennessy (of the Cognac
house) after an initial association with a US venture-capital company
turned sour.

They claim to have put about Dollars 6m (Pounds 3.8m) into the venture
to date. Early last year they reversed into a derelict quoted Swiss
funicular company, Tege, and transferred all the patents to it.
Together they hold 55 per cent of Tege's 920,000 bearer shares.

Patrick Bigger, a Swiss who is chief executive, said they chose a Swiss
incorporation because many of the institutional investors in the
project are Swiss and wanted a Swiss franc share. Operations, however,
are based in England, where a three-month market test with 25 machines
is scheduled to start next March.

The problem with producing french fries is that the fries quickly
become soggy. Thus a vending machine can only work if it makes a fresh
portion every time. Sorensen's solution is to use potato powder.

Once an order is made, a given amount of powder is measured and mixed
with water to achieve a dough-like substance. The dough cube is pressed
through an extruder into french fries which fall into four steel
baskets in a pot of hot oil. The baskets revolve slowly around the oil
pot and a minute later tip the fries into a chute where they fall into
a cardboard sleeve.

The clever bit, claims Bigger, is the composition of the powder, which
contains patented additives that make it form into a perfectly
consistent dough within five seconds. Any dough left lying about
quickly reverts to harmless dry powder.

The oil is kept at 220'C, well below its boiling point, and is
frequently stirred even if no orders are being taken. It is also
automatically filtered and topped up for losses that go with the fries.

Tege executives are now setting up licensing and marketing arrangements
in many countries and spinning out creative sales and profit forecasts.
In one projection, 1999 net income comes in at SFr92.9m.

They plan both to sell and lease machines and supply the magic powder.
A machine will sell for about SFr15,000 and revenue and earnings
projections are based on portions being sold for Pounds 1, DM1.50
(Pounds 0.67), FFr4.50 (Pounds 0.58), or SFr1.80. They assume the
average machine will sell 50 portions a week.

The company needs another Dollars 6m or so to cover its costs until
revenues start flowing in. A convertible bond issue is the most likely
route, says Bigger.

BUSINESS TRAVEL:
HOTELIER'S STARCK CHOICE - IAN SCHRAGER'S HOTELS ARE FOR THOSE WHO CAN
AFFORD CHINTZ BUT WANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT

   By ALICE RAWSTHORN

On paper, Ian Schrager looks like the sort of self-indulgent
businessman who is rather too self-indulgent for his own good.

He did, after all, fly 80 palm trees from Washington to the Delano
hotel he opened in Miami last summer, because they were more attractive
than the local crop. And, after taking a closer look at the sand on
nearby Miami Beach, he shipped in a ton-and-a-half of a superior
variety.

Yet Schrager is not just another architecture junkie who allows
aesthetic excess to cloud his business judgment. He can rattle off the
profit margins on almost every aspect of the Delano and of his three
New York hotels. He has harnessed his love of design to turn them into
the hotels of choice for what he calls 'the generation that wants
something different' - artists, actors, designers and musicians who can
afford four-star or five-star establishments but find them rather
boring.

The three New York hotels - the Royalton, Morgans and the Paramount -
are almost always fully booked. The Delano in Miami is so popular that
last month's American Vogue prefaced an article on other Miami hotels
by saying: 'If you can't get into the Delano . . . .'. Schrager is now
renovating the Mondrian Hotel in Los Angeles and searching for a site
in London.

The progress of his business career has been erratic, to say the least.
He made his name in the late 1970s with Studio 54, a New York nightclub
that he ran with his university roommate, the late Steve Rubell. Studio
54 captured the hedonistic spirit of the late 1970s. But in 1980
Schrager and Rubell were sentenced to 3 1/2 years in prison for tax
evasion.

After their release they opened a nightclub, the Palladium, and
diversified into hotels. Neither had any experience of the business,
but they knew what sort of place to open. 'There was no point in
opening another luxury hotel,' says Schrager. 'That end of the business
was well served by Claridges in London, the Bel Air in LA and the
Carlyle in New York. They serve room service course by course at
Claridges. You can't beat that.'

They sensed a need for a new type of luxury hotel for the sort of
people who used to go to Studio 54 - people who wanted, and were
willing to pay for, the comfort and service they got in conventional
luxury hotels, but would prefer a less formal setting more in tune with
their taste than the chintzy interior of Claridges.

They started by renovating Morgans, a discreet mid-town hotel with 154
rooms built in the late 1920s. Schrager commissioned Andree Putman, the
French designer, to refurbish Morgans in her understatedly elegant
modernist style, but they were more adventurous in their choice of
designer for the next hotel, the Royalton, which they entrusted to the
flamboyant Frenchman, Philippe Starck. Schrager worked with Starck
again on the Paramount, an equally extrovert but less expensive hotel
that opened in 1990.

Each of the New York hotels has its own character. The Royalton is the
most audacious. The Paramount is for people who love the Royalton but
cannot quite afford it. And Morgans is the most discreet. Schrager
ensures there is a difference of at least Dollars 50 (Pounds 32)
between the room rates: Dollars 250 for the Royalton, Dollars 200 for
Morgans and Dollars 100 for the Paramount. They all have an average
occupancy rate of more than 90 per cent, against the US industry
average of 71 per cent.

'Coming from the nightclub business was great training for running an
hotel,' says Schrager. 'You're selling a commodity product. A nightclub
sells the same drink and plays the same music as the competition. The
only thing that differentiates them is production values. It's the same
with hotels.'

Production values are Schrager's forte. Starck, with whom he
collaborated on the Delano's all-white interior and Alice In Wonderland
garden, is prodigiously talented but notoriously difficult to work
with. Schrager's solution is to set up a project management team of
architects, art directors and buyers to implement Starck's ideas and
bring them in on budget.

'After doing three hotels with Philippe, we know what to expect,' says
Schrager. 'We don't panic when we get these weird faxes from him.' This
system has produced some of Starck's best work. He is one of the
world's most sought-after designers who receives three or four requests
a month to design hotels, but says 'no to all of them, except Ian'.

All Schrager's hotels look expensive. The fittings are specially
commissioned and the renovation budgets seem high - Dollars 28m for the
Delano, Dollars 35m for the Royalton, Dollars 60m for the 610-room
Paramount. But Schrager is careful to buy existing hotels which will be
easy to convert. 'We replace everything, even the plumbing, but leave
the rooms intact. You can get into trouble by banging on walls.' He
says it would cost 'much more' to kit out his hotels in conventional
chintz than in a sumptuous Starck design.

His latest project is the Mondrian in Los Angeles. It was purpose-built
as a 1960s apartment hotel and is now being redesigned by Starck, who
says he wants it to be 'very, very white with one or two symbols of
colour' to emphasise the 'dreaminess of LA'. Schrager has asked artist
James Turrell to create a 'three-dimensional living art piece' for the
foyer 'so it will be like walking into an artwork.'

As his hotel chain expands, Schrager has cut costs by pooling areas
such as purchasing and marketing. He is careful to concentrate on room
rental, and licenses out services such as bars, restaurants and gyms.
Brian McNally, who has turned the Royalton's '44' into one of
Manhattan's most chic restaurants, runs the Delano's Blue Room with pop
star Madonna as a co-investor. Schrager even licenses the newsstands.
'When we ran the newsstand at the Paramount, it lost Dollars 1,000 a
month. We've given it to a guy who knows the business and it makes
Dollars 4,500 a month.'

The Mondrian is scheduled for completion in October and Schrager will
then expand outside the US. He has hunted for sites in London without
success, although Granada's hostile Pounds 3.3bn bid for Forte could
create some opportunities.

'My customers travel on a certain axis,' says Schrager. 'New York,
Miami and Los Angeles are on it, so are London and Paris. You couldn't
open hotels like mine just anywhere because there wouldn't be enough
people to fill it. And I'd put as much effort into a place with 17
rooms as I would into one with 700.'

BUSINESS TRAVEL:
BANGKOK GETS TOUGH ON MOTORISTS


More than 100 people were arrested on the first day of a campaign by
Bangkok police to force motorists to heed traffic regulations as part
of an attempt to unsnarl the city's gridlock.

In Bangkok, known for the world's worst traffic jams, drivers routinely
flout the rules. Violators often slip the police small bribes and are
swiftly on their way.

Car sales in 1995 are expected to have topped 500,000, making Thailand
the largest car market in south-east Asia. But only 8 per cent of
Bangkok's land surface is covered by roads, compared to 25 per cent in
New York and Paris. Short trips in the city can take hours.

Bangkok's traffic problem is affecting the city's development. Some
foreign businesses have decided to locate elsewhere, and tourists spend
less time and money in the capital, citing their aversion to the
traffic. The campaign is part of a plan by Thaksin Shinawatra, a
billionaire businessman and deputy prime minister, who was elected last
July on a pledge that he would solve Bangkok's traffic problems in six
months or resign. Thaksin's deadline - January 26 - is approaching with
no noticeable improvement in traffic conditions.

However, the World Bank recently announced it will provide a Dollars
150m (Pounds 97m) loan to Thailand to help alleviate its traffic
problems. Maurice Le-Blanc of the bank said: 'The government of
Thailand has taken a leading role in the region in addressing
environmental and road safety issues in an aggressive manner, which to
date have proved very successful. This will further those efforts.'

For those who can make it through the traffic, Bangkok's first
Cyberpub has just opened, providing a focus for the party-loving
after-work crowd. For Dollars 12 an hour, customers can sit at one of
10 glass-topped tables equipped with a Compaq Presario.

Getting into the spirit of things, an opening night trio of women
clicked on to a virtual dating service which bills itself as 'Your link
to true love'. As the picture and vital statistics of a young hunk from
New York appeared on the screen, one adjusted her glasses and took a
closer look.

The Cyberpub is in the same ownership as the local upmarket Dusit Thani
hotel chain.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: CARRIERS CUT FARES


British Airways is cutting fares to almost 100 destinations until
January 17 as part of of its World Offers. The largest saving, Pounds
358, is on return flights to Harare, with prices starting at Pounds
599. Fares to Nairobi start at Pounds 439, down Pounds 356. BA fares to
Australian cities Darwin and Perth will be Pounds 561, saving Pounds
161 on the regular lowest fares, with Adelaide, Brisbane, Cairns,
Melbourne and Sydney prices cut by Pounds 124 to Pounds 699. USAir has
reduced its everyday advance purchase ticket prices for spring and
summer travel by up to 44 per cent. The move came a day after a flurry
of winter fare cuts of up to 50 per cent initiated by Delta Air Lines,
which was swiftly matched by most of its competitors.

Italian air traffic controllers have signed a new wage agreement,
ending their long fight for more money, a union official said. The
accord will give controllers a 6 per cent salary rise for the period
1994-95. More talks will be needed to hammer out a settlement for
1996-97.

AIRPORT ON TRACK


Hong Kong's new USDollars 20bn airport project, including
infrastructure and reclamation, is almost half finished, the government
said yesterday. At the start of last month the 10 core projects were 46
per cent complete.

Billy Lam, director of the new airport's co-ordination office, said the
project, which will replace congested Kai Tak airport, was on schedule
and within budget. Seven of the projects are government-funded.

'Our target remains that the first planes will be flying out of Hong
Kong's new international airport at Chek Lap Kok in April 1998 and I am
confident that the total cost will be within our budget of Dollars
20.3bn,' Lam said.

BUSINESS TRAVEL:
CASH IN THE SKY


A high-tech business partly owned by a former Israel Air Force
commander has miniaturised the technology needed to recognise
banknotes, and introduced a product it hopes will turn aircraft into
flying banks.

Inflight Financial Services is negotiating with Israel's El Al airline
and US-based carriers such as United Airlines and Delta to install its
Aero-Cash automatic currency exchange machine on regular flights.

The company has developed a way of reducing bulky automatic exchange
machines to a lightweight, suitcase-sized package that easily

operates on aircraft, it said. Company president Mony Lichman said the
machine, which exchanges US dollars and seven European currencies for
any other money, 'will become a fixture on airplanes and change the way
travellers bank'.

United Airlines said it was considering using Aero-Cash on its flights
but had not yet finalised terms. The machine accepts credit cards and
will charge no commission, Lichman said.

Inflight Financial Services is a multinational company partly owned and
managed by Israelis. Some of the development work on Aero-Cash was done
in Belgium.

AIRPORT THREATENED


Russian airport police intervened last week to prevent a group of
businessmen from taking control of the VIP lounge at Moscow's main
international airport.

Anatoly Koryakin, director of the Sheremetyevo-2 airport, said the
businessmen had appeared in the lounge with a bailiff and police in
what seemed to be a property dispute. Some were armed with Kalashnikov
automatic rifles.

'Thanks to the intervention of airport security officers, order was
restored and work on receiving official delegations continued,'
Koryakin said.

MEDIA FUTURES:
POBOX AND THE MAGIC COOKIE

   By TIM DICKSON

Which company will have the greatest effect on the development of the
Internet this year? My answer is neither Microsoft nor Netscape. It is
a tiny new company in Philadelphia called Pobox. com - spelt as if it
were an abbreviation of Post Office Box, but pronounced as the single
word 'Pobox'. Its product consists of a simple forwarding service that
is an electronic equivalent of a post office box.

The system works as follows. Customers give out an e-mail address
ending in pobox. com - like the one that appears at the bottom of this
column. When their friends or colleagues send them e-mail at that
address, a computer in Philadelphia looks up the recipient in a data
base and forwards the message immediately to their Internet provider.

This service allows people to give out an e-mail address that is
independent of where they work or where they choose to buy Internet
access. Moving from one Internet provider to another is simply a matter
of sending a message to pobox. com giving a new forwarding address and
quoting a 'magic cookie', a number that establishes the customer's
authenticity.

I have already discovered an advantage of the service. Having recently
moved from London to Silicon Valley in order to work on a book, I have
switched Internet providers. But my address has remained the same, and
messages sent to me as if I were in London are forwarded to me in
California without my having had to tell anyone how to reach me.

Yet people moving house are not the sole market. Other potential users
includes customers of CompuServe, which allows people to use only an
indecipherable string of numbers as their e-mail address.

Equally attracted will be those who are embarrassed by the cumbersome
length or strange letter-and-number combination of their real e-mail
address.

The entrepreneurs behind Pobox. com are a pair of students at the
University of Pennsylvania, still living in a college dormitory: Reuven
Bell, 23, whose subject is religious studies, and Meng-Weng Wong, 21, a
computer science major born in Singapore. The two launched their
service in early 1995, and already have 3,000 users. In keeping with
the principle that most of the best Internet businesses start off by
giving things away, the pair offer a generous free trial lasting three
months.

Thereafter, the price for forwarding mail starts from Dollars 15 a
year, payable by credit card - with the incentive of six years for the
price of five to those who choose to pay Dollars 55 in advance.

Three months is exactly right for the trial period. It is long enough
for customers to become comfortable with the service and to give their
new e-mail address to all their friends, but not long enough for anyone
to find it worthwhile to start again with a new name from scratch.

So far, 850 electronic invoices have been sent out, and almost half
have been paid. Because of a glitch in the billing software, Bell and
Wong have not yet had time to send out reminders. But early indications
are promising, and the pair claim that an automated trawl of Internet
newsgroups has turned up more than 1,000 mentions of their service,
only one of which was negative.

Whether Pobox. com will make serious money or not is too early to
predict. Its founders certainly hope so. Bell has just taken time off
from his degree to work on the business 12 hours a day, and is planning
to pursue some Wharton MBA courses on his return to academia. Moreover,
the company already has imitators: a sign, surely, that others see the
potential in its idea.

Even a modest success could have a sharp effect on the Net. It would
remove the fear of changing e-mail address that forces many to stay
with an unsatisfactory service provider. In doing so, Pobox. com's
success would make a large global industry significantly more
competitive.

Talking of magic cookies, someone recently sent me the following
story by e-mail. A woman who had eaten a delicious cookie at the cafe
of a department store in Dallas asked for the recipe. 'We don't give it
out,' said the waiter. However, the customer persisted and offered to
pay for the recipe.

On hearing that the price would be 'two fifty', she agreed to charge it
to her credit card along with the bill for her lunch, and was then
handed the recipe on a printed sheet. Thirty days later, her Visa
statement revealed she had been charged Dollars 250.

The furious cookie lover called the company's head office, thinking
that the real figure should have been Dollars 2.50, but was told there
was no mistake.

The Dollars 250 was to insure that not just anyone could afford the
recipe. Accordingly, her request for a refund had to be turned down,
but the woman got her own back in the end.

She copied the recipe into an e-mail, which she posted to all her
friends. They posted it to their friends, and they in turn to theirs.
'I paid for it,' her e-mail said, 'so you can have it for free.'

I find it hard to imagine that the department store named in the e-mail
would behave in such a pig-headed way.

But even if apocryphal, the story illustrates the power of the
Internet. By the time you read this, tens of thousands of people may
have baked cookies according to the recipe without paying Dollars 250.
And the name of the store chain will have been blackened on computer
screens all over the world.

MEDIA FUTURES:
HOME SHOPPING TAKES A TUMBLE FROM ITS TROLLEY - ENTHUSIASTIC PREDICTIONS
OF A COUCH-POTATO FUTURE WERE PREMATURE

   By WINSTON FLETCHER

A funny thing has happened. Home shopping, that supposedly
trail-blazing benefit of interactive television, has fallen out of its
supermarket trolley.

Less than a year ago the pundits were predicting a couch-potato future
for us all. Sitting comfortably in front of our screens, we would surf
the stores and trawl the malls. Never again need we venture into the
rough, tough world of Marks and Spencer or Sainsbury's. We would
click-on, cruise-thru', and our cyber-shopping trollies would be filled
by techno-magic.

Well, it hasn't happened yet. But is it on its way?

The picture is confused as there are two types of televisual home
shopping. First, conventional satellite/cable channels offering
merchandise in a fairly traditional way. Second, shopping emporia -
mostly American - are burgeoning on the Net.

The more knowledgeable US home shopping gurus have long been suspicious
of the forecast explosion in their marketplace. QVC, America's largest,
highest profile home-shopping channel, mostly sells jewellery (42 per
cent of its turnover) and clothing (18 per cent). For clothing, the
return rate is about 40 per cent.

A couple of years ago QVC's then retiring chairman, Joseph Segel, said
in a notable speech: 'The number of people tuned to a particular
channel when your advertising runs is likely to be a small fraction of
the number you could reach with direct mail. The cost of running a
shopping channel is much greater than most people realise. Some system
developers and their software programmers assume that consumers are
itching to be converted from passive to interactive TV viewers.
Certainly there are some people who fit that mould. But I venture to
say that the great American public prefers just to watch television and
let someone else do the work.'

In turn, futurologist John Naisbitt's well-informed Trend Letter - a
publication understandably keen to embrace almost anything and
everything new under the sun - recently asked: 'Is the much-hyped age
of online shopping about to bloom? Not really.' The same issue of Trend
Letter reported that 'merchants on the Internet are reluctant to
solicit credit-card numbers for payment, lest hackers steal account
numbers' - a little cybernetic difficulty that has by no means been
resolved.

Nonetheless, research estimates suggest that 2m online purchases were
made in the US in the last year. That sounds an awful lot until you
remember that it equates to a single purchase by less than 1 per cent
of America's population. And Americans, particularly those living way
out nowhere, have always been catalogue shoppers, so direct marketing
has always been big business in the US.

It is a far-flung country, and even with gasolene as cheap as Coke it
doesn't make a lot of sense to drive hundreds of miles for a rubber
grommet. In other words, established home shoppers may just be
switching media, from print to Net - without new shoppers being
inveigled into the couch-potato lifestyle.

Where Americans are slow to lead, Europeans are even slower to follow.
At the end of 1994 a study of the multimedia marketplace in Europe
carried out by leading research group Inteco reported that the demand
for home shopping was non existent. 'No one in the study,' it
proclaimed, 'showed any interest in being able to order goods
electronically.'

The progress of home shopping in Britain confirms that. QVC started
with a bang in the UK but sales appear to be stabilising at about
Pounds 50m annually - not a lot with which to run a full-time channel
and supply some 300,000 customers.

Part of the reason for this disappointing growth is the result, I
suspect, of the hype attached to the phrase 'virtual reality'.
Televisual shopping, it is claimed, provides 'virtual reality'. In a
virtual reality supermarket you can whiz round the aisles picking up a
pack of this and a jar of that as you skid past the shelves. It sounds
so futuristic, so clever, that we have been seduced into believing it
would be wonderful. But would it?

It would certainly be fun once or twice, like a video game. But we all
know what has happened to the sales of video games. The problem is that
virtual reality really doesn't bear much resemblance to reality.

We encounter reality through our five senses: sight, sound, smell,
taste and touch. So-called virtual reality offers reality in - at best
- two dimensions: sight and sound. Sight is the most important single
sense involved when we go shopping. But it is not the only one.

As supermarkets are well aware, smell is all-important. That is why
they put fruit and vegetables at the front of the store, and bake their
own bread. For many products, touch is as important as smell. ('If you
don't want the goods, don't muck 'em about', went the old
costermongers' injunction, to restrain customers from manhandling the
produce).

Paradoxically, it is in the area of sight that virtual reality is least
real. If Bill Gates, the boss of Microsoft, believes that projecting
huge cyber-blowups of great masterpieces on to his walls will convey
even a tad of their artistic merit, it is as well he never tried to
major in aesthetics.

But never mind great paintings. Would you even buy fresh meats or fish,
or even fruits and vegetables, without seeing them in the flesh? If
people didn't want to inspect the goods carefully and choose the
freshest, why would they shop at the deli counter? The newest Tesco
stores now have large old-fashioned butcher's sections. And if you want
to inspect groceries before you buy them, why not shop for the lot at
one stop?

Apart from groceries, the sector that has generated most chatter among
the marketing classes - but again, little action so far - is cars. (The
marketing classes are not much interested in jewellery - not in selling
it, anyway).

Automotive gurus constantly predict that the end of the showroom is
nigh: motorists, it is said, will compare and contrast different models
on-screen before selecting their test-drive short-list. And one day,
even the test-drive will be taken on-screen.

The assumption is that video information is more appealing to motorists
than printed or personal (showroom) information. Maybe. But feel,
comfort, guidance - even smell - are important reasons for showroom
visits, and cannot be duplicated by 'virtual reality'.

Which may explain why the only area in which home shopping seems to be
taking off is one in which virtual reality is virtually non-existent -
the marketing, not of goods, but of services, particularly financial
services.

As financial products are, so to speak, invisible and intangible, they
are ideal for telephone selling. While financial service providers
increasingly use direct response television advertising
cost-effectively, their commercials could hardly be described as
virtual reality. Or indeed, in many cases, as reality of any sort.

Not that home shopping is not going to grow. It will, but it will be
slow and highly specialised. Delivery takes time and costs money. Many
people, perhaps most, will never feel comfortable with computers.
Forget those middle-class parental boasts of brilliantly sophisticated
computer-literate kids; think, instead, about all the underprivileged,
computer-illiterate kids.

Nor is home shopping quite as revolutionary as cyberbuffs believe.
Almost exactly a century ago the Victorians were opening up their own
version of the information superhighway (and with at least as much
hyperbole). The UK postal service, the railways, the telephone and the
telegram were bustin' out all over. Telegrams were described - as new
media so frequently are described by their sponsors - as 'the boldest
advertisements in modern times.'

By the turn of the century, all the great London department stores had
mail-order departments. Harrods, which pioneered home shopping by
telephone, rejoiced in the telephonic address EVERYTHING, LONDON.
Whiteley's in Bayswater boasted they could supply anything 'from a pin
to an elephant' door-to-door.

And the Army and Navy store sped huge mail-order catalogues to its
customers in every corner of the globe, carrying within their covers a
cornucopia of sumptuous and succulent merchandise. Moreover, delivery
was often a good deal faster and cheaper than it generally would be
today.

Home shopping may yet be the bonanza of the future. But I wouldn't bet
my Tesco shares on it.

MEDIA FUTURES: CYBER SIGHTINGS

   By STEPHEN MCGOOKIN

Kicking off this US presidential election year, the Doonesbury Town
Hall site (www. doonesbury. com/ main. html), based on Garry Trudeau's
consistently brilliant strip cartoon, looks a fine way of keeping tabs
on the campaign as it unfolds. The site (slogan: 'Join the fight
against cluelessness') has a daily news briefing and links to the
PoliticsUSA resource, as well as a chat hall and a straw poll. Top
notch.

As access increases to the former Soviet Union and eastern and central
Europe, the Prague-based Open Media Research Institute (www. omri. cz) -
a successor to Radio Free Europe - offers useful resources including a
daily digest of economic issues affecting the region.

A new site from United Airlines (www. ual. com) is an example of how a
primarily corporate marketing site can be user-friendly and
informative. Very well done, nice graphics, not too much text per page
and easy to navigate around.

The Taiwan Business Directory (http://business. com. tw) is a searchable
guide to products and companies from Taiwan. It's indexed by company
name and, comprehensively, by product classification. There are eight
contact entries alone under the heading Food and using the sub-category
Soy Sauce.

Empower (www. megalinx. net/empower) is 'Black America's Magazine for
the
Information Age', with a newswire, articles about the affirmative
action debate, and a good business profile feature, focusing on
African-American achievers.

SPORT:
GREEN TURNS DARK FOR THE STRUGGLING GOLF CLUB PRO

   By KEITH WHEATLEY

Peter Alliss recently observed that the average club golfer expects the
local professional to play like Nick Faldo, teach like John Jacobs and
be as good a shopkeeper as Marks and Spencer.

Very few club members realise how much of an endangered species the
non- tour golf professional is about to become, especially in Britain,
the home of golf. Traditionally, the pro has received a small retainer
from his club but earned the bulk of his living selling equipment and
giving lessons.

Yet selling equipment to club members is becoming virtually impossible
as the tiniest of retailers strives to compete against specialist chain
stores such as American Golf Discount and Nevada Bob's.

'The members don't realise what a financial strain it is to carry the
stock on a big overdraft and they can be such fickle customers,' says
Haydn Darrell, the pro at the small Devon club of Sidmouth. 'I'll see
them turn up to play with a new set of clubs and I won't even have had
the chance to match the price they've paid from one of the big chain
stores.'

Darrell's experience is echoed nationally. A recent report from the
specialist Golf Research Group predicted that the 2,400 retail outlets
supplying the UK golf equipment market will have shrunk to only 200 to
300 shops within a year or two.

'The traditional pro shop just cannot survive,' says Colin Hegarty,
head of GRG. 'The average gross turnover is around Pounds 110,000 a
year and they cannot stock the shop and survive on that kind of
volume.'

His figures show that the bigger retail outlets are growing fast, with
a matching shrinkage at the smaller end. Hegarty says the club pro has
two options: 'Get out of the business quickly: it's better to take a
big loss than stay and starve to death. Or become an Alan Walker.'

Walker is a former club pro - 10 years at the coalface - who realised
he was a doomed species in a thriving industry, so he now has a
high-volume shop adjoining his Warren Park driving range in Essex, plus
a management company looking after a nearby pay-and-play course.

Walker says that club pros have lost their retail business
'frighteningly quickly. Five years ago it was a Pounds 130,000 average
turnover with a 35 per cent margin. That's all over.'

His own shop turns over slightly more than Pounds 1m a year, but a
branch of American Golf Discount has just opened on Walker's doorstep.

'We're being hurt,' he admits. 'Teaching alone isn't the answer to
replacing lost income. Firstly, statistics show that the British are
the worst golfers in the world in terms of readiness to take
instruction. Secondly, it's too seasonal. Who's having a lesson today?'

He looked out of his office window as an arctic snow shower blasted
across the 14th green. Few issues currently occupy the Professional
Golfer's Association as intensely as the livelihoods of its 3,500
members. As a result, a PGA working party is radically re-thinking the
raison d'etre of the pro.

It doesn't help that while the public image of the golf professional is
Nick Faldo or Ernie Els, superstars like those are a light year away
from the everyday work of the pro at the local club.

When the PGA wanted a leading figure for a publicity campaign, it found
Faldo's fee unaffordable, so ended up using Nigel Mansell, one of the
game's better-known amateurs.

Alan Walker is a committee member at the PGA and is deeply involved in
the process of reviewing future direction. As one experienced insider
put it: 'We have to stop training people for futures they are never
going to have. They're not going to be Woosnam or Norman, and now
they're not going to be a successful shopkeeper, either.'

Walker acknowledges the problems. 'At the end of the day we're all
failed players,' he says. 'I went into the game thinking I could play
and was going to spend my days on the course winning tournaments, and
I've ended up an accountant.' Later this month the PGA opens an Pounds
8m training academy at its headquarters, The Belfry, the hotel course
in the English Midlands that has hosted several Ryder Cups.

Leisure management and course architecture are much more important now
than learning how to spend several hours repairing a persimmon-headed
driver for a tiny fee.

The qualifications dished out at The Belfry will be equivalent to a
degree. 'We've always been reluctant retailers, and the tour is for a
tiny minority, of whom 75 per cent won't cover their costs,' says
Walker. 'The jobs we've got to aim for are those of actually managing
the facilities, which in the past have gone to food and beverage
specialists or greenkeepers.

'In the future, if your local club pro can't drive a computer and work
the local media, forget admiring his short game around the green.'

If the pro can re-engineer himself to survive, what of the shop? We may
not buy much, but which weekend golfer doesn't enjoy a mooch around his
club shop's over-stocked shelves?

'It's history,' says Colin Hegarty. 'Marks and Spencer are already
moving into clothing in a huge way and the big chains will be selling
all the clubs and equipment. A starter's hut where you can buy a glove
and a ball - if you've forgotten to bring them - is the most likely
outcome.'

ARCHITECTURE:
YEAR OF THE MILLENNIAL RE-THINK

   By COLIN AMERY

At least 1995 ended on a note of pure wisdom. For once, the old English
system of independent representative groups of well-informed
individuals appointed by the crown to guide our affairs worked
brilliantly, with the millennium commissioners proving themselves worth
their salt by refusing to allocate national lottery money for the
proposed Cardiff Bay opera house.

For too long Lord Crickhowell and his opera house trustees have been
led by the nose by London architectural groupies and admirers of the
designs of Zaha Hadid, who won the competition to design the proposed
opera house.

The common sense of the minister, Virginia Bottomley, and her
commissioners will save Wales the embarrassment of a design that is not
supported by the people of Wales and is already dated.

A Cardiff Bay opera house as a new home for the Welsh National Opera is
a good idea, and no doubt a large theatre will be built there. The
mistake was for the opera house trustees to believe they had to build
something approved by a narrow segment of the international
architectural mafia.

The jury for the competition was unrepresentative and innocent,
seemingly prepared to let Miss Hadid's quaintly modern period piece go
ahead even though she had never built a serious building. Miss Hadid is
really a talented futurist painter - her work would have been avant
garde in turn of the century Russia. Today it is labelled
'uncompromising' and 'exciting'. It is neither. The trendy London
chatterers who influence people like Lord Crickhowell should be seen
for what they are: rearguard types trying to protect a briefly
fashionable designer. But Miss Hadid is no genius.

The tragedy of the inevitable row about Cardiff Bay is that the failure
of Miss Hadid's design will be seen as a triumph for the philistines.
It is actually a dated, awkward design that only got this far through
endless lobbying. The millennium commissioners, who distribute part of
the proceeds of the UK national lottery, have called the bluff of the
trendies.

Sensible opera house trustees should look at the newest opera houses in
the world; meet their architects and managers; and choose someone with
experience. The trustees must start again with a good new architect.
Life is tough, but Virginia Bottomley is tougher, and in this case she
and her commissioners are right.

Last year, national lottery money gave a fillip to the UK's
architectural profession. The turnover of the British construction
industry should benefit by some 5 per cent or so in the years to the
millennium. It is large-scale projects that attract attention, but some
90 per cent of lottery grants are for projects of less than Pounds 1m.

Yet 1995 saw construction still in recession and architects only
beginning to see green shoots of recovery fertilised by lottery cash.
The secretary of state for the environment, John Gummer, belatedly
recognised the value of towns. His new planning policy guidance notes,
to be issued early this year, will stress the value of mixed
developments. That is an almost complete volte face for the entire
planning system. If he is serious, Gummer will presumably be
re-educating the entire planning profession at the new University of
Greenwich.

He will have to start with the Corporation of the City of London which,
since the inspired but disastrous experiment of the Barbican, has
abandoned any pretence that the City is more than a Square Mile of
offices. The recent announcement of two big office schemes in EC4, and
the decision to encourage Mitsubishi to go back to the drawing board on
the Paternoster site, means the City may be in danger of becoming a
horizontal version of Canary Wharf.

The opportunity at Paternoster to build a mixed development, giving
Mitsubishi the chance to build as many offices as it likes on, say,
London Wall, must not be missed. In turn, the chance to move the Museum
of London to a marvellous site next to St Paul's should be grasped, and
why not have hotels and residential accommodation overlooking Wren's
wonder?

Architects in 1996 need to learn to be different kinds of animals.
Those like Miss Hadid and Sir Richard Rogers (imminent adviser to the
new Labour party) who are wedded to dogma, are now old fashioned.
Architects like Sir Michael Hopkins, Sir Norman Foster and Richard
MacCormac are the leaders of the profession, and also admired by the
public.

That is a breakthrough, and one that has come about because the public
are under-estimated by architects at their peril. The public - you and
me - understands the difference between quality and a dead cow in
formaldehyde. Virginia Bottomley and her commissioners understand the
difference, too. In 1996, quality and common sense may replace dogma
and fashionable nonsense. I live in hope.

MAN OF MUSIC WITH PERIOD APPEAL - ANDREW CLARK TALKS TO THE CONDUCTOR
WHO CHALLENGES OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND OPENS OUR EARS TO THE PAST

   By ANDREW CLARK

This looks like Roger Norrington's year. He opens and closes it in
Salzburg, conducting the Vienna Philharmonic there later this month and
returning in December to rehearse Mozart's Mitridate for the 1997
festival. In between there will be Berlioz with the London
Philharmonic, Dvorak in Boston, Henze in Basle, Elgar in Washington,
Beethoven in Chicago, Nicholas Maw at the Proms and Brahms in Vienna -
not forgetting three European tours with his own period-instrument
orchestra, the London Classical Players.

Did someone say Norrington was a period specialist? If so, the period
ranges pretty wide - from 1600 to 2000. That distinguishes him from
most early music pioneers. And he uses the same forensic skills to
unravel Vaughan Williams and Part as he does for Beethoven and Bruckner
- which sets him apart from other high-profile conductors. No British
musician has done more to challenge our assumptions or open our ears to
the past. At 61, Roger Norrington fully deserves the international
limelight.

He clearly enjoys it. The early music revolution, he says, is not about
period instruments or a particular type of repertoire. 'It's a habit of
mind. Even if I didn't know anything about early music, I would still
be the conductor I am now. I just can't look at a piece of music
without taking it back into the garage and stripping it down, finding
what the hell is going on and putting it back together again. Vroom]'

Earthy enthusiasm has always been a Norrington hallmark. It inspired
his singers and orchestra at Kent Opera, where his 13 years as music
director gave him a vast repertory and an intimate understanding of how
a company works. Enthusiasm has also been the key to his 'Experience'
weekends, where he and the LCP discuss, rehearse and perform a
composer's work to the amused enlightenment of all. And it continues to
permeate his day-to-day contact with conventional orchestras.

'You don't often come across that kind of enthusiasm for the way the
music is realised,' said a member of the Basle Symphony Orchestra after
Norrington's latest visit. 'His contact with the players is amazingly
lively - the orchestra had a great time. He got a humming performance,
the music really took off.'

Longstanding colleagues say Norrington has mellowed over the years. He
has had two operations for cancer and become a father again: his wife,
the choreographer Kay Lawrence, and their two-year-old son often travel
with him. 'But when it comes to the music, he's just as strict and
demanding as ever,' says an LCP stalwart. 'He has an incontrovertible
idea of how it should be. His point is that this is real music written
by real people, and he gets that 'immediate' element across. He wants
to get round the traditional interpretation, demythologise the music,
remove the waffle and ballast.'

That is one of the reasons why Norrington now enjoys such a high
profile outside the UK. Long popular in the US and Italy, he has only
recently begun to make his presence felt in the Austro-German
heartland. He says CDs have had a proselytising influence - 'they're
sinking into the subconscious. People there are getting used to the
idea that there are things they need to know about. Despite my rough
German, the orchestras have been very responsive.'

Norrington has not forgotten the UK. A former choral scholar at
Cambridge, he lives in Berkshire, organises the LCP's schedule with a
couple of helpers and conducts 10 programmes a year with the London
Philharmonic. He says he is perfectly happy to work with modern
instruments. 'If you're changing the score - because many of the
published scores are inaccurate - and you change the seating, the
tempo, the phrasing, the light and shade, the Weltanschauung, it
already makes a huge difference. But once they get used to the style,
they may hesitantly say 'We're doing everything else, shouldn't we drop
the vibrato?'. That happened with the LPO, and the result was
absolutely marvellous. As they begin to trust you, they realise you're
not going to turn up in a gown and mortar board. They see you're a real
musician.'

Norrington's interest in historically aware performance began in the
early 1960s, when he went round the churches of Europe performing
Schutz with his own amateur choir. There was no Schutz style: he had to
invent his own. From there it was but a short step to Bach, Telemann
and Handel - and on to Gluck and Haydn, Beethoven and Berlioz, Schubert
and Schumann. The journey has now reached Wagner and Bruckner, and the
results astonish Norrington as much as they do his admirers.

In his LCP recording of the Meistersinger overture, Norrington knocks
two to three minutes off the standard performance length. 'I keep
thinking that with the next thing we do, there won't be quite the same
things to discover,' he says. 'A year ago, we didn't know how Wagner
would sound on period instruments. I thought the tempo wouldn't be a
big question, it would be a matter of just hearing the same music on
these instruments. Then I started my research. In Ueber das Dirigieren,
Wagner writes that when he conducted the Meistersinger overture, it
lasted a few seconds over eight minutes. I thought wow] What will it
sound like if we do that?'

It was a revelation - less pompous and more humorous than usual, with a
spring-in-the-step in the climaxes. There were similar results in
Bruckner's Third Symphony, which Norrington conducted at the Linz
Bruckner festival last autumn. He opted for the first version - the one
Bruckner never heard, with none of the 'improvements' carried out by
his pupils for later performing versions. And he delved into Bruckner's
own recorded comments, which include references to a polka in the
finale.

'What do most conductors do? They play it like a dirge. But if Bruckner
says it's a polka, it's a polka. So I take it at a steady polka speed,
which makes it sound like a dance - and the chorale suddenly becomes
singable. All I'm trying to do is put the record straight, to believe
in the past. You don't set out to prove people wrong - you start as an
innocent, asking questions, and you stumble across these glaringly
obvious things.'

Norrington says he deals with every composer's music in the same way:
'I feel it, I get as much information as I can about it, and then I do
it. I want to obey both sides - the heart and the head, they're in
constant creative tension. You can have the best intentions to follow
what the composer wants, but after a couple of days in rehearsal you
may find you're doing it quite differently - and that's how it should
be. In the end, feeling is king. It has to be your own vision.'

For the past two summers he has conducted at the Rossini festival in
Pesaro. Was there much for him to contribute there? 'The management was
keen I should continue de-cloying Rossini - no high notes at the end,
cadenzas as written, decorations with taste, tempi not too slow. He
doesn't need to be livened up, but there's more allure in the phrasing
than he's given credit for. He's usually hijacked into 19th-century
style. But Zelmira was written in 1822. He went to Vienna and met
Beethoven. These are fully classical works, in the sense that Beethoven
is fully classical.'

Norrington's journey into the past is far from finished. He visits
Prague in May to give the first historically aware performances of
Smetana's Ma Vlast. Given the chance, he would also take the LCP to the
Festspielhaus at Bayreuth - 'the right orchestra in the right hall'. He
wants to play Tchaikovsky in St Petersburg, to do an 'Experience'
weekend on Berg, and to conduct Lulu, Les Troyens and Meistersinger in
the opera house. He dreams of reviving the Early Opera Project, with
which he toured Monteverdi's Orfeo in Italy in the 1980s. 'Historical
staging is in the same state as early music was in 1960. The material
is all there. It just needs a mad entrepreneur with the right theatre.'

Norrington admits that much of what he does is guess-work: it is a
hazard of the road he has chosen to take. He may go wildly wrong at
times - that is the result of his risk-taking - but none of his
performances has ever been dull or routine. Long may it stay that way.

TALES FROM ARABIA - THEATRE

   By SIMON READE

There is no better place to tell a spell-binding story than in the
theatre, especially around Christmas, when we are at our most
childlike. This is the motivation behind Battersea Arts Centre's
ambitious current programme 'Telling Tales'. Alongside new Christian
fables and fresh glosses on the European tales of the Brothers Grimm,
it is refreshing to experience the contrasting oral tradition of
Persia: Alf Laylah Wa Laylah - Arabian Nights: The Tales of
Sheherazade.

The excitement starts when you enter the modest studio to find it
re-formed. We sit cross-legged in-the-round, raised above the courtyard
arcade beneath, peering into a shimmering arena which transforms from
king's bedroom to bustling bazaar, the banks of the Nile and the plains
between Cairo and Basra in the tiniest flicker of our mind's eye. 'This
hot land called Egypt' is conjured from nothing more than a fistful of
sand draining through a woman's fingers. Michael Gordon's direction and
Liz Cooke's design create a compelling environment for their dedicated
company of ten focused performers. 'Listen,' they command: 'Listen.'

It is the whim of King Shahrayar to execute his virgin brides after
only one night, as a means of purging his kingdom of unfaithful Woman.
He scapegoats them because of his own self-loathing: he murdered his
first queen in a fit of ill-founded jealousy. A strong-willed princess,
the Sheherazade, is determined to end this needless sacrifice, and
volunteers to be his bride, but only after she has told her sister a
bedtime story - beautifully in Arabic - which intrigues the King. So
she tells him more.

The stories selected by the company are not of the Boys Own 'Ali Baba
and the Forty Thieves' variety, but all craftily develop the
proto-feminist theme. Each tale has jealous husbands wrongfully
murdering their wives for imagined infidelity, or women enduring sex
and childbirth, and even broach pre-ordained marriage. This
interpretation of the exotic Arabic world of the Middle Ages as one
riddled with miscarriages of natural justice against women, pursues a
clear agenda, but not one which is worn on the sumptuous sleeves of the
women. The stories are elliptical, graceful and enchanting.

There are stories within stories, tales chasing their own tales, richly
interwoven like a magic carpet. The 75 minutes of storytelling does not
only reinvigorate a moribund king, but revivifies the wider audience.
Suitable for older children, it could run for 1001 nights.

At the BAC, London until January 7 (0171-223 2223).

TODAY'S TELEVISION

   By MARTIN HOYLE

Local heroes (7.30pm BBC2) is a little hymn to English eccentricity,
both in style and content. Adam Hart-Davies is a one-man store of
trivia (or general knowledge as it used to be called in less ruthlessly
mercenary days) about inventions of the past including laughing-gas (I
always thought invented by Humphry Davy out of sheer boredom with
Bristol; eminently likely) and a spanking-machine.

For those who remember Richard Harris' play Outside Edge, first on
stage then on television with the incomparable Maureen Lipman, the
sitcom with the same name has been something of a disappointment. Its
characters verge on the caricatured and lack that consistency that even
sitcom creations should have. Still, a show that avoids aping American
comedy and even takes cricket as its theme is worth a plaudatory
chuckle (8.30pm ITV).

Great Ormond Street continues its gripping survey of the great
children's hospital (8pm BBC1); and Wild Britain (8pm C4) is a repeat
about the bramble bush and its dependent wildlife.

AN ABSENCE OF INFLATION: THE FEELGOOD FACTOR IS SET TO REMAIN ELUSIVE
IN 1996

   By MARTIN WEALE and GARRY YOUNG

By most measures, 1995 was a good year for the UK economy. Inflation
remained subdued, output grew by more than 2.5 per cent, unemployment
declined by more than 200,000 and government borrowing fell, albeit by
less than was expected at the beginning of the year. In addition, Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was able to take a penny off the basic
rate of income tax and cut interest rates by a quarter of 1 percentage
point.

This very favourable mix of growth and inflation is rare by British
historical standards and, while we think it likely to continue, there
are risks that the economy will not be as successful in 1996.

The most striking aspect of the present economic situation is the
virtual absence of domestically generated inflation at a time of
relatively fast growth and falling unemployment. This is partly a
reflection of the extent of disinflationary pressure in the UK labour
market. Since the peak in unemployment in 1993, wage increases have
shown no sign of picking up and real wages have scarcely grown. This
means that the benefits of increased productivity have been
appropriated into profit margins. These have risen substantially:
profits as a proportion of gross domestic product - at 36 per cent in
1994 - are higher than in the early 1970s.

One important question in present circumstances is whether the
surprising lack of growth in wage rates is evidence - as claimed by the
Treasury - that the sustainable rate of unemployment has fallen. In the
1980s and early 1990s it seemed that this figure was about 8 per cent
of the labour force. Certainly, when the unemployment rate fell to 5.5
per cent by 1990, there was a sharp acceleration in inflation which was
only squeezed out by the rise in unemployment during the last
recession.

Assuming productivity growth of 2 per cent a year, the rate of increase
in wages could probably rise from its existing level of 3.25 per cent
to 4.5 per cent per annum and still be consistent with annual inflation
of 2.5 per cent and very high profit margins. This suggests that
unemployment at 8 per cent is still above its sustainable rate.

It would be premature, however, to assume from this that the
sustainable rate of unemployment has indeed fallen. Unit labour costs
picked up noticeably in 1995 and in manufacturing were growing in
October at an annual rate of 4 per cent. This probably reflects the
stagnation of productivity associated with the slowdown in output. But
it may be an early indication that unemployment is reaching its
sustainable level.

If the sustainable unemployment rate has fallen, it will be possible
for output to grow for some time to come at more than its underlying
trend rate without generating inflationary pressure. This does not
guarantee that the chancellor's inflation target of 2.5 per cent by the
end of the present parliament will be met - the weakness of domestic
prices has been offset by increases in import prices arising from
sterling's depreciation of close to 7 per cent through 1995.

We expect the underlying inflation rate by the end of 1996 to be
slightly over 3 per cent. A better way of putting this is to say that
we think there is only a 40 per cent chance of meeting the inflation
target. There is also a risk that inflation will be substantially
higher if faster growth in import prices feeds through to domestic
prices.

This assessment depends on the outlook for demand, which appears to
have stalled in the second half of 1995, leading to fears that the
overall rate of growth in 1996 will be considerably slower. This time
last year the National Institute forecast growth of 2.7 per cent for
1995, and this is likely to be very close to the eventual out-turn. For
1996, we are predicting growth of 2.4 per cent, much lower than the
Treasury's forecast of 3 per cent.

Our forecast assumes that continued weakness in domestic demand will be
offset by higher export demand, helped by the fall in sterling in 1995.
Individual monthly figures are erratic, but it was gratifying to see
higher exports in November as an early indication of this trend.

We do not expect much of a feelgood factor to develop in 1996. This is
partly due to the very slow growth in wages.

There is at present much discussion about whether the economy will be
lifted by a surge in consumer spending, with the suggestion that
spending is depressed by consumer gloom inspired by fears about
employment prospects. But the truth is that consumers are behaving
perfectly normally. It looks as though they will have saved about 9 per
cent of their income in 1995 and we are expecting a similar figure for
1996. This is lower than in any year since 1971, except during the boom
period of 1986 to 1990 - and we doubt consumers are ready for a binge
like that of the late 1980s.

In spite of the pause in growth, we expect a continuing fall in
claimant unemployment to about 1.9m, or just under 7 per cent of the
labour force. This is partly due to changes in the administration of
benefits. While we expect some acceleration in wage growth, this will
be consistent with a downwards drift in the inflation rate as the rate
of increase in import prices subsides. Profit margins will stop rising,
but there will be no great pressure on them.

The main risk of this forecast is that demand will be weaker than
expected as a consequence of companies adjusting to an unintended
build-up of stocks, tight fiscal policy and possible weakness in demand
for British exports. In this event, inflationary pressure should weaken
further and we would expect to see cuts in interest rates to maintain
the economy's momentum as the next general election approaches.

In the longer term, we expect these favourable trends to continue. The
improved picture in the labour market will be backed up by slightly
faster productivity growth as the economy starts to benefit from the
recent expansion of higher education and, we hope, the more stable
macroeconomic environment established since sterling left the European
exchange rate mechanism. We can see the growth rate accelerating to 2.8
per cent and unemployment falling to 1.2m. This would not exactly be an
economic miracle, but it would at least make a pleasant change from the
years of stop-go.

Martin Weale is director of the National Institute of Economic and
Social Research, a UK research institute, and a member of the
Treasury's panel of independent economic forecasters. Garry Young is a
research fellow at the institute.

NEITHER BOOM NOR BUST: CONDITIONS ARE NOT RIGHT FOR SHARPLY LOWER US
INTEREST RATES

   By STEPHEN S. ROACH

The financial markets always want more of a good thing. And that seems
to be the case in looking to 1996. It is fashionable to worry that the
US economy is soft and getting softer, and that inflation is heading
dramatically lower. In such an environment, the Federal Reserve is
expected to reduce short-term interest rates aggressively. Moreover,
with the budget deal of a lifetime finally thought to be at hand, most
forecasters expect a dramatic further rally in the bond market.
Needless to say, such a scenario hardly poses a threat to the glorious
bull market of 1995.

Our prognosis for the US economy in 1996 is at odds with many of these
presumptions. I expect neither a boom nor a bust. Real gross domestic
product is likely to expand in a 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent range -
essentially in line with what I believe to be the US economy's
underlying long-term growth potential. The case for upside growth
surprises is relatively straightforward. It is based on solid support
from three important macroeconomic forces: real income generation (at
present running above trend at 3.7 per cent); interest rates (which are
near historic lows); and the currency (which is vastly undervalued).

In such a constructive environment, I expect the US economy to show
surprisingly broad-based gains in 1996. With mortgage interest rates
down about 200 basis points over the past year, the turnround in the
residential construction sector should continue well into the new year.
And there should be no let-up in US business's record-setting boom in
capital spending.

This is a structural phenomenon - triggered mainly by spectacular
productivity breakthroughs - that should continue to be surprisingly
immune to the whims of the business cycle.

Upside surprises in the export sector can also be expected, reflecting
the combined effects of a supercompetitive US economy and more diverse
trade flows. The strong impetus for export growth in 1995 - with unit
volume growth accelerating from 4.8 per cent in the first quarter to
10.6 per cent in the third - stands in sharp contrast to widespread
fears that there will be an export collapse in a sluggish global
economy.

The good news is that the US is less dependent on its traditional
trading partners: sales to Europe and Japan have fallen to 34 per cent
of overall US exports, down sharply from 42 per cent at the end of
1990.

Finally, reports of the demise of the American consumer are vastly
exaggerated. With consumption well supported by income generation, I do
not share the widespread conviction that households are being dragged
down by excess debts. The ratio of annual debt servicing expenses to
income stands at present at 16.8 per cent, well below the highs hit in
the latter half of the 1980s. While I do not expect a consumer buying
binge, the forecast of 2.5 per cent growth in real consumption through
1996 is sufficient to account for over 1.5 percentage points of real
GDP growth.

The inflation prognosis is particularly intriguing. While I continue to
believe the cost-efficient, productivity-led US recovery remains
intact, I am now of the view that the inflation rate is slowly moving
up from its cyclical lows. The consumer price index rose 2.9 per cent
in 1995, up 0.3 percentage points from the low of 1994, and a little
more acceleration in 1996 is expected, to an annual rate of 3.2 per
cent.

I do not share the view that price stability is now at hand. The bulk
of the disinflation of the 1990s has been a by-product of an
extraordinary compression of labour costs. With productivity and
corporate profitability surging, with the unemployment rate at 5.6 per
cent, and with real compensation virtually stagnant for over a decade,
I do not accept the notion that a submissive workforce has no choice
but to capitulate further on wages.

In spite of the supposed threat of the dollar-a-day Chinese worker,
this strain of productivity enhancement has now gone far enough. The
days of asking the labour force to keep sacrificing for the noble cause
of disinflation appear to be largely over. The risk of a backlash from
workers is a growing concern - one that might have an important impact
on the sociology, politics and economics of the US for years to come.

As for the Fed, it is hard to accept the widespread conviction than an
aggressive monetary easing is now at hand.

Given the outlook for the economy and inflation, the urgency for a
further dramatic easing just is not there. Granted, the central bank
may offer a token easing in the aftermath of a budget accord. But if
market expectations of sharply lower short-term interest rates were
realised, the Fed would have to throw its traditional caution to the
wind. If it takes its commitment to price stability seriously, and I
believe it does, it is difficult to imagine the Fed turning away from
the restrictive policy bias that worked so well in the 1980s.

The budget is obviously the wild card. The problem is that it is still
business as usual in Washington. The best we are likely to see is a
plan based on back-loaded spending cuts, front-loaded tax cuts,
immunity for social security and dubious economic assumptions (for
example, that the perfect path of trend growth, low inflation and
declining interest rates continues forever). I have come to the
reluctant conclusion that the same creative mathematicians who gave us
Gramm-Rudman I and II and the great budget accord of 1990 are hard at
work today. Credible deficit reduction remains a dream, not a
certainty.

Adding it all up, it is hard to be thrilled about US Treasury bonds.
Everything good is just about priced into the market. On the chance
that a budget deal is struck - even if it is a classic smoke-and-
mirrors compromise - a final bull run to bond yields of 5 1/2 per cent
is possible.

But as reality sinks in, and the economy and inflation fail to conform
to market hopes, I continue to believe that the next big move in bonds
is back towards an equilibrium level of 7 per cent. I expect such a
correction to take place by mid-year, at the latest.

WAYS TO VIEW SUPPORT FOR STEELMAKING PLANT


Sir, In the US we have been reading with interest the reports that
British Steel is seeking to close an Irish steel plant on account of
subsidies that the Irish government is to provide.

In the US British Steel is seeking one of the biggest subsidies from
the taxpayer ever recorded in order to operate a steel plant in
Alabama, which British Steel is proposing to build in partnership with
an American and a Japanese company.

Support worth Dollars 250m is being sought from - and granted by - the
state legislature of Alabama in order to persuade British Steel and its
two partners to open the steel plant in the state. If built, the plant
will directly threaten the jobs of at least 3,500 steelworkers in other
parts of the country.

Without entering into the merits of the Irish steel plant's case, we
find it puzzling that British Steel is so hostile to subsidies in
Europe and so ravenous for them in the US.

Transatlantic trade and co-operation can not be built on this kind of
tilted playing field.

CANADIAN PEOPLE CAUGHT IN THE TRAPPER'S SNARE


Sir, Thank you for Bernard Simon's comprehensive article ('Hunting for
a kinder kill', December 13). The trap research compound near
Vegreville is a ploy that illustrates how far the Canadian government
and the fur industry will go to preserve this barbaric industry.

The fur industry professes to champion Canadian native people, but it
has been the most destructive force in their history. It has exploited
them, their culture and their way of life. Native people do not
process, sell or store furs but are at the bottom of the fur industry
chain.

Because of the sympathy people feel towards the plight of the Canadian
native people, the Canadian government and the fur industry are
promoting the myth that trapping is culturally and economically central
to the native people.

Fewer than 50 per cent of native homes are fully serviced with sewerage
and water, native infant mortality is 60 per cent higher than the
average among other Canadians, and 70 per cent of natives have not had
a high school education.

Fur trapping has not and will not relieve these problems. It will
perpetuate them.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR:
DIAGNOSING MIDDLE-CLASS ANGST


Sir, In his otherwise excellent article on middle-class insecurity
('Bang go the great expectations', December 27), John Plender is surely
incorrect in claiming that an occupational pension is 'not an asset at
all'.

For the great majority of members of occupational pension schemes, the
pension is tied to the salary earned during the years immediately prior
to retirement and is unaffected by whether or not the company pays its
full contribution in every year.

It is certainly true that the benefits could be improved were
pension-fund surpluses to be used for that purpose, but the basic
payment is secure and does indeed form a substantial asset for the
pensioner.

The whole point about personal pensions, which yield direct ownership
rights, is that whereas the benefits are not tied to salary, and may be
much greater than under an occupational scheme, the risk element is
also much greater and hence the pensioner cannot rely upon the size of
the asset.

It is most unlikely that members of occupational pension schemes are
overly concerned about being 'disenfranchised', although they most
certainly detest those 'bosses' who manipulate their own pensions for
personal advantage.

Insofar that 'frustrated expectations' are the cause of 'middle-class
angst', it is not negative equity which is of direct concern since, as
John Plender notes, this has affected relatively few middle-class
households, but rather the possibility of falling house prices.

This is a very new phenomenon, and often accompanied by great
difficulty in achieving a sale, but it has no parallel in respect of
occupational pensions since their value is unknown prior to retirement.

OBSTACLES FACING THE SPREAD OF DEMOCRACY


Sir, Martin Wolf's piece on whether democracies are growing in number
and influence, and to what extent democracies are less warlike than
autocracies ('Mightier than the sword', December 28) reminds me of
discussions 30 years ago on whether history moves inexorably in the
direction of communism, and to what extent communist governments would
decrease international tensions.

There are indeed powerful 'forces that are driving countries towards
representative political institutions', but there are equally powerful
forces undermining democracies from within. Democracies have been voted
out, and there is no evidence that the increasing gap between rich and
poor will not weaken many democracies.

It is curious that Protestant societies were the first to nourish
democratic institutions, and that no non-Protestant society has
sustained democracy for longer than 70 years. There is nothing
automatic about progress, and nothing inexorable about the direction in
which history will go: that will depend on the choices each of us
makes.

LEADING ARTICLE:
WHEN POLITICS REPLACES POLICY


Britain's general election campaign is under way in earnest. The
defection from the Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats of Miss Emma
Nicholson could not have been a more potent reminder of the fragility
of Mr John Major's government. The prime minister's parliamentary
majority is now down, in effect, to three. Further deaths or defections
could soon eliminate it entirely.

Mr Major appears determined to defer the election until the last
possible date in the spring of 1997, relying if necessary on the
support of the Ulster Unionists to sustain him in any vote of
confidence. Privately, opposition leaders admit that he may well
succeed in that objective. But, amid rumours of further defections,
ministers equally are obliged to acknowledge they can no longer be
certain of the parliamentary arithmetic. An autumn election is now a
real possibility if not yet a probability.

The prime minister would be wise to pay close attention to the message
of Miss Nicholson's defection. Since his leadership victory last
summer, Mr Major has been too anxious to appease his opponents by
speaking the language of the Eurosceptic right of the Tory party.
Whatever her personal motives for joining Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal
Democrats, Miss Nicholson's charge that the government has been
deserting the political centre ground finds a dangerous echo among
voters.

Rhetoric calculated to appeal to the more hardline Conservative
activists will not recover for Mr Major the support of the less
committed voters who will decide the outcome of the election. Mr Blair
has learned one of the golden rules of British politics - elections are
not won from the extremes of left or right but from the centre.

Gruelling business

Either way, the looming campaign promises to be a gruelling and
unedifying business. Politics, it seems, leaves little room these days
for policy. The normal business of government has been suspended. Mr
Major's legislative programme is designed above all to minimise
controversy within his own party and to highlight areas of difference
with Labour. Mr Tony Blair meanwhile concentrates on inflicting
tactical defeats on the government at Westminster. Those expecting
Labour to unfold a detailed blueprint for government are likely to be
disappointed.

As they make their promises and level their charges in the scramble for
votes, however, Messrs Major, Blair and Ashdown should pause for a
moment to reflect on a more worrying feature of British political life.
Politicians of all parties have rarely been held in lower public
esteem. They have themselves, mostly, to blame.

Wider developments

It is true that wider developments have contributed to a general
weakening of faith in the ability of politicians to 'solve' national
problems. Global markets have delineated more clearly the limits of
economic independence. The necessary sharing of sovereignty in Europe
has robbed Westminster of other pretensions. But to acknowledge such
trends is not to exonerate the politicians.

The important gap is not that between the limits imposed by the harsh
realities of modern life and the unreasonable demands of the voters.
The real disillusion stems from the gulf between promises and
performance. If politicians more readily acknowledged the constraints,
the voters would be more willing to adjust their expectations. Instead,
the parties wittingly exaggerate their power, promising easy solutions
to complex problems.

To take the most obvious example: the central debate about the right
levels of public spending and taxation is conducted with shameless
mendacity. One side promises painless tax cuts, the other perfect
public services. The reality is that modest rates of economic growth
will allow neither for the constant ratcheting down of income tax rates
promised by Mr Major nor the cost-free and comprehensive welfare state
pledged by Mr Blair.

It is perhaps too much to expect the politicians to mend their ways so
close to an election. But this erosion of trust and confidence in
parliament is inimical to good government and dangerously corrosive of
democracy. Ultimately, the politicians as well as the voters will be
the losers.

LEADING ARTICLE:
ITALY AND THE EU PRESIDENCY


For the fourth time in a row, the six months' presidency of the
European Union has fallen to a member state whose government is
severely distracted by domestic difficulties. It seems to be becoming a
bad habit. First there was Germany, with a general election in
mid-presidency back in 1994. Then there was France, with presidential
elections last May. The Spanish government in the past six months
managed to postpone its demise in order to complete its EU
chairmanship, in spite of losing its parliamentary majority.

Now Italy is supposed to take the chair, not even sure if it has a
government. Mr Lamberto Dini offered his resignation on Saturday after
completing his limited mandate. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro wants
him to stay on, but he is leaving it to the fractious Italian
parliament to decide. It hardly makes for firm leadership and a clear
agenda for Europe.

Those four Euro-enthusiastic governments were supposed to co-ordinate
their plans for the two-year period. They intended to lay the
groundwork for a clear-sighted and coherent inter-governmental
conference this year, which would mark another important step towards
the goal of European political union. Instead, the EU is stumbling
towards that target in a familiar state of muddle.

Spanish achievements

Admittedly, Mr Felipe Gonzalez's government in Spain achieved rather
more in the past six months than one might have expected from its
political weakness at home. It completed preparations for the IGC,
albeit with more modest ambitions than committed integrationists would
like. It persuaded the other 14 member states to agree a blueprint for
the launch of the single currency in 1999. It finalised a programme to
reinforce the fragile relationship between the EU and US. And it
organised an impressive gathering of Mediterranean states to cement
better co-operation between Europe, the middle east and north Africa.
Not bad for a lame-duck administration.

The challenge for Mr Dini, or any other head of an Italian government,
is to keep that good work going. At least he does not appear
over-ambitious. Italy has not tabled any heavy agenda of national
priorities, as other member states are sometimes tempted to do. A
successful launch to the IGC at the end of March is one priority;
agreement on a reconstruction plan for Bosnia is another. The former
should be a formality, but the latter could be a very difficult
negotiation: the European Union must be generous if it wants the peace
initiative in Bosnia to succeed, but every member state faces tough
domestic budget constraints, limiting the room for manoeuvre.

Difficult issues

There are always other difficult issues on the EU agenda which require
clear leadership from the presidency. In the next six months those
include the plans to liberalise the EU energy market; reform of the
Tacis aid programme for countries of the former Soviet Union; and
reform of the EU wine market. There is also strong German pressure for
agreement on a stabilisation package to regulate the behaviour of
member states after creation of economic and monetary union. These are
all issues on which Italy has clear national interests, and on which a
weak government in Rome may find it difficult to compromise, let alone
negotiate a deal.

A strong Italian government is out of the question for the foreseeable
future. At this moment, early elections would not solve the problem:
under the present electoral laws, they are unlikely to produce a result
much different from the present stalemate. President Scalfaro is right
to urge the main political factions to stop bickering and agree on a
programme of essential constitutional reforms. That could be enacted by
a broad-based cross-party coalition, as Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the
former prime minister, appears to favour - though this seems somewhat
unrealistic.

Alternatively, Mr Dini could be asked to serve on for another six
months, dedicated to the EU presidency and to securing the
constitutional reforms. That would be an acceptable compromise, in the
interests of Italy and Europe.

EUROPE UNLOCKED FOR DEALERS: ON THE FIRST DAY OF TRADING UNDER NEW
RULES BREAKING DOWN EU BORDERS, JOHN GAPPER AND RICHARD LAPPER ASSESS
WHO THE WINNERS AND LOSERS WILL BE

   By JOHN GAPPER and RICHARD LAPPER

This morning NatWest Securities will commence trading on the Swedish
Stock Exchange from its offices in the City of London. For the first
time, the stockbroking arm of the British bank will buy and sell shares
in Swedish companies without having to do so through local brokers. 'We
can sit in London with a screen on our desks, and trade as if we were
in Stockholm,' says Mr Scott Dobbie, chairman of NatWest Securities.

The ability to trade securities across borders in this way is a product
of the European Union's Investment Services Directive (ISD), which
takes effect today. The directive aims to give Europe's thousands of
broking firms a 'passport' to trade anywhere in the Union, and is
accompanied by the Capital Adequacy Directive (CAD) which imposes fresh
capital requirements.

Progress in implementing the two directives is likely to be slow - by
December 31, only seven of the 15 EU states had passed the necessary
legislation. But whatever the delays, the changes are happening faster
than previous efforts to harmonise banking supervision. 'It is far more
complex, and it is having to be accomplished in a much shorter time,'
says Ms Jane Welch, head of legal advice at the UK Securities and
Investments Board.

And the impact on Europe's stock exchanges and derivatives markets will
be far-reaching. The directives are likely to favour larger investment
banks and stock exchanges, at the expense of smaller firms and
exchanges.

There are two key measures in the Investment Services Directive. The
first is that firms will be able to operate in any EU member state,
provided they are regulated in one of them. When operating outside
their home countries, they will be subject to rules on the conduct of
business devised by the local regulators for all banks and brokers.

For the larger banks already operating in more than one EU country, the
'passport' rule will reduce costs and ease the regulatory burden.
However, the directive is unlikely to make a significant difference to
their operations. Although there have been instances of member states
imposing strict requirements on foreign banks, most of them have been
able to operate where they want. 'We have never felt constrained about
crossing national borders,' says Mr Wilco Jiskoot, senior executive
vice-president for merchant banking at ABN Amro, the Dutch bank.

But for smaller firms operating in countries with no regulation for
securities traders, the directive will mean being regulated for the
first time - together with the accompanying costs, even if they are
operating purely in their domestic markets. They are also likely to
lose the share of commission and fees they make in carrying out local
business for large investment banks. From today smaller brokers will
have to find a substitute for such earnings if they are to survive.

The second key measure of the directive is to allow stock exchanges and
futures and options markets to trade throughout the EU. With increasing
volumes of equity dealing, derivatives business and bond market
transactions carried out electronically, this should in effect allow
brokers to conduct business from offices located anywhere in Europe.

The effect will be to increase competition between Europe's 32
securities exchanges and 24 derivatives markets. Already, for example,
the Deutsche Borse, which runs the German stock and derivatives
markets, plans to extend its electronic network to several other
countries. Early this year it is opening an access point in London,
which will reduce the telecommunications costs for London-based
Deutsche Bo rse members to transact their business directly with
Frankfurt.

It is widely expected that many smaller exchanges could fold as these
pressures intensify. Mr Gerard Pfauwadel, chairman of the Matif, the
Paris-based futures market, expects a wave of restructuring with some
derivatives markets disappearing, either through merger or takeover.
'It will mean some substantial modification in the landscape of futures
and options exchanges in Europe,' he says.

Matif is planning to launch an ambitious joint electronic network with
the Deutsche Borse and two other French exchanges later this year which
would allow traders to deal in French and German equities over the same
screens. It would also cover a range of futures and options products.
'With the prospect of a single currency it all amounts to a new big
bang in Europe as far as the markets are concerned,' says Mr Pfauwadel.

One target for European exchanges such as Paris and Frankfurt is likely
to be the London Stock Exchange's Seaq-I electronic bulletin board,
which marketmakers use to advertise large blocks of European shares for
purchase and sale. Already, European bourses which have invested a
large amount on modernising their trading and settlement systems have
won back dealing business in local equities from Seaq-I.

But many market participants argue that large exchanges - particularly
London - are likely to gain rather than lose from the directive.
NatWest's strategy of trading increasingly on local exchanges rather
than on Seaq-I does not lessen its commitment to its main base in
London. Remote trading on overseas exchanges could help London's role
as the physical location from which traders operate by electronic
means.

Mr Giles Vardey, director of markets development at the London Stock
Exchange, argues that remote trading is now 'commercially inevitable'.
Mr Vardey accepts that competition from large exchanges will intensify,
but says smaller exchanges could suffer. 'Trading power is likely to
become concentrated in London, and the directive will hasten this
process,' he says.

The most immediate effects of Capital Adequacy Directive are likely to
be felt by the investment banks. They will be required for the first
time to allocate capital to cover risks of losses through adverse
movements in the markets for shares, bonds or currencies. At the
moment, banks have to allocate capital only to cover lending risks
under the 1988 Basle accord of international supervisors.

The new rules also demand that banks and securities firms monitor their
risks at all times keeping a permanent watch on large exposures. For
example, trading exposures to a single customer will have to be limited
in most cases to less than 25 per cent of capital base - and can only
be exceeded with the national regulator's permission. The larger banks
are best placed to comply with such demands, having invested huge
amounts over the past few years in systems to allow them to monitor
their exposure.

Smaller banks are less prepared. 'Developing the ability to spot large
exposures across the business is a significant headache for many
players,' says Mr Arun Aggarwal, partner in treasury and capital
markets at Price Waterhouse, the accountants. 'It imposes a level of
integration that only the top few players have.'

In theory, the Capital Adequacy Directive could lead to some banks
having to set aside significantly more capital. But most banks believe
that the directive's impact will be minimal. Mr Ian Linnell, banking
analyst at Standard & Poor's, the credit rating agency, says for most
the impact has been 'neutral to marginal', and believes that some banks
will be able to operate with less capital than before.

However, there could be extra burdens for those banks which are heavily
involved in equities trading, for which Capital Adequacy Directive
rules are stiffer in some cases. For example, BZW, the investment
banking arm of Barclays, will have to put aside a little more capital,
according to Mr David Band, chief executive.

But the biggest impact so far has arisen from the need to invest in
upgrading technology to comply with the directive's requirements to
monitor group operations globally. Some of the bigger banks have spent
up to Pounds 5m on systems and software, and even the smaller firms
face minimum costs of Pounds 50,000 to pay for software. Mr Band says
there has been a shortage of technicians in London able to work on bank
systems. 'That has been a big problem for the market,' he says.

As the directives come into action this morning, the immediate
beneficiaries look to be the large investors who increasingly trade
across European borders and are likely to see a reduction in charges.
In the longer term, the winners will be the large investment banks,
many of which are now based in London. The losers will be the smaller,
less efficient brokers and the smaller exchanges that cannot find a
role as the EU's stock and derivatives markets become increasingly
integrated.

OBSERVER: NATWEST SEEKS TOP GUN


What will the NatWest Group do with Dollars 3.6bn that it is raising
from the sale of its US retail banking business to Fleet Financial? Not
so long ago NatWest was the biggest of the Big Four UK banks. Now it is
the smallest. So the money should come in handy helping fulfil its
ambition to transform NatWest Markets into one of the top 10 global
investment banks.

Although NatWest appears to have ruled out bidding for a well-known
Wall Street name, like Lehman Brothers, it will have to buy something,
or someone, if it wants to be a serious player in the big league. In
October it paid a hefty Dollars 135m for Eric Gleacher's five-year-old
US mergers and acquisition boutique. Gleacher, 55, made his name
running Morgan Stanley's M&A department during some of the biggest
hostile takeover battles in the 1980s. Now he has made his fortune by
selling out to NatWest.

As long as Gleacher hangs around, NatWest Markets has a chance of being
taken seriously in the domestic US investment banking market. However,
Gleacher is not an international player and NatWest Markets desperately
needs to beef up its global investment banking team if it wants to
compete with Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley etc.

Hence the owners of some European corporate finance boutiques must be
hoping that NatWest will be as generous to them as it was to Gleacher.
After all, when Morgan Grenfell was looking for a new chief executive
in 1987, it had to pay Pounds 15m for John Craven's Phoenix Securities
to secure Craven's services.

The obvious UK candidate is Hambro Magan's George Magan who worked for
Morgan Grenfell before starting his own boutique in 1988. He is a good
five years younger than Gleacher and has an equally impressive record
in the UK M&A market. But would Magan join NatWest Markets for less
than Gleacher?

Surely not. Once again NatWest may have to make do with second best.

The only thing that the exhibits have in common is that they can no

HONOUR GUARD


Another New Year's honour's list has come and gone and dear old Andrew
Buxton, Barclays' chairman, has still not picked up his knighthood.

There are lots of other good guys, such as the chief executives of
Shell and SmithKline Beecham, who have not got their Ks. But Buxton is
different. He is a chairman of one of the top dozen companies in the UK
and all his fellow chairman have titles. What has he done wrong?

Whether Buxton deserves a knighthood after 33 years with Barclays is
neither here nor there. But the latest honours list just goes to show
how little progress has been made in tidying up the present system of
honours for business folk.

Peter Wood, who created Direct Line, gets a CBE, whereas Graham
Kirkham, a fellow entrepreneur, gets a knighthood. Alan Jackson, the
departing chief executive of BTR, gets nothing. But Malcolm McIntosh, a
fellow Australian, gets his K for keeping down the cost of the Ministry
of Defence's weapons bill.

One can only hope that the leaders of big business who have not got
titles turned them down. But one suspects not.

Great idea. The snag is that South Africa's hijackers already use the

READY FOR CROSS-BORDER REFORM

   By ANDREW JACK, ANDREW FISHER, ANDREW HILL and EMMA TUCKER

   PARIS, FRANKFURT, MILAN, BRUSSELS


Only seven of the European Union's 15 member states were ready to
implement the Investment Services Directive when it came into effect
yesterday, the European federation of stock markets reported.

The directive is designed to allow non-bank investment groups to carry
out several activities more easily across borders.

It aims to create a 'passport' system allowing an institution regulated
in one EU country to operate in all the others without having to comply
with additional requirements.

Stock market officials in some countries say they have restructured and
are ready to meet the requirements of the directive but their
governments have not yet passed the necessary legislation. Other
governments have expressed concern about accepting the 'passport'.

Market officials say the seven which have to all intents and purposes
met the requirements of the directive on time are the UK, the Republic
of Ireland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Luxembourg and Belgium.
In some of these, however, the legislation itself still needs to be
passed. Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and France are expected to
introduce the legislation by the middle of this year. Germany, Greece
and Spain will not be prepared for full implementation until 1997.

Some countries such as France and Italy have used the enabling
legislation for the directive to push through broader financial
regulatory reforms, which has held up progress.

There are already strong links between the Frankfurt and Paris
derivatives markets which are expected to deepen in the coming months,
but the directive should extend links throughout Europe.

In Germany, this will create considerable new work for the Federal
Supervisory office for Securities Trading (BAWe), which was set up only
a year ago to root out insider traders and enforce compliance with
stricter disclosure requirements. Analysts believe the main effect of
the directive may be less to encourage financial institutions to open
offices in other countries than to change the location of where
transactions are carried out - reinforcing the position of those
markets which already have the greatest liquidity for any particular
security.

Mr Giuseppe Zadra, director general of the Italian banking association,
said he feared the focus of trading in Italian instruments could shift
to other markets if his country's institutions did not invest and
modernise. 'National markets don't have a future, and that's why they
will have to be changed and compete on a European scale,' he said.

The new rules have also raised fears there will be new risks for
investors because institutions receiving their passport in the country
with the weakest regulatory requirements will be able to obtain
recognition elsewhere.

'I have already heard anecdotally that some dubious firms from outside
Europe are looking for the best place to get initial authorisation,'
said one stock market official. 'The strength of the whole will rely on
the standards imposed by the least experienced regulator.'

THE LEX COLUMN:
GOING FOR GROWTH


It is perfectly reasonable to feel sanguine about the prospects for the
world's main financial markets in 1996, but it is difficult to get
excited. Inflation is low and apparently under control; growth may have
slowed, but most economies will still expand this year; and the US
economy's soft landing looks convincing enough.

But after last year's bull run, there is much less to go for. In 1995,
inflation fears proved overdone, allowing interest rates to be cut. The
resulting bond market rally, coupled with bid activity, fuelled
advances in stock prices.

Even though there are more interest rate cuts to come, the pace is
slowing and much of the benefit is already priced into both bonds and
stocks. Furthermore, the US market, which led the way last year, looks
rather overvalued. The stock market, having risen more than 30 per cent
last year, faces a proliferation of earnings downgrades. Since earnings
are not likely to fall off a cliff, a slowdown in economic growth does
not necessarily mean stock prices will stall. But the market looks
expensive relative to trend earnings and bond yields. Dividend yields
are low, even when share buy-back programmes are taken into account.
The benign economic environment probably rules out a 1987- style crash,
but a correction is not only likely, it would probably be beneficial.
And there are several potential triggers: the US budget agreement, for
example, has still to be thrashed out.

EUROPE


A correction in the US would hit the UK hardest, since it has benefited
most from the bull run. Although strong earnings growth is likely to
continue into 1997, the UK has other problems, including the growing
possibility of an early election, as the Conservative party's majority
dwindles. In fact, Prime Minister John Major is likely to hold on to
power until 1997 even without a majority, but any weakening of his
control over the election's timing will be viewed as a negative by the
stock market.

The UK also has more to fear from inflation than most other markets,
given its relatively rapid economic growth and an expected rise in
consumer spending. This will benefit some sectors, such as
housebuilding and retailing, but the danger is that any further rate
cuts in the first half of the year will have to be reversed in the
second - or worse that the government may try to ignore overheating of
the economy, since raising rates in the run-up to the election would
hardly be politically expedient. With gilts currently yielding twice as
much as equities, the balance looks about right. But inflation jitters
could cap gilt prices, halting further equity advances.

Further bid activity, as in the US, will help underpin stock market
prices, but estimates that the FT-SE 100 index, whatever early gains it
makes, will end the year around 3,750, less than 100 points above its
current level, are probably sensible.

In continental Europe, the problem is too little growth. This bodes
well for bonds. Even without further short-term rate cuts in Germany,
there is room for bond yields to fall. More generally, any signs that
the structural problems of high social spending and unwieldy budget
deficits are being addressed should encourage investors. Bunds and
other European bond markets may well outperform the US market in 1996 -
the problem is the strongest outperformance is often on the way down,
so it may be safer to bet on yield differentials than on absolute price
movements.

JAPAN


Tokyo's Nikkei-225 has ended the year roughly where it started, just
below 20,000, inviting the question of whether US and European fund
managers are right to increase their weighting in Japan. Few markets
have performed as well over the past six months. The index has gained
37 per cent since its July low, though the yen's decline over that
period has eroded more than half that gain when measured in dollars.
Currency risk will continue to bedevil foreign investors as economic
recovery sucks in more imports, further driving down the trade surplus.
But the attraction of Japan in 1996 is that it is the only leading
market set to benefit both from the early stage of an economic revival
and a pick-up in corporate earnings. A rise in sales should kick in, on
top of the margin improvements achieved over the past year.

On the surface, much of this recovery has already been discounted, with
the index standing at around 83 times prospective earnings - high even
by Japan's historical standards. However, a more useful guide to the
Nikkei's value is the ratio between equity and bond yields. Currently,
Japanese government bonds yield 1.5 times as much as equities, well
below the long-term average. As a result, Japanese institutions, heavy
net sellers of equities last year, may well favour equities over bonds
in 1996. The top Japanese life insurers and brokers have shed recent
pessimism and forecast a 1996 high for the Nikkei in the mid-20,000s.
They may be right.

EMERGING MARKETS


Emerging markets look cheap. On most valuation measures, a rebound is
already overdue. Last year's lacklustre performance partly reflects the
crisis of confidence following the collapse of the Mexican market at
the start of the year. In fact, international investors had little
reason to take the higher risks associated with emerging markets. US
fund managers in particular were able to make impressive returns in
their own domestic market.

But there are signs that US money is starting to move offshore again.
As fund managers are forced to look for growth outside the domestic
market, emerging markets are bound to get at least some of that money.
Typically, US managers have looked south of the border. But there are
still good reasons for avoiding Latin America, not only because of the
dire economic problems which continue to afflict some countries. The
main bond market is the dollar-denominated Brady bond market, which
would suffer from a US market correction. Slow growth, particularly by
emerging markets standards, makes stock markets relatively
unattractive, given the associated currency risk.

Asian stock markets look a better bet. Not only does Asia enjoy strong
economic growth and a cash surplus; the markets are likely to benefit
from funds from Japan, as well as the US and UK.

PENSION FUNDS RAISE RETURNS BUT MISS OUT ON BIG US GAINS

   By GEORGE GRAHAM

UK pension funds recovered from their poor performance in 1994 with
investment returns averaging 19 per cent last year, according to a
survey by the WM Company.

Pension funds benefited from a return of almost 24 per cent on UK
equities, which make up more than half of their portfolios.

But they missed out on the big gains in the US stock market, which
returned 33.8 per cent last year. Only 4.3 per cent of the Pounds 380bn
of funds measured by WM was invested in US equities.

'Everybody thought the US was overpriced at the end of 1994 but it
really took off,' said Mr Peter Warrington, a director of WM, which
specialises in performance measurement.

He added that the longer-term performance of UK pension funds
demonstrated consistently impressive results. Whether measured over
five years or 20 years, they showed the same average annual return of
15.3 per cent, nearly twice the rate of inflation.

'In the mid-1980s, people were saying that equities couldn't go on
producing these high returns. We had disappointing years in 1990 and
1994, but over five years there is still a positive return of 16.7 per
cent on equities,' Mr Warrington said.

Property has proved a more disappointing investment for pension funds.
Although it was the best-performing sector in 1994, in 1995 property
produced a return of only 5.3 per cent, compared with a return for all
other sectors of 20.1 per cent. Over five years, property returns have
averaged 6.0 per cent, and property sank to 5.1 per cent of total
pension fund assets at the end of the year.

WM's survey, which covers about 80 per cent of UK pension funds,
reveals little change in the mix of assets held by managers, despite
widespread discussion of a tendency to 'rebalance' portfolios with more
fixed-income investments and less equity.

Some actuaries and investment managers have argued that pension funds
are maturing, with fewer members now actively contributing and more
receiving benefits. That should mean funds will increase bond holdings
to provide a more guaranteed stream of income.

But the funds measured by WM held 77.5 per cent of their portfolios in
equities last year compared with 76.6 per cent at the end of 1994.
Holdings of UK and overseas bonds, other than index-linked, also
increased, but only to 9.9 per cent.

'All the talk we have heard about funds maturing and moving into bonds
hasn't materialised,' said Mr Warrington.

CHANGES SOUGHT IN TERRORISM INSURANCE FOR CITY

   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent

Reform of the government-backed terrorist insurance scheme, which was
introduced after the 1992 IRA attack on the City, is being urged amid
fears that some companies may be inadequately covered.

The Association of Insurance and Risk Managers is worried that
businesses are having to pay excessively high premium rates, which are
forcing them to make a difficult choice between buying cover or risk
having to bear the cost of a terrorist incident.

Insurance industry estimates suggest that less than half of those
businesses which buy commercial property insurance purchase full
terrorism cover, although many have their own 'captive' insurance
companies providing dedicated insurance cover. Others could cover the
cost of an incident from other resources.

However, Ms Ina Barker, executive director of the association, said:
'The danger is that a lot of big businesses do not have enough
terrorism cover and are therefore putting business at risk.' Such fears
could intensify if the IRA ceasefire broke down.

Airmic hopes to hold talks with the Department of Trade and Industry
about possible reform to Pool Re, the state-backed mutual reinsurance
company. This was set up in 1993 to ensure that conventional insurance
companies could provide terrorism cover to commercial clients.

Pool Re members - which include most of the main UK-based commercial
insurance providers - have to supply terrorism insurance on fixed
terms and rates. Premiums collected by insurers are pooled and used to
pay any claims. If Pool Re ran out of money, the government would make
up the shortfall.

Since the IRA ceasefire was announced last year, premium rates have
fallen. But buyers and brokers say the system remains inflexible and
expensive.

Airmic is proposing a scheme in which all commercial property policies
would include a flat contribution towards the costs of Pool Re,
allowing a return to the automatic provision of cover against terrorist
attack.

COMPANY NEWS (THIS WEEK):
CHRISTMAS BRINGS CHEER TO TRADING STATEMENTS - UK RETAILERS

   By NEIL BUCKLEY

Expect to hear news of another strong Christmas as large retailers make
their January trading statements, writes Neil Buckley. Christmas
accounts for a large part of many retailers' annual profits. Reports of
a buoyant December and good start to the post-Christmas sales have
breathed life back into a sector depressed by gloomy results in the
autumn.

Three retailers thought to have had the liveliest festive seasons -
Argos, Dixons and Next - report next week. Argos should unveil a total
sales increase in double digits for the third Christmas running, while
Next is expected to have at least maintained the 10 per cent increase
reported in September. Dixons is forecast to report a 10 per cent
increase in like-for-like sales, which exclude new store openings, over
Christmas.

Also reporting the same week are Boots and Sears. In the former, strong
performances from Boots the Chemists and Halfords will be tarnished
slightly by sales declines in Do It All, and the Fads/Homestyle home
decorating business. For Sears, total sales are expected to be slightly
up, but like-for-like sales down.

The following week, Body Shop, Storehouse and Marks and Spencer are
forecast to report sales increases of at least 5 per cent. At House of
Fraser a like-for-like increase of perhaps 3 per cent is expected.

One year after the poor trading statement that sparked the departure of
four directors, Kingfisher is expected to reveal recoveries in
Woolworths and Comet, but falling sales in Darty, the French electrical
chain.

WH Smith is forecast to report a Christmas sales increase of up to 7
per cent in its interim results on January 24, while Burton, at its
annual meeting the following day, is expected to announce a continuing
improvement in sales and gross margins.

NEW LOOK RETAILER SOLD TO INSTITUTIONS FOR POUNDS 170M

   By TIM BURT

New Look, the privately-owned fashion retailer founded by entrepreneur
Mr Tom Singh was yesterday sold to a venture capital buy-out group for
about Pounds 170m.

Mr Singh, who started the company in 1969 with a Pounds 5,000 loan, has
agreed to sell the 323-store chain to institutional purchasers led by
BZW Private Equity and jointly underwritten by Prudential Venture
Managers.

The sale follows New Look's abortive attempt to come to the market in
October 1994, which it abandoned the day before its scheduled flotation
amid fears it would not raise the estimated Pounds 150m it was seeking.

Under the terms of yesterday's deal, New Look's shareholders -
dominated by Mr Singh and his family trusts - will initially receive
about Pounds 105m in cash and shares worth about Pounds 50m in Vallsar,
an investment vehicle set up for the transaction.

That will leave the Singhs with 25 per cent of Vallsar, which is to be
renamed New Look. BZW Private Equity has also offered a further Pounds
15m payment contingent on New Look's performance in the three years to
March 1998.

Mr Gavin Aldred, New Look's director in charge of corporate strategy,
said proceeds from the disposal would fund expansion: 'In the 12 months
to March this year, we will have opened 76 stores in the UK and 10 in
France, and we aim to continue growing at about 50 outlets a year.' He
claimed New Look - advised by J. Henry Schroder - was Britain's most
profitable specialist women's wear retailer. In the year to March last
year, pre-tax profits more than doubled from Pounds 6.01m to Pounds 15m
on sales of Pounds 141m (Pounds 83.4m).

Its rival Etam, by comparison, reported first-half losses of Pounds
3.85m in the autumn, against pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.74m.

Mr Graeme White, a director of BZW Private Equity, praised New Look's
operating performance and said the existing management would remain.

Mr White has joined an enlarged board of New Look as a non-executive
director, as has Mr Martin Clarke of Prudential Venture Managers. He
said the two backers had no timetable for an exit, but did not rule out
a fresh flotation attempt.

COMPANY NEWS (THIS WEEK): GREENBURY GUIDELINES WILL BE PUT TO THE TEST
- OTHER COMPANIES

   By WILLIAM LEWIS

The Greenbury committee's report on executive pay
will move into the spotlight in January and February, with the
publication of a consultation document and several companies' annual
meetings held under Greenbury rules for the first time, writes William
Lewis.

Next Monday, a consultation document on possible methods for disclosing
the true value of directors' pensions will be launched. The Faculty of
Actuaries and the Institute of Actuaries, together with the Stock
Exchange and the Department of Trade and Industry, are to send the
paper to public companies and are seeking their views by February 9.

The Greenbury committee's report, published in July, recommended that
pension costs be disclosed to shareholders to reflect the value to the
individual as well as the true cost to the company.

The Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries put forward a
preferred method but there were calls for wider consultation.

Many companies feared that directors' remuneration could appear to
increase by startling amounts under the new code. The consultation
document will include a number of options - including allowing for the
'smoothing' out of the effects of Greenbury.

Other Greenbury recommendations have already been put in place by some
companies and are due to be tested at annual meetings in the next few
weeks.

Bass and Burton, in their annual reports sent to shareholders last
month, were the first companies to give a separate remuneration
committee report on executive pay. Both companies' remuneration
committee chairmen will be answering shareholder questions on pay at
the meetings on February 8 and January 25 respectively.

Greenbury also recommended that companies seek shareholder approval for
new long-term incentive schemes. Burton and Capital Radio on January 17
will ask shareholders to vote through new schemes for executives.

Following the rule changes announced in the November budget regarding
the taxation of executive share options, Euromoney and Berisford are
asking shareholders to approve changes to their executive share option
schemes. Berisford's meeting is on January 22 and Euromoney's is on
January 18.

US investors are looking forward to some good news this month as most

Analysts prefer to look at the 'operating earnings', excluding one-off

FORTE TO EXPAND THROUGH MERIDIEN

   By DAVID BLACKWELL

Forte, the UK's biggest hotels group, is planning a further 26 Meridien
hotels in a push to expand internationally.

The move is expected to be announced in today's final defence document
against the Pounds 3.3bn hostile bid from Granada Group, the
television, catering and leisure group.

Forte is also likely to promise a special dividend or share buy-back if
the Pounds 1.05bn sale of its roadside businesses to Whitbread goes
through. Last week, the group agreed to sell its Little Chef and Happy
Eater roadside restaurants, Welcome Break motorway service areas and
Travelodge budget hotels to the UK brewing and leisure group. The deal
is conditional on the failure of Granada's bid.

The document is expected to include a promise to increase annual
dividends, which were cut from 9.91p to 7.5p for the year to January 31
1993 and were last raised five years ago.

The document will show that Christie & Co, the property surveyor, has
revalued the hotels upwards by Pounds 355m to Pounds 3.35bn, just over
10 per cent above the last estimate in January 1994 and representing
net asset value per share of 325p. This excludes the stake in the Savoy
Group, which Forte plans to sell.

The revaluation was dismissed by Granada, which said if the increase
had been added to assets on July 31 last year, the return on assets
would have fallen from 7.4 to 6.5 per cent. 'Frankly, this looks like a
bit of an own goal by Forte,' said Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada chief
executive.

Forte paid Pounds 280m to acquire the Meridien chain of 58 hotels from
Air France just over a year ago in order to give it a bigger
international presence. Of the 26 new projects under consideration, one
is in Manchester and all the others abroad, including Beirut and
Bangkok.

Most will be management contracts, although equity stakes have not been
ruled out. Expansion in the US remains a priority.

Sir Rocco Forte, chairman, said the main thrust for Meridien would be
overseas. The first year had been spent in integrating the business,
and Pounds 14m had been taken from head office costs.

'We have only just started,' he said. 'Now we will be much more
pro-active.'

Today's document will concentrate almost entirely on the hotels, giving
details of performance. Meridien is expected to have contributed 20 per
cent to group operating profits.

Operating profits from Forte's Exclusive hotels - including the
Georges V in Paris and the Grosvenor House in London - are expected to
account for 10 per cent of hotel profits, with other London hotels
accounting for 25 per cent. The Posthouse (including Crest) and
Heritage traditional hotels are likely to show contributions of 25 per
cent and 20 per cent respectively.

LONDON BRACES ITSELF FOR A REPO REVOLUTION: AN OPEN MARKET IN SALE AND
REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS FOR UK GOVERNMENT BONDS STARTS TODAY

   By RICHARD LAPPER and PHILIP GAWITH

Dealers in UK government bonds are today braced for one of the biggest
changes in the City since Big Bang 10 years ago.

The introduction of an open market in gilt repos, agreements to sell
and then repurchase government bonds, will allow all participants in
the market to borrow and lend stock, removing the monopoly over such
activity that a select number of firms have long enjoyed and bringing
the UK market into line with practices in the US and France.

The Treasury and Bank of England hope the changes will make it easier
for investors to trade gilts, increasing their attractions to overseas
investors and ultimately reducing the cost of funding government debt.
But in the longer term, the development of repos could also lead to
broader changes in the structure of the UK's short-term money markets
and in the way that the Bank of England manages liquidity.

'I'm not saying that repo is going to take off overnight but it is the
brave new world,' says Ms Una van Dorssen, director of repo marketing
at NatWest Markets.

In simple terms, a repo is an agreement to sell a security and then
repurchase it at an agreed future price and date.

One party to the deal 'borrows' money, using the security as a
collateral. The other party 'lends' the money and 'borrows' the bond,
in much the same way as a pawnbroker would take temporary possession of
valuables in return for a personal loan. But although the repo looks
like a loan, in reality it encompasses a disposal and a subsequent
acquisition, reducing credit risk in the event of default by either
party.

And in the international bond markets, repos play a more complex
economic function. Dealers frequently borrow money through repos to
fund the purchases of the same bonds, which are then committed as
collateral. Securities firms usually rely on this means to finance
their operations as they do not have access to the interbank markets
where banks lend to each other.

At the same time, dealers 'lend' money through repo agreements, in a
similar way to how they might place money on deposit with a bank,
although in this case they have the additional security of holding a
bond as collateral. At the same time, the 'borrowed' bonds can be used
to meet short-term trading needs. In the bond markets, dealers
frequently take short positions (sell bonds they do not own), when they
feel prices are likely to fall.

In the UK, the ability to carry out repos or to borrow or lend
government stock through stock lending agreements has been restricted
by law to stock exchange money brokers - effectively middlemen. In
addition, only gilt-edged market-makers, a group of more than 20
securities firms licensed by the Bank of England, have been allowed to
'short' the market.

The new, more liberal rules will make it possible for a much wider
range of traders and investors to operate in the UK gilts market. 'The
fact that it is now seen as a clear and open market will make it
attractive. It will encourage people into the marketplace. They no
longer see it as an esoteric market with rules of its own,' says Mr
David Brayshaw, managing director LM Money Brokers.

Ms van Dorssen at NatWest Markets says that with a deep and liquid
underlying market and a robust futures market in place, repo's
development will increase the range of strategies open to traders.

The impact of repo on the UK's money markets should also be
significant. 'It will be beneficial for the money market and should
help to restore liquidity,' says Mr Brayshaw. 'There has been a lack of
short-dated government paper that can be traded. Also, the overnight
market, which determines funding costs, has come to be dominated by a
small group of players.'

Ms Van Dorssen says cash managers will be able to place larger amounts
of money on 'a repo line' than on an 'unsecured deposit line'.

And in the short term, at least until liquidity in the market picks up,
dealers expect repo rates to be close to the London interbank rates,
offering investors the double advantage of security and extra yield.

Nevertheless, traditional market participants may take time to adapt to
the new environment.

Some UK institutions, which currently earn a fee by lending stock on
their books to money brokers, may have to modify their systems and
learn new skills. Specialists in managing medium and long-term
investments, they may be less prepared for the demands of short-term
money market management necessary in the repo market. And dealers may
prefer to obtain finance through existing relationships with money
brokers.

In the long term, however, dealing directly with other dealers and
investors through repos should become cheaper and more attractive. Mr
Simon Briscoe, chief UK economist at Nikko Europe, says money market
operators will respond to repo in a similar way to how British
motorists responded to the opening of the motorways in the early 1960s.

'It wasn't an immediate transition. Even though motorways allowed for
more traffic and bigger lorries people still use the A roads.'

DISNEY AIMS TO PUMP UP THE VOLUME

   By ALICE RAWSTHORN

Walt Disney, the US entertainment group which recently bid Dollars 19bn
(Pounds 12.2bn) for the Capital Cities/ABC television company, plans to
strengthen its presence in the music business.

It is believed to have joined forces in the autumn with PolyGram, the
world's largest record company, in an attempt to sign up Janet Jackson,
the US singer. Mr Michael Eisner, group chairman, wanted to sign her in
the hope that a high-profile star would raise Disney's stature in the
music market and attract other acts.

Under the terms of Disney's agreement with PolyGram, Ms Jackson would
have split her recording contract between the two groups. She would
have signed to Disney in North America and to A&M, the PolyGram
subsidiary which was her original record label, for the rest of the
world.

It now looks as though Janet Jackson will sign a new contract with
Virgin Music, the record label to which she has been contracted since
1991 when her A&M deal ended. Virgin, owned by Thorn EMI, the UK
leisure group, is thought to have out-bid Disney and PolyGram just
before Christmas, although it has not yet signed a contract with Ms
Jackson.

Mr Eisner is still keen for Disney to expand in the music market, which
is one of the fastest growing and most profitable areas of the
entertainment industry. Until now the focus of the group's music
interests has been its Hollywood Records subsidiary founded six years
ago.

Hollywood's performance has been erratic. It has released a number of
highly successful soundtrack albums under the Walt Disney record label.
The Lion King, the soundtrack to the 1994 animated hit, has sold more
than 9m copies in the US. But it has failed to become a force in the
marketplace.

One option for Disney would be to continue to try to attract
high-profile stars. This could be slow and expensive as there is fierce
competition among rival labels for best-selling acts. An alternative
would be to bid for EMI Music, the Thorn EMI division that owns Virgin,
which is expected to be demerged from the rest of the Thorn EMI group
next autumn. But Disney could face fierce competition from other North
American companies.

MEDIOBANCA TO GIVE FERFIN OFFER TERMS

   By ROBERT GRAHAM

   ROME


Mediobanca, the powerful Milan merchant bank, is expected to reveal
shortly the terms of its public offer to buy 158m shares of Ferruzzi
Finanziaria (Ferfin), the holding company that controls the Montedison
industrial group.

The move has been forced upon Mediobanca after it lost two judicial
appeals against a public offer for an amount of shares equal to those
acquired in an October raid to gain control of Ferfin. The completion
of the offer will mean Mediobanca will hold 15.26 per cent of Ferfin,
with an estimated disbursement of L582bn (Dollars 367m).

Mediobanca finally accepted the ruling of Consob, the stock exchange
watch dog, late last Friday. It had initially lodged an appeal with the
regional administrative court of Lazio, and when that failed with the
higher court of the state council.

Pricing of the offer presents several problems. Principal among these
has been the L953bn Ferfin rights issue in mid-December. This came well
after Consob's first ruling that Mediobanca must make a public offer.
Before the rights issue, analysts suggested L1,580 per share
represented the average price paid by Mediobanca in its October raid on
Ferfin.

But just before the rights issue they were suspended at L1,056; and
Consob announced only shareholders on the register before the issue
could be the subject of Mediobanca's public buy offer. This point is
apparently being questioned by Mediobanca's lawyers.

Analysts also pointed out that by being obliged to acquire 15 per cent
of Ferfin, the outlay represented over 10 per cent of Mediobanca's
assets, a large exposure.

HEALTH GROUPS ABANDON MERGER

   By RICHARD WATERS

   NEW YORK


After a busy year of consolidation, the US healthcare industry ended
1995 on a sour note with the formal dissolution of a Dollars 1.6bn
merger that would have created the country's largest managed care
organisation.

WellPoint and Health Systems International, two Californian healthcare
groups, abandoned a merger agreement reached last April. Friday's
development came two weeks after the two organisations announced they
were in discussions to break off merger talks, and follows indications
that executives from each side were unable to reach agreement on how to
share power in the new company.

The merger would have created a West Coast giant with the financial
muscle to acquire other managed care groups around the country. The two
had listed the ability to grow beyond their Californian base as a key
reason for the combination.

Under the terms of the all-stock deal, shareholders in Health Systems
would have received 45 per cent of the shares in the combined group.
However, the two sides are believed to have been unable to agree on
what role the smaller company's managers should play after a merger.
The deal would have provided the springboard for a far more widely-held
public company than either is at present.

VICTORS AND VICTIMS OF BOARDROOM UPHEAVAL - TIM BURT LOOKS AT THE HIGH
NUMBER OF COMPANIES STARTING THE YEAR WITH A CHANGE OF LEADERSHIP

   By TIM BURT

An unprecedented number of Britain's leading companies are beginning
1996 with newly-installed chairmen and chief executives following a
year of boardroom upheaval.

Groups such as BAT Industries and Inchcape have new chairmen, while
British Telecommunications, BTR, BOC, WH Smith, and electronic
components manufacturer Bowthorpe are among those to bring in new chief
executives.

Their arrival - mostly part of a smooth succession - comes after a year
in which other high-profile directors became boardroom casualties,
including Lord Young and Mr James Ross, chairman and chief executive
respectively of Cable & Wireless.

Mr Tiny Rowland left Lonrho after losing his long-running battle with
Mr Dieter Bock, the trading group's chief executive. Other departures
included Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential; Mr Richard
Reynolds, a director of GEC; Mr Howard Robinson, chief executive at
Calor Group; and Sir Brian Wolfson, chairman of Wembley.

Russell Reynolds, the UK's largest headhunter in revenue terms, said
the number of arrivals and departures reflected the growing influence
of institutional shareholders and non-executive directors in bringing
in new management.

'We're seeing a trend that when companies are having a very difficult
time the executives are being brought to account,' said Mr David
Shellard, managing director.

He cited the Cadbury committee on corporate governance as one factor
behind the increased turnover among company directors, while adding
that the Greenbury committee on executive remuneration had focused
shareholder attention on performance-related pay.

Heidrick & Struggles International, the London-based executive
recruitment agency, said the rash of outside appointments also
signalled a growing skills shortage at board level. Mr John Viney,
chairman, said: 'There are simply too few people to go round. So we're
seeing the best, such as Sir Colin Marshall, taking on two or three
roles.'

Sir Colin, chairman of British Airways, yesterday became non-executive
chairman of Inchcape, the international marketing and services group.

'Inchcape has not been in the best of health,' Mr Viney added. 'They
know it's much better to have a top-class person - even if only for one
day a week - than someone less effective,'

Among the other new arrivals this month, Lord Cairns, who last year
resigned as chief executive of SG Warburg, the investment bank, becomes
chairman of BAT Industries.

Mr Ian Strachan succeeds Mr Alan Jackson as chief executive of BTR. Sir
Peter Bonfield, knighted in the New Year honours, moves from computer
group ICL to be chief executive of BT. Mr Bill Cockburn has become
chief executive at WH Smith.

Mr Tim Parker is taking over as chief executive at CJ Clark, the
shoemakers. Mr Nicholas Brookes is the new chief executive at
Bowthorpe. And BOC, the industrial gases group, will mark its annual
meeting later this month with the appointment of Mr David John and Mr
Danny Rosenkranz as new chairman and chief executive respectively.

NATIONWIDE LOOKS TO LIFE OPERATION

   By ALISON SMITH, Investment Correspondent

Nationwide, the UK's second largest building society, is looking to its
new life assurance and unit trust subsidiaries, which open today, to
enable it to reduce its dependence on mortgage-related financial
services.

The new operations replace the relationship in life assurance that
Nationwide has had with Guardian since the beginning of 1990s.

Mr Tom Boardman, managing director of the two new subsidiaries, said
that whereas in selling Guardian's financial services about four-fifths
of Nationwide's business was mortgage-related, he hoped that within a
couple of years this could be reduced to about half.

This strategy seems to acknowledge that endowment mortgages are
becoming less popular and that any recovery in the housing market over
the next couple of years is unlikely to match the pace of the 1980s.

Nationwide has also set itself the target of winning 70,000 financial
services customers in the first year - about 1 per cent of its total 7m
customer base.

This is more ambitious than the 40,000-plus financial services
customers it is thought to have gained each year during the six-year
tie with Guardian.

The new life company will sell term assurance, a mortgage endowment
policy, a guaranteed equity bond and a personal pension plan. The unit
trust operation will sell two unit trusts - a UK growth fund and a
balanced fund which includes an element of overseas exposure.

Apart from the policies it designs itself, Nationwide Life will also
sell a permanent health insurance policy bought in from PPP, the
healthcare company.

This is a smaller and simpler range than the Guardian policies which
Nationwide has been offering, but Mr Boardman said the straightforward
nature of the products should help to keep costs down. He believed the
range was still broad enough to meet most customers' needs.

For Nationwide, as for other mortgage lenders which have set up their
own financial services businesses, a key element will be to market
these products to the entire customer base - savers as well as
borrowers.

Initially, Nationwide's salaried financial services sales force will be
made up of about 340 agents and will grow to 380 by the end of
February. Just over half of these will be branch-based, with the
remainder available to visit customers.

FRENCH BANK SEEKS SHORT-TERM FINANCE

   By ANDREW JACK

   PARIS


Credit Foncier de France, the specialist French property bank, is
considering obtaining a substantial short-term bridging loan while it
undertakes a wide-ranging restructuring plan.

Bank executives are believed to be discussing the idea of seeking a
loan from a commercial bank, secured on its assets, which would last
about three years.

Separately, they are holding talks with the government about short-term
ways to stave off the growing financial crisis triggered by the
withdrawal of its monopoly rights over certain state-backed housing
loan schemes.

The idea is to provide the bank with time to introduce a restructuring
programme which could reduce costs by 30 to 40 per cent in as little as
the next two years, including job cuts and the possible sale of some of
its central Paris offices.

However, executives want to reduce staffing without any redundancies so
they are likely to extend the length of their programme to at least
three years.

They are also discussing refocusing the bank, possibly by withdrawing
from activities such as loans to property developers and local
authorities, and concentrating on core activities of loans to low and
middle-income housing projects.

Credit Foncier's ability to raise funds on the capital markets has been
tightly restricted recently because its share price has dropped sharply
and its credit rating has fallen.

It was dealt a severe blow during December when the French stock market
regulators recommended against it proceeding with a proposed merger
with its 55 per cent-owned subsidiary, Societe des Immeubles de France.

The deal would have provided a much-needed FFr1bn (Dollars 204m) boost
to its balance sheet. It is now looking at other ways of achieving a
recapitalisation.

The bank is also likely to discuss with the French government, in the
medium-term, a change to its legal statutes to make it more like its
private sector competitors.

Although it is a quoted company without any state shareholding, the
government appoints its chairman or 'governor'.

HYUNDAI TO ACCELERATE DECENTRALISATION - SOUTH KOREA'S BIGGEST
FAMILY-RUN 'CHAEBOL' IS MOVING WITH THE TIMES

   By JOHN BURTON

Mr Chung Mong-koo, Hyundai's new chairman, is likely to preside over
the gradual break-up of the giant family-owned South Korean industrial
group his father established in 1947.

That, however, is the way Mr Chung Ju-yung, the Hyundai founder, wants
it. In an attempt to avoid a family fight over the Hyundai empire after
his death, Mr Chung decided several years ago to divide it among
several of his sons and nephews by transferring his stock in most of
Hyundai's 45 companies to them.

The result has been the creation of smaller and decentralised groups
within Hyundai that amount to a confederation of allied companies.

The process is expected to accelerate with the recent formal transfer
of management control from the elder Mr Chung and his brother Chung
Se-yung, who succeeded him as chairman in 1987, to their sons.

Hyundai's restructuring, which is expected to benefit the group, could
serve as an example to Korea's other conglomerates, or chaebol. The
chaebol have been widely criticised for being too big and inefficient
while fierce competition, for example, has led to duplication of
activity.

Government officials have long urged them to abandon many of their
marginal businesses and concentrate on a few specialised industrial
sectors to improve their global competitiveness.

Splitting Hyundai into smaller groups is expected to help achieve these
goals. Each mini-Hyundai group focuses on only a few industries, and
these units are less able to support unprofitable activities than they
were within the old monolithic structure.

Under a reorganisation plan announced a year ago, Hyundai was divided
into six main groups, with almost all now controlled by one of Mr
Chung's sons and nephews.

The most ambitious of the new sub-groups is the one controlled by Mr
Chung Mong-koo, the new Hyundai chairman and eldest surviving son of
the Hyundai founder.

In 1977, he established Hyundai Precision & Industry as a cargo
container company, which became the world's largest. Hyundai Precision
now produces railway engines and carriages, sports and utility
vehicles, and military equipment. It also plans to enter the aerospace
sector, assembling aircraft and satellites.

Mong-koo also controls Hyundai's small steel operations, which he wants
to expand by building a large mill that would supply steel to Hyundai's
car and shipbuilding operations.

Mr Chung Mong-hun, his brother and the new Hyundai vice-chairman, has
developed Hyundai Electronics into one of the world's biggest producers
of computer memory chips in less than a decade. Another brother, Mr
Chung Mong-jun, controls Hyundai's shipbuilding operations, the biggest
in Korea.

Hyundai Motors, Korea's largest car company and considered the group's
crown jewel, is being taken over by the family of Mr Chung Se-yung, the
brother of the Hyundai founder. His only son, Mong-kyu, has been
appointed as the car company's new chairman at the age of 33.

Mr Chung Mong-hyuk, another nephew of the Hyundai founder, has been
named new president of Hyundai's petrochemical and oil refining
companies, another growth area.

Other main Hyundai companies, including its trading house and
construction company, remain under the control of the group founder.

A formal break-up of Hyundai is likely to take some time since the
group is held together by a complex web of cross-holdings. These ties,
however, should weaken as the government imposes limits on
cross-holding arrangements in attempt to reduce the economic dominance
of the chaebol.

Family solidarity is also expected to prevent an early break-up of
Hyundai. The Hyundai companies are likely to operate on the same basis
that Mr Chung Ju-yung has established with several of his brothers, who
have created their own small industrial groups that partly depend on
Hyundai for business.

Hyundai Motors, for example, is the biggest customer for the motor
vehicle parts company of the Halla group, founded by Mr Chung In-yung.

Nonetheless, internal conflict may also increase as rivalry grows
between the Hyundai companies. Hyundai Precision, for example, is
challenging Hyundai Motors by producing four-wheel drive vehicles and
mini-vans.

A looser organisational structure may also make it more difficult to
push through large projects that were once easily tackled under the
autocratic management style of the Hyundai founder.

Analysts will also be watching closely to see whether the new Hyundai
chairman can gain group support for his projected Dollars 10bn steel
mill, which has been criticised by some Hyundai subsidiaries as
unnecessary.

NETSCAPE LEADS THE FASHION FOR US NEW ISSUES - FT WRITERS LOOK AT THE
BEST PERFORMING SHARES AROUND THE WORLD IN 1995 / BEST AND WORST SECTORS

   By Our New York staff and ANDREW FISHER

   FRANKFURT


New issues - if you could lay your hands on them - were the hottest
performing stocks in the US last year, with Netscape Communications,
the Internet company, racing to the fore, writes our New York staff.

The market for initial public offerings was more active than it had
ever been, but the few sceptics that remained claimed this was a sure
indication the US market was way out in front of most traditional
valuations measures.

Netscape, which produces a browser for the Internet, was floated in
August at Dollars 28 a share, and by year-end it was trading at Dollars
139, having reached a peak in early December of Dollars 174.

Other strongly performing new issues included Pixar, which handled the
animation for Disney's latest hit film Toy Story. It floated at Dollars
22 just after the film's opening at Thanksgiving, and quickly reached a
high of Dollars 49 1/2, although by year-end it had fallen back to
around Dollars 28 7/8.

Many of the new issues were in the technology sector, which had led the
market higher for much of the year, although towards the end of the
year many of these stocks faltered as growth in semiconductor sales
slowed.

The technology sector's performance should not obscure notable gains in
other sectors. Lower interest rates and hopes for productivity gains
made bank and insurance company shares among the best performers.
Banks, deep into a round of mergers, recorded gains of more than 50 per
cent.

Steel companies, most of which crawled back into profit only in 1994,
managed the dubious distinction of forming the worst-performing stock
market sector.

Another poor performer was the retail sector, which ended another
difficult year with a disappointing Christmas.

CONSTRUCTION FALLS

Building sites abound in German cities and cranes cover the Frankfurt
skyline, but construction shares headed remorselessly downwards in
1995, writes Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt. The sector's share performance
slumped by 33 per cent and 1996 is not expected to show much, if any,
improvement.

By contrast, the electrical and electronics sector had a strong year,
adding 34 per cent. Apart from Siemens, reaping the benefits of its
aggressively profit-oriented restructuring, the sector contains SAP,
the fast-growing producer of business software. SAP's share performance
has been meteoric in the past two years, though it has slowed recently.

Commerzbank, whose own new headquarters is taking shape in Frankfurt,
estimates that profits of quoted construction companies will rise a
mere 2 per cent in 1996 after 6 per cent in 1995. The German commercial
and homes building boom is now over, with public sector construction
also held back by budget constraints.

Mr Ingo Mainert, a Commerzbank analyst, says stocks likely to perform
in line with or better than the overall market this year include
motors, steel, electricals and electronics, and insurance.

The bank foresees the DAX index rising to 2,500 or even 2,600 points
after it closed on Friday at 2,254, a rise of 7 per cent on the year. A
year ago, the bank had hoped for 2,400 but the weak dollar and higher
than expected pay rises threw out its calculations.

For electrical and electronics companies, Commerzbank expects an
overall profits rise of 21 per cent this year after 22 per cent in
1995. Earnings in the steel, engineering, motor and metal industries
should show steeper rises, it says.

Further markets will be covered
over the following days.

THOMAS LOCKER'S BID FOR PENTRE ATTACKED

   By TIM BURT

The largest shareholder in Thomas Locker yesterday claimed the
engineering group was seeking a reverse takeover with its proposed
Pounds 7.5m bid for Pentre, the industrial drums manufacturer.

Mr John Carr, who holds 22.6 per cent of Thomas Locker's ordinary
shares, said the purchase price overvalued Pentre: 'The shareholders of
Thomas Locker not only get no premium for the very significant value
inherent in the company they own, they are being asked to approve a
scheme that will lose them control.'

Mr Carr, who acquired his stake in the company last May, urged
shareholders to reject the acquisition, which is being funded by the
issue of 8.62m new and 25.9m A ordinary shares. He also condemned as
inadequate a proposed 3-for-10 scrip issue of additional ordinary
shares, designed to compensate ordinary shareholders for the loss of
voting rights.

The dissident shareholder, advised by KPMG, said there was no logic for
Thomas Locker in acquiring Pentre, which he claimed was burdened with
Pounds 6.9m borrowings.

Neither company was available for comment.

ANXIOUS EYES FOCUS ON COPPER - COMMODITIES

   By RICHARD MOONEY

London Metal Exchange dealers returning from their festive break today
will be anxious to ascertain the new year mood of the copper market,
which is likely to set the tone for other base metals contracts as
well.

Last week's lightly-traded inter-holiday period ended with the copper
market close to its 1995 low as stocks soared towards the excessive
level at which they ended 1994. At 296,425 tonnes they were more than
double the July low.

With further rises in stocks expected, analysts and traders were
predicting further falls this week. '(Stop loss selling orders) were
triggered below Dollars 2,665 earlier today,' one trader told the
Reuters news agency on Friday afternoon, 'and more are likely to be
lurking below Dollars 2,650. . . copper is back on shaky ground.'
Several analysts forecast that copper would drop to Dollars 2,500 in
the medium term as new production capacity came on stream and stocks
continued to accumulate.

The steady increase in stocks over recent weeks has been encouraged by
big premiums available for immediate delivery at the LME. As the stocks
have risen these premiums - known as 'backwardations' - have narrowed.
'If stocks keep rising, and we do expect they will, then the spreads
should come in even more,' Adam Rowley of Macquarie Equities told
Reuters.

'At some stage in the first quarter of 1996 we are looking for quite a
sharp fall in copper prices,' he added.

'With February/March at Dollars 80 to Dollars 90 backwardation it looks
as if this period will stay tight,' said Wolfgang Becker of Iceni
Commodities Brokerage. 'Obviously at some stage the whole thing will be
reversed, but this sort of stock rise may be a bear trap.'

Options traders told Reuters prices could overshoot downside targets if
hedging against large put (selling) positions below the market gathered
pace. 'We are just waiting for copper's resilience to end and when it
does the market could collapse,' one said.

ASSESSING THE POWER OF MULTINATIONALS - GLOBAL INVESTOR

   By TONY JACKSON

   NEW YORK


A noisy debate has broken out in that quiet retreat for the weekend
reader, the book review section of the New York Times. It revives an
issue which some might have thought buried: the power of the
multinationals. It is also a useful reminder that the triumph of free
trade - an idea implicit in most investment strategies today - cannot
be taken for granted.

The opening salvo came in a review by the political theorist Mr Francis
Fukuyama of a book called Opposing The System. The book, by a veteran
leftist Mr Charles Reich, reportedly argues that the current social
malaise - poverty, unemployment and so forth - has been engineered by
large corporations for their own benefit. Therefore, it says, the
powers of government should be increased to control them.

Mr Fukuyama regarded this as 1960s claptrap. The remedies proposed by
Mr Reich, he argued, had got us into this mess in the first place.
Poverty and crime were caused not by big companies, but by big
government.

Enter stage left another 1960s veteran, the consumers' champion Mr
Ralph Nader. Big corporations, he wrote in reply, erode democracy,
export jobs, and weaken the legal safeguards for workers, consumers and
the environment. 'Until Mr Fukuyama understands that a society rots
from the head down and that corporate power needs analysis, he will
never understand Mr Reich's thesis,' he concluded.

So far, so familiar. But the role of the multinationals is becoming
part of a wider issue: that of free trade. If you believe that free
trade is destroying jobs and damaging society, you are bound to blame
the multinationals as its agents.

As another book recently put it, global free trade 'will impoverish and
destabilise the industrialised world, while at the same time cruelly
ravaging the third world.' The author is no 1960s leftist, but the
erstwhile corporate raider Sir James Goldsmith.

As a blend of right-wing populist and born-again environmentalist, Sir
James forms an unlikely bridge between the two wings of protectionism.
On the right, he is joined by the US presidential candidate Mr Pat
Buchanan and by the fellow-billionaire Mr Ross Perot.

On the left, he links with those who argue that free trade enables bad
environmental practice to drive out good: that through the agency -
again - of the multinationals, production will gravitate to countries
free from costly environmental controls.

Those who feel paranoid about the unholy alliance of free-trade
governments and big business can point to one central fact. As the
chart reminds us, world trade has indeed been growing rapidly in
relation to the world economy since the late 1980s, having previously
grown in line.

But are corporations growing in proportion? The evidence is mixed. Last
year, the three biggest US companies by revenues, as listed by Fortune
magazine, were General Motors, Ford and Exxon. Their combined sales of
Dollars 384bn (Pounds 249.3bn) were equal to 5.7 per cent of US GDP.
The figure for the same trio 20 years before was 6.7 per cent.

But if US multinationals are not bigger, they may still be more
powerful. Arguably, modern communications and the lowering of trade
barriers give them much more opportunity to arbitrage labour and
capital around the world. Hence the solution of such as Mr Buchanan:
put the barriers up again.

It might be thought that the impulse to free trade is politically
unstoppable: and indeed, that in the coming world of the Internet the
genie cannot be put back in the bottle anyway.

Not everyone in the investment community agrees. The highly successful
investor Mr George Soros, for instance, argues that electronic trade is
not intrinsically different from the old kind, just faster. It would be
perfectly feasible to re-impose exchange controls, he says. Single
countries could not do it, but groups of countries could.

Mr Soros is gloomily convinced that the present world order, which he
regards as a golden age of capitalism, will ultimately break down. The
last comparable period, he says, was the end of the 19th century. In
those days, 'the British Empire was at the heart of the system, and had
an interest in maintaining security. When there was trouble, it sent a
gunboat. Now there is no chief beneficiary (from stability): certainly
not the US.'

Should the average investor worry about all this? Not for the time
being, perhaps. Both of the likely protagonists in next year's US
presidential elections, Mr Clinton and Mr Robert Dole, are professed
free traders: although both will bear watching for signs of concessions
to their respective outer wings.

The point is rather that the case for a prolonged global bull market
contains an internal contradiction. On the one hand, we are told that
multinational corporations are enjoying a one-off shift to greater
productivity and cheaper labour, based largely on the globalisation of
markets. On the other, we are told the globalising process does not
entail empoverishing one set of workers to the benefit of another. Free
trade means faster growth, so the pie gets bigger.

This worked very well for small countries like Taiwan and Korea, which
were able to develop and open up at their own pace. It is another
matter, to paraphrase Sir James Goldsmith, when political upheaval,
modern communications and the liberalisation of capital movements hurl
4bn workers into the world economy in the space of a few years.

Hence the internal contradiction. Proponents of the bull market argue
that the shift in power between capital and labour is profound enough
to last for a generation. The question is what that generation will
make of it. If it feels disposed to rebel, global free trade could be
the first casualty.

MARKETS:
TIME TO REWRITE INFLATION TARGET - ECONOMICS NOTEBOOK

   By ROBERT CHOTE

Over the last five years many countries have adopted formal targets for
inflation as the centrepiece of their economic policies. But turning a
vaguely expressed enthusiasm for low inflation into a precise numerical
objective is not as straightforward as it sounds.

For one thing, policymakers face a trade-off between the need to
establish credibility and to demonstrate humility. Any target has to be
demanding enough to persuade people that the authorities are serious
about achieving low inflation; but it cannot be too demanding because
credibility will then be lost again when the target proves impossible
to hit.

In 1992 Britain adopted a formal inflation target comprising three
objectives: underlying inflation between 1 and 4 per cent until spring
1997; between 1 and 2.5 per cent in spring 1997; and below 2 per cent
in the long term. The most demanding element soon slipped from public
consciousness, but the first two stayed in place. By last summer,
however, the remaining target had to be updated. Interest rate changes
take about two years to affect prices, so it was becoming too late to
do much about inflation within the target period.

Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, announced therefore in his Mansion
House speech that he would aim for underlying inflation of 2.5 per cent
or less beyond spring 1997. He predicted this would keep inflation
between 1 and 4 per cent most of the time, recognising that unexpected
events might push inflation higher when it was too late for
policymakers to react.

This formulation has caused confusion ever since and influential voices
have argued that it needs rewriting again. Sir Terry Burns, the
permanent secretary to the Treasury, said shortly before Christmas that
the government should move away from targeting a range for inflation,
concentrating instead on a single figure. Some senior officials at the
Bank of England agree.

The Mansion House speech left many questions unanswered in the minds of
City and academic economists. Was the new target looser or tighter than
its predecessor? Was the inflation objective 1 to 2.5 per cent, 1 to 4
per cent or 2.5 per cent and below?

The conduct of interest rate policy in subsequent months only deepened
the mystery. Mr Eddie George had told the chancellor in May that
inflation was set to exceed 2.5 per cent in two years' time and that he
should therefore raise rates. The chancellor refused because he thought
inflation would be lower. Economists were unnerved by the disagreement,
but at least both sides appeared to agree on the definition of the
target - 2.5 per cent or below.

But in September the Bank muddied the waters. It continued to predict
that inflation would exceed 2.5 per cent in two years' time, but
dropped its demand for a rate rise. Shortly afterwards, Mr Mervyn King,
its chief economist, argued that the target would be satisfied if
inflation averaged 2.5 per cent or less over a long period. To
observers who had thought the authorities were supposed to be erring on
the side of caution - keeping inflation below 2.5 per cent except in
unavoidable circumstances - this looked like a loosening of policy.

But in a sense it was simply a recognition of the inevitable
limitations of inflation targeting. These limitations were demonstrated
by Andrew Haldane and Christopher Salmon, from the Bank, in a study
published last month*. They constructed a model of British inflation
since 1960 and reran history as though the authorities had pursued a
2.5 per cent inflation target by setting interest rates on the basis of
a forward-looking forecast.

The study suggested inflation would have been lower and less variable
had the authorities followed this policy, as the graphic illustrates.
But Haldane and Salmon also used the model to assess the possible
outcomes for inflation had the economy been buffeted by the whole range
of unforecastable outside disturbances which was typical of the period.
They concluded that even if monetary policy had always been well
directed, the authorities would have had only a one-in-four chance of
hitting a 1 to 4 per cent inflation target: 'Other things equal, these
results would argue for an inflation target band width at least as wide
as that operating in the UK - and possibly much wider.'

This study provides further evidence that it may be counter-productive
to express the inflation target as a range at all - be it 1 to 4 per
cent or 2.5 per cent and below. If the range were wide enough for even
a well-intentioned policymaker to be confident of hitting the target,
it would have to be so wide as to provide little gain in credibility.

Finland has recognised this problem and aims simply for inflation of 2
per cent. The Bank of Finland concedes that it would be impossible to
hit the target precisely in any given month, except by chance. But it
argues nonetheless that a single figure provides a better anchor for
private-sector expectations than a target range.

Mr King's comments and the Bank of England's advice this autumn suggest
that the authorities in the UK may be behaving as though they have a
point target for inflation slightly below 2.5 per cent - even though
that is not what the formal statement of the target says. If so, the
chancellor would do well to rewrite his target again so that it
reflects reality in a rather clearer way.

EMERGING MARKETS: HONG KONG - NEWS ROUND-UP


The Hong Kong stock exchange will review regulations on options trading
in the first quarter of 1996 and does not expect to launch new options
during the review period.

The review would cover the proposal that market makers should be exempt
from stamp duty when they conducted arbitrage with the spot market to
spread risks.

The exchange will also study changes to rules governing opening bids
and how to increase the number of market participants, including market
makers

The exchange began listing individual stock options in September and
currently trades options on nine stocks.

EMERGING MARKETS: INDONESIA - NEWS ROUND-UP


Further state asset sales, an updated legal framework and automation
could mean a bright start to the year for the Jakarta stock exchange,
brokers and analysts believe.

The exchange switched to a fully automated trading system from manual
operations in May, after long delays. This coincided with a move to new
premises in the central business district, and the extension of trading
by 90 minutes each session.

Brokers and analysts said the automated system had helped raise
efficiency and transparency and add liquidity. The fully automated
trading system would also provide a springboard for a planned move to
fully scripless trading, expected in the next few years.

The government is expected to list many of the more than 200 state
companies in the next few years.

EMERGING MARKETS: PHILIPPINES - NEWS ROUND-UP


The Manila equities market, which languished for much of last year, is
expected to rebound strongly during 1996 as more companies are listed.

The authorities expect the creation of a central depository, the start
of scripless trading and tighter rules to prevent insider trading to
boost sentiment.

Some brokers said they expected up to 30 companies to list.

However, inflationary pressures in the first quarter could be brought
about by an impending increase in domestic oil prices.

At present, about 200 companies are listed.

A central depository would begin operations for treasury bills and
government bonds in March before expanding to shares by the third
quarter of 1996.

EMERGING MARKETS:
TRADERS PIN HOPES ON DOLLAR - CURRENCY MARKETS

   By PHILIP GAWITH

If foreign exchange traders have their wishes granted, 1996 will be a
year of volatile markets. Last year was much better than the dismal
spectacle of 1994, but the last few months were characterised by the US
dollar trading in a very narrow range.

There is a fair amount of bullishness among currency forecasters about
the outlook for the dollar, though in recent years it has managed to
confound the best intended explanations for why it should rally.

Analysts at Lehman Brothers think that the dollar stands to benefit in
the coming months from: perceptions that inflation has become
structurally lower, a modest improvement in the current account deficit
as a proportion of GDP, and resolution of the budget negotiations.

They caution, though, that any rally could run into the buffers in the
second half of the year, which may be dominated by a turn-round in
German interest rate expectations.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs are also bullish about the dollar,
forecasting levels of DM1.55 and Y112 in the next six months. Against
the yen, their thinking is based upon trends in the trade and current
account data of both the US and Japan, which suggest that the big
bilateral balances between the countries are turning in the dollar's
favour.

Against the D-Mark, their thinking departs from the premise that the
German economy is suffering from the mis-alignment of the D-Mark in
Europe, and this will require the Bundesbank to ease monetary policy in
order to curb D-Mark strength.

Politics will be a key variable. US presidential elections will affect
the dollar, while the progress towards monetary union in Europe will
also be an important determinant of D-Mark and Swiss franc performance.
The proximity of elections in the UK, and a possible Labour government,
could make life difficult for sterling.

EMERGING MARKETS:
LOOKING AHEAD TO BRIGHTER PROSPECTS - THE EMERGING INVESTOR

   By JOHN PITT

The year just ended has not been one that investors in the world's
emerging equity markets will care to remember. Far better to look ahead
to the brighter prospects that many strategists believe beckon in 1996.

But there were some winners during 1995 - a year in which what have
become known as the 'pre-emerging' markets came into their own.

Take Jordan, for example, capitalised at less than Dollars 5bn (compare
this with Mexico's market capitalisation of about Dollars 90bn), and an
annual turnover estimated at less than Dollars 1bn. (Mexico has an
average daily turnover of at least Dollars 100m.)

A far sighted investor who took a position in the country's fledgling
stock market at the start of last year would have seen
dollar-denominated assets appreciate by 23 per cent. Compare this with
a loss of 35 per cent in both India and Hungary, or 40 per cent in Sri
Lanka.

Certainly one of the prominent themes of 1995 has been the growing
interest in these pre-emerging markets: countries which are just
beginning to organise their financial structures, but are endeavouring
to do so as quickly as possible.

As the main emerging markets of Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey,
for example, retreated in the face of a flow of funds back into the
developed world, so interest turned to lesser known regions. In
particular, a race began among a number of US and European investment
banks and brokerages to establish contacts and trading positions in
Africa. It became clear that in this 'new scramble for Africa' returns
on investments could, in many cases, far exceed those in the more
mature markets. But the risk would also be much greater.

This did not deter the launch of a number of African funds during 1995,
although most were naturally skewed towards the largest market on the
continent - South Africa. With an estimated market capitalisation of
Dollars 274bn Johannesburg is the world's seventh largest stock
exchange.

Russia was another growth area and some commentators believe that 1996
will see this market come of age, especially after the presidential
election is out of the way. ING Barings global strategy unit led by
Michael Howell, for instance, believes that both eastern Europe and
Russia show attractive valuation levels, and thinks fund managers are
ready to significantly increase their exposure.

'Of the Dollars 50bn expected to flow towards emerging equity markets
in 1996, I expect some Dollars 5bn to head towards eastern Europe and
Russia,' says Mr Howell. 'This is equivalent to more than 10 per cent
of existing market capitalisation, and, perhaps, as much as 25 per cent
of the existing free-float.'

Other factors likely to lift investor sentiment in Russia include an
improvement in custodial operations, with expectations that an
independent central depository will finally be created.

Mr Mark Mobius, president of the Dollars 7bn Templeton Emerging Markets
Fund, is another enthusiast for Russia, although he is aware that the
country's turbulent political climate is likely to get worse before it
gets any better.

Nevertheless, he is confident that potential for investment is bright,
given that the country has embarked on what he calls a 'revolutionary'
approach to financial market reforms.

But what of the core emerging markets?

Mr Arnab Banerji, chief investment officer of Foreign & Colonial
Emerging Markets based in London, believes that in spite of a
disappointing return on investments in 1995 the outlook remains
positive. He picks South Korea, India, Brazil and Taiwan, among others,
as having strong prospects.

India, for example, continues to have good compound earnings growth, he
says.

He is also among a number of strategists who favour Brazil among Latin
American markets.

Garantia, a leading Brazilian investment bank, warns that slower
economic growth during the first half of the year will put a brake on
the stock market's momentum; while for the year as a whole it will be
very much a matter of selecting specific sectors. Garantia favours the
food, beverage, packaging and retail sectors, on the basis that the
recent decline in inflation means that many people now have a
disposable income for the first time in years.

At UBS the emerging markets team is keen on Chile, South Korea and
Turkey, all for different reasons. Chile will continue to see an
improvement in the economic picture and political problems are forecast
to dissipate; South Korea is expected to benefit from an easing in
monetary policy; and Turkey should be able to move forward once again
now that the parliamentary elections are out of the way.

Chile will also benefit from the increased weighting - from 1.9 per
cent to 7.3 per cent - which the equity market will attract in the
IFC's investable index which starts this month. Mr Nigel Rendell at
James Capel, who classifies Chile as 'an Asian tiger living in Latin
America', forecasts that despite the recent rise in interest rates,
corporate earnings will rise by 25 per cent in nominal terms, valuing
the market on a prospective p/e of 16 times.

Whether or not this year will see a pick-up in activity among the
world's emerging markets depends on a host of factors, not least the
movement in US interest rates. Further easing in US monetary policy,
many analysts believe, could trigger a fresh wave of institutional
money out of the US and Europe, and into Latin America and the Far
East.

EQUITY MARKETS:
INVESTORS FACE A DEARTH OF ECONOMIC DATA - NEW YORK

   By RICHARD WATERS

Thanks to the latest Federal government shutdown, US stock market
investors start the new year facing a dearth of official economic data
against which to judge the economy's performance.

The only significant new information this week will be the National
Association of Purchasing Management report for December, due today.
The headline NAPM index for the month is expected by most economists to
be around 47.5 - higher than November's 46.5 but still below the
50-mark which would point to expectations of manufacturing growth. That
would provide a firm backdrop for the bond market, whose recent gains
have underpinned share prices.

While keeping one eye on bonds, the stock market will begin to fix its
attention on the corporate earnings season starting later this month.

Three months ago, a generally strong set of quarterly results helped
set the stage for the stock market's fourth-quarter rise. This time
around, the figures will be pored over for signs of how the US's
economic slowdown is affecting earnings growth.

Most market followers expect earnings growth to taper off during 1996.
But corporate cost-cutting and share repurchases have left plenty of
room for earnings to come in ahead of expectations. And with US
investors still buying mutual funds, there seems to be plenty of cash
around to chase share prices higher.

EQUITY MARKETS: STRATEGY - OTHER MARKETS


The start of the new year has brought the usual crop of recommendations
from brokers. Spain and Sweden feature among the lists as potentially
good performers in 1996 while the time may now be ripe to take profits
on Switzerland after its strong run last year.

Views on Italy are divided, with some analysts thinking the time is
right to give the market another chance but others finding the
political outlook still unappealing.

JP Morgan expects equity markets to remain volatile, with positive
responses to interest rate cuts probably offset in part by continuing
bad news on earnings.

Morgan reiterates its underweighting of Paris, saying France is
expected to experience one of the slowest growth rates in Europe next
year. It is taking profits on a previous upgrade of the Swiss market
and switching the money into Italy, which it believes is discounting
the bad news and could react positively to a relaxation of monetary
policy.

Morgan says the low valuation on its forecasts and scope for interest
rate cuts makes the Swedish market look attractive after its recent
underperformance.

Lehman Brothers still recommends being overweight in the Spanish,
French, Swedish and Dutch markets. It says the first two are cheap,
relative to debt, while slower French growth has been more than
discounted by the market.

Sweden looks attractive on a prospective dividend basis, while the
Dutch market is the cheapest among the core European economies.

The UK, Swiss and Italian markets remained relatively expensive.
Liquidity flows had helped the first two, but value would come through.
In spite of its underperformance, Lehman saw little value in Italy.

ABN-Amro Hoare Govett, meanwhile, continues to prefer Germany and the
Netherlands in core Europe while Spain is its peripheral market of
choice. And while Italy's valuations have improved, ABN still does not
trust the politics.

EQUITY MARKETS: TOKYO - OTHER MARKETS

   By EMIKO TERAZONO

With the Year of the Pig ending on a note of slight recovery, some
market participants are hoping that the Year of the Rat will be a good
one for the Japanese shares, writes Emiko Terazono. Past Years of the
Rat have seen the market rise by an average of 54.6 per cent, and the
animal is regarded by believers of traditional omens as a favourable
sign for investments.

Stocks may need all the help they can get since banks and life
insurance companies are expected to sell their share holdings ahead of
the March book-closing. Analysts point out that there has been heavy
trading around 21,500 and regard that figure as a strong resistance
level.

Further gains are expected among equities this week after Friday's
year-end window dressing and solid gains in the futures market, which
took the Hang Seng index to intra-day and closing highs for 1995.

Analysts are concerned, however, that the near-term outlook for
recently active newspaper stocks remains cloudy in view of their weak
earnings prospects. They add that the decision to relax conditions
governing the pre-sale of uncompleted flats will benefit developers,
although it will not have much stimulative effect on the local property
market.

EQUITY MARKETS: FRANKFURT - OTHER MARKETS


The Bundesbank meets on Thursday, but having cut key rates at its last
meeting, no action can be expected on the discount or Lombard rates
this week.

James Capel says the Bundesbank Council will wish to assess the impact
of the monetary easing on M3 and the real economy over some weeks.

The most interesting feature of the meeting was likely to be what the
council said about the repo rate.

'We would expect a fairly prompt return to a variable repo rate, which
is likely to drift lower over the coming weeks,' says Capel.

On the corporate front, analysts are expecting a let-up in the number
of new bourse listings in 1996 after last year's flood, although
November will bring the flotation of Telekom, Germany's telephone
monopoly, which is expected to raise DM15bn.

Companies raised a record DM8.5bn in new funds in 1995 from 20 IPOs,
including the listing of Merck, the drugs group, that was Germany's
largest post second world war stock offering, which raised DM2.4bn, and
the Adidas placement, which raised DM2.1bn.

EQUITY MARKETS: DUBLIN - OTHER MARKETS


Even after last year's performance, which saw the Irish equity market
climb by 20 per cent to end among the best performing markets in Europe
for the third successive year, Dublin retains its enthusiasts.

Mr Robbie Kelleher at Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin says the market has
more than doubled since the trough of October 1992 but still expects
the ISEQ to be among the top performing indices in 1996.

'Valuations remain low, both by historic and international standards,
the Irish economy is likely to be the fastest growing economy in in
Europe again in 1996 and the strength of corporate cash flows and
balance sheets is likely to restrict the supply of new equity to a
minimum,' he says.

How this better relative performance translates into absolute
performance depends on developments in other markets.

Mr Kelleher believes the international equity market rally can be
sustained in the early part of 1996, on the back of continuing support
from low interest rates, low inflation and rising bond prices.

EQUITY MARKETS:
YEAR EXPECTED TO OPEN ON POSITIVE NOTE - LONDON

   By PHILIP COGGAN

The UK market starts what could be a general election year in a healthy
spirit. A base rate cut in December, accompanied by reductions in
European and US interest rates, creates a positive background for
equities.

With most observers expecting base rates to fall further in the early
months of 1996, shares could yet set some more all-time highs. While
the FT-SE 100 index did well in 1995, it still lagged well behind Wall
Street's phenomenal performance.

The first test of the year will be the spring results season, not so
much for the figures themselves, but for chairmen's statements about
trading conditions in early 1996. The market shrugged off some profits
warnings in late 1995, mainly on the hope that UK economic growth was
pausing for breath, rather than grinding to a halt.

As the year moves on, thoughts will inevitably turn to the date of an
election, and the chances of a Labour government.

Concern will probably focus, not on macro-economic policies, but on
micro-economic matters such as the minimum wage or dividend taxation.
If Labour maintains its strong lead in the opinion polls, shares may
start to come under pressure.

Much went right for the UK stock market in 1995 - takeover activity, a
strong Wall Street, falling bond yields and worldwide interest rates.
It will be a surprise if all those factors are still as positive in
1996.

EQUITY MARKETS:
CVRD MANDATE SUGGESTS END OF THE GOLDEN 3% FEE - INTERNATIONAL OFFERINGS

   By ANTONIA SHARPE

The debate about fees which investment banks charge for arranging
international equity offerings is set to be a lively one in 1996,
judging from the aggressive bids which emerged in the recent
competition to win Brazil's Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) mandate.

Shortly before Christmas, the Brazilian government said it had chosen a
consortium including Merrill Lynch, NM Rothschild, KPMG and four
Brazilian partners to handle the sale of its 51 per cent stake in CVRD,
one of the world's largest exporters of iron ore.

The winning consortium is charging a fee of 1.9 per cent to arrange
what is expected to be one of the most significant international equity
offerings of 1996. According to market valuations, the government's
stake is worth about Dollars 5bn but the sale is likely to be spread
over at least two offerings.

If the winners' fee looked low, it was by no means the lowest. Bankers
involved in the bidding said a consortium led by Lehman Brothers had
offered to do the business for a fee of 1.75 per cent and another
including CS First Boston for 1.9 per cent.

It is also believed the fee bid by the consortium including Morgan
Stanley and SBC Warburg (disqualified because the first part of its fee
estimate was too far below the average) was in this region.

By contrast, Goldman Sachs, which had come top in the technical part of
the bidding contest, had bid a fee of 3.125 per cent, bankers said.

Bankers involved in the consortium which won the CVRD mandate say the
level of the fee was justified because the sale will be a secondary
offering and not an initial public offering, which usually commands a
higher fee.

Half of the CVRD stock is already traded, making CVRD the most
widely-held stock after Telebras and Petrobras. As a result, it already
has a wide following among foreign analysts and investors.

They also point out that there is a history of low fees in Brazil,
where past international equity offerings have been done for fees of
just over 2 per cent. But the two most important reasons bankers give
to justify the fee are: first, the size of the offering; and second,
the importance of being involved in the first of many privatisations in
Brazil.

Although bankers do not expect the government to sell its CVRD holding
in one go, the arranging banks stand to earn close to Dollars 100m from
the whole process.

On the second point, the bidding highlighted the willingness among
international banks to drop their fees in order to be at the forefront
of Brazil's privatisation programme.

The government wants CVRD to pave the way for further sell-offs in the
country's electricity and telecommunications sectors over the next few
years.

The fact that three leading investment banks were willing to arrange
the CVRD sale for a fee of less than 2 per cent, despite the risks
associated with an emerging market such as Brazil, is also a reflection
of the increasingly intense competition in the international equity
market.

Once one of the most lucrative sectors of investment banking, fees for
arranging deals, particularly privatisations, have been eroding
steadily over the past two years.

This has come about as governments seek to maximise the proceeds of
selling off state assets and new players try to break into the market.

The downward pressure on fees has been mainly on privatisations, where
there is likely to be follow-on business for the banks, and less so on
corporate IPOs or secondary offerings. However, there are signs that
corporate fees are also coming under pressure.

In view of the ever-greater number of privatisations in Europe and
elsewhere in the world and the growing number of investment banks
wanting a slice of the action, it is inevitable that fee levels have
become one of the main bargaining tools.

With competition set to stiffen further, many bankers now believe the
golden 3 per cent level, once the norm for European privatisations, has
gone for good.

GOLDMAN SACHS REMAINS AT THE TOP

   By ANTONIA SHARPE

Goldman Sachs maintained its position as the leading global co-ordinator
of international equity issues in 1995, according to data from Euromoney
Bondware, Antonia Sharpe writes.

Goldman's involvement in Germany's
privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, scheduled for November, should ensure
it retains the top slot in 1996. However, winning the CVRD mandate in
Brazil, which is also set to emerge in the second half of the year, has
increased Merrill Lynch's chances of taking the lead.

Although Morgan
Stanley, Merrill Lynch, SBC Warburg, CS First Boston, Dresdner
Bank-Kleinwort Benson and Lehman Brothers remain among the top 10 global
co-ordinators for 1995, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, Paribas and BNP have
been displaced by UBS, ABN-Amro and BZW.

WORLD BOND MARKETS:
TOKYO

   By EMIKO TERAZONO

While the country's financial institutions' woes are likely to prompt
the Bank of Japan to maintain an accommodating stance in its money
market operations, it is expected to push up interest rates on the long
end.

Banks are expected to step up their profit-taking on bonds and stocks
ahead of the March book-closing in order to cover losses stemming from
the write-offs of bad loans.

Many of the leading banks have pledged to clear their balance sheets of
bad loans related to jusen, or housing loan companies, and some have
announced that they may fall into the red for this business year to
March.

Life insurance companies may also want to take profits on their bond
holdings due to the decline in insurance premiums. While the leading
insurers posted healthy rises in their recurring profits for the first
half to September, this was largely due profit-taking on their
investments.

The seasonal repatriation of funds from the US ahead of the March
book-closing may briefly put upward pressure on the yen on the foreign
exchanges, but this is unlikely to have a lasting impact on bond
prices.

Lehman Brothers in Tokyo estimates yields on the 10-year government
bond, which closed the last year at 2.9 per cent, to end at 3.4 per
cent at the end of the first quarter of this year.

WORLD BOND MARKETS:
A STEP AWAY FROM CITY TRADITION - OPEN GILT REPO TRADING

   By PHILIP GAWITH and RICHARD LAPPER

The launch today of the open gilt repo market may be something less
than a 'second Big Bang', but it does represent a further step away
from a City where custom and tradition have played an important role,
towards one governed by the more homogenised standards of a global
financial services industry.

The privileges and arcane idiosyncracies associated with such core City
institutions as gilt edge market makers (GEMMs) and stock exchange
money brokers (SEMBs) are ebbing away.

Already there is evidence of some of the more marginal GEMMs throwing
in the towel, while SEMBs will have to cope with the fact that an open
repo market comes in tandem with an open stock-lending market.

Ironically, the advent of the gilt repo market is being
enthusiastically welcomed by that other supposed City anachronism - the
discount house. These institutions have, for as long as anyone can
remember, served as the intermediaries through which the Bank of
England channels liquidity to the commercial banks.

Often the butt of ridicule for their quaint practice of having
employees don top hats every morning in order to do the rounds of the
City's main banks, they have also become increasingly marginalised in
recent years as the clearing banks have gained ascendancy in the money
markets.

More than 80 per cent of the eligible bills - those which the Bank is
prepared to discount in its daily money market operations - are held by
the clearers.

As a result, the role of discount houses over the past 10 years has
been little more than to serve as brokers on behalf of the clearing
banks.

There is a widespread belief, however, that the Bank of England will
start to use the repo as its daily medium of intervention in the money
markets (at the moment it conducts repo operations every two weeks, but
the bulk of its daily operations are done through the bill market).

This will not be immediate - the Bank will first want to see a depth of
liquidity in the repo market, both in terms of the number of
counterparties, and the volume going through - but is believed to be
inevitable.

For its part, the Bank is playing a very straight bat. It said this
week that 'it did not have plans to change the form of its money market
operations', but that the development of gilt repo trading 'could make
it sensible to contemplate change later'.

The Bank has to tread very carefully, because, in the words of one
observer, 'any change is a sea change'.

A hint that the Bank plans to start using repo alongside eligible bills
in its daily operations is sure to be taken as a signal that a move to
sole reliance on repo is likely.

Some observers believe the Bank will try to run repo and bill
operations in tandem.

There are two main reasons why such a move is considered likely. First,
there is widespread belief that intervening via the repo will be a more
effective method of managing short-dated interest rates than the
current practice of intervening, often three times a day, via the bill
market.

Second, it seems most likely to be the modus operandi of a future
single European central bank and the UK is unlikely to want to do
anything which is at odds with what it might have to do in Europe, if
it participates in monetary union.

A study last year by Mr Norbert Schnadt for the London Business School
found that the money market operations of the Banque de France,
Bundesbank and Federal Reserve differed from those of the Bank of
England in that they were conducted less frequently, utilised only
repurchase transactions, and were spread over a very wide range of
financial institutions.

It also found that even though the Bank intervened more frequently in
the money markets than the other central banks, sterling rates were
much more volatile than elsewhere.

Recently, however, UK overnight rates have been steadier. Intervention
via repo is also unlikely, in itself, to be sufficient to make
overnight rates more stable.

Any shift towards daily use of repo will be welcomed by the discount
houses, because by so doing the Bank will increase the number of active
participants in the money markets, diminishing the dominant role of the
clearers.

The introduction of an open repo market also creates a new trading
instrument which puts more emphasis on the idea of secured money - a
high priority in the aftermath of the Barings episode.

At the moment, most secured lending and borrowing is done either to the
discount market, or via SEMBs, and through them to GEMMs.

Discount houses see an opportunity in this because of their expertise
in secured lending.

Mr George Blunden, chief executive of Union plc, says: 'Discount houses
have a head start because our job has been secured money markets since
the beginning of time.' As much as 95 per cent of the discount market
is secured.

Mr Ross Jones, chief executive at Gerrard and National plc, adds: 'This
is the biggest opportunity we have had for years. We see it as a
potential new lease of life for the secured sterling money market.'

A group like Gerrards has the added advantage of having a SEMB within
the group, which will be merged with the discount house operations.
While the pivotal role of SEMBs will be diminished, stock borrowing and
lending will continue, alongside repo, so the relationships they have
will still count.

A number of the largest holders of gilts - pension funds and
institutions - have dealt exclusively with SEMBs, and early indications
are that they will be happy to continue doing business this way.

As new entrants garner market share, institutions will have to widen
their counterparties beyond the small set of SEMBs they have
traditionally dealt with, but loyalty to old relationships looks likely
to be the watchword initially.

Discount houses are also confident that if the Bank of England starts
to use the repo as an intervention mechanism, it will want a manageable
set of counterparties, dedicated to making markets in all conditions.
They believe that their chances of playing this role are good.

Another development which will encourage the development of the repo
market is the introduction of the European-wide Capital Adequacy
Directive, which also takes effect today. CAD encourages a secured
money market, because the capital requirements for repos are much lower
than for unsecured ones.

WORLD BOND MARKETS:
FRANKFURT

   By ANDREW FISHER

The German bond market market ended the year quietly but positively,
with bund futures generally expected to remain firm.

Inflation, now below 2 per cent, is clearly under control and economic
growth is modest at best. Thus the Bundesbank can sit tight after its
pre-Christmas interest rate cuts.

With the discount rate now down to 3 per cent, the chances of a further
reduction are rated as no more than slight by most economists.

It has only once fallen below 3 per cent in the last three decades -
just after the 1987 stock market crash, when it stayed at 2.5 per cent
for six months.

Mr Holger Fahrinkrug, an economist at Union Bank of Switzerland, said
the discount rate was not likely to fall so low in this cycle.

'However,' he added, 'this does not mean that monetary easing is over.'

The securities repurchase (repo) rate should fall below the current
3.75 per cent. Also, the 5 per cent Lombard rate could also be lowered,
since the bottom of previous cycles has seen it at 4 or 4.5 per cent.

If the money supply remains weak, the Bundesbank could cut interest
rates further, said Mr Bill Smyth of BHF Trust. But the 1987 discount
cut to 2.5 per cent did not produce a powerful bond rally, he noted.

WORLD BOND MARKETS:
LONDON

   By CONNER MIDDELMANN

All eyes in the UK government bond market this week will be on gilt
sale and repurchase agreements, or repos, which starts today.

'A whole new world of leverage trades, reverse repos, term stock loans,
buy/sells, matched books and, hopefully, very little mayhem will
transform the gilt market,' say analysts at HSBC Greenwell.

'We are entering a new evolutionary phase in the market. Repos will
impact on pricing, liquidity management, swaps, curve plays and
ultimately, we suspect, on official intervention in the money market.'

But in the near term, trading is unlikely to be heavily affected by
repos and after trading in a narrow range last week, gilts will have to
look elsewhere for life to be breathed back into the market.

The data front offers slim pickings, with M0 figures and the purchasing
managers' report for December scheduled as the only releases this week.

'M0 will be viewed with interest for what it reveals about consumer
demand in December - a month which accounts for over one-quarter of
total annual retail sales,' notes Mr Nigel Richardson of Yamaichi
International. 'The weekly notes in circulation data suggest that there
was a seasonally adjusted increase in M0 of almost 1 per cent on the
month - this would appear to confirm retailers' reports of strong sales
in December.'

INVESTORS ASSESS THEIR STRATEGY FOR 1996 - GOVERNMENT BONDS

   By RICHARD LAPPER

The scale of the rally in international government bonds over the last
six months surprised the markets and left many investors scrambling to
increase their exposures.

In assessing their strategy for this year, investors must weigh up the
extent to which benign economic fundamentals, especially for the US and
European markets, are already reflected in valuations.

At the same time, the markets could be affected by a number of
political uncertainties linked to the US presidential elections and the
creation of European Monetary Union.

European bonds provided investors with some of the best returns in 1995
- with returns (in local currency terms) to December 15 ranging from
around 15.3 per cent in France and 15.5 per cent in Germany to 19.3 per
cent in Sweden.

Over the last few weeks there has been a wealth of evidence that the
growth of core economies such as Germany and France is grinding to a
halt and that inflationary pressures are continuing to ease.

Furthermore, at their Madrid summit last month European leaders and
finance ministers reaffirmed their commitment to monetary union,
suggesting the reduction of fiscal deficits will remain a priority for
governments across the continent.

'Europe is shaping up for a common currency and that suggests
governments will wrestle to bring public finances under control. These
are developments bond investors will be pleased to see,' says Mr Craig
Shute, bond analyst at Bear Stearns International in London.

Similar 'bond-positive' forces are visible in the US, where Treasuries
provided investors with total returns of more than 17 per cent in 1995.
And the current market rally has very different characteristics to that
of 1993, which gave way to a sell-off early in 1994.

During 1993, the markets were expecting further monetary tightening -
now by contrast, further cuts in interest rates are expected. The
inflation rate is falling - it was rising in 1993 - and some analysts
argue that investors have yet to fully adjust their expectations to the
extent of the downward trend in inflation.

Mr Nigel Richardson, international bond strategist at Yamaichi
International, says US inflation - as measured by the consumer price
index - has not been as low as its current level of 2.6 per cent since
1972. The present situation 'holds out the possibility that there may
be a permanent return to 1960s-style price increases,' suggests Mr
Richardson.

Yet according to the a survey of economic forecasts by Consensus
Economics Inc, investors expect US inflation to rise to 3.1 per cent in
the longer term.

'They are responding fully to the current inflation background on the
grounds that they appear to doubt it will be maintained. In essence,
therefore, the bond market has 1980s style yields against a background
of 1960s style inflation,' says Mr Richardson.

However, there are also good reasons to be cautious. For a start, the
scale of the surge in bond prices in 1995 means much of the good news
is already reflected in valuations.

Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds fell by nearly two percentage points
in 1995, touching 6 per cent by the year end, while in Germany yields
on 10-year bonds had dropped to 6.07 per cent by December 27, a fall of
more than 1.5 per cent.

'With the US and European central banks virtually moving as one to cut
interest rates before year-end, most of the good news for the bond
markets has been delivered,' says Mr Graham McDevitt, international
bond strategist at Paribas Capital Markets.

Mr McDevitt predicts an increase in volatility, arguing that there is a
high risk of a correction in the first quarter with bond yields rising
by 25 to 50 basis points. Economic slowdown could also create
difficulties by undermining fiscal deficit and debt reduction schemes,
in turn putting at risk the achievement of Maastricht criteria for
monetary union in some countries.

The impact of the slowdown will be most clearly apparent in France,
where a fall in tax revenues could impair the government's efforts to
reduce its fiscal deficit from the current level of more than 5 per
cent.

The industrial action by French railway workers last month is expected
to have reduced growth in the final quarter of 1995 to 0.1 per cent.

Finally, while leverage has been an element of the current bull market,
it is not thought to represent as serious a threat to the markets'
stability as in 1994, when highly geared trades built up in 1993 were
suddenly unwound, aggravating the extent of the sell-off.

A popular geared play last year, according to analysts at BZW
Securities, was to finance purchases of US assets with yen borrowings
on the grounds that the 'perceived potential for currency loss is small
relative to the yield pick-up.'

BZW says the leveraging has been concentrated on US more than European
bond markets and may well be limited to the short end of the Treasury
curve, though 'the impact will still have percolated along the curve.'

WORLD BOND MARKETS:
NEW YORK

   By RICHARD TOMKINS

US Treasuries passed a milestone last week. On Wednesday, the yield on
the benchmark 30-year long bond ended the day below the psychologically
significant 6 per cent level for the first time in two years. On
Thursday and Friday, it edged down further still, closing the week -
and the year - at 5.94 per cent, in marked contrast to the 7.92 per
cent at which it started the year.

The question now is whether yields will fall further still, and Wall
Street analysts believe they will. Most indicators point to a weakening
of economic growth in the coming year, further diminishing inflationary
pressures.

With recession an increasing possibility, analysts confidently expect
the Federal Reserve to continue to reduce the Fed funds rate, with the
next downward movement pencilled in for the Federal Open Market
Committee meeting of January 30-31.

This week, however, could be a quiet one in the bond market, for any
agreement between the president and Congress over a balanced budget
will almost certainly come too late to allow the flow of government
data to resume before the weekend.

Most attention is likely to focus on today's publication of the
National Association of Purchasing Managers index for December. This is
expected to show a slight increase from November's 46.5.

FT GUIDE TO THE WEEK


UK gilt repo market opens

An open market begins in gilt repos, agreements to sell and then
repurchase government bonds. All players in the gilt market will be
allowed to borrow and lend stock, rather than only a select group of
dealers. The reform should provide greater liquidity, make the market
more attractive to foreign investors and reduce government funding
costs.

Cash for Marcos victims

About Dollars 50m (Pounds 32.4m) of money from Swiss bank accounts
belonging to the late Ferdinand Marcos, the former president of the
Philippines, is to be transferred to Hawaii. The move is part of a
Dollars 100m deal in settlement of a Dollars 2bn claim by about 10,000
victims - or their relatives - who were tortured, raped or murdered
under the Marcos regime. The Filipinos filed a lawsuit against Marcos,
who died in exile in Hawaii in 1989, after a popular revolt ousted him
from power in 1986.

AT&T targets Britain

UK phone-users can expect to find themselves the target of aggressive
campaigns by AT&T, the largest US telecoms operator. AT&T says it will
not compete on price but on quality of service and innovation. British
Telecom, which has so far brushed off challenges from its 150 or so UK
rivals, may have more to fear from the US giant.

Cricket

South Africa meet England in the fifth Test in Cape Town (to Jan 6).

Holidays

Armenia, Botswana, Canada, Japan, Korea, Liechtenstein, New Zealand,
Romania, Russia, Slovenia, Switzerland, Taiwan, Yugoslavia.

WEDNESDAY 3

Perry in Sarajevo

William Perry, US defence secretary, arrives in Sarajevo after
inspecting US bases in Italy and Hungary. Mr Perry is touring US
military operations to implement the Bosnia peace accord. It is the
first visit by a high-level US official since the deployment of 20,000
American troops began on December 16.

On Thursday, Mr Perry travels to Ukraine, where he and his Ukrainian
and Russian counterparts will participate in the destruction of an
intercontinental ballistic missile silo in accordance with the
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.

Summing up in Maxwell trial

The Maxwell fraud trial resumes following a Christmas break demanded by
the jury. The judge, Lord Justice Phillips, will start his summing up.
This is expected to last almost a week, after which the jury will be
sent out to consider its verdict. Kevin Maxwell, Ian Maxwell and Larry
Trachtenberg deny conspiring to defraud the Maxwell pension funds.

Holidays

Japan, Taiwan.

THURSDAY 4

UK's first war crimes trial

Committal hearings start in Dorking, near London, for what could be
Britain's first war crimes trial. The accused is 84-year-old Szymon
Serafinowicz, a former Nazi paramilitary allegedly involved in
atrocities during the second world war.

Japan's stock markets open

The Tokyo Stock Exchange and the country's other stock exchanges open
the year's trading session.

Holidays

Burma, Zaire.

FRIDAY 5

Britain's Blair in Far East

Tony Blair, leader of the UK's opposition Labour party, makes a two-day
visit to Japan on the first leg of a Far East tour (to Jan 8) to raise
his party's international profile and persuade foreign investors of the
soundness of Labour economic and financial policies. He will address
the Keidanren, the main business federation, and meet government
ministers and UK businesses in Japan. He travels on to Singapore.

German rail fares rise

Fares on Deutsche Bahn, Germany's federal railway system, rise an
average 2.8 per cent in western Germany. Train tickets in eastern
Germany, which used to be 20 per cent cheaper than in western Germany,
will now only be 10 per cent cheaper. The Schones Wochenende ticket,
which enables five people to travel unlimited mileage on local trains
for an entire weekend, will now cost DM35 (Dollars 25), up from DM30.

Mastering Management

The FT's 20-part series resumes in the UK edition with part nine,
following a two-week break. Non-UK readers can take out a subscription.

Holidays

Sri Lanka.

SATURDAY 6

Rifkind visits Hong Kong

Malcom Rifkind, UK foreign secretary, arrives in Hong Kong for a
three-day visit, his first to the colony as foreign secretary. He will
meet local business and political leaders and receive a briefing from
the governor, Chris Patten, on the state of Anglo-Chinese relations as
they affect the June 1997 hand-over of the colony. Mr Rifkind travels
on to Beijing.

Sailing

The Cape to Rio yacht race starts from Cape Town, South Africa.

exchanges of officers for training.

UK rail fares increase

British Rail and London Underground fares rise by varying amounts,
according to the route and service provider.

MEASURES THAT CAME INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY 1 1996

Public procurement deal

Public sector procurement contracts worth several hundred billion
dollars a year were opened to international competition when a new
World Trade Organisation accord came into force. The 24 signatories
include the 15 members of the European Union, the US, Canada, Japan and
South Korea.

US bill on lobbying

A ban on gifts for politicians in Congress came into force. Senators
can only accept gifts worth less than Dollars 50, with exemptions for
home-state products and foodstuffs. House of Representatives members
are allowed nothing, although there are 23 exemptions including
home-state products, T-shirts and baseball caps. Lobbyists must
disclose full details of their activities.

Italy holds EU presidency

Italy assumed the six-month rotating presidency of the European Union,
with the prime task of inaugurating the Inter-Governmental Conferences
(IGCs) on the future of the EU. The presidency risks being overshadowed
by Italy's political instability and a general election.

Lamberto Dini, prime minister, has argued strongly that he should
remain in office to ensure the government is able to concentrate on the
presidency.

Britain takes over WEU

The UK took over the presidency of the Western European Union, a
10-nation defence club. Britain has pledged to take a pragmatic
approach to upgrading the WEU, with some improvements in its capacity
to anticipate and handle crises but with no question of its
compromising Nato's role as Europe's main security institution.

EU-Turkey customs union

A customs union between the European Union and Turkey came into effect
with the removal of remaining trade barriers. This followed a vote in
the European parliament in December, in which the move was approved by
343 to 149, with 36 abstentions. There had been concern about Turkey's
human rights record.

EU finance directives

The EU Investment Services Directive, and the accompanying capital
adequacy directive, were both implemented. The directives aim to give
EU investment firms a 'passport' to trade in all member states if they
are authorised in one.

The CAD also introduces European Union-wide rules for banks and
securities firms to set aside capital to cover risks in securities
trading. These are in addition to international rules covering lending
risks run by banks.

Telecoms competition

Cable TV, utility, rail and other 'alternative' networks throughout the
EU were allowed to use their infrastructure to offer telecom services.
Mobile operators were permitted to build their own networks and
directly connect to other mobile operators.

French income tax rise

An additional 0.5 per cent tax charge was introduced on all revenues in
an attempt to correct the country's accumulated social security
deficit.

German tax changes

Tax cuts and other changes took effect which should leave Germans
nearly DM20bn (Dollars 13.8bn) better off this year. Tax-free
allowances were brought into line with poverty-level incomes, more than
doubling the level of income permitted before tax to just over DM12,000
a year.

Consumers will also benefit from the elimination of the 'coal pfennig',
which was previously added to electricity bills to help pay for the use
of German coal in power stations. However, these savings - amounting to
about DM27bn this year - will be offset partly by DM7.5bn higher
contributions to pensions and insurance funds.

Deutsche Telekom tariffs

Germany's state-owned telephone company, due for partial privatisation
later this year, introduced changes to bring its tariffs more in line
with market demands. Long-distance calls will become cheaper and local
calls, which have been kept artificially cheap for decades, more
expensive. Business clients can also choose from three different
discounts of up to 24 per cent.

British alcohol tax cut

The tax on fortified wine, such as sherry and port, was reduced by 12p
for a typical 75cl bottle.

UK copyright extended

Copyright on music and literature was extended from 50 to 70 years,
implementing an EU directive of October 1993. Although virtually all
member (and non-member) states adhered to the 50-year rule, the EU
followed Germany, where royalty payments last 70 years. Britain will
now be out of step with other English-speaking countries, which will be
able to produce cheap editions 20 years earlier.

The change is retrospective, bringing back into copyright works by
artists who died between 1925 and 1945, including the composers Edward
Elgar and Gustav Holst, and writers Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of
Sherlock Holmes, Kenneth Grahame, author of Wind in the Willows, Thomas
Hardy, Rudyard Kipling, DH Lawrence, and Beatrix Potter.

Income tax back in Cuba

Cuba, which abolished personal taxes as a 'capitalist evil' after the
1959 revolution, reintroduced income tax on hard currency earnings. The
government also introduced a tax on boats - whatever their size - and
road tolls on two highways leading to tourist centres.

SOCCER CLUBS IN EGYPT WINOVER TV FEES: GOVERNMENT PITCHES IN TO BOOST
ROYALTIES

   By JAMES WHITTINGTON

It was not quite the kind of negotiations Rupert Murdoch or Kerry
Packer might be used to, but for Egypt's football clubs earlier this
month it was quite something to score against the state television
monopoly.

Cairo's two most popular soccer teams last month banned state
television from broadcasting their matches after a row over royalties,
forcing the government to intervene in their favour.

The Egyptian government has long been ultra-cautious about allowing
market forces to unsettle the country's protected state sector. But
when it came to football, two senior ministers readily made the
necessary concessions.

In the Egyptian football calendar, the highlights of the season are the
matches between Cairo rivals Ahli and Zamalek.

These succeed in emptying the city's streets and push TV ratings way
past the most gripping soap operas.

Facing financial difficulties, the two teams astonished many Egyptians
by putting aside their rivalry on the pitch to take on the powerful
Radio and Television Union which for years has benefited from its
monopoly on domestic broadcasts by refusing to negotiate fees for
televising matches.

The clubs' financial problems began after the 1990 World Cup in Italy,
when the football federation urged clubs to turn professional and sign
contracts with players.

This led to fierce competition to sign the best footballers which
pushed up transfer fees and forced club directors to look more closely
at their finances.

In August, it became obvious that something had to give when Zamalek
paid a record EPounds 600,000 (Dollars 177,000) for Egypt's highest
goal scorer, Ahmed el-Kas.

'Faced with this kind of costs, to keep a first class team we had to
start thinking seriously about our finances,' explained Mr Adly
el-Kee'i, manager of Ahli.

'Before we just worried about winning our matches but suddenly we had
to think about our performance in terms of profits and losses. We
needed more income and the television rights seemed an obvious
candidate for change.'

At the start of the season in September negotiations between the soccer
clubs and the RTU on broadcasting fees were not going well.

The clubs complained that the fees, which are always paid to the home
side, were not only too low but also depressed gate earnings because
fans would stay at home to watch the matches live on television.
Demands for a better arrangement, however, were given short shrift.

'The (Radio and Television Union) is not a bank,' Mr Amin Bassiouni,
president of the RTU, was reported as saying. 'We are not responsible
for the soccer clubs' financial problems.'

On November 5, to break the deadlock, Ahli, the national champions,
took the unprecedented step of banning TV cameras from its matches.
Attendances rose three-fold, and the club said it earned more from gate
receipts than the previous television fee structure.

With the first goal scored, Zamalek quickly followed suit.

Caught offside and facing the wrath of Egypt's football fans, the
state-run broadcasters quickly called on the government to act as
referee.

The deputy prime minister, Mr Kamal el-Ganzouri, and the information
minister, Mr Safwat el-Sherif, were put on the case.

As the weeks went by and Ahli and Zamalek stayed off the screens,
football fans became more and more restless, with the local press
firmly in favour of the clubs.

With the pressure on, the RTU backed down, and the government stepped
in to provide the extra money.

A three-year contract which came into force on Saturday, will double
the clubs' earnings - EPounds 200,000 for matches between Ahli and
Zamalek and EPounds 150,000 for other matches.

'We're very, very happy, it shows we were right to stand up and fight,'
said Mr Ali Osman, chairman of Zamalek.

JAMAICA PONDERS AN ECONOMIC VICTORY OF SORTS

   By CANUTE JAMES

The custodians of Jamaica's truculent economy are celebrating a
victory, of sorts.

After 18 years of mainly acrimonious relations with the International
Monetary Fund, the island has ceased to be a borrowing member. With
foreign reserves covering three months of imports, government officials
are claiming that the new status with the IMF is a victory for the
administration's management of the economy.

Others are not so sure. The victory for Jamaica is pyrrhic, and the IMF
can claim a win in getting Jamaica to implement its structural
adjustment policies, say the government's critics. They point to
continuing currency instability and to billowing inflation. Businessmen
complain that high interest rates - a government tool for damping
demand and reducing pressure on the exchange rate - are driving them
out of business.

'After 18 years and being in a relationship with the IMF it must
reflect that we have managed effectively the macro economy,' said Mr
Percival Patterson, Jamaica's prime minister. 'I am not concerned
whether the IMF will claim some credit. My greater satisfaction is that
the economic situation is such that we do not need to borrow from them
and that we can take our own economic choices in accordance with our
sovereign judgments.'

There are no victors in this, said Mr Delroy Lindsay, president of the
Private Sector Organisation of Jamaica. 'This appears to be a draw.
Jamaica has made progress in structurally adjusting the economy, but it
still has a far way to go. Inflation is too high, interest rates are
too high and there is little growth.'

Jamaica's relations with the IMF is a litany of repeated and protracted
negotiations, agreements reluctantly implemented by successive
governments because they were politically unpopular. IMF agreements
became synonymous with the deterioration of the economy as governments
fulminated against the Fund's conditions for the structural adjustment
of the economy.

But the end to Jamaica's borrowing from the Fund has not coincided with
any indication that the persistently wayward economy is settling down.

After 18 months of relative stability, the currency has depreciated by
16.5 per cent since July after a decline in foreign currency flows to
banks. The central bank was forced to intervene by selling from its
reserves. Economic expansion has been sluggish at just under one per
cent in 1994. Mr Omar Davies, the finance minister, says 1995 is likely
to have resulted in more of the same. 'Growth will not be spectacular,
but it will be positive,' he said.

Mr Davies rejects suggestions that the economy is stagnant. 'We are
having lower levels of growth than we expected,' he said. 'This is not
stagnation but low growth.' The finance minister has done the
unthinkable in Jamaican politics by publicly admitting to making errors
which contributed to the current uncertainty in the business climate.

The prospects for Jamaica are limited and clear, economists and
business leaders concur. A reversal of the deregulation would be
damaging. 'The government has done well in the macro-economic policies,
but its management of some aspects has been inadequate,' said Mr
Lindsay. 'Interest rates must come down, the currency allowed to find
its own level, inflation will be lower and all other things will fall
into place.'

English police have reported an encouraging response in their search
for the murderer of French teenager Celine Figard, whose body was
identified at the weekend after being found by the roadside. She had
been missing for almost two weeks. After an emotional appeal by Ms
Figard's father, more than a thousand people called the police to offer

Interpol and police in southern England have been co-operating to find
a truck driver who offered the 19-year-old girl a lift at a service

OBSERVER: FOOD FOR THOUGHT


Hush. Egon Ronay, the Hungarian-born restaurant critic, has been
touring the eateries of Europe's four major international airports and
is not impressed. The great man, who penned The Unforgettable Dishes of
My Life, has collected more than enough material for a sequel.

Amsterdam's Schiphol comes bottom in Ronay's airport league table,
getting just one out of 10 for its catering quality. 'Anybody who eats
at Amsterdam airport needs to have his head and palate examined. It is
below criticism,' says Ronay. Paris's Charles de Gaulle is not much
better, scoring two out of 10. Frankfurt gets four out of 10, but Ronay
was still far from impressed.

Britain's Heathrow airport comes out tops, with the quality of its
chips and coffee getting a special mention. However, one word of
caution about the survey. Ronay was hired by the British Airports
Authority to undertake the exercise.

What's that they say about the customer always being right?

100 YEARS AGO: AMERICAN FINANCE


All the cables from New York reflect the feeling of relief which has
pervaded financial and commercial circles on the reported successful
negotiations for placing further Government bonds. Nothing could be
more significant than this of the low ebb to which the credit of the
United States has fallen. That it was a little better than had been
anticipated in some quarters after the publication of President
Cleveland's Message is not saying much. A workman who falls from a
scaffold may congratulate himself upon the fact that he has broken only
one leg instead of two, but the blessing is of the comparative order,
and the case of the United States is somewhat analogous to this.

50 YEARS AGO: MOTOR EXPORTS


The typical British car has limited passenger room, but is highly
suitable for British conditions, which are an amalgam of slow speeds,
short distances and smooth surfaces. But it is not, in itself, well
adapted for the vast spaces of continental travelling and the
roughnesses of colonial roads. Meanwhile, the mass-produced American
car meets colonial and continental conditions admirably.

COMPANY NEWS (THIS MONTH): PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH TO LEAD TO STRONG
EARNINGS - US RESULTS

   By MAGGIE URRY

US investors are looking forward to some good news this month as most
companies start reporting their 1995 earnings figures. Throughout the
year, the quarterly numbers have produced pleasant surprises, with
results often beating analysts' estimates, writes Maggie Urry.

Corporate America has gone through rapid productivity growth in recent
years, which has meant that even in 1995, with profits rising sharply,
companies were still laying off workers and taking large restructuring
charges.

Analysts prefer to look at the 'operating earnings', excluding one-off
charges. Forecasters expect the S&P 500 companies to announce earnings
per share totalling about Dollars 38 per share compared with Dollars 32
in 1994, a rise of nearly 20 per cent.

Particularly strong earnings gains are expected from cyclical sectors
such as aluminium, paper and pulp, and chemicals. Also well ahead will
be technology groups. However, some of these, such as semiconductor
makers, issued warnings on profits for the final quarter as sales
growth weakened and prices came under pressure.

Weaker figures are expected from some of the consumer non-durables
groups, such as the tobacco and restaurants sectors. In February, poor
results are due from retailers.

ARGENTINE CONGRESS URGED TO SPEED LAWS

   By MATTHEW DOMAN

   BUENOS AIRES


The Argentine government is stepping up pressure on the nation's
Congress to approve key economic legislation early in the new year.
Legislators failed to vote on two important measures in extraordinary
sessions held this week.

Debate on the measures - a presidential request for additional taxing
and budget-trimming powers and a bill to advance reform of
federal-provincial government relations - was again suspended late on
Thursday evening after opposition members of the lower house of
Congress withdrew from the chamber. Their walk-out denied the chamber a
quorum and pushed consideration of the bills into January.

The government is now insisting that extraordinary congressional
sessions be extended as far as February to win approval of the measures
it argues are critical to repairing the nation's finances in 1996.
Argentina's Congress normally takes a long southern summer recess over
the months of December, January and February.

The measure considered to be the most important is President Carlos
Menem's request for extraordinary powers to cut expenditure and raise
taxes without congressional approval. The government argues that the
proposed 'superpowers' are necessary to ensure that the 1996 budget is
balanced and International Monetary Fund fiscal targets are met.

The second major measure, the ambitiously titled Reform of the State
legislation, aims to streamline financial relations between the
national government in Buenos Aires and the country's 23 provinces.

The federal government argues that elimination of duplication of
services in the two tiers of government could save up to Dollars 1.5bn
a year but is reluctant to confirm that efficiency measures may see the
loss of up to 20,000 state sector jobs.

The congressional backlog was cleared somewhat earlier this week when
the upper house of Congress, the Senate, approved the 1996 budget law
and a hotly debated measure to increase taxes on tobacco products.

Argentine financial markets have maintained a firm tone in thin
holiday-season trade this week, and investors appear content to give
Congress some additional leeway to approve the government-sponsored
measures.

Economist Raul Buonuome of ING Barings said the markets were willing to
accept that the Senate might not sign-off on the measures until March
but had expected lower house approval this week.

ISRAEL HAILS 'CONSTRUCTIVE' ATTITUDE FROM SYRIANS

   By PATTI WALDMEIR

   WASHINGTON


Israel and Syria yesterday extended negotiations into the weekend as
the two sides took cautious steps towards peace in informal talks at a
secluded venue where they were able to start to form the sort of
personal relationships essential to any peace deal.

Each side sent three negotiators to the talks, held in the elegant
ambiance of the Aspen Institute's Wye Plantation conference centre
outside Washington.

Mr Uri Savir, director-general of the Israeli foreign ministry and a
crucial negotiator of the Israel-Palestinian peace accord, headed the
Israeli team. The Syrian chief negotiator is Mr Walid Moualem,
ambassador to Washington and a confidant of Syrian president Hafez
al-Assad. They were joined by four representatives of the US
government, whose presence is viewed by both sides as crucial to
mediate a deal. That team is headed by Mr Dennis Ross, state department
Middle East co-ordinator.

Convinced secrecy is essential to progress, all parties imposed a news
blackout. But an Israeli embassy spokesman in Washington stressed the
'positive atmosphere' of the talks.

'Very good personal contacts' were made, with negotiators from both
sides holding 'a lot of small talks' in the corridors and when they
dined together.

Given the intense distrust which exists between Israel and Syria any
improvement in the atmosphere must be progress. And Israeli sources
noted a new, more constructive attitude from the Syrians.

Analysts point out that the intentions of President Assad are
notoriously difficult to decipher, as he seldom travels to the west and
runs a closed and secretive government.

But they believe he may have concluded that the time is now ripe for
peace.

The assassination of Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin has
highlighted the strength of the anti-peace movement in Israel, which
may persuade Mr Assad that his best interests lie in making a deal with
the current Israeli government rather than having to deal with a
future, potentially more hostile one.

Mr Assad is also keen to remove Syria from the list of countries denied
certain economic benefits from the US because of their alleged support
for terrorism.

SUBSIDY WILL HAVE TO EXCEED DOLLARS 300M: NUCLEAR PRIVATISATION:
DECOMMISSIONING MAY LAST MORE THAN 100 YEARS

   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor

The government is likely to have to provide several hundred million
pounds for a special fund to pay for cleaning up nuclear power station
sites after next year's privatisation of the industry. The fund will
also have to be given tax-exempt status.

Advisers in the City of London are working on the structure of the
segregated fund which was announced earlier this month by Mr Tim Eggar,
the energy minister. The fund would be managed by an independent trust
to ensure money was available to decommission power stations over a
period that could last more than 100 years. The fund will have to be
endowed with an initial cash amount of between Pounds 200m (Dollars
312m) and Pounds 300m. This sum would be increased using earnings from
British Energy, the privatised company, to meet decommissioning
liabilities. However, contributions would come out of the company's
taxed income. So the trust itself would have to be exempt from tax to
avoid double taxation.

The size of the trust's liabilities is still being calculated. The fund
would be responsible only for long-term decommissioning - monitoring
sites while disused reactors 'cooled down' and eventually dismantling
them after 135 years. The larger costs of the first stage of
decommissioning a power station, including removal of spent fuel and
contaminated components, would be paid for by British Energy, which
would also bear the risk of a power station being shut down before
adequate provisions had been built up.

British Energy will also be directly responsible for disposing of spent
fuel, which represents the largest part of its total liabilities,
estimated at Pounds 6bn.

The initial finance for the fund could either be provided by the
government or raised through a loan from the private sector. But the
government has been told that it should provide the finance itself
because a loan would only reduce the potential sale price of British
Energy.

Another important decision will be the discount rate used to calculate
the size of provisions made by British Energy to meet its liabilities.
Present estimates have been based on the 6 per cent rate used by the
Treasury. The nuclear industry uses 2 per cent, which means that larger
provisions have to be made to reach the target.

The government's Department of Trade and Industry is expected soon to
publish details of the capital structure of British Energy.

SHOPPERS STABBED


A store worker ran amok with three knives yesterday and stabbed 10
people. The man marched through the aisles at the Netto store in
Bordesley Green in the English Midlands city of Birmingham, attacking
shoppers and staff. Two men and a woman were later stable in hospital.
Seven other people including a 13-year-old boy suffered less serious
wounds. A man was arrested outside the store by unarmed police.

OVERSEAS NEWS:
AILING KING FAHD HANDS OVER POWER TO SAUDI PRINCE: MOVE ENDS
SPECULATION OVER SUCCESSION BUT FUELS DOUBT ON RULER'S HEALTH

   By ROULA KHALAF, Middle East Correspondent

Saudi Arabia's King Fahd handed over the running of the government
yesterday to his half-brother, Crown Prince Abdullah, in a development
likely to raise further doubts about the king's health but end
speculation about succession in the kingdom.

A royal order carried by the official Saudi Press Agency said the
73-year-old monarch, who is believed to have suffered a minor stroke
last November, was handing over 'management of government affairs' to
the crown prince while he recuperates.

Prince Abdullah, who is two years younger than the king, is deputy
prime minister and head of the powerful 57,000-man National Guard. He
is seen as more conservative and less internationally minded than the
king, though diplomats said he was unlikely to change the kingdom's
foreign and economic policies.

Saudi Arabia is the world's largest oil exporter, and a close ally of
the US. The decree said the prince would take over while the king
enjoyed 'rest and recuperation'.

The decision makes official a role the prince has played since the king
fell ill.

Although he will officially now chair cabinet meetings and represent
the king on official visits, the move may prove temporary if the king's
health improves, diplomats said yesterday.

'It sounds more like a technical move, a kind of regency,' said one
diplomat in the kingdom. 'The king is still king. What we don't know is
how much he will still be involved and this will depend on his health.'

The king left hospital on December 8 after suffering what was
officially termed a 'sudden indisposition' but is known to have been a
stroke.

Diabetic and overweight, King Fahd was seen on television yesterday
aided by a walking stick as he received Crown Prince Abdullah and
Prince Sultan, the defence minister.

Saudi officials yesterday suggested the move was aimed at putting an
end to speculation of a power struggle within the kingdom.

The talk had been fuelled in recent months by two big shocks. The first
was the monarch's illness, the second a car bomb on November 13 which
destroyed a US-staffed Saudi National Guard communications centre in
Riyadh, the capital. the

Islamic fundamentalists opposed to the regime have latched on to these
events from their base in London and claimed a power struggle has
broken out in the royal family.

They viewed the bomb attack on the national guards as an attempt to
undermine Crown Prince Abdullah.

Yesterday's move preceded the unveiling of Saudi Arabia's 1996 budget.
Early indications suggested the kingdom would continue public sector
retrenchment, maintaining expenditures at SR150bn (Dollars 25.7bn), the
same as in 1995.

Faced with a cash crunch resulting from the collapse of oil prices and
the cost of the 1990-91 Gulf war, Saudi Arabia has since 1994 embarked
on a policy of cutting government expenditures and raising non-oil
revenues.

UK NEWS:
TORIES BRACED FOR MINORITY GOVERNMENT: SENIOR MINISTERS ADMIT MAJOR MAY
LOSE COMMONS MAJORITY BEFORE END OF 1996

   By JAMES BLITZ, Lobby Correspondent

Government ministers yesterday contemplated the probability that Mr
John Major will lead a minority administration later this year, amid
fears that the Conservatives can expect to lose more seats in the House
of Commons.

As left and rightwing Tories indulged in mutual recriminations over the
recent defection of Miss Emma Nicholson, MP for Devon West and
Torridge, to the Liberal Democrats, senior ministers privately admitted
that the government could expect to lose its Commons majority before
the end of 1996 - and that it may rely for survival on the support of
the nine Ulster Unionist MPs.

Ministers played down claims by one left-of-centre Tory that at least
six other MPs were prepared to defect to opposition parties. Yet
several admitted that by-elections triggered by the deaths of MPs would
put the Tories into a Commons minority this year. The departure of Miss
Nicholson means the government can now expect two pending by-elections
to cut its Commons majority to just one, if Sir Richard Body, who
remains outside the Tory whip, is excluded from calculations.

However, despite increasing signs that his party may have to rely on
their support in any No Confidence motion, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern
Ireland secretary, insisted there would be 'no special treatment' for
the UUP.

'I recognise no difference in the essential equation by reason of
events in the last few days or even a longer period,' he told BBC Radio
4's Today programme.

Other ministers, however, were already contemplating the need for
concessions to the UUP, with one privately conceding that relations
with the Ulster parties would be 'critical' to the government's
fortunes.

Calculations about the government's majority coincided with signs that
the delicate truce between left and rightwing Tories appeared to be
tottering in the wake of the defection.

Mr Michael Portillo, defence secretary, launched a strong attack on
Miss Nicholson, rubbishing her claims that the reason for her defection
had been the party's shift to the right.

'It is very silly to say that the party has tilted to the right - that
is completely incredible,' he told BBC radio. 'I think the party is
probably much the same. We have a broad breadth of opinion within the
party.'

Mr John Redwood, last year's beaten Tory leadership challenger, also
attacked the idea of a rightward shift by the government, claiming Mr
Major's cabinet reshuffle last July had promoted left of centre MPs.

However, Sir Edward Heath, former prime minister, rounded on Mr
Portillo, claiming the party had clearly taken an anti-European stance
and that Miss Nicholson's defection should be heeded. 'There is no
doubt at all that the party has moved to the right,' he said. 'That
can't be denied . . . it may be denied, but if it is denied it is a
false denial.'

Mr Peter Temple-Morris, a pro-European backbencher, also demanded a
halt to the 'torrent of personal abuse' heaped on Miss Nicholson and
called on ministers to rise above the warfare between the party's
wings.

'I would just like them to behave as if they were one cabinet, visible
for all to see and not in such a way where undoubtedly the unhappiness
produced has led to two defections in three months. We cannot afford
any more and I trust we will not have any more,' he said. Tory warning,

UK NEWS:
TAX SELF-ASSESSMENT WILL HIT SMALL BUSINESS, SAYS LABOUR

   By JAMES BLITZ

The Treasury's plan to allow self-employed managers of small businesses
to assess their own income tax liabilities will come under a strong
attack from the Labour party this week amid claims that it will add
significantly to company costs.

Labour claims self-assessment will place new burdens on small
businesses running into hundreds of millions of pounds. It estimates
the scheme will create extra recurrent costs of Pounds 130m to Pounds
250m a year for self-employed business managers and mean big increases
in red tape.

Mr Andrew Smith, Labour's shadow chief secretary, is also concerned the
scheme contains a 'hidden tax bombshell'. He said yesterday the
introduction of self-assessment later this year would increase the
Treasury's tax take by some Pounds 850m in 1997-98.

Labour is expected to raise its objections to the scheme in the Commons
on Thursday when the Finance Bill is published.

Mr Smith said the increase in tax revenue would occur because the
self-employed would make their assessments next year on the basis of
current-year activities rather than those for the previous year.

Because of anticipated increases in inflation and economic growth, the
change to current-year assessment would allow the Treasury to take more
in tax from the self-employed.

'While the principle of self-assessment makes sense, the way the
government is going about it on the current deadlines is a disaster,'
said Mr Smith.

He revealed that Labour would call for aspects of self-assessment to be
delayed to avoid confusion.

But Mr Smith would give no guarantee that Labour would abandon the
self-assessment plans, arguing that a new government might create new
difficulties by reversing changes of such magnitude.

A spokesman for the Inland Revenue confirmed that the government would
receive the additional Pounds 850m in 1997-98. But he said it was a
'one-off shift' that would not be repeated in future years.

'Overall, self-assessment amounts to a clearer system with more
definite deadlines - and one which people will find easier to operate,'
he said.

UK NEWS:
WALDEGRAVE GETS TOUGH ON SPENDING TO FINANCE TAX CUTS

   By ROBERT PESTON, Political editor

Remorseless pressure to bring down UK public spending to finance next
year's widely expected tax cuts has been promised by Mr William
Waldegrave, chief secretary to the Treasury, in a new year interview.

The chief secretary said he had a long-term aim of seeing public
spending fall to around 35 per cent of gross domestic product, compared
to about 42 per cent at present.

He said this should not be seen 'against the background of a slavish
target of numbers' but because of a 'genuine belief that too much is
done (by government) and a good deal of it is act-ually hindering the
economy'.

His views on the potential for shrinking the government's share of the
economy are strikingly different from those of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, who is not persuaded that there is scope to get the
proportion much below 40 per cent of GDP without damaging public
services.

There is also a significant difference between Mr Waldegrave and Mr
Clarke on European monetary union. Mr Clarke believes that the decision
to participate in a single currency is primarily an economic one.
However, Mr Waldegrave said the decision to join was primarily 'an act
of political will and choice'.

He also hinted that Mr John Major's successful campaign to persuade the
EU to study the implications of two-tier monetary union - with only a
small minority of countries joining the proposed single currency - is
motivated by a desire to delay the project.

'I do think that it is possible to imagine technical questions which
will be raised which will worry those who are going in very much,' Mr
Waldegrave said. 'The damage from a badly established union will be
quite considerable.'

The chief secretary also made it clear that he will contest any
criticism he may face in the Scott report on arms sales to

Iraq, due to be published in the next few weeks. Leaked drafts of the
report criticised Mr Waldegrave for failing as a Foreign Office
minister in the late 1980s to announce an apparent softening in the
government's policy on the arms embargo with Iraq.

Mr Waldegrave, who has made further submissions to Lord Justice Scott,
said: 'My conscience is entirely clear.' He would only consider
resigning if he could be persuaded that his 'memory of the whole
business is so wrong'.

He added that it would not only be his memory that was at fault but
that of 'the whole Foreign Office'.

On next year's public expenditure negotiations, he said he would start
visiting ministries with a view to securing cuts in the early spring.

One of the initial targets of his scrutiny will be the Pounds 15bn cost
to government of public bodies at arm's length from ministries and
quangos. He said he was looking for savings of several hundred million
pounds in their running costs. He will also maintain pressure on
spending departments to substitute private finance for
government-financed capital projects. 'In terms of extra cash flow
there is probably more to come from that,' he said.

His other target will be to step up the government's fight against
fraud, especially in the social security budget.

CHIRAC CONCEDES DIALOGUE NEEDED ON REFORMS

   By ANDREW JACK in Paris

   PARIS


Mr Jacques Chirac, the French president, made a sharp break with the
practice of his predecessor, Mr Francois Mitterrand, on Sunday night by
raising the political content of the country's traditional New Year's
Eve address from its head of state.

In an address lasting nearly 15 minutes and broadcast on most
television news channels, Mr Chirac devoted much of his time to
defending his decisions over the last few months and how they tied in
to his election campaign promises.

He made patriotic play of France's historical mission and global
importance, and its continued commitment to brotherhood, tolerance and
justice.

Referring to the widespread strike action since last November, which
was prompted by his government's proposed social security reforms, he
called the resulting period one of 'crisis'.

In his strongest statement of support for Mr Alain Juppe, he praised
the 'courage and determination' of the prime minister, as well as the
rest of the government.

However, in a sign of implicit criticism, he said that one lesson to be
drawn from the experience was the need for greater dialogue and
consultation - something which he acknowledged had not been
characteristic of France in the past.

Another lesson - in a jibe at his political predecessors - was that 'it
is no longer possible to govern as we have for the last 20 years' with
only piecemeal reforms. He stressed the need for a country able to cope
with 'global competition'.

He said his aim remained to build a 'new France' based on justice,
unity and resonsibility, and his top priority remained to reduce
unemployment - which remains at more than 11.5 per cent.

He placed less emphasis than in a previous television interview last
October on fiscal rigour, but talked about the need to set up a
creative, productive economy. He pledged that taxes - which have risen
since his election - would be cut as soon as possible.

President Chirac made time to discuss the French commitment to Europe -
a point brought home by the EU's flag hanging alongside that of his own
country on the wall behind him.

However, he also stressed the need for change in the administration of
the EU so that it was 'more attentive' to the daily needs of the
French, including their 'social hopes' and the 'real priority' of
employment.

OVERSEAS NEWS:
BEACON FOR EMERGING DEMOCRACY


Democracy can be a baffling business. In Soviet times, Russia's voters
could vote for only one party whose political philosophy was force-fed
to them from birth. In last month's parliamentary elections they had a
choice of 43 parties with each one claiming to have the only answer to
Russia's woes.

Such a drastic democratic upheaval has clearly left many Russians
bewildered and may help explain why more than one-fifth of them opted
for the familiar and voted for the return of the Communists. But the
elections also proved an education for Russia's political leaders who
are now scrambling to learn the lessons before the all-important
presidential elections scheduled in six months' time.

The Magnitogorsk Worker, the local newspaper for the Urals industrial
town founded as part of Stalin's industrialisation drive, encapsulated
many of the confusions and controversies that came to dominate the
campaign. In so doing it reflected, in microcosm, the social pain and
ideological uncertainties that continue to bedevil Russia.

The newspaper, founded in 1930 and still proudly bearing a Soviet
emblem on its front page urging the proletariat of the world to unite,
provided full, lively, and generally fair coverage of the campaign,
encouraging those who see the media as an important factor in the
development of a healthy civil society.

Like most of Russia's local newspapers, the Magnitogorsk Worker could
have been under enormous pressure from many quarters. The list of six
parliamentary candidates for the city seat included the deputy head of
the local administration and a director of the steel combine which
employs 60,000 workers and dominates the region's economy.

But Mr Georgy Tikhonov, the chief editor, argued that the newspaper's
role was simply to provide an objective forum for the debate and
encourage readers to participate in the vote. 'This newspaper does not
agitate for or against particular candidates. . . it agitates for
something else: for the widest possibility for people to discuss openly
one or another candidacy and the course of the campaign itself. Read,
think, and make your choice]' the newspaper stated.

In comparison with most western newspapers, the Magnitogorsk Worker
provided few reports and opinions from its journalists but carried
extensive personal contributions from the candidates and scores of
letters from its readers.

Mr Alexander Pochinok, the incumbent deputy who represented the then
pro-government Russia's Choice party in the previous vote in 1993, was
the dominant figure in the campaign for one of Russia's 225
directly-elected seats.

Although he supported the government's harsh monetary policies which
many critics blamed for Russia's social ills, Mr Pochinok boldly
launched his campaign by concentrating on social problems and promising
to improve the lot of the elderly.

But his attempt to seize the mantle of social concern was fiercely
contested by the Communist candidate who wrote an emotional tirade
against the government's policies and promised a restoration of the
certainties of the Soviet era.

These themes were echoed in the opinions of the newspapers' readers who
expressed impassioned and disparate views.

'During the war, millions were evacuated here and resettled. They were
given work and a roof but now they have been thrown out. Every honest
person will vote for the Communists,' said one.

'I do not want to return to the miserable plague-stricken camp of the
past but I fear the thorny road forward to civilisation,' commented
another.

One reader planned not participate in the elections at all given they
were merely a 'political spectacle distracting the country from its
true problems' while another con demned the newspaper itself for giving
too much space to the 'so-called democrats'.

The Magnitogorsk Worker made clear it was aware of some dirty electoral
tactics during the campaign but did not identify who was responsible
for them in order not to prejudice opinions. In the week before the
vote, it carried an item about a pensioner who had been contacted by
someone claiming to represent the local telephone company. 'Vote
correctly and your telephone bill will be paid in advance for a year,'
the mysterious caller promised.

On the eve of the elections, the newspaper urged its readers to go to
the polls although it recognised that many voters were still confused
by the extraordinary range of parties on the ballot paper.

The results were slow to trickle in and the Magnitogorsk Worker did not
publish the preliminary outcome until three days after the poll. The
electors of Magnitogorsk had returned the pro-market Mr Pochinok as
their local candidate but they had also lodged a strong protest vote
backing Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic
party and the Communists in the simultaneous ballot for the seats
assigned on the basis of proportional representation.

In all, 39 parties - including Russia's Choice - failed to garner more
than the 5 per cent of the vote required to win any of the 225 seats in
the 450-strong parliament allocated by proportional representation. Mr
Pochinok, for example, has been elected as a representative of a party
which will be unable to form its own faction in parliament.

One voter told the newspaper: 'Voting is most democratic. But you must
write that Hitler also came to power in Germany by democratic means. We
must go forward to the presidential elections but people must be
vigilant.'

SCALFARO SEEKS CLARITY ON POLLS

   By ROBERT GRAHAM in Rome

   ROME


President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has appealed to Italy's political
parties to come forward with clear ideas on how long the government of
Mr Lamberto Dini should last and to give a firm calendar for the life
of the current parliament.

The head of state's appeal was contained in his annual message
delivered on New Year's eve.

The highly political message was delivered in advance of this week's
meeting of the parliamentary group leaders to fix the terms of a debate
on the future of the government following the resignation tendered last
Saturday by Mr Dini, the prime minister.

As expected President Scalfaro rejected the resignation, insisting
parliament must decide. In his message, President Scalfaro reinforced
this point. 'In a few days the debate in the chamber of deputies will
provide the right opportunity to know precisely what the various
political groups want and to see whether a consensus emerges that is
both clear to the general public and useful to the head of state.'

The debate is likely to be staged next week, allowing further time for
the political leaders to negotiate behind the scenes. Until now none of
the main political parties has come forward with a proposal either for
the continuance of the Dini government or a date for general elections.

But Mr Dini, who has been in close touch with the main party leaders,
appeared confident over the weekend that he would remain in office.
Backed by President Scalfaro, he has argued strongly that the country
cannot afford a government crisis and a general election during Italy's
six-month presidency of the European Union which lasts until June.

Despite underlining the importance of parliament, the tone throughout
President Scalfaro's 35-minute New Year's message was of a man who
intended to use his limited constitutional powers to the full. He made
his own preferences plain.

He went out of his way to praise the 11 month premiership of Mr Dini -
so indicating his desire to see the former deputy director of the Bank
of Italy remain at the helm during Italy's EU presidency. He also said
he would like to see the current legislature carry out a proper reform
of the constitution in time for the celebration in 1998 of the 50th
anniversary of its introduction. This was seen as a none too subtle
hint that parliament should not be dissolved before institutional
reform has been tackled.

Yesterday several political parties took exception to what they
regarded as President Scalfaro's overtly partisan stance. In particular
the president's message was attacked by the rightwing National
Alliance, by the Greens and by Reconstructed Communism, which was
formed from the hardline members of the former Communist party.

PARTIES WEIGH UP RISK AND RESPONSIBILITY

   By ROBERT GRAHAM

Political decisions in Italy are rarely made in a hurry.

No one wishes to assume the responsibility - and risk - of the first
move. This is why the politicians will take their time in deciding the
fate of Prime Minister Lamberto Dini's government even though they have
had ample notice of the administration's limited duration.

Mr Dini tendered his resignation on Saturday to President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro, after approving an additional financial package for the 1996
budget. This was his last self-appointed task.

President Scalfaro has now thrown the responsibility back to parliament
to decide what should happen next. This will take the form of a
parliamentary debate later this week or early next week.

Having acquired a taste of power over the last 11 months, Mr Dini is
more than willing to stay on. Moreover, President Scalfaro, who has the
final say on a date for the next general election, is clearly anxious
the former director general of the Bank of Italy should remain in
office.

President Scalfaro believes it is too late for a big political shake-up
now that Italy has the responsibility (since January 1) of the
presidency of the European Union. He thus wants Mr Dini to remain prime
minister - probably with a revamped cabinet - for the duration of the
six-month presidency. But this seems to be part of a broader strategy
by Mr Scalfaro, a former Christian Democrat interior minister, to allow
parliament to survive until 1997, thus permitting more time for a
recreation of the centre grouping which dominated post-war Italian
politics until 1992.

The parliamentary debate is expected to focus on three broad scenarios:

* Mr Dini heads the government to ensure a stable EU presidency and
permit elections around June.

* Mr Dini presides over a caretaker government with elections held in
late February or early March.

* A broad-based government is formed lasting up to two years to permit
a programme of big institutional reforms.

The first scenario involves several variations. For instance, Mr Dini
could seek to maintain the backing of the centre-left parties, headed
by the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) who supported his government
of non-parliamentarians all last year. This would provide a fragile
majority in parliament unless a prior understanding was reached with
the rightwing alliance headed by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime
minister. The government would be little more than a caretaker, while
the parties indulged in a six-month election campaign.

Alternatively Mr Dini, who has no political base of his own, could try
to broaden the backing for the government to include the small centre
parties in the rightwing alliance. This would have the advantage of
lessening the exposure of the centre-left as the government's main
backer and would provide some chance of parliament pushing through a
few reforms in the next few months. It would also help offset the
destabilising effect of the populist Northern League, which, with
almost 80 deputies, retains considerable power to swing votes.

The second scenario is straight-forward and would mean parliament being
dissolved shortly after the debate on the government's future. Mr Dini
would remain in office but with no real executive power. Given that it
normally takes a good six weeks to two months to form a government
after an election, Italy would be without an effective administration
probably until May.

The third scenario is the most complex. At a minimum it would require a
commitment from the PDS, some of the centre parties and the bulk of Mr
Berlusconi's rightwing alliance to back the idea of carrying out over
the next two years important institutional reforms such as
strengthening the prime minister's position and ending the duplication
of the bicameral system. This would be done either by allowing a
'technical' government to continue as the executive while a special
bicameral commission was formed to draw up the reforms; or a new
government would be formed, drawing ministers from the parties
supporting it. The onus would then be on the government to draw up the
reforms.

Mr Berlusconi has been exploring this idea of a broad-based government
over the Christmas break. His scheduled trial later this month for
corruption probably played a part in his change of mind. But the PDS is
sceptical of his chances, and the rightwing National Alliance (AN), his
main ally, is openly hostile to the idea. The parties themselves are
changing too fast for a broad-based alliance to survive and be useful.

The PDS has the power to force elections simply by refusing to continue
backing Mr Dini; but of late Mr Massimo D'Alema, the party leader, has
dropped his insistence on an early vote. This is because the
PDS-dominated centre-left is increasingly divided on strategy and beset
by doubts about being led in an election by the uncharasmatic Mr Romano
Prodi, the Bologna academic and former head of Iri, the state holding
company.

The centre-left staked much on striking an electoral deal with a
movement headed by Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the former Milan magistrate.
But Mr Di Pietro may now be prevented from entering politics because of
his own problems with the law that have arisen as aresult of
investigations over his abuse of office before he joined the Milan
magistrates' anti-corruption team.

Against this background, the simplest option for the political parties
is to allow Mr Dini to stay with the excuse that Italy needs an
identifiable government to play its full role as EU chairman. This is a
convenient fig-leaf behind which the politicians can hide their
confusion. But it will merely postpone the day of reckoning at the
ballot-box and is unlikely to provide an authoritative government, even
if Mr Dini has proven to be a skilled and ambitious operator of the
system.

SAMPAIO LEADS AS PORTUGAL NEARS VOTE

   By PETER WISE in Lisbon

   LISBON


Campaigning for Portugal's presidential election on January 14 began
this week with Mr Jorge Sampaio, the Socialist candidate, showing a
clear lead over Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister for 10 years
until his centre-right Social Democrats were beaten in October's
general election.

Mr Sampaio, a former Socialist party leader who stepped down as mayor
of Lisbon to run for the presidency, was given 41.6 per cent of the
vote in a newspaper poll yesterday, compared with 34.9 per cent for Mr
Cavaco Silva. A weekend poll based on a broader sample of more recent
interviews gave them 50 per cent and 34 per cent respectively.

Since the return of democracy in 1974, Portugal has consistently
elected presidents from the party opposed to the government so that
each acts as a counterweight to the other. Mr Cavaco Silva says that
Portugal will 'capsize' if all political weight is shifted to the
Socialists, who are also dominant in local government.

However, the polls indicate that most voters are inclined to provide
additional support for the Socialists, who are four seats short of a
parliamentary majority, by electing Mr Sampaio. Under Portugal's 'semi-
presidentialist' constitution, the president has the power to dissolve
parliament and call an early election when governments run into
difficulties.

Mr Antonio Guterres, the prime minister, is campaigning for the backing
of a Socialist president. This would help his minority government meet
election commitments both to spend more on social reforms and exercise
the budgetary discipline required to meet the convergence targets for
European economic and monetary union.

Ministers say Mr Cavaco Silva would seize the first opportunity to
dismiss the government if he won the election, although he has pledged
to co-operate fully with the Socialists in the interests of stability.

The former prime minister's attempt at a transition from an aloof
decision-maker to the kind of benevolent figure of tolerance and
concern that Mr Ma rio Soares, the outgoing Socialist president, has
made popular is proving difficult to achieve.

Despite popular respect for his integrity, support for Mr Sampaio, a
less charismatic leader, appears to be based more on disapproval of his
rival, whose government had grown increasingly unpopular before its
defeat, and on backing for Mr Guterres.

The government is avoiding decisive measures, including the
presentation of the 1996 budget, until after the presidential vote. It
hopes the political honeymoon that followed its election can be
prolonged long enough to benefit Mr Sampaio.

RUSSIA PLEDGES TOUGH LINE ON ECONOMY

   By JOHN THORNHILL in Moscow

   MOSCOW


Russia's economics ministry yesterday pledged it would continue to
pursue a harsh monetary policy designed to stabilise the economy and
cut the monthly rate of inflation to below 2 per cent despite the
strong anti-government protest vote in last month's parliamentary
elections.

However, the ministry's tough stance, contained in an annual economic
forecast, was seemingly at odds with the the softer rhetoric employed
by President Boris Yeltsin in his address to the nation on New Year's
Eve.

'The main task for 1996 is that those in Russia who today are poor
should begin to live better,' he said, promising the government would
rectify the problem of delayed wage and pension payments which has
caused great social distress.

Mr Yeltsin also lashed out at the corruption in financial circles which
was responsible for diverting money intended for social spending.

Last week, Mr Yeltsin criticised the economics ministry, employing
rhetoric reminiscent of the Stalinist era to denounce 'saboteurs' who
were responsible for undermining the reform programme.

He promised to increase payments to pensioners by compensating them for
savings eroded by the hyper-inflation of the early reform years.

Mr Yeltsin's pledges have led some economists to fear that the
government may consider loosening its monetary policy pushing up
inflation early this year. The government may come under intense
pressure to increase spending on social protection to curry electoral
favour before the presidential election in June.

But ministers have repeatedly argued that there is no contradiction
between tight monetary policies and a rise in the standard of living.

* Russia confirmed that it had missed the New Year deadline for
destroying thousands of tanks and other military hardware beyond the
Ural Mountains and said Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan had
also failed to meet the treaty commitment, Reuter reports from Moscow.

General Dmitry Kharchenko said Moscow wanted to push the December 31,
1995 deadline pledged by the Soviet Union in 1991 back to the end of
1998. The pledge had cleared the way for ratification of the
Conventional Forces in Europe treaty.

PACT TO OPEN UP STATE CONTRACTS: INTERNATIONAL NEWS DIGEST


Public procurement contracts valued at several billion dollars a year
will be thrown open to international competition under a World Trade
Organisation agreement which took effect yesterday.

The agreement covers more countries and purchasers - and applies to a
wider range of contracts - than existing rules agreed under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 15 years ago. In addition to covering
services for the first time, the new rules extend to procurement by
sub-central purchasers, such as states, provinces, departments and
utilities, as well as to central governments.

Though not all WTO members are obliged to participate in the agreement,
it has been ratified by more than 20 governments, including the US, the
European Union's 15 members, Japan, South Korea and Switzerland.
Singapore and several other countries plan to subscribe to it.

The accord excludes defence contracts, EU telecoms and the US regional
and urban public transport sector.

The complex new rules set a variety of thresholds, denominated in
Special Drawing Rights, above which contracts must be opened to
competition. The threshold for central government procurement is
SDR130,000 (Pounds 125,000), for sub-central purchasers about
SDR200,000, and for utilities roughly SDR400.000.

The agreement also lays down specified tendering procedures, to ensure
that foreign bidders and foreign goods and services are treated on the
same basis as those in the purchaser's home country. Guy de
Jonquie'res, London

Quake hits Indonesian island

A powerful earthquake measuring 7.0 on the open-ended Richter scale
shook Indonesia's Sulawesi island yesterday, destroying wooden houses
and triggering tidal waves and aftershocks.

Officials said the extent of damage along a remote isthmus, 38 miles at
its widest, in central Sulawesi was unlikely to be known until today
because of poor communications. There were no immediate reports of loss
of life.

Information was slowed by a lack of telephone lines in the remote area
between the towns of Palu, the provincial capital, and Tolitoli, to the
north-east of Palu.

Up to 1m people are believed to live in the 150-mile belt between
Tolitoli and Palu. Most of them live in narrow coastal strips separated
by mountains.

Tremors and quakes are fairly common events in Indonesia. But
casualties and damage are often minimal because of low population
densities in many areas outside towns and cities. Reuter, Jakarta

Wave of violence in Corsica

Gunmen shot dead a Corsican nationalist and three bombs exploded on the
French Mediterranean island yesterday, raising fears of a renewed
vendetta between rival separatists.

Gilbert Rossi, a 34-year-old member of the Cuncolta Naziunalista
movement, was killed by unknown attackers outside a restaurant during
New Year celebrations in the port of Ajaccio in the south-west of the
island.

Three bombs, including one at a flat owned by another Cuncolta member,
went off in the town before dawn and police defused a fourth device. No
one was hurt in the explosions. Police said no one had claimed
responsibility for the killing or the blasts.

The Cuncolta is linked to the hardline 'historic wing' of the outlawed
Corsican National Liberation Front (FLNC).

Rossi was the 13th nationalist to die since a bloody feud erupted last
year between the FLNC and the rival Movement for Self-Determination
(MPA), both demanding greater Corsican autonomy from France. Corsica
has been hit by more than a dozen bomb attacks since Christmas. Reuter,

Gene cloning raises hopes

A gene that has been linked with obesity has been cloned, a step that
brings closer a new generation of treatments for the chronically
overweight.

Two companies, Millennium of the US and Roche of Switzerland, describe
the cloning - effectively the manufacture - of the 'ob' gene in the
latest issue of the journal Cell.

The ob gene triggers the manufacture of a protein, leptin, which last
year was been shown to affect the weight of mice with no significant
side effects. But the relationship between leptin and weight in humans
has not yet been established precisely.

The two companies claim to have narrowed research to the gene's
activity in the brain, but further work is probably needed before
development of an obesity drug based on the ob gene could start.

Last year, the US biotechnology company Amgen paid Dollars 20m for to
the Rockefeller Institute in New York, which first identified the gene,
for the rights to products arising from it. Daniel Green, London

ZEROUAL PICKS LITTLE-KNOWN DIPLOMAT AS PM

   By ROULA KHALAF

Algerian President Liamine Zeroual has chosen a little-known career
diplomat as the country's new prime minister.

Mr Zeroual, elected president in November, on Sunday named Mr Ahmed
Ouyahia, his 43-year-old head of cabinet, to replace Mr Mokdad Sifi who
had been asked to stay on until the end of the year.

Most Algerians met Mr Ouyahia, who comes from the Berber province of
Tizi-Ouzou, for the first time when he appeared on state television
last July to read a statement telling them that the last round of talks
with the banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) had collapsed. The FIS
has been battling the government since 1992. Mr Ouyahia is not believed
to have taken a lead part in the negotiations.

That he is among the youngest prime ministers the country has known
points to an attempt by Mr Zeroual to reach out to a younger generation
in a country where more than 70 per cent of the people are under the
age of 30. But Mr Ouyahia's appointment sheds little light on Mr
Zeroual's post election politics.

'Zeroual has opted for a safe pair of hands, a skilled functionary
rather than a political heavyweight,' said one Algerian expert
yesterday. 'It means the composition of the government is not what
really concerns him.'

Mr Ouyahia's government is not expected to last longer than a year
because Mr Zeroual has promised legislative elections, although he has
yet to commit himself to a specific date.

The prime minister's task will centre on overseeing economic reforms
agreed with the International Monetary Fund and preparing for the
elections.

Mr Ouyahia is perhaps best known among his colleagues for arranging an
accord to end the conflict between Tuareg rebels and the Mali
government in 1992, a task which won him recognition as a skilful
negotiator.

He was named ambassador to Mali to oversee implementation of the
accord, before becoming state secretary for co-operation and Maghreb
affairs in 1993.

Although some experts have suggested the choice of a diplomat with
negotiating skills points to a determination on the part of the
president to seek national reconciliation, any negotiations with the
FIS or other opposition parties which opposed the presidential election
are likely to be conducted directly from the president's office rather
than that of the prime minister.

In a system in which the presidency enjoys wide powers, the prime
minister's office is entrusted with more of a management role.

JAPAN PUBLIC PRESSED ON LOAN BAILOUT

   By GERARD BAKER in Tokyo

   TOKYO


Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's prime minster, has urged an increasingly
sceptical Japanese public to accept the government's plan to spend more
than Y685bn (Pounds 4.37bn) in bailing out the country's failed housing
loan companies.

In a New Year message to the nation, Mr Murayama signalled the start of
what is likely to be a fierce political struggle over the bailout in
the new parliamentary session which begins later this month.

The prime minister acknowledged the unpopularity of the plan, which
will cost every individual in the country at least Y5,500, but said it
had been an unavoidable and 'painful' decision.

He promised a full investigation into the causes of the failure of the
seven companies. 'I will try from now on to shed light on the entire
problem,' he added.

Last month the cabinet agreed to allocate Y685bn from next year's
budget to pay for the cost of partially reimbursing creditors of the
bankrupt housing lenders. The government also committed itself to
spending more if the final costs of liquidation turn out to be greater
than is forecast.

The companies, which were established by the leading banks in the
1970s, are on the verge of collapse under a pile of nonperforming loans
which were advanced mostly in a bout of reckless lending to the
property sector during the bubble economy of the late 1980s.

Popular opposition to the principle of spending taxpayers' money has
escalated since the decision was announced and will be exploited by
opposition parties when the parliamentary discussion of the national
budget begins at the end of January.

Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the newly elected leader of the main opposition New
Frontier party, signalled his determination at the weekend to oppose
the bailout if the government did not provide a satisfactory and
detailed account of who was responsible for the costly mess.

The government has already attempted to propitiate the public's anger
by hastily removing the senior bureaucrat at the ministry of finance,
Mr Kyosuke Shinozawa. Mr Shinozawa, the administrative vice minister
for finance, resigned last week, in part to take responsibility for the
housing loan problem.

But the opposition wants the blame for the fiasco to be spread much
more liberally among both politicians and bureaucrats.

In its sights are Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the finance minister, and most
intriguingly, Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, the international trade minister
and leader of the Liberal Democratic party, the largest coalition
partner. Mr Hashimoto was finance minister during the period when most
of the reckless lending of the housing loan companies was undertaken.

In 1990 the finance ministry issued guidelines to all financial
institutions to curtail their lending to property-related companies.
But the instructions did not apply to the housing lenders which
continued to pour money into highly speculative real estate projects.

The finance ministry has promised a full inquiry into the circumstances
of the housing lenders' demise, and has promised that those found
responsible, bankers, politicians and bureaucrats, will be held to
account.

But even a spate of resignations may not prove enough in the current
political heat. Many members of the socialist party, the second largest
coalition member, are profoundly unhappy about the bailout, as are some
officials in the finance ministry.

If the political pressure intensifies, some members of the coalition
may break ranks and oppose the deal.

Defeat for the government on such a crucial part of its budget plans
for 1996 would have potentially disastrous consequences for its
viability.

CONSERVATIVE ABDULLAH TAKES REINS OF POWER

   By ROULA KHALAF

Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah, yesterday entrusted with the
running of the government by his half-brother King Fahd, has been
described as more conservative than the king, less likely to
accommodate the west and possibly prone to pumping less oil to raise
prices.

However, as experts and diplomats were quick to point out, Saudi Arabia
run by the crown prince is likely to follow the same economic and
foreign affairs policies the west has become accustomed to under King
Fahd.

If the king's health improves, the handing over of the running of the
government may be no more than a temporary measure and, until Crown
Prince Abdullah takes over for good, King Fahd will continue to have
the final word on big decisions.

One of more than 30 surviving sons of the late King Abdul Aziz, the
71-year-old crown prince is known as a traditional bedouin who enjoys
important ties to the tribes of Saudi Arabia. The fact that he had a
different mother from the king's other powerful brothers has meant that
he comes from a less prominent branch than the other sons of King Abdul
Aziz.

But as the closest in age to King Fahd, he was named crown prince when
the latter took over in 1982. Although this has been a source of
rivalry with the rest of the clan, the sons of Abdul Aziz are known to
stick together when times get rough.

The crown prince is well respected and known for a stutter which seems
to disappear when giving public speeches. The bedouin base is his main
source of strength. Since 1963, he has commanded the National Guard, a
largely bedouin force which looks after internal security and acts as a
counterweight to the army.

Citing his strong links to Syria and the Palestinians, as well as a
reported reluctance to allow American troops to set up their base in
Saudi Arabia during the 1990 Gulf war, the crown prince is believed to
be less internationally minded than his half-brother. He is not known
to speak English, for example, and has played a role in cultivating
links with the Arab world.

This, however, say diplomats, is unlikely to have a bearing on the
Kingdom's close ties to the west, especially the US. 'The US alliance
is a vital strategic alliance which the Saudis will not do much to
change,' a diplomat said yesterday.

Moreover, according to Saudi observers, the crown prince played a
prominent part in drumming up public support within the Kingdom for the
Gulf war.

'He is more decisive than the king but less reflective perhaps,' said
one veteran Saudi observer who knows the crown prince.

'The king is very cautious and tends to see procrastination as a
virtue. Abdullah is less hesitant in his style and quicker to judge.'

Such a style, said the observer, may translate into more forceful
dealings with Islamic fundamentalists who have bombarded the kingdom
with faxes from a propaganda base in London.

Islamic dissidents are also suspected of having perpetrated the
November 13 bomb attack on a US-staffed Saudi National Guard
communications centre in Riyadh.

As the 1996 budget unveiled yesterday suggests, economic reforms
started in 1994 will continue. Faced with the collapse of oil prices,
Saudi Arabia has had to clamp down on spending in recent years, give a
larger role to the private sector and boost non-oil revenues.

In an address to the nation, Crown Prince Abdullah said: 'No doubt you
know the financial situation that emerged from the (1991) Gulf war and
that your government had (earlier) promised to continue its treatment
so matters could return to what they used to be - strength and
balance.'

The kingdom in recent years has been committed to keeping crude output
at 8m barrels a day in order to avoid a repeat of the mid 1980s, when
it was faced with falling prices and falling production. Diplomats said
yesterday that the crown prince was in the 1970s believed to favour a
policy of increased production but that they were confident the story
would not hold today.

As reforms are pursued, however, diplomats said yesterday that for as
long as the crown prince is only acting on behalf of the king, he will
have to find a way to accommodate the king's other prominent brothers
to minimise friction.

This may mean that in governing he will resort to consultation and seek
the co-operation of from powerful members such as Prince Sultan, the
defence minister, who is next in line for succession.

INDONESIA'S CONGLOMERATES LOOK TO MARKET FORCES

   By GREG EARL in Jakarta

   JAKARTA


Indonesia's big conglomerates, long regarded as 'crony capitalists'
receiving government favours, are becoming much more dependent on
market forces for their growth, according to a study.

The study of sales and asset growth of the country's top groups,
conducted by the Indonesian Business Data Centre, a private agency,
also shows that 300 businesses are responsible for about half the
country's gross domestic product.

The centre's director, Mr Christianto Wibisono, said the study showed a
distinct move away from reliance on government-awarded licences for
business growth in Indonesia. He said only 27 of the groups were now
dependent on managed trading and monopoly arrangements although many of
the larger groups had been established under those business conditions.

The 300 groups are estimated to have increased sales by 15 per cent in
1994 to Dollars 74bn (Pounds 48bn).

The figures point to some increased concentration in the hands of the
largest groups with the 10 largest recording a 17 per cent increase in
sales to Dollars 26bn. There were 31 groups with total sales of Dollars
350m, accounting for 55 per cent of total sales, whereas in 1993 there
were estimated to have been 24 groups with that level of sales
accounting for 49 per cent of total revenue.

Concentration is more evident on an assets basis with 56 groups
controlling three quarters of the Dollars 118bn in total assets of the
300 businesses.

The dominance of the economy by people of Chinese descent is underlined
by the fact that only 79 of the 300 groups are owned by ethnic
Indonesians and 203 by non-ethnic Indonesians, predominantly Chinese.

While there are few surprises among the company's largest companies,
several new players are fast emerging, with 11 groups estimated to have
grown by 50 per cent in 1994.

TALKS TO RESUME ON US BUDGET IMPASSE

   By PATTI WALDMEIR in Washington

   WASHINGTON


US President Bill Clinton will meet congressional Republican leaders
later today to resume talks on ending the protracted federal budget
dispute, after extended negotiations over the New Year weekend failed
to yield agreement either on balancing the budget, or on the more
immediate problem of ending the partial government shutdown.

Mr Clinton and Republicans met throughout Saturday and Sunday, before
recessing for New Year's Day. Both sides said no significant decisions
were taken during those negotiations, which focused on outlining areas
of disagreement.

But Mr Bob Dole, Senate majority leader, said negotiators were now
ready to 'start making the tough decisions'. And there were signs of
some flexibility from radical freshmen Republicans in Congress: several
of them, interviewed on weekend television programmes, made clear that
they were willing to compromise on the Dollars 245bn (Pounds 159bn) tax
cut included in their plan, saying balancing the budget was more
important than cutting taxes. Mr Clinton favours a much more modest tax
cut.

Mr Mike McCurry, the White House spokesman, said today's negotiations
would focus on 'trade-offs' between cuts in healthcare spending, taxes
and welfare needed to balance the budget over seven years, as agreed by
both sides in November. There was no sign at the weekend that the two
sides had resolved the basic philosophical dispute which underlies the
budget impasse: whether to shift power away from the federal government
to the states, as the Republicans want; and whether to curb guarantees
of healthcare for the poor and elderly.

Both issues are likely to influence the outcome of this year's
presidential election campaign, which will soon shift into top gear
with a concentration of state presidential primary elections in
February and March.

Parallel efforts will resume today to solve the more immediate problem
of getting federal employees back to work, and ending the shutdown,
which has already lasted more than a fortnight.

The President and First Lady spent New Year's Eve and Day away from the
frustrations of the budget impasse, celebrating with 1,000 friends at
the Hilton Head resort in South Carolina, where they attended a
traditional New Year seminar to debate subjects such as 'morals,
manners, and today's pop culture' and 'politics, media and the decline
of civility'.

RHODES' HEIRS RETURN TO ZAMBIA'S COPPER MINES: AFTER 25 YEARS OF
NATIONALISATION, BOARDROOMS IN JOHANNESBURG AND LONDON COULD AGAIN
DETERMINE THE DEVELOPMENT OF ITS LEADING INDUSTRY, REPORTS TONY HAWKINS


Cecil John Rhodes would have relished the irony. Twenty five years
after Kenneth Kaunda, Zambia's founding president, nationalised the
country's copper mines, the government of President Frederick Chiluba
may be on the verge of taking the first step towards meeting its
promise to put the industry back into the private sector.

Negotiations with Anglo American Corporation for a feasibility study
for the development of the Konkola copper mining project are close to
conclusion, say industry officials.

It would be a move as rich in symbolism as the 1969 take-over itself,
seen at the time as heralding a new era for a country that was once
little more than a fiefdom of Rhodes' British South Africa Company.

Rhodes' vision of the company blazing a commercial trail from the Cape
to Cairo, in the name of an empire run by Englishmen, 'is now buried -
I hope and pray, never to rise again in this part of Africa,' declared
Mr Kaunda, architect of what turned out a disastrous socialist
programme.

Once again, however, boardrooms in Johannesburg and London could
determine the development of an industry still at the heart of Zambia's
economy, accounting for more than 90 per cent of export earnings.

With reserves at the Nchanga copper mine, which supplies ore to the
state-owned Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), likely to be
exhausted by the end of the decade, the government is under mounting
pressure to give the go-ahead for the Dollars 600m (Pounds 390m)
Konkola project.

Although widely anticipated, the decision to invite the South African
mining house, which has a 27.3 per cent stake in ZCCM, to prepare a
study and lead a consortium to develop the new mine will be
controversial, not just because Anglo American is being invited back.
The Konkola decision will also have far-reaching implications for the
privatisation of ZCCM itself.

While Zambia's privatisation programme has accelerated in the past year
- by the end of September, 87 out of 217 business units had been
processed, resulting in a significant inflow of new investment and
expertise - progress in dealing with the politically sensitive copper
mining industry has been slow.

Whereas privatisation of dozens of small state-owned businesses has
passed off with little controversy, the sale of the crown jewels, in
the form of ZCCM, is a different matter, not least because Mr Kaunda is
back on the campaign trail, preparing to contest next October's
presidential elections.

United Nations Conference on Trade and Development figures, published
last month in the World Investment Report, estimate an inflow of more
than Dollars 350m in new foreign investment since the 1991 elections.
In the last year a number of multinationals have returned to, or
expanded operations in, Zambia by buying state-owned companies.

The list includes Tate & Lyle in sugar, Unilever and HJ Heinz in food
processing and toiletries, the Commonwealth Development Corporation in
cement and agriculture, South African Breweries in brewing and Anglo
American in hotels.

The net result is that Zambia attracted more foreign investment in
1991/94 than any other sub-Saharan country, except oil exporters
Nigeria and Angola.

Nevertheless, the announcement of ZCCM's privatisation just months
before elections may seriously damage the prospects of Mr Chiluba's
Movement for Multiparty Democracy.

The past four years of structural adjustment have been extremely
painful, with falling per capita incomes, rising unemployment, high
inflation and interest rates and plummeting industrial production.

That all of this was necessary to turn around an economy brought to its
knees by 27 years of mismanagement by Mr Kaunda's United National
Independence party (UNIP) may count for little when voters come to cast
their ballots.

Economic reform would have paid dividends far more rapidly had the
privatisation programme, now beginning to show real results, been
implemented both sooner and more efficiently; had the country not had
two droughts; and, most important, had the copper mines been able to
exploit a period of strong demand and high prices.

Figures for the first nine months of 1995 point to copper output of
about 325,000 tonnes this year, down 8 per cent on 1994 and less than
half the average of over 700,000 tonnes a year in the late 1960s.

In cost of production terms, ZCCM is in the top 10 per cent of global
producers. Competitiveness will deteriorate further when costs grow as
Nchanga nears the end of its economic life, and the industry suffers
from the cumulative effects of undercapitalisation, inadequate skills,
reinvestment and maintenance spending, and weak management.

If all goes to plan, Konkola will be developed as a joint venture
between the government, whose contribution is likely to take the form
of providing already existing smelting and refining capacity - thereby
further weakening the rump of ZCCM itself - and a Anglo-led consortium,
which may take some 60 per cent of the equity in the scheme.

While such an arrangement makes sound commercial sense, it will leave
Mr Chiluba open to the criticism of privatising ZCCM by stealth.

An agreement in principle to develop Konkola, however, will reassure an
increasingly restive donor community.

The response from the finance minister, Mr Ronald Penza, struck an
equivocal note, speaking of the need for 'the utmost caution' in
privatising the mines.

'We must have the necessary political support,' he said - which was
interpreted by some donors as political shorthand for more delay.

SRI LANKA'S WAR EUPHORIA FADES

   By AMAL JAYASINGHE in Colombo

   COLOMBO


The euphoria that erupted when Sri Lanka's military scored a
significant victory last month over separatist Tamil rebels in their
northern stronghold of Jaffna has sharply diminished with steep price
increases coming into effect in the New Year to pay mounting war bills.

President Chandrika Kumaratunga yesterday promised to press ahead with
a carrot-and-stick strategy to end more than two decades of ethnic
violence which has claimed more than 50,000 lives.

'The economic cost of the war will have an all-round effect in terms of
higher prices,' Mr GL Peiris, deputy finance minister, said. 'This is a
war for peace, so there is no question that we have to find the
resources for it.'

The government estimates that the war against the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) will cost Dollars 760m (Pounds 495m) this year, up
from a provisional Dollars 640m in 1995.

The seemingly unending fighting was felt by the tiny Colombo Stock
Exchange, which shed 33 per cent of its value during 1995. Amid falling
foreign reserves, the Sri Lankan rupee depreciated by 8 per cent
against the dollar in 1995.

Yesterday the government lifted a ban on local banks raising capital
abroad, in an attempt to reduce domestic interest rates, which last
month galloped to 105 per cent amid a cash flow crisis.

It is also raising telecommunications charges by 20 per cent, bus fares
by 50 per cent and electricity tariffs by 20 to 100 per cent, depending
on the rate of consumption.

However, Mr AS Jayewardena, the central bank governor, said the
economic picture should improve in 1996, with foreign capital inflows
expected to rise with the sale of state enterprises.

The government is hoping to attract Dollars 420m in foreign capital
from privatisation, including the sale of the telecommunications
operator and the national airline, AirLanka. The projections are
considered too optimistic by private analysts.

Government politicians said the rising prices and the government's
failure to turn the military success into a political victory had
turned initial enthusiasm into despondency.

Despite the fall of Jaffna, the Tigers have shown that they are still
able to carry out spectacular guerrilla attacks using suicide bombers.
Army camps and convoys have been targeted by lone Tiger guerrillas
laden with explosives.

Tamil men, women and children who fled the fighting in Jaffna are
sheltered in areas of the country's north still under rebel dominance.
The Tigers say they will not allow civilians to cross over to
government-held areas of Jaffna.

Defence analysts say that eventually the guerrillas will have to allow
civilians to return home because that would help the Tigers to go back
to Jaffna and revert to hit-and-run attacks against the army.

The military on the other hand is ill-equipped to supply its
35,000strong force in Jaffna because all land routes to the region are
dominated by the rebels. They depend on the minuscule air force and the
navy.

Mr Anuruddha Ratwatte, deputy defence minister, said the army would
soon open a land route to Jaffna. It would mean a fresh offensive that
would cost many more lives, officials said, and the army was already
bracing for it.

ZEDILLO RESHUFFLES CABINET

   By DANIEL DOMBEY in Mexico City

   MEXICO CITY


A year to the day after he lost his finance minister in the fall-out
from Mexico's botched devaluation, President Ernesto Zedillo last week
made further changes to a government still struggling with the
unpopularity unleashed by the currency crisis.

Mr Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza, who as energy minister was criticised for
links to the old guard of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party,
has been replaced, along with Ms Norma Samaniego, the country's
comptroller general, who was thought to be keeping too low a profile to
get to grips with Mexico's allegedly rampant corruption. Mr Carlos
Salomon, the head of Mr Zedillo's press office and frequent target of
complaints about the administration's news management at times when
speculation about government changes unsettled the peso, has also been
removed.

The alterations leave key economic posts unchanged and do not indicate
any big shift in strategy. While the new energy secretary, Mr Jesus
Reyes Heroles, spent much of the previous administration of President
Carlos Salinas advocating a more interventionist economic approach, the
new comptroller general, Mr Arsenio Farell, helped push through the
wage-labour pacts that then provided the centrepiece of economic
policy.

Mr Zedillo's supporters claim the alterations draw a line under the
political difficulties of the government's first year and set the stage
for further reform. But other observers deem the changes a tardy
reaction to months of persistent criticism of Mr Zedillo's team.

'This is a defensive move. It does not take the initiative as a more
thorough going reshuffle would have done,' said Mr Juan Molinar, a
politics professor at El Colegio de Mexico, a graduate research
institution.

Mr Zedillo does not face a nationwide electoral test until
congressional elections due in 1997. But he can ill afford a repetition
this year of 1995's election results, which saw the main right-wing
opposition party establish control over roughly a third of local
government, and win three of five governorship elections.

With the government predicting an economic recovery of only 3 per cent
growth this year after a fall of 7 per cent in 1995, Mr Zedillo's new
appointees will find themselves the focus of added attention in their
tasks of managing the government's relationship with the press,
reducing bureaucratic profligacy and reforming and attracting new
investment to the country's energy sector.

POOREST DEPEND ON BENEFITS 'FOR 70% OF INCOME'

   By GRAHAM BOWLEY

The poorest 20 per cent of households get almost three-quarters of
their income from state benefits, government statisticians have found.

Cash benefits made up 70 per cent of the gross income of the bottom
fifth of Britain's households in the last financial year (1994-95),
according to the Central Statistical Office's latest survey of economic
trends.

Taxes and government benefits trebled the share of total income of the
poorest 20 per cent of households, the study shows.

Their share of total UK income grew from 2.3 per cent before taxes and
benefits to 6.9 per cent after taxes and benefits.

Before tax, the top fifth of households earned 20 times more than the
lowest fifth but only four times as much after taxes and benefits.

The top 20 per cent of households paid 19.6 per cent of their gross
income in income tax compared with 11 per cent paid by other
households.

State pensions accounted for almost three-quarters of the cash benefits
received by retired households, the study finds.

The distribution of income before tax is more equal among those still
at work than those who have retired.

But the distribution of after-tax income is more equal among retired
than among working households.

The CSO gives, for the first time, a regional breakdown of gross
domestic product and investment. This shows that in 1994 - the latest
year for which complete figures are available - the south-east, home to
31 per cent of the population, accounted for about 36 per cent of GDP.

The north-west, which was the second most productive region, produced
9.9 per cent of the UK's total GDP.

Northern Ireland accounted for the lowest proportion of GDP at 2.3 per
cent.

The south-east also had the highest GDP per capita at Pounds 11,407 per
head - compared with the UK average of Pounds 9,768.

The lowest was Northern Ireland where people earned Pounds 8,027 per
head and Wales where the figure was Pounds 8,274.

But this gap is narrowing. Growth in GDP per head has been higher in
Northern Ireland than any other region since 1990.

Income from employment was the source of more than 65 per cent of GDP
in Scotland, whereas it accounted for less than 61 per cent in East
Anglia and the south-west.

GLOOMIER PROSPECTS PREDICTED FOR THE ECONOMY

   By GRAHAM BOWLEY, Economics staff

A gloomier outlook for the UK economy emerged today with a leading
forecaster predicting that growth will slow in 1996 and a poll which
shows that business confidence is at its lowest since 1992.

The latest report by Cambridge Econometrics, the economic consultancy,
says a slowdown in the rest of the world will depress Britain's exports
this year.

It says companies will also cut output as they try to sell the stocks
they built up in 1995.

As a result, UK gross domestic product will grow by less than 2.5 per
cent in 1996 compared with 2.75 per cent in 1995. This prediction
clashes with the official Treasury forecast of 3 per cent growth this
year.

But growth will rebound in 1997 to 2.8 per cent, the forecasting group
says. It thinks spending by consumers will grow modestly in 1996 and
then expand strongly next year - due partly to tax cuts in the next
Budget.

Meanwhile, a survey of 2,000 businesses published today by Lloyds Bank
shows that confidence is at its lowest level since the poll began in
1992. For the first time the survey shows an increase in those
businesses reporting cashflow prob-lems and a slowdown in export
orders.

Orders for goods and services continue to grow - but at the slowest
rate since the second half of 1992. The poll shows that confidence has
dropped as economic growth has been disappointingly slow.

Mr Michael Riding, the director of commercial banking at Lloyds Bank,
said that although companies 'are still experiencing growth, they are
having difficulty in coming to terms with managing in a low inflation
economy. This, coupled with failed growth expectations, has made them
somewhat pessimistic - possibly unnecessarily'.

Companies in the construction and retail sectors reported the slowest
growth in orders, while manufacturing companies and hotels and catering
businesses reported strong growth.

Companies told Lloyds Bank that investment spending has slowed because
of slower profit growth and increased pressure on cashflow. However,
Cambridge Econometrics predicts that investment will pick up in 1996 as
the private finance initiative fills much of the gap left by cuts in
government capital spending.

The forecasting group says there is evidence of a build-up in stocks in
the motor vehicle, chemical and non-metallic mineral product
industries.

It predicts that headline inflation will fall in the short-term in
response to lower mortgage interest rates although the underlying rate
will remain broadly unchanged.

In the longer term, headline inflation will rise to 3.7 per cent in
1997 from 3.1 per cent currently.

WALDEGRAVE RESOLVES TO START EARLY: NEW YEAR AIMS INCLUDE PUSHING THE
PFI AND TACKLING FRAUD

   By ROBERT CHOTE

Like the arrival of Christmas in the shops, negotiations between the
Treasury and government departments over public spending seem to get
earlier every year.

The detail of the last public spending round was published only a month
ago, at the time of the Budget. But Mr William Waldegrave, the chief
secretary to the Treasury, is already preparing for the opening
skirmishes of this year's battle.

Mr Waldegrave said in an interview with the Financial Times that he
planned to emulate his predecessor, Mr Jonathan Aitken, by looking at
the spending of larger departments in spring, before the haggling
proper gets under way.

The Department of Social Security will come under particular scrutiny,
according to Mr Waldegrave. Its Pounds 90bn budget next year will be
Whitehall's largest by far, so it is bound to be an important target in
any search for savings.

'It is essential that they are feeling the full force of the
possibilities of new ways of doing things,' Mr Waldegrave said. 'Peter
Lilley has exciting things to say about how benefits can be delivered
in a few years' time. What the Treasury has to see is whether 'a few
years' time' can be made any shorter.'

Mr Waldegrave has been criticised by some MPs for allowing too big an
increase in the DSS's running costs during the last spending round. But
he argues that some cuts have actually cost money by weakening control
of the benefit system.

Mr Waldegrave said it was clear that the proportion of social security
claimed fraudulently - estimated at between 5 per cent and 10 per cent
for some benefits - was much larger than most observers had thought.

He noted that a pilot scheme to issue some claimants in London with
swipecards was already saving money. 'One of the things I have to do
early in the new year is see what is a practicable, do-able,
non-fantastic programme here which might generate another few hundred
million,' he said.

Mr Waldegrave said there was also scope to push the private finance
initiative, which attracts private sector funds and expertise into
public sector infrastructure projects.

'One thing we have broken the back of this year is institutional
resistance to the PFI, although it only generates a saving for public
expenditure in terms of delivering better value for money,' he said.

Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, believes that
economic activity may be slowed in the short term by an 'infrastructure
hiatus' as private finance replaces direct public funding. But Mr
Waldegrave said he expected private money to be attracted more quickly
than the Treasury assumed in the Budget.

There were no 'wonder drugs' which would deliver savings from
government spending next year, Mr Waldegrave added. He ruled out the
idea of taking a tougher line with the Department of National Heritage
because of the extra revenue from the National Lottery.

But Mr Waldegrave admitted he was attracted - although this was a
personal rather than a Treasury view - to the idea that arts
organisations could be funded through endowments. This would limit the
centralisation of public support for the arts, although it would not
necessarily save money.

Mr Waldegrave said that in framing a long-term strategy for public
spending, it was unrealistic to aim for the low government shares of
national income achieved in some Asia-Pacific countries.

Nations such as the US, New Zealand and Switzerland were better role
models, implying a government share of national income of 35 per cent
or 36 per cent. Public spending stands at 42 per cent of national
income, compared with the formal target of less than 40 per cent.

Mr Waldegrave said every chief secretary had the ambition of reaching a
stage where it was no longer necessary to hold public spending
negotiations every year. He said it was worth investigating the idea
that departments could agree a tough settlement on the understanding
that their budgets were guaranteed for a number of years. But he
conceded that departments would fear that a future chief secretary
would not feel bound by the pledge.

So the annual ritual of the public spending negotiations remains with
us. Every year departments will squeal about the pressure they are
under, and the chief secretary will proclaim one of the toughest rounds
in living memory.

TORIES WARN OVER NICHOLSON ATTACKS

   By JAMES BLITZ, Lobby Correspondent

Senior left-of-centre Conservatives yesterday warned the government to
tone down its attacks on Miss Emma Nicholson, the MP for Devon West and
Torridge, following her defection to the Liberal Democrats last week.

As her decision to quit the Conservatives continued to inflame the
long-running battle between leftwing and rightwing Tories, Mr Peter
Temple-Morris, the MP for Leominster, condemned the 'torrent of
personal abuse' being heaped on Miss Nicholson - arguing that the
criticisms were not helping to settle pro-European Tory MPs in the wake
of her defection.

In recent days Mr Michael Heseltine, the deputy prime minister, has
claimed that Miss Nicholson's departure followed her repeated and
unsuccessful attempts to gain a ministerial post within the government.

Mr Michael Portillo, the defence secretary, compounded the criticism
yesterday by arguing that Miss Nicholson had 'demonstrated a history of
disloyalty' - in part by deciding to vote against Baroness Thatcher in
the 1990 Conservative leadership contest.

However, Mr Temple-Morris, a Euro-enthusiast who, ironically, is often
associated with Mr Heseltine's cause, warned that the attacks on Miss
Nicholson were further damaging party morale.

'If someone does defect from the party, then that is bad enough without
personalising things,' he said. 'But ministers are creating a situation
in which the public probably has some sympathy with her.'

Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, attacked the language with
which Mr Portillo had castigated Miss Nicholson, insisting that
ministers needed to understand why she had made such a move.

'This is what I regret, that members of the cabinet should be indulging
in this sort of language and this approach,' he told BBC Radio 4's
Today programme. 'We should be making sure that other people who have
anxieties should have those anxieties removed so the public should see
we are not a bitterly divided party, that we have pulled ourselves
together and can work together.'

Ministers were yesterday hoping that the circumstances of Miss
Nicholson's move were exceptional and would not be followed by further
defections.

But party whips will be heeding the recent claim by Mr Hugh Dykes, the
MP for Harrow East, that a further six Tories could defect to
opposition parties before the next general election. Mr Dykes, one of
the most staunchly pro-European of Conservatives, will have his every
move watched closely by Tory whips in the next few months.

Others whose names have been speculated upon as possible defectors are
Mr Temple-Morris; Mr Robert Hicks, MP for Cornwall South East; Sir
Keith Speed, MP for Ashford; Mr George Walden, MP for Buckingham; and
Mr Tim Rathbone, MP for Lewes.

None of these has been prepared to admit that he is seeking to move to
another party. However, two of them - Mr Hicks and Mr Walden - have
indicated dissatisfaction with the direction of politics at Westminster
by announcing that they will not be standing at the next general
election. Sir Keith Speed is also standing down at the next election.

SALES SUCCESS LESS SWEET AS CHEWERS AVOID SUGAR

   By JOHN AUTHERS

Consumers tried to cut down on their sugar in 1995, according to the
annual survey for the chocolate and sweets markets carried out by
Cadbury-Schweppes, the confectionery company.

While Nestle's Kit Kat bar consolidated its lead over the Mars Bar -
perceived as more fattening - in the chocolate market, the most popular
sweet was Wrigley's Extra, a sugar-free chewing gum.

Total consumption of chocolate declined slightly compared with 1994,
from 530,000 tonnes to 526,000 tonnes, a trend which manufacturers
attributed to the hot weather during the summer. But total spending on
chocolate reached a new high of Pounds 3.2bn.

Kit Kat's sales rose 4 per cent to Pounds 200m while those of Mars,
fell 2 per cent to Pounds 150m.

A report in June by Datamonitor, the market research company, said Kit
Kat's share of the chocolate snack market had stayed at about 17.4 per
cent between 1990 and 1994, while the Mars Bar's share had dropped from
16 per cent to 11.7 per cent.

Mars made changes to its product last year in an attempt to appeal to
women and to make its bars seem less fattening, introducing bite-sized
versions and changing the recipe to make it taste lighter. Cadbury's
Dairy Milk consolidated its place as the third most popular chocolate.

In the market for sweets, Wrigley's Extra gum finished ahead of Polo
mints and Rowntree's Fruit Pastilles, according to the annual review by
Trebor Bassett, the sugar confectionery division of Cadbury's. Orbit by
Wrigley, another sugar-free gum, came fourth, well ahead of the better
known Wrigley's Spearmint, which was 17th.

The total size of the market was less than half that for chocolate,
with total sales of Pounds 1.4bn and 283,000 tonnes sold. Average
spending per capita for the year was Pounds 24.

The hot summer weather also affected sales of sweets, which include
cough lozenges in the top 20, according to Trebor Bassett. But it
added: 'There remains enormous future potential for market growth - we
still have quite a way to go before we match the per capita consumption
for sweets of our European neighbours.'

FIAT STEPS UP DRIVE FOR IMPORT POSITION

   By JOHN GRIFFITHS

Fiat Auto UK is restructuring its dealer networks as part of a campaign
to regain its status as one of the UK new car market's biggest
importers.

The company is reorganising its 220-strong Fiat dealer network and
increasing its Alfa-Romeo dealerships by 25 per cent.

The moves strengthening the dealer networks come as the Italian group's
wholly-owned UK subsidiary prepares today to launch its Bravo and Brava
models. They are intended to challenge Ford's Escort, Vauxhall's Astra
and other similar-sized models in one of the biggest sectors of the UK
new car market. Fiat spent more than Pounds 1bn developing the new
models.

The new models appear set to return the Fiat brand to the 4 per
cent-plus market share levels not seen since the early 1980s. Mr James
Blades, Fiat Auto UK's managing director, now expects final figures to
show Fiat's market share in 1995 reached 3.6 per cent, with total sales
approaching 75,000 when about 3,000 Alfa-Romeo sales are included.

Fiat's UK market share peaked in 1979 at 4.9 per cent, with sales of
Lancia models at the time lifting the group's share above 5 per cent.
Yet for much of the 1980s Fiat's share slid downwards, mainly because
of the parent group's failure to invest in new models. By 1992 it had
slumped to less than 2 per cent.

So poor were Lancia sales that Fiat has stopped importing them to the
UK altogether, while sales of Alfa-Romeo - bought by Fiat in 1987 -
currently represent less than 0.2 per cent of the UK market.

However, the launch of two small cars, the Punto and Cinquecento, has
already brought about a strong revival. Mr Blades said: 'We are now
working hard to ensure that further growth is stable and sustainable.
That means making further inroads to fleets so as not to be subject to
the whims of private buyers.'

Fiat's concern in this respect is illustrated by Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders statistics showing that the total new car
market in the UK grew 2 per cent in the first 11 months of 1995. Yet
within this total fleet demand grew 7 per cent whereas sales to private
buyers have stagnated.

The importance of the fleet sector to manufacturers and importers is
underlined by the fact that around 47 per cent of new cars in 1996 are
expected to be bought by fleets.

Fiat's sales to fleets in 1995 played a big part in its outperformance
of the new car market overall. At 67,400 Fiat's total sales in the
first 11 months were 20 per cent higher than in the same period in
1994, compared with only a 2 per cent rise in the UK new car market
overall. Within the total, however, sales to fleets have jumped 43 per
cent. The importance of Bravo/Brava to Fiat's further UK growth is
underlined by the fact that the model segment in which they will
compete accounts for more than 30 per cent of the fleet market.

Under the dealer restructuring, Fiat is retaining the overall size of
the network at about 220 dealers but replacing many of the smaller,
less committed outlets with facilities owned by the bigger retailing
groups. As a result of the shake-up, now in its final stages, some 30
per cent of the network is owned by members of the UK's top 100
retailing groups which are capable of making the substantial investment
that Fiat wants to see.

CRITICS TURN ON TERRORISM INSURANCE FOR CITY: AS THE IRA CEASEFIRE HAS
LITTLE EFFECT ON PREMIUMS, BUSINESSES QUESTION THE EXISTENCE OF
REINSURER POOL RE

   By RALPH ATKINS

When the IRA bombed the City of London in 1992 and 1993 causing more
than Pounds 1bn in damage, businesses were thankful anyone was prepared
to provide insurance against further attacks.

With insurers set to exclude unlimited terrorism cover from commercial
policies, the setting up of Pool Re - a state-backed 'reinsurance'
company which would underwrite policies sold by conventional insurers -
was seen as a sensible response.

Nearly three years later, as many companies renegotiate policies due
for renewal, the mood has changed.

Pool Re is criticised as expensive and inflexible. The Association of
Insurance and Risk Managers, which represents commercial insurance
buyers, reckons the high rates Pool Re charges are forcing companies to
choose between spending large amounts on terrorism cover - or risk
going without.

The IRA ceasefire has had a limited impact. Premium rates have fallen:
a 20 per cent discount has been announced for next year. Pool Re also
collects only 60 per cent of the policy premium at the start of the
year; the remaining 40 per cent is waived if total claims during the
year do not exceed a certain level (Pounds 75m in 1996).

But terrorism cover used to be included in standard commercial property
policies at no additional cost. As Mr Leslie Lucas, Pool Re chief
executive, admits: 'Any policyholder is going to say that, if we once
had it offered for nothing, any price is going to be too much.'

There is also concern that the structure of Pool Re is preventing the
development of an alternative terrorism insurance market.

Because Pool Re started in 1993 without any capital, it had to operate
as a mutual, pooling the resources of those who depended on its
services. It insists member insurance companies only sell terrorism
cover at rates and on terms set by Pool Re. Premiums are pooled into an
insurance fund which at the end of 1994 stood at Pounds 410m but is
likely now to be substantially higher. Because most insurers are Pool
Re members, companies have little option but to buy Pool Re policies.

Moreover, corporate groups cannot 'cherry pick' - buying insurance
policies backed by Pool Re only for vulnerable properties. Apart from
smaller sites, they have to buy cover for all or none.

Rates are set according to formula varying by location. There is only
limited scope for taking account of measures individual companies might
take to reduce their exposure to terrorist attack.

Mr Alan Gavaghan, deputy chairman of insurance broker Willis Corroon,
says: 'A lot of companies spend a lot of money on risk prevention
action, not just things like sprinklers and shatter-proof windows. They
have put a lot of thought into it, but they are treated in the same way
as people with clapped out warehouses.'

Alternatives are available. Willis Corroon is one of five brokers which
combined to provide terrorism insurance underwritten by syndicates at
Lloyd's of London which are not Pool Re members.

Last month the facility was improved and policies paying out up to
Pounds 100m per terrorist attack are available. That means large
companies could choose to insure just their most vulnerable properties.

But the total amount of insurance coverage available is limited. Prices
may also not be sufficiently attractive for companies to switch from
Pool Re policies which provide unlimited cover. As Mr Jeremy Lowe, of
Willis Corroon, says: 'It is a viable alternative to Pool Re for those
who want to be selective, rather than a competitor.'

In spite of its criticism, the Association of Insurance and Risk
Managers do not want to kill the idea of a pool.

'The concept is a good one,' says Ms Ina Barker, executive director.
'The premiums of the many pay for the claims of the few.' There is also
little sign that insurers and reinsurers are willing to return to
providing full terrorism cover without state back-up.

The association's idea is that Pool Re should be funded by a flat
contribution, or levy, on all commercial property policies. That should
allow a return to the automatic provision of terrorism cover. As funds
are built up by Pool Re - assuming there is no escalation of terrorism
- there would be scope for contributions holidays.

Potentially, Pool Re could evolve into a state-backed reinsurer
providing cover against other perils where the incidence is low but
potential costs could be catastrophic - London flooding is a possible
example.

The aim would be to achieve the basic principle of insurance -
spreading big risks on the shoulders of many. Ms Barker says:
'Terrorism insurance ought to be automatic for the benefit of society.'

FISHING PATROL MOVES INTO DISPUTED AREA

   By BERNARD GRAY

HMS Lindisfarne, a UK Fisheries Protection Vessel, yesterday went on
patrol in the controversial Irish Box fishing area, between western
England and Ireland, to mark the first day that Spanish trawlers were
legally entitled to work in the disputed zone.

Also on standby to monitor the situation were three commercially
chartered patrol aircraft which are used to oversee fishing fleets in
British waters.

However, in spite of predictions of confrontation, none of the 20
Spanish boats which have so far registered to work in the Irish Box
appeared.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food pointed to the holiday
season as a possible explanation and added that fishing conditions were
not particularly favourable in the area at present.

Meanwhile, arguments continued between British politicians about the
agreement, which allows the large Spanish trawler fleet to use the
area, traditionally the preserve of Cornish fishing fleets. Mr David
Harris, a Conservative MP whose constituency includes the Newlyn
fishing port, said yesterday that Spanish access to the Irish Box would
inevitably lead to further cuts in quotas, hurting the UK fishing
industry.

Mr Harris said he had written to Mr John Major, the prime minister,
arguing that more control of fishing zones should be handed back to
individual European Union member states, rather than regulated by the
European Commission through quotas.

'The end result is going to be massive over-fishing of stocks already
under pressure,' he said.

Yet Mr Tony Baldry, the fishing minister, said that Spanish boats would
not be able to catch any additional fish by choosing to trawl in the
Irish Box, rather than in other areas.

'They will be policed equally fiercely on the catches that they take to
make sure the fish are the proper size and are within quota, as much as
ensuring that there are no more than 40 trawlers at any one time in the
Irish Box,' he said.

The two men also disagreed about whether Spanish boats would abide by
the rules of the agreement to use the disputed waters.

Mr Harris predicted that Spanish trawlers would use 'every trick in the
book' to skirt the rules, while Mr Baldry argued that the Spanish boats
would comply.

'It will be a very stupid Spanish skipper who seeks to break the
rules,' said Mr Baldry. 'If he does so he will be brought into court,
he will be prosecuted and he will be fined up to Pounds 50,000.'

BIG THAW LEADS TO WATER CUTS: UK NEWS DIGEST


Thousands of homes throughout the UK were flooded and whole communities
faced water shortages yesterday as the Christmas freeze gave way to a
dramatic thaw, bursting water mains and domestic water systems. In some
areas, temperatures soared from -20C to around 7C.

In Scotland, 1/2m Strathclyde homes suffered burst pipes at some point
over the holiday. Water rationing was introduced in parts of Northern
Ireland as reservoirs ran low because of water leaks and burst pipes.
More than 100,000 homes were affected and water tankers were being used
in some areas.

The Northern Ireland Housing Executive, which is responsible for public
housing, dealt with more than 5,000 calls. Plumbers ran short of
materials and the executive had to arrange special openings of supply
stores to allow work to continue. Vast quantities of water were lost
because affected schools, factories and offices were closed for the
holidays.

Thousands of consumers in the Carmarthen area of west Wales spent
yesterday without water because of a burst main taking supplies from
the river Towy. North West Water brought in extra staff to cope with
phone calls, and other areas affected by the thaw included
Northumberland, Tyneside and Wearside, East Anglia, Essex, and Suffolk.
Thames Water said customers were cut off at various times but teams
were working to restore services. Press Association

SCOTTISH BANK HOLIDAYS

'Drop January 2' plan attacked

Scottish nationalists yesterday attacked plans to bring Scottish
banking industry holidays into line with England. The move could make
this the last traditional new year holiday period north of the border
and set a precedent for other employers, warned Ms Anne McNair, the
Scottish National party's employment spokeswoman.

Scotland has two new year bank holidays - January 1 and January 2 -
whereas England and Wales have only January 1.

Announcing SNP backing for a campaign by the main banking union Bifu,
she said: 'Once again it seems that Scottish families and society are
taking second place to English clearing banks and the London Stock
Exchange. Making Easter Monday a bank holiday instead of January 2, as
is proposed, would make no sense since demand for banking services is
far greater at Easter than at new year.' Press Association

NHS TRUSTS

Plea for help over fraud probe

The National Health Service Executive has written to all 458 NHS trusts
asking them to co-operate with a police investigation into an alleged
fraud by locum agencies.

The investigation follows routine checks last year by the Audit
Commission, the NHS watchdog, at four hospitals in north Wales.

The Metropolitan Police's company fraud unit is now investigating the
claims. It believes that up to 80 trusts could have fallen victim to
the alleged fraud, which is said to have involved charging excessive
fees or sending duplicate invoices for the services of locum doctors
and therapists. Four people have been arrested in connection with the
allegations, and released on police bail. The total sum involved is
alleged to be about Pounds 3m. John Authers

SUPERMARKET PRICE WAR

J Sainsbury offers 200 cuts

J Sainsbury fired a new year salvo in the supermarket price war
yesterday by cutting the cost of more than 200 items by up to 50 per
cent during January. The move comes three days after frozen food
chainstore Iceland announced it was reducing some prices to those of
1986. However, Sainsbury's and other leading food retailers denied that
the initiatives would trigger another round in the price war. Press

NERVES BEGIN TO FRAY OVER BUDGET IMPASSE


It is probable that the US government will still not be fully
functioning again this morning - and it is not possible to ignore the
rising tide of public and personal disgust with the wilfulness of those
on the right wing of the US Congress who have brought about this pretty
pass.

Note, from the outset, where the finger of blame is pointed: not at
President Bill Clinton, though he may have contributed to the overall
budget impasse and is reaping political benefit from it; nor at Senator
Bob Dole, though the majority leader might have been more resolute in
standing up to his party's vizigoths if he did not need them for his
presidential ambitions.

No, responsibility lies squarely with those so convinced of their own
rectitude and so insulated from the real world outside their
conservative salons and support groups that they cannot understand the
damage they are doing - not only to those affected by the longest, if
partial, closure of the federal government ever, but also, ultimately,
to their own cause of balancing the budget in seven years.

It is doubtful that the impact of the suspension of government business
will lop more than a fraction of 1 per cent off GNP. Important
industries and cities have not ground to a halt because 280,000 federal
bureaucrats have been laid off. No college football game, the opiate of
the New Year season, has been cancelled.

There has been damage, however: to the civil servants, not exactly fat
cats, unpaid for two weeks over Christmas; to small federal contractors
dependent on government; to the 20,000 people who apply for passports
every day and the 23,000 who register with social security; and to the
small towns and businesses that live off the seasonal trade of great
national parks like Yosemite in California, where the adjacent Mariposa
County has declared itself a disaster area.

They may not amount to a collective blip in the national statistics,
but their livelihoods are affected - for months ahead - and all are
some politician's constituents. To judge by their comments in streams
of US media interviews, they are mostly mad with what they frequently
call 'the clowns of Congress', and soon some poll will doubtless
measure their anger.

Perhaps more serious for the congressional right is the offence they
have given to the chattering classes, who, when aroused, can still do
much to shape public opinion. Nothing has offended them more than the
denial of unfettered access to the most comprehensive collection ever
assembled in one place of the works of Johannes Vermeer, the Dutch
master, at the National Gallery here in Washington.

Last week, Rusty Powell, the gallery's director, was able to open its
doors by releasing Dollars 30,000 from a private donor fund earmarked
for future exhibitions. This was enough to make the Vermeers - but not
the rest of the formidable standing collection, nor the concurrent
Winslow Homer exhibition - available to the public. And did they come,
with lines in frigid weather stretching round the block for precious
passes.

But the money is only good for a week, which means that unless Congress
comes up with funding for the gallery pronto, the Vermeer exhibition
cannot complete its scheduled run until next month. And, like the small
businessmen in Mariposa County, just about all the gallery-goers have
vented their spleen at Congress. One angry TV commentator suggested
that, as a punishment, the 73 Republican freshmen in the House of
Representatives be permanently barred from looking at Vermeer's
masterpieces (though the impact of such contemplation might well be
salutary).

A more severe critic could go further by noting that few of the
affected are natural allies of the hard right. Art appeals to the elite
and is often decadent; passports are for foreign travel and thus
somehow un-American; social security is for the weak; national parks
might be more profitable if opened up for oil drilling and commercial
exploitation; and Washington itself, a veritable modern Sodom and
Gomorrah, would be better off turned into a pillar of salt.

The last word should lie, surely, with the bureaucrats. While they are
on unpaid furlough, members of Congress are receiving their salary
cheques and, as is their wont during recess, travelling the globe. So a
group of US diplomats in Latin America ordered back to work to arrange
one such six-nation trip, sent this distinctly undiplomatic message to
the state department:

'Frankly, we are disturbed by the thought that while American school
children are being turned away from Smithsonian museums, national
parks, monuments and memorials, some members of the US Congress are
looking forward to seeing exotic attractions like Copacabana, Iguazu,
Cuzco, Macchu Picchu and Otavalo - largely at the expense of the
parents of those school children.'

Perhaps they should push the congressional delegation off a cliff, in
the manner of the Incas.

WHAT, EXACTLY, IS THIS MILLENNIUM COMMISSION?

   By ANTONY THORNCROFT

What, exactly, is this Millennium Commission we keep hearing about? The
body set up to plan the UK's celebration of the year 2000. Most other
countries hope to let off a few fireworks but the UK is taking it very
seriously indeed, and spending about Pounds 1.5bn.

Whose idea was it? Lord Palumbo, former chairman of the Arts Council,
thought the millennium a good excuse to spruce up Britain's national
heritage - Stonehenge, the cathedrals, that sort of thing, and perhaps
add one or two modern landmarks. Prime minister John Major agreed, and
Palumbo's idea has gathered great momentum.

Organised by a quango of the great and the good, presumably? Spot on.
Seven worthies, mixed to reflect the aristocracy, business, heritage
lobby, science and women, plus a couple of politicians (Virginia
Bottomley and Michael Heseltine) who are charged to give to it a
vote-gathering twist.

Where on earth is the money coming from? From the UK national lottery,
now a little over a year old. Projects to mark the millennium are one
of the five worthy causes that are getting great chunks of lottery
cash, along with the arts, sport, the heritage industry and charities.
To date the Millennium Commission has received almost Pounds 300m. But
unlike the other good causes, its good fortune ends on December 31
1999. After that, its share of the lottery cake will be divided among
the other four.

Hasn't the commission upset the Welsh? Yes, some of them. It was
decided to spend about Pounds 600m on 12 landmark projects, the 20th
century's gift to the future. These are to be spread conscientiously
around the UK. Wales was owed one, but the national rugby ground at
Cardiff Arms Park, and a proposed opera house for Cardiff Bay, each
applied for Pounds 50m. Forced to choose between the two Welsh
passions, rugby and music, the commission said 'No' to music and
'Maybe' to rugby. The money will probably be spent refurbishing Cardiff
Arms Park.

So all this millennial cash is not spreading universal happiness? No
way. There are as many people whingeing as celebrating, especially in
the media. The commission is accused of being short on big ideas and
long on cautious pragmatism. It has imposed severe restrictions by
demanding that applicants should be able to provide half the cost of
any project, although some of this can be in land or labour. This makes
things hard for imaginative loonies.

But some good must be coming from it? Well, the Tate Gallery is happy.
It has Pounds 50m for its proposed gallery of modern art on Bankside;
Kew Gardens has Pounds 21m for a millennium seed bank for plants; and
Portsmouth Harbour picked up Pounds 40m to convert itself into the
world's classiest marina. Scotland has been sweetened with Pounds 46m
for a 'new' Hampden Park. These are among the landmark schemes.

But I live in Twistelton-on-the-Marsh. I'll never get along to these
national monuments. The commissioners have also set aside another
Pounds 600m to engender turn-of-the-millennium optimism at the grass
roots. Over 300 groups of local activists have already received a go
ahead for good ideas. For example, there will be a new village hall for
Ingleton in Derbyshire, thanks to a millennium grant of Pounds 150,000;
a coastal railway linking the Giant's Causeway and Bushmills in
Northern Ireland will please locals and tourists, at a cost of Pounds
700,000; and Pounds 588,000 has been set aside for salmon ladders in
the River Thames.

Strengthening communities and greening the land are buzzwords the
commissioners have taken to heart. The Pounds 42.5m for Sustrans, which
aims to cover the nation with 2,500 miles of cycle paths, just about
sums it all up.

What is going to happen in 2000? Good question. No one knows, although
Imagination, a group of creative whizzkids from London, and M2000,
financed by Touche Ross and MAI among others, should have a good idea.

They are the two consortia short-listed to organise the year-long
celebration, likely to be a cross between the Festival of Britain and
Disney World. The winner will be chosen this month. Four sites have
also been short-listed: Greenwich, near London; the National Exhibition
Centre near Birmingham; Derby; and Stratford, in London.

Greenwich, the chosen venue of M2000, is favourite, while Imagination
has plumped for Birmingham.

It depends whether the commissioners go for a site in London plumb on
the international dateline, or Birmingham, near the centre of the UK.
With Pounds 100m of millennium money to oil the profit-making event, it
should be some celebration.

And on December 31 2000, is it all over? The commissioners hope not.
There will be the landmark buildings to enjoy, although there is no
equivalent to the Crystal Palace or the Eiffel Tower on the horizon to
amaze citizens of 2096. There will also be hundreds of village halls,
urban parks and small woodlands.

And there will be some bursaries, which are planned to continue ad
infinitum. What are they. Can I have one? No reason why not. The
commission is setting up a Pounds 100m endowment, which should produce
about Pounds 5m a year to be distributed in dollops of Pounds 2,000 and
upwards to citizens who want to improve themselves, and then pass on
the improvement to their communities.

More details will be announced this month, but you will probably have
to apply to a charity or a voluntary organisation for vetting. Good
luck.

MASTER OF RECOVERY EXPECTS SCRUTINY: A CAUTIOUS APPROACH TO DEBT DOES
NOT RULE OUT A NEW PHASE OF GROWTH, WRITES ROBERT CORZINE


John Browne, British Petroleum's chief executive, has marked the
completion of his first six months in office with the conclusion of a
Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.27bn) natural gas deal in Algeria.

The project, which analysts say will help turn BP into a significant
international gas company, attracted headlines mainly because of its
location in a country struggling with an Islamist insurgency. But the
deal is also noteworthy in that it will form one of the foundations for
a new phase of growth and capital investment at BP, whose last
expansive foray triggered a debt crisis in 1992 and the departure of
Robert Horton, former chairman and chief executive.

That episode still influences the thinking of John Browne and that of
Sir David Simon, BP's chairman and the man who engineered the recovery
of the company's fortunes. 'We must not leverage this company ever
again,' said one senior executive last week.

But the company says a cautious approach to debt does not mean that BP
is afraid to act decisively to ensure future growth. It has embarked on
big oil and gas projects in politically unsettled parts of the world
such as Colombia, Azerbaijan and Algeria.

Such projects are a marked departure from BP's traditional core areas -
Alaska and the UK sector of the North Sea. But during Browne's tenure
as head of the company's upstream arm, the board came to accept that
political risk is best spread across a range of projects in different
countries. 'The real risk is having too much in one basket,' says one
BP executive, 'not in going to risky countries which could have a
material effect to the company's bottom line.'

Browne also placed emphasis on the 'phased development' of such
projects. That allows the company to limit its financial exposure
during the early stages of a project, when there is likely to be
greater uncertainty about whether it will prove technically,
politically or commercially viable.

Industry observers say Browne's greatest success was in re-shaping the
strategic direction of the exploration arm and ensuring that it had a
string of possible projects to choose from. It now has sufficient
assets to ensure that reserves can be replaced for another 10 years.
That means that while many other oil companies hunt for new reserves,
BP can focus on projects that are likely to offer the highest return.

Yet analysts wonder whether Browne will have equal success tackling the
problems in BP's downstream division, the one part of the company of
which he has no direct experience and a sector in which big changes may
have an impact on BP's customer base.

He has recently devoted time to downstream issues, in particular to the
future of the company's refineries. They, like much of the industry,
suffer from thin margins and offer little scope for any technological
advantage over competitors. An announcement on the further
restructuring of the company's refining assets is expected this month.

Browne, an engineer who believes technology can continuously enhance
BP's financial performance, is upbeat about chemicals - a segment in
which proprietary technology can increase competitiveness and the
division that BP has chosen to lead its expansion in Asia.

An announcement on broader corporate aims is expected in March. There
have been rumours in the industry that Browne has contemplated radical
changes to the way BP conducts its business, with some observers
speculating that Browne, a former corporate treasurer, would like to
adopt more of a 'merchant bank' approach to the industry.

BP executives say he is more likely to maintain a step-by-step
approach, and emulate Simon by setting simple targets related to BP's
financial and performance ambitions.

One of his biggest challenges will be to maintain BP's strong financial
performance. 'You can grow from an uncompetitive base by cutting
costs,' says one executive. 'The hard task is to grow from a
competitive base, and not just capture the chemicals cycle at its top.'
That means BP will have to focus on efforts to keep margins as high as
possible even in a downturn.

Browne's strategic aim is to create a 'distinctive' company - one with
elements that competitors would have difficulty copying and one which
would provide unusual financial returns to investors. He emphasises the
importance of relationships with host governments, partners and
suppliers.

Browne also wants a 'unique' set of assets, including markets. But big
acquisitions of the type that landed BP in so much trouble in the past
appear to have been ruled out for now, although executives say BP will
continue to make small-scale acquisitions.

Browne's first six months have been made easier by BP's strong
financial performance. But in future there is likely to be greater
investor interest in how he and his colleagues deal with the narrower
issues of the downstream assets and with capital investment decisions.

Senior BP executives say investors are right to demand the highest
capital efficiency possible. After all, says one, 'the industry as a
whole has a pretty bad track record. It hasn't spent money wisely.'
What of BP specifically? 'We should expect to withstand tough
scrutiny,' he says. 'But I don't believe BP will repeat the past.'

FEATURES & OPTIONS:
FILMS FOR 1996

   By NIGEL ANDREWS

You can always tell a new movie year. It stomps into view overturning
Christmas trees and growling 'No more Mr Nice Guy'. 1996's first
audiences are invited to choose between Seven (serial killer with
horrific murder methods), The Kingdom (ghoulies in a haunted hospital)
and Four Rooms, which climaxes with Quentin Tarantino presiding over
chopping a finger.

Nevertheless, there are compensations to be found. The faint hearted
can take refuge in France's The Horseman On The Roof - more buckle and
swash from director Jean-Paul Cyrano De Bergerac Rappeneau - and in
Something To Talk About, a marital comedy-drama with Julia Roberts. She
twangs a pretty southern accent while Robert Duvall and Gena Rowlands
provide power casting as Mom and Pop.

In truth, even the nasties are not that nasty. The Kingdom, a weirdly
hilarious TV mini-series turned four-hour movie from Danish director
Lars Von Trier, is more black comedy than spine chiller. And there is
humanity between the stomach-testing moments in Seven. Brad Pitt and
Morgan Freeman play detectives sleuthing through a series of murders
patterned after the seven deadly sins.

The moral is, if you want quality cinema you must take the rough with
the smooth. But you need not take Four Rooms at all. This quartet of
stories proves there are days when even wonder children like Tarantino
should be locked in the nursery until they get the script right.

On video, meanwhile, two films allow you to be adult and childlike at
the same time. Ed Wood is Tim Burton's funny-elegiac homage to the
world's greatest 'bad' director, with Martin Landau eating the scenery
as the horror actor Bela Lugosi.

And Dianne Wiest similarly eats the scenery in Woody Allen's splendid
showbiz comedy Bullets Over Broadway. The two actors won last year's
best-supporting Oscars.

MANAGEMENT & BUSINESS FEATURES:
BIG IDEAS, BIG BOOKS: SEVEN WISE MEN GIVE THEIR OPINIONS ON THE
CHALLENGES COMPANIES ARE LIKELY TO FACE IN 1996


What will be the big management challenge of 1996? And what was the
best/most enjoyable/most instructive business book you read in 1995?

On this page we print seven answers to these questions.

Sumantra Ghoshal, professor of strategic management at London Business
School:

Challenge: Over the past few years many companies have focused on
rationalisation and restructuring. Often this has required
fragmentation of their organisations into small units and some radical
decentralisation. Now, with much of the fat out of the system, the
challenge will be to reintegrate their fragmented organisations to
pursue new growth opportunities.

Book: The Boundaryless Organisation by Ron Ashkenas, Dave Ulrich, Todd
Jick and Steve Kerr (Jossey-Bass, San Francisco).

This is a wonderfully practical and down-to-earth book that is both
idea-rich and implementation-focused. It provides insightful ideas,
clear examples and simple tools - a rare combination in the world of
business publications.

Gerry Robinson, chief executive, Granada Group:

Challenge: Not to run out of steam. The 1980s was a period of huge
growth and expansion through new markets, new technology and a global
view of business. The 1990s have been dominated by cost control, cost
cutting, streamlining and tighter management control in order to
maintain profitable growth. This must not become the main role of
management - we must also use creativity, enthusiasm, leadership and
sound strategic direction to improve a company's health and growth.

Book: I have to confess that I did not read any business books at all
last year. This is not because I feel I have nothing to learn about
business but because I did not find the time.

The most important book I read last year was unquestionably Wild Swans
by Jung Chang (HarperCollins). Reading about China's cultural
revolution is more enlightening and satisfying than reading about the
corporate revolution.

I am a strong believer in broadening the mind in spheres other than
business.

Tim Simpson, managing director, Arthur D Little:

Challenge: 'Seventy per cent of all re-engineering projects fail',
people will tell you, misquoting one of the big change gurus. My view
is not so pessimistic. Many companies have made large-scale change work
for them, and their performance has jumped as a result.

But with the recovery faltering, and markets ever opening to world
competition, sustaining this performance improvement will be the
management challenge of 1996.

Book: 1995 was again notable more for books I wanted to read than those
I found time for. But one which did hit home was the Fifth Discipline
Fieldbook, by Senge and friends (Nicholas Brealey Publishing). Ease of
reading is one attraction - it's written for browsing and provides
usable suggestions on almost every page.

And its central proposition - that learning, and particularly team
learning, is a key part of building competence in companies - is
intuitively obvious. The book goes further, suggesting practical ways
to manage the learning process and build competence faster. And it
complements Senge's earlier, more theoretical work, with much more
practical experience.

Peter Sutherland, chairman and managing director, Goldman Sachs
International:

Challenge: To cope with the effects of globalisation. Within a very
short time the world has decisively changed and management will
increasingly be required to focus on opportunities in, and challenges
from, the emerging markets that will provide much of the economic
dynamism for the world into the next millennium. An understanding of
relatively familiar cultures and relationships will have to be
augmented by an under-standing of relatively different environments.

Book: I am not proud to admit that I have virtually never read business
books (unless written by Sir John Harvey-Jones). In 1995, however, I
have read some that I would recommend.

The first of these is Corporate Level Strategy by Goold, Campbell and
Alexander (Wiley), which looks at managing multi-business companies
such as GE, ABB and Canon.

My second and third books are not business books per se but I recommend
them because, in today's world, a good manager has to be tuned in to
dramatic political change in terms of national sovereignty. Andrew
Marr's Ruling Britannia (Michael Joseph) is about more than Britain.

It is about a world in transition. One doesn't have to agree with all
his conclusions to find his opinions both provocative and relevant.

I would also include Where Did We Go Wrong - From the Gold Standard to
Europe (Faber & Faber) by the remarkable Eric Roll, who analyses past
errors in policy relating to the British economy and, above all, to
British negativism towards European integration.

Adair Turner, director-general, Confederation of British Industry:

Challenge: Growing. British businesses have got very very good over the
past 10-15 years at being lean and mean, at increasing productivity.

They need now to get better at investing for the long term, at
marketing, at creating new products. A stable economic climate should
make this possible.

Book: Not business but economics, and not one but two. The State We're
In by Will Hutton (Cape). Disagreed with lots of it and almost gave up
after the first two pages of polemic, but provocative and insightful if
you persevere. And The World in 2020 by Hamish McRae (HarperCollins),
crystal-ball gazing with insight.

David Wellings, chief executive, Cadbury Schweppes:

Challenge: The same as always. Putting forward the best face possible
on the past in order to attract investors; scanning the latest mountain
for that elusive and obstacle-strewn path to shareholder value; and
ensuring that managers of vision, tenacity and stamina are there to
step in when you eventually fall off the mountain.

Book: Neville Bain's Successful Management (Macmillan Business). Sound,
practical advice from a businessman to businessmen. Blessed relief from
consultants peddling the latest irrelevant buzzword for keeping in
shape 'corporate re-engineering' or motivation 'empowerment'.

George Yip, adjunct professor of strategy at the University of
California, Los Angeles (UCLA):

Challenge: Multinational companies will continue to face in 1996 the
challenge of globalisation and of building global capability.

A successful global company today needs the capability to access and to
transfer anywhere in the world technology, ideas, factors of
production, and other sources of competitive advantage.

In this regard the biggest challenge will be moving executives around
the world in the face of escalating costs.

Book: Strategic Alliances: An Entrepreneurial Approach to Globalization
by Michael Y. Yoshino and U. Srinivasa Rangan (Harvard Business School
Press).

Strategic alliances are a major method for globalisation and this is
the best book I have read to date on the international aspects of this
subject.

MANAGEMENT & BUSINESS FEATURES:
A PRODUCT OF POETRY: RUPERT MORRIS WONDERS HOW FAMOUS VERSE COULD BE
USED IN ADVERTISING


Readers of the Management Page may have noticed that Union Bank of
Switzerland has been using poetry in its advertisements.

'Thoughts that transcend time from Union Bank of Switzerland' have
appeared on global satellite and cable channels, featuring Sir John
Gielgud and others reading classic poems like Ozymandias, Ulysses and
so on.

The poetry was chosen, according to project manager Vincento
Travaglione, to embody corporate values of 'responsibility, openness,
courage and perseverance'.

Of course, there is nothing new about poetry in advertising. In the
early years of this century, we were regaled with gems like these: The
Onoto, the Owl and the Waverley pen, They come as a boon and a blessing
to men . .

Or the following, proclaiming the attraction of Everybody's, a popular
magazine of the inter-war years: Oh Mr Porter, whatever shall I do? I
was reading my Everybody's and got carried on to Crewe] Copy-writing
was in its infancy in those days, I suppose, which may explain why
these excruciating verses lasted for several years; and yet they were
probably extremely effective, imprinting themselves on the popular
consciousness in much the same way as the catchiest pop songs.

Nowadays, alas, advertisers are more image-conscious. You can't imagine
the Body Shop using some naff rhyme, can you? Ovaltine is the
honourable exception, resurrecting the delightful song of those 'happy
girls and boys', the 'Ovalteenies'.

But Advico Young and Rubicam, the Zurich agency which dreamed up the
UBS campaign, have been doubly smart. Not only have they regaled TV
viewers with some decent poems for a change, subtly enhancing their
client's image; they have also done it on the cheap by using authors
who are long out of copyright.

There is no end to the number of commercial interests that might
benefit from a quick glance through the Oxford Book of English Verse.

Brewers, for instance, need look no further than AE Housman. Indeed,
Ind Coope should surely consider funding an AE Housman chair of poetry
at its Burton-on-Trent headquarters.

No modern copy-writer could improve on this passage from A Shropshire
Lad: Say, for what hop-yards meant, Or why was Burton built on Trent?
Oh many a peer of England brews Livelier liquor than the Muse. And malt
does more than Milton can To justify God's ways to man. Ale, man, ale's
the stuff to drink For fellows whom it hurts to think.

Your AB audience might blench somewhat at the last line, but
self-conscious intellectuals are not usually beer drinkers anyway, so I
don't think we need worry.

Haircare has been a fruitful medium for advertisers, and yet one does
feel that there is a certain creative vacuum in this field.

Purveyors of hair bleach must despair of that stubborn group of
independent-minded modern women who refuse to emulate the models with
flowing locks on their screens and become bottle blondes. Perhaps they
should try a touch of Wordsworth: Earth hath not anything to show more
fair  .

And if that doesn't work, there's always Eliot: Stand on the highest
pavement of the stair - Lean on a garden urn Weave, weave the sunlight
in your hair On reflection, this verse might be more appropriate for
wigmakers. But that's the joy of poetry as an advertising medium. It's
so flexible.

Other products and services might not be so easy. It is certainly time
the army came up with something better than that macho stuff with young
lads driving tanks, swimming, skiing and and generally behaving like
would-be contestants on Gladiators. How about something that brings out
those unchanging values of selfless patriotism? The Soldier, by Rupert
Brooke, has the right combination of gravitas and romanticism. But that
first line is a bit of a downer: 'If I should die . .' You might as
well make it a commercial for funeral services.

Now there's a thought. Undertakers have been loath to advertise up to
now, but poetry might give them just the opportunity they need. The
words of the American Stephen Vincent Benet spring to mind: You may
bury my body in Sussex grass, You may bury my tongue in Champmedy, I
shall not be there, I shall rise and pass. Bury my heart at Wounded
Knee.

At Berry & Birnam we always respect the wishes of the departed. Organ
refrigeration a speciality. Or something like that.

MANAGEMENT & BUSINESS FEATURES:
LIQUID THERAPY FOR THE NEW YEAR


Ihave not been myself recently. Not since I filled my body with a
strange orange liquid at the start of the festive season. The incident
was quite out of character and the memory of it leaves me feeling
sheepish and puzzled even now. Lest you conclude that I went wild on
the mandarin liqueur, I should assure you that my liquid was imaginary
and that it has made me calmer, unflappable, ready for the new year.

The bizarre story began when a lady named Deborah Marshall-Warren
offered me a free trial of something called Orange Liquid Therapy. She
said this was a 'mental de-tox' session that involved hypnotism, deep
relaxation and direct suggestion to sooth all my stresses away. Halfway
round the bend with pre-Christmas strain at the time, I felt willing to
try anything. When she told me her practice was in Regent Street, that
clinched it: I could sort myself out and do some Christmas shopping as
well.

Yet when I arrived at her office, I started to feel uneasy. There was
an unnatural calm about Ms Marshall-Warren. Her eyes were red and she
looked as if she had been crying for weeks. We sat in a tiny cubicle as
hot as the Sahara and lit by a large bright globe. 'I'm going to put
you under quickly', she said. Obediently, I sat in the chair and tried
to relax. I looked at the spot on her hand. I closed my eyes. 'Feel
your calves filling with a warm, orange liquid', she crooned. 'It is
soothing, tingling, and it is moving, up, up into your knees. Feel your
knees filling with a warm, orange liquid. It is soothing, tingling. It
is moving, up, up into your thighs . .' You get the picture.

When I was full to the brim with orange liquid, I had to imagine it
scrubbing out my cares, fears, anxieties, fizzing and dissolving them
in much the same way that Domestos gets to work with stubborn household
stains. Then, when there was no more work for it to do, I was told to
picture it slowly draining out through my fingers and toes. Clean and
emptied, I was informed that I was feeling lighter, more confident,
better able to cope and happier.

Set down in black and white, orange liquid therapy sounds daft as a
brush. I am constitutionally opposed to New Age nonsense. I do not
believe in trendy miracle cures for complex problems. The sort of
stress relief that makes sense to me is to work less, drink less or to
go on holiday.

So imagine my bewilderment to find myself feeling much better after 45
minutes of semi-conscious sloshing around in make-believe coloured
fluid. Before entering the cubicle I felt tense, on the verge of
hysteria. Afterwards I was cheerful, unbothered even by Oxford Circus
in the rain at rush hour, and more or less equal to Christmas.

Yet when I tell my friends and colleagues my wonderful hypnotism story
they give me a wary look. As far as they are concerned, I've started on
a slippery slope, and soon I will be pushing all kinds of dubious
management gimmicks. I insist I am still the same person. They are not
so sure. We shall see.

1995 was the year in which the re-engineering craze died. A
replacement, developed by McKinsey and explained in the consultant's
latest quarterly bulletin is called: Do It, Then Fix It. I like this
new fad more than the old one, because it comes in words of one
syllable. The idea behind it is equally hard to argue with: companies
should work out what changes to their business need to be made, then
they should carry them out without more ado. Once done, they should
assess the result, and if it has flaws, they should swiftly put them
right. Indeed, this seems to be such a sensible way of going about
things, it is a mystery to me why companies need McKinsey to spell it
out to them.

In the middle of all the change that companies are supposed to be
undergoing, one thing remains constant: workers feel their bosses do
not have their best interests at heart.

Never mind all the empowerment, teamwork and egalitarian structures,
employees take the same dim view of their managers as they always have
done. According to actuaries Watson Wyatt, less than half believe their
company is well managed, or think that their bosses make the right
strategic decisions.

The only thing that has changed in recent years is that workers now
view their superiors as hypocrites: good at drawing up a set of values
for the company, less good at living by those values themselves.

I realise it is not for me to volunteer new year's resolutions for
others, especially as I have not made any for myself. But might it not
be time for senior managers to start practising what they preach? I
used to think that human behaviour was difficult to change, in
particular that old dogs could not be taught new tricks. But now I am
not so sure. Dare I recommend a little hypnotherapy? On second thoughts
it would only work if they wanted to change. And that, surely, is the
problem.

HOTELIER'S STARCK CHOICE: IAN SCHRAGER'S HOTELS ARE FOR THOSE WHO CAN
AFFORD CHINTZ BUT WANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT, SAYS ALICE RAWSTHORN


On paper, Ian Schrager looks like the sort of self-indulgent
businessman who is rather too self-indulgent for his own good.

He did, after all, fly 80 palm trees from Washington to the Delano
hotel he opened in Miami last summer, because they were more attractive
than the local crop. And, after taking a closer look at the sand on
nearby Miami Beach, he shipped in a ton-and-a-half of a superior
variety.

Yet Schrager is not just another architecture junkie who allows
aesthetic excess to cloud his business judgment. He can rattle off the
profit margins on almost every aspect of the Delano and of his three
New York hotels. He has harnessed his love of design to turn them into
the hotels of choice for what he calls 'the generation that wants
something different' - artists, actors, designers and musicians who can
afford four-star or five-star establishments but find them rather
boring.

The three New York hotels - the Royalton, Morgans and the Paramount -
are almost always fully booked. The Delano in Miami is so popular that
last month's American Vogue prefaced an article on other Miami hotels
by saying: 'If you can't get into the Delano . . . .'. Schrager is now
renovating the Mondrian Hotel in Los Angeles and searching for a site
in London.

The progress of his business career has been erratic, to say the least.
He made his name in the late 1970s with Studio 54, a New York nightclub
that he ran with his university roommate, the late Steve Rubell. Studio
54 captured the hedonistic spirit of the late 1970s. But in 1980
Schrager and Rubell were sentenced to 3 1/2 years in prison for tax
evasion.

After their release they opened a nightclub, the Palladium, and
diversified into hotels. Neither had any experience of the business,
but they knew what sort of place to open. 'There was no point in
opening another luxury hotel,' says Schrager. 'That end of the business
was well served by Claridges in London, the Bel Air in LA and the
Carlyle in New York. They serve room service course by course at
Claridges. You can't beat that.'

They sensed a need for a new type of luxury hotel for the sort of
people who used to go to Studio 54 - people who wanted, and were
willing to pay for, the comfort and service they got in conventional
luxury hotels, but would prefer a less formal setting more in tune with
their taste than the chintzy interior of Claridges.

They started by renovating Morgans, a discreet mid-town hotel with 154
rooms built in the late 1920s. Schrager commissioned Andree Putman, the
French designer, to refurbish Morgans in her understatedly elegant
modernist style, but they were more adventurous in their choice of
designer for the next hotel, the Royalton, which they entrusted to the
flamboyant Frenchman, Philippe Starck. Schrager worked with Starck
again on the Paramount, an equally extrovert but less expensive hotel
that opened in 1990.

Each of the New York hotels has its own character. The Royalton is the
most audacious. The Paramount is for people who love the Royalton but
cannot quite afford it. And Morgans is the most discreet. Schrager
ensures there is a difference of at least Dollars 50 (Pounds 32)
between the room rates: Dollars 250 for the Royalton, Dollars 200 for
Morgans and Dollars 100 for the Paramount. They all have an average
occupancy rate of more than 90 per cent, against the US industry
average of 71 per cent.

'Coming from the nightclub business was great training for running an
hotel,' says Schrager. 'You're selling a commodity product. A nightclub
sells the same drink and plays the same music as the competition. The
only thing that differentiates them is production values. It's the same
with hotels.'

Production values are Schrager's forte. Starck, with whom he
collaborated on the Delano's all-white interior and Alice In Wonderland
garden, is prodigiously talented but notoriously difficult to work
with. Schrager's solution is to set up a project management team of
architects, art directors and buyers to implement Starck's ideas and
bring them in on budget.

'After doing three hotels with Philippe, we know what to expect,' says
Schrager. 'We don't panic when we get these weird faxes from him.' This
system has produced some of Starck's best work. He is one of the
world's most sought-after designers who receives three or four requests
a month to design hotels, but says 'no to all of them, except Ian'.

All Schrager's hotels look expensive. The fittings are specially
commissioned and the renovation budgets seem high - Dollars 28m for the
Delano, Dollars 35m for the Royalton, Dollars 60m for the 610-room
Paramount. But Schrager is careful to buy existing hotels which will be
easy to convert. 'We replace everything, even the plumbing, but leave
the rooms intact. You can get into trouble by banging on walls.' He
says it would cost 'much more' to kit out his hotels in conventional
chintz than in a sumptuous Starck design.

His latest project is the Mondrian in Los Angeles. It was purpose-built
as a 1960s apartment hotel and is now being redesigned by Starck, who
says he wants it to be 'very, very white with one or two symbols of
colour' to emphasise the 'dreaminess of LA'. Schrager has asked artist
James Turrell to create a 'three-dimensional living art piece' for the
foyer 'so it will be like walking into an artwork.'

As his hotel chain expands, Schrager has cut costs by pooling areas
such as purchasing and marketing. He is careful to concentrate on room
rental, and licenses out services such as bars, restaurants and gyms.
Brian McNally, who has turned the Royalton's '44' into one of
Manhattan's most chic restaurants, runs the Delano's Blue Room with pop
star Madonna as a co-investor. Schrager even licenses the newsstands.
'When we ran the newsstand at the Paramount, it lost Dollars 1,000 a
month. We've given it to a guy who knows the business and it makes
Dollars 4,500 a month.'

The Mondrian is scheduled for completion in October and Schrager will
then expand outside the US. He has hunted for sites in London without
success, although Granada's hostile Pounds 3.3bn bid for Forte could
create some opportunities.

'My customers travel on a certain axis,' says Schrager. 'New York,
Miami and Los Angeles are on it, so are London and Paris. You couldn't
open hotels like mine just anywhere because there wouldn't be enough
people to fill it. And I'd put as much effort into a place with 17
rooms as I would into one with 700.'

OVERSEAS NEWS:
BANGKOK GETS TOUGH ON MOTORISTS


More than 100 people were arrested on the first day of a campaign by
Bangkok police to force motorists to heed traffic regulations as part
of an attempt to unsnarl the city's gridlock.

In Bangkok, known for the world's worst traffic jams, drivers routinely
flout the rules. Violators often slip the police small bribes and are
swiftly on their way.

Car sales in 1995 are expected to have topped 500,000, making Thailand
the largest car market in south-east Asia. But only 8 per cent of
Bangkok's land surface is covered by roads, compared to 25 per cent in
New York and Paris. Short trips in the city can take hours.

Bangkok's traffic problem is affecting the city's development. Some
foreign businesses have decided to locate elsewhere, and tourists spend
less time and money in the capital, citing their aversion to the
traffic. The campaign is part of a plan by Thaksin Shinawatra, a
billionaire businessman and deputy prime minister, who was elected last
July on a pledge that he would solve Bangkok's traffic problems in six
months or resign. Thaksin's deadline - January 26 - is approaching with
no noticeable improvement in traffic conditions.

However, the World Bank recently announced it will provide a Dollars
150m (Pounds 97m) loan to Thailand to help alleviate its traffic
problems. Maurice Le-Blanc of the bank said: 'The government of
Thailand has taken a leading role in the region in addressing
environmental and road safety issues in an aggressive manner, which to
date have proved very successful. This will further those efforts.'

* For those who can make it through the traffic, Bangkok's first
Cyberpub has just opened, providing a focus for the party-loving
after-work crowd. For Dollars 12 an hour, customers can sit at one of
10 glass-topped tables equipped with a Compaq Presario.

Getting into the spirit of things, an opening night trio of women
clicked on to a virtual dating service which bills itself as 'Your link
to true love'. As the picture and vital statistics of a young hunk from
New York appeared on the screen, one adjusted her glasses and took a
closer look.

FEATURES & OPTIONS:
POBOX AND THE MAGIC COOKIE


Which company will have the greatest effect on the development of the
Internet this year? My answer is neither Microsoft nor Netscape. It is
a tiny new company in Philadelphia called Pobox. com - spelt as if it
were an abbreviation of Post Office Box, but pronounced as the single
word 'Pobox'. Its product consists of a simple forwarding service that
is an electronic equivalent of a post office box.

The system works as follows. Customers give out an e-mail address
ending in pobox. com - like the one that appears at the bottom of this
column. When their friends or colleagues send them e-mail at that
address, a computer in Philadelphia looks up the recipient in a data
base and forwards the message immediately to their Internet provider.

This service allows people to give out an e-mail address that is
independent of where they work or where they choose to buy Internet
access. Moving from one Internet provider to another is simply a matter
of sending a message to pobox. com giving a new forwarding address and
quoting a 'magic cookie', a number that establishes the customer's
authenticity.

I have already discovered an advantage of the service. Having recently
moved from London to Silicon Valley in order to work on a book, I have
switched Internet providers. But my address has remained the same, and
messages sent to me as if I were in London are forwarded to me in
California without my having had to tell anyone how to reach me.

Yet people moving house are not the sole market. Other potential users
includes customers of CompuServe, which allows people to use only an
indecipherable string of numbers as their e-mail address.

Equally attracted will be those who are embarrassed by the cumbersome
length or strange letter-and-number combination of their real e-mail
address.

The entrepreneurs behind Pobox. com are a pair of students at the
University of Pennsylvania, still living in a college dormitory: Reuven
Bell, 23, whose subject is religious studies, and Meng-Weng Wong, 21, a
computer science major born in Singapore. The two launched their
service in early 1995, and already have 3,000 users. In keeping with
the principle that most of the best Internet businesses start off by
giving things away, the pair offer a generous free trial lasting three
months.

Thereafter, the price for forwarding mail starts from Dollars 15 a
year, payable by credit card - with the incentive of six years for the
price of five to those who choose to pay Dollars 55 in advance.

Three months is exactly right for the trial period. It is long enough
for customers to become comfortable with the service and to give their
new e-mail address to all their friends, but not long enough for anyone
to find it worthwhile to start again with a new name from scratch.

So far, 850 electronic invoices have been sent out, and almost half
have been paid. Because of a glitch in the billing software, Bell and
Wong have not yet had time to send out reminders. But early indications
are promising, and the pair claim that an automated trawl of Internet
newsgroups has turned up more than 1,000 mentions of their service,
only one of which was negative.

Whether Pobox. com will make serious money or not is too early to
predict. Its founders certainly hope so. Bell has just taken time off
from his degree to work on the business 12 hours a day, and is planning
to pursue some Wharton MBA courses on his return to academia. Moreover,
the company already has imitators: a sign, surely, that others see the
potential in its idea.

Even a modest success could have a sharp effect on the Net. It would
remove the fear of changing e-mail address that forces many to stay
with an unsatisfactory service provider. In doing so, Pobox. com's
success would make a large global industry significantly more
competitive.

* Talking of magic cookies, someone recently sent me the following
story by e-mail. A woman who had eaten a delicious cookie at the cafe
of a department store in Dallas asked for the recipe. 'We don't give it
out,' said the waiter. However, the customer persisted and offered to
pay for the recipe.

On hearing that the price would be 'two fifty', she agreed to charge it
to her credit card along with the bill for her lunch, and was then
handed the recipe on a printed sheet. Thirty days later, her Visa
statement revealed she had been charged Dollars 250.

The furious cookie lover called the company's head office, thinking
that the real figure should have been Dollars 2.50, but was told there
was no mistake.

The Dollars 250 was to insure that not just anyone could afford the
recipe. Accordingly, her request for a refund had to be turned down,
but the woman got her own back in the end.

She copied the recipe into an e-mail, which she posted to all her
friends. They posted it to their friends, and they in turn to theirs.
'I paid for it,' her e-mail said, 'so you can have it for free.'

I find it hard to imagine that the department store named in the e-mail
would behave in such a pig-headed way.

But even if apocryphal, the story illustrates the power of the
Internet. By the time you read this, tens of thousands of people may
have baked cookies according to the recipe without paying Dollars 250.
And the name of the store chain will have been blackened on computer
screens all over the world. Tim. Jackson@pobox. com

MANAGEMENT & BUSINESS FEATURES:
HOME SHOPPING TAKES A TUMBLE FROM ITS TROLLEY: ENTHUSIASTIC PREDICTIONS
OF A COUCH-POTATO FUTURE WERE PREMATURE, WRITES WINSTON FLETCHER


A funny thing has happened. Home shopping, that supposedly
trail-blazing benefit of interactive television, has fallen out of its
supermarket trolley.

Less than a year ago the pundits were predicting a couch-potato future
for us all. Sitting comfortably in front of our screens, we would surf
the stores and trawl the malls. Never again need we venture into the
rough, tough world of Marks and Spencer or Sainsbury's. We would
click-on, cruise-thru', and our cyber-shopping trollies would be filled
by techno-magic.

Well, it hasn't happened yet. But is it on its way?

The picture is confused as there are two types of televisual home
shopping. First, conventional satellite/cable channels offering
merchandise in a fairly traditional way. Second, shopping emporia -
mostly American - are burgeoning on the Net.

The more knowledgeable US home shopping gurus have long been suspicious
of the forecast explosion in their marketplace. QVC, America's largest,
highest profile home-shopping channel, mostly sells jewellery (42 per
cent of its turnover) and clothing (18 per cent). For clothing, the
return rate is about 40 per cent.

A couple of years ago QVC's then retiring chairman, Joseph Segel, said
in a notable speech: 'The number of people tuned to a particular
channel when your advertising runs is likely to be a small fraction of
the number you could reach with direct mail. The cost of running a
shopping channel is much greater than most people realise. Some system
developers and their software programmers assume that consumers are
itching to be converted from passive to interactive TV viewers.
Certainly there are some people who fit that mould. But I venture to
say that the great American public prefers just to watch television and
let someone else do the work.'

In turn, futurologist John Naisbitt's well-informed Trend Letter - a
publication understandably keen to embrace almost anything and
everything new under the sun - recently asked: 'Is the much-hyped age
of online shopping about to bloom? Not really.' The same issue of Trend
Letter reported that 'merchants on the Internet are reluctant to
solicit credit-card numbers for payment, lest hackers steal account
numbers' - a little cybernetic difficulty that has by no means been
resolved.

Nonetheless, research estimates suggest that 2m online purchases were
made in the US in the last year. That sounds an awful lot until you
remember that it equates to a single purchase by less than 1 per cent
of America's population. And Americans, particularly those living way
out nowhere, have always been catalogue shoppers, so direct marketing
has always been big business in the US.

It is a far-flung country, and even with gasolene as cheap as Coke it
doesn't make a lot of sense to drive hundreds of miles for a rubber
grommet. In other words, established home shoppers may just be
switching media, from print to Net - without new shoppers being
inveigled into the couch-potato lifestyle.

Where Americans are slow to lead, Europeans are even slower to follow.
At the end of 1994 a study of the multimedia marketplace in Europe
carried out by leading research group Inteco reported that the demand
for home shopping was non existent. 'No one in the study,' it
proclaimed, 'showed any interest in being able to order goods
electronically.'

The progress of home shopping in Britain confirms that. QVC started
with a bang in the UK but sales appear to be stabilising at about
Pounds 50m annually - not a lot with which to run a full-time channel
and supply some 300,000 customers.

Part of the reason for this disappointing growth is the result, I
suspect, of the hype attached to the phrase 'virtual reality'.
Televisual shopping, it is claimed, provides 'virtual reality'. In a
virtual reality supermarket you can whiz round the aisles picking up a
pack of this and a jar of that as you skid past the shelves. It sounds
so futuristic, so clever, that we have been seduced into believing it
would be wonderful. But would it?

It would certainly be fun once or twice, like a video game. But we all
know what has happened to the sales of video games. The problem is that
virtual reality really doesn't bear much resemblance to reality.

We encounter reality through our five senses: sight, sound, smell,
taste and touch. So-called virtual reality offers reality in - at best
- two dimensions: sight and sound. Sight is the most important single
sense involved when we go shopping. But it is not the only one.

As supermarkets are well aware, smell is all-important. That is why
they put fruit and vegetables at the front of the store, and bake their
own bread. For many products, touch is as important as smell. ('If you
don't want the goods, don't muck 'em about', went the old
costermongers' injunction, to restrain customers from manhandling the
produce).

Paradoxically, it is in the area of sight that virtual reality is least
real. If Bill Gates, the boss of Microsoft, believes that projecting
huge cyber-blowups of great masterpieces on to his walls will convey
even a tad of their artistic merit, it is as well he never tried to
major in aesthetics.

But never mind great paintings. Would you even buy fresh meats or fish,
or even fruits and vegetables, without seeing them in the flesh? If
people didn't want to inspect the goods carefully and choose the
freshest, why would they shop at the deli counter? The newest Tesco
stores now have large old-fashioned butcher's sections. And if you want
to inspect groceries before you buy them, why not shop for the lot at
one stop?

Apart from groceries, the sector that has generated most chatter among
the marketing classes - but again, little action so far - is cars. (The
marketing classes are not much interested in jewellery - not in selling
it, anyway).

Automotive gurus constantly predict that the end of the showroom is
nigh: motorists, it is said, will compare and contrast different models
on-screen before selecting their test-drive short-list. And one day,
even the test-drive will be taken on-screen.

The assumption is that video information is more appealing to motorists
than printed or personal (showroom) information. Maybe. But feel,
comfort, guidance - even smell - are important reasons for showroom
visits, and cannot be duplicated by 'virtual reality'.

Which may explain why the only area in which home shopping seems to be
taking off is one in which virtual reality is virtually non-existent -
the marketing, not of goods, but of services, particularly financial
services.

As financial products are, so to speak, invisible and intangible, they
are ideal for telephone selling. While financial service providers
increasingly use direct response television advertising
cost-effectively, their commercials could hardly be described as
virtual reality. Or indeed, in many cases, as reality of any sort.

Not that home shopping is not going to grow. It will, but it will be
slow and highly specialised. Delivery takes time and costs money. Many
people, perhaps most, will never feel comfortable with computers.
Forget those middle-class parental boasts of brilliantly sophisticated
computer-literate kids; think, instead, about all the underprivileged,
computer-illiterate kids.

Nor is home shopping quite as revolutionary as cyberbuffs believe.
Almost exactly a century ago the Victorians were opening up their own
version of the information superhighway (and with at least as much
hyperbole). The UK postal service, the railways, the telephone and the
telegram were bustin' out all over. Telegrams were described - as new
media so frequently are described by their sponsors - as 'the boldest
advertisements in modern times.'

By the turn of the century, all the great London department stores had
mail-order departments. Harrods, which pioneered home shopping by
telephone, rejoiced in the telephonic address EVERYTHING, LONDON.
Whiteley's in Bayswater boasted they could supply anything 'from a pin
to an elephant' door-to-door.

And the Army and Navy store sped huge mail-order catalogues to its
customers in every corner of the globe, carrying within their covers a
cornucopia of sumptuous and succulent merchandise. Moreover, delivery
was often a good deal faster and cheaper than it generally would be
today.

Home shopping may yet be the bonanza of the future. But I wouldn't bet
my Tesco shares on it.

ARTS & LEISURE:
GREEN TURNS DARK FOR THE STRUGGLING GOLF CLUB PRO


Peter Alliss recently observed that the average club golfer expects the
local professional to play like Nick Faldo, teach like John Jacobs and
be as good a shopkeeper as Marks and Spencer.

Very few club members realise how much of an endangered species the
non- tour golf professional is about to become, especially in Britain,
the home of golf. Traditionally, the pro has received a small retainer
from his club but earned the bulk of his living selling equipment and
giving lessons.

Yet selling equipment to club members is becoming virtually impossible
as the tiniest of retailers strives to compete against specialist chain
stores such as American Golf Discount and Nevada Bob's.

'The members don't realise what a financial strain it is to carry the
stock on a big overdraft and they can be such fickle customers,' says
Haydn Darrell, the pro at the small Devon club of Sidmouth. 'I'll see
them turn up to play with a new set of clubs and I won't even have had
the chance to match the price they've paid from one of the big chain
stores.'

Darrell's experience is echoed nationally. A recent report from the
specialist Golf Research Group predicted that the 2,400 retail outlets
supplying the UK golf equipment market will have shrunk to only 200 to
300 shops within a year or two.

'The traditional pro shop just cannot survive,' says Colin Hegarty,
head of GRG. 'The average gross turnover is around Pounds 110,000 a
year and they cannot stock the shop and survive on that kind of
volume.'

His figures show that the bigger retail outlets are growing fast, with
a matching shrinkage at the smaller end. Hegarty says the club pro has
two options: 'Get out of the business quickly: it's better to take a
big loss than stay and starve to death. Or become an Alan Walker.'

Walker is a former club pro - 10 years at the coalface - who realised
he was a doomed species in a thriving industry, so he now has a
high-volume shop adjoining his Warren Park driving range in Essex, plus
a management company looking after a nearby pay-and-play course.

Walker says that club pros have lost their retail business
'frighteningly quickly. Five years ago it was a Pounds 130,000 average
turnover with a 35 per cent margin. That's all over.'

His own shop turns over slightly more than Pounds 1m a year, but a
branch of American Golf Discount has just opened on Walker's doorstep.

'We're being hurt,' he admits. 'Teaching alone isn't the answer to
replacing lost income. Firstly, statistics show that the British are
the worst golfers in the world in terms of readiness to take
instruction. Secondly, it's too seasonal. Who's having a lesson today?'

He looked out of his office window as an arctic snow shower blasted
across the 14th green. Few issues currently occupy the Professional
Golfer's Association as intensely as the livelihoods of its 3,500
members. As a result, a PGA working party is radically re-thinking the
raison d'etre of the pro.

It doesn't help that while the public image of the golf professional is
Nick Faldo or Ernie Els, superstars like those are a light year away
from the everyday work of the pro at the local club.

When the PGA wanted a leading figure for a publicity campaign, it found
Faldo's fee unaffordable, so ended up using Nigel Mansell, one of the
game's better-known amateurs.

Alan Walker is a committee member at the PGA and is deeply involved in
the process of reviewing future direction. As one experienced insider
put it: 'We have to stop training people for futures they are never
going to have. They're not going to be Woosnam or Norman, and now
they're not going to be a successful shopkeeper, either.'

Walker acknowledges the problems. 'At the end of the day we're all
failed players,' he says. 'I went into the game thinking I could play
and was going to spend my days on the course winning tournaments, and
I've ended up an accountant.' Later this month the PGA opens an Pounds
8m training academy at its headquarters, The Belfry, the hotel course
in the English Midlands that has hosted several Ryder Cups.

Leisure management and course architecture are much more important now
than learning how to spend several hours repairing a persimmon-headed
driver for a tiny fee.

The qualifications dished out at The Belfry will be equivalent to a
degree. 'We've always been reluctant retailers, and the tour is for a
tiny minority, of whom 75 per cent won't cover their costs,' says
Walker. 'The jobs we've got to aim for are those of actually managing
the facilities, which in the past have gone to food and beverage
specialists or greenkeepers.

'In the future, if your local club pro can't drive a computer and work
the local media, forget admiring his short game around the green.'

If the pro can re-engineer himself to survive, what of the shop? We may
not buy much, but which weekend golfer doesn't enjoy a mooch around his
club shop's over-stocked shelves?

'It's history,' says Colin Hegarty. 'Marks and Spencer are already
moving into clothing in a huge way and the big chains will be selling
all the clubs and equipment. A starter's hut where you can buy a glove
and a ball - if you've forgotten to bring them - is the most likely
outcome.'

ARTS & LEISURE:
YEAR OF THE MILLENNIAL RE-THINK

   By COLIN AMERY

At least 1995 ended on a note of pure wisdom. For once, the old English
system of independent representative groups of well-informed
individuals appointed by the crown to guide our affairs worked
brilliantly, with the millennium commissioners proving themselves worth
their salt by refusing to allocate national lottery money for the
proposed Cardiff Bay opera house.

For too long Lord Crickhowell and his opera house trustees have been
led by the nose by London architectural groupies and admirers of the
designs of Zaha Hadid, who won the competition to design the proposed
opera house.

The common sense of the minister, Virginia Bottomley, and her
commissioners will save Wales the embarrassment of a design that is not
supported by the people of Wales and is already dated.

A Cardiff Bay opera house as a new home for the Welsh National Opera is
a good idea, and no doubt a large theatre will be built there. The
mistake was for the opera house trustees to believe they had to build
something approved by a narrow segment of the international
architectural mafia.

The jury for the competition was unrepresentative and innocent,
seemingly prepared to let Miss Hadid's quaintly modern period piece go
ahead even though she had never built a serious building. Miss Hadid is
really a talented futurist painter - her work would have been avant
garde in turn of the century Russia. Today it is labelled
'uncompromising' and 'exciting'. It is neither. The trendy London
chatterers who influence people like Lord Crickhowell should be seen
for what they are: rearguard types trying to protect a briefly
fashionable designer. But Miss Hadid is no genius.

The tragedy of the inevitable row about Cardiff Bay is that the failure
of Miss Hadid's design will be seen as a triumph for the philistines.
It is actually a dated, awkward design that only got this far through
endless lobbying. The millennium commissioners, who distribute part of
the proceeds of the UK national lottery, have called the bluff of the
trendies.

Sensible opera house trustees should look at the newest opera houses in
the world; meet their architects and managers; and choose someone with
experience. The trustees must start again with a good new architect.
Life is tough, but Virginia Bottomley is tougher, and in this case she
and her commissioners are right.

Last year, national lottery money gave a fillip to the UK's
architectural profession. The turnover of the British construction
industry should benefit by some 5 per cent or so in the years to the
millennium. It is large-scale projects that attract attention, but some
90 per cent of lottery grants are for projects of less than Pounds 1m.

Yet 1995 saw construction still in recession and architects only
beginning to see green shoots of recovery fertilised by lottery cash.
The secretary of state for the environment, John Gummer, belatedly
recognised the value of towns. His new planning policy guidance notes,
to be issued early this year, will stress the value of mixed
developments. That is an almost complete volte face for the entire
planning system. If he is serious, Gummer will presumably be
re-educating the entire planning profession at the new University of
Greenwich.

He will have to start with the Corporation of the City of London which,
since the inspired but disastrous experiment of the Barbican, has
abandoned any pretence that the City is more than a Square Mile of
offices. The recent announcement of two big office schemes in EC4, and
the decision to encourage Mitsubishi to go back to the drawing board on
the Paternoster site, means the City may be in danger of becoming a
horizontal version of Canary Wharf.

The opportunity at Paternoster to build a mixed development, giving
Mitsubishi the chance to build as many offices as it likes on, say,
London Wall, must not be missed. In turn, the chance to move the Museum
of London to a marvellous site next to St Paul's should be grasped, and
why not have hotels and residential accommodation overlooking Wren's
wonder?

Architects in 1996 need to learn to be different kinds of animals.
Those like Miss Hadid and Sir Richard Rogers (imminent adviser to the
new Labour party) who are wedded to dogma, are now old fashioned.
Architects like Sir Michael Hopkins, Sir Norman Foster and Richard
MacCormac are the leaders of the profession, and also admired by the
public.

That is a breakthrough, and one that has come about because the public
are under-estimated by architects at their peril. The public - you and
me - understands the difference between quality and a dead cow in
formaldehyde. Virginia Bottomley and her commissioners understand the
difference, too. In 1996, quality and common sense may replace dogma
and fashionable nonsense. I live in hope.

ARTS & LEISURE:
MAN OF MUSIC WITH PERIOD APPEAL: ANDREW CLARK TALKS TO THE CONDUCTOR
WHO CHALLENGES OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND OPENS OUR EARS TO THE PAST


This looks like Roger Norrington's year. He opens and closes it in
Salzburg, conducting the Vienna Philharmonic there later this month and
returning in December to rehearse Mozart's Mitridate for the 1997
festival. In between there will be Berlioz with the London
Philharmonic, Dvorak in Boston, Henze in Basle, Elgar in Washington,
Beethoven in Chicago, Nicholas Maw at the Proms and Brahms in Vienna -
not forgetting three European tours with his own period-instrument
orchestra, the London Classical Players.

Did someone say Norrington was a period specialist? If so, the period
ranges pretty wide - from 1600 to 2000. That distinguishes him from
most early music pioneers. And he uses the same forensic skills to
unravel Vaughan Williams and Part as he does for Beethoven and Bruckner
- which sets him apart from other high-profile conductors. No British
musician has done more to challenge our assumptions or open our ears to
the past. At 61, Roger Norrington fully deserves the international
limelight.

He clearly enjoys it. The early music revolution, he says, is not about
period instruments or a particular type of repertoire. 'It's a habit of
mind. Even if I didn't know anything about early music, I would still
be the conductor I am now. I just can't look at a piece of music
without taking it back into the garage and stripping it down, finding
what the hell is going on and putting it back together again. Vroom]'

Earthy enthusiasm has always been a Norrington hallmark. It inspired
his singers and orchestra at Kent Opera, where his 13 years as music
director gave him a vast repertory and an intimate understanding of how
a company works. Enthusiasm has also been the key to his 'Experience'
weekends, where he and the LCP discuss, rehearse and perform a
composer's work to the amused enlightenment of all. And it continues to
permeate his day-to-day contact with conventional orchestras.

'You don't often come across that kind of enthusiasm for the way the
music is realised,' said a member of the Basle Symphony Orchestra after
Norrington's latest visit. 'His contact with the players is amazingly
lively - the orchestra had a great time. He got a humming performance,
the music really took off.'

Longstanding colleagues say Norrington has mellowed over the years. He
has had two operations for cancer and become a father again: his wife,
the choreographer Kay Lawrence, and their two-year-old son often travel
with him. 'But when it comes to the music, he's just as strict and
demanding as ever,' says an LCP stalwart. 'He has an incontrovertible
idea of how it should be. His point is that this is real music written
by real people, and he gets that 'immediate' element across. He wants
to get round the traditional interpretation, demythologise the music,
remove the waffle and ballast.'

That is one of the reasons why Norrington now enjoys such a high
profile outside the UK. Long popular in the US and Italy, he has only
recently begun to make his presence felt in the Austro-German
heartland. He says CDs have had a proselytising influence - 'they're
sinking into the subconscious. People there are getting used to the
idea that there are things they need to know about. Despite my rough
German, the orchestras have been very responsive.'

Norrington has not forgotten the UK. A former choral scholar at
Cambridge, he lives in Berkshire, organises the LCP's schedule with a
couple of helpers and conducts 10 programmes a year with the London
Philharmonic. He says he is perfectly happy to work with modern
instruments. 'If you're changing the score - because many of the
published scores are inaccurate - and you change the seating, the
tempo, the phrasing, the light and shade, the Weltanschauung, it
already makes a huge difference. But once they get used to the style,
they may hesitantly say 'We're doing everything else, shouldn't we drop
the vibrato?'. That happened with the LPO, and the result was
absolutely marvellous. As they begin to trust you, they realise you're
not going to turn up in a gown and mortar board. They see you're a real
musician.'

Norrington's interest in historically aware performance began in the
early 1960s, when he went round the churches of Europe performing
Schutz with his own amateur choir. There was no Schutz style: he had to
invent his own. From there it was but a short step to Bach, Telemann
and Handel - and on to Gluck and Haydn, Beethoven and Berlioz, Schubert
and Schumann. The journey has now reached Wagner and Bruckner, and the
results astonish Norrington as much as they do his admirers.

In his LCP recording of the Meistersinger overture, Norrington knocks
two to three minutes off the standard performance length. 'I keep
thinking that with the next thing we do, there won't be quite the same
things to discover,' he says. 'A year ago, we didn't know how Wagner
would sound on period instruments. I thought the tempo wouldn't be a
big question, it would be a matter of just hearing the same music on
these instruments. Then I started my research. In Ueber das Dirigieren,
Wagner writes that when he conducted the Meistersinger overture, it
lasted a few seconds over eight minutes. I thought wow] What will it
sound like if we do that?'

It was a revelation - less pompous and more humorous than usual, with a
spring-in-the-step in the climaxes. There were similar results in
Bruckner's Third Symphony, which Norrington conducted at the Linz
Bruckner festival last autumn. He opted for the first version - the one
Bruckner never heard, with none of the 'improvements' carried out by
his pupils for later performing versions. And he delved into Bruckner's
own recorded comments, which include references to a polka in the
finale.

'What do most conductors do? They play it like a dirge. But if Bruckner
says it's a polka, it's a polka. So I take it at a steady polka speed,
which makes it sound like a dance - and the chorale suddenly becomes
singable. All I'm trying to do is put the record straight, to believe
in the past. You don't set out to prove people wrong - you start as an
innocent, asking questions, and you stumble across these glaringly
obvious things.'

Norrington says he deals with every composer's music in the same way:
'I feel it, I get as much information as I can about it, and then I do
it. I want to obey both sides - the heart and the head, they're in
constant creative tension. You can have the best intentions to follow
what the composer wants, but after a couple of days in rehearsal you
may find you're doing it quite differently - and that's how it should
be. In the end, feeling is king. It has to be your own vision.'

For the past two summers he has conducted at the Rossini festival in
Pesaro. Was there much for him to contribute there? 'The management was
keen I should continue de-cloying Rossini - no high notes at the end,
cadenzas as written, decorations with taste, tempi not too slow. He
doesn't need to be livened up, but there's more allure in the phrasing
than he's given credit for. He's usually hijacked into 19th-century
style. But Zelmira was written in 1822. He went to Vienna and met
Beethoven. These are fully classical works, in the sense that Beethoven
is fully classical.'

Norrington's journey into the past is far from finished. He visits
Prague in May to give the first historically aware performances of
Smetana's Ma Vlast. Given the chance, he would also take the LCP to the
Festspielhaus at Bayreuth - 'the right orchestra in the right hall'. He
wants to play Tchaikovsky in St Petersburg, to do an 'Experience'
weekend on Berg, and to conduct Lulu, Les Troyens and Meistersinger in
the opera house. He dreams of reviving the Early Opera Project, with
which he toured Monteverdi's Orfeo in Italy in the 1980s. 'Historical
staging is in the same state as early music was in 1960. The material
is all there. It just needs a mad entrepreneur with the right theatre.'

Norrington admits that much of what he does is guess-work: it is a
hazard of the road he has chosen to take. He may go wildly wrong at
times - that is the result of his risk-taking - but none of his
performances has ever been dull or routine. Long may it stay that way.

Local heroes (7.30pm BBC2) is a little hymn to English eccentricity,
both in style and content. Adam Hart-Davies is a one-man store of
trivia (or general knowledge as it used to called in less ruthlessly
mercenary days) about inventions of the past including laughing-gas (I
always thought invented by Humphry Davy out of sheer boredom with
Bristol; eminently likely) and a spanking-machine.

For those who remember Richard Harris' play Outside Edge, first on
stage then on television with the incomparable Maureen Lipman, the
sitcom with the same name hasbeensomething of a disappointment. Its
characters verge on the caricatured and lack that consistency that even
sitcom creations should have. Still, a show that avoids aping American
comedy and even takes cricket as its theme is worth a plaudatory
chuckle (8.30pm ITV).

Great Ormond Street continues its gripping survey of the great

TALES FROM ARABIA: THEATRE

   By SIMON READE

There is no better place to tell a spell-binding story than in the
theatre, especially around Christmas, when we are at our most
childlike. This is the motivation behind Battersea Arts Centre's
ambitious current programme 'Telling Tales'. Alongside new Christian
fables and fresh glosses on the European tales of the Brothers Grimm,
it is refreshing to experience the contrasting oral tradition of
Persia: Alf Laylah Wa Laylah - Arabian Nights: The Tales of
Sheherazade.

The excitement starts when you enter the modest studio to find it
re-formed. We sit cross-legged in-the-round, raised above the courtyard
arcade beneath, peering into a shimmering arena which transforms from
king's bedroom to bustling bazaar, the banks of the Nile and the plains
between Cairo and Basra in the tiniest flicker of our mind's eye. 'This
hot land called Egypt' is conjured from nothing more than a fistful of
sand draining through a woman's fingers. Michael Gordon's direction and
Liz Cooke's design create a compelling environment for their dedicated
company of ten focused performers. 'Listen,' they command: 'Listen.'

It is the whim of King Shahrayar to execute his virgin brides after
only one night, as a means of purging his kingdom of unfaithful Woman.
He scapegoats them because of his own self-loathing: he murdered his
first queen in a fit of ill-founded jealousy. A strong-willed princess,
the Sheherazade, is determined to end this needless sacrifice, and
volunteers to be his bride, but only after she has told her sister a
bedtime story - beautifully in Arabic - which intrigues the King. So
she tells him more.

The stories selected by the company are not of the Boys Own 'Ali Baba
and the Forty Thieves' variety, but all craftily develop the
proto-feminist theme. Each tale has jealous husbands wrongfully
murdering their wives for imagined infidelity, or women enduring sex
and childbirth, and even broach pre-ordained marriage. This
interpretation of the exotic Arabic world of the Middle Ages as one
riddled with miscarriages of natural justice against women, pursues a
clear agenda, but not one which is worn on the sumptuous sleeves of the
women. The stories are elliptical, graceful and enchanting.

There are stories within stories, tales chasing their own tales, richly
interwoven like a magic carpet. The 75 minutes of storytelling does not
only reinvigorate a moribund king, but revivifies the wider audience.
Suitable for older children, it could run for 1001 nights.

AN ABSENCE OF INFLATION: THE FEELGOOD FACTOR IS SET TO REMAIN ELUSIVE
IN 1996, SAY MARTIN WEALE AND GARRY YOUNG

   By MARTIN WEALE

By most measures, 1995 was a good year for the UK economy. Inflation
remained subdued, output grew by more than 2.5 per cent, unemployment
declined by more than 200,000 and government borrowing fell, albeit by
less than was expected at the beginning of the year. In addition, Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was able to take a penny off the basic
rate of income tax and cut interest rates by a quarter of 1 percentage
point.

This very favourable mix of growth and inflation is rare by British
historical standards and, while we think it likely to continue, there
are risks that the economy will not be as successful in 1996.

The most striking aspect of the present economic situation is the
virtual absence of domestically generated inflation at a time of
relatively fast growth and falling unemployment. This is partly a
reflection of the extent of disinflationary pressure in the UK labour
market. Since the peak in unemployment in 1993, wage increases have
shown no sign of picking up and real wages have scarcely grown. This
means that the benefits of increased productivity have been
appropriated into profit margins. These have risen substantially:
profits as a proportion of gross domestic product - at 36 per cent in
1994 - are higher than in the early 1970s.

One important question in present circumstances is whether the
surprising lack of growth in wage rates is evidence - as claimed by the
Treasury - that the sustainable rate of unemployment has fallen. In the
1980s and early 1990s it seemed that this figure was about 8 per cent
of the labour force. Certainly, when the unemployment rate fell to 5.5
per cent by 1990, there was a sharp acceleration in inflation which was
only squeezed out by the rise in unemployment during the last
recession.

Assuming productivity growth of 2 per cent a year, the rate of increase
in wages could probably rise from its existing level of 3.25 per cent
to 4.5 per cent per annum and still be consistent with annual inflation
of 2.5 per cent and very high profit margins. This suggests that
unemployment at 8 per cent is still above its sustainable rate.

It would be premature, however, to assume from this that the
sustainable rate of unemployment has indeed fallen. Unit labour costs
picked up noticeably in 1995 and in manufacturing were growing in
October at an annual rate of 4 per cent. This probably reflects the
stagnation of productivity associated with the slowdown in output. But
it may be an early indication that unemployment is reaching its
sustainable level.

If the sustainable unemployment rate has fallen, it will be possible
for output to grow for some time to come at more than its underlying
trend rate without generating inflationary pressure. This does not
guarantee that the chancellor's inflation target of 2.5 per cent by the
end of the present parliament will be met - the weakness of domestic
prices has been offset by increases in import prices arising from
sterling's depreciation of close to 7 per cent through 1995.

We expect the underlying inflation rate by the end of 1996 to be
slightly over 3 per cent. A better way of putting this is to say that
we think there is only a 40 per cent chance of meeting the inflation
target. There is also a risk that inflation will be substantially
higher if faster growth in import prices feeds through to domestic
prices.

This assessment depends on the outlook for demand, which appears to
have stalled in the second half of 1995, leading to fears that the
overall rate of growth in 1996 will be considerably slower. This time
last year the National Institute forecast growth of 2.7 per cent for
1995, and this is likely to be very close to the eventual out-turn. For
1996, we are predicting growth of 2.4 per cent, much lower than the
Treasury's forecast of 3 per cent.

Our forecast assumes that continued weakness in domestic demand will be
offset by higher export demand, helped by the fall in sterling in 1995.
Individual monthly figures are erratic, but it was gratifying to see
higher exports in November as an early indication of this trend.

We do not expect much of a feelgood factor to develop in 1996. This is
partly due to the very slow growth in wages.

There is at present much discussion about whether the economy will be
lifted by a surge in consumer spending, with the suggestion that
spending is depressed by consumer gloom inspired by fears about
employment prospects. But the truth is that consumers are behaving
perfectly normally. It looks as though they will have saved about 9 per
cent of their income in 1995 and we are expecting a similar figure for
1996. This is lower than in any year since 1971, except during the boom
period of 1986 to 1990 - and we doubt consumers are ready for a binge
like that of the late 1980s.

In spite of the pause in growth, we expect a continuing fall in
claimant unemployment to about 1.9m, or just under 7 per cent of the
labour force. This is partly due to changes in the administration of
benefits. While we expect some acceleration in wage growth, this will
be consistent with a downwards drift in the inflation rate as the rate
of increase in import prices subsides. Profit margins will stop rising,
but there will be no great pressure on them.

The main risk of this forecast is that demand will be weaker than
expected as a consequence of companies adjusting to an unintended
build-up of stocks, tight fiscal policy and possible weakness in demand
for British exports. In this event, inflationary pressure should weaken
further and we would expect to see cuts in interest rates to maintain
the economy's momentum as the next general election approaches.

In the longer term, we expect these favourable trends to continue. The
improved picture in the labour market will be backed up by slightly
faster productivity growth as the economy starts to benefit from the
recent expansion of higher education and, we hope, the more stable
macroeconomic environment established since sterling left the European
exchange rate mechanism. We can see the growth rate accelerating to 2.8
per cent and unemployment falling to 1.2m. This would not exactly be an
economic miracle, but it would at least make a pleasant change from the
years of stop-go.

Social Research, a UK research institute, and a member of the

NEITHER BOOM NOR BUST: CONDITIONS ARE NOT RIGHT FOR SHARPLY LOWER US
INTEREST RATES, SAYS STEPHEN S. ROACH


The financial markets always want more of a good thing. And that seems
to be the case in looking to 1996. It is fashionable to worry that the
US economy is soft and getting softer, and that inflation is heading
dramatically lower. In such an environment, the Federal Reserve is
expected to reduce short-term interest rates aggressively. Moreover,
with the budget deal of a lifetime finally thought to be at hand, most
forecasters expect a dramatic further rally in the bond market.
Needless to say, such a scenario hardly poses a threat to the glorious
bull market of 1995.

Our prognosis for the US economy in 1996 is at odds with many of these
presumptions. I expect neither a boom nor a bust. Real gross domestic
product is likely to expand in a 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent range -
essentially in line with what I believe to be the US economy's
underlying long-term growth potential. The case for upside growth
surprises is relatively straightforward. It is based on solid support
from three important macroeconomic forces: real income generation (at
present running above trend at 3.7 per cent); interest rates (which are
near historic lows); and the currency (which is vastly undervalued).

In such a constructive environment, I expect the US economy to show
surprisingly broad-based gains in 1996. With mortgage interest rates
down about 200 basis points over the past year, the turnround in the
residential construction sector should continue well into the new year.
And there should be no let-up in US business's record-setting boom in
capital spending.

This is a structural phenomenon - triggered mainly by spectacular
productivity breakthroughs - that should continue to be surprisingly
immune to the whims of the business cycle.

Upside surprises in the export sector can also be expected, reflecting
the combined effects of a supercompetitive US economy and more diverse
trade flows. The strong impetus for export growth in 1995 - with unit
volume growth accelerating from 4.8 per cent in the first quarter to
10.6 per cent in the third - stands in sharp contrast to widespread
fears that there will be an export collapse in a sluggish global
economy.

The good news is that the US is less dependent on its traditional
trading partners: sales to Europe and Japan have fallen to 34 per cent
of overall US exports, down sharply from 42 per cent at the end of
1990.

Finally, reports of the demise of the American consumer are vastly
exaggerated. With consumption well supported by income generation, I do
not share the widespread conviction that households are being dragged
down by excess debts. The ratio of annual debt servicing expenses to
income stands at present at 16.8 per cent, well below the highs hit in
the latter half of the 1980s. While I do not expect a consumer buying
binge, the forecast of 2.5 per cent growth in real consumption through
1996 is sufficient to account for over 1.5 percentage points of real
GDP growth.

The inflation prognosis is particularly intriguing. While I continue to
believe the cost-efficient, productivity-led US recovery remains
intact, I am now of the view that the inflation rate is slowly moving
up from its cyclical lows. The consumer price index rose 2.9 per cent
in 1995, up 0.3 percentage points from the low of 1994, and a little
more acceleration in 1996 is expected, to an annual rate of 3.2 per
cent.

I do not share the view that price stability is now at hand. The bulk
of the disinflation of the 1990s has been a by-product of an
extraordinary compression of labour costs. With productivity and
corporate profitability surging, with the unemployment rate at 5.6 per
cent, and with real compensation virtually stagnant for over a decade,
I do not accept the notion that a submissive workforce has no choice
but to capitulate further on wages.

In spite of the supposed threat of the dollar-a-day Chinese worker,
this strain of productivity enhancement has now gone far enough. The
days of asking the labour force to keep sacrificing for the noble cause
of disinflation appear to be largely over. The risk of a backlash from
workers is a growing concern - one that might have an important impact
on the sociology, politics and economics of the US for years to come.

As for the Fed, it is hard to accept the widespread conviction than an
aggressive monetary easing is now at hand.

Given the outlook for the economy and inflation, the urgency for a
further dramatic easing just is not there. Granted, the central bank
may offer a token easing in the aftermath of a budget accord. But if
market expectations of sharply lower short-term interest rates were
realised, the Fed would have to throw its traditional caution to the
wind. If it takes its commitment to price stability seriously, and I
believe it does, it is difficult to imagine the Fed turning away from
the restrictive policy bias that worked so well in the 1980s.

The budget is obviously the wild card. The problem is that it is still
business as usual in Washington. The best we are likely to see is a
plan based on back-loaded spending cuts, front-loaded tax cuts,
immunity for social security and dubious economic assumptions (for
example, that the perfect path of trend growth, low inflation and
declining interest rates continues forever). I have come to the
reluctant conclusion that the same creative mathematicians who gave us
Gramm-Rudman I and II and the great budget accord of 1990 are hard at
work today. Credible deficit reduction remains a dream, not a
certainty.

Adding it all up, it is hard to be thrilled about US Treasury bonds.
Everything good is just about priced into the market. On the chance
that a budget deal is struck - even if it is a classic smoke-and-
mirrors compromise - a final bull run to bond yields of 5 1/2 per cent
is possible.

But as reality sinks in, and the economy and inflation fail to conform
to market hopes, I continue to believe that the next big move in bonds
is back towards an equilibrium level of 7 per cent. I expect such a
correction to take place by mid-year, at the latest.

WAYS TO VIEW SUPPORT FOR STEELMAKING PLANT


From Mr George Becker.

Sir, In the US we have been reading with interest the reports that
British Steel is seeking to close an Irish steel plant on account of
subsidies that the Irish government is to provide.

In the US British Steel is seeking one of the biggest subsidies from
the taxpayer ever recorded in order to operate a steel plant in
Alabama, which British Steel is proposing to build in partnership with
an American and a Japanese company.

Support worth Dollars 250m is being sought from - and granted by - the
state legislature of Alabama in order to persuade British Steel and its
two partners to open the steel plant in the state. If built, the plant
will directly threaten the jobs of at least 3,500 steelworkers in other
parts of the country.

Without entering into the merits of the Irish steel plant's case, we
find it puzzling that British Steel is so hostile to subsidies in
Europe and so ravenous for them in the US.

Transatlantic trade and co-operation can not be built on this kind of
tilted playing field.

CANADIAN PEOPLE CAUGHT IN THE TRAPPER'S SNARE


From Ms Carla Bennett.

Sir, Thank you for Bernard Simon's comprehensive article ('Hunting for
a kinder kill', December 13). The trap research compound near
Vegreville is a ploy that illustrates how far the Canadian government
and the fur industry will go to preserve this barbaric industry.

The fur industry professes to champion Canadian native people, but it
has been the most destructive force in their history. It has exploited
them, their culture and their way of life. Native people do not
process, sell or store furs but are at the bottom of the fur industry
chain.

Because of the sympathy people feel towards the plight of the Canadian
native people, the Canadian government and the fur industry are
promoting the myth that trapping is culturally and economically central
to the native people.

Fewer than 50 per cent of native homes are fully serviced with sewerage
and water, native infant mortality is 60 per cent higher than the
average among other Canadians, and 70 per cent of natives have not had
a high school education.

Fur trapping has not and will not relieve these problems. It will
perpetuate them.

DIAGNOSING MIDDLE-CLASS ANGST


From Prof Peter Curwen.

Sir, In his otherwise excellent article on middle-class insecurity
('Bang go the great expectations', December 27), John Plender is surely
incorrect in claiming that an occupational pension is 'not an asset at
all'.

For the great majority of members of occupational pension schemes, the
pension is tied to the salary earned during the years immediately prior
to retirement and is unaffected by whether or not the company pays its
full contribution in every year.

It is certainly true that the benefits could be improved were
pension-fund surpluses to be used for that purpose, but the basic
payment is secure and does indeed form a substantial asset for the
pensioner.

The whole point about personal pensions, which yield direct ownership
rights, is that whereas the benefits are not tied to salary, and may be
much greater than under an occupational scheme, the risk element is
also much greater and hence the pensioner cannot rely upon the size of
the asset.

It is most unlikely that members of occupational pension schemes are
overly concerned about being 'disenfranchised', although they most
certainly detest those 'bosses' who manipulate their own pensions for
personal advantage.

Insofar that 'frustrated expectations' are the cause of 'middle-class
angst', it is not negative equity which is of direct concern since, as
John Plender notes, this has affected relatively few middle-class
households, but rather the possibility of falling house prices.

This is a very new phenomenon, and often accompanied by great
difficulty in achieving a sale, but it has no parallel in respect of
occupational pensions since their value is unknown prior to retirement.

OBSTACLES FACING THE SPREAD OF DEMOCRACY


From Ms Philippa Rann.

Sir, Martin Wolf's piece on whether democracies are growing in number
and influence, and to what extent democracies are less warlike than
autocracies ('Mightier than the sword', December 28) reminds me of
discussions 30 years ago on whether history moves inexorably in the
direction of communism, and to what extent communist governments would
decrease international tensions.

There are indeed powerful 'forces that are driving countries towards
representative political institutions', but there are equally powerful
forces undermining democracies from within. Democracies have been voted
out, and there is no evidence that the increasing gap between rich and
poor will not weaken many democracies.

It is curious that Protestant societies were the first to nourish
democratic institutions, and that no non-Protestant society has
sustained democracy for longer than 70 years. There is nothing
automatic about progress, and nothing inexorable about the direction in
which history will go: that will depend on the choices each of us
makes.

UK NEWS:
WHEN POLITICS REPLACES POLICY


Britain's general election campaign is under way in earnest. The
defection from the Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats of Miss Emma
Nicholson could not have been a more potent reminder of the fragility
of Mr John Major's government. The prime minister's parliamentary
majority is now down, in effect, to three. Further deaths or defections
could soon eliminate it entirely.

Mr Major appears determined to defer the election until the last
possible date in the spring of 1997, relying if necessary on the
support of the Ulster Unionists to sustain him in any vote of
confidence. Privately, opposition leaders admit that he may well
succeed in that objective. But, amid rumours of further defections,
ministers equally are obliged to acknowledge they can no longer be
certain of the parliamentary arithmetic. An autumn election is now a
real possibility if not yet a probability.

The prime minister would be wise to pay close attention to the message
of Miss Nicholson's defection. Since his leadership victory last
summer, Mr Major has been too anxious to appease his opponents by
speaking the language of the Eurosceptic right of the Tory party.
Whatever her personal motives for joining Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal
Democrats, Miss Nicholson's charge that the government has been
deserting the political centre ground finds a dangerous echo among
voters.

Rhetoric calculated to appeal to the more hardline Conservative
activists will not recover for Mr Major the support of the less
committed voters who will decide the outcome of the election. Mr Blair
has learned one of the golden rules of British politics - elections are
not won from the extremes of left or right but from the centre.

Gruelling business

Either way, the looming campaign promises to be a gruelling and
unedifying business. Politics, it seems, leaves little room these days
for policy. The normal business of government has been suspended. Mr
Major's legislative programme is designed above all to minimise
controversy within his own party and to highlight areas of difference
with Labour. Mr Tony Blair meanwhile concentrates on inflicting
tactical defeats on the government at Westminster. Those expecting
Labour to unfold a detailed blueprint for government are likely to be
disappointed.

As they make their promises and level their charges in the scramble for
votes, however, Messrs Major, Blair and Ashdown should pause for a
moment to reflect on a more worrying feature of British political life.
Politicians of all parties have rarely been held in lower public
esteem. They have themselves, mostly, to blame.

Wider developments

It is true that wider developments have contributed to a general
weakening of faith in the ability of politicians to 'solve' national
problems. Global markets have delineated more clearly the limits of
economic independence. The necessary sharing of sovereignty in Europe
has robbed Westminster of other pretensions. But to acknowledge such
trends is not to exonerate the politicians.

The important gap is not that between the limits imposed by the harsh
realities of modern life and the unreasonable demands of the voters.
The real disillusion stems from the gulf between promises and
performance. If politicians more readily acknowledged the constraints,
the voters would be more willing to adjust their expectations. Instead,
the parties wittingly exaggerate their power, promising easy solutions
to complex problems.

To take the most obvious example: the central debate about the right
levels of public spending and taxation is conducted with shameless
mendacity. One side promises painless tax cuts, the other perfect
public services. The reality is that modest rates of economic growth
will allow neither for the constant ratcheting down of income tax rates
promised by Mr Major nor the cost-free and comprehensive welfare state
pledged by Mr Blair.

It is perhaps too much to expect the politicians to mend their ways so
close to an election. But this erosion of trust and confidence in
parliament is inimical to good government and dangerously corrosive of
democracy. Ultimately, the politicians as well as the voters will be
the losers.

ITALY AND THE EU PRESIDENCY


For the fourth time in a row, the six months' presidency of the
European Union has fallen to a member state whose government is
severely distracted by domestic difficulties. It seems to be becoming a
bad habit. First there was Germany, with a general election in
mid-presidency back in 1994. Then there was France, with presidential
elections last May. The Spanish government in the past six months
managed to postpone its demise in order to complete its EU
chairmanship, in spite of losing its parliamentary majority.

Now Italy is supposed to take the chair, not even sure if it has a
government. Mr Lamberto Dini offered his resignation on Saturday after
completing his limited mandate. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro wants
him to stay on, but he is leaving it to the fractious Italian
parliament to decide. It hardly makes for firm leadership and a clear
agenda for Europe.

Those four Euro-enthusiastic governments were supposed to co-ordinate
their plans for the two-year period. They intended to lay the
groundwork for a clear-sighted and coherent inter-governmental
conference this year, which would mark another important step towards
the goal of European political union. Instead, the EU is stumbling
towards that target in a familiar state of muddle.

Spanish achievements

Admittedly, Mr Felipe Gonzalez's government in Spain achieved rather
more in the past six months than one might have expected from its
political weakness at home. It completed preparations for the IGC,
albeit with more modest ambitions than committed integrationists would
like. It persuaded the other 14 member states to agree a blueprint for
the launch of the single currency in 1999. It finalised a programme to
reinforce the fragile relationship between the EU and US. And it
organised an impressive gathering of Mediterranean states to cement
better co-operation between Europe, the middle east and north Africa.
Not bad for a lame-duck administration.

The challenge for Mr Dini, or any other head of an Italian government,
is to keep that good work going. At least he does not appear
over-ambitious. Italy has not tabled any heavy agenda of national
priorities, as other member states are sometimes tempted to do. A
successful launch to the IGC at the end of March is one priority;
agreement on a reconstruction plan for Bosnia is another. The former
should be a formality, but the latter could be a very difficult
negotiation: the European Union must be generous if it wants the peace
initiative in Bosnia to succeed, but every member state faces tough
domestic budget constraints, limiting the room for manoeuvre.

Difficult issues

There are always other difficult issues on the EU agenda which require
clear leadership from the presidency. In the next six months those
include the plans to liberalise the EU energy market; reform of the
Tacis aid programme for countries of the former Soviet Union; and
reform of the EU wine market. There is also strong German pressure for
agreement on a stabilisation package to regulate the behaviour of
member states after creation of economic and monetary union. These are
all issues on which Italy has clear national interests, and on which a
weak government in Rome may find it difficult to compromise, let alone
negotiate a deal.

A strong Italian government is out of the question for the foreseeable
future. At this moment, early elections would not solve the problem:
under the present electoral laws, they are unlikely to produce a result
much different from the present stalemate. President Scalfaro is right
to urge the main political factions to stop bickering and agree on a
programme of essential constitutional reforms. That could be enacted by
a broad-based cross-party coalition, as Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the
former prime minister, appears to favour - though this seems somewhat
unrealistic.

Alternatively, Mr Dini could be asked to serve on for another six
months, dedicated to the EU presidency and to securing the
constitutional reforms. That would be an acceptable compromise, in the
interests of Italy and Europe.

EUROPE UNLOCKED FOR DEALERS: ON THE FIRST DAY OF TRADING UNDER NEW
RULES BREAKING DOWN EU BORDERS, JOHN GAPPER AND RICHARD LAPPER ASSESS
WHO THE WINNERS AND LOSERS WILL BE


This morning NatWest Securities will commence trading on the Swedish
Stock Exchange from its offices in the City of London. For the first
time, the stockbroking arm of the British bank will buy and sell shares
in Swedish companies without having to do so through local brokers. 'We
can sit in London with a screen on our desks, and trade as if we were
in Stockholm,' says Mr Scott Dobbie, chairman of NatWest Securities.

The ability to trade securities across borders in this way is a product
of the European Union's Investment Services Directive (ISD), which
takes effect today. The directive aims to give Europe's thousands of
broking firms a 'passport' to trade anywhere in the Union, and is
accompanied by the Capital Adequacy Directive (CAD) which imposes fresh
capital requirements.

Progress in implementing the two directives is likely to be slow - by
December 31, only seven of the 15 EU states had passed the necessary
legislation. But whatever the delays, the changes are happening faster
than previous efforts to harmonise banking supervision. 'It is far more
complex, and it is having to be accomplished in a much shorter time,'
says Ms Jane Welch, head of legal advice at the UK Securities and
Investments Board.

And the impact on Europe's stock exchanges and derivatives markets will
be far-reaching. The directives are likely to favour larger investment
banks and stock exchanges, at the expense of smaller firms and
exchanges.

There are two key measures in the Investment Services Directive. The
first is that firms will be able to operate in any EU member state,
provided they are regulated in one of them. When operating outside
their home countries, they will be subject to rules on the conduct of
business devised by the local regulators for all banks and brokers.

For the larger banks already operating in more than one EU country, the
'passport' rule will reduce costs and ease the regulatory burden.
However, the directive is unlikely to make a significant difference to
their operations. Although there have been instances of member states
imposing strict requirements on foreign banks, most of them have been
able to operate where they want. 'We have never felt constrained about
crossing national borders,' says Mr Wilco Jiskoot, senior executive
vice-president for merchant banking at ABN Amro, the Dutch bank.

But for smaller firms operating in countries with no regulation for
securities traders, the directive will mean being regulated for the
first time - together with the accompanying costs, even if they are
operating purely in their domestic markets. They are also likely to
lose the share of commission and fees they make in carrying out local
business for large investment banks. From today smaller brokers will
have to find a substitute for such earnings if they are to survive.

The second key measure of the directive is to allow stock exchanges and
futures and options markets to trade throughout the EU. With increasing
volumes of equity dealing, derivatives business and bond market
transactions carried out electronically, this should in effect allow
brokers to conduct business from offices located anywhere in Europe.

The effect will be to increase competition between Europe's 32
securities exchanges and 24 derivatives markets. Already, for example,
the Deutsche Borse, which runs the German stock and derivatives
markets, plans to extend its electronic network to several other
countries. Early this year it is opening an access point in London,
which will reduce the telecommunications costs for London-based
Deutsche Bo rse members to transact their business directly with
Frankfurt.

It is widely expected that many smaller exchanges could fold as these
pressures intensify. Mr Gerard Pfauwadel, chairman of the Matif, the
Paris-based futures market, expects a wave of restructuring with some
derivatives markets disappearing, either through merger or takeover.
'It will mean some substantial modification in the landscape of futures
and options exchanges in Europe,' he says.

Matif is planning to launch an ambitious joint electronic network with
the Deutsche Borse and two other French exchanges later this year which
would allow traders to deal in French and German equities over the same
screens. It would also cover a range of futures and options products.
'With the prospect of a single currency it all amounts to a new big
bang in Europe as far as the markets are concerned,' says Mr Pfauwadel.

One target for European exchanges such as Paris and Frankfurt is likely
to be the London Stock Exchange's Seaq-I electronic bulletin board,
which marketmakers use to advertise large blocks of European shares for
purchase and sale. Already, European bourses which have invested a
large amount on modernising their trading and settlement systems have
won back dealing business in local equities from Seaq-I.

But many market participants argue that large exchanges - particularly
London - are likely to gain rather than lose from the directive.
NatWest's strategy of trading increasingly on local exchanges rather
than on Seaq-I does not lessen its commitment to its main base in
London. Remote trading on overseas exchanges could help London's role
as the physical location from which traders operate by electronic
means.

Mr Giles Vardey, director of markets development at the London Stock
Exchange, argues that remote trading is now 'commercially inevitable'.
Mr Vardey accepts that competition from large exchanges will intensify,
but says smaller exchanges could suffer. 'Trading power is likely to
become concentrated in London, and the directive will hasten this
process,' he says.

The most immediate effects of Capital Adequacy Directive are likely to
be felt by the investment banks. They will be required for the first
time to allocate capital to cover risks of losses through adverse
movements in the markets for shares, bonds or currencies. At the
moment, banks have to allocate capital only to cover lending risks
under the 1988 Basle accord of international supervisors.

The new rules also demand that banks and securities firms monitor their
risks at all times keeping a permanent watch on large exposures. For
example, trading exposures to a single customer will have to be limited
in most cases to less than 25 per cent of capital base - and can only
be exceeded with the national regulator's permission. The larger banks
are best placed to comply with such demands, having invested huge
amounts over the past few years in systems to allow them to monitor
their exposure.

Smaller banks are less prepared. 'Developing the ability to spot large
exposures across the business is a significant headache for many
players,' says Mr Arun Aggarwal, partner in treasury and capital
markets at Price Waterhouse, the accountants. 'It imposes a level of
integration that only the top few players have.'

In theory, the Capital Adequacy Directive could lead to some banks
having to set aside significantly more capital. But most banks believe
that the directive's impact will be minimal. Mr Ian Linnell, banking
analyst at Standard & Poor's, the credit rating agency, says for most
the impact has been 'neutral to marginal', and believes that some banks
will be able to operate with less capital than before.

However, there could be extra burdens for those banks which are heavily
involved in equities trading, for which Capital Adequacy Directive
rules are stiffer in some cases. For example, BZW, the investment
banking arm of Barclays, will have to put aside a little more capital,
according to Mr David Band, chief executive.

But the biggest impact so far has arisen from the need to invest in
upgrading technology to comply with the directive's requirements to
monitor group operations globally. Some of the bigger banks have spent
up to Pounds 5m on systems and software, and even the smaller firms
face minimum costs of Pounds 50,000 to pay for software. Mr Band says
there has been a shortage of technicians in London able to work on bank
systems. 'That has been a big problem for the market,' he says.

As the directives come into action this morning, the immediate
beneficiaries look to be the large investors who increasingly trade
across European borders and are likely to see a reduction in charges.
In the longer term, the winners will be the large investment banks,
many of which are now based in London. The losers will be the smaller,
less efficient brokers and the smaller exchanges that cannot find a
role as the EU's stock and derivatives markets become increasingly
integrated.

NATWEST SEEKS TOP GUN


* What will the NatWest Group do with Dollars 3.6bn that it is raising
from the sale of its US retail banking business to Fleet Financial? Not
so long ago NatWest was the biggest of the Big Four UK banks. Now it is
the smallest. So the money should come in handy helping fulfil its
ambition to transform NatWest Markets into one of the top 10 global
investment banks.

Although NatWest appears to have ruled out bidding for a a well-known
Wall Street name, like Lehman Brothers, it will have to buy something,
or someone, if it wants to be a serious player in the big league. In
October it paid a hefty Dollars 135m for Eric Gleacher's five-year-old
US mergers and acquisition boutique. Gleacher, 55, made his name
running Morgan Stanley's M&A department during some of the biggest
hostile takeover battles in the 1980s. Now he has made his fortune by
selling out to NatWest.

As long as Gleacher hangs around, NatWest Markets has a chance of being
taken seriously in the domestic US investment banking market. However,
Gleacher is not an international player and NatWest Markets desperately
needs to beef up its global investment banking team if it wants to
compete with Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley etc.

Hence the owners of some European corporate finance boutiques must be
hoping that NatWest will be as generous to them as it was to Gleacher.
After all, when Morgan Grenfell was looking for a new chief executive
in 1987, it had to pay Pounds 15m for John Craven's Phoenix Securities
to secure Craven's services.

The obvious UK candidate is Hambro Magan's George Magan who worked for
Morgan Grenfell before starting his own boutique in 1988. He is a good
five years younger than Gleacher and has an equally impressive record
in the UK M&A market. But would Magan join NatWest Markets for less
than Gleacher?

Surely not. Once again NatWest may have to make do with second best.

Car maintenance

* What do you call a Trabant on top of a mountain pass? A miracle. And
what do you call a Yugo which looks like a submarine? A work of art.

Motorists stuck with unloved and unwanted Yugos, products of of the now
defunct Yugoslavian motor industry, can take heart. Kevin O'Callaghan,
a lecturer at the School of Visual Arts in New York City, has bought 39
abandoned Yugos for his art class. After six weeks tinkering they go on
display at this week's Los Angeles Auto Show.

The only thing that the exhibits have in common is that they can no
longer be driven. Apart from a submarine, the students have turned the
cars into such items as a giant telephone complete with push-button
numbers and handset; an accordion; a confessional - complete with
crosses; a grand piano which actually plays, and even a portable loo.

Collect call

* Who says Serbia's president is above the law? The home phone of
Slobodan Milosevic was disconnected last month because the bill went
unpaid while he was in Dayton negotiating a peace settlement for former
Yugoslavia.

However, justice was done in the end. According to Nasa Borba, a local
newspaper, the telephone company employee was fined 10 per cent of her
monthly wage, because she had failed to notice that the phone was on a
'protected list' registered in the name of the ruling Socialist party.

Honour guard

* Another New Year's honour's list has come and gone and dear old
Andrew Buxton, Barclays' chairman, has still not picked up his
knighthood.

There are lots of other good guys, such as the chief executives of
Shell and SmithKline Beecham, who have not got their Ks. But Buxton is
different. He is a chairman of one of the top dozen companies in the UK
and all his fellow chairman have titles. What has he done wrong?

Whether Buxton deserves a knighthood after 33 years with Barclays is
neither here nor there. But the latest honours list just goes to show
how little progress has been made in tidying up the present system of
honours for business folk.

Peter Wood, who created Direct Line, gets a CBE, whereas Graham
Kirkham, a fellow entrepreneur, gets a knighthood. Alan Jackson, the
departing chief executive of BTR, gets nothing. But Malcolm McIntosh, a
fellow Australian, gets his K for keeping down the cost of the Ministry
of Defence's weapons bill.

One can only hope that the leaders of big business who have not got
titles turned them down. But one suspects not.

Car wars

* South Africa has a problem. With one serious crime committed every 17
seconds it is getting a reputation as the most dangerous country in the
world which is not at war. However, it is also starting to make a name
for itself as a testbed for new measures to combat crime.

A group of insurance brokers has come up with a novel tip for motorists
when attacked by armed hijackers at a traffic intersection. Ram the car
in front. The hope is that the fuss will scare off the hijackers.

Great idea. The snag is that South Africa's hijackers already use the
same tactic to tempt drivers out of their vehicles. So when a motorist
receives a bump up the rear, it is either bad news or very bad news.

Safety first

* How do Eskimos cope with the snow?

They grit their teeth.

OVERSEAS NEWS:
EU STATES SLOW TO ADOPT DIRECTIVE ON INVESTMENT: ONLY SEVEN COUNTRIES
READY FOR CROSS-BORDER REFORM

   By ANDREW JACK in Paris with ANDREW FISHER in Frankfurt, ANDREW

   PARIS, FRANKFURT, MILAN, BRUSSELS


Only seven of the European Union's 15 member states were ready to
implement the Investment Services Directive when it came into effect
yesterday, the European federation of stock markets reported.

The directive is designed to allow non-bank investment groups to carry
out several activities more easily across borders.

It aims to create a 'passport' system allowing an institution regulated
in one EU country to operate in all the others without having to comply
with additional requirements.

Stock market officials in some countries say they have restructured and
are ready to meet the requirements of the directive but their
governments have not yet passed the necessary legislation. Other
governments have expressed concern about accepting the 'passport'.

Market officials say the seven which have to all intents and purposes
met the requirements of the directive on time are the UK, the Republic
of Ireland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Luxembourg and Belgium.
In some of these, however, the legislation itself still needs to be
passed. Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and France are expected to
introduce the legislation by the middle of this year. Germany, Greece
and Spain will not be prepared for full implementation until 1997.

Some countries such as France and Italy have used the enabling
legislation for the directive to push through broader financial
regulatory reforms, which has held up progress.

There are already strong links between the Frankfurt and Paris
derivatives markets which are expected to deepen in the coming months,
but the directive should extend links throughout Europe.

In Germany, this will create considerable new work for the Federal
Supervisory office for Securities Trading (BAWe), which was set up only
a year ago to root out insider traders and enforce compliance with
stricter disclosure requirements. Analysts believe the main effect of
the directive may be less to encourage financial institutions to open
offices in other countries than to change the location of where
transactions are carried out - reinforcing the position of those
markets which already have the greatest liquidity for any particular
security.

Mr Giuseppe Zadra, director general of the Italian banking association,
said he feared the focus of trading in Italian instruments could shift
to other markets if his country's institutions did not invest and
modernise. 'National markets don't have a future, and that's why they
will have to be changed and compete on a European scale,' he said.

The new rules have also raised fears there will be new risks for
investors because institutions receiving their passport in the country
with the weakest regulatory requirements will be able to obtain
recognition elsewhere.

'I have already heard anecdotally that some dubious firms from outside
Europe are looking for the best place to get initial authorisation,'
said one stock market official. 'The strength of the whole will rely on
the standards imposed by the least experienced regulator.'

CHANGES SOUGHT IN TERRORISM INSURANCE FOR CITY

   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent

Reform of the government-backed terrorist insurance scheme, which was
introduced after the 1992 IRA attack on the City, is being urged amid
fears that some companies may be inadequately covered.

The Association of Insurance and Risk Managers is worried that
businesses are having to pay excessively high premium rates, which are
forcing them to make a difficult choice between buying cover or risk
having to bear the cost of a terrorist incident.

Insurance industry estimates suggest that less than half of those
businesses which buy commercial property insurance purchase full
terrorism cover, although many have their own 'captive' insurance
companies providing dedicated insurance cover. Others could cover the
cost of an incident from other resources.

However, Ms Ina Barker, executive director of the association, said:
'The danger is that a lot of big businesses do not have enough
terrorism cover and are therefore putting business at risk.' Such fears
could intensify if the IRA ceasefire broke down.

Airmic hopes to hold talks with the Department of Trade and Industry
about possible reform to Pool Re, the state-backed mutual reinsurance
company. This was set up in 1993 to ensure that conventional insurance
companies could provide terrorism cover to commercial clients.

Pool Re members - which include most of the main UK-based commercial
insurance providers - have to provide terrorism insurance on fixed
terms and rates. Premiums collected by insurers are pooled and used to
pay any claims. If Pool Re runs out of money, the government would make
up the shortfall.

Since the IRA ceasefire was announced last year, premium rates have
fallen. But buyers and brokers say the system remains inflexible and
expensive.

Airmic is proposing a scheme in which all commercial property policies
would include a flat contribution towards the costs of Pool Re,
allowing a return to the automatic provision of cover against terrorist
attack. Debate in City, Page 7

PENSION FUNDS RAISE RETURNS BUT MISS OUT ON BIG US GAINS

   By GEORGE GRAHAM

UK pension funds recovered from their poor performance in 1994 with
investment returns averaging 19 per cent last year, according to a
survey by the WM Company.

Pension funds benefited from a return of almost 24 per cent on UK
equities, which make up more than half of their portfolios.

But they missed out on the big gains in the US stock market, which
returned 33.8 per cent last year. Only 4.3 per cent of the Pounds 380bn
of funds measured by WM was invested in US equities.

'Everybody thought the US was overpriced at the end of 1994 but it
really took off,' said Mr Peter Warrington, a director of WM, which
specialises in performance measurement.

He added that the longer-term performance of UK pension funds
demonstrated consistently impressive results. Whether measured over
five years or 20 years, they showed the same average annual return of
15.3 per cent, nearly twice the rate of inflation.

'In the mid-1980s, people were saying that equities couldn't go on
producing these high returns. We had disappointing years in 1990 and
1994, but over five years there is still a positive return of 16.7 per
cent on equities,' Mr Warrington said.

Property has proved a more disappointing investment for pension funds.
Although it was the best-performing sector in 1994, in 1995 property
produced a return of only 5.3 per cent, compared with a return for all
other sectors of 20.1 per cent. Over five years, property returns have
averaged 6.0 per cent, and property sank to 5.1 per cent of total
pension fund assets at the end of the year.

WM's survey, which covers about 80 per cent of UK pension funds,
reveals little change in the mix of assets held by managers, despite
widespread discussion of a tendency to 'rebalance' portfolios with more
fixed-income investments and less equity.

Some actuaries and investment managers have argued that pension funds
are maturing, with fewer members now actively contributing and more
receiving benefits. That should mean funds will increase bond holdings
to provide a more guaranteed stream of income.

But the funds measured by WM held 77.5 per cent of their portfolios in
equities last year compared to 76.6 per cent at the end of 1994.
Holdings of UK and overseas bonds, other than index-linked, also
increased, but only to 9.9 per cent.

'All the talk we have heard about funds maturing and moving into bonds
hasn't materialised,' said Mr Warrington.

FINANCE:
GOING FOR GROWTH: THE LEX COLUMN


It is perfectly reasonable to feel sanguine about the prospects for the
world's main financial markets in 1996, but it is difficult to get
excited. Inflation is low and apparently under control; growth may have
slowed, but most economies will still expand this year; and the US
economy's soft landing looks convincing enough.

But after last year's bull run, there is much less to go for. In 1995,
inflation fears proved overdone, allowing interest rates to be cut. The
resulting bond market rally, coupled with bid activity, fuelled
advances in stock prices.

Even though there are more interest rate cuts to come, the pace is
slowing and much of the benefit is already priced into both bonds and
stocks. Furthermore, the US market, which led the way last year, looks
rather overvalued. The stock market, having risen more than 30 per cent
last year, faces a proliferation of earnings downgrades. Since earnings
are not likely to fall off a cliff, a slowdown in economic growth does
not necessarily mean stock prices will stall. But the market looks
expensive relative to trend earnings and bond yields. Dividend yields
are low, even when share buy-back programmes are taken into account.
The benign economic environment probably rules out a 1987- style crash,
but a correction is not only likely, it would probably be beneficial.
And there are several potential triggers: the US budget agreement, for
example, has still to be thrashed out.

Europe

A correction in the US would hit the UK hardest, since it has benefited
most from the bull run. Although strong earnings growth is likely to
continue into 1997, the UK has other problems, including the growing
possibility of an early election, as the Conservative party's majority
dwindles. In fact, Prime Minister John Major is likely to hold on to
power until 1997 even without a majority, but any weakening of his
control over the election's timing will be viewed as a negative by the
stock market.

The UK also has more to fear from inflation than most other markets,
given its relatively rapid economic growth and an expected rise in
consumer spending. This will benefit some sectors, such as
housebuilding and retailing, but the danger is that any further rate
cuts in the first half of the year will have to be reversed in the
second - or worse that the government may try to ignore overheating of
the economy, since raising rates in the run-up to the election would
hardly be politically expedient. With gilts currently yielding twice as
much as equities, the balance looks about right. But inflation jitters
could cap gilt prices, halting further equity advances.

Further bid activity, as in the US, will help underpin stock market
prices, but estimates that the FT-SE 100 index, whatever early gains it
makes, will end the year around 3,750, less than 100 points above its
current level, are probably sensible.

In continental Europe, the problem is too little growth. This bodes
well for bonds. Even without further short-term rate cuts in Germany,
there is room for bond yields to fall. More generally, any signs that
the structural problems of high social spending and unwieldy budget
deficits are being addressed should encourage investors. Bunds and
other European bond markets may well outperform the US market in 1996 -
the problem is the strongest outperformance is often on the way down,
so it may be safer to bet on yield differentials than on absolute price
movements.

Japan

Tokyo's Nikkei-225 has ended the year roughly where it started, just
below 20,000, inviting the question of whether US and European fund
managers are right to increase their weighting in Japan. Few markets
have performed as well over the past six months. The index has gained
37 per cent since its July low, though the yen's decline over that
period has eroded more than half that gain when measured in dollars.
Currency risk will continue to bedevil foreign investors as economic
recovery sucks in more imports, further driving down the trade surplus.
But the attraction of Japan in 1996 is that it is the only leading
market set to benefit both from the early stage of an economic revival
and a pick-up in corporate earnings. A rise in sales should kick in, on
top of the margin improvements achieved over the past year.

On the surface, much of this recovery has already been discounted, with
the index standing at around 83 times prospective earnings - high even
by Japan's historical standards. However, a more useful guide to the
Nikkei's value is the ratio between equity and bond yields. Currently,
Japanese government bonds yield 1.5 times as much as equities, well
below the long-term average. As a result, Japanese institutions, heavy
net sellers of equities last year, may well favour equities over bonds
in 1996. The top Japanese life insurers and brokers have shed recent
pessimism and forecast a 1996 high for the Nikkei in the mid-20,000s.
They may be right.

Emerging markets

Emerging markets look cheap. On most valuation measures, a rebound is
already overdue. Last year's lacklustre performance partly reflects the
crisis of confidence following the collapse of the Mexican market at
the start of the year. In fact, international investors had little
reason to take the higher risks associated with emerging markets. US
fund managers in particular were able to make impressive returns in
their own domestic market.

But there are signs that US money is starting to move offshore again.
As fund managers are forced to look for growth outside the domestic
market, emerging markets are bound to get at least some of that money.
Typically, US managers have looked south of the border. But there are
still good reasons for avoiding Latin America, not only because of the
dire economic problems which continue to afflict some countries. The
main bond market is the dollar-denominated Brady bond market, which
would suffer from a US market correction. Slow growth, particularly by
emerging markets standards, makes stock markets relatively
unattractive, given the associated currency risk.

Asian stock markets look a better bet. Not only does Asia enjoy strong
economic growth and a cash surplus; the markets are likely to benefit
from funds from Japan, as well as the US and UK.

CHRISTMAS BRINGS CHEER TO TRADING STATEMENTS: UK RETAILERS

   By NEIL BUCKLEY

Expect to hear news of another strong Christmas as large retailers make
their January trading statements, writes Neil Buckley. Christmas
accounts for a large part of many retailers' annual profits. Reports of
a buoyant December and good start to the post-Christmas sales have
breathed life back into a sector depressed by gloomy results in the
autumn.

Three retailers thought to have had the liveliest festive seasons -
Argos, Dixons and Next - report next week. Argos should unveil a total
sales increase in double digits for the third Christmas running, while
Next is expected to have at least maintained the 10 per cent increase
reported in September. Dixons is forecast to report a 10 per cent
increase in like-for-like sales, which exclude new store openings, over
Christmas.

Also reporting the same week are Boots and Sears. In the former, strong
performances from Boots the Chemists and Halfords will be tarnished
slightly by sales declines in Do It All, and the Fads/Homestyle home
decorating business. For Sears, total sales are expected to be slightly
up, but like-for-like sales down.

The following week, Body Shop, Storehouse and Marks and Spencer are
forecast to report sales increases of at least 5 per cent. At House of
Fraser a like-for-like increase of perhaps 3 per cent is expected.

One year after the poor trading statement that sparked the departure of
four directors, Kingfisher is expected to reveal recoveries in
Woolworths and Comet, but falling sales in Darty, the French electrical
chain.

WH Smith is forecast to report a Christmas sales increase of up to 7
per cent in its interim results on January 24, while Burton, at its
annual meeting the following day, is expected to announce a continuing
improvement in sales and gross margins.

GREENBURY GUIDELINES WILL BE PUT TO THE TEST: OTHER COMPANIES

   By WILLIAM LEWIS

The Greenbury committee's report on executive pay will move into the
spotlight in January and February, with the publication of a
consultation document and several companies' annual meetings held under
Greenbury rules for the first time, writes William Lewis.

Next Monday, a consultation document on possible methods for disclosing
the true value of directors' pensions will be launched. The Faculty of
Actuaries and the Institute of Actuaries, together with the Stock
Exchange and the Department of Trade and Industry, are to send the
paper to public companies and are seeking their views by February 9.

The Greenbury committee's report, published in July, recommended that
pension costs be disclosed to shareholders to reflect the value to the
individual as well as the true cost to the company.

The Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries put forward a
preferred method but there were calls for wider consultation.

Many companies feared that directors' remuneration could appear to
increase by startling amounts under the new code. The consultation
document will include a number of options - including allowing for the
'smoothing' out of the effects of Greenbury.

Other Greenbury recommendations have already been put in place by some
companies and are due to be tested at annual meetings in the next few
weeks.

Bass and Burton, in their annual reports sent to shareholders last
month, were the first companies to give a separate remuneration
committee report on executive pay. Both companies' remuneration
committee chairmen will be answering shareholder questions on pay at
the meetings on February 8 and January 25 respectively.

Greenbury also recommended that companies seek shareholder approval for
new long-term incentive schemes. Burton and Capital Radio on January 17
will ask shareholders to vote through new schemes for executives at
their annual meetings.

Following the rule changes announced in the November budget regarding
the taxation of executive share options, Euromoney and Berisford are
asking shareholders to approve changes to their executive share option
schemes. Berisford's meeting is on January 22 and Euromoney's is on
January 18.

* Cable and Wireless: At an extraordinary general meeting on January
15, shareholders in the UK-based telecommunications group will have the
opportunity to question the board on the abrupt departures of the
chairman, Lord Young of Graffham, and Mr James Ross, chief executive.

The purpose of the EGM, however, will be to change the company's
articles to allow a non-British citizen to hold one of these top jobs.
This would allow the New Zealand-born finance director, Mr Rod Olsen,
to act as chief executive until a replacement is found.

* US companies: US investors are looking forward to some good news this
month as most companies start reporting their 1995 earnings figures.
Throughout the year, the quarterly numbers have produced pleasant
surprises, with results often beating analysts' estimates.

Analysts prefer to look at the 'operating earnings', excluding one-off
charges.

Forecasters expect the S&P 500 companies to announce earnings per share
totalling about Dollars 38 per share compared with Dollars 32 in 1994,
a rise of nearly 20 per cent.

* Banco Santander: Mr Emilio Botin, chairman of Spain's largest banking
institution, announces the group's 1995 consolidated results later this
month, writes Tom Burns in Madrid.

Santander raised its attributable profits after minorities by 5.9 per
cent to Pta63.3bn (Pounds 334m) in the first nine months of 1995, ahead
of market expectations, and said it had absorbed the impact of the
troubled Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), which it acquired in 1994.

* Fokker: Negotiations on a capital injection for the loss-making Dutch
aircraft maker are due to resume early in the new year, but there is no
indication when the rescue plan may be agreed.

Daimler-Benz Aerospace (Dasa) of Germany, the controlling shareholder,
and the Dutch government, a big minority shareholder, failed to agree
the package, believed to be worth more than Fl2bn (Pounds 808m), before
the end of 1995.

FORTE TO EXPAND THROUGH MERIDIEN

   By DAVID BLACKWELL

Forte, the UK's biggest hotels group, is planning a further 26 Meridien
Hotels in a push to expand internationally.

The move is expected to be announced in today's final defence document
against the Pounds 3.3bn hostile bid from Granada Group, the
television, catering and leisure group.

Forte is also likely to promise a special dividend or share buy-back if
the Pounds 1.05bn sale of its roadside businesses to Whitbread goes
through. Last week, the group agreed to sell its Little Chef and Happy
Eater roadside restaurants, Welcome Break motorway service areas and
Travelodge budget hotels to the UK brewing and leisure group. The deal
is conditional on the failure of Granada's bid.

The document is expected to include a promise to increase annual
dividends, which were cut from 9.91p to 7.5p for the year to January 31
1993 and were last raised five years ago.

The document will show that Christie & Co, the property surveyor, has
revalued the hotels upwards by Pounds 355m to Pounds 3.35bn, just over
10 per cent above the last estimate in January 1994 and representing
net asset value per share of 325p. This excludes the stake in the Savoy
Group, which Forte plans to sell.

The revaluation was dismissed by Granada, which said if the increase
had been added to assets on July 31 last year, the return on assets
would have fallen from 7.4 to 6.5 per cent. 'Frankly, this looks like a
bit of an own goal by Forte,' said Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada chief
executive.

Forte paid Pounds 280m to acquire the Meridien chain of 58 hotels from
Air France just over a year ago in order to give it a bigger
international presence. Of the 26 new projects under consideration, one
is in Manchester and all the others abroad, including Beirut and
Bangkok.

Most will be management contracts, although equity stakes have not been
ruled out. Expansion in the US remains a priority.

Sir Rocco Forte, chairman, said the main thrust for Meridien would be
overseas. The first year had been spent in integrating the business,
and Pounds 14m had been taken from head office costs.

'We have only just started,' he said. 'Now we will be much more
pro-active.'

Today's document will concentrate almost entirely on the hotels, giving
details of performance. Meridien is expected to have contributed 20 per
cent to group operating profits.

Operating profits from Forte's Exclusive hotels - including the Georges
V in Paris and the Grosvenor House in London - are expected to account
for 10 per cent of hotel profits, with other London hotels accounting
for 25 per cent. The Posthouse (including Crest) and Heritage
traditional hotels are likely to show contributions of 25 per cent and
20 per cent respectively.

NEW LOOK RETAILER SOLD TO INSTITUTIONS FOR POUNDS 170M

   By TIM BURT

New Look, the privately-owned fashion retailer founded by entrepreneur
Mr Tom Singh was yesterday sold to a venture capital buy-out group for
about Pounds 170m.

Mr Singh, who started the company in 1969 with a Pounds 5,000 loan, has
agreed to sell the 323-store chain to institutional purchasers led by
BZW Private Equity and jointly underwritten by Prudential Venture
Managers.

The sale follows New Look's abortive attempt to come to the market in
October 1994, which it abandoned the day before its scheduled flotation
amid fears it would not raise the estimated Pounds 150m it was seeking.

Under the terms of yesterday's deal, New Look's shareholders -
dominated by Mr Singh and his family trusts - will initially receive
about Pounds 105m in cash and shares worth about Pounds 50m in Vallsar,
an investment vehicle set up for the transaction.

That will leave the Singhs with 25 per cent of Vallsar, which is to be
renamed New Look. BZW Private Equity has also offered a further Pounds
15m payment contingent on New Look's performance in the three years to
March 1998.

Mr Gavin Aldred, New Look's director in charge of corporate strategy,
said proceeds from the disposal would fund expansion: 'In the 12 months
to March this year, we will have opened 76 stores in the UK and 10 in
France, and we aim to continue growing at about 50 outlets a year.' He
claimed New Look - advised by J. Henry Schroder - was Britain's most
profitable specialist women's wear retailer. In the year to March last
year, pre-tax profits more than doubled from Pounds 6.01m to Pounds 15m
on sales of Pounds 141m (Pounds 83.4m).

Its rival Etam, by comparison, reported first-half losses of Pounds
3.85m in the autumn, against pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.74m.

Mr Graeme White, a director of BZW Private Equity, praised New Look's
operating performance and said the existing management would remain.

Mr White has joined an enlarged board of New Look as a non-executive
director, as has Mr Martin Clarke of Prudential Venture Managers. He
said the two backers had no timetable for an exit, but did not rule out
a fresh flotation attempt.

LONDON BRACES ITSELF FOR A REPO REVOLUTION: AN OPEN MARKET IN SALE AND
REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS FOR UK GOVERNMENT BONDS STARTS TODAY

   By RICHARD LAPPER and PHILIP GAWITH

Dealers in UK government bonds are today braced for one of the biggest
changes in the City since Big Bang 10 years ago.

The introduction of an open market in gilt repos, agreements to sell
and then repurchase government bonds, will allow all participants in
the market to borrow and lend stock, removing the monopoly over such
activity that a select number of firms have long enjoyed and bringing
the UK market into line with practices in the US and France.

The Treasury and Bank of England hope the changes will make it easier
for investors to trade gilts, increasing their attractions to overseas
investors and ultimately reducing the cost of funding government debt.
But in the longer term, the development of repos could also lead to
broader changes in the structure of the UK's short-term money markets
and in the way that the Bank of England manages liquidity.

'I'm not saying that repo is going to take off overnight but it is the
brave new world,' says Ms Una van Dorssen, director of repo marketing
at NatWest Markets.

In simple terms, a repo is an agreement to sell a security and then
repurchase it at an agreed future price and date.

One party to the deal 'borrows' money, using the security as a
collateral. The other party 'lends' the money and 'borrows' the bond,
in much the same way as a pawnbroker would take temporary possession of
valuables in return for a personal loan. But although the repo looks
like a loan, in reality it encompasses a disposal and a subsequent
acquisition, reducing credit risk in the event of default by either
party.

And in the international bond markets, repos play a more complex
economic function. Dealers frequently borrow money through repos to
fund the purchases of the same bonds, which are then committed as
collateral. Securities firms usually rely on this means to finance
their operations as they do not have access to the interbank markets
where banks lend to each other.

At the same time, dealers 'lend' money through repo agreements, in a
similar way to how they might place money on deposit with a bank,
although in this case they have the additional security of holding a
bond as collateral. At the same time, the 'borrowed' bonds can be used
to meet short-term trading needs. In the bond markets, dealers
frequently take short positions (sell bonds they do not own), when they
feel prices are likely to fall.

In the UK, the ability to carry out repos or to borrow or lend
government stock through stock lending agreements has been restricted
by law to stock exchange money brokers - effectively middlemen. In
addition, only gilt-edged market-makers, a group of more than 20
securities firms licensed by the Bank of England, have been allowed to
'short' the market.

The new, more liberal rules will make it possible for a much wider
range of traders and investors to operate in the UK gilts market. 'The
fact that it is now seen as a clear and open market will make it
attractive. It will encourage people into the marketplace. They no
longer see it as an esoteric market with rules of its own,' says Mr
David Brayshaw, managing director LM Money Brokers.

Ms van Dorssen at NatWest Markets says that with a deep and liquid
underlying market and a robust futures market in place, repo's
development will increase the range of strategies open to traders.

The impact of repo on the UK's money markets should also be
significant. 'It will be beneficial for the money market and should
help to restore liquidity,' says Mr Brayshaw. 'There has been a lack of
short-dated government paper that can be traded. Also, the overnight
market, which determines funding costs, has come to be dominated by a
small group of players.'

Ms Van Dorssen says cash managers will be able to place larger amounts
of money on 'a repo line' than on an 'unsecured deposit line'.

And in the short-term, at least until liquidity in the market picks up,
dealers expect repo rates to be close to the London interbank rates,
offering investors the double advantage of security and extra yield.

Nevertheless, traditional market participants may take time to adapt to
the new environment.

Some UK institutions, which currently earn a fee by lending stock on
their books to money brokers, may have to modify their systems and
learn new skills. Specialists in managing medium and long-term
investments, they may be less prepared for the demands of short-term
money market management necessary in the repo market. And dealers may
prefer to obtain finance through existing relationships with money
brokers.

In the long-term, however, dealing directly with other dealers and
investors through repos should become cheaper and more attractive. Mr
Simon Briscoe, chief UK economist at Nikko Europe, says money market
operators will respond to repo similarly to way in which British
motorists responded to the opening of the motorways in the early 1960s.

'It wasn't an immediate transition. Even though motorways allowed for
more traffic and bigger lorries people still use the A roads.' Step
away from tradition, Page 22

DISNEY AIMS TO PUMP UP THE VOLUME

   By ALICE RAWSTHORN

Walt Disney, the US entertainment group which recently bid Dollars 19bn
(Pounds 12.2bn) for the Capital Cities/ABC television company, plans to
strengthen its presence in the music business.

It is believed to have joined forces in the autumn with PolyGram, the
world's largest record company, in an attempt to sign up Janet Jackson,
the US singer. Mr Michael Eisner, group chairman, wanted to sign her in
the hope that a high-profile star would raise Disney's stature in the
music market and attract other acts.

Under the terms of Disney's agreement with PolyGram, Ms Jackson would
have split her recording contract between the two groups. She would
have signed to Disney in North America and to A&M, the PolyGram
subsidiary which was her original record label, for the rest of the
world.

It now looks as though Janet Jackson will sign a new contract with
Virgin Music, the record label to which she has been contracted since
1991 when her A&M deal ended. Virgin, owned by Thorn EMI, the UK
leisure group, is thought to have out-bid Disney and PolyGram just
before Christmas, although it has not yet signed a contract with Ms
Jackson.

Mr Eisner is still keen for Disney to expand in the music market, which
is one of the fastest growing and most profitable areas of the
entertainment industry. Until now the focus of the group's music
interests has been its Hollywood Records subsidiary founded six years
ago.

Hollywood's performance has been erratic. It has released a number of
highly successful soundtrack albums under the Walt Disney record label.
The Lion King, the soundtrack to the 1994 animated hit, has sold more
than 9m copies in the US. But it has failed to become a force in the
marketplace.

One option for Disney would be to continue to try to attract
high-profile stars. This could be slow and expensive as there is fierce
competition among rival labels for best-selling acts. An alternative
would be to bid for EMI Music, the Thorn EMI division that owns Virgin,
which is expected to be demerged from the rest of the Thorn EMI group
next autumn. But Disney could face fierce competition from other North
American companies.

MEDIOBANCA TO GIVE FERFIN OFFER TERMS: NEWS DIGEST


Mediobanca, the powerful Milan merchant bank, is expected to reveal
shortly the terms of its public offer to buy 158m shares of Ferruzzi
Finanziaria (Ferfin), the holding company that controls the Montedison
industrial group.

The move has been forced upon Mediobanca after it lost two judicial
appeals against a public offer for an amount of shares equal to those
acquired in an October raid to gain control of Ferfin. The completion
of the offer will mean Mediobanca will hold 15.26 per cent of Ferfin,
with an estimated disbursement of L582bn (Dollars 367m).

Mediobanca finally accepted the ruling of Consob, the stock exchange
watch dog, late last Friday. It had initially lodged an appeal with the
regional administrative court of Lazio, and when that failed with the
higher court of the state council.

Pricing of the offer presents several problems. Principal among these
has been the L953bn Ferfin rights issue in mid-December. This came well
after Consob's first ruling that Mediobanca must make a public offer.
Before the rights issue, analysts suggested L1,580 per share
represented the average price paid by Mediobanca in its October raid on
Ferfin.

But just before the rights issue they were suspended at L1,056; and
Consob announced only shareholders on the register before the issue
could be the subject of Mediobanca's public buy offer. This point is
apparently being questioned by Mediobanca's lawyers.

Analysts also pointed out that by being obliged to acquire 15 per cent
of Ferfin, the outlay represented over 10 per cent of Mediobanca's
assets, a large exposure.

Health groups abandon merger

After a busy year of consolidation, the US healthcare industry ended
1995 on a sour note with the formal dissolution of a Dollars 1.6bn
merger that would have created the country's largest managed care
organisation.

WellPoint and Health Systems International, two Californian healthcare
groups, abandoned a merger agreement reached last April. Friday's
development came two weeks after the two organisations announced they
were in discussions to break off merger talks, and follows indications
that executives from each side were unable to reach agreement on how to
share power in the new company.

The merger would have created a West Coast giant with the financial
muscle to acquire other managed care groups around the country. The two
had listed the ability to grow beyond their Californian base as a key
reason for the combination.

Under the terms of the all-stock deal, shareholders in Health Systems
would have received 45 per cent of the shares in the combined group.
However, the two sides are believed to have been unable to agree on
what role the smaller company's managers should play after a merger.
The deal would have provided the springboard for a far more widely-held
public company than either is at present.

Richard Waters in New York

Maculan, the troubled Austrian construction group, said creditor banks
had agreed an extensive financing package to salvage the company in its
entirety.

The financing measures include cash-credit lines worth Sch910m (Dollars
90m) which will be divided between the group's Austrian and German
creditor banks according to the previous volume of credit granted. In
addition, the creditor banks and credit insurers will make guarantee
lines available, totalling Sch770m, Maculan said.

Maculan Holding in turn has undertaken to forgo the repayment of
shareholder loans made to its operating subsidiaries with a total
volume of some Sch938m. Reuter, Vienna

Tabacalera, the partly-privatised Spanish tobacco company, has sold its
lossmaking dairy subsidiary La Lactaria Espanol SA (Lesa) for Pta4bn
(Dollars 33m).

Tabacalera acquired Lesa, Spain's biggest milk company with 10 per cent
of the market, in 1988. The buyers, the milk companies Leyma and
Iparlat, will also assume Pta5bn of Lesa bank debt, guaranteed by
Tabacalera. The state's Official Credit Institute is providing the
buyers with an Pta8bn loan to pay Lesa's debts and restructure the
company. Reuter, Madrid

VICTORS AND VICTIMS OF BOARDROOM UPHEAVAL: TIM BURT LOOKS AT THE HIGH
NUMBER OF COMPANIES STARTING THE YEAR WITH A CHANGE OF LEADERSHIP


An unprecedented number of Britain's leading companies are beginning
1996 with newly-installed chairmen and chief executives following a
year of boardroom upheaval.

Groups such as BAT Industries and Inchcape have new chairmen, while
British Telecommunications, BTR, BOC, WH Smith, and electronic
components manufacturer Bowthorpe are among those to bring in new chief
executives.

Their arrival - mostly part of a smooth succession - comes after a year
in which other high-profile directors became boardroom casualties,
including Lord Young and Mr James Ross, chairman and chief executive
respectively of Cable & Wireless.

Mr Tiny Rowland left Lonrho after losing his long-running battle with
Mr Dieter Bock, the trading group's chief executive. Other departures
included Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential; Mr Richard
Reynolds, a director of GEC; Mr Howard Robinson, chief executive at
Calor Group; and Sir Brian Wolfson, chairman of Wembley.

Russell Reynolds, the UK's largest headhunter in revenue terms, said
the number of arrivals and departures reflected the growing influence
of institutional shareholders and non-executive directors in bringing
in new management.

'We're seeing a trend that when companies are having a very difficult
time the executives are being brought to account,' said Mr David
Shellard, managing director.

He cited the Cadbury committee on corporate governance as one factor
behind the increased turnover among company directors, while adding
that the Greenbury committee on executive remuneration had focused
shareholder attention on performance-related pay.

Heidrick & Struggles International, the London-based executive
recruitment agency, said the rash of outside appointments also
signalled a growing skills shortage at board level. Mr John Viney,
chairman, said: 'There are simply too few people to go round. So we're
seeing the best, such as Sir Colin Marshall, taking on two or three
roles.'

Sir Colin, chairman of British Airways, yesterday became non-executive
chairman of Inchcape, the international marketing and services group.

'Inchcape has not been in the best of health,' Mr Viney added. 'They
know it's much better to have a top-class person - even if only for one
day a week - than someone less effective,'

Among the other new arrivals this month, Lord Cairns, who last year
resigned as chief executive of SG Warburg, the investment bank, becomes
chairman of BAT Industries.

Mr Ian Strachan succeeds Mr Alan Jackson as chief executive of BTR. Sir
Peter Bonfield, knighted in the New Year honours, moves from computer
group ICL to be chief executive of BT. Mr Bill Cockburn has become
chief executive at WH Smith.

Mr Tim Parker is taking over as chief executive at CJ Clark, the
shoemakers. Mr Nicholas Brookes is the new chief executive at
Bowthorpe. And BOC, the industrial gases group, will mark its annual
meeting later this month with the appointment of Mr David John and Mr
Danny Rosenkranz as new chairman and chief executive respectively.

NATIONWIDE LOOKS TO LIFE OPERATION

   By ALISON SMITH, Investment Correspondent

Nationwide, the UK's second largest building society, is looking to its
new life assurance and unit trust subsidiaries, which open today, to
enable it to reduce its dependence on mortgage-related financial
services.

The new operations replace the relationship in life assurance that
Nationwide has had with Guardian since the beginning of 1990s.

Mr Tom Boardman, managing director of the two new subsidiaries, said
that whereas in selling Guardian's financial services about four-fifths
of Nationwide's business was mortgage-related, he hoped that within a
couple of years this could be reduced to about half.

This strategy seems to acknowledge that endowment mortgages are
becoming less popular and that any recovery in the housing market over
the next couple of years is unlikely to match the pace of the 1980s.

Nationwide has also set itself the target of winning 70,000 financial
services customers in the first year - about 1 per cent of its total 7m
customer base.

This is more ambitious than the 40,000-plus financial services
customers it is thought to have gained each year during the six-year
tie with Guardian.

The new life company will sell term assurance, a mortgage endowment
policy, a guaranteed equity bond and a personal pension plan. The unit
trust operation will sell two unit trusts - a UK growth fund and a
balanced fund which includes an element of overseas exposure.

Apart from the policies it designs itself, Nationwide Life will also
sell a permanent health insurance policy bought in from PPP, the
healthcare company.

This is a smaller and simpler range than the Guardian policies which
Nationwide has been offering, but Mr Boardman said the straightforward
nature of the products should help to keep costs down. He believed the
range was still broad enough to meet most customers' needs.

For Nationwide, as for other mortgage lenders which have set up their
own financial services businesses, a key element will be to market
these products to the entire customer base - savers as well as
borrowers.

Initially, Nationwide's salaried financial services sales force will be
made up of about 340 agents and will grow to 380 by the end of
February. Just over half of these will be branch-based, with the
remainder available to visit customers.

FRENCH BANK SEEKS SHORT-TERM FINANCE

   By ANDREW JACK in Paris

   PARIS


Credit Foncier de France, the specialist French property bank, is
considering obtaining a substantial short-term bridging loan while it
undertakes a wide-ranging restructuring plan.

Bank executives are believed to be discussing the idea of seeking a
loan from a commercial bank, secured on its assets, which would last
about three years.

Separately, they are holding talks with the government about short-term
ways to stave off the growing financial crisis triggered by the
withdrawal of its monopoly rights over certain state-backed housing
loan schemes.

The idea is to provide the bank with time to introduce a restructuring
programme which could reduce costs by 30 to 40 per cent in as little as
the next two years, including job cuts and the possible sale of some of
its central Paris offices.

However, executives want to reduce staffing without any redundancies so
they are likely to extend the length of their programme to at least
three years.

They are also discussing refocusing the bank, possibly by withdrawing
from activities such as loans to property developers and local
authorities, and concentrating on core activities of loans to low and
middle-income housing projects.

Credit Foncier's ability to raise funds on the capital markets has been
tightly restricted recently because its share price has dropped sharply
and its credit rating has fallen.

It was dealt a severe blow during December when the French stock market
regulators recommended against it proceeding with a proposed merger
with its 55 per cent-owned subsidiary, Societe des Immeubles de France.

The deal would have provided a much-needed FFr1bn (Dollars 204m) boost
to its balance sheet. It is now looking at other ways of achieving a
recapitalisation.

The bank is also likely to discuss with the French government, in the
medium-term, a change to its legal statutes to make it more like its
private sector competitors.

Although it is a quoted company without any state shareholding, the
government appoints its chairman or 'governor'.

HYUNDAI TO ACCELERATE DECENTRALISATION: SOUTH KOREA'S BIGGEST

Mr Chung Mong-koo, Hyundai's new chairman, is likely to preside over
the gradual break-up of the giant family-owned South Korean industrial
group his father established in 1947.

That, however, is the way Mr Chung Ju-yung, the Hyundai founder, wants
it. In an attempt to avoid a family fight over the Hyundai empire after
his death, Mr Chung decided several years ago to divide it among
several of his sons and nephews by transferring his stock in most of
Hyundai's 45 companies to them.

The result has been the creation of smaller and decentralised groups
within Hyundai that amount to a confederation of allied companies.

The process is expected to accelerate with the recent formal transfer
of management control from the elder Mr Chung and his brother Chung
Se-yung, who succeeded him as chairman in 1987, to their sons.

Hyundai's restructuring, which is expected to benefit the group, could
serve as an example to Korea's other conglomerates, or chaebol. The
chaebol have been widely criticised for being too big and inefficient
while fierce competition, for example, has led to duplication of
activity.

Government officials have long urged them to abandon many of their
marginal businesses and concentrate on a few specialised industrial
sectors to improve their global competitiveness.

Splitting Hyundai into smaller groups is expected to help achieve these
goals. Each mini-Hyundai group focuses on only a few industries, and
these units are less able to support unprofitable activities than they
were within the old monolithic structure.

Under a reorganisation plan announced a year ago, Hyundai was divided
into six main groups, with almost all now controlled by one of Mr
Chung's sons and nephews.

The most ambitious of the new sub-groups is the one controlled by Mr
Chung Mong-koo, the new Hyundai chairman and eldest surviving son of
the Hyundai founder.

In 1977, he established Hyundai Precision & Industry as a cargo
container company, which became the world's largest. Hyundai Precision
now produces railway engines and carriages, sports and utility
vehicles, and military equipment. It also plans to enter the aerospace
sector, assembling aircraft and satellites.

Mong-koo also controls Hyundai's small steel operations, which he wants
to expand by building a large mill that would supply steel to Hyundai's
car and shipbuilding operations.

Mr Chung Mong-hun, his brother and the new Hyundai vice-chairman, has
developed Hyundai Electronics into one of the world's biggest producers
of computer memory chips in less than a decade. Another brother, Mr
Chung Mong-jun, controls Hyundai's shipbuilding operations, the biggest
in Korea.

Hyundai Motors, Korea's largest car company and considered the group's
crown jewel, is being taken over by the family of Mr Chung Se-yung, the
brother of the Hyundai founder. His only son, Mong-kyu, has been
appointed as the car company's new chairman at the age of 33.

Mr Chung Mong-hyuk, another nephew of the Hyundai founder, has been
named new president of Hyundai's petrochemical and oil refining
companies, another growth area.

Other main Hyundai companies, including its trading house and
construction company, remain under the control of the group founder.

A formal break-up of Hyundai is likely to take some time since the
group is held together by a complex web of cross-holdings. These ties,
however, should weaken as the government imposes limits on
cross-holding arrangements in attempt to reduce the economic dominance
of the chaebol.

Family solidarity is also expected to prevent an early break-up of
Hyundai. The Hyundai companies are likely to operate on the same basis
that Mr Chung Ju-yung has established with several of his brothers, who
have created their own small industrial groups that partly depend on
Hyundai for business.

Hyundai Motors, for example, is the biggest customer for the motor
vehicle parts company of the Halla group, founded by Mr Chung In-yung.

Nonetheless, internal conflict may also increase as rivalry grows
between the Hyundai companies. Hyundai Precision, for example, is
challenging Hyundai Motors by producing four-wheel drive vehicles and
mini-vans.

A looser organisational structure may also make it more difficult to
push through large projects that were once easily tackled under the
autocratic management style of the Hyundai founder.

Analysts will also be watching closely to see whether the new Hyundai
chairman can gain group support for his projected Dollars 10bn steel
mill, which has been criticised by some Hyundai subsidiaries as
unnecessary.

NETSCAPE LEADS THE FASHION FOR US NEW ISSUES: FT WRITERS LOOK AT THE
BEST PERFORMING SHARES AROUND THE WORLD IN 1995


New issues - if you could lay your hands on them - were the hottest
performing stocks in the US last year, with Netscape Communications,
the Internet company, racing to the fore, writes our New York staff.

The market for initial public offerings was more active than it had
ever been, but the few sceptics that remained claimed this was a sure
indication the US market was way out in front of most traditional
valuations measures.

Netscape, which produces a browser for the Internet, was floated in
August at Dollars 28 a share, and by year-end it was trading at Dollars
139, having reached a peak in early December of Dollars 174.

Other strongly performing new issues included Pixar, which handled the
animation for Disney's latest hit film Toy Story. It floated at Dollars
22 just after the film's opening at Thanksgiving, and quickly reached a
high of Dollars 49 1/2, although by year-end it had fallen back to
around Dollars 28 7/8.

Many of the new issues were in the technology sector, which had led the
market higher for much of the year, although towards the end of the
year many of these stocks faltered as growth in semiconductor sales
slowed.

The technology sector's performance should not obscure notable gains in
other sectors. Lower interest rates and hopes for productivity gains
made bank and insurance company shares among the best performers.
Banks, deep into a round of mergers, recorded gains of more than 50 per
cent.

Steel companies, most of which crawled back into profit only in 1994,
managed the dubious distinction of forming the worst-performing stock
market sector.

Another poor performer was the retail sector, which ended another
difficult year with a disappointing Christmas.

Construction falls

Building sites abound in German cities and cranes cover the Frankfurt
skyline, but construction shares headed remorselessly downwards in
1995, writes Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt. The sector's share performance
slumped by 33 per cent and 1996 is not expected to show much, if any,
improvement.

By contrast, the electrical and electronics sector had a strong year,
adding 34 per cent. Apart from Siemens, reaping the benefits of its
aggressively profit-oriented restructuring, the sector contains SAP,
the fast-growing producer of business software. SAP's share performance
has been meteoric in the past two years, though it has slowed recently.

Commerzbank, whose own new headquarters is taking shape in Frankfurt,
estimates that profits of quoted construction companies will rise a
mere 2 per cent in 1996 after 6 per cent in 1995. The German commercial
and homes building boom is now over, with public sector construction
also held back by budget constraints.

Mr Ingo Mainert, a Commerzbank analyst, says stocks likely to perform
in line with or better than the overall market this year include
motors, steel, electricals and electronics, and insurance.

The bank foresees the DAX index rising to 2,500 or even 2,600 points
after it closed on Friday at 2,254, a rise of 7 per cent on the year. A
year ago, the bank had hoped for 2,400 but the weak dollar and higher
than expected pay rises threw out its calculations.

For electrical and electronics companies, Commerzbank expects an
overall profits rise of 21 per cent this year after 22 per cent in
1995. Earnings in the steel, engineering, motor and metal industries
should show steeper rises, it says. Further markets will be covered
over the following days.

THOMAS LOCKER'S BID FOR PENTRE ATTACKED

   By TIM BURT

The largest shareholder in Thomas Locker yesterday claimed the
engineering group was seeking a reverse takeover with its proposed
Pounds 7.5m bid for Pentre, the industrial drums manufacturer.

Mr John Carr, who holds 22.6 per cent of Thomas Locker's ordinary
shares, said the purchase price overvalued Pentre: 'The shareholders of
Thomas Locker not only get no premium for the very significant value
inherent in the company they own, they are being asked to approve a
scheme that will lose them control.'

Mr Carr, who acquired his stake in the company last May, urged
shareholders to reject the acquisition, which is being funded by the
issue of 8.62m new and 25.9m A ordinary shares. He also condemned as
inadequate a proposed 3-for-10 scrip issue of additional ordinary
shares, designed to compensate ordinary shareholders for the loss of
voting rights.

The dissident shareholder, advised by KPMG, said there was no logic for
Thomas Locker in acquiring Pentre, which he claimed was burdened with
Pounds 6.9m borrowings.

Neither company was available for comment.

MARKETS:
ANXIOUS EYES FOCUS ON COPPER


London Metal Exchange dealers returning from their festive break today
will be anxious to ascertain the new year mood of the copper market,
which is likely to set the tone for other base metals contracts as
well.

Last week's lightly-traded inter-holiday period ended with the copper
market close to its 1995 low as stocks soared towards the excessive
level at which they ended 1994. At 296,425 tonnes they were more than
double the July low.

With further rises in stocks expected, analysts and traders were
predicting further falls this week. '(Stop loss selling orders) were
triggered below Dollars 2,665 earlier today,' one trader told the
Reuters news agency on Friday afternoon, 'and more are likely to be
lurking below Dollars 2,650. . . copper is back on shaky ground.'
Several analysts forecast that copper would drop to Dollars 2,500 in
the medium term as new production capacity came on stream and stocks
continued to accumulate.

The steady increase in stocks over recent weeks has been encouraged by
big premiums available for immediate delivery at the LME. As the stocks
have risen these premiums - known as 'backwardations' - have narrowed.
'If stocks keep rising, and we do expect they will, then the spreads
should come in even more,' Adam Rowley of Macquarie Equities told
Reuters.

'At some stage in the first quarter of 1996 we are looking for quite a
sharp fall in copper prices,' he added.

'With February/March at Dollars 80 to Dollars 90 backwardation it looks
as if this period will stay tight,' said Wolfgang Becker of Iceni
Commodities Brokerage. 'Obviously at some stage the whole thing will be
reversed, but this sort of stock rise may be a bear trap.'

Options traders told Reuters prices could overshoot downside targets if
hedging against large put (selling) positions below the market gathered
pace. 'We are just waiting for copper's resilience to end and when it
does the market could collapse,' one said.

ASSESSING THE POWER OF MULTINATIONALS: GLOBAL INVESTOR / TONY JACKSON
IN NEW YORK


A noisy debate has broken out in that quiet retreat for the weekend
reader, the book review section of the New York Times. It revives an
issue which some might have thought buried: the power of the
multinationals. It is also a useful reminder that the triumph of free
trade - an idea implicit in most investment strategies today - cannot
be taken for granted.

The opening salvo came in a review by the political theorist Mr Francis
Fukuyama of a book called Opposing The System. The book, by a veteran
leftist Mr Charles Reich, reportedly argues that the current social
malaise - poverty, unemployment and so forth - has been engineered by
large corporations for their own benefit. Therefore, it says, the
powers of government should be increased to control them.

Mr Fukuyama regarded this as 1960s claptrap. The remedies proposed by
Mr Reich, he argued, had got us into this mess in the first place.
Poverty and crime were caused not by big companies, but by big
government.

Enter stage left another 1960s veteran, the consumers' champion Mr
Ralph Nader. Big corporations, he wrote in reply, erode democracy,
export jobs, and weaken the legal safeguards for workers, consumers and
the environment. 'Until Mr Fukuyama understands that a society rots
from the head down and that corporate power needs analysis, he will
never understand Mr Reich's thesis,' he concluded.

So far, so familiar. But the role of the multinationals is becoming
part of a wider issue: that of free trade. If you believe that free
trade is destroying jobs and damaging society, you are bound to blame
the multinationals as its agents.

As another book recently put it, global free trade 'will impoverish and
destabilise the industrialised world, while at the same time cruelly
ravaging the third world.' The author is no 1960s leftist, but the
erstwhile corporate raider Sir James Goldsmith.

As a blend of right-wing populist and born-again environmentalist, Sir
James forms an unlikely bridge between the two wings of protectionism.
On the right, he is joined by the US presidential candidate Mr Pat
Buchanan and by the fellow-billionaire Mr Ross Perot.

On the left, he links with those who argue that free trade enables bad
environmental practice to drive out good: that through the agency -
again - of the multinationals, production will gravitate to countries
free from costly environmental controls.

Those who feel paranoid about the unholy alliance of free-trade
governments and big business can point to one central fact. As the
chart reminds us, world trade has indeed been growing rapidly in
relation to the world economy since the late 1980s, having previously
grown in line.

But are corporations growing in proportion? The evidence is mixed. Last
year, the three biggest US companies by revenues, as listed by Fortune
magazine, were General Motors, Ford and Exxon. Their combined sales of
Dollars 384bn (Pounds 249.3bn) were equal to 5.7 per cent of US GDP.
The figure for the same trio 20 years before was 6.7 per cent.

But if US multinationals are not bigger, they may still be more
powerful. Arguably, modern communications and the lowering of trade
barriers give them much more opportunity to arbitrage labour and
capital around the world. Hence the solution of such as Mr Buchanan:
put the barriers up again.

It might be thought that the impulse to free trade is politically
unstoppable: and indeed, that in the coming world of the Internet the
genie cannot be put back in the bottle anyway.

Not everyone in the investment community agrees. The highly successful
investor Mr George Soros, for instance, argues that electronic trade is
not intrinsically different from the old kind, just faster. It would be
perfectly feasible to re-impose exchange controls, he says. Single
countries could not do it, but groups of countries could.

Mr Soros is gloomily convinced that the present world order, which he
regards as a golden age of capitalism, will ultimately break down. The
last comparable period, he says, was the end of the 19th century. In
those days, 'the British Empire was at the heart of the system, and had
an interest in maintaining security. When there was trouble, it sent a
gunboat. Now there is no chief beneficiary (from stability): certainly
not the US.'

Should the average investor worry about all this? Not for the time
being, perhaps. Both of the likely protagonists in next year's US
presidential elections, Mr Clinton and Mr Robert Dole, are professed
free traders: although both will bear watching for signs of concessions
to their respective outer wings.

The point is rather that the case for a prolonged global bull market
contains an internal contradiction. On the one hand, we are told that
multinational corporations are enjoying a one-off shift to greater
productivity and cheaper labour, based largely on the globalisation of
markets. On the other, we are told the globalising process does not
entail empoverishing one set of workers to the benefit of another. Free
trade means faster growth, so the pie gets bigger.

This worked very well for small countries like Taiwan and Korea, which
were able to develop and open up at their own pace. It is another
matter, to paraphrase Sir James Goldsmith, when political upheaval,
modern communications and the liberalisation of capital movements hurl
4bn workers into the world economy in the space of a few years.

Hence the internal contradiction. Proponents of the bull market argue
that the shift in power between capital and labour is profound enough
to last for a generation. The question is what that generation will
make of it. If it feels disposed to rebel, global free trade could be
the first casualty.

TIME TO REWRITE INFLATION TARGET: ECONOMICS NOTEBOOK / ROBERT CHOTE


Over the last five years many countries have adopted formal targets for
inflation as the centrepiece of their economic policies. But turning a
vaguely expressed enthusiasm for low inflation into a precise numerical
objective is not as straightforward as it sounds.

For one thing, policymakers face a trade-off between the need to
establish credibility and to demonstrate humility. Any target has to be
demanding enough to persuade people that the authorities are serious
about achieving low inflation; but it cannot be too demanding because
credibility will then be lost again when the target proves impossible
to hit.

In 1992 Britain adopted a formal inflation target comprising three
objectives: underlying inflation between 1 and 4 per cent until spring
1997; between 1 and 2.5 per cent in spring 1997; and below 2 per cent
in the long term. The most demanding element soon slipped from public
consciousness, but the first two stayed in place. By last summer,
however, the remaining target had to be updated. Interest rate changes
take about two years to affect prices, so it was becoming too late to
do much about inflation within the target period.

Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, announced therefore in his Mansion
House speech that he would aim for underlying inflation of 2.5 per cent
or less beyond spring 1997. He predicted this would keep inflation
between 1 and 4 per cent most of the time, recognising that unexpected
events might push inflation higher when it was too late for
policymakers to react.

This formulation has caused confusion ever since and influential voices
have argued that it needs rewriting again. Sir Terry Burns, the
permanent secretary to the Treasury, said shortly before Christmas that
the government should move away from targeting a range for inflation,
concentrating instead on a single figure. Some senior officials at the
Bank of England agree.

The Mansion House speech left many questions unanswered in the minds of
City and academic economists. Was the new target looser or tighter than
its predecessor? Was the inflation objective 1 to 2.5 per cent, 1 to 4
per cent or 2.5 per cent and below?

The conduct of interest rate policy in subsequent months only deepened
the mystery. Mr Eddie George had told the chancellor in May that
inflation was set to exceed 2.5 per cent in two years' time and that he
should therefore raise rates. The chancellor refused because he thought
inflation would be lower. Economists were unnerved by the disagreement,
but at least both sides appeared to agree on the definition of the
target - 2.5 per cent or below.

But in September the Bank muddied the waters. It continued to predict
that inflation would exceed 2.5 per cent in two years' time, but
dropped its demand for a rate rise. Shortly afterwards, Mr Mervyn King,
its chief economist, argued that the target would be satisfied if
inflation averaged 2.5 per cent or less over a long period. To
observers who had thought the authorities were supposed to be erring on
the side of caution - keeping inflation below 2.5 per cent except in
unavoidable circumstances - this looked like a loosening of policy.

But in a sense it was simply a recognition of the inevitable
limitations of inflation targeting. These limitations were demonstrated
by Andrew Haldane and Christopher Salmon, from the Bank, in a study
published last month*. They constructed a model of British inflation
since 1960 and reran history as though the authorities had pursued a
2.5 per cent inflation target by setting interest rates on the basis of
a forward-looking forecast.

The study suggested inflation would have been lower and less variable
had the authorities followed this policy, as the graphic illustrates.
But Haldane and Salmon also used the model to assess the possible
outcomes for inflation had the economy been buffeted by the whole range
of unforecastable outside disturbances which was typical of the period.
They concluded that even if monetary policy had always been well
directed, the authorities would have had only a one-in-four chance of
hitting a 1 to 4 per cent inflation target: 'Other things equal, these
results would argue for an inflation target band width at least as wide
as that operating in the UK - and possibly much wider.'

This study provides further evidence that it may be counter-productive
to express the inflation target as a range at all - be it 1 to 4 per
cent or 2.5 per cent and below. If the range were wide enough for even
a well-intentioned policymaker to be confident of hitting the target,
it would have to be so wide as to provide little gain in credibility.

Finland has recognised this problem and aims simply for inflation of 2
per cent. The Bank of Finland concedes that it would be impossible to
hit the target precisely in any given month, except by chance. But it
argues nonetheless that a single figure provides a better anchor for
private-sector expectations than a target range.

Mr King's comments and the Bank of England's advice this autumn suggest
that the authorities in the UK may be behaving as though they have a
point target for inflation slightly below 2.5 per cent - even though
that is not what the formal statement of the target says. If so, the
chancellor would do well to rewrite his target again so that it
reflects reality in a rather clearer way. *Targeting Inflation, Bank of
England, 1995

ZAMBIA'S STOCK MARKET


* Zambia

Zambia's stock market will struggle to trade for the foreseeable future
due to a growing crisis in the banking sector, analysts have said,
Reuter reports from Lusaka.

Several large institutions have been unable to participate in the stock
exchange because their money has been tied up in four collapsed
financial institutions.

Four banks collapsed between May and November, leaving 16 in the
country.

A Rothmans of Pall Mall Zambia public offer, which closed on December
7, for example, was grossly under subscribed because the pension
schemes and other institutions expected to have participated had their
money tied up.

* Thailand

The average daily turnover on the Bangkok stock exchange in 1995 fell
by 27.5 per cent from Bt8.6bn to Bt6.25bbn.

Foreign trading on the SET over that period was Bt804.36bn, accounting
for 26.35 per cent of total trade.

Foreign buying was worth Bt425.3bn in the period, while selling
accounted for Bt379.03bn.

* Hong Kong

The Hong Kong stock exchange will review regulations on options trading
in the first quarter of 1996 and does not expect to launch new options
during the review period.

The review would cover the proposal that market makers should be exempt
from stamp duty when they conducted arbitrage with the spot market to
spread risks.

The exchange will also study changes to rules governing opening bids
and how to increase the number of market participants, including market
makers

The exchange began listing individual stock options in September and
currently trades options on nine stocks.

* Indonesia

Further state asset sales, an updated legal framework and automation
could mean a bright start to the year for the Jakarta stock exchange,
brokers and analysts believe.

The exchange switched to a fully automated trading system from manual
operations in May, after long delays. This coincided with a move to new
premises in the central business district, and the extension of trading
by 90 minutes each session.

Brokers and analysts said the automated system had helped raise
efficiency and transparency and add liquidity. The fully automated
trading system would also provide a springboard for a planned move to
fully scripless trading, expected in the next few years.

The government is expected to list many of the more than 200 state
companies in the next few years.

* Philippines

The Manila equities market, which languished for much of last year, is
expected to rebound strongly during 1996 as more companies are listed.

The authorities expect the creation of a central depository, the start
of scripless trading and tighter rules to prevent insider trading to
boost sentiment.

Some brokers said they expected up to 30 companies to list.

However, inflationary pressures in the first quarter could be brought
about by an impending increase in domestic oil prices.

At present, about 200 companies are listed.

A central depository would begin operations for treasury bills and
government bonds in March before expanding to shares by the third
quarter of 1996.

TRADERS PIN HOPES ON DOLLAR


If foreign exchange traders have their wishes granted, 1996 will be a
year of volatile markets. Last year was much better than the dismal
spectacle of 1994, but the last few months were characterised by the US
dollar trading in a very narrow range.

There is a fair amount of bullishness among currency forecasters about
the outlook for the dollar, though in recent years it has managed to
confound the best intended explanations for why it should rally.

Analysts at Lehman Brothers think that the dollar stands to benefit in
the coming months from: perceptions that inflation has become
structurally lower, a modest improvement in the current account deficit
as a proportion of GDP, and resolution of the budget negotiations.

They caution, though, that any rally could run into the buffers in the
second half of the year, which may be dominated by a turn-round in
German interest rate expectations.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs are also bullish about the dollar,
forecasting levels of DM1.55 and Y112 in the next six months. Against
the yen, their thinking is based upon trends in the trade and current
account data of both the US and Japan, which suggest that the big
bilateral balances between the countries are turning in the dollar's
favour.

Against the D-Mark, their thinking departs from the premise that the
German economy is suffering from the mis-alignment of the D-Mark in
Europe, and this will require the Bundesbank to ease monetary policy in
order to curb D-Mark strength.

Politics will be a key variable. US presidential elections will affect
the dollar, while the progress towards monetary union in Europe will
also be an important determinant of D-Mark and Swiss franc performance.
The proximity of elections in the UK, and a possible Labour government,
could make life difficult for sterling.

LOOKING AHEAD TO BRIGHTER PROSPECTS: THE EMERGING INVESTOR / JOHN PITT


The year just ended has not been one that investors in the world's
emerging equity markets will care to remember. Far better to look ahead
to the brighter prospects that many strategists believe beckon in 1996.

But there were some winners during 1995 - a year in which what have
become known as the 'pre-emerging' markets came into their own.

Take Jordan, for example, capitalised at less than Dollars 5bn (compare
this with Mexico's market capitalisation of about Dollars 90bn), and an
annual turnover estimated at less than Dollars 1bn. (Mexico has an
average daily turnover of at least Dollars 100m.)

A far sighted investor who took a position in the country's fledgling
stock market at the start of last year would have seen
dollar-denominated assets appreciate by 23 per cent. Compare this with
a loss of 35 per cent in both India and Hungary, or 40 per cent in Sri
Lanka.

Certainly one of the prominent themes of 1995 has been the growing
interest in these pre-emerging markets: countries which are just
beginning to organise their financial structures, but are endeavouring
to do so as quickly as possible.

As the main emerging markets of Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey,
for example, retreated in the face of a flow of funds back into the
developed world, so interest turned to lesser known regions. In
particular, a race began among a number of US and European investment
banks and brokerages to establish contacts and trading positions in
Africa. It became clear that in this 'new scramble for Africa' returns
on investments could, in many cases, far exceed those in the more
mature markets. But the risk would also be much greater.

This did not deter the launch of a number of African funds during 1995,
although most were naturally skewed towards the largest market on the
continent - South Africa. With an estimated market capitalisation of
Dollars 274bn Johannesburg is the world's seventh largest stock
exchange.

Russia was another growth area and some commentators believe that 1996
will see this market come of age, especially after the presidential
election is out of the way. ING Barings global strategy unit led by
Michael Howell, for instance, believes that both eastern Europe and
Russia show attractive valuation levels, and thinks fund managers are
ready to significantly increase their exposure.

'Of the Dollars 50bn expected to flow towards emerging equity markets
in 1996, I expect some Dollars 5bn to head towards eastern Europe and
Russia,' says Mr Howell. 'This is equivalent to more than 10 per cent
of existing market capitalisation, and, perhaps, as much as 25 per cent
of the existing free-float.'

Other factors likely to lift investor sentiment in Russia include an
improvement in custodial operations, with expectations that an
independent central depository will finally be created.

Mr Mark Mobius, president of the Dollars 7bn Templeton Emerging Markets
Fund, is another enthusiast for Russia, although he is aware that the
country's turbulent political climate is likely to get worse before it
gets any better.

Nevertheless, he is confident that potential for investment is bright,
given that the country has embarked on what he calls a 'revolutionary'
approach to financial market reforms.

But what of the core emerging markets?

Mr Arnab Banerji, chief investment officer of Foreign & Colonial
Emerging Markets based in London, believes that in spite of a
disappointing return on investments in 1995 the outlook remains
positive. He picks South Korea, India, Brazil and Taiwan, among others,
as having strong prospects.

India, for example, continues to have good compound earnings growth, he
says.

He is also among a number of strategists who favour Brazil among Latin
American markets.

Garantia, a leading Brazilian investment bank, warns that slower
economic growth during the first half of the year will put a brake on
the stock market's momentum; while for the year as a whole it will be
very much a matter of selecting specific sectors. Garantia favours the
food, beverage, packaging and retail sectors, on the basis that the
recent decline in inflation means that many people now have a
disposable income for the first time in years.

At UBS the emerging markets team is keen on Chile, South Korea and
Turkey, all for different reasons. Chile will continue to see an
improvement in the economic picture and political problems are forecast
to dissipate; South Korea is expected to benefit from an easing in
monetary policy; and Turkey should be able to move forward once again
now that the parliamentary elections are out of the way.

Chile will also benefit from the increased weighting - from 1.9 per
cent to 7.3 per cent - which the equity market will attract in the
IFC's investable index which starts this month. Mr Nigel Rendell at
James Capel, who classifies Chile as 'an Asian tiger living in Latin
America', forecasts that despite the recent rise in interest rates,
corporate earnings will rise by 25 per cent in nominal terms, valuing
the market on a prospective p/e of 16 times.

Whether or not this year will see a pick-up in activity among the
world's emerging markets depends on a host of factors, not least the
movement in US interest rates. Further easing in US monetary policy,
many analysts believe, could trigger a fresh wave of institutional
money out of the US and Europe, and into Latin America and the Far
East.

INVESTORS FACE A DEARTH OF ECONOMIC DATA


Thanks to the latest Federal government shutdown, US stock market
investors start the new year facing a dearth of official economic data
against which to judge the economy's performance.

The only significant new information this week will be the National
Association of Purchasing Management report for December, due today.
The headline NAPM index for the month is expected by most economists to
be around 47.5 - higher than November's 46.5 but still below the
50-mark which would point to expectations of manufacturing growth. That
would provide a firm backdrop for the bond market, whose recent gains
have underpinned share prices.

While keeping one eye on bonds, the stock market will begin to fix its
attention on the corporate earnings season starting later this month.

Three months ago, a generally strong set of quarterly results helped
set the stage for the stock market's fourth-quarter rise. This time
around, the figures will be pored over for signs of how the US's
economic slowdown is affecting earnings growth.

Most market followers expect earnings growth to taper off during 1996.
But corporate cost-cutting and share repurchases have left plenty of
room for earnings to come in ahead of expectations. And with US
investors still buying mutual funds, there seems to be plenty of cash
around to chase share prices higher.

STRATEGY

   By MICHAEL MORGAN

The start of the new year has brought the usual crop of recommendations
from brokers. Spain and Sweden feature among the lists as potentially
good performers in 1996 while the time may now be ripe to take profits
on Switzerland after its strong run last year.

Views on Italy are divided, with some analysts thinking the time is
right to give the market another chance but others finding the
political outlook still unappealing.

JP Morgan expects equity markets to remain volatile, with positive
responses to interest rate cuts probably offset in part by continuing
bad news on earnings.

Morgan reiterates its underweighting of Paris, saying France is
expected to experience one of the slowest growth rates in Europe next
year. It is taking profits on a previous upgrade of the Swiss market
and switching the money into Italy, which it believes is discounting
the bad news and could react positively to a relaxation of monetary
policy.

Morgan says the low valuation on its forecasts and scope for interest
rate cuts makes the Swedish market look attractive after its recent
underperformance.

Lehman Brothers still recommends being overweight in the Spanish,
French, Swedish and Dutch markets. It says the first two are cheap,
relative to debt, while slower French growth has been more than
discounted by the market.

Sweden looks attractive on a prospective dividend basis, while the
Dutch market is the cheapest among the core European economies.

The UK, Swiss and Italian markets remained relatively expensive.
Liquidity flows had helped the first two, but value would come through.
In spite of its underperformance, Lehman saw little value in Italy.

ABN-Amro Hoare Govett, meanwhile, continues to prefer Germany and the
Netherlands in core Europe while Spain is its peripheral market of
choice. And while Italy's valuations have improved, ABN still does not
trust the politics.

TOKYO

With the Year of the Pig ending on a note of slight recovery, some
market participants are hoping that the Year of the Rat will be a good
one for the Japanese shares, writes Emiko Terazono. Past Years of the
Rat have seen the market rise by an average of 54.6 per cent, and the
animal is regarded by believers of traditional omens as a favourable
sign for investments.

Stocks may need all the help they can get since banks and life
insurance companies are expected to sell their share holdings ahead of
the March book-closing. Analysts point out that there has been heavy
trading around 21,500 and regard that figure as a strong resistance
level.

HONG KONG

Further gains are expected among equities this week after Friday's
year-end window dressing and solid gains in the futures market, which
took the Hang Seng index to intra-day and closing highs for 1995.

Analysts are concerned, however, that the near-term outlook for
recently active newspaper stocks remains cloudy in view of their weak
earnings prospects. They add that the decision to relax conditions
governing the pre-sale of uncompleted flats will benefit developers,
although it will not have much stimulative effect on the local property
market.

FRANKFURT

The Bundesbank meets on Thursday, but having cut key rates at its last
meeting, no action can be expected on the discount or Lombard rates
this week.

James Capel says the Bundesbank Council will wish to assess the impact
of the monetary easing on M3 and the real economy over some weeks.

The most interesting feature of the meeting was likely to be what the
council said about the repo rate.

'We would expect a fairly prompt return to a variable repo rate, which
is likely to drift lower over the coming weeks,' says Capel.

On the corporate front, analysts are expecting a let-up in the number
of new bourse listings in 1996 after last year's flood, although
November will bring the flotation of Telekom, Germany's telephone
monopoly, which is expected to raise DM15bn.

Companies raised a record DM8.5bn in new funds in 1995 from 20 IPOs,
including the listing of Merck, the drugs group, that was Germany's
largest post second world war stock offering, which raised DM2.4bn, and
the Adidas placement, which raised DM2.1bn.

DUBLIN

Even after last year's performance, which saw the Irish equity market
climb by 20 per cent to end among the best performing markets in Europe
for the third successive year, Dublin retains its enthusiasts.

Mr Robbie Kelleher at Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin says the market has
more than doubled since the trough of October 1992 but still expects
the ISEQ to be among the top performing indices in 1996.

'Valuations remain low, both by historic and international standards,
the Irish economy is likely to be the fastest growing economy in in
Europe again in 1996 and the strength of corporate cash flows and
balance sheets is likely to restrict the supply of new equity to a
minimum,' he says.

How this better relative performance translates into absolute
performance depends on developments in other markets.

Mr Kelleher believes the international equity market rally can be
sustained in the early part of 1996, on the back of continuing support
from low interest rates, low inflation and rising bond prices.

YEAR EXPECTED TO OPEN ON POSITIVE NOTE


The UK market starts what could be a general election year in a healthy
spirit. A base rate cut in December, accompanied by reductions in
European and US interest rates, creates a positive background for
equities.

With most observers expecting base rates to fall further in the early
months of 1996, shares could yet set some more all-time highs. While
the FT-SE 100 index did well in 1995, it still lagged well behind Wall
Street's phenomenal performance.

The first test of the year will be the spring results season, not so
much for the figures themselves, but for chairmen's statements about
trading conditions in early 1996. The market shrugged off some profits
warnings in late 1995, mainly on the hope that UK economic growth was
pausing for breath, rather than grinding to a halt.

As the year moves on, thoughts will inevitably turn to the date of an
election, and the chances of a Labour government.

Concern will probably focus, not on macro-economic policies, but on
micro-economic matters such as the minimum wage or dividend taxation.
If Labour maintains its strong lead in the opinion polls, shares may
start to come under pressure.

Much went right for the UK stock market in 1995 - takeover activity, a
strong Wall Street, falling bond yields and worldwide interest rates.
It will be a surprise if all those factors are still as positive in
1996.

CVRD MANDATE SUGGESTS END OF THE GOLDEN 3% FEE: INTERNATIONAL OFFERINGS


The debate about fees which investment banks charge for arranging
international equity offerings is set to be a lively one in 1996,
judging from the aggressive bids which emerged in the recent
competition to win Brazil's Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) mandate.

Shortly before Christmas, the Brazilian government said it had chosen a
consortium including Merrill Lynch, NM Rothschild, KPMG and four
Brazilian partners to handle the sale of its 51 per cent stake in CVRD,
one of the world's largest exporters of iron ore.

The winning consortium is charging a fee of 1.9 per cent to arrange
what is expected to be one of the most significant international equity
offerings of 1996. According to market valuations, the government's
stake is worth about Dollars 5bn but the sale is likely to be spread
over at least two offerings.

If the winners' fee looked low, it was by no means the lowest. Bankers
involved in the bidding said a consortium led by Lehman Brothers had
offered to do the business for a fee of 1.75 per cent and another
including CS First Boston for 1.9 per cent.

It is also believed the fee bid by the consortium including Morgan
Stanley and SBC Warburg (disqualified because the first part of its fee
estimate was too far below the average) was in this region.

By contrast, Goldman Sachs, which had come top in the technical part of
the bidding contest, had bid a fee of 3.125 per cent, bankers said.

Bankers involved in the consortium which won the CVRD mandate say the
level of the fee was justified because the sale will be a secondary
offering and not an initial public offering, which usually commands a
higher fee.

Half of the CVRD stock is already traded, making CVRD the most
widely-held stock after Telebras and Petrobras. As a result, it already
has a wide following among foreign analysts and investors.

They also point out that there is a history of low fees in Brazil,
where past international equity offerings have been done for fees of
just over 2 per cent. But the two most important reasons bankers give
to justify the fee are: first, the size of the offering; and second,
the importance of being involved in the first of many privatisations in
Brazil.

Although bankers do not expect the government to sell its CVRD holding
in one go, the arranging banks stand to earn close to Dollars 100m from
the whole process.

On the second point, the bidding highlighted the willingness among
international banks to drop their fees in order to be at the forefront
of Brazil's privatisation programme.

The government wants CVRD to pave the way for further sell-offs in the
country's electricity and telecommunications sectors over the next few
years.

The fact that three leading investment banks were willing to arrange
the CVRD sale for a fee of less than 2 per cent, despite the risks
associated with an emerging market such as Brazil, is also a reflection
of the increasingly intense competition in the international equity
market.

Once one of the most lucrative sectors of investment banking, fees for
arranging deals, particularly privatisations, have been eroding
steadily over the past two years.

This has come about as governments seek to maximise the proceeds of
selling off state assets and new players try to break into the market.

The downward pressure on fees has been mainly on privatisations, where
there is likely to be follow-on business for the banks, and less so on
corporate IPOs or secondary offerings. However, there are signs that
corporate fees are also coming under pressure.

In view of the ever-greater number of privatisations in Europe and
elsewhere in the world and the growing number of investment banks
wanting a slice of the action, it is inevitable that fee levels have
become one of the main bargaining tools.

With competition set to stiffen further, many bankers now believe the
golden 3 per cent level, once the norm for European privatisations, has
gone for good.

Antonia Sharpe

Goldman Sachs maintained its position as the leading global
co-ordinator of international equity issues in 1995, according to data
from Euromoney Bondware, Antonia Sharpe writes. Goldman's involvement
in Germany's privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, scheduled for November,
should ensure it retains the top slot in 1996. However, winning the
CVRD mandate in Brazil, which is also set to emerge in the second half
of the year, has increased Merrill Lynch's chances of taking the lead.
Although Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, SBC Warburg, CS First Boston,
Dresdner Bank-Kleinwort Benson and Lehman Brothers remain among the top
10 global co-ordinators for 1995, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, Paribas and
BNP have been displaced by UBS, ABN-Amro and BZW.

WHILE THE COUNTRY'S FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS


While the country's financial institutions' woes are likely to prompt
the Bank of Japan to maintain an accommodating stance in its money
market operations, it is expected to push up interest rates on the long
end.

Banks are expected to step up their profit-taking on bonds and stocks
ahead of the March book-closing in order to cover losses stemming from
the write-offs of bad loans.

Many of the leading banks have pledged to clear their balance sheets of
bad loans related to jusen, or housing loan companies, and some have
announced that they may fall into the red for this business year to
March.

Life insurance companies may also want to take profits on their bond
holdings due to the decline in insurance premiums. While the leading
insurers posted healthy rises in their recurring profits for the first
half to September, this was largely due profit-taking on their
investments.

The seasonal repatriation of funds from the US ahead of the March
book-closing may briefly put upward pressure on the yen on the foreign
exchanges, but this is unlikely to have a lasting impact on bond
prices.

Lehman Brothers in Tokyo estimates yields on the 10-year government
bond, which closed the last year at 2.9 per cent, to end at 3.4 per
cent at the end of the first quarter of this year.

A STEP AWAY FROM CITY TRADITION: OPEN GILT REPO TRADING

   By PHILIP GAWITH and RICHARD LAPPER

The launch today of the open gilt repo market may be something less
than a 'second Big Bang', but it does represent a further step away
from a City where custom and tradition have played an important role,
towards one governed by the more homogenised standards of a global
financial services industry.

The privileges and arcane idiosyncracies associated with such core City
institutions as gilt edge market makers (GEMMs) and stock exchange
money brokers (SEMBs) are ebbing away.

Already there is evidence of some of the more marginal GEMMs throwing
in the towel, while SEMBs will have to cope with the fact that an open
repo market comes in tandem with an open stock-lending market.

Ironically, the advent of the gilt repo market is being
enthusiastically welcomed by that other supposed City anachronism - the
discount house. These institutions have, for as long as anyone can
remember, served as the intermediaries through which the Bank of
England channels liquidity to the commercial banks.

Often the butt of ridicule for their quaint practice of having
employees don top hats every morning in order to do the rounds of the
City's main banks, they have also become increasingly marginalised in
recent years as the clearing banks have gained ascendancy in the money
markets.

More than 80 per cent of the eligible bills - those which the Bank is
prepared to discount in its daily money market operations - are held by
the clearers.

As a result, the role of discount houses over the past 10 years has
been little more than to serve as brokers on behalf of the clearing
banks.

There is a widespread belief, however, that the Bank of England will
start to use the repo as its daily medium of intervention in the money
markets (at the moment it conducts repo operations every two weeks, but
the bulk of its daily operations are done through the bill market).

This will not be immediate - the Bank will first want to see a depth of
liquidity in the repo market, both in terms of the number of
counterparties, and the volume going through - but is believed to be
inevitable.

For its part, the Bank is playing a very straight bat. It said this
week that 'it did not have plans to change the form of its money market
operations', but that the development of gilt repo trading 'could make
it sensible to contemplate change later'.

The Bank has to tread very carefully, because, in the words of one
observer, 'any change is a sea change'.

A hint that the Bank plans to start using repo alongside eligible bills
in its daily operations is sure to be taken as a signal that a move to
sole reliance on repo is likely.

Some observers believe the Bank will try to run repo and bill
operations in tandem.

There are two main reasons why such a move is considered likely. First,
there is widespread belief that intervening via the repo will be a more
effective method of managing short-dated interest rates than the
current practice of intervening, often three times a day, via the bill
market.

Second, it seems most likely to be the modus operandi of a future
single European central bank and the UK is unlikely to want to do
anything which is at odds with what it might have to do in Europe, if
it participates in monetary union.

A study last year by Mr Norbert Schnadt for the London Business School
found that the money market operations of the Banque de France,
Bundesbank and Federal Reserve differed from those of the Bank of
England in that they were conducted less frequently, utilised only
repurchase transactions, and were spread over a very wide range of
financial institutions.

It also found that even though the Bank intervened more frequently in
the money markets than the other central banks, sterling rates were
much more volatile than elsewhere.

Recently, however, UK overnight rates have been steadier. Intervention
via repo is also unlikely, in itself, to be sufficient to make
overnight rates more stable.

Any shift towards daily use of repo will be welcomed by the discount
houses, because by so doing the Bank will increase the number of active
participants in the money markets, diminishing the dominant role of the
clearers.

The introduction of an open repo market also creates a new trading
instrument which puts more emphasis on the idea of secured money - a
high priority in the aftermath of the Barings episode.

At the moment, most secured lending and borrowing is done either to the
discount market, or via SEMBs, and through them to GEMMs.

Discount houses see an opportunity in this because of their expertise
in secured lending.

Mr George Blunden, chief executive of Union plc, says: 'Discount houses
have a head start because our job has been secured money markets since
the beginning of time.' As much as 95 per cent of the discount market
is secured.

Mr Ross Jones, chief executive at Gerrard and National plc, adds: 'This
is the biggest opportunity we have had for years. We see it as a
potential new lease of life for the secured sterling money market.'

A group like Gerrards has the added advantage of having a SEMB within
the group, which will be merged with the discount house operations.
While the pivotal role of SEMBs will be diminished, stock borrowing and
lending will continue, alongside repo, so the relationships they have
will still count.

A number of the largest holders of gilts - pension funds and
institutions - have dealt exclusively with SEMBs, and early indications
are that they will be happy to continue doing business this way.

As new entrants garner market share, institutions will have to widen
their counterparties beyond the small set of SEMBs they have
traditionally dealt with, but loyalty to old relationships looks likely
to be the watchword initially.

Discount houses are also confident that if the Bank of England starts
to use the repo as an intervention mechanism, it will want a manageable
set of counterparties, dedicated to making markets in all conditions.
They believe that their chances of playing this role are good.

Another development which will encourage the development of the repo
market is the introduction of the European-wide Capital Adequacy
Directive, which also takes effect today. CAD encourages a secured
money market, because the capital requirements for repos are much lower
than for unsecured ones.

MARKETS:
THE GERMAN BOND MARKET


The German bond market market ended the year quietly but positively,
with bund futures generally expected to remain firm.

Inflation, now below 2 per cent, is clearly under control and economic
growth is modest at best. Thus the Bundesbank can sit tight after its
pre-Christmas interest rate cuts.

With the discount rate now down to 3 per cent, the chances of a further
reduction are rated as no more than slight by most economists.

It has only once fallen below 3 per cent in the last three decades -
just after the 1987 stock market crash, when it stayed at 2.5 per cent
for six months.

Mr Holger Fahrinkrug, an economist at Union Bank of Switzerland, said
the discount rate was not likely to fall so low in this cycle.

'However,' he added, 'this does not mean that monetary easing is over.'

The securities repurchase (repo) rate should fall below the current
3.75 per cent. Also, the 5 per cent Lombard rate could also be lowered,
since the bottom of previous cycles has seen it at 4 or 4.5 per cent.

If the money supply remains weak, the Bundesbank could cut interest
rates further, said Mr Bill Smyth of BHF Trust. But the 1987 discount
cut to 2.5 per cent did not produce a powerful bond rally, he noted.

MARKETS:
ALL EYES IN THE UK GOVERNMENT


All eyes in the UK government bond market this week will be on gilt
sale and repurchase agreements, or repos, which starts today.

'A whole new world of leverage trades, reverse repos, term stock loans,
buy/sells, matched books and, hopefully, very little mayhem will
transform the gilt market,' say analysts at HSBC Greenwell.

'We are entering a new evolutionary phase in the market. Repos will
impact on pricing, liquidity management, swaps, curve plays and
ultimately, we suspect, on official intervention in the money market.'

But in the near term, trading is unlikely to be heavily affected by
repos and after trading in a narrow range last week, gilts will have to
look elsewhere for life to be breathed back into the market.

The data front offers slim pickings, with M0 figures and the purchasing
managers' report for December scheduled as the only releases this week.

'M0 will be viewed with interest for what it reveals about consumer
demand in December - a month which accounts for over one-quarter of
total annual retail sales,' notes Mr Nigel Richardson of Yamaichi
International. 'The weekly notes in circulation data suggest that there
was a seasonally adjusted increase in M0 of almost 1 per cent on the
month - this would appear to confirm retailers' reports of strong sales
in December.'

INVESTORS ASSESS THEIR STRATEGY FOR 1996: GOVERNMENT BONDS

   By RICHARD LAPPER

The scale of the rally in international government bonds over the last
six months surprised the markets and left many investors scrambling to
increase their exposures.

In assessing their strategy for this year, investors must weigh up the
extent to which benign economic fundamentals, especially for the US and
European markets, are already reflected in valuations.

At the same time, the markets could be affected by a number of
political uncertainties linked to the US presidential elections and the
creation of European Monetary Union.

European bonds provided investors with some of the best returns in 1995
- with returns (in local currency terms) to December 15 ranging from
around 15.3 per cent in France and 15.5 per cent in Germany to 19.3 per
cent in Sweden.

Over the last few weeks there has been a wealth of evidence that the
growth of core economies such as Germany and France is grinding to a
halt and that inflationary pressures are continuing to ease.

Furthermore, at their Madrid summit last month European leaders and
finance ministers reaffirmed their commitment to monetary union,
suggesting the reduction of fiscal deficits will remain a priority for
governments across the continent.

'Europe is shaping up for a common currency and that suggests
governments will wrestle to bring public finances under control. These
are developments bond investors will be pleased to see,' says Mr Craig
Shute, bond analyst at Bear Stearns International in London.

Similar 'bond-positive' forces are visible in the US, where Treasuries
provided investors with total returns of more than 17 per cent in 1995.
And the current market rally has very different characteristics to that
of 1993, which gave way to a sell-off early in 1994.

During 1993, the markets were expecting further monetary tightening -
now by contrast, further cuts in interest rates are expected. The
inflation rate is falling - it was rising in 1993 - and some analysts
argue that investors have yet to fully adjust their expectations to the
extent of the downward trend in inflation.

Mr Nigel Richardson, international bond strategist at Yamaichi
International, says US inflation - as measured by the consumer price
index - has not been as low as its current level of 2.6 per cent since
1972. The present situation 'holds out the possibility that there may
be a permanent return to 1960s-style price increases,' suggests Mr
Richardson.

Yet according to the a survey of economic forecasts by Consensus
Economics Inc, investors expect US inflation to rise to 3.1 per cent in
the longer term.

'They are responding fully to the current inflation background on the
grounds that they appear to doubt it will be maintained. In essence,
therefore, the bond market has 1980s style yields against a background
of 1960s style inflation,' says Mr Richardson.

However, there are also good reasons to be cautious. For a start, the
scale of the surge in bond prices in 1995 means much of the good news
is already reflected in valuations.

Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds fell by nearly two percentage points
in 1995, touching 6 per cent by the year end, while in Germany yields
on 10-year bonds had dropped to 6.07 per cent by December 27, a fall of
more than 1.5 per cent.

'With the US and European central banks virtually moving as one to cut
interest rates before year-end, most of the good news for the bond
markets has been delivered,' says Mr Graham McDevitt, international
bond strategist at Paribas Capital Markets.

Mr McDevitt predicts an increase in volatility, arguing that there is a
high risk of a correction in the first quarter with bond yields rising
by 25 to 50 basis points. Economic slowdown could also create
difficulties by undermining fiscal deficit and debt reduction schemes,
in turn putting at risk the achievement of Maastricht criteria for
monetary union in some countries.

The impact of the slowdown will be most clearly apparent in France,
where a fall in tax revenues could impair the government's efforts to
reduce its fiscal deficit from the current level of more than 5 per
cent.

The industrial action by French railway workers last month is expected
to have reduced growth in the final quarter of 1995 to 0.1 per cent.

Finally, while leverage has been an element of the current bull market,
it is not thought to represent as serious a threat to the markets'
stability as in 1994, when highly geared trades built up in 1993 were
suddenly unwound, aggravating the extent of the sell-off.

A popular geared play last year, according to analysts at BZW
Securities, was to finance purchases of US assets with yen borrowings
on the grounds that the 'perceived potential for currency loss is small
relative to the yield pick-up.'

BZW says the leveraging has been concentrated on US more than European
bond markets and may well be limited to the short end of the Treasury
curve, though 'the impact will still have percolated along the curve.'

US TREASURIES PASSED A MILESTONE


US Treasuries passed a milestone last week. On Wednesday, the yield on
the benchmark 30-year long bond ended the day below the psychologically
significant 6 per cent level for the first time in two years. On
Thursday and Friday, it edged down further still, closing the week -
and the year - at 5.94 per cent, in marked contrast to the 7.92 per
cent at which it started the year.

The question now is whether yields will fall further still, and Wall
Street analysts believe they will. Most indicators point to a weakening
of economic growth in the coming year, further diminishing inflationary
pressures.

With recession an increasing possibility, analysts confidently expect
the Federal Reserve to continue to reduce the Fed funds rate, with the
next downward movement pencilled in for the Federal Open Market
Committee meeting of January 30-31.

This week, however, could be a quiet one in the bond market, for any
agreement between the president and Congress over a balanced budget
will almost certainly come too late to allow the flow of government
data to resume before the weekend.

Most attention is likely to focus on today's publication of the
National Association of Purchasing Managers index for December. This is
expected to show a slight increase from November's 46.5.

back last month. Figures on Italian gross domestic product are expected
to show a rise in the third quarter. US non-farm payroll data should
show a smaller rise last month than in November. A raft of German
economic figures are released this week. They should show an
acceleration in M3 money supply growth and no change in industrial
production.

SHORTS:
PUBLIC PROCUREMENT DEAL


Public sector procurement contracts worth several hundred billion
dollars a year were opened to international competition when a new
World Trade Organisation accord came into force. The 24 signatories
include the 15 members of the European Union, the US, Canada, Japan and
South Korea.

US bill on lobbying

A ban on gifts for politicians in Congress came into force. Senators
can only accept gifts worth less than Dollars 50, with exemptions for
home-state products and foodstuffs. House of Representatives members
are allowed nothing, although there are 23 exemptions including
home-state products, T-shirts and baseball caps. Lobbyists must
disclose full details of their activities.

Italy holds EU presidency

Italy assumed the six-month rotating presidency of the European Union,
with the prime task of inaugurating the Inter-Governmental Conferences
(IGCs) on the future of the EU. The presidency risks being overshadowed
by Italy's political instability and a general election.

Lamberto Dini, prime minister, has argued strongly that he should
remain in office to ensure the government is able to concentrate on the
presidency.

Britain takes over WEU

The UK took over the presidency of the Western European Union, a
10-nation defence club. Britain has pledged to take a pragmatic
approach to upgrading the WEU, with some improvements in its capacity
to anticipate and handle crises but with no question of its
compromising Nato's role as Europe's main security institution.

EU-Turkey customs union

A customs union between the European Union and Turkey came into effect
with the removal of remaining trade barriers. This followed a vote in
the European parliament in December, in which the move was approved by
343 to 149, with 36 abstentions. There had been concern about Turkey's
human rights record.

EU finance directives

The EU Investment Services Directive, and the accompanying capital
adequacy directive, were both implemented. The directives aim to give
EU investment firms a 'passport' to trade in all member states if they
are authorised in one.

The CAD also introduces European Union-wide rules for banks and
securities firms to set aside capital to cover risks in securities
trading. These are in addition to international rules covering lending
risks run by banks.

Telecoms competition

Cable TV, utility, rail and other 'alternative' networks throughout the
EU were allowed to use their infrastructure to offer telecom services.
Mobile operators were permitted to build their own networks and
directly connect to other mobile operators.

French income tax rise

An additional 0.5 per cent tax charge was introduced on all revenues in
an attempt to correct the country's accumulated social security
deficit.

German tax changes

Tax cuts and other changes took effect which should leave Germans
nearly DM20bn (Dollars 13.8bn) better off this year. Tax-free
allowances were brought into line with poverty-level incomes, more than
doubling the level of income permitted before tax to just over DM12,000
a year.

Consumers will also benefit from the elimination of the 'coal pfennig',
which was previously added to electricity bills to help pay for the use
of German coal in power stations. However, these savings - amounting to
about DM27bn this year - will be offset partly by DM7.5bn higher
contributions to pensions and insurance funds.

Deutsche Telekom tariffs

Germany's state-owned telephone company, due for partial privatisation
later this year, introduced changes to bring its tariffs more in line
with market demands. Long-distance calls will become cheaper and local
calls, which have been kept artificially cheap for decades, more
expensive. Business clients can also choose from three different
discounts of up to 24 per cent.

British alcohol tax cut

The tax on fortified wine, such as sherry and port, was reduced by 12p
for a typical 75cl bottle.

UK copyright extended

Copyright on music and literature was extended from 50 to 70 years,
implementing an EU directive of October 1993. Although virtually all
member (and non-member) states adhered to the 50-year rule, the EU
followed Germany, where royalty payments last 70 years. Britain will
now be out of step with other English-speaking countries, which will be
able to produce cheap editions 20 years earlier.

The change is retrospective, bringing back into copyright works by
artists who died between 1925 and 1945, including the composers Edward
Elgar and Gustav Holst, and writers Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of
Sherlock Holmes, Kenneth Grahame, author of Wind in the Willows, Thomas
Hardy, Rudyard Kipling, DH Lawrence, and Beatrix Potter.

Income tax back in Cuba

Cuba, which abolished personal taxes as a 'capitalist evil' after the
1959 revolution, reintroduced income tax on hard currency earnings. The
government also introduced a tax on boats - whatever their size - and
road tolls on two highways leading to tourist centres.

FINANCE:
UK GILT REPO MARKET OPENS


An open market begins in gilt repos, agreements to sell and then
repurchase government bonds. All players in the gilt market will be
allowed to borrow and lend stock, rather than only a select group of
dealers. The reform should provide greater liquidity, make the market
more attractive to foreign investors and reduce government funding
costs.

Cash for Marcos victims

About Dollars 50m (Pounds 32.4m) of money from Swiss bank accounts
belonging to the late Ferdinand Marcos, the former president of the
Philippines, is to be transferred to Hawaii. The move is part of a
Dollars 100m deal in settlement of a Dollars 2bn claim by about 10,000
victims - or their relatives - who were tortured, raped or murdered
under the Marcos regime. The Filipinos filed a lawsuit against Marcos,
who died in exile in Hawaii in 1989, after a popular revolt ousted him
from power in 1986.

AT&T targets Britain

UK phone-users can expect to find themselves the target of aggressive
campaigns by AT&T, the largest US telecoms operator. AT&T says it will
not compete on price but on quality of service and innovation. British
Telecom, which has so far brushed off challenges from its 150 or so UK
rivals, may have more to fear from the US giant.

and Russian counterparts will participate in the destruction of an
intercontinental ballistic missile silo in accordance with the
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.

Summing up in Maxwell trial

The Maxwell fraud trial resumes following a Christmas break demanded by
the jury. The judge, Lord Justice Phillips, will start his summing up.

average 2.8 per cent in western Germany. Train tickets in eastern
Germany, which used to be 20 per cent cheaper than in western Germany,

Spain. Its first activity is the takeover of 10 supermarkets in Madrid
from ALFARO. Caprabo was founded in 1959 and operates 90 supermarkets and
hypermarkets with total sales of 85 billion Pesetas and a staff of 3,500.

GRIMMA TO UPGRADE UKRAINIAN SUGAR PLANTS

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

Germany's MASCHINEN- UND ANLAGENBAU GRIMMA (MAG) said it was seeking a
DM100 million contract to modernise five sugar refineries in Ukraine.
Grimma is negotiating with various banks to arrange the necessary credits
to finance the work, but intends only to provide equipment and know-how
itself. Ukraine, like other countries in the Commonwealth of Independent
States, is struggling to revive its run-down industry and wean itself off
dependence on bartered sugar imports from Cuba.

SCOTTISH AND NEWCASTLE TAKES CONTROL OF SOUTH AFRICAN BREWER

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

One of the largest brewing groups in Britain, SCOTTISH AND NEWCASTLE, has
bought a 75% stake in niche South African beer maker MITCHELL'S BREWERY
for an undisclosed amount. Mitchell's started operations in Kynsna on
South Africa's south coast in 1983, adding further small brewing
operations in Cape Town in 1989 and Johannesburg in 1991. The company
currently produces around 1,500 hectolitres of beer a month, giving it a
domestic market share of less than 1%. The South African market is
dominated by SOUTH AFRICAN BREWERIES which has a 97 % market share.

ESTONIAN BREWER SELLS STAKE TO FINNISH GROUP

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

Estonian brewer TARTU OLLETEHAS, has agreed to sell 15% of its shares to
Finland's OLVI. The Estonian brewer said the deal would boost its exports
by means of Olvi's sales network and become the best brewer in the Baltic
states. Olvi is encroaching on a Baltic market which has so far been the
preserve of BALTIC BEVERAGE HOLDING, a joint venture between HARTWALL AND
PRIPPS RINGNES, owned by Norwegian food conglomerate ORKLA and VOLVO, of
Sweden. Olvi paid Nkr10 million for the shares. It also said it wanted to
put at least a quarter of its shares onto the burgeoning Tallinn stock
exchange. Tartu Olletehas had share capital of Nkr7.5 million and turnover
last year of Nkr175 million. The brewer is owned by MAGNUM KONSUMER, which
is also the main stakeholder in the TALLINN PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY, which
recently sold 10% of its shares to foreign investors. Both parties have
agreed that next year 25% of Tartu shares will be listed on the Tallinn
stock exchange.

Irish fruit wholesaler and distributor FYFFES Plc has sold its 50%
shareholding in the BANANA TRADING CORPORATION to a wholly-owned
subsidiary of DOLE FOOD COMPANY Inc for a total consideration of USD26.3
million. Fyffes has also entered into new long-term shipping agreements
with Dole for shipping part of its banana requirements from Latin America.
Fyffes said the shipping agreements would be of benefit to Fyffes and Dole
and would give both companies significant economies of scale. Banana
Trading Corporation owns a Guatemalan banana farming business along with
other related assets including certain banana farming assets in Honduara.

LA MODERNA TO CLINCH DEAL WITH ROYAL VAN NAMEN

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

Mexican conglomerate EMPRESAS LA MODERNA is close to a deal to buy Dutch
fresh produce distributor ROYAL VAN NAMEN. With annual sales of some USD50
million, Van Namen is one of Europe's largest produce distributors and
would add to La Moderna's growing network of distribution in the Americas.
Produce would be shipped to Europe from the Americas and vice-versa. La
Moderna grows and buys fresh produce from Chile to Canada. About 75% of
its production is currently sold in the United States and Canada. The
fragmented fresh produce market - with the largest player capturing only
7% of the market - is fertile ground for La Moderna to leverage its vast
distribution capabilities Demand in the US fresh produce market is
expected to grow more than 10% a year. A pure cigarette company just three
years ago, La Moderna has expanded into agri-biotechnology and packaging.
Its agri-biotechnology division consists of a fresh produce division and a
seeds company SEMINIS. The group's produce division exported USD250
million worth of vegetables last year. Moderna's produce company
BIONOVAJUST merged with Oakland-based DNA PLANT TECHNOLOGY to form DNAP
HOLDINGS.

Diversified Danish agri-foods group DANISCO has reported a sales turnover
figure of 16.1 billion Kroner in the 1995/96 financial year ending April

agreements with several of the big names in the international wines and
spirits trade, such as Better Brands, Selected Wines & Spirits, now known
as Allied Domecq Spirits & Wines, and Peter F. Herring. In the financial
year ending April 30, 1996, Danisco Distillers had a net turnover of Dkr

BASS CRITICISED FOR HOOPERS HOOCH CAMPAIGN

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

The advertising campaign launched by British brewer BASS to promote its
"Hoopers Hooch" low-alcohol fizzy drink has drawn criticism in
professional circles and from authorities worried about the temptation of
alcohol for young consumers. For similar reasons, Carlsberg Tetley was
recently forced to change the labelling on its "Tchickhead" brand and
Whitbread has been censured by Alcohol Concern for the implicit incitation
to violence and the anti-social behaviour that its "Lemon Jag" and
"Vanilla Heist" beers inspire amongst youngsters..

SOUTH AFRICAN BREWERIES ACQUIRES POLISH BEER MAKER

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

SOUTH AFRICAN BREWERIES, together with EURO AGRO CENTRUM, has acquired 52%
of the capital of the Polish brewery group TYSKIE in Tychy. SAB, which has
made enormous strides on overseas markets since 1993, has thus moved up
into fourth place on the world brewers' league, with a total production
capacity of 38 million hectolitres, behind ANHEUSER BUSCH (107 million
hectolitres), HEINEKEN (64 million hectolitres.) and MILLER, a subsidiary
of the US Philip Morris group (54 million hectolitres). With the Tychy
brewery, as well as the Lech brewery in Poznan, in which they already had
a controlling stake, SAB and EAC now hold 20% of the Polish beer market.
Elsewhere in Eastern Europe, SAB is now the biggest brewery group in
Hungary and is set to become Romania's number one too. In the 1995/96 year
(ending March 31), SAB turned out 24.6 million hectolitres of beer in
South Africa and 11.4 million hectolitres abroad. SAB has just made a loan
issue on the international capital market for USD300 million, in order to
raise funds to reinforce its long-term strategy.

BONGRAIN REPORTS SLIGHT RISE IN TURNOVER

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

Back home in France, Bongrain has just published its latest half-yearly
results, which show a slight increase in sales turnover to 5.055 billion
French Francs, up from FF 4.935 billion at end-June 1995. Sales were badly
affected by poor weather conditions in June, but picked up sharply in
July, which will help lift second half 1996 figures. Bongrain's turnover
also progressed at international level.

The French group's operating profits, which in the first half of 1995 had
reached FF 312.2 million, fell back to FF 250.3 million, as a result of
several different factors. For a start, manufacturers have not been able
to offset the increase in the price of milk paid to producers in relation
to its cheese-making quality by a rise in retail prices from Autumn 1995
onwards. And at the same time, by-products and surpluses have lost a lot
of their value (-20% in the case of lactoserum, for example) - something
which accounted for nearly half the drop in operating profits.

Bongrain has meanwhile continued to invest in the main brand names and in
advertising at European and international level. The group has also
managed to reinforce its presence on new markets.

Bongrain's overall profit in the first half of this year works out at FF
148.1 million (FF 184 million in the previous six-monthly period), and net
group profits at FF 129.5 million compared with 164.6 million for the
first six months of 1995.

Although no forecasts were made for the year as a whole, Bongrain is
expecting a difficult year. The company is nonetheless pressing on with
its innovation strategy, with several major launches on the cards for its
subsidiaries.

BONGRAIN FINALISES ACCORD WITH MAJOR CZECH CHEESE MAKER

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

French food group BONGRAIN, which already has a foothold in the Czech
Republic via its PRIBINA subsidiary, is busy finalising an agreement to
take over the Povltavske Mlekarny cheese-making concern, to the South East
of Prague. The Czech firm, one of the biggest in the dairy sector,
produces soft cheese and fresh cheese, as well as other dairy products. It
has an annual turnover of more than 100 million French Francs and employs
275 people. Thanks to this latest transaction, Bongrain will become sole
owner of the Hermelin soft cheese brand sold by Pribina and Pvltavske
Mlekarny.

UNILEVER OPENS FIRST SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH CENTRE IN CHINA

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

The Anglo-Dutch agri-foods and consumer products group UNILEVER opened on
October 7 its first scientific research centre in China, which is to serve
as a starting point for a successful partnership between the food industry
and academia in the country. Set up in Shanghai's Institute of organic
chemicals, the new research centre will help Unilever to draw on the
strength of the local Chinese scientific world and, at the same time,
steer the locals towards developing the most suitable technologies. The
research centre will use its scientific know-how to help match consumer
preferences with Unilever's branded products as a means of boosting sales
in China, and particularly the business of the twelve joint ventures the
Anglo-Dutch group already has in the country.

VRANKEN GROUP BUYS HEIDSIECK CHAMPAGNE FROM SEAGRAM

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

Canadian drinks group SEAGRAM announced on October 14 that it had signed a
deal to sell its famous champagne Heidsieck Monopole to Vranken. The
sell-off covers not only the brand name, but also the business premises
and stocks - some 4.5 million bottles or more than three years of sales -
and roughly 130 hectares of vineyards. Heidsieck Monopole's 70-strong
workforce will also be taken on by the Vranken group and no redundancies
are foreseen. The price tag on the transaction was not revealed, but it is
estimated in professional circles to be in excess of USD400 million.
Paul-Francois Vranken, a Belgian businessman who set foot in the Champagne
region just 20 years ago, has become, through successive acquisitions and
launches of new brands like Charles Lafitte and La Demoiselle, the fifth
biggest champagne trader, producing some 8.5 million bottles in 1995 and
with a sales turnover of more than 600 million French Francs. Until
recently, Mr Vranken was still short of a big brand name - a gap that he
will now try to fill by relaunching the Heidsieck Monopole.

To start with, he launched the Charles Lafitte and La Demoiselle brands of
champagne. Then, in 1994, he brought his company into a new phase of
external growth by taking over the Barancourt house which has a sales
turnover of more than two million bottles of champagne a year, and then
through the acquisition of Champagnes Charbaut (with sales of 1.2 million
bottles). These acquisitions enabled the Vranken group to sell more than
8.5 million bottles of champagne this year and post a turnover of nearly
FF 700 million.

Last year, Heidsieck Monopole sold 1.2 million bottles of champagne,
three-quarters if which were intended for the export market. From
Seagram's point of view, this transaction is a follow-up to the
restructuring plan its champagne branch launched last Spring.

DANISH GROUP BUYS PFIZER'S CHY-MAX DAIRY CLOTTING AGENT RANGE

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

The Danish group CHR. HANSEN has strengthened its position as market
leader in the field of dairy clotting agents by acquiring from PFIZER of
the United States the CHY-MAX range, along with all patents and related
rights. A production contract has just been signed with the American
company, which will continue to manufacture the CHY-MAX range of clotting
agents at its Indiana factory in the US. Last year, the CHY-MAX product
range's worldwide turnover was nearly USUSD14 million, according to a
communique, which did not, however, reveal the price tag on the
transaction with HANSEN. CHY-MAX is a range of dairy clotting agents
produced via fermentation and used in cheese-making. Chr. Hansen already
owned a similar range of products called CHYMOGEN. The Danish company,
better known as a major supplier of food ingredients, is a subsidiary of
Chr. Hansen Holding A/S, a firm specialised in biotechnology applications
for food ingredients, anti-allergy treatment and for technological
services for agriculture. The holding company has a workforce of about
2,000 in 30 different countries, and, for the 1994/1995 financial year,
reported a turnover of 1.8 billion Danish Kroner.

DANONE TAKES CONTROLLING STAKE IN CHINESE BREWER, DONGXIBU

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

French agri-foods group DANONE has strengthened its foothold in the
rapidly-growing Chinese beer market, by taking a 60% stake in the WUHAN
DONGXIHU BEER COMPANY, the fifth biggest brewer in China. Thanks to this
acquisition, the French group has moved up to fourth place on the Chinese
beer market, according to Danone, although it did not reveal the price tag
on its latest investment. The Chinese market, which is now as big as 160
million hectolitres of beer, is still very fragmented. Dongxinu is fifth
in the league table, with a production figure of 2.9 million hectolitres
of beer a year. Situated in Wuhan, in the Hubei province (in central
China), Dongxihu holds 40% of the market in the province, which is home to
60 million people.

Last January, Danone had announced plans for a joint venture with Haomen,
the tenth biggest beer maker in China, based in the Beijing region. China
itself has the second largest market for beer in the world, behind the
United States. And the market is expanding rapidly. It is set to cross the
200 million hectolitre mark by the year 2000, making it the biggest market
in the world.

Last year, the Danone group turned out 25 million hectolitres of beer
(Kronenbourg). It is the leading brewer in France, Italy and Spain and the
second biggest in Europe. In China, Danone is also present on the market
for biscuits, fresh dairy products (Danone brand), Chinese milk-based
drinks (Wahaha) and sauces (Amoy).

AAIR: RESEARCH INTO BARRIER PROPERTIES OF RECYCLED/RE-USED PLASTICS

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

The December 1994 Directive on packaging and packaging waste sets
ambitious targets for recovery and states that recycling and re-use must
contribute an important part of recovery. Recycling of plastics can give
rise to concern about the migration of contaminants from the recycled
plastic into a packaged food. One component of a research project
currently being carried out in the United Kingdom under the EU-sponsored
Agriculture and Agro-Industry R&D programme (AAIR) is studying the
effectiveness of a virgin layer of plastic (PET) (polyethylene
terephthalate) in limiting the migration of chemicals from recycled PET,
i.e. three-layer plastic bottles (for soft drinks) were made with a buried
layer of either virgin PET or PET contaminated deliberately with
chemicals, and migration levels were measured in parts per million (ppm).

The results of research work undertaken so far show that even with a high
level of deliberate contamination of the middle layer of the 3-layer
bottles, with hightly mobile model contaminants, migration was not
detectable after the standard conditions of 10 days at 40 degrees C or 
even after 6 months at room temperature.

This has brought the research workers to the conclusion that an intact PET
layer represents an efficient functional barrier against migration from
contaminants encapsulated in a recycled PET material under normal
conditions of use for soft drinks. The results also allow the conclusion
that the 25% recycled material employed in this test could be increased to
any technically feasible percentage provided that the characteristics of
the functional barrier layer remained unchanged.

BIOTECHNOLOGY: NEW MEANS OF BOOSTING WHEAT PRODUCTION

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

The use of modern biotechnology processes is the best way of raising world
production of wheat and meeting growing demand for this staple food,
concludes a study published on October 18 by the International Centre for
the Improvement of Wheat and Maize. The Mexico-based research centre
employs scientists from some 40 different countries, including two giant
wheat and corn producer nations - the United States and France.

Thanks to biotechnology, more wheat can be harvested from the same surface
area using the same amount of water for irrigation and the same quantity
of fertilizers; it can also help keep the impact on the environment to a
minimum, pointed out Matt Reynolds, the main author of the study. Other
means of boosting production - expanding the sown surface area or wider
use of fertilizers - are not viable in the long term, argues the
scientist. "We can use biotechnology to identify the genetic
characteristics of adaptation and resistance to insects and diseases",
said Mr Reynolds, adding that the size of the grains and the taste of
wheat were equally important.

The development of a new prototype wheat crop and the idea of leaving the
ears to develop over a longer period of time are among the other solutions
suggested by the study to the problem of meeting rising world demand for
cereals. The Mexican research centre's study also recommends the use of
"hybrid" crops, which are more hardy and resistant to disease, insects and
parasites than older generations of crops, even though they are not fit
for reproduction. The authors of the study point out that a possible
stagnation of wheat yields would further aggravate the problems of poverty
and famine in the world, since wheat is "the staple food of humanity".
"While the world population is growing at a rate of 2.5% a year, wheat
yields are increasing by only 1% a year", pointed out Timothy Reeves,
Director of the International Centre for the Improvement of Wheat and
Maize.

RESEARCH PATENTS: NEW EUROPEAN PATENT SEARCH SERVICE WILL HELP AVOID
DUPLICATION

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

For the last few months, European scientists have been able to draw on a
new European patent search service called QUICK SCAN, which the European
Commission would like to promote among a wider user base. It is targeting
small and medium-sized enterprises in particular, because this new service
- one of the various support measures offered under the Community's
specific programme for the dissemination and exploitation of the results
of research and technological development activities (INNOVATION) - can
help avoid duplication of research effort and unnecessary expense on
investment.

According to the European Commission's estimates, up to ECU 25 billion is
wasted every year in the EU in duplicating research and development work
already carried out elsewhere. This problem is of particular relevance to
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which are less likely to have
access to the patent information system (a study carried out by the
European Patent Office last year showed that over 60% of European SMEs do
not have access to the system). In this context, the aim of the QUICK SCAN
activity is two-fold: it not only helps avoid duplication of research and
thus promote more efficient use of funding resources, but it can also
raise awareness of the patent information system.

The Commission has sought to keep the methodology of the new service as
simple as possible. It falls under the "Technology Validation and
Technology Transfer" action line of the INNOVATION programme and projects
are subjected to a "novelty check" by the search division of the European
Patent Office (EPO). This check compares the technical developments
proposed by the project with the existing state-of-the-art in that
particular area thus enabling a well-informed evaluation of the innovative
character of the proposal.

During the months of April and May 1996, no less than 100 project
proposals selected for the definition phase under the INNOVATION programme
were submitted for assessment. 13% of these were not suitable for scanning
by the EPO for reasons of either form or content. Following the scan, 30%
of all projects submitted were classified as being "novel". In 57% of
cases, however, the novelty of the project, or parts of it, was questioned.

In at least two cases, the QUICK SCAN search results led to a complete
redirection of the project due to the discovery of information on existing
research not known to the consortium carrying out the research project. In
a few other cases, QUICK SCAN provided valuable information on possible
competitors, pointed towards interesting prior R&D work or possible end
users of a new technology.

In the eyes of the European Commission, this first exercise has clearly
demonstrated the cost effectiveness of the QUICK SCAN activity. Generally
speaking, it estimates that the costs of the scan itself amounted to only
one-tenth of the funding that has been directly saved as a result of the
scan.

FRENCH RESEARCHERS MAP COFFEE GENOME

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

Researchers at the ORSTOM Institute in Montpellier have succeeded in
mapping the coffee genome, break-through that is expected to improve plant
selection. Launched at the beginning of the 1990s, research into the gene
structure of coffee was carried out by the Laboratory for genetic
resources and the improvement of tropical plants (LRGAPT) attached to
ORSTOM (the French Institute of scientific research for development and
cooperation) in collaboration with the Nestle research centre in Tours.

The map was drawn up through the molecular analysis of plant material
provided by researchers at the Man coffee genetics station in the Ivory
Coast, where several thousand varieties collected across Africa have been
nurtured and studied for almost thirty years. The map is of Coffea
canephora, more commonly known as the Robusta variety, which is grown in
West Africa, Brazil, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. It may, however,
also be used for other varieties, notably the more widespread Arabica.

Using molecular markers, it is possible with a genetic map to identify and
locate the genes carried by the chromosomes, enabling scientists to
identify genes of agronomic interest at an early stage of development:
disease resistance, yield, bean size, caffeine content, etc. The map will
make the selection of coffee plants more rapid and effective. It has until
now taken ten years to assess the potential of new strains. Moreover,
selection has traditionally been a very expensive process, because of the
large areas needed for trials and the array of tests to assess the quality
of a coffee variety. In the longer term, the map may be used in
genetically modifying coffee plants. LRGATP researchers will soon apply
their map in the context of a programme in Kenya to control the transfer
of a diseases resistance gene identified in Robusta to the Arabica
variety. Joint projects have also been launched in the Ivory Coast and
Costa Rica.

COSMETICS: EU COMMISSION GUARANTEES SAFETY OF RAW MATERIALS USED

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

The safety of cosmetics and their ingredients in the European Union is
subject to strict regulation. The conditions in which cosmetic products
can be marketed without posing any risk for consumers are lid down by EU
Council Directive 76/768/EEC - the so-called Cosmetics Directive - which
has been amended on several occasions, pointed out EU Consumer Policy
Commissioner Emma Bonino in response to a written question from German
Green Member of the European Parliament Hiltrud Breyer. Worried about the
"mad cow disease" scare in the United Kingdom, the MEP was asking if
cosmetics users ran any risk of infection through broken skin, and, more
particularly, if the UK still used beef derivatives as raw materials in
cosmetic and was taking the same safety precautions as in Germany and
other EU Member States.

Permanently reinforced safety standards.

In reply to the German MEP's first query, Mrs Bonino simply said that the
Commission's services had no knowledge of any study that had assessed the
risk of infection through the use of cosmetics on a cut or broken skin
surface.

As for any risks related to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), the
Commissioner recalled that Council Directive 93/35/EEC amending the
Cosmetics Directive for the sixth time, had tightened up safety standards
for cosmetic products. This Directive requires cosmetics manufacturers or
importers in the European Union to provide the national authorities, or
monitoring purposes, with an information file, giving data notably on the
qualitative and quantitative aspects of the product, as well as the
physical, chemical and microbiological specifications of both the raw
materials used and the finished product, purity criteria and conditions
for microbiological control of cosmetic products, the method of
production, and an evaluation of the safety of the end product from the
human health point of view.

As for the risks posed by BSE, the Commissioner recalled that, at the
beginning of the 1990s, the World Health Organisation and various national
and EU scientific and veterinary committees concerned by the mad cow
scare, including the EU Scientific Committee for Cosmetics, recommended
that manufacturers used only beef derivatives from countries free from
bovine spongiform encephalopathy. The European cosmetic toiletry and
perfumery association (Colipa) has made quite clear that it has
scrupulously followed the experts' recommendations.

Thus specified beef offal supplied to cosmetics producers must be
accompanied by a certificate of origin. Colipa also confirmed earlier this
year that beef cattle offal most likely to pose a risk of contamination,
such as brain, spinal cord and eyes were "not used in the manufacture of
cosmetic products in the Community".

At the EU level, legislation adopted since the early days of the BSE
epidemic has been largely of a veterinary nature. After the British
Government admitted there was a potential risk of BSE transmission to
humans last Spring, the European Commission imposed a blanket ban on UK
exports of beef, beef products and derivatives. Directive 96/239/EC of
March 27, 1996 prohibited British exports of any products originating from
cattle slaughtered in the UK intended for medical, cosmetic or
pharmaceutical use. Decision 96/362/EC of June 11, 1996 stipulates that
the UK may only allow production of such products in plants under official
veterinary control which have proved that they respect the necessary
conditions. This measure states that rules governing products from the UK
also apply to production of medicines, cosmetics etc. for the domestic
market. But with this piece of legislation, the Commission also gave the
go-ahead for a partial lifting of the embargo on gelatine and tallow. The
embargo is being relaxed gradually, insofar as strict conditions laid down
by law are respected. For its part, the United Kingdom has taken a whole
host of measures since 1988, including steps to keep specified beef offal
off the market.

Tallow is mainly used for making soaps. Among the other beef extracts that
can be used in the manufacture of cosmetic products, some, such as
gelatine, are taken from various cattle tissue (bones, skin etc.) and are
used in different types of products (shampoo, soap, hair care products).
Other derivatives are extracted from specific organs such as the placenta
or the thymus and are only used for making a very limited range of
cosmetic products. The Commission nonetheless recalled that:

- beef derivatives are not used in cosmetics in their natural state, but
first have to undergo various chemical treatments;

- in most cases, raw materials of animal origin only account for a very
small percentage of the make-up of the end cosmetic product.

Under the sixth amendment to Directive 93/35/EEC, the list of ingredients
that may be incorporated into cosmetics has to be given on the label of
the product. In the case of beef derivatives, listed in a
recently-published inventory of ingredients used in the manufacture of
cosmetics, the organ from which they are obtained will also be mentioned
if it is a clearly-defined organ such as the placenta or spleen.

BIOMEDECINE: YEW TREE YIELDS CANCER-FIGHTING PRODUCT

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

An Italian company based in Milan, Indena, has developed a new medicine
that can used to treat cancer - taxol - which is made from raw materials
derived from the yew tree. The raw materials are supplied by Bioagrico, a
company based in Beert-Pepingen in Belgium, which prunes and trims yew
trees (Taxus baccata) free of charge, recovers the leaves and branches and
packs them up for delivery to Italy where they are processed.

The yew tree, a conifer that is easily pruned, is well known in the
European countryside. It can also be deadly if just a few score or hundred
grammes are ingested. Horses and sheep are particularly at risk (they can
die only a few hours after eating just 200 grammes of yew tree leaves).
The yew tree's pine needles and berries are also highly toxic.

The basic substance used for making taxol is baccatin, a substance
extracted from yew tree pine needles and which can be used in treatments
against several different types of cancer. Some twenty years ago, it was
extracted from the bark, but this endangered the survival of the trees
themselves. The substance can also be extracted from pruning or clipping
waste. In Belgium, Bioagrico has been awarded a contract to supply yew
tree clippings up to the year 2007, unless in the meantime another, more
effective substance is found to combat cancer. Currently, Bioagrico prunes
yew trees owned by 4,200 private citizens, with each cropping bringing in
about 50 kilogrammes. In season, several teams are busy working at the
same time on private yew trees, while gardeners may also send their
cuttings to Bioagrico. The "harvest" is then dried before being dispatched
to Italy. The Belgium-based company prunes yew trees in all regions of the
country and is seeking to expand its expertise to other Member States of
the European Union.

PYRETHRINS: EU PROJECT SEEKS TO RE-CONQUER NATURAL INSECTICIDE MARKET

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

A non-food research project seeking to improve and develop cultivation of
pyrethrins (natural insecticides) in Mediterranean Europe has just
received the backing of the European Commission. Bringing together
agronomists, chemists and biologists from various Member States of the
European Union, this project is being coordinated by the French firm
Sanofi Chimie and will benefit from EU financial assistance to the tune of
ECU 1.231 million for three years. Known in Europe since antiquity, but
abandoned for the last few decades, pyrethrin growing could allow the
cultivation of up to 5,000 hectares of poor and arid soil in southern
Europe, thanks to this research project.

Australian offensive.

Natural pyrethrins were the first insecticides used by man. Known from
time immemorial, cultivation of Chrysanthemum cinerariaefoium, from which
they are extracted developed in Europe from the Middle Ages onwards and
were widely used until the appearance of the first synthetic insecticides
in the middle of the 20th century. Today, because of their total
harmlessness to man and domestic animals as well as their excellent
biodegradability, they remain the reference point as active materials in
the field of domestic use, body hygiene (anti-lice products), animal
health (for keeping insects out of livestock farm buildings) and
biological agriculture, etc... All these are fields where the consumer and
EU regulations encourage the use of "clean", rather than synthetic,
insecticides, preferably of "natural" origin.

Although use of natural pyrethrins is still significant and even
expanding, cultivation of Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium historically
deserted Europe after the Second World War, shifting to Africa on a wide
scale (notably Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania). Today, these African
cultivations are threatened either because of the political instability of
the region, or because of inadequate productivity. An important market is
thus up for grabs. Europe, for its part, although a high user of these
natural insecticides (with 20% of the world market) is at the moment
lagging behind, for it is the Australians who are taking over from the
Africans and developing vast areas of mechanised cultivation in Tasmania.

If improved varieties similar to or better than those being grown in
Australia - and adapted, as in Tasmania to intensive, mechanised
cultivation - can be developed, a whole new market could no doubt be
re-conquered by European farmers, by growing a high added value crop that
is perfectly suited to fallow land and poor and arid land too.

The research project that has just got off the ground has the following
main aims:

- to study the action of natural pyrethrins, an especially the comparative
activity of the various active principles identified in the plant, as well
as the possibilities of biological synergies;

- to implement a genetic selection process designed to obtain varieties
with maximum active principle content

- to develop an optimised cultivation technique which is economically
adapted to European farms, notably through mechanisation.

More specifically, the project involves crop improvement work (evaluation
of germ plasma in the field, study of yield factors of the leaves,
isolation of different isomers, modes and sites of action of the different
isomers among insects), techniques such as interpolating cultivation and
hybridation, diseases, crop maintenance, climatisation and field
transfers, harvesting etc. and studies into the extraction/purification
process.

FARM PRODUCT PROMOTION: COMMISSION PLEASED WITH COMPANY POLICY

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

Food product promotion campaigns sponsored or run by the European Union
have taken on much greater importance in recent years and have even
qualified to have their own unit within the European Commission in
Brussels Unveiling at the Paris food show in early October the promotion
campaign for grape juice contracted out to Sopexa (a French company for
promoting sales of farm and food products), Sergio Ventura, who runs the
Agricultural Product Promotion Unit of the Commission's
Directorate-General for Agriculture (DG VI), recalled that there had
originally been no general legal base for promotional measures financed by
the EU. However, some specific sectors had their own legal base allowing
EU-sponsored promotion campaigns for a few products like milk, textile
fibres, olive oil, etc.). Later on, the necessary legal foundations were
gradually laid to enable the use of Community funds for promoting other
products. And, from 1991 onwards, a specific division was created to
manage all the product promotion schemes. With the recent reorganisation
of DG VI's structure, the existence of the Promotion Unit has injected a
bit more coherence into this field of marketing.

Grape juice consumption boosted by 70%.

His trip to Paris gave Mr Ventura the chance to explain to Sopexa's
managers that there is still a wide variety of promotional actions,
ranging from direct actions 100% managed by the European Commission, which
puts out calls for tender via specialised public relations agencies, to
actions delegated to the Member States themselves. Even in this latter
case, the Commission is still responsible for ensuring the follow-up from
the conception stage to follow-on operations, including the choice of
agencies proposing to organise the promotional measures. And some are 100%
financed by the European Union, while other actions involve joint
participation in the costs by associations or producer groups benefiting
from the promotion campaigns.

Mr Ventura illustrated his explanation with the long-running grape juice
promotion campaign as an example. Launched in 1986 at a meagre cost of
only ECU 4.6 million to the farm budget of the European Agricultural
Guidance and Guarantee Fun (EAGGF), the campaign has helped boost sales of
grape juice in France, Germany and Spain (Belgium and Italy had originally
taken part, but have since dropped out). In the case of France (which
accounts for 50% of EU production of grape juice), for example, the EU
funds are channelled through the national interprofessional wine office
Onivins, which in turn gives Sopexa a budget of eleven million French
Francs. The advantages of promoting consumption of grape juice are of
course linked to the high costs of intervention and distillation in the
table wine sector. Grape juice is also sold on a highly competitive
market, dominated traditionally by citrus fruit juices, but it has
benefited from the strong growth of the fruit juice market worldwide.

In terms of product image, the overall impact of the advertising and
promotional actions carried out in France over the last ten years has been
quite clear: grape juice has come to be seen in the eyes of consumers as a
more modern, more original and party-type drink, according to a market
research study undertaken last year. Moreover, grape juice could count on
the support of nutritionists, just as wine could draw on the support of
the medical world for the famous "French paradox" (namely that regular,
but moderate, consumption of wine can help avoid cardio-vascular
illnesses).

The numbers show very positive results too, points out the Commission. For
instance, consumption of grape juice in France has risen by nearly 70% in
the space of ten years, with household purchases rising from 220,000
hectolitres to 374,000 hl in 1995. On a fruit juice market which, last
year, began to see a slow-down in its growth rate (+11%), sales of grape
juice continued to expand strongly, both in volume terms (+16%) and in
value (+15%). This expansion was evident in all the main regions of
France: sales progressed in the West, the South East and the Paris region,
which all had previously recorded below-average consumption of grape
juice, while the North remained well above average. And two and a half
million more homes have been converted to grape juice since 1987 - an
increase of 60% in ten years (+12% for 1995 alone).

BEER: GREEN PAPER ON EXCLUSIVE PURCHASING AGREEMENTS IMMINENT

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

Already a year late, the European Commission is expected to publish a
Green Paper on selective distribution and exclusive purchasing agreements
in the beer sector - authorised since 1967 under an exemption to Community
competition rules - but probably not until the end of this year or the
beginning of next. EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert is
considering extending until 1999 block exemption Regulations based on
Article 85.3 of the EU Treaty for beer sector agreements. The Commission
said on October 16 that the proposal was to avoid a "legal vacuum" that
may occur if the block exemptions from EU competition rules were to expire
before the consultations on the Commission's Green Paper for their
replacement had been concluded. Requested by Member of the European
Parliament David Thomas (PES, UK) to comment on consultations with beer
producers and distributors, the Commission indicated that no formal
meetings had as yet taken place.

The first derogation to the general ban on agreements laid down by the
Treaty of Rome dates back to 1967 (Regulation 1967/67). This regime was
extended for 15 years in 1983 by virtue of two separate block exemption
Regulations, one covering selective distributions (1983/83), the other
exclusive purchasing (1984/83). The latter text, general in scope,
required more specific provisions for particular sectors, including
brewing, and notably the British beer industry, where the breweries hold
beer-supply contacts with pubs owned by them. The Regulations now cover
tens of thousands of agreements by which a supplier, on the one hand,
appoints a reseller as his exclusive distributor in a given area
(Regulation 1983/83), and on the other hand, a reseller agrees to buy all
his products from one supplier only (Regulation 1984/83).

At the time of their adoption, the Commission was acting on the assumption
that exclusive purchasing contracts in this sector required a major
investment by the supplier and a long-term commitment by the seller and
therefore justified exclusive contracts. The Commission therefore decided
to make special allowances for beer-sector agreements. The maximum length
of an exclusive contract was set at five years for beer and other drinks
and from five to ten years for beer exclusively. Specific clauses covered
situations where the supplier and seller had also signed a lease for
points of sale. It was agreed that the length of the purchasing contract
could correspond to that of the lease, even if the latter was for a period
of more than ten years.

The British way of life.

Under pressure from the breweries, British MEPs have visited Brussels to
ask Mr Van Miert for an extension of the exemptions for a minimum of 15
years. An EU source said the Commissioner was not unsympathetic to the
legal uncertainty for breweries caused by the possible review of the
exemptions, and that he had also understood the "tied tenancy" pub-supply
agreements were "part of the British way of life". The Commissioner has
also been lobbied hard by British all-party MEPs who are strongly in
support of an extension to the exemptions. One solution which may be put
forward in the Green Paper would be to carry on with sectorial block
exemptions. Another would be to base exemptions on the market share of the
company operating the restrictive agreements. In the meantime, when Mr Van
Miert makes a formal proposal for the extension of the rules, his decision
must be approved by the full team of Commissioners.

Threat to "real ale"?

Meanwhile, a meeting in Brussels on October 11 between Commission
officials and the European brewers' lobby group, the Confederation des
Brasseurs du Marche Commun, failed to make much progress towards solving a
dispute over tied tenancy rules allowing pubs tied to national brewers to
sell a beer from another, i.e. foreign, brewer only if it has been
produced by traditional "real ale"-making methods. The Commission is
worried that this discriminates against beer imported from other EU
countries, where beer is rarely cask-conditioned. But the UK is now
threatening to drop the "guest beer" provision altogether if it is forced
under Community law to include continental European lagers in the
definition of a "guest beer".

SPIRITS: RUSSIAN AND CHILEAN "PROTECTIONISM" CRITICISED

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

New Russian plans to limit vodka and ethyl alcohol imports from the
beginning of 1997 have sent a tremor through Brussels. The hangover from
the measures announced by Moscow could mean a serious drop in EU sales in
1997 - 50 million litres instead of the 200 million litres exported in
1995. EU officials thought they were seeing double when they learnt of
these new Russian plans, since negotiations were in theory still under way
on current limits on vodka imports following Commissioner van den Broek's
trip to Russia in March. There is no justification for introducing new
unilateral safeguard measures, the Commission said on October 9. The
threat to outlets in Russia is not the only thing worrying EU spirits
producers, who are still voicing loud complaints about discriminatory
taxes applied to alcoholic drinks in Chile.

Russian unilateralism.

Negotiations on a possible ceiling for EU (and Belgian, in particular)
exports of vodka to Russia started back in March following a visit by EU
External Relations Commissioner Hans van den Broek. Following the Russian
announcement of import restrictions, the Commission said that, until it
had received more information, consultations would continue between EU and
Russian negotiators in the framework of the Interim trade Agreement
between the two sides, which came into force on February 1, 1996. The
Commission reckons that imports of ethyl alcohol in 1995 and 1996 did not
harm Russian domestic interests at all and thus there was no justification
for the unilateral introduction of safeguard measures. Besides, protective
measures of this kind go against the letter and the spirit of the Interim
Agreement. Brussels has now asked the Russian authorities to continue
consultations on the issue and - pending their outcome - to suspend the
safeguard measures.

This is not the first time the EU has had to remind the Russians of their
obligations under the Interim Agreement. Under a unilateral trade rule
imposed by the Russian authorities on March 13, EU exporters of vodka were
required to sell into Russia at a minimum price of USD8.2 per litre,
putting them at an obvious competitive disadvantage to vodka exporters in
the Commonwealth of Independent States, who are subject to a minimum price
of USD3.8 per litre. The new rule not only hit EU vodka suppliers and
their estimated ECU 200 million trade with Russia; it also dealt another
blow to EU confidence in the reliability of the Russian signatures on the
trade pact with the EU.

In 1994, the EU Member States exported ECU 266 million worth of alcoholic
drinks to Russia (including ECU 167 million worth of vodka). This figure
was almost reached in the first eight months of 1995, when EU sales of
alcohol to Russia were worth ECU 240 million (including 150 million
generated from vodka sales).

Discriminatory Chilean taxes.

Having seen their long-running campaign against Japan's alcohol taxes
vindicated in the World Trade Organisation, European spirit producers are
now turning their attention to Chile's taxes which, they say, discriminate
against foreign spirit imports. The Confederation of European Spirits
Producers (CEPS) welcomed the recent decision by the WTO's Appellate Body
to uphold an earlier ruling by the Dispute Settlement Body, that Japan's
tax regime discriminated against foreign imports. But CEPS President
Christian Delclaux warned on October 8 that similar rules were being
planned in Chile. "Given the WTO ruling, we are amazed at reports that the
Chilean administration is now proposing to submit GATT-inconsistent
legislation to the Congress", he said.

Mr Delclaux says although the new proposals address Chile's current
discrimination, they would still maintain differences in taxes.
"Maintaining such a wide variation in the levels of taxation is
discriminatory - and the WTO has just affirmed this fact", he pointed out.
"If Chile believes this is an acceptable solution, it is sadly mistaken.
Indeed, I am certain that if producers and exporters of Chilean wines were
treated in a similar discriminatory manner in, for example, the United
Kingdom - their second largest export market - they would feel likewise."

Chile - and, to a certain extent, South Korea - the alcohol tax regime
bears remarkable similarities to that of Japan. Under current Chilean law,
whisky is taxed at a rate of 70% ad valorem at wholesale. Other spirits
are taxed at 30%, while pisco, the country's top selling local brew, is
taxed at 25%. Mr Delclaux says that the current differentials should be
removed by applying a uniform tax rate, based on alcohol content, for all
spirits.

EU producers set out trade objectives

European spirits producers have meanwhile welcomed EU External Relations
Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan's support for their tariff and other
objectives for the WTO Ministerial Conference in Singapore in December and
the subsequent work programme. Much of what the European spirits industry
is seeking is very close to the Commissioner's own thinking for Singapore
and the WTO's work in coming years, according to the CEPS. Sir Leon has
also said the Commission will continue to work closely with the industry
to promote the shared objective of improving market access for European
exporters throughout the world. "Given that the value of EU spirits
exports to markets outside Europe totals nearly 4,000 million ECU, the
Commissioner's personal endorsement of our WTO objectives, especially
improved market access for distilled spirits in world markets, is most
welcome", said CEPS President Christian Delclaux on October 17.

CEPS is urging the Commission to help secure at the Singapore Ministerial
"substantial reductions" in the import tariffs applied to distilled
spirits beyond those agreed in the Uruguay Round in 1994. This includes
expansion of the 'zero for zero' import tariff phasing-out arrangements
for brown spirits, e.g. Cognac and Scotch Whisky (agreed by the EU,
Canada, Japan and the United States) to encompass all spirits and liqueurs
and extension of the arrangements to other WTO signatories.

EXTRACTION SOLVENTS: COMMISSION PROPOSED TO UPDATE 1988 DIRECTIVE

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

To take account of scientific and technical progress, the European
Commission is proposing to amend for the third time Directive 88/344/EEC
on the approximation of the laws of the Member States on extraction
solvents used in the production of foodstuffs and food ingredients. The
proposed changes concern mainly the use of certain solvents, their
conditions of use and maximum residue limits in food. The European
Parliament has just given its stamp of approval to the proposal during its
October 23 plenary session in Strasbourg.

According to the draft Directive, the Annex to Directive 88/344/EEC would
be amended as follows:

In Part I, the substance butyl acetate is deleted (as it is no longer used
in agri-industry).

In Part II:

The entry for hexane is modified.

In Part III, the substance methyl-propanol-1 is deleted and in its place
1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane is added with a maximum residue limit of 0.02
mg/kg in the foodstuff due to the use of extraction solvents in the
preparation of flavourings from natural flavouring materials.

The Member States must amend their laws, regulations and administrative
provisions so as to authorise trade in products complying with this
Directive by July 1, 1997 at the latest, and must ban trade in products
not complying with this Directive from January 1, 1998 onwards.

INWARD PROCESSING: COOPERATIVES OPPOSE EU COMMISSION PROPOSAL

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

French agricultural cooperatives - whether involved in upstream farm
production or downstream in the agri-food processing industry - are up in
arms about a draft proposal from the European Commission that seeks to
amend arrangements for access to international trade. The cooperatives are
particularly critical of the proposed changes to the inward processing
regime which attracts a wide range of agricultural products. The draft has
also been given a cautious welcome by European agri-food industry
specialists. But there may be room for improvement as, according to some
sources, it appears that the future rules for the system of inward
processing traffic have not yet been finalised within the Commission's
Directorate-General XXI (Customs and Indirect Taxation).

The inward processing regime is a system that enables goods to be imported
into EU customs territory for processing - without having to pay customs
duties. The only condition required of these goods is that they are
immediately re-exported outside the EU after processing, other wise they
will be liable for normal customs duties. In their position paper, the
French farm cooperatives, who are supported in their quest by cooperatives
in other EU Member States, reckon that this system cannot provide an
adequate response to the new, liberal regime ushered in by the GATT
Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture and can only be regarded as an
exceptional regime.

Widening its scope, say the cooperatives, would "not be compatible with
global respect for  Community preference". Not can it provide an
alternative to the traditional, unsatisfactory, policy of export
restitutions.

They also feel the Commission's draft proposal will risk encouraging
production of agricultural raw materials to move elsewhere: since the
"substitutability" of foodstuffs cannot rely solely on volume and price
equivalents. The farmers say what is needed is a "material yield"
equivalent, enabling a qualitative differentiation to be made on the basis
of raw material accounting. The processing stage between import and export
of a food product must be visible through the use of two different customs
tariffs, one on the way in and one on the way out. The French cooperatives
reckon that the proposed reform goes against the policy guidelines
requested by the farming industry itself.

The European Commission's draft proposal assumes that the GATT Agreement
on Agriculture has restored world market prices for agricultural products
to normal. But this hypothesis, according to the cooperatives, needs to be
given more in-depth consideration because there is still considerable
speculation son markets that are supposed to be better governed nowadays.
To sum up, the French farm cooperatives really want to see a simpler,
clearer and less expensive system. Above all, they cite the principle of
acceleration and greater transparency of the system, the need for faster
clearance of the backlog of requests for licences and recourse to
computerised means of transmission.

RURAL DEVELOPMENT: EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT CALLS FOR RURAL CHARTER

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

The EU's Common Agricultural Policy should be subsumed under a wider
European rural policy which will include objectives such as help to rural
communities and other measures which are complementary to agricultural
policy goals. This idea is part of a report from Irish MEP Liam Hyland
officially adopted by a plenary session of the European Parliament in
Strasbourg on October 25. Mr Hyland's report argues that sensible use of
the rural environment is the basis for all good spatial and resource

planning and calls for an EU "Rural Charter" to be drawn up forthwith.

Enlargement of EU "rural" areas.

Mr Hyland points out that following the accession of Sweden, Finland and
Austria approximately one quarter of the Union's population now live in
rural communities, and that rural areas account for almost 85% of the
surface area of the European Union. As the European Union expands over the
next decade to take in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, whose
farming conditions are very different, it "makes sense to review the
present arrangements, and to adapt and amplify them where necessary with a
view to achieving a strengthened and mutually consistent body of measures
which allows the mobilisation of a maximum of synergies and leads
progressively to an integrated rural policy," says the European
Commission's November 1995 White Paper on "Future Strategies for the CAP".

However, Mr Hyland points out that there is not even a definition of the
word "rural" on which all Member States agree. A number of Member States
use a population threshold (France, Spain, Italy, Ireland, Germany)
although the population threshold used differs. Other countries use a
planning-based approach (Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Luxembourg and the
United Kingdom). The OECD uses a definition based on a population of less
than 150 per km2; Eurostat uses 100 inhabitants per km2. The proposed
Council of Europe Charter avoids using a precise figure, defining an area
of the countryside as rural when the "main part" is used for agriculture,
forestry, aquaculture and fisheries, for the economic and cultural
activities of country-dwellers, for non-urban recreation and leisure and
for other purposes such as housing. Mr Hyland wants a single clear
definition agreed that can be used in all discussions on rural affairs.

The problems of rural areas.

In the Commission paper on "The Future of Rural Society", problems of
rural areas are analysed under three categories:

- areas "suffering from the pressures of modern life", near towns and
cities in areas of heavy population, particularly in the centre-north of
the Community and in many coastal regions.

- areas suffering from "rural decline", such as several regions in Greece,
the Mezzogiorno, inland Spain and Portugal, and the island of Ireland.
Here agriculture is still important but farms are often so small that they
can barely provide a living for one person and the absence of alternative
employment lead to a drift from the land, especially among the young.

-"remote areas", e.g. mountain regions

Mr Hyland identifies two common misconceptions. Although there are some
parts of the EU where rural areas have been abandoned and depopulated,
this is not universal. The decline in numbers of farmers during the 1970s
and 1980s is often cited as an important effect on rural areas, but this
decline has been replaced in very many parts of the Community with an
inflow of population from elsewhere. Nevertheless, the "drift from the
land" persists in Greece, Ireland, some parts of Italy, Spain and Portugal
and in some areas of France, the Scottish Highlands, many islands, higher
parts of the Alps and Pyrenees, the Massif Central, the West of Ireland,
and some mountain areas in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal. The
rapporteur also sees the need for a fourth category since the accession of
the Member States having Nordic regions, which are characterised by a very
low population density.

Secondly, contrary to general belief, overall unemployment in the rural
areas of the Community is not greater than in urban areas, and
unemployment for males is generally lower in rural areas. Within this
overall picture, however, there are sharp differences. Rural unemployment
is largely a matter of agricultural under-employment: the Commission
estimates that almost one third of all farmers in the Community are
underemployed - i.e. they work less than 50% of a normal working year on
their farm and have no other gainful employment. However, the problem of
female unemployment in rural areas is one which warrants special
attention. Precise EU data on this is not currently available, a point
which the Commission ought to remedy soon, reckons Liam Hyland.

The Community role.

The share of the Structural Fund budget for 1989-1993 devoted to rural
development will double from the present approximately 15 billion ECU to
approximately 30 billion ECU in 1994-1999.

The rapporteur believes we cannot simply establish a rural policy in the
way we have established agricultural policy - dealing with specific
market, with specific mechanisms, and finance. This is true partly due to
the the principle of subsidiarity - it is the Member States who currently
propose programmes to the Commission, which are then negotiated in
partnership to establish broad framework policies and objectives, and
which the Community co-finances (50% in most cases, 65% in Objective 1
cases). National and regional authorities have primary responsibility for
dealing with rural affairs through their policies on land, taxation,
development, training, administration etc. "Community action can only be
part of the total, and, being realistic, only a small part", says Liam
Hyland. However, the rapporteur believes the development of an integrated
rural policy, based on the principles of a European Rural Charter, will
enable the "rural dimension" to be taken into consideration in the
elaboration of these various policies, both nationally and at EU level,
which is not the case at the moment.

Principles of Rural Development.

Rural development must enshrine the right of all sectors of rural society
to participate in economic activity, stresses the report, setting out five
central areas of policy concern which have to be addressed; it is the
combination of these actions that will lead toward the principal objective
of maintaining viable rural communities, which in turn depends on tackling
the most fundamental problem of rural areas, which is unemployment, says
Liam Hyland. The five areas are:

Agricultural adjustment to new world trends - increasing world competition
and increasing mobility of capital and labour- by continuing to adapt
agriculture to the needs of the market place, while investing in new
developments such as planned forestry, organic production and the creation
of non-food energy sources. Farmers should also be encouraged to maintain
an attractive, diverse and ecologically rich rural environment, which
includes organic production. Such support should facilitate land mobility
through schemes for young farmers.

Industry and enterprise. Growth in rural employment will not come from
agriculture alone, or from forestry, but will be replaced by the growth of
alternative economic sectors such as tourism or development based on new
technologies and telecommunication, in which the rural areas will provide
advantages over urban areas for the development of service industries.

Environmental sustainability and cultural preservation. Farmers have an
important role as guardians of the countryside, and that as such they
ought to be paid for that role. We have to secure and sustain a
countryside which is clean, attractive and rich in wildlife, historical
features, preserving the rich traditions of culture built up over
thousands of years, while developing recreational opportunities, says the
report.

Rural communities. One of the most important issues for rural communities
is the shortage of rural housing. One of the problems in this respect has
been the environment: any approach to develop new land for building is
often resisted on environmental grounds. Local authorities must have a
positive housing programme for rural areas, which should include the
upgrading and preservation of existing housing stock.

Planning and land use. It is important to overcome the popular belief that
the countryside is under constant threat, because this leads to the '`no
development" ethic that is damaging to rural economies and rural
societies, says Liam Hyland. What is needed is a land use policy which is
tailored to specific areas and needs, and which allows for the proper
integrated use of land for agriculture, forestry, leisure, tourism,
industrial development and housing. It is better to consider the use of
good quality land for development where it might have greater economic or
amenity use than as setaside land on which nothing is done, environmental
degradation takes place, and costs increase yearly, stresses the
rapporteur.

COMMISSION PROPOSES TO ALLOW MORE WAXES FOR USE ON FRUIT

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

Under pressure from the fruit trade, represented by the European Union of
the Fruit and Vegetable Wholesale, Import and Export Trade (EUCOFEL), the
European Commission has proposed to allow three more waxes to be used on
fruit in the EU. The proposal to extend the list of waxes allowed for use
on fruit forms part of a proposal for a European Parliament and Council
Directive to amend the basic Directive on food additives other than
colours and sweeteners that the Commission tabled earlier this Autumn.
According to the new proposal, the following waxes will be allowed for
surface treatment only on fresh avocados, mangoes, papayas and melons:

E905 Microcrystalline wax (maximum level permitted: 140 mg/kg)

E912 Montanic acid esters: (quantum satis*)

E914 O oxidized polyethylene wax: (quantum satis)

The proposal has been sent to the European Parliament and the Council of
Ministers for approval, but the legislative process may take months, if
not years.

* The quantum satis principle means that no maximum level is specified,
but additives, such as waxes, may be used in accordance with good
manufacturing practice, at a level not higher than is necessary to achieve
the intended purpose and provided that the consumer is not misled.

EU MAKES NEW ATTEMPT TO LEGISLATE ON FOOD IRRADIATION

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

After the failed attempts by successive Council Presidencies in the late
1980s, early 1990s to get a Community Directive on irradiation of
foodstuffs adopted, mainly because of strong opposition from Germany and
Luxembourg to the very principle, the European Commission is having
another go now. It recently sent the Council of Ministers two draft
Directives which it hopes the Irish Presidency can steer through the
legislative process.

The first proposal is for a general framework Directive laying down
general rules on the conditions applicable to food irradiation, and the
second is an implementing Directive, establishing a positive list of
foodstuffs for which irradiation would be authorised throughout the EU.

If the Council adopts the proposals, Member States would no longer be able
to ban the marketing of irradiated foodstuffs, if these meet the
requirements laid down in the framework Directive. So far, the proposal
only allows irradiation for herbs, spices and vegetable seasonings. On
this point, the Commission is treading cautiously after its earlier
proposals for a much wider range of food products were watered down to
cover only herbs and spices. International organisations like the UN Food
and Agriculture Organisation, the International Atomic Energy Agency and
the World Health Organisation have issued a number of studies and
statements showing no risk to human health from correct use of irradiation
techniques.

On the whole, Member States seem to accept this new approach, according to
trade sources, but differences of opinion remain as regards the need for
labelling of irradiated foodstuffs, and the need to continue national
authorisations to irradiate certain types of food.

The draft framework Directive says that irradiation may only be authorised
when there is a clear benefit for the consumer. Moreover, it stresses that
labelling to inform the customer that irradiation treatment has been used
is necessary in almost all cases.

DAIRY POLICY: MEMBER STATES' "INCOMPATIBLE OBJECTIVES" FOR MILK SECTOR

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

Some EU Member States want to cut back dairy quotas in order to maintain
prices, some would be happy to see Community prices fall to world levels,
accompanied by an across-the-board increase in production quotas to
maintain income, others are clamouring for milk production rights to be
"more fairly" redistributed, a few countries place the emphasis on
expanding exports to the world market, while others again are more
interested in social protection for their dairy farmers. This is the
situation facing European Commission sector experts as they wrestle with
draft proposals designed to take the Community milk industry into the next
century. The proposals, which will seek to define options for an EU
strategy towards the world trade talks at the turn of the century to
continue the reforms agreed under the GATT Uruguay Round, is due to be
tabled by EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler in the early part of 1997.
Recent discussions within the Council's Special Committee on Agriculture
indicate however that progress on the dossier may not be swift.

Trade liberalism and East Europe.

EU dairy production is destined to be one of the next farm sectors to
undergo upheavals as part of the continuing reform of the Common
Agricultural Policy (CAP). The Netherlands, which takes over the rotating
EU Council Presidency on January 1, has announced its intention of
addressing the subject at the informal Farm Council in May 1997. The next
round of multilateral trade negotiations under the auspices of the World
Trade Organisation (WTO) are likely to have a more radical impact on farm
trade liberalisation than the ones concluded under the GATT Uruguay Round
in 1994 and not just because they are largely intended to continue the
reform process begun with the GATT Agreement on Agriculture. Not only is
the free market philosophy gaining strength around the world, but radical
solutions may have to be found if the emerging economies of the Central
and East European countries (CEECs) are to be incorporated into the
European Union and the international trade scene in general.

EU the world's N #  1.

The European Union currently has around 21 million head of dairy cattle,
producing some 110 million tonnes of milk annually, out of a world total
fluctuating around 520 million tonnes. EU exporters hold more than 40% of
the world market, way ahead of nearest rivals New Zealand (16%) and
Australia (9%). The Community sets an annual intervention price at which
public authorities are obliged to buy in milk and butter of the required
quality, and also pays export refunds to bridge the gap between EU and
world prices.

Prices set to fall.

Under the GATT Agreement on Agriculture, which brought the farm sector
into the international trade framework for the first time, the initial
tariff levels designed to replace trade barriers were set so high that the
mandatory phased reductions are currently having little effect on the
market. However, further tariff cuts would almost certainly force producer
prices down. A report drawn up by Professor S.J Sheehy of University
College Dublin* sees prices falling by as much as 5% per year towards
2010, whether or not the EU decides to maintain its production quota
system. The report assumes the EU will make arrangements to compensate
farmers for the drop in income they will suffer in the early part of the
21st century, as was the case following the "MacSharry" reform of the CAP
in 1992. Under the GATT Agreement, direct income payments to farmers are
exempt from the obligation to reduce aggregate levels of support, and the
Community will come under increasing pressure from the US and other
trading partners to further decouple aid payments from prices.

The main options.

Professor Sheehy argues it will be impossible to maintain both the present
quota system, whereby each Member State is allocated a maximum quantity of
milk it may produce, alongside the high prices the EU has been at pains to
maintain through its aid and intervention scheme. If tariffs are cut
further, prices are certain to fall. A "fortress Europe" approach,
rejecting international calls for reduced tariffs but agreeing to trim
export subsidies instead, would imply buying back some 10% of farmers'
production rights to bring supply and demand into balance, says the report.

CEEC accession.

However, this approach would pose serious questions for the integration of
the CEEC candidates into the European Union. Maintaining quotas while
allowing prices to gravitate downwards towards international market levels
might solve this problem, provided a long-enough transition period for
CEEC accession is agreed, reckons the Irish Professor. A more radical
option would be to abolish quotas altogether ahead of, or just after, the
next WTO accord. In the short term, this would place an enormous burden on
the EU farm budget, as dairy producers would have to be compensated for
sharply-falling prices, but it would quickly align Community production
with the world market, and have the advantage that the thorny question of
quota allocation and compensation payments to the new CEEC Member States
would not arise.

The Sheehy report has brought plaudits from free-trade supporters Denmark,
Sweden and the UK, who welcome the chance to view the EU dairy regime in
the wider context of world trade. However, a majority of the Member States
feel that the quota system should be determined in the light of the
Community's internal policy aims, rather than merely commercial aspects.
The French in particular have described the document as "too biased
towards trade liberalisation". France is the EU's second largest dairy
producer, with a guaranteed quantity around 24 million tonnes of milk a
year.

Quotas needed to preserve farming?

Germany, the EU's leading dairy producer, Austria, Portugal and
Luxembourg, believe the quota system is the only sensible way of limiting
production and stabilising the market, and should be extended beyond the
deadline of 2001. Bonn would like to see a 5% cut in quotas to firm up
prices, while Vienna argues that farming would die out in some mountainous
and other less-favoured regions without a structured system of dairy
production. Portugal would reluctantly accept quota cuts as a necessary
evil to maintain prices.

Dual pricing system.

Belgium, Ireland, and the Netherlands are unconvinced of the need to act
urgently. They believe gradual price cuts towards world levels in the
medium term will obviate any potential problems with CEEC accession, and
that there is no need to abolish quotas. Meanwhile the French are pressing
the case for a dual pricing system to balance the internal and external
needs of the Community, and the Danes, who reluctantly admit that
abolishing quotas may be politically unfeasible, have suggested the
introduction of "A" and "B" quotas along the lines of the sugar regime
(see separate article on sugar). "B" quota milk could be exported without
refunds, they argue, without the risk of forcing down world prices.

Export vocation vital.

In spite of their conflicting views on practical strategies, France,
Ireland, the Netherlands and Denmark all agree on one basic point: it is
vital that EU dairymen are able to go on exporting to the world
marketplace. The Irish and Dutch also back the UK view that compensation
paid to farmers should be granted on the basis of uniform economic
criteria. They argue that other Community objectives such as help for
small farmers, young farmers, less-favoured areas, etc ought to be dealt
with through separate instruments. Member States opposed to this hard
stance reckon that some modulation should be envisaged in order to target
support where it is most needed. A senior Commission official tasked with
the dossier lamented recently that so far the debate had done no more than
reveal the Member States' "incompatible objectives".

UK MEAT PLANT THROUGHPUT DIPS 7% IN FIRST 8 MONTHS OF 1996

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

During the first eight months of 1996, meat plant throughput in the United
Kingdom declined by 7% on corresponding 1995 levels to just under 22
million head, according to the Irish Food Board's Market Monitor bulletin.
Cattle throughput was 32% lower than last year at 1.5 million head. Sheep
supplies at 11.2 million head were 6% lower while pig throughput declined
by 3% to 9.3 million head.

Steer throughput up to the end of August was 28% lower than last year at
569,000 head. Heifer supplies declined by 25% while cow throughput was 64%
lower at 186,000 head. The reason for this decline is that since April an
average of 30,000 cattle per week have been removed from the food chain
through the over-30-month culling programme to help combat "mad cow
disease" (BSE). Young bull throughput over the period increased by 3% on
1995 levels to 269,000 head.

Lamb throughput up to the end of August at 9.7 million head was 6% below
corresponding 1995 levels. Cull ewe supplies declined by 5% to 1.5 million
head, according to the Irish Food Board, An Bord Bia.

Supplies of fattening pigs were 3% lower during the first eight months of
1996 at 9.1 million head. Sow throughput over the period fell by 11% to
total 216,000 head.

SAUDI ARABIA RE-OPENS FOR IRISH BEEF

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

The Saudi Arabian Ministry for Foreign Affairs has announced that it is
lifting its temporary ban on imports from Ireland of frozen and chilled
beef and veal, milk and milk products from cattle, beef gelatine, food
products containing milk and gelatine products derived from cattle and
bovine products used in veterinary and medical preparations, cosmetics and
drugs. All these products neverthelss have to be accompanied by a
certificate stating they are BSE free.

These products are allowed entry to Saudi Arabia through the ports of the
Netherlands and Belgium, on condition that they stay on the same vessel
for the duration of the journey and are not unloaded in other ports which
they may pass through.

The Saudis have also agreed to lift the ban on imports from Switzerland
and France for the same products.

MAD COW DISEASE: MIXED SIGNALS FROM COMMISSION ON "PROVEN" BSE/CJD LINK

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

The European Commission sent out mixed signals on October 24 to news that
UK scientists may have proved a direct link between bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) and a new variant of the human brain condition
Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (dubbed by experts "vCJD"). Speaking at a press
conference in Paris, EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler said he thought
in the light of the new findings, the European Union ought to bring in
stricter legislation on consumption of animal offal, and stressed that the
UK authorities should now proceed with the planned targeted cull of some
150,000 cattle, suspended by the Major Government in mid-September.
Meanwhile back in Brussels, a Fischler aide spoke of both positive and
negative aspects of the scientific discovery. The negative side, he said,
was the obvious public health risk, now shown to be very real, that eaters
of infected beef tissue may have contracted brain disease. The positive
element consisted in the fact that the new discovery would make it easier
to trace animals incubating the disease, he stressed.

BSE and vCJD prions "match".

The British scientific journal Nature carried a report on October 23 of a
new technique developed by Dr John Collinge and his colleagues in the
Prion disease Group at Imperial College School of Medicine, London, for
tracing the "molecular marker" of the prion protein which causes the brain
tissue of sufferers to degenerate into a spongy mass. "The biochemical
signature of prions in patients who died from new variant CJD matches that
of prions in mice and macaque monkeys experimentally infected with BSE,
but differs from that of prions in human patients with acquired or
sporadic CJD", says the Nature report. This finding "greatly strengthens
the conclusion that vCJD is a consequence of the BSE epidemic in British
cattle", it goes on. The new technique is likely to form the basis of a
rapid diagnostic test for spongiform encephalopathies, say the experts.

Further safety precautions?

Reacting to the news, a European Commission spokesman stressed that the EU
executive had been proceeding on the assumption of a BSE/CJD link for some
time and that all necessary measures to protect the public were already in
place. The new study would go to the EU scientific committees for
examination, and any necessary new proposals would be made on the basis of
their recommendations, the spokesman explained. However, from Paris, Franz
Fischler indicated to the press that he would be re-tabling to the Farm
Council on October 28 proposals to completely exclude from the food chain
those cattle and sheep tissues found most likely to transmit the BSE agent.

Harmonisation needed.

The legal situation regarding use of brain, eyes, spinal cord, nervous
tissues, spleen and lymph glands (shown to be capable of transmitting the
fatal prions) from cattle and sheep varies across the European Union. The
only EU-wide statute on the subject relates to UK bovine tissues, which
are banned from export. Also, ruminant waste may not be fed to cattle and
sheep, but does constitute an important ingredient in the meat and bone
meal still fed to pigs, chickens and other farm animals. The French
authorities paved the way towards tighter rules in June, when they banned
from both human foodstuffs and all animal feeds the tissues in question,
from cattle aged over 6 months and sheep and goats aged over one year.
Ireland and the UK have brought in similar regulations. Mr Fischler
believes Member States' rules should now be harmonised on the French
model. However, a proposal to that effect he tabled to the Council in July
met with little enthusiasm from the EU Standing Veterinary Committee.

The French Agriculture Ministry gave a favourable reaction on October 25
to an announcement by the Bonn authorities of a new national legislative
Bill that would, in line with French law, ban all imports from France of
the sensitive tissues. The Ministry welcomed the move, as likely to foster
EU-wide harmonisation of measures. The German Government has since July
maintained a unilateral ban on all products containing beef tissues from
the UK and Switzerland, the two main centres of the BSE epidemic in Europe.

Confusion over "regional approach".

Meanwhile confusing messages emerged from Luxembourg on October 28
regarding the UK's strategy for eradicating BSE and ending the embargo on
British beef products. UK Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg, in town for
the EU Farm Council, told the press corps he was not pressing for a
regional approach to lifting the ban, but would be trying to make progress
towards resumption of beef exports "from certified herds". These would be
pedigree grass-fed herds whose owners can prove they have never used the
suspect mammalian meat and bone meal (MBM) blamed for spreading the
disease to feed their livestock.

However, the presence of Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth in the UK
delegation sent out a different signal. Both Scotland and the UK province
of Northern Ireland have a large number of such herds. Earlier, the Farm
Council President-in-Office Ivan Yates told the press corps that a
regional proposal "could be considered", provided the agreed targeted cull
of cattle most at risk from BSE were implemented in that region. "A
special case can be made for Northen Ireland because of their animal
identification system and that they are surrounded by water", said the
Irish Agriculture Minister. However, Douglas Hogg rejected the idea of
destroying cattle from herds already certified free of mad cow disease as
"irrelevant".

The implicit rejection of Mr Yates' support may be for UK domestic
consumption rather than for Mr Hogg's EU partners. Indeed the UK
authorities now appear to have given up hope of having the export embargo
- imposed on March 27 after the risk of human beings contracting
spongiform brain disease from BSE-infected cattle tissues came to light -
lifted for the whole of the country in the near future. The Major
Government decided in mid-September to suspend the selective cattle cull,
agreed as part of the "Florence framework" for gradually ending the ban,
and has now changed strategy in favour of the "certified herds" approach.

French MBM figures "correct".

However, the Irish Farm Minister was able to offer some relief to
Pierre-Mathieu Duhamel, the beleaguered Director of the French Customs
Service. Mr Duhamel's team has been widely accused in the French press of
laxity in tracing potentially infected MBM imported from the UK between
1993 and 1995 and fraudulently labelled as of Irish origin. Ivan Yates
confirmed on October 21 that the French figure of 59,873 tonnes for Irish
MBM exports to France during the period in question now appeared to be
"accurate". Dublin had originally declared a figure of just 25,815 tonnes,
leading to French fears that large quantities of suspect MBM had entered
the country illegally. The discrepancy appears to have arisen because
UK-based brokers continued to ship to France consignments of MBM which
they had purchased in Ireland, Mr Yates explained.

BEEF CRISIS: MINISTERS URGED TO SWALLOW THE MEDICINE

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

As Agri-Service International went to press in the afternoon of October
30, EU Farm Ministers meeting in Council in Luxembourg were well into
their third day of talks on proposed support and restructuring measures
for the beleaguered beef sector. A second compromise paper tabled by the
Irish Presidency to take account of the more strident objections from the
Member States delegations had secured the backing of EU Agriculture
Commissioner Franz Fischler, and Ministers were being urged by both
Presidency and Commission to swallow unpalatable measures in order to
finalise a deal. Among the most significant changes being proposed to the
original Commission document, the new draft includes a commitment to find
ECU 500 million for short-term support for farmers, an option for Member
States to encourage early marketing of both male and female beef cattle
instead of destroying them at birth, and a call for restrictions on import
of calves from Eastern Europe. However deciding on the ratio for
distribution of aid top-ups among the Member States remained the biggest
stumbling block to agreement.

The Fischler beef package.

A package of three linked proposals tabled by Farm Commissioner Franz
Fischler on July 30 calls for reductions in arable aid payments and cuts
in investment support to pay for higher beef intervention buying and other
short-term measures designed to absorb surplus EU beef production,
estimated at 1.2 million tonnes per year since consumption has fallen in
the wake of the "mad cow" crisis. Parliament used its urgency procedure to
vote an Opinion on the first part of the package - the purely beef sector
measures - on September 20, but refused to do the same for the
controversial arable aid cuts. The Commissioner has always expressed
reluctance to see the three elements split up. If measures costing over
ECU1 billion are to be agreed, then the Ministers should decide at the
same time where the money is coming from, insisted a Fischler aide.
However, a majority of Member States are in any case against the proposed
arable cuts.

Emergency measures already taken.

In fact, going into Council, Franz Fischler had already given away an
important bargaining chip in agreeing to raise the Community beef
intervention ceiling from 400,000 to 460,000 tonnes for 1996, and endorse
public buying-in of lighter cattle ("weanlings") under 300 kilogrammes in
weight. These decisions, voted through on a Commission proposal by
Ministers at the Fisheries Council on October 14, took some of the urgency
out of the issue, and the Member States' delegations were more inclined to
hold out for better terms for their farmers in the overall package. The
more intensive farming countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and
Belgium are opposed to moves to lower the regional stocking ceilings used
for calculating eligibility for special beef premium payments to farmers
and reduce the stocking levels for eligibility to the "extensification
premium". The Netherlands and Italy are unwilling to introduce the
new-born calf slaughter option, which they feel will outrage public
opinion, France wants to see premiums payable on suckler cows raised,
while Portugal is still fighting to maintain the second premium payable on
its older, extensively-raised, bulls.

Immediate cash commitment.

The most significant addition to the Fischler beef package is the
commitment to find ECU 500 million somewhere in the 1997 EU Agriculture
Budget to top up cattle farmers incomes for the second time since the BSE
crisis hit demand in April. In June, the Ministers agreed to provide ECU
850 million, with an added provision for Member States to match this
figure out of national funds. Earlier, the Farm Commissioner had suggested
there was no justification for further short-term support of this kind. A
report from the Commission Directorate-General for Agriculture (DGVI),
whose publication was temporarily blocked by French Commissioner Edith
Cresson on October 23, estimates beef producers' aggregate losses due to
the BSE crisis at ECU 1.277 billion (calculated per animal at ECU 65 for
males and ECU 45/ head for suckler cows) or at ECU 1.02 billion on a
production basis. Nevertheless, French calf producers are said to be
losing up to ECU 100 per head in the current depressed market for beef
animals.

Exports booming.

On October 25 the EU Beef and Veal Management Committee accepted a further
31,000 tonnes of prime beef, plus 180 tonnes of weanlings, into
intervention, bringing to 396,000 tonnes the total amount of beef carcases
now in public storage. The Commission spokesman stressed that 1996
intervention would not now approach the 720,000 tonnes foreseen in early
pessimistic scenarios at the height of the crisis. Exports from the Union
are now running well over 22,000 tonnes per week and some 100,000 tonnes
ahead of schedule for the year 1996/97, as foreign demand has picked up
again. However, the GATT Agreement on Agriculture limit on export of
subsidised EU beef is likely to be reached before June 1997, when the
problem will flare up again, he warned.

Finding the ECU 500 million.

All sides now agree that the manoeuvre of postponing until after October
15, 1997 part of the oilseeds advance payments for next year is the right
way of freeing up the necessary ECU 1.2 billion or so for intervention and
production-curtailment measures for 1997. However, uncertainty still
surrounds the question of just where the ECU 500 million extra top-up is
to be found. Following an agreement struck in Killarney in September,
Member States have made early disbursements totalling some ECU 230 million
on suckler cow premium payments and the EU Budget Authority will now be
asked to authorise the use of an equivalent amount from the 1997 budget.
That would leave ECU 270 million to be financed over the next twelve
months from savings on other expenditure items within the Farm Budget.

A further bone of contention is just which farmers will receive the agreed
aid top-up. Germany, alongside France one of the two major cattle
countries in the Community, received only 14% of the June package, while
the French producers carried off some 30% of the cash, stressed
Agriculture Minister Jochen Borchert. Hence Mr Borchert, backed by the
Irish delegation, wants a new "distribution key" to be worked out.

Compromise details.

Based on the July 30 proposals from EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler,
the Presidency compromise makes the following adjustments:

-the calf-processing premium ("Herod premium") designed to encourage
farmers to reduce future beef supplies by slaughtering new-born calves
would be compulsorily offered for dairy herds only; an early marketing
premium suggested by the German delegation would be available for both
male and female calves up to average slaughter weight less 20%. The EU
Management Committee would set the premium and the implementation rules
but the objective is to remove 1 million calves from production next year.

-intervention buying of weanlings, introduced on October 14 for 1996, to
be maintained only as an emergency measure for Autumn 1997

-the regional ceilings for the special beef premiums for both 1997 and
1998 to be cut back to current levels for Greece (to 140,130 head),
Austria (423,400), Portugal (154,897) and the UK (1,419,811). Spain to be
allowed a higher ceiling than under present arrangements

- a single premium to be set for bull headage payments at ECU130, which
represents a 19.6% increase on the present level of ECU 108.68 as against
the Commission proposal for a 14% increase to ECU 123.90

- the 1996 intervention ceiling to be raised to just 550,000, instead of
the 720,000 originally proposed, which would leave a capacity of a further
90,000 tonnes for this year

- an additional ECU 36/head for farmers who bring their cattle stocking
level under 1.4 livestock units per hectare and ECU 52 per head for levels
less than 1LU/ha.

Link with dairy reform?

In addition the Commission is asked to draft a proposal to change
legislation so that the East German Lander derogation on the 90-head herd
limit continues to apply until end 1998 and to draw up proposals for long
term measures by June 30, which would link beef sector structural measures
with plans for dairy reform. A number of delegations are unhappy however
to link these two distinct sectors.

CEEC imports attacked.

Following strong calls from a number of delegations to renegotiate
preferential cattle import arrangements with Central and East European
countries (CEEC), the compromise text calls on the Foreign Affairs Council
to take action along these lines. The Commission warns however that the
CEEC will justifiably demand compensation in other trade areas.

Beef for food aid?

Mr Yates also revealed on October 21 his ideas for shipping unmarketable
EU beef as food aid to the Third World. The Irish Agriculture Minister
said he would be making a proposal to this effect at the World Food
Summit, scheduled to take place in Rome from November 13 to 17. Since the
BSE crisis arose in March, public intervention stocks of Community beef
have risen from almost zero to just under 400,000 tonnes. This figure
could rise to 700,000 tonnes when pre-Winter selling gets under way,
reckons the European Commission. These quantities of meat are unlikely to
find a market abroad, given the continuous flow of new supplies, say the
experts. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates
that some 800 million people in the world currently suffer from
under-nutrition.

Identification and labelling.

The Council also took its first look at Commission proposals for cattle
identification and beef labelling rules. The idea is that all EU cattle
should be identified by means of an eartag and personal passport. As
regards labelling, individual producers and organisations would be
authorised to put in place voluntary schemes for providing the customer
with detailed information on their beef products. The draft Regulation
lays down what information may appear on a label (for details see last
issue of Agri-Service International ), and lays down rules for verifying
the truth of any claims made. The Commission hopes this scheme will be up
and running by January 1997, but the European Parliament will need to
register its Opinion before the Council can go ahead and adopt the
legislation. Meanwhile Ministers have sent the dossier to the Committee of
Member States' Permanent Representatives to the EU (COREPER) for further
work.

POTATOES: EU MARKET REGIME PROPOSALS SOON TO BE BURIED AGAIN

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

Despite renewed pressure from farmers' organisations, MEPs and the
authorities of a number of EU Member States for a formal Community market
regime to be established for potatoes, it now appears unlikely that this
will be achieved in the foreseeable future. The Irish Presidency of the EU
Council of Ministers has so far been unable to secure sufficient consensus
on the existing Commission proposals to justify bringing them back to the
Council table, while the Dutch, due to take over the Council chair on
January 1, are not convinced of the need to institute a Common Market
Organisation (CMO) in this sector. Meanwhile, the absence of any formal
Community-wide structure for potatoes leaves the market subject to sharp
fluctuations, allows individual Member States a free hand on allocating
national aid, and renders EU farmers vulnerable to low-priced imports from
third countries.

New calls for a CMO.

As hopes rose recently that the potato dossier might make progress under
the Irish Presidency of the EU, Spanish Socialist Members of the European
Parliament Jesus Cabezon Alonso and Juan Colino Salamanca raised a
parliamentary question with the Council of Ministers, the basic thrust of
which is to press for detailed regulation of the market "in order to
achieve better market balance, guarantee producers' incomes and prevent
distortions of competition (...)". Meanwhile COPA and COGECA, the EU
farmers' and farm cooperatives organisations, have issued a 6-point plan
for an EU potato regime. The plan, which insists on the need for an EU
Advisory Committee on Potatoes to assist the European Commission, calls
for:

- a common methodology to determine potato quality and to establish a
minimum quality standard to protect consumers from sub-standard or
diseased potatoes;

- a common methodology for the collection, analysis and distribution of
statistics;

- a modest fund for the setting-up of potato groups and industry
organisations in those Member States where such structures are weak;

- an occasional fund for the generic promotion of potatoes in high yield
years;

- funding for research and development into the safe use of modern
technology for growing, storing and presenting potatoes;

- potatoes to be brought within the general safeguard measures applicable
to all other crops to protect EU markets from subsidised or state-aided
imports from third countries.

"Light" regime proposed.

Proposals drafted by the European Commission as long ago as 1992 call for
the establishment of a "light" Community potato marketing regime
recognising and providing aid for setting up producer organisations which
would take responsibility for selling all the produce of their members.
The producer groups would also organise research and development of better
strains and run generic promotion campaigns for potatoes. Quality
standards would also be established under Management Committee procedures,
and the Commission empowered to take action against excessive imports, by
requiring import licences.

No consensus.

Consensus within the Council's Special Committee on Agriculture has proved
hard to achieve, however. Southern Member States such as Italy, Spain and
Portugal are in favour of formal regulation of the market, but would
prefer to see potatoes included in the fruit and vegetables CMO, which
also provides for aided withdrawal of surpluses and other market
interventions of a "heavier" nature. France and the UK have been urging
Ivan Yates, the President-in-Office of the Farm Council, to push the
dossier forward, but London is categorically opposed to aided withdrawals
of surplus produce from the market, and wants potatoes kept strictly
separate from other, more perishable, fruit and vegetables.

Like the UK, the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium have their own national
potato marketing bodies, and are thus allied with the Swedes and Danes,
who are basically against instituting new sector regimes. Under EU
legislation, the state aid rules laid down in Articles 92-94 of the Treaty
do not apply to farm sectors not governed by a CMO.

"Illogical" absence of regulation.

A sector expert from the COPA/COGECA tandem described the situation as an
"illogical" gap in the completion of the Single Market. Potatoes are one
of the most important farm products for which no market organisation has
so far been established. With a total cultivated area of 1,334,000
hectares, potatoes constitute a substantial crop in the European Union.
They are grown in all the Member States, although because of climatic and
soil conditions, they are more widely grown in Northern regions. The Union
is in fact self-sufficient in potatoes, with the exception of early
varieties, which are imported in Winter and early Spring from
Mediterranean countries when limited Community production is available.
The main suppliers are Egypt, Morocco and Cyprus. During the past few
years an annual average of some 400,000 tonnes of early potatoes have been
imported from third countries.

However, the potato market is highly weather-dependent and is notoriously
characterised by wide fluctuations in crop yields from year to year.
Growers' incomes are highly uncertain. Farmers react quickly to rising
prices during shortages by planting extra acreage for the following
harvest, which in turn drives the price sharply down again. In 1994 for
example, when drought affected both quantity and quality, prices rose
steeply, only to fall back again during 1995, when the harvest was much
better. The sector is also vulnerable to speculation, as potatoes can be
stored for a much longer period than many other vegetables.

PROGRESS ON FRENCH APPLE EXPORTS TO JAPAN

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

Great strides have been made in the long-running negotiations on French
apple exports to Japan, to the extent that a date for the start of French
shipments can now be envisaged. French diplomatic sources have revealed
that considerable progress has been made over the last year on the
technical level, with only a few details blocking a final agreement. Paris
is anxious to tie up the ends of the technical dossier and agree a "start
date" to be announced during President Jacques Chirac's state visit to
Japan beginning on November 17.

Japan recently appointed experts in France to examine how French farmers
are combating insect parasites which are endemic to apples in Europe but
unknown in Japan. Concerns over plant health are generally regarded as the
principal obstacle to the sale of foreign apples in the archipelago.
Quoting unidentified Japanese Government sources, the English-language
daily the Japan Times has suggested the ban on the import of French apples
may be lifted by next Summer, provided no serious problems come to light
during testing in Japan.

French sources have been reluctant to confirm the Summer of 1997 as a
starting date for apple exports to Japan, pointing out that a date can
only be set following the results of public inquiry that has still to be
carried out. If all goes well, France, the world's leading exporter of
apples, will become the fourth country authorised to sell its fruit to
Japan after New Zealand, the United States and South Korea. However, it
remains to be seen whether French Golden Delicious apples will sell in
Japan, where consumers are partial to very large and attractive fruit. In
1995, imported apples accounted for less than 1% of the Japanese market
despite costing infinitely less than domestic apples.

DURUM WHEAT: COMMISSION SECTOR REFORM PROPOSALS BOGGED DOWN

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

European Commission plans to reform the management of the EU durum wheat
sector have run into opposition from Member States' negotiators in the
Council's Special Committee on Agriculture (SCA), and the new regime is
now unlikely to take effect in the coming marketing year. Although the
basic proposal to institute a Maximum Guaranteed Area for durum wheat
production and promote supplies of quality grains to the market would
rally a qualified majority in Council, the main producer Member States are
still squabbling over allocation of the 3-4 million hectares traditionally
sown to this crop in the Community, while some of the other countries want
official recognition of the "non-traditional" acreage on which their
farmers grow up to 400,000 hectares of hard wheat per year. If all
requests were to be granted, an extra million hectares of Community-aided
durum wheat would be added to the Commission draft, costing the CAP budget
a further ECU 280 million a year.

Injecting more flexibility into the durum sector.

The Commission's July 30 proposals are designed to loosen up what has
become a highly rigidified system and bring the sector into line with both
market disciplines and current farming structures. Younger farmers are
having particular difficulty in obtaining growing rights, which are tied
to the land, and the practice of "producing for aid" rather than for the
market, has become rife among some farmers, the Commission points out.
Meanwhile the EU processing industry has been importing heavily to ensure
supplies.

Under the present regime, aid is paid on an individual basis to producers
in the "traditional" growing areas whose acreage, calculated as the
highest area for which production aid was paid in one of the reference
years from 1988 to 1991, is listed in a register. This aid currently
amounts to ECU 358.6/tonne, based on the production aid paid before the
1992 CAP reform, plus the difference between the current intervention
price (aligned on that of other cereals) and the higher pre-reform
intervention price.

A 3 million hectare ceiling.

The Commission's solution to the imbalance which has developed, while at
the same time keeping a grip on budgetary expenditure, is to abolish
production registers and establish a Maximum Guaranteed Area (MGA) for
durum wheat, distributed according to traditional production totals.
However, the EU executive is proposing to base the MGA on aid applications
paid since the 1992 reform, for a total of 3 million ha, ranging from
1,610,000 ha for Italy to 35,000 for Portugal (see Agri-Service
International N 446 for full details), while registered acreages actually
amount to over 4 million ha.

Widening the scope.

Most delegations to the SCA support the Commission's general aim of
promoting adequate supply of quality durum wheat to the processing
industry by abolishing traditional monopolies on production rights and
granting aid only to those farmers who sow specified seed-types and grow
their crop through to maturity. However, producers have been lobbying
their governments to ensure they do not lose out proportionally to rivals
in other EU countries. Thus arguments within the SCA have aligned the
Member States into three groups: those with allocated MGAs are demanding
larger areas; those countries, including Austria, who have hitherto
benefited from "non-traditional" aid payments (amounting to some
ECU138.9/ha - i.e. half that payable on "traditional" areas) want their
production to be included in the scope of the new regime; some countries
who have never drawn aid in either category, such as Germany and the UK,
are insisting they too should be allocated a small "non-traditional" durum
acreage.

Faced with these extra demands, the major producers have countered by
demanding an allocation of non-traditional acreage on top of their
traditional area. The aggregate of all these requests would bring an added
550,000 ha of traditional and 400,000 ha of non-traditional durum
production within the aided regime.

TUNISIA ANTICIPATES ABUNDANT OLIVE HARVEST

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

Official estimates suggest olive oil production in Tunisia will exceed
200,000 tonnes in 1996/97, drawing a line under two years of poor
harvests. With crops ravaged by drought in 1994/95 and 1995/96, olive oil
production plummeted to 70,000 and 60,000 tonnes. Agriculture Minister
Mohamed Ben Rejeb has indicated that abundant production over the
forthcoming season, beginning in November, should result in a substantial
increase in olive oil exports and a resumption of normal supplies to local
markets that have been faced with shortages for more than a year.

Sales abroad were restricted last year to 26,000 tonnes, a little less
than half of the authorised quota for exports to the European Union,
Tunisia's principal customer. Under the terms of the Association Agreement
with the European Union signed in July 1995, Tunisia will enjoy
preferential conditions on the sale of 46,000 tonnes of olive oil per year
on the European market, up to the year 2000. According to the Assabah
daily, Mr Ben Rejeb is currently negotiating an increase in the European
quota to 60,000 tones per year.

The Minister is also reported to have warned exporters of a possible slump
in prices, particularly over the next three months. A floor price for
exports has been set at 2,900 Dinars per tonne, and storage capacity has
been raised this year to 250,000 tonnes. Olive oil is also expected to
return to the menu in Tunisian households, with the Minister forecasting a
fall in prices on the domestic market. The Tunisians, who traditionally
consume about 50,000 tonnes of olive oil per year, have been forced of
late to turn to cheaper imported and state subsidised vegetable oils.
Tunisia's leading agricultural export, olive oil earned the country an
average of USD200 million a year between 1991 and 1994.

WHEAT PRICES RISE AS MAIZE AND SOYA FALL

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

The price of wheat on the Chicago futures market is rising as rates for
maize and soya fall, although gains will be limited by the favourable
rains that have watered freshly-planted crops of Winter wheat in the
United States. Pressure on maize and soya prices was already building up
before the rains that have hampered harvesting in the Midwest. Jason
Roose, an analyst with US Commodities, has blamed the fall on hedging by
producers and storage companies.

Soya prices in particular have declined two weeks before the publication
of new production estimates by the United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA) which may raise forecasts, according to Mr Roose. With prices
sliding to USD6.97 per bushel at the end of morning trading on October 29,
speculation on whether soya should be trading above USD8 per bushel has
been replaced by conjecture as to whether prices should have fallen below
USD7.

In a separate development, analysts have yet to react to the decision by
the American tax authorities to ban farmers from deferring tax payments by
collecting revenue on current sales in January. American producers have
previously able to sell harvests at this stage of the year but defer
payment until January, so as to withhold payment of tax on these sales
until the following year. Under the new regulation, these sales will be
directly taxable.

CEREALS: INTERNATIONAL GRAINS COUNCIL RAISES 1996/97 CROP FORECASTS

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

The world cereals harvest for 1996/97 (July to June) should prove more
abundant that previously forecast, reckons the International Grains
Council (IGC), whose monthly report, out on October 24, raises production
estimates to 573 million tonnes for wheat and 875 million tonnes for
coarse grains (corn, barley, rye, sorghum, oats). The London-based
inter-governmental organisation has raised forecasts sharply to take
account of bumper harvests in the European Union, China and Australia.
Likewise, the United States maize harvest has exceeded expectations. The
increase in production in some regions has more than compensated for the
disappointing wheat harvests in Kazakhstan, Russia and the United States.
Last month, the IGC forecast harvests of 571 million tonnes for wheat and
869 million tonnes for coarse grains.

Stocks set to rise.

Following the mediocre crops of recent years, these plentiful wheat and
corn harvests should be reflected in an increase in world grain reserves.
World stocks of wheat are expected to rise to 104 million tonnes
(unchanged on the September estimate, see Table 17 below), an increase of
10 million tonnes in a single year. The estimate for reserves of coarse
grains has been raised from 100 to 105 million tonnes, 21 million tonnes
more than last year. The IGC has also increased its estimate for global
wheat consumption, which totalled 558 million tonnes in 1995/96, from 561
to 563 million tonnes.

Grain trade volume shrinks.

World trade in wheat is now put at 89 million tonnes, compared with a
September estimate of 88 million, still slightly less than the 90 million
tonnes bought and sold internationally in the 1995/96 marketing year. As
regards coarse grains, the IGC has reduced its September consumption
estimate of 856 million tonnes to 854 million, still a considerable
increase on the 831 million tonnes consumed in 1995/96. World trade in
these cereals, which amounted to 93 million tonnes in 1995/96, is expected
to fall back to 89 million tonnes. A fall in imports to South Korea has,
according to the IGC, been largely offset by rising sales to Saudi Arabia.

National grain policy.

Meanwhile a number of countries have announced changes in their national
cereals trade policies.

NETHERLANDS JOINS INTERNATIONAL PLANT VARIETY CONVENTION

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

The Dutch Government deposited its instrument of acceptance of the 1991
Act of the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of
Plants on October 14. The Geneva-based UPOV is an inter-governmental
organisation which cooperates in administrative matters with the World
Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO). It runs the International
Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants with a view to
recognising and ensuring intellectual property rights to breeders of new
plant varieties. The member states of UPOV grant such a right in
accordance with the provisions of the Convention, under their national
legislation.

The Netherlands, which is already a member state of UPOV, is the third
country to ratify the 1991 Act of the UPOV Convention. From the point of
view of international treaty law, the 1991 Act will not enter into force
for the Netherlands until one month after two additional states have
deposited instruments of adherence to the 1991 Act. But from the point of
view of national law, the Netherlands has now effectively adapted its
legislation to the 1991 Act. A number of other states also have laws which
conform with the 1991 Act and can be expected to sign up in the coming
months, UPOV said in a statement.

The 1991 Act of the Convention makes the protection of all species of
plants mandatory for member states after the expiration of a transitional
period and strengthens the protection afforded to plant breeders. It does,
however, leave protected varieties available, as at present, for use as a
source of variation for the development of other varieties. "The
strengthened protection for plant breeders will increase the incentive
provided by the Convention for plant breeding and will lessen the threat
to breeders from piracy of protected plant varieties and plagiaristic
breeding activities", according to UPOV.

The Executive Director of the International Coffee Organisation (ICO),
Celsius A. Lodder, said on October 15 that the London-based Organisation
had just received notification from the United Nations that Vietnam had
deposited its instrument of accession to the 1994 International Coffee
Agreement the day before. Vietnam exported some 3.5 million 60-kg bags of
coffee in 1996, making it the world's sixth biggest coffee exporter by
volume. Vietnam's arrival brings the ICO's membership up to 60, comprising
42 exporting and 18 importing member countries. Exporting members account
for nearly 95% of world coffee exports. Eight of these also belong to the
African coffee producers' organisation, OAMCAF (Cameroon, Central African
Republic, Congo, the Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Madagascar and
Togo).

ICO member countries as at October 16, 1996:

Exporting members: Angola, Bolivia, Brazil, Burundi, Cameroon, Central
African Republic, Colombia, Congo, Costa Rica, Cote d'Ivoire, Cuba,
Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia,
Gabon, Guatemala, Guinea, Haiti, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Jamaica,
Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mexico, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay,
Rwanda, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda, Venezuela,
Vietnam, Zaire, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

Importing members: Austria, Belgium/Luxembourg, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland,
France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway,
Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, as well as
the European Union.

3rd Asia International Coffee Conference.

One of Vietnam's first major functions as a new ICO member will be to host
the Third Asia International Coffee Conference (AICC '97), to be held in
Ho Chi Minh City from January 14 to 18, 1997. The ICO Executive Directive
will be among the key speakers, along with Vietnam's Vice-Ministers from
the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and the Ministry of
Trade. Organised under the auspices of the Vietnam National Coffee
Corporation (VINACAFE) and the Vietnam Coffee and Cocoa Association
(VICOFA) and sponsored by the ICO and Coffee Board of India, the
conference will put Vietnam's coffee industry in the spotlight and
consider whether the country will "maintain and grow in status as a major
player in the world coffee arena". In the last ten years, Vietnam has seen
phenomenal success in producing coffee, with output rising from just
467,000 bags in 1985/86 to close to 3 million bags in 1995/96. This rapid
growth, together with market expectations of a further rise in capacity
and the fact that Vietnam exports more than 80% of its production, has the
world coffee industry monitoring closely developments in the country.
Other key issues to be addressed at the conference include international
price and cost competitiveness; quality concerns and issues; international
marketing and access into the international coffee world; Arabica
production prospects for Vietnam.

CGIAR: PLANET HAS THE RESOURCES TO FEED 8 BILLION IN 2025

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

Our planet has the necessary resources to feed a world population of 8
billion in 2025, provided agricultural research is pursued and Governments
adopt appropriate policies, according to the Consultative Group on
International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). Celebrating its 25th
anniversary, CGIAR published a statement on October 27, highlighting how
an additional billion individuals have been fed since 1971 as a direct
results of its research, and underlining the need to continue funding such
research.

Established in 1971, and made up of representatives of 52 governments and
international organisations, CGIAR endeavours through agricultural
research, to contribute to guaranteeing adequate food supplies to the
populations of developing countries. The Group is financed by the World
Bank, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), and the
United Nations Development and Environment Programmes (UNDP & UNEP).

Agricultural production in 10 large developing countries has risen by 74%
since the beginning of the seventies, with the increase in yields achieved
through the introduction of new technologies accounting for 70% of this
improvement, according to CGIAR. However, official government aid to
agriculture has fallen from 2O% of total aid in 1980 to 14% in 1990.
Support programmes for international agricultural research now account for
less that 0.05% of this aid. CGIAR has an annual research budget of 300
million dollars.

CGIAR Chairman Ismail Seragedin claims "a mere increase in yields will not
be sufficient to feed the whole world in 30 years". He emphasises the
importance of "increasing the revenue of the poor, adopting appropriate
policies, and above all, ensuring that research responds to real needs".
To this end, the Group has developed specially adapted farm machinery for
small holdings which can help farmers without replacing them. Scientists
linked to CGIAR, have for example developed a mini-machine for removing
rice husks, carrying out a tedious task previously done by hand. Other
scientists have launched the micro-nutrients project, developing new
varieties of mineral-enriched cereals that may hit the markets within 6 to
10 years. CGIAR claims the diet of more than two billion people is
deficient in iron and other minerals such as zinc, with 1.2 billion
suffering from anaemia caused by these deficiencies. About 225 million
children suffer from a serious lack of vitamin A which proves fatal in 28%
of cases.

The international centre for the improvement of wheat and corn, also
linked to CGIAR, has developed six varieties of corn that prosper on acid
soil previously regarded as unfit for agriculture. Varieties of parasite
resistant crops have also been developed to reduce the use of pesticides.
Finally, CGIAR scientists have focused considerable attention on water
conservation techniques and irrigation, developing methods of collecting
water from torrential downpours and "tapping" water that condenses during
the night.

OECD: EXPORT FRUIT BOOM FROM THE SOUTH A THREAT FOR THE North?

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

There has been strong growth in global trade of temperate-climate fruit in
the past decade. Progress in preserving and transporting fresh fruit has
enabled the Southern Hemisphere countries - especially Chile, Argentina,
New Zealand and South Africa - to rapidly expand their fruit exports,
driving up world trade in apples, pears, peaches, plums, apricots, grapes
and kiwis by some 30%. Although this export boom from the South is a major
trade development of the decade, a new study from the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development, entitled "Export Fruit Boom From the
South: A Threat for the North?" foresees global trade in fresh fruit
developing differently in the years ahead:

Rising demand will stimulate an even larger volume of trade in
temperate-climate fruit, but the major source of demand growth will shift
from the OECD to the non-OECD region, predicts the report. Trade flows are
expected to shift significantly: there will be greater
internationalisation of trade, with larger numbers of exporting countries
and more varied destinations; the Northern Hemisphere will import more
from the Asian region and export less in favour of Southern Hemisphere
exporters; intra-hemisphere trade flows will also change, with intra-Asian
trade of apples increasing in the Northern Hemisphere, intra-European
trade in apples, pears, table grapes and kiwifruit expanding, and
intra-Central and South American trade also growing.

Export competition will increase for virtually all markets, meaning that
countries must hone their international competitiveness if they are to
continue to successfully market their exports: they will have to develop
astute international market strategies, improve their market research and
development, and achieve greater marketing efficiencies. At the national
level, policies that ensure safe reliable supplies and an environmentally
sound production of fresh temperate-climate fruit will become increasingly
important.

The OECD study explains this medium-term evolution of the international
market, and the likely increase in trade volumes, by:

- the general increase in consumer disposable income, especially in the
Asian region;

- shifts in consumer preferences toward a reliable year-round supply of
good quality, fresh temperate-climate fruit;

- improved marketing efficiencies and market development in exporting
countries that take advantage of non-seasonal demand;

- technical progress in sea-borne shipping and storage;

- technical progress in plant breeding and biotechnology, with shorter
growth periods, better-tasting fruit, and more varieties available to
consumers;

- greater market access, smaller volumes of subsidised exports, and more
efficient phytosanitary rules thanks to the Uruguay Round Agreement on
Agriculture;

- greater bilateral and plurilateral cooperation between countries through
regional trading arrangements and customs-free zones.

BANANA PRODUCERS' FORUM OPENS IN SANTO DOMINGO

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

The 12th Forum of Latin American banana producers opened in Santo Domingo,
capital of the Dominican Republic, on October 28, in the presence of 800
public and private sector delegates from around the world. The Forum is
intended to promote the regular development of the international banana
economy. Expobanana 96, a specialised fair for the promotion of the
product, its derivatives and associated services, was running in parallel
to the Forum.

The gathering has given Latin American and Caribbean banana growers an
opportunity to keep abreast of the latest technical progress and
plant-health developments, as well as market organisation policies
worldwide, through a programme of eight conferences and round tables
addressing specific sectors and issues. Banana-producing countries in the
region are still demanding better conditions of access to the European
Union market, regulated for the last three years by quotas and duties
which vary for Dollar zone producers (the Latin Americans) and for
African, Caribbean and Pacific signatories of the Lome Convention.

AGWEEK MAGAZINE EDIBLE BEAN MARKET COLUMN

By Ann Bailey, Agweek Magazine 
Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News 

Jan. 1--HIGHLIGHTS: The edible bean market remained in the holiday doldrums
last week, with Minnesota and North Dakota dealers quoting pinto prices of $14
per cwt. and navy prices of $15 per cwt. 

Looking ahead to the new crop, there were contracts of $18 per cwt. for navies
and $16 per cwt. for pintos available. 

DEMAND: On the demand side, the devalued peso continues to make it tough to
sell pinto beans to Mexico. In February, the country will issue permits to 
companies to buy pintos. Under NAFTA, Mexican buyers can purchase up to 1.2 
million cwt. of beans, duty-free. 

If Mexico's economic situation improves and the country is able to purchase
the beans, it would help clean up the supply of U.S. pintos on hand, 

says Tim Courneya, executive vice president of the Northarvest Bean Growers 
Association. 

With pinto and navy beans at inexpensive levels, the United States should also
continue to move out beans through the U.S. government's Food for Peace 
Program, Courneya says. However, there may be competition with green peas and 
lentils for exports because those legumes are even cheaper than navies and 
pintos. END

BEAN PRODUCTION UP, BUT SUNFLOWER CROP DIPS FOR YEAR

By Ann Bailey, Agweek Magazine 
Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News 

Jan. 1--One thing edible bean growers can pretty much count on is that the
market is cyclical: If prices are high one year, farmers are likely to plant
more beans the next year, and prices will drop. 

The cycle continued this year when U.S. farmers increased their navy bean 
production by 2.1 million cwt. to 7.3 million. Prices in the region dropped 
from $26-$27 per cwt. a year ago to $14 per cwt. this year. 

North Dakota farmers harvested 149,000 navy acres this year, up 129,000 acres
from last year when flooding and frost destroyed some acres, according to
USDA. Harvested acreage in Minnesota increased by 20,000 acres to 61,200, 
the agency says. 

N.D. navy production was 2 million cwt. this year, up from 1.5 million from a
year ago. Minnesota farmers produced 845,000 cwt. of navies, up from 678,000
last year. 

U.S. pinto bean acreage, meanwhile, dropped from last year. Farmers harvested
760,000 acres of pintos nationwide, about 70,000 fewer than last year. But in
North Dakota and Minnesota, acreage was higher than last year. Farmers
harvested 362,000 acres, a 35,000 acre increase over last year. Minnesota
farmers harvested 35,000 acres, 10,400 more than last year. 

Nationwide, U.S. pinto bean production was 11 million cwt. this year, down 1.6
million cwt. from last year. North Dakota farmers produced 4.7 million cwt. of
pintos, 424,000 cwt. more than last year, USDA says. Minnesota pinto
production increased 138,000 cwt. to 433,000. 

Pinto bean prices in the region, at about $15 per cwt. are similar to last
year. 

Adverse weather conditions hurt Northern Plains sunflower production this year.

USDA projects that North Dakota's average yields of both oil and nonoil 
sunflowers will be 1,360 pounds per acre, down 75 pounds per acre from last 
year. Total North Dakota "all sunflower" production is pegged at 2 million 
pounds, down from 2.2 million last year. 

Final figures for the year aren't available yet, but the National Sunflower
Association anticipates that North Dakota's oil yields will be lower than
USDA's projections, says Jay Hesley, marketing director of the National
Sunflower Association. 

Late planting, a shorter growing season and poor harvest conditions 
contributed to lower yields, he says. Some of this year's crop was planted a 
week to 10 days later than normal. 

In Minnesota, a wet growing sseason that spawned crop diseases reduced yields.
Hesley expects yields will be lower than the five-year average of 1,480 pounds
per acre. USDA projects average yields of both non-oil and oil sunflowers in
Minnesota to be 1,250 pounds per acre this year, down 13 pounds per acre from
last year. Total production in Minnesota is pegged at 558,750 pounds, down
41,250 pounds from last year. 

In South Dakota, USDA projects average yields of 1,380 per acre for both 
non-oil and oil sunflowers. That's a decline of 171 pounds per acre from last 
year. USDA projects total South Dakota production at 1.3 million pounds, down 
from 1.4 million last year. 

Total U.S. production of non-oil and oil sunflowers will be 4.6 million pounds,
down from 4.8 million last year, USDA projects. 

While yields are lower than last year, prices are higher. Prices are near 11
cents a pound, nearly 2 cents higher than last year. Hesley says the reason is
twofold: Farmers are reluctant sellers and buyers are trying to give farmers
an incentive to plant sunflowers this spring. Sunflowers will have to compete
with other commodities for acreage, Hesley says. END

DAKOTA FARMER'S AGRIDATA INC. CREATES FIELD INFORMATION SYSTEM

By Jayson Menke, Agweek Magazine 
Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News 

Jan. 1--David Hagert wanted to find an easier way to keep field information.
So he designed a management information system. Hagert, who farms 2,700 acres
of wheat, barley, soybeans and edible beans with his brother, Curtis Jr., near
Emerado, N.D., started working on a model in his basement in the winter of
1991, and moved to his current location at 2600 Demers Ave. in Grand Forks,
N.D, in May. 

Since going into business, AgriData Inc., has branched out into more than just
field records, it now focusus on all areas of precision farming. 

The business assists farmers with precision farming techniques by utiliziation
of an improved field recordkeeping system that integrates computer analysis,
automated data entry, mapping, field monitoring and Differential Global
Positioning Satellite technology. 

"By broadening our horizons we are able to provide customers with the lastest
equipment, software and information in one convenient location," Hagert says. 

Hagert has incorporated tillage, fertilizer, pesticide, planting, conservation
determination, weather, harvest, irrigation and soil nutrient data and maps
into two pages of information for one field for one year. 

"In the past you would have about eight pages of printed out data per field.
What we're doing is simplifying and tying everything together," Hagert says. 

Hagert's goal was to develop an easy-to-use computer system that would service
all aspects of farming. 

In the early stages of development he used speadsheets to post his farm 
records. 

His new software program, Field Facts, will be available in the mid- January. 

Farmers can purchase Field Facts from AgriData and receive training on the
software or they can gather the data and AgriData will process the information
and print it out for the farmer. 

Hagert says that precision farming endorses site specific application of crop
inputs. 

According to Hagert the goal of precision farming is to improve profits by
putting money spent on crop inputs exactly where it will do the most good. 

"The main focus is establishing patterns that are determined by yield 
monitoring equipment, satellite imagery and soil types," Hagert says. 

Hagert says the premise is that fields have varying patterns of soil types,
nutrient levels, and ultimately, varying yield levels through out a given
field. By recording and analyzing this data, crop inputs can be adjusted
through out a field to maximize yeilds and reduce total cost of inputs. 

That is, a constant rate of application over an entire field results in over
application in some spots and under application in others. By varying the
appliation rate of applications, costs can be reduced and yeilds increased. 

Hagert started keeping track of records on ACSC maps and began charting more
intensely in 1988 and designed the first prototype in 1991. 

"The main emphasis is on collecting data," Hagert says. He and his brother
used a yield monitor in 1994 and last year added a correctional signal which
enables the farmer to pinpoint spots in field through differential global
positioning system. 

"Now we can produce yield maps and look at it with satellite imagery and look
for patterns." 

AgriData will offer record keeping support, mapping, satellite imagery, 
software sales and support and consultation on hardware.

AGWEEK MAGAZINE EDITORIAL: OPENING THE DOORS

Agweek Magazine 
Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News 

A WORLD OF OPPORTUNITY AWAITS PRAIRIE AGRICULTURE Jan. 1--Whirlpool, a
leading maker of home appliances based in Benton Harbor, Mich., is one of a
number of Midwest manufacturers that has set its sights on the global market
everyone in agriculture is talking about. 

As Prairie farmers grapple with the challenges of more economically liberal
farm policy, and tackle the business world through processing and marketing
ventures, a look at Whirlpool's global adventure suggests that strategic
planning and focused energy can be bountifully rewarded. 

In its transformation from a domestic supplier into a world-class competitor,
Whirlpool evolved from a $4 billion company into an $8 billion company. In a
recent interview with Suzanne Cosgrove at Knight-Ridder Financial News,
Whirlpool CEO David Whitwam recalled that the company was devoted almost
exclusively to the U.S. marketplace in 1987 when he took his current position. 

While solidly successful, Whirlpool faced a mature environment, with only slow
natural growth -- based on population growth -- seen for the coming decade.
Whitwam concluded that the only reason it was a slow-growth industry was that
it was limited to domestic markets. 

It was time to go global. Whirlpool recognized that, while a fridge is a 
fridge is a fridge, you don't just export American-style appliances to Brazil 
and expect to reap a fortune. 

Today, Whirlpool is the No. 3 appliance supplier in Europe, and the No. 1 
supplier in both North and Latin America. 

Now it's on to Asia. Whitwam figures the Asian market will be twice the size
of U.S. market within 10 years -- as big as Europe and the United States 
combined. When asked what new language he would learn if he had time, Whitwam 
was quick to answer: "Mandarin." 

There are ample lessons for Prairie farmers in this stellar example. Stoves
aren't soybeans, but the principles of marketing and competing in new markets
are. 

The most important factor is focus, or "stick to your knitting." In other 
words, if you're selling processed flour products into the Chinese market, 
don't spin you wheels trying to sell tractor tires. 

Unlike appliances, foodstuffs are a much more fractured and diverse market. So
market research is essential. That includes building relationships that
eventually turn into deals. But where some folks look at market research as
daunting, successful ventures don't go adrift into the information sea without
a plan. 

First, know your own products, your own production potential and your own 
reserves of creativity. 

Second, have your money lined up -- nothing quite limits business 
opportunities as failing to meet contracted output quotas because you run out 
of cash. 

Third, have fun. The world market is exciting, interesting and challenging.
Prairie farmers have an unbeatable combination of a highly productive resource
base, a solid experience pool from which to draw, a lively economic
development sector, and the drive to create new business models for the next
century. 

There are those individuals who would have looked at the refrigerator market
and said, "I guess we'll have to make do with what we've got." But innovators
like Whitwam looked farther afield and saw a chance to build on their base. 

The world market wants good food. China is hungry, Russia is hungry, all of
Asia is hungry. And they're all building to a standard of living that we in
the United States saw before World War II. That means opportunity. This is the
year for Prairie farmers to look beyond their borders, to scan the global 
horizon for opportunities and to build relationships that will guarantee our 
future prosperity. 

It's time, in Whitwam's words, to learn Mandarin. EDITOR'S NOTE: Agweek

MEAT PRODUCTION SWELLED IN 1995

By Juan Miguel Pedraza, Agweek Magazine 
Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News 

Jan. 1--Livestock producers know only too well what this year's hot grain 
markets mean: fatter feed and forage costs, leaner margins. 

The rise in corn prices, which has encouraged increased oilseed meal 
production, has not triggered a major selloff. Instead, meat production 
swelled in 1995. 

There's not shortage of meat these days. In fact, from the cattleman's 
standpoint, notes a Market Watch For Beef from the National Cattlemen's 
Assocation, supplies are burdensome. 

Increased beef production has led to record U.S. per capita meat consumption,
but it hasn't been enough to turn the cattle market around from its yearlong
slump. 

NCA economists say lower retail prices continue to encourage consumption, 

but the bad news is a cyclical increase in cattle and beef production will 
keep pressure on prices. However, though prices on the hoof are still $10 to 
$20 per cwt. below levels seen in 1993 and 1994, the market this fall has 
started to rebound. 

"Fed cattle supplies tightened considerably during early fall and pushed fed
cattle prices into the upper $60 per cwt. by late November," notes James 
Mintert, a livestock economist at Kansas State University-Manhattan. Although 
cattle slaughter is expected to remain above last year's level through the end
of the year, it looks like slaughter supplies will remain tight enough through
the end of 1995 to support fed cattle prices in the mid- to upper- $60s. 

Mintert notes that breakeven prices for the last quarter of 1995 for 750- 
pound steers and 650-pound heifers are projected at $68.50 to $69.50, $2 to $4
per cwt. more than live cattle are fetching at key terminal markets such as
the Texas Panhandle. The rise in average breakeven is due almost exclusively
to this year's rapid runup in grain, oilseed meal and hay prices. Each $10 per
ton change in hay prices, Mintert says, changes feeding cost of gain by 55
cents per cwt. 

As of Nov. 30, there were 8.7 million cattle on feed in the top seven 
producing states, up from the year-ago level of 8.63 million head, and still 
ahead of the five-year Nov. 30 average of 8.64 million head. On-feed 
inventories peaked in April at 8.99 million head, according to USDA. 

The government notes its quarterly view that the number of cattle on feed in
the top 13 states as of Oct. 31 was up 2 percent from a year earlier and is
the second largest for that date since 1975. Feedlot placement in September
rose sharply before declining slightly in October, but are likely to remain
above year-ago levels. Marketings are expected to continue to remain above
year-ago levels into 1996. 

USDA estimates 1995 total U.S. beef production at 25.124 billion pounds, up
from 24.358 billion last year. 

A surge in beef exports will continue, which is a major positive influence on
U.S. beef prices. U.S. beef exports this year hit a record 1.88 billion pounds,
17 percent more than last year. 

More beef entering the domestic market would keep pushing prices down. Average
retail beef prices dropped 2 percent in 1995, according to USDA, and could
drop another 2 percent in 1996. The average retail beef price in 1995 checked
in at $2.60 per pound, with sale prices averaging $2.40 per pound. 

Most cow-calf producers this year experienced their first sizable losses since
1986, according to the National Cattlemen's Association. Most operators will
be unprofitable for another two or three years, and some will leave the 
business, the group says. END

AGWEEK MAGAZINE JUAN MIGUEL PEDRAZA COLUMN

By Juan Miguel Pedraza, Agweek Magazine 
Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News 

RURAL STATES MUST INVEST IN AG RESEARCH, MARKETING Jan. 1--When she takes
over as head of the Northern Crops Institute Jan. 15, Patricia Berglund has a
good dea what she's getting into. The North Dakota State University scientist
sees big times ahead for NCI and other research and marketing organizations in
a post-farm bill world. 

There's no doubt about it -- as governments worldwide ratchet back farm 
spending, farm income will increasingly depend on the markets. What does that 
mean exactly and where do NCI and similar organizations fit in? 

Eventually every penny you earn from every bushel you grow will come from the
price you get at the elevator. Two things come to mind: One, the elevator 
cannot be your sole source of income. Two, to make more money on what you grow,
you'll have to add value to it. On a community level, that means capturing
more of the market's dollars and retaining them at home, rather than exporting
that value to someone who'll cash it all in down the line in Minneapolis or
Chicago. 

NEW STATE OF MIND: As we shift our thinking from farm policy debates into the
real world of business and finance, the ag community must refocus its efforts
at home. That means substantially more local support for organizations like
NCI, Minnesota's Agricultural Utilization and Research Institute and Kansas
State University's international grains institute. 

Here's where the going might get rough. Though we appreciate the efforts of
policy research groups like congressionally funded Food and Agriculture Policy
Research Institute, in the real world where every dollar of profit must be
sweated from the market, their work will be increasingly marginalized. 

In other words, we're looking for real-world products and marketing ideas, not
long-range forecasts. The tough decision will come in apportioning a shrinking
pot of dollars among policy-oriented and market-oriented research facilities.
As we look to our bottom lines, the market-oriented organizations should
likely win the lion's share of that money. 

BREAD AND BUTTER PRACTICALITY: We need economists to give us some sense about
what we're doing, but the fact is over the past 50 years -- since economic
forecasting first became popular in the post-Keynesian world -- economists
have racked up a dismal record for accuracy. When you're looking to butter
your bread, you need less think-tanking about policy and a lot more practical
ideas about where the bread and butter are. 

That's great news for Berglund and NCI, and their colleagues at other 
market-oriented research and promotion organizations. But they won't get their
meal tickets without a fight. Whatever else she's got on her plate, 

Berglund and other NCI-type leaders will have to set aside a significant chunk
of time and energy to lobby local legislatures, farm groups and development
authorities to make sure that they can continue their vital work. 

After all, in a free market, everyone has to compete. And unless you can prove
you've got what it takes to make money, you're not likely to get much money. 

From our vantage point here, we see tremendous potential for NCI, for 
Agricultural Utilization and Research Institute, for the land grant colleges 
in our area, to materially contribute to the future success of the many 
agribusiness ventures that have yet to sprout. Whatever else we do with our 
money, we need to assure that Berglund and her colleagues nationwide get what 
they need to help us succeed.

PORK PRODUCERS HAVE RECORD YEAR IN '95

By Juan Miguel Pedraza, Agweek Magazine 
Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News 

Jan. 1--America's pork producers cranked out a record 17.86 billion pounds
this year, a bit more than last year's 17.7, but well below the 18.5 billion
pounds projected earlier this year. 

The numbers reflect lower market hog inventories this year, connected in part
to the rapid inflation in feed costs. Cash break-even prices are projected to
average in the low $40s per cwt. and are likely to continue rising this winter,
according to USDA economist Steve Reed. 

But despite rising grain prices, Reed says, producers are on gradually 
expanding their herds again. The number sows farrowing from September through 
next February is projected to be about the same as a year earlier. However, a 
larger pig crop is likely during this period since more pigs are being saved 
per litter. 

The good news for pork, like in beef, is exports. Record pork exports last
year had a significant impact on the industry's bottom line. 

Export sales of U.S. pork and pork variety meats in 1994 accounted foir about
6 percent of the wholesale value of total U.S. pork production, up from 5.3
percent in the early 1990s and six times what exports meant to pork industry's
bottom line a decade ago, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation. 

A USMEF-sponsored study shows that hog prices in the United States benefit
substantially from increased overseas demand for U.S. pork. Total export sales
of pork last year added $3.32 per cwt. to the value of slaughter hogs, up from
a 79-cent contribution 10 years ago. 

U.S. pork exports last year totaled a record 284,000 metric tons, or 626 
million pounds, and are expected to stay on track this year. The industry's 
growth in foreign markets is just beginning, says USMEF's Philip Seng. 

"We see potential for U.S. pork export sales of more than $1.2 billion in the
year 2001, and that's just around the corner," he says. 

That foreign demand for pork has kept hog prices steady through the 
traditional early winter market decline, according to the S.D. Pork Producers 
Council. Top market hogs sold for up to $46.75 a cwt. in Sioux Falls last week,
the highest price since October. It was more than $18 higher than the 
late-November drop in 1994 when top hogs in Sioux Falls sold for $28.50. 

"Historically, right after Thanksgiving is pretty much the seasonal low in our
markets," says Hurley farmer Steve Schmeichel, president of the South Dakota
Pork Producers Council. "The good news is that's been here and past." 

Schmeichel says an active export market and increased slaughter capacity at
packing houses helped keep pork moving at good prices. For the first time in
more than 40 years, the United States was a net exporter of pork this year. 

And pork exports should continue to increase along with the world population,
said Tom Farnsworth of Madison, executive secretary of the pork producers. 

"When you look outside the United States, pork is the meat of choice," 
Farnsworth says. "We expect our pork exports to triple in the next three to 
four years."

SOYBEAN PRICES STAGE YEAR-END RALLY

By Juan Miguel Pedraza, Agweek Magazine 
Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News 

Jan. 1--The soybean market is traditionally the most volatile of all the ag
commodities except maybe pork bellies. This year, beans were the laggards, 
with production numbers limiting the rally. 

Eventually, though, the market caught up with the reality in field: U.S. 
output was shortened by moisture, though not as badly as other crops. USDA has
estimated the U.S. 1995 soybean harvest at 2.183 billion bushels, down 13 
percent from 2.731 billion the previous year. 

That redution, not as dramatic as the plunge in corn output, set the stage for
a big year-end rally linked to drought in Brazil, the world's No. 2 soybean
exporter. The result is that farmers are feeling bullish, holding onto what
they've got and forcing the market to push bids up to pry loose available
supplies. 

Some merchants believe farmers have set a near-term goal of $7.50 a bushel for
soybeans, with handful of diehard bulls calling for double-digit dollar
figures for soybeans by spring. Soybeans have traded above $10 a bushel only
once this century, following the discovery in the 1972 to '73 season of the
Pacific Ocean current warming system known as El Nino. 

USDA economists aren't that optimistic, but they do argue that strong domestic
demand and energetic overseas buying are supporting U.S. soybean prices.
USDA's November supply-demand report pushed the average farmgate price of
soybeans for 1995 to '96 at $6.30 to $7.30 per bushel, up from $5.45 per
bushel last season and an average of $6.40 in 1993. 

The action in soybeans has pushed up prices all across the oilseed front, 
with sunflowers, safflower and canola all enjoying rallies this year. 

World vegetable oil prices continued relatively strong this year, though the
crush for meal following sharply increased feed grain prices has caused a 
short-term glut of vegoil in many markets. 

USDA says soymeal prices will average $197.50 to $222.50 per short ton (10
cents to 11 cents per pound), well ahead of year-ago levels. Still, because
the soymeal-to-corn price ratio remains favorable, and because livestock
(especially pork and poultry) output is rising, the government sees modest
growth in demand for meal. 

On the oil side, the equation is not as good largely because China, the big
buyer in 1995, has sharply curtailed purchases this year. The Chinese have
planted and harvested high-oil content crops, including soybeans, peanuts and
sunflowers and they still have stocks left over from last year's vegoil import
binge, USDA says. END

AGWEEK MAGAZINE COWBOY LOGIC COLUMN

By Ryan M. Taylor, Agweek Magazine 
Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News 

NEW YEAR'S FORTUNE: SAVINGS AND SATISFACTION AHEAD TOWNER, N.D.--Jan. 1--I
was a little worried about my financial future after tallying up my year end
pluses and minuses. The bottom of my tally sheet had a pretty sizable number
inside a pair of brackets -- brackets mean a big fat minus and denote red ink
for those of us without a color printer. 

But then I got a letter in the mail and all my financial fretting flew right
out the window. The folks at Fortune magazine were ready to lend me a hand and
extend to me the tools necessary to make 1996 a banner year for both me and my
banker. 

I had no fear that this might be a letter they'd send to just any over- 
extended rancher in Smokey Lake (N.D.) Township. The letter said, "We're 
conducting a nationwide search to attract leading business professionals and 
key decision-makers, and your name was referred to us from the Towner City 
(N.D.) area." 

Wow! All those leading business professional to choose from in the entire U.S.
of A. and little ol' me was referred by the Towner (population 669) City area!
It's not often that us Towner suburbanites in Smokey Lake Township get 
referrals from the big wigs in the Towner City area. Not for everybody 

This offer definitely wasn't for just any Jack out in the countryside. The
envelope said, "The enclosed Professional Discount Voucher is for the express
use of the person named herein and is nontransferable." 

The publisher had authorized Brian Wolfe, consumer marketing director, to give
me 74 percent off the newsstand price, send me a free guide full of 
breakthrough ideas and unconventional tactics, and guarantee my satisfaction 
because of my "status as a business professional" (in the Towner City area). 

I could see that making that kind of offer to the general public would 
probably lose fortune's for Fortune magazine. But cutting someone like myself 
in on the deal made a lot of sense. 

I'm sure their advertisers would be phoning in almost immediately and 
increasing their promotional budget with them once the big orders started 
rolling in from the Taylor Ranch. 

Brian said Fortune would help me grow my business (heavier calves and taller
grass), motivate my staff (optimistic cows and horses chomping at the bit,
ready to work), and maintain my edge (not settling to be just another broke
cattleman, but be the best damn broke cattleman there is). What the heck 

Even with the professional rate, I had second thoughts about spending any 
money on anything, what with the cattle market down in the basement and all. 
You can't fall for every smooth talking salesman whose snake oil, or magazine 
subscription, will cure all ills. 

But, then again, like Oscar Wilde said, a cynic is someone who knows the price
of everything and the value of nothing. 

So, without cynicism, the new year brings new optimism, new hope and, most
importantly, a new operating loan. A professionally discounted Fortune 
magazine subscription could be the first chip off the old 1996 borrowed 
capital block. 

Besides, I spotted the little box to check that said "Bill me later." It's a
popular option for us leading business professionals in the Towner City area.

as they applied for in the 13th Conservation Reserve Program signup. In North
Dakota, there were 395 contracts awarded, 115 fewer than than for which they
had applied. North Dakota farmers contracted 35,266 acres, 

about 7,000 fewer than for which they had applied. The average cash rental 
rate of the North Dakota contracts was $26.43 per acre, $12.07 less than the 
previous average cash rental rate per acre. Total annual cash rental payments 
in North Dakota for the 13th signup is $932,080. 

Minnesota farmers contracted 18,097 acres in the latest signup, 15,000 fewer
than for which they had applied. There were 874 contracts awarded in Minnesota,
509 fewer than for which farmers had bid. The average rental rate in Minnesota
was $68.64 per acre, $13.20 higher than the previous average cash rental rate
per acre. The total annual rental payment for the latest signup is $1.2
million. 

In South Dakota, 214 contracts were awarded, 262 fewer than for which farmers
had bid. South Dakota farmers contracted 16,539 acres in CRP, about 14,000
fewer than for which they had applied. The average rental rate per acre is
$31.96, $9.52 less than the previous average rental rate. Total annual rental
payment for the latest signup is $528,590. 

Montana farmers were awarded 446 contracts, 228 fewer than for which they had

WEATHER HAMPERED FALL POTATO HARVEST IN PARTS OF MINNESOTA, NORTH DAKOTA

Agweek Magazine 
Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News 

Jan. 1--Weather conditions varied in North Dakota and Minnesota producing 
record crops in some areas and below average crops in other areas. 

The 1995 fall potato harvest was hampered, especially in northwestern 
Minnesota and parts of North Dakota by rain and sloppy fields. The weather 
kept some growers harvesting late into the fall, while others had to abandon 
fields. 

Storage has also been a problem for growers who may have harvested late blight
infected potatoes. Those potatoes are more susceptible to diseases like soft
rot that can cause potatoes to breakdown in storage. 

Late blight was especially prevalent in irrigated potatoes. Growers will
continue to closely monitor storage bins to try to head off any problems. 

Growing conditions in North Dakota throughout the year weren't good enough to
match the record breaking yields harvested in 1994. 

Some growers blamed hot temperatures in June and too much rain in July for the
smaller yields. 

Yields averaged 210 hundredweight per acre in 1995, down from the record 235
cwt. per acre harvested in 1994. 

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, North Dakota production 
totaled 25.4 million hundred pound bags of potatoes in 1995, compared to 28.2 
million cwt. the previous year. North Dakota growers harvested 121,000 acres 
in 1995, compared to 120,000 acres the previous year. Record breaking year 

But the reverse occured in Minnesota where growers harvested record yields on
their summer and fall crops in 1995. 

Minnesota growers dug up record yields in 1995 averaging 270 cwt. per acre,
which was slightly higher than the previous record of 269 cwt. per acre set in
1994, according to USDA. Minnesota growers produced 20.8 million cwt. in 1995,
compared to 20 million cwt. the previous year. Harvested acreage in Minnesota
was pegged at 77,000 acres, up from 74,600 acres in 1994. 

Total U.S. fall and summer potato production was down in 1995 at 402 million
cwt., compared to 426 million cwt. produced in 1994. Yields averaged 334 cwt.
per acre, down from 352 cwt. per acre the previous year. 

The smaller U.S. crop has kept Red River Valley prices higher in 1995 than the
previous year. 

According to USDA's Market News, prices for No. 1 size A washed round red 
potatoes are at $8.50 to $9 per cwt., compared to $7 to $7.50 per cwt. for the
same time period time in 1994.

'SIGNIFICANT ENFORCEMENT HAMMER' IS NEEDED TO BACK UP HOUSE 
COMMITTEE FOOD ADDITIVE REPORT RECOMMENDATIONS:  McINTOSH AND 
SOUDER

The enforcement mechanisms for the recommendations in "The 
FDA Food Additive Review Process:  Backlog and Failure to 
Observe Statutory Deadline," the Government Reform and 
Oversight Committee's recent report, are inadequate, 
committee members Rep. David McIntosh (R-Ind.) and Rep. Mark 
Souder (R-Ind.) said in "additional views" printed with the 
report  (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Dec. 18, Page 41).

Both McIntosh and Souder are freshman legislators; McIntosh 
has been active in the House efforts to enact regulatory 
reform legislation and repeal the Delaney clause (See FOOD 
CHEMICAL NEWS, Nov. 20, Page 16).

"Currently, the Food and Drug Administration's delay in 
approving food additives is caused by inertia within the 
agency," McIntosh and Souder noted, adding:  "While that 
inertia can be somewhat alleviated through instructions to 
do better, I am convinced that it cannot be eliminated 
without a significant enforcement hammer.   I am 
particularly concerned that the recommendations include a 
relaxation of the statutory deadline for a decision on a 
food additive from 180 to 360 days.  While relaxing the 
statutory deadline makes some sense, it also makes sense to 
transform it into a meaningful one."

If the time frames in the report were expected to be 360 
days, then after a brief period -- 90 days perhaps  -- the 
statute should provide FDA with three options, the Indiana 
representatives said.  Those options are:  (1)  issue a 
regulation approving the use of the additive; (2) disapprove 
the use of the additive, but only if FDA can demonstrate 
that an additive has not been found to be safe; or (3) if 
FDA fails to do either, the additive is deemed to be 
approved.

"In this way, FDA is provided with an incentive to engage in 
a real cost/benefit analysis in the allocation of its 
resources," they added, noting:  "... unless hammers such as 
this one are incorporated into the regulatory schemes we 
have developed, we are destined to see agencies fail to meet 
statutory deadlines and justify their failures with claims 
of too much work and too few resources."

Six Report Recommendations Include Elimination of Pending 
Petitions' Backlog within One Year

The report's six recommendations were:  

-- Congress should amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act review period for food additive petitions from 180 to 
360 days for the most scientifically complex reviews, and 
the deadline should be strictly observed by FDA;  

FDA should recognize that the approval of useful and safe 
new products can be as important to the public health as 
preventing the marketing of harmful or ineffective products; 

FDA should eliminate the backlog of pending food additive 
petitions within one year by reallocating the necessary 
agency resources; 

FDA should utilize outside expertise in its evaluation of 
food additive petitions but retain authority for petition 
approval; 

the relevance of the Delaney clause should be studied in 
view of modern scientific standards so that better 
distinctions can be made between nominal hazards and actual 
risks, and 

FDA should amend the review process to prohibit anonymous 
submission of data or comments.  ((6FCN 4602, 14 pages, $8)

WEBB TECHNICAL GROUP TAKES FSIS CONTRACT DISPUTE TO SEN. 
HELMS 

Raleigh-based Webb Technical Group, Inc. urged North 
Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms (R) to step in and prevent the 
Food Safety and Inspection Service from cancelling a meat 
and poultry analysis contract (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Aug. 
28, Page 26).  

The firm alleges that FSIS made the decision without 
conducting the necessary cost-benefit analysis.

Webb said the contract cancellation would result in the loss 
of 17 jobs, waste hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars, 
and threaten meat and poultry safety.  


"It has been suggested that the real savings planned by FSIS 
is to eliminate this work, which would further violate the 
intent of Congress to assure a safe and wholesome food 
supply for U.S. consumers," Board Chairman Neil Webb said in 
a recent letter to Helms.

"Either FSIS has a hidden agenda, or they just don't know 
what they are doing," Webb stated.  "Either way, we would 
appreciate some help in getting to the bottom of this."

According to the firm, Webb has conducted residue and 
compositional testing for FSIS for the past 13 years -- 
specifically, monitoring the meat supply for economic fraud 
and verifying the safety of domestic and imported meat 
products.  On July 25, 1995, Webb was advised that FSIS 
would not renew the contract "due to change in the program 
requirements."  Webb said it found out that FSIS had planned 
to analyze all meat and poultry food chemistry samples in 
its Technical Services laboratories beginning next fiscal 
year.

Webb said the government never proved that such a decision 
would be fiscally sound.  In October, FSIS responded that it 
had not violated procurement regulations when it dropped the 
contract, and that FSIS would be using new technology and 
upgrading equipment at its own laboratories to increase 
efficiency.  Webb argued that USDA guidelines barred the 
North Carolina firm from using new alternate technologies. 

Webb asked for a meeting with Helms' staff on the issue, and 
asked the senator to contact USDA Secretary Dan Glickman "to 
get to the bottom of the situation."  ((6FCN 4604, 19 pages,

USDA 'WHOLESOMENESS' SEAL SHOULD BE DROPPED, WARNING LABEL 
ADDED TO CURED MEATS, GROUPS SAY IN PETITION TO FSIS

Jeremy Rifkin's Foundation on Economic Trends and the 
Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine have filed a 
petition with USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service 
seeking removal of the "wholesomeness" seal, stronger 
language on safe handling labels and a warning label on 
cured meat products.

USDA received the petition Oct. 26 but did not place it on 
file in the hearing clerk's office until recently.  The 
groups had been considering suing USDA to stop use of the 
"wholesomeness" seal; the petition cites legal precedents 
and the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) as the basis for 
the groups' claims (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, July 31, Page 
2).

The petition, written by FET's Theodore Waugh and the 
Physicians Committee's Andrew Nicholson, cites the risk to 
consumers from E. coli O157:H7 as the basis for the groups' 
requests.  "The risk of serious permanent physical injury 
and death, USDA's inability to safeguard the meat supply and 
the lack of medical preparedness indicate both the 
seriousness and extent of the E. coli problem," the petition 
said, adding, "Until effective control measures are 
developed to eliminate E. coli contamination, USDA needs to 
take further actions to protect consumers and conform with 
its statutory obligations."

The petitioners misstated the scope of USDA's declaration 
that E. coli O157:H7 was an adulterant.  The USDA 
declaration applied only to raw ground beef; the petition 
said that "USDA has determined that E. coli-contaminated 
meats are 'adulterated.'"

The petition quoted the FMIA as saying, "It is essential in 
the public interest that the health and welfare of consumers 
be protected by assuring that meat and meat food products 
distributed to them are wholesome, not adulterated ... 
Unwholesome, adulterated and/or misbranded meat and meat 
food products ... result in ... injury to consumers."

"Thus, according to USDA's own regulations, only meats 
lacking E. coli contamination can be labeled 'Inspected and 
Passed,'" the petition said, adding, "Because the FMIA 
prohibits misleading and false labeling, the USDA must 
remove the 'Inspected and Passed' labels from meat products 
until it can conclusively determine that the meat is 
uncontaminated with the adulterant E. coli."

Nicholson and Waugh said that USDA's baseline survey of 
steers and heifers found that "approximately 15% of all raw 
beef samples contain one or more species of pathogens " (See 
FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Feb. 7, 1994, Page 60).  They also cited 
a Sept. 22 ABC News "20/20" show that quoted "USDA doctors" 
as saying that "probably one out of every thousand 
hamburgers contains E. coli bacteria."

The petition also said that USDA has admitted its sampling 
program for E. coli O157:H7 in raw ground beef "cannot 
eliminate E. coli from the food supply."

Safe Handling Labels Inadequate, Cured Meats Should Have 
Warning Labels, Groups Say

"It is clear the number of outbreaks has remained high or 
continued to grow even with USDA's safe care and handling 
labels," the groups said, adding, "In light of the 
continuing number of E. coli outbreaks, it is necessary for 
USDA to improve the current safe handling labels."  The 
labels should state the consequences of undercooking, the 
petition said, explaining:

"How can consumers adapt their behavior to meet the 
seriousness of the health risk when they are uninformed of 
the potential consequences?  For all a purchaser knows, the 
only illness resulting from contamination is an upset 
stomach.  If individuals knew that kidney failure and death 
were potential side effects, they would take the warnings 
with the degree of seriousness that the hazard requires."

The petitioners recommended a new safe handling label that 
would begin:  "WARNING: This product may contain E. coli 
bacteria, which can cause serious illness, including:  
death, strokes, seizures, bloody diarrhea, renal failure, 

red blood cell destruction."  Anyone suffering from 
abdominal cramps or diarrhea a few days after consumption 
should consult a physician immediately, the label would 
recommend, as well as stating that the product should be 
cooked until no red color remains, to a minimum temperature 
of 155 F.  

The labels should be bigger and in larger type than the 
current ones, the petitioners said.

They called for a similar warning for cured meat products, 
noting that "it has become clear that E. coli contamination 
can survive the curing process. ... In light of this 
potential danger, USDA should warn consumers of cured meat's 
potential dangers, and at the very least, the agency must 
remove the 'Inspected and Passed' labels from cured meat 
products until it can be certain that the meat is not 
adulterated with E. coli."

"If USDA ignores this request, the agency will have acted in 
an arbitrary and capricious manner in violation of the 
Administrative Procedures Act," the petitioners said.

MOLD CONTENT OF SEVERAL TYPES OF COMMERCIAL POPCORN 
DETERMINED

Noting a general lack of information on molds in popcorn, 
researchers undertook a study of the mold content of popcorn 
in commercial channels, reporting their findings in the 
September 1995 issue of the Journal of Food Protection.

Sarath Katta and colleagues, University of Nebraska, 
Lincoln, Nebr., determined the internal mold infection 
levels of various microwave and nonmicrowave popcorn by 
direct plating of kernels on Dichloran-rose bengal-
chloramphenicol agar (DRBC), Dichloran-18% glycerol agar 
(DG-18), Aspergillus flavus/parasiciticus agar (AFPA) and 
Czapek's iprodione agar (CZID).

The total percentage of mold-infected kernels was low in 
microwave yellow popcorn (5.9%) and nonmicrowave yellow 
popcorn (7.3%), but somewhat higher in specialty popcorn 
(13.6%) and nonmicrowave white popcorn (15.1%), according to 
the report.

Of the molds found, Fusarium species predominated in the 
microwave yellow popcorn (54.2%) and nonmicrowave white 
popcorn (66.2%), whereas Aspergillus species predominated in 
the nonmicrowave yellow popcorn (43.8%) and specialty popcorn 
(52.9%).  Negligible amounts of Aspergillus flavus-
parasiticus molds were found in the samples evaluated.

No significant differences were found among media in 
enumerating total mold infection levels.  DG-18 was 
effective in enumerating Aspergillus species, but 
ineffective for Fusarium species, the researchers reported.  
They recommended that either AFPA or CZID be used to 
determine the total percentage of mold infection levels in 
popcorn.

Effects of Storage Conditions on Popcorn Mold Content 
Assessed

Also in the same issue, Katta and Lloyd Bullerman, also of 
the University of Nebraska, reported their findings on a 
study of the effects of high temperature and relative 
humidity, as well as packaging, on the mold content and 
quality of stored popcorn.

White and yellow popcorn were stored in different containers 
at high temperature (35 C) and high relative humidity (85%) 
for three months.  Gradual decreases in popping volumes with 
the lengthening of storage time were observed in both white 
and yellow popcorn, the researchers reported.

Few differences were found in total infection levels up to 
60 days of storage, except that the Aspergillus glaucus 
group became established in place of field fungi.  A gradual 
increase in mold infection levels was then observed during 
the remaining 30 days of storage.  Visible mold growth was 
also observed on the tops of some kernels by the end of 
storage studies, according to the report.

Internal mold infection in white popcorn stored in an open 
container was lower (18.3%) than in white popcorn stored in a 
closed plastic bag (75%) and closed plastic jar (85.3%), 
whereas the internal mold infection in yellow popcorn stored 
in an open container was higher (23.3%) than in yellow 
popcorn stored in a closed plastic bag (6.3%) and closed 
plastic jar (2.6%), the report stated.

Mycoflora of Various Cereal Flakes Determined

German researchers examined 12 brands of cereal flakes for 
their qualitative and quantitative mold contamination, 
reporting their findings in the July 1995 issue of the same 
journal.

M. Weidenborner and B. Kunz, of the Universitat Bonn, in 
Bonn, Germany, reported higher fungal counts in two wheat 
and one oat flake samples, while the remaining brands showed 
minor contamination rates.

The fungal flora consisted of 64 different species belonging 
to 23 fungal genera, with fungi of the Eurotium, Aspergillus 
and Penicillium predominant in most samples, according to the 
report.

To obtain a comprehensive evaluation, the mycoflora of 
foodstuffs should be investigated on at least three 
different media, the researchers concluded.

Simplified Method for Aflatoxin Extraction From Peanuts 
Reported

Also in the same issue, researchers reported a simplified 
method for extraction of aflatoxin from peanut meal and 
kernels by CO2-methanol, using a highly pressurized fluid 
extraction process.

Pei-Yin Wu, Da Yeh Institute of Technology, Changhwa, 
Taiwan, and Robin Chiou, National Chiayi Institute of 
Agriculture, Chiayi, Taiwan, used peanut kernels infected 
with Aspergillus parasiticus after milling into meals as a 
naturally contaminated material for investigating the 
efficacy of supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) as a 
technique for removing aflatoxin.  Methanol solutions (60% 
and 100%) were used to modify the properties of the 
extraction media, and extraction parameters such as 
pressure, methanol concentration, methanol/peanut meal ratio 
and holding time were extensively investigated.

Results using this technique were comparable to those 
obtained using a commercialized immunochemical method, 
according to the report.

FDA PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION 
DESCRIBED IN POLICY STATEMENT

In response to inquiries concerning its use of confidential 
information in rulemaking, the Food and Drug Administration 

Dec. 27 published a "Statement of Procedures for Handling 
Confidential Information in Rulemaking."  

The cigarette and smokeless tobacco companies questioned FDA 
policy following the agency's August 1995 publication of a 
proposed rule concerning regulation of nicotine-containing 
cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products.  Noting that the 
statement was developed to address this industry's specific 
concerns, the agency said the procedures described reflect 
docket management procedures "long used" by FDA in 
rulemaking.    

According to the statement, FDA does not make available 
trade secret information, confidential commercial 
information or other information "whose disclosure would 
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy."  In 
addition, no information that would "reveal the identity of 
confidential sources" would be placed into a public docket, 
the agency noted.  

While trying to assure that "clearly proprietary 
information" is not "unwittingly made available," FDA 
advised that information submitted to a public docket does 
not carry a "reasonable expectation of confidentiality."  
The agency contends it is under "no legal obligation" to 
closely examine submitted documents to determine whether 
they "may contain proprietary information."  

FDA is aware, however, of the "sensitivity and importance" 
of such information, and has "long followed" certain 
procedures to try to ensure that "clearly proprietary 
information" is not made available, the agency said, noting 
that it scans documents for "obvious trade secrets or 
personal privacy information."  

According to the statement, information marked "confidential" 
is referred to the appropriate center's Freedom of Information 
Act officers, FDA added, for a determination as to whether it 
will be exempt under the act from public disclosure.  Before 
any documents containing such "confidential" information are 
placed on public record, the appropriate center consults with 
the person(s) who submitted the documents as to whether it was 
intended that the document be made available to the public, 
the agency said.

NCTR SCIENCE BOARD TO MEET  FOR SITE VISIT REPORT, RESOURCE 
DISCUSSIONS 

The Food and Drug Administration announced Dec. 29, 1995 
that a meeting of the Science Advisory Board to the National 
Center for Toxicological Research will be held Jan. 29 and 
Jan. 30 at NCTR in Jefferson, Ark.  

At the meeting, the board will be given a progress report on a 
recommendation resulting from its Site Visit Team Report on 
NCTR's Analytical Methods Development program.  In addition, a 
presentation will be made and the board will be asked to 
review the center's integration of the eight programs the 
board has visited.  According to the FDA notice, the 
presentation will include a discussion of the resources 
allocated to these programs, as well as their relation to 
NCTR's strategic vision and goals.  

The closed portion of the board's meeting will focus on 
"personal information" concerning individuals involved with 
NCTR's research programs, disclosure of which would 
constitute a "clearly unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy," FDA noted.  For additional information, contact 
Ronald Coene, NCTR, 301-443-3155.

HEN STRAIN AFFECTS HOW DIET CHANGES LIPIDS IN POULTRY 
PRODUCTS

Fatty acid metabolism may vary between strains of laying 
hens, according to researchers, who observed differences in 
how several strains incorporated a specific polyunsaturated 
acid from their diets.  But the differences were relatively 
small, and in general, PUFA in the diet produced marked 
increases in PUFA in the eggs and meat of the birds, 
according to the researchers' report in the October 1995 
issue of the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry.

Geetha Cherian and colleagues, University of Alberta, 
Edmonton, Canada, studied the effects of feeding diets high 
or low in alpha-linolenic acid on the lipid and fatty acid 
composition of the liver and subdermal fat or on products 
such as eggs, white meat and dark meat of six different 
strains of laying hens.

The researchers noted that increasing the polyunsaturated to 
saturated fatty acid ratio of egg yolk or tissue lipids would 
make poultry products more acceptable to health-conscious 
consumers.

Natural Antioxidants as Vegetable Oil Preservatives 
Investigated

Also in the same issue, Spanish researchers reported on 
their investigation into how some naturally formed oxidized 
lipid/amino acid reaction products are able to protect bulk 
vegetable oils against oxidation.

Manuel Alaiz and colleagues, Instituto de la Grasa, CSIC, 
Seville, Spain, undertook a study to determine if the reaction 
products are able to stop or slow a peroxidative process 
initiated in a vegetable oil.

Their findings suggest that some of the reaction products 
might be playing an antioxidative role in foods by delaying 
the peroxidative process at the same time that they are 
being produced, according to the report.  The researchers 
noted that special attention has been given to natural 
antioxidants in recent years because of the possible, but 
not yet proven, hazardous effects of synthetic antioxidants.

Stability of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Egg Powder 
Assessed

High spray-drying temperatures led to a higher loss of many 
polyunsaturated fatty acids in egg powder, according to a 
report in the August 1995 issue of the same journal.

Francesc Guardiola and colleagues, University of Barcelona 
and CSIC, Barcelona, Spain, studied the influence of 
different factors, including spray-drying temperature, kind 
of antioxidant, antioxidant concentration and packing 
conditions on PUFA losses in egg powder stored for 10 
months.

Storage of egg powder under vacuum away from light 
effectively prevents the loss of many PUFA, according to the 
researchers, who also reported that antioxidants may be 
slightly effective in preventing PUFA losses under highly 
oxidative conditions.

The researchers recommended that spray-dried egg yolk not be 
used as a long-chain PUFA source for enriching weaning 
foods, since oxidized fatty acids "lose their essentiality 
and present several harmful biological effects."

Hydrolysis Seen as Major Cause of Deterioration in Frozen 
Trout

Also in the same issue, Swedish researchers reported that 
hydrolysis is the major cause of lipid deterioration in 
frozen farmed rainbow trout fillets.

Torbjorn Ingemansson and colleagues, SIK-The Swedish 
Institute for Food Research, Goteborg, and Karlshamns 
LipidTeknik, Stockholm, Sweden, studied the extent of lipid 
hydrolysis and oxidation in the muscle tissue of frozen 
rainbow trout to elucidate the effects of acclimatization 
temperature and storage time on these mechanisms, using 
multivariate statistical methods.

Lower water temperature during acclimatization (5 C rather 
than 12 C) resulted in reduced lipid stability during frozen 
storage, according to the report.

ACSH WANTS DELANEY REPLACED WITH FLEXIBL  NEW REGULATORY 
PROCESS

The American Council on Science and Health called on 
Congress to repeal the Delaney clause, so that regulatory 
agencies would be free to balance risks against benefits and 
use a more appropriate weight of evidence test in regulating 
food additive risks.

In a new booklet, "Modernize Our Food Safety Laws:  Delete 
the Delaney Clause," ACSH argued that the zero-risk standard 
has been a "scientifically indefensible double standard," 
and that public interest groups who support the measure 
would "lose power" if the measure were repealed.

"Strict enforcement will endanger the food supply, raising 
prices and making it even harder for Americans to consume 
the very fruits and vegetables that have been linked to 
reduced cancer rates and improved health," warned Elizabeth 
Whelan, president of ACSH.

The New York City-based group said a replacement to the 
Delaney clause should provide a flexible regulatory process, 
not a specific standard.  As part of the new process, tumors 
or cancers should not be the sole or even primary regulatory 
concern, ACSH said, explaining:  "Regulators should consider 
a broad range of possible health risks, including cancer."

It may be necessary to legislate that regulators cannot use 
worst-case assumptions in calculating risk except under 
extraordinary circumstances, the group said.  "By piling 
worst-case assumption upon worst-case assumption, regulators 
easily can overestimate risks by multiples of millions," the 
report said.

Regulators should take into account negative and "no effect" 
test results as well as positive results, the report 
recommended, noting that current law only allows regulators 
to consider the positive development of tumors.


Each substance should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, 
and human exposure and epidemiology should be taken into 
account, it added.  "A substance that is toxic to some 
animals is not necessarily toxic to humans, and vice versa," 
the report said.

Such an approach would be far from perfect, the group 
acknowledged, adding:  "But it would come much closer to 
scientific honesty and prioritization of risks than what we 
have now or would be likely to get from any bright-line 
approach."

The report also reviews past applications of the Delaney 
clause, the Environmental Protection Agency's reform 
efforts, "mouse terrorism," and the politics of Delaney 
repeal.  The group rejected the latest attempt to override 
Delaney with an amendment by Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) 
to S 343, which was one of the regulatory reform measures.  

"It leaves in place the Delaney clause and does not directly 
amend it, perhaps inviting litigation," ACSH said.  Also, 
the group said the amendment would have set a new standard 
for barring products on account of risk, regardless of its 
benefits.

CSPI RAISES NEW ISSUES WITH OLESTRA FOOD ADDITIVE PETITION

The Center for Science in the Public Interest Jan. 2 
alerted the Food and Drug Administration to new research 
showing beta-carotene's cancer-fighting ability and to the 
new Dietary Guidelines for Americans' recommendations as 
reasons to deny the olestra food additive petition.

CSPI said the latest study by Harinder Garewal of the 
Veterans Administration Medical Center in Tucson involved 
giving 50 patients a daily dose of 60 mg of beta-carotene 
for six months.  Unpublished results found 26 (52%) patients 
responded to beta-carotene, with their oral leukoplakia 
diminishing, CSPI reported. 

"The result is similar to that found in an earlier study by 
Garewal that used half as much beta-carotene," CSPI 
Executive Director Michael Jacobson said.  Garewal said his 
subjects were not deficient in vitamin A.

According to CSPI, intervention trials have demonstrated 
that beta-carotenoid causes regression of oral leukoplakia, 
which is believed to be a precursor of oral cancer.  FDA has 
stated that a critical issue regarding olestra is whether 
carotenoids, blood levels of which are depleted by olestra, 
serve any biological purpose in humans other than beta-
carotene's role as a provitamin A.

CSPI's Jacobson also took the opportunity to point to the 
newly released Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which 
emphasize the importance of carotenoids as cancer-fighters, 
as inconsistent with FDA's action in considering an additive 
that would reduce carotenoid absorption from foods.

Dietary Guidelines Special Mention Of Beta-Carotene Cited

A sister agency in the Department of Health and Human 
Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture deemed 
carotenoids of such importance that a special box lists 
"Some Good Sources of Carotenoids," Jacobson said.

"With that level of recognition that carotenoids appear to 
offer health benefits, it would be extra ironic if the FDA 
approves carotenoid-depleting olestra just weeks after 
release of the new federal nutrition policy," Jacobson told 
FDA.  The agency is expected to issue a regulation on 
olestra in the next month  

Meanwhile, CSPI submitted lengthy comments to the olestra 
petition Dec. 21 after the group convinced the agency to 
extend the comment deadline (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Dec. 
18, Page 13).  

CSPI had asked for the deadline extension based on two new 
studies:  a study on water content of stools, and a large 
home-use study of olestra snacks.  CFSAN was aware of the 
home-use study but chose to ignore it, said FDA Deputy 
Commissioner for Policy William Schultz in a Dec. 8 letter.  
But the agency agreed to permit CSPI to submit comments on 
the newly available stool water content data.  

CSPI filed its comments focusing on olestra's depletion of 
carotenoids and gastrointestinal disturbances after 
reviewing the transcript of the November Food Advisory 
Committee meeting.

Failure to Give Advisory Committee Full Review of Carotenoid 
Data Hit

CSPI argued that the views of Procter & Gamble and "its few 
hired experts on carotenoids" were not consistent with 
experts "who share our concerns about the likely adverse 
impact on health of depletion of carotenoids, and experts 
who have expressed their concern about the likely adverse 
impact on public health of allowing olestra onto the 
market."

The advocacy group reiterated charges that CFSAN staff had 
failed to provide the working group and Food Advisory 
Committee with data needed for an informed decision on 
carotenoid's role in health protection.

"We disagree strongly with the CFSAN staff's decision not to 
provide committee members and the Commissioner with a full 
review of data on carotenoids, since several members of the 
working group and Food Advisory Committee stated that they 
found the question of carotenoids to be the most difficult 
one they faced, and all data bearing on the health effects 
of carotenoids should have been provided to the panels."  
The group added, "We trust that the in vitro, animal, 
clinical, epidemiological, and intervention-trial data will 
be reviewed by the Commissioner when he is considering what 
action he will take regarding olestra." 

CSPI also suggested that CFSAN staff not carry out the 
review, "given that staff's inadequate treatment of those 
important research data."

The group found CFSAN's report on olestra "completely 
ignored a large and growing body" of research on the role of 
carotenoids in protecting health.  Included was a study 
appearing in the Dec. 6, 1995, issue of the Journal of the 
National Cancer Institute on the link to consuming lycopene-
rich tomato products and the reduced risk of prostate cancer 
(See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Dec. 11, Page 10).

"While that study did not prove that lycopene protects 
against prostate cancer, the findings are very important in 
evaluating olestra, because lycopene is the most lipophilic 
carotenoid and the carotenoid most severely depleted by 
olestra and by the sucrose polyester used in the recent 
Dutch study," CSPI commented, adding:  "Since lycopene is 
abundant in tomatoes, it is of obvious concern that savory 
snacks containing olestra may well be eaten with tomato-
containing meals."

CSPI reiterated charges that carotenoid levels are likely to 
be reduced significantly by olestra, despite claims by 
Procter & Gamble, and that between-meal consumption of 
olestra would have some impact on carotenoids.

On the issue of gastrointestinal disturbances, CSPI charged 
members of a working group on olestra and the Food Advisory 
Committee with defining "out of existence the diarrhea 
caused by olestra."  The comments added, "There was very 
little discussion of the numerous other gastrointestinal 
disturbances associated with consumption of olestra, and, 
since diarrhea was likely the most serious of the symptoms, 
by concluding that olestra did not cause diarrhea, it then 
became fairly simple for the panels to reach a conclusion of 
'no harm.'"

The group concluded that FDA should deny the olestra 
petition because evidence suggests that "depletion of 
carotenoids presents a clear risk of harm to public health, 
and there is absolutely no way that a conclusion can be 
drawn that there would be a 'reasonable certainty of no 
harm' if carotenoid absorption was reduced by olestra."

CSPI also took aim at the legal burden of proof that the 
group said has been inappropriately switched to government 
authorities who must prove olestra is harmful.  "Those 
people heard the evidence demonstrating that olestra reduces 
serum levels of carotenoids and the evidence that 
carotenoids reduce risks of cancer, heart disease and 
macular degeneration, yet because there was not proof that 
carotenoids are beneficial, many of them said that olestra 
is safe." 

According to the group, the lucky consumers will be those 
who experience gastrointestinal problems once olestra foods 
become available and stop eating such foods, so "their 
carotenoid intake would no longer be threatened."




Procter & Gamble Questions APHA Olestra Review

On a related note, Procter & Gamble criticized the American 
Public Health Association's conclusions on the pending 
olestra petition (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Dec. 4, Page 19) in 
a Nov. 28 letter to APHA Executive Director Fernando Trevino.  
"Quite frankly, the November 14 letter from APHA was a 
surprise to us, and it is unfortunate that APHA has taken a 
position on olestra's use in snack foods without a full 
appreciation of the data," the petitioner said.

The company said APHA seemed to have little interest in 
olestra before P&G had an opportunity to provide a "cursory 
one-hour overview" of the olestra research program to an 
APHA health protection analyst.  "A one-hour overview is not 
a sufficient basis on which to judge the more than 150,000 
pages of research data that comprise the olestra food 
additive petition," the firm said.  

Comprehensive clinical testing answered key concerns about 
the long-term public health impact of olestra snack foods, 
said the firm, including confirmed safety in people who are 
more likely to eat lower fat foods than the average person 
and safety in people with gastrointestinal diseases.  Procter 
& Gamble responded to APHA's concerns in the 13-page letter.

Procter & Gamble's Christopher Hassall offered to meet with 
APHA to review the research in detail. ((6FCN 4603, 103

CONSUMER COMMENTS OPPOSING APPROVAL  FLOOD OLESTRA FILE

More than 700 comments have filled the olestra file at FDA's 
dockets management branch, the vast majority from consumers 
urging the agency not to approve the fat substitute.

While many of the comments were form letters inspired by the 
Center for Science in the Public Interest's campaign to keep 
olestra out of the food supply (See preceding story), others 
were generated by press reports of the four-day FDA Food 
Advisory  Committee meeting in November held by FDA to 
consider the data on olestra (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS,  Nov. 
20, Pages 17 and 31, and Nov. 27, Page 3).  The comment 
period on the petition ended Dec. 21.

A letter from Terry and Joanie Davis of Eagan, Minn., for 
example, cited a wire service story of the meeting, asking 
FDA, "Why allow the sale of a food product that will 
increase the likelihood of sickness for some and increase 
health care costs for all?"

They noted that a suggested warning label should be required 
to be printed "in no less than 10 point font for the sight 
impaired," but added, "Unfortunately, this won't help the 
unsuspecting guest eater at restaurants or picnics unless 
the server has a conscience and remembers to warn them."

Phytochemical Investigator Urges Denial of Petition

A researcher investigating the anti-cancer potential of 
phytochemicals warned FDA not to approve the pending food 
additive petition for olestra, predicting that use of the 
product may have a negative health impact.

Jed Fahey, faculty research associate with the Brassica 
Chemoprotection Laboratory at the Johns Hopkins School of 
Medicine, said he was "distressed" by the data indicating 
that olestra may reduce absorption of many fat-soluble 
vitamins.  "There are a great number of other, fat-soluble 
phytochemicals, some of which we are investigating in my 
laboratory for their anti-cancer potential," Fahey said, 
adding, "Many of them have yet to even be isolated in pure 
form and are therefore unavailable for testing."

"The inclusion of olestra in commonly consumed American 
foods has a high probability of effecting the wholesale 
reduction of a multiplicity of beneficial compounds from the 
diet of a great many Americans," the letter to FDA 
Commissioner Dr. David Kessler said, adding, "Based on 
overwhelming epidemiological evidence, there is a high 
probability that the use of this product would have a 
negative health impact."

Comments from the American Diabetes Association and the 
American Heart Association took no specific stand on whether 
FDA should approve olestra.  ADA said it supports the 
development and introduction into the marketplace of food 
products that help people lose or maintain weight, but added 
that it "looks to and respects the FDA review process for 
assurance of product safety."  AHA encouraged FDA to 
continue the review of all fat replacers.  The group noted 
that many products on the market labeled as "reduced fat" 
have significant amounts of mono- and diglycerides, which 
are a source of calories and are metabolized as fat.

Comments Commend Conduct of Advisory Committee Meeting

The comments of a variety of researchers supporting approval 
of the fat substitute -- some of which were sent in by 
Procter & Gamble, the petition's sponsor --  were also 
included in the FDA administrative file on olestra.  Many of 
these letters included positive comments about the conduct 
of the four-day Food Advisory Committee meeting.

The American Dietetic Association said one of its 
representatives attended the advisory committee and working 
group meetings on olestra, adding, "We believe that the 
process allowed for a full airing of ADA's views on this 
matter.  We fully support the FAC review process, including 
its interpretation of the data and consideration of public 
comment."

A co-discoverer of olestra, Dr. Fred Mattson, professor of 
medicine emeritus at the University of California in San 
Diego, noted that as early work on the compound progressed, 
"I came to the conclusion that olestra posed no hazard as a 
food ingredient."

"Subsequent studies have served to strengthen this opinion," 
Mattson said.  He noted that olestra "is now supported by a 
much wider range of studies, and now many of these are on 
human subjects.  Moreover, the level of use is inherently 
limited by the nature of the food products in which it will 
be used."

Nutritionist Johanna Dwyer of Tufts University said her 
interest in fat substitutes such as olestra led her to 
independently review some of the studies in the peer-
reviewed literature.  Later, she was asked by P&G to review 
and edit two papers for publication on consumption models 
and use of the pig and other data for assessing human 
effects of consuming olestra.  Noting a specific interest in 
gastrointestinal effects, Dwyer said she requested and 
received additional information on GI effects, and devoted 
particular attention to what might be expected at very high 
levels of intake.

At Dwyer's request, P&G sent her blinded samples of olestra-
containing potato chips and regular potato chips in amounts 
that would constitute the 95th percentile of intake.  Dwyer 
said she ate these potato chips in a single bolus amount for 
a meal on two separate days and subsequently recorded her 
own views of signs and symptoms of GI distress.  "I felt 
more GI distress when eating the regular potato chips, and 
did not record any differences in stool consistency in this 
brief experiment," Dwyer wrote.  She noted that very high 
chronic use might produce changes in the consistency of the 
stool, but it is "inappropriate to describe these changes as 
diarrhea."

Dwyer said she concluded that the product "is safe and may 
provide a benefit to some consumers who wish to eat low fat, 
low saturated fat salty snacks."  She added that the FDA 
evaluation process and the advisory committee deliberations 
"were reasonable, thorough and helpful."

Dr. Harry Greene, clinical professor of pediatrics at 
Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said he attended the 
advisory committee meeting in November and was "extremely 
impressed with the presentations by the FDA scientists and 
the presentations by the expert consultants brought in by 
FDA in providing an unbiased and scientific approach to the 
relevant studies which have been performed with olestra."

CSPI Took Data Out of Context, Researcher Charges

Greene criticized presentations by the Center for Science in 
the Public Interest, saying much of the data "was taken out 
of context" or "completely misinterpreted due to a lack of 
scientifically acceptable statistical evaluation, and in 
many instances was anecdotal."  In contrast, he said, "the 
data presented by Procter & Gamble scientists represented 
clear examples of well controlled, scientifically credible 
studies."

Greene said the chairman of the advisory committee made sure 
that CSPI had an equal opportunity to present its 
objections.

Also charging that CSPI took data out of context, Dr. 
Michael Davidson, medical director of the Chicago Center for 
Clinical Research at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical 
Center, noted that the clinical studies by P&G "were 
purposely designed to assess the extreme intakes of olestra 
in subjects of various body sizes and dietary habits."  
Davidson pointed out that olestra "was used to replace 
almost 50% of the daily fat intake for those in the 32-gram 
dose group," which he said "included petite young women who 
were unaccustomed to large intake of non-digestible food."

"The vast majority of subjects with gastrointestinal events 
were women who would rarely consume 32 grams of olestra on 
a single day, yet were fed 32 grams daily for eight weeks," 
Davidson added.  He noted that approval of olestra "has 
significant health implications for the entire U.S. 
population," since high fat consumption is a leading cause 
of heart disease, diabetes, cancer and obesity.

Researcher Reports Positive Response to Olestra in 
Nutrition Education Study

Dr. John Foreyt of the Baylor College of Medicine in 
Houston said he conducted a study on the use of olestra in 
a nutrition education program.  Female adults were randomly 
assigned to either an olestra or non-olestra group, and 
various food products containing olestra, including 
shortening, potato chips, oven-ready french fries, and a 
mayonnaise-type salad, were made available as part of an 
overall nutrition education program, Foreyt said.  
"Response to the product was positive," he commented, 
noting that subjects in both groups reduced their dietary 
fat consumption to approximately 30% of total calories.

 "Responses to our questionnaire suggested that subjects 
with access to the olestra products experienced less 
deprivation while reducing dietary fat intake than the 
subjects without access to the olestra products," Foreyt 
said, adding that the study is currently in press.

 "Based on our study, and my reading of the olestra 
research, I believe that olestra can help consumers lower 
overall fat intake because it gives them a choice, without 
sacrificing taste," he said.

Dr. Gail Harrison of the University of California School of 
Public Health in Los Angeles complimented the special 
consultants utilized by FDA as in-depth review experts on 
olestra, calling them "absolutely the best in the field."  
Harrison added, "Their reports can be relied upon in terms 
of scientific validity and perspective."

Recommending approval of the compound, Harrison said she is 
"quite thoroughly acquainted with the data base supporting 
the safety of olestra as it is proposed for use in savory 
snacks in the U.S. food supply, and am convinced on the 
basis of reasonable scientific judgment it is safe by the 
standard that FDA must apply."

Other letters recommending approval came from Dr. Elijah 
Saunders of the University of Maryland's School of 
Medicine, Division of Hypertension, and Dr. George Bray, 
executive director of the Pennington Biomedical Research 
Center at the Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.

A letter from Penny Kris-Etherton, professor of nutrition 
at Penn State University, reiterated conclusions she had 
presented for P&G at the advisory committee meeting -- that 
inclusion of olestra snacks would reduce dietary 
carotenoids over a period of seven days by approximately 
10%.  The calculations assumed that all savory snacks 
included in dietary records randomly selected from study 
subjects in target groups of interest were olestra-
containing snacks, she said.

 "Obviously, in a real world setting, not all savory snacks 
consumed will contain olestra.  Nonetheless, I believe that 
our estimates are reasonable as a means to gain a 
perspective about the average impact of olestra-containing 
snacks in different free-living population groups," Kris-
Etherton added.  ((6FCN 4608, 26 pages, $11)

PETITION NEEDED TO EXPAND ENERGY SOURCES IN POULTRY FEED 
IRRADIATION RULE: FDA

A food additive petition approved recently by the Food and 
Drug Administration sought approval only of the use of gamma 
radiation from cobalt 60 for Salmonella in poultry feed, so 
a separate or supplemental petition would have to be filed 
to expand the approval to include other sources of ionizing 
radiation, the agency said recently (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, 
Oct. 2, Page 42, and Nov. 6, Page 17).

The Center for Veterinary Medicine's George Graber, director 
of the division of animal feeds, discussed the petition in a 
Dec. 6 letter to Paisan Loaharanu, who is part of the 
Secretariat of the International Consultative Group on Food 
Irradiation, International Atomic Energy Agency, in Vienna, 
Austria.  Loaharanu had written to CVM in October, 
questioning why the final rule permitting the irradiation 
was limited to gamma rays from cobalt 60 and did not include 
gamma rays from cesium-137 and electrons and X-rays from 
machine sources.

Loaharanu had asked if there were scientific reasons for 
this limitation, and questioned whether it would be possible 
to include other radiation sources in the regulation.

Petition, Rule Refer Only to Cobalt 60

Graber noted that when Nordion International Inc. filed the 
food additive petition, FDA sought comment only on the use 
of gamma radiation from cobalt 60, but said "no public 
comment was received," and pointed out that the scope of a 
proceeding for issuing a food additive regulation "is 
limited by the terms and conditions of use set out in the 
filed petition."

"To the extent that a person seeks to extend the petitioned-
for terms and conditions of use, the person must do so by 
separate or supplemental petition," Graber added.  He 
thanked Loaharanu for sending a copy of the ICGFI document 
entitled, "Code of Good Irradiation Practice for the Control 
of Pathogenic Microorganisms in Poultry Feed."

Similar letters were sent to E-Beam Services, Cranbury, 
N.J., AECL Technologies, Hauppage, N.Y., and Dr. Elsa Murano 
of the Texas A&M University's Department of Animal Science.  
In objections filed following publication of the rule, all 
had questioned why the regulation limited the source of 
ionizing radiation to gamma radiation from cobalt 60.

In the letters to the companies, Graber noted that nothing 
in the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or in FDA's regulations 
suggests or authorizes that "interested persons use the 
opportunity to object as an opportunity to expand the 
authorized use beyond those sought in the petition."

"Indeed, the records of the rulemaking (the petition and 
comments, in this case, none) only contain information 
concerning the use of cobalt 60, and thus it appears that 
there would be no support in the record for your 
objections," he said.

If FDA were to proceed to complete its evaluation of the 
objections and request for a hearing, "it is likely that the 
agency would deny the request on the basis that the request 
is beyond the scope of the petitioned action and is more 
appropriately resolved through the submission of a food 
additive petition," Graber said, adding that "the proper and 
more timely resolution is the withdrawal of the objection at 
this time and submission of a food additive petition."  He 
urged the companies to withdraw their objections, and 
offered to meet with them about pursuing a food additive 
petition.  ((6FCN 4607, 9 pages, $7 )

AFDO FLOATS PROPOSED FOOD CODE CHANGES TO MEMBERS

Proposed changes to the Food and Drug Administration's 1993 
Food Code have been sent to members of the Association of 
Food and Drug Officials by AFDO's Food Committee, with 
instructions to respond by Jan. 16.

"The impetus for this action came as a result of a 
questionnaire sent by the AFDO Food Committee to state 
officials concerning the 1993 FDA Food Code and subsequent 
workshops during the [AFDO] Annual Conference," AFDO 
President Arthur Dell'Aria said in a Dec. 8 letter that 
accompanied the proposed changes.  In addition, "an Ad Hoc 
Committee was formed to address this task immediately after 
the annual conference.  The Ad Hoc Committee included state 
officials, USDA representation, FDA assistance and 
representatives from the affected industries" (See FOOD 
CHEMICAL NEWS, July 3, Page 25).

In November, FDA issued a 1995 Food Code, which made a 
number of minor changes and clarifications to the 1993 Code; 
an FDA-er referred to the 1995 revision as the "housekeeping 
edition," intended to clean up language, etc., prior to an 
anticipated major overhaul for the 1997 Code.  FDA wanted to 
wait and do the more extensive changes after input is 
received from AFDO and from the Conference for Food 
Protection, which meets in April of this year (See FOOD 
CHEMICAL NEWS, Nov. 6, Page 22).

Potentially Hazardous Foods Subsection Would Be Removed

The subsection in Chapter 1 dealing with potentially 
hazardous foods should be eliminated, AFDO members said, 
because such a variance is unnecessary.  The original 
language noted that  a food is not potentially hazardous if 
"laboratory evidence that is the basis of a variance granted 
by the regulatory authority demonstrates that rapid and 
progressive growth of infectious and toxigenic 
microorganisms or the slower growth of C. botulinum cannot 
occur." 

In Chapter 2, AFDO members suggested adding food manager 
certification "as a means test for demonstration of 
knowledge."  The additional wording would read:  "... the 
person in charge shall demonstrate his knowledge by 
compliance with this code, by being a certified food manager 
who has demonstrated knowledge of required information 
through an accredited test or by responding to the 
inspector's questions when applicable."

The special handwash procedure outlined in Chapter 2, which 
dealt with the procedure food handlers would use after using 
bathroom facilities, should be eliminated, AFDO members 
concurred.  Instead, the section should be renamed "handwash 
procedures" and should be enforced throughout food 
operations.

The variance for recreationally caught scombrotoxin-prone 
fish and all reference to recreationally caught fish in 
Chapter 3 should be eliminated, AFDO members said, with the 
section reading that only fish that are commercially and 
legally caught and harvested may be received for sale or 
service.  Also in that chapter, the variance requirement for 
using more than one tagged or labeled container or 
shellstock at a time should be eliminated.  The handler(s) 
would still be required not to commingle differently tagged 
or labeled groups before the fish is ordered by the 
consumer.

The variance for cooking raw animal foods (such as raw 
shellfish, steak tartare, soft-cooked eggs, etc.) to 
required temperatures should be eliminated, AFDO members 
said, to remove language that grants a variance from the 
section if based on a HACCP plan.  Instead, consumers 
ordering such foods must be informed by food establishments 
of the possible dangers of eating such foods through 
labeling of menus, table tents, etc., AFDO noted, adding 
that consumer advisory requirements would be met by the 
statement:

"Thoroughly cooking foods of animal origin such as beef, 
eggs, fish, lamb, milk, pork, poultry, or shellfish reduces 
the risk of foodborne illness.  Individuals with certain 
health conditions may be at higher risk if these foods are 
consumed raw or undercooked.  Consult your physician or 
public health official for further information."

Two other suggested changes were to eliminate the 
requirement for a variance before brewing alcoholic 
beverages or using food additives as a method of flavor 
enhancement (Chapter 3) and to eliminate the variance 
requirement for utilizing a molluscan shellfish life-support 
system display tank for storage and display of shellfish 
(Chapter 4).  However, the tank system would remain part of 
a hazard analysis critical control point system that assures 
that safety and quality of the fish is not harmed through 
the use of such a tank, among other requirements, AFDO 
members noted.

Ad Hoc Committee Specific Recommendations Cover Food 
Handling, Holding Temperatures

The AFDO Ad Hoc Committee had a number of specific 
recommendations of its own, including rewording of a 
Chapter 2 section on the responsibilities of the "person in 
charge," to include food handling requirements, training 
and the explanation of responsibilities.  Suggested new 
wording included:  "Employees are preventing cross-
contamination of ready-to-eat food with their bare hands by 
properly using suitable utensils such as deli tissue, 
spatulas, tongs or single-use gloves; employees are 
properly trained in food safety; and the responsibilities, 
rights and authorities assigned by this Code are explained 
to the:  1) food employee; 2) person in charge, and 3) 
regulatory authority."

In Chapter 3, the committee suggested the addition of a 
cooking chart that includes minimum cooking times and 
temperatures for a variety of cooked meats, eggs and 
related products  -- "145 F (63 C) for 15 seconds for shell 
eggs for individual order, immediate service, fish, 
seafood, beef, veal, lamb, mutton, etc., not specified 
below; 155 F (68 C) at 15 seconds, or 150 F (68 FC) for 1 
minute, or 145 F(63 C) for 3 minutes, for pork, game 
animals, ground chopped meat and fish, injected meats and 
eggs in multi-serving batches; and 165 F (74 C) for 15 
seconds for field-dressed wild game, poultry, stuffed 
fish, meat pasta or poultry, or stuffing containing fish, 
meat or poultry."

An exemption in the cooking time/temperature requirements 
should be made for whole muscle intact beef steaks prepared 
in response to a consumer's order, the committee noted, 
adding that reheating for hot holding requirements should 
be changed so that the two-hour rapid heating requirement 
would be applied to all reheating practices.

While leaving intact the code's requirements that 
potentially hazardous foods should be stored for hot 
holding at 140 F (60 C) or above or at 41 F (5 C) or below, 
the AFDO committee suggested language be added to allow for 
45 F 

refrigerated storage of potentially hazardous food 
"provided the mechanical refrigeration unit in which the 
food is held is incapable of meeting the [41 F or below] 
requirements; is currently in place and in use; and is 
replaced with a unit that can meet the [41 F or below] 
requirement when replacement is required."

The section in Chapter 3 dealing with ready-to-eat, 
potentially hazardous food disposition would also be 
significantly changed by the ad hoc committee, the report 
explained:

"An addition here would require an automatic cut-off 
control activated by temperatures above 45 F for vending 
machines that dispense ready-to-eat potentially hazardous 
food.  Disposition of temperature-abused foods from such 
systems would be consistent with the requirements for 
other potentially hazardous food (five days or 10 days).  
The reference to manufacturers' 'sell by' or 'use by' date 
is removed, as they are not present on many potentially 
hazardous foods and are not enforced by most states."

As for time as a public health control, the committee 
recommended a change in wording so that hot food would have 
to be served or discarded within two hours from the point 
in time when the food is removed from temperature control 
(the code's four-hour rule would remain in effect for cold 
foods). 

The committee said the exception for pyrethrin-based 
compounds should be removed from the Chapter 7 section on 
application of pesticides.  Also, pesticide treatment by 
uncertified persons under the direct supervision of a 
certified person would be allowed.  The change was 
suggested so that a broad interpretation of "applicable 
law" regarding application of pesticides would be allowed.

In addition, AFDO is recommending a number of rewording, 
editing and reformatting changes for simplification or 
clarification.  ((6FCN 4601, 145 pages, $41).

FSIS IDENTIFIES REFORMS NEEDED BEFORE HACCP IMPLEMENTATION

The Food Safety and Inspection Service Dec. 29 identified 
several areas of reform it says are necessary, both as part 
of the Reinventing Government initiative and because the 
regulations in question need to be changed before the 
planned implementation of a hazard analysis critical control 
point system for meat and poultry inspection (See FOOD 
CHEMICAL NEWS, Sept. 11, Page 46, and related stories, Pages 
25 and 41).

The advance notice of proposed rulemaking lists a number of 
proposed areas ripe for modification or elimination because 
they are inconsistent with HACCP principles.  Such 
regulatory changes will be made before HACCP is implemented 
in plants, the ANPR added.

Regulations mentioned in the ANPR fall into broad 
categories, such as:  definitions; inauguration, suspension 
and withdrawal of suspension; appeals procedures and related 
administrative procedures; reinspection of product entering 
establishments, and retention and disposition of product; 
restrictive, command-and-control type regulations that 
delimit processing and treatment methods intended to 
eliminate specific food safety hazards; and recordkeeping 
and access to records under the Freedom of Information Act.

The ANPR invited comment on any of these areas, and added 
that "FSIS specifically requests comment on its efforts to 
transform regulations from heavy reliance on command-and-
control approaches to greater reliance on performance 
standards, and solicits detailed suggestions concerning 
which existing regulations need to be changed to be 
consistent with HACCP, and how those regulations should be 
changed."

Several specific candidates for revision or removal were 
presented in the ANPR.  Under "definition":

Include general HACCP-related terms and redefine inspection 
organization and activity terms.

Under "application for and grant or refusal of inspection":

Revise prior approval procedures; shift to performance 
standards.

Under "inauguration and withdrawal of inspection; inspection 
program employees":

Clarify role of inspection program.  Integrate this with 
rules for suspending and withdrawing inspection.

Assure that appeals procedures comport with enforcement 
under HACCP.

Under "facilities for inspection":

Clarify standards for essential facilities.

Convert requirements for sanitation and facilities to 
performance standards or decision criteria; supplement with 
guidelines as needed.

Simplify detailed requirements for equipment and 
cleanliness, for example; convert to performance standards 
and/or decision criteria; supplement with guidelines as 
needed.

Convert equipment and cleaning requirements to performance 
standards and/or decision criteria; supplement with 
guidelines as needed.

Remove obsolete provisions for slack barrels, similar 
containers and means of conveyance, and burlap wrapping.

Clarify decision criteria concerning employment of diseased 
persons.

Convert tagging insanitary equipment, utensils, rooms and 
compartments provisions to performance standards; clarify 
role of inspection program employees.

Update rules for temperatures and chilling and freezing 
procedures for poultry and make changes to accommodate HACCP 
(i.e., changes in addition to pathogen reduction amendments 
proposed 2/3/95).

Under "entry into official establishments, reinspection; 
reinspections, preparing and processing establishments":

Convert rules for articles entering establishments and 
product disposal to performance standards and clarify role 
of inspection program employees.

Eliminate prior approval procedures for total quality 
control systems.

Convert requirements for processing procedures and articles 
used in preparing products to performance standards, and 
clarify role of inspection program employees.

Eliminate command-and-control type requirements for the use 
of nitrite and sodium ascorbate or erythorbate in bacon; 
convert these requirements to performance standards and 
clarify role of inspection program employees.

Convert requirements for the treatment of pork and pork 
products to destroy trichinae into performance standards; 
supplement with guidelines as needed.

Convert requirements for preparing articles not for use as 
human food (e.g., dog food) to performance standards; 
clarify role of inspection program employees; eliminate 
command-and-control type requirements.

Eliminate redundancy with other provisions (i.e., mixtures 
containing products that are not classed as meat food 
products).

Convert procedure for handling product adulterated by 
polluted water to performance standards and decision 
criteria; supplement with guidelines as needed.

Convert requirements for tagging chemicals, preservatives, 
cereals, spices, etc., to performance standards; clarify 
role of inspection program employees.

Convert rules for substances such as pesticide chemical 
residues, food additives and color additives to performance 
standards and role of inspection program employees.

Make requirements for handling of certain material for 
mechanical deboning consistent with any new time-temperature 
requirements.

Convert compliance procedures for meat derived from advanced 
meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems to 
performance standards, and clarify role of inspection 
program employees.

Convert requirements for canning and canned products to 
performance standards and clarify role of inspection program 
employees.

Under "transportation":

Eliminate obsolete provisions; focus on and clarify policies 
and performance standards.

Comments are due Feb. 27.  For more information, contact Paula 
Cohen at 202-720-7164.

IBP COMPLAINS OF RED MEAT, POULTRY EQUITY ISSUES AT HACCP 
MEETINGS

IBP, Inc. complained in a recent letter to the Food Safety 
and Inspection Service that recent meetings on the 
HACCP/Pathogen Reduction proposal should have focused on red 
meat versus poultry regulatory equity issues.

In the letter to USDA Acting Undersecretary for Food Safety 
Michael Taylor, the Nebraska firm's James Lochner said he 
attended all six of the HACCP public meetings and the Food 
Safety Forum (See Food Chemical News, Nov. 13, Page 32), but 
that there was "insufficient focus on red meat versus 
poultry regulatory equity issues." 

"There is ample published research demonstrating increased 
food safety risks with poultry as a result of current 
processes allowed by FSIS poultry regulations," Lochner 
said, questioning "why these issues have not been addressed 
in more detail."  

In the second round of comments to the proposal, IBP 
stressed the importance of microbiological testing in HACCP 
validation and ongoing HACCP verification.  The firm also 
stressed that insufficient data exist to use indicator 
organisms for a performance standard.  

"IBP believes USDA has only one choice: microbiological 
guidelines as a HACCP verification component.  This is the 
only viable solution until data is generated on an ongoing 
basis and then related to an increased risk of human 
health."   

Validation should be defined as documenting a critical 
control point that eliminates microbiological hazards, IBP 
said, and, "When possible, validation should demonstrate the 
elimination of pertinent pathogens, i.e., Salmonella and 
Escherichia coli O157:H7."  Validation, Lochner added, 
should be conducted either off-line in a research facility 
or with extensive on-line testing using indicator organisms, 
or with past reported research.

Verification Testing Based on Volume for Large Plants, Time 
for Small Plants Suggested

Verification should be defined as an ongoing demonstration 
of control with microbiological testing to verify that the 
process is in control, according to Lochner IBP's senior 
vice president, technical services.  

USDA should prescribe minimum frequencies for an acceptable 
HACCP program based on volume for large plants and time 
frame for small plants, IBP's Lochner told Taylor, 
recommending one microbiological verification test per 
species per 1,000 head increment per week for large meat and 
poultry plants and a minimum sample frequency of once a week 
for small plants.  For fresh meat and poultry plants that 
are not slaughter plants, microbiological testing as a HACCP 
verification should focus on relative change and operational 
sanitation, Lochner said.

All plants should be required to submit their ongoing HACCP 
microbiological verification results to USDA, which will 
then generate averages and baselines over a two-year period.  
USDA will need to develop details on where samples are 
taken, how they are handled, and laboratory methods for the 
information to be useful, IBP said. 

In other comments, the firm recommended that USDA develop 
criteria for a process step to be classified as an 
antimicrobial treatment, adding that a one log reduction was 
not an effective criterion.  Also, USDA should allow carcass 
cooling rates to be incorporated into HACCP programs with 
micro validation and verification to demonstrate that the 
chill rates control growth of indicator organisms or 
pathogens.  USDA must reconsider the use of immersion 
chilling in poultry "if it seriously wants to improve the 
protection of public health," IBP added.

Finally, IBP urged USDA to move quickly in implementing the 
sweeping regulations and suggested that if certain 
industries or companies are unwilling to improve the 
process, then USDA may require mandatory controls.  "These 
cannot be political decisions," Lochner added.  ((6FCN 4606, 
8 pages, $6)

L. MONOCYTOGENES, B. CEREUS CONTAMINATION PROMPT WARNINGS TO 
WHITEFISH, PEDIATRIC MEDICAL FOOD MANUFACTURERS

Detection of Listeria monocytogenes in processed whitefish 
roe prompted a warning letter from the Food and Drug 
Administration to a Wisconsin fish roe manufacturing 
operation.  The Dec. 11 letter from FDA's Minneapolis 
District to James Vander Mause, president, Atlas 
International, Inc., Jefferson, Wis., said the pathogen was 
detected in a sample collected during an inspection of the 
facility.

FDA said that according to documents obtained during the 
inspection, Atlas does not sample and analyze incoming 
whitefish roe for microbiological pathogens, nor does the 
firm obtain "written assurance from suppliers that the roe 
is in compliance with federal laws and regulations."  The 
agency urged Vander Mause to incorporate a mechanism to 
"assure" that incoming fish roe will not be contaminated.  

Failure to assure compliance with laws and regulations may 
result in regulatory action without further notice, FDA 
warned Vander Mause.  The agency said he should notify the 
agency of "specific steps" taken to correct these 
deficiencies. 

Contamination with diarrheal enterotoxin producing Bacillus 
cereus has caused a pediatric medical food to be deemed 
adulterated, according to a warning letter from FDA's 
Minneapolis District.  

The Dec. 1 letter to David Pyott, president/CEO, Sandoz 
Nutrition, Inc., St. Louis Park, Minn., said samples of the 
firm's Vivonex Pediatric Medical Food were found to be 
contaminated.  While acknowledging that the contamination 
was "spotty," the agency said several portions contained 
>100 B. cereus and of the isolates tested for enterotoxin 
production, all were found to produce enterotoxin.  

FDA noted that the Sandoz contention that there was no 
significance to the B. cereus findings was based on several 
assumptions:  the strain will not grow at a pH of 4.85; 
there is a four-hour growth lag period after hydration, and 
room temperature storage "significantly decreases" rate of 
growth.  The agency added, however, that while this may 
"normally be the case," it should not be assumed for this 
strain, "particularly in a food intended for individuals of 
compromised health."  

Pyott was warned that failure to assure compliance with laws 
and regulations may result in regulatory action without 
further notice.  The agency said he should notify the agency 
of "specific steps" taken to achieve correction of these 
deficiencies.

Insanitary Processing, Storage Conditions Lead to Warnings 
for Mushroom Processing Plant

Michael Giorgio, owner, Prima Foods, Inc., Rehrersburg, Pa., 
received a warning from FDA's Philadelphia District 
concerning violations of acidified food manufacturing 
regulations.

The Dec. 7 letter said an inspection of Giorgio's mushroom 
processing plant revealed the following deficiencies:

water in washing tank was not changed during a full day's 
processing and became "increasingly dirty," resulting in 
mushrooms still bearing soil entering the blancher;

blancher observed with discolored mushrooms and "grease-
like" material adhering to it;

equipment used to hold mushrooms before and after blanching 
was not "adequately cleaned";

walk-in cooler has a drain pipe leading directly outside and 
the pipe was not screened to prevent pest entry;

mushrooms packed in brine remained on packing floor for 
several hours before being refrigerated, with mushrooms 
labeled for refrigeration at 35 F stored in a cooler at 47 F;

brine solution for coldpack mushrooms was stored in open vat 
and hand-dipped to fill mushroom container, with ascorbic acid 
used in brine preparation stored in uncovered container;

pH meter was used without being standardized;

blancher auger had flaked rust between blades and the rubber 
conveyor leading into blancher was frayed at edges, and 

a "large amount" of steam built up in the building.

In addition, FDA noted that several mushroom samples were 
found to contain "very high levels" of bacteria, leading the 
agency to be concerned that this may be "indicative of poor 
processing or handling practices."

FDA said that Giorgio acknowledged that Prima Foods should 
have "ceased production" of the mushrooms and that should 
the firm wish to make these foods in the future, 
registration as an acidified food manufacturer is required.

'Serious Violations' Alleged at California Fish Processing 
Operation

FDA's San Francisco District sent a warning letter to Robert 
Johnson, president, MFM, Inc., Berkeley, Calif., saying that 
an inspection of his 

shell fish and fin fish processing operations in San 
Francisco revealed "serious violations" of food 
manufacturing regulations.  

According to the Dec. 1 letter:

water lines serving processing operations lacked backflow 
prevention devices;

raw shrimp were held in a metal, perforated container, 
placed directly on a wet floor and washed with a water spray 
from a hand-held hose;

inspectors observed soap suds draining from drain board 
containing thawing shrimp, large drinking cup floating in 
sink, fork "nearly submerged" among shrimp and "personnel 
items" on drain board;

chemical cleaners were stored on shelf directly above fish 
in open cardboard box;

employees were seen handling hoses and other non-food items 
then resuming processing of seafood without washing or 
sanitizing hands, and

an unprotected ice machine, with standing water in three-
sided trough at its base, was located in an area allowing 
car and forklift traffic.

FDA also said that L. monocytogenes, Type 1, was detected in 
a swab sample taken from the surface of a packaging table.  
The swab was among several other environmental swabs found 
to be negative for Listeria and Salmonella microorganisms.  

Johnson was told to take "appropriate steps" to correct 
these violations to prevent adulteration of foods 
processed by the facility.  Adulterated foods are subject 
to seizure, the agency added.  

Insect, Rodent Findings at Bakery Draw Warning Letter

An FDA warning letter to Ralph Pacifico, president, Angelo 
Pacifico & Sons, Inc., Altoona, Pa., said insanitary 
conditions at the bakery resulted in bakery products being 
adulterated.  

The Nov. 22 letter from the agency's Philadelphia District 
said beetle-like insects and one larval stage insect were 
found throughout the flour storage and conveyor system, one 
dead mouse was found on the production floor near mixes, and 
exposed bread products and "potential rodent entry points" 
were observed.

FDA said its laboratory analysis of flour revealed insects 
in various stages of the beetle life cycle, indicating 
nesting.  Analysis of various finished bread products 
revealed rodent hair, insect fragments and cat or dog hair, 
the agency added.  

During the inspection of the bakery, it was noted that the 
conveyor and access panels were welded or glued shut, making 
inspection and cleaning "more difficult," FDA noted.  The 
firm's response that it would initiate a program aimed at 
cleaning the whole flour system "until no further insect 
nesting activity is noticed" is not sufficient, the agency 
added, saying that the company needs an "effective, ongoing 
sanitation program" to eliminate the insanitary conditions.  

Pacifico was told to take prompt action to correct these 
deficiencies.  Failure to do so, the agency added, may 
result in regulatory action, such as seizure and/or 
injunction, without further notice.    

'Insanitary Conditions' Cause Stored Foods To Be Deemed 
Adulterated

Foods at an Alabama warehouse have been deemed adulterated 
due to "insanitary conditions," according to a warning 
letter from FDA's Nashville District.

The Dec. 12 letter to J. Barton Greer, Jr., chairman of the 
board, Autry Greer & Sons, Prichard, said an inspection of 
the facility revealed a "widespread insect infestation" in 
the dry storage portion of the warehouse; spilled products 
at numerous locations within the warehouse; food products 
stored directly against the wall; insecticides and other 
hazardous chemicals stored directly adjacent to food items; 
poor handling of distressed food products, and damaged 
floors and walls in produce and meat coolers.  In addition, 
FDA said that 10 separate lots of food products, including 
flour, cornmeal, rice, beans and instant pudding, were found 
to be insect infested.

Greer was told to take prompt action to correct these 
deficiencies or face possible regulatory action such as 
seizure and/or injunction.  

Undeclared Colors Prompt Warning Letters

FDA's Chicago District sent a warning letter to Rashid 
Sweiss, president, Eden International, Inc., Blue Island, 
Ill., concerning misbranding of two of the firm's products. 

The Aug. 30 letter said that "Eden's Red Chickpeas" 
contained undeclared FD&C Red #3 and "Eden's Gourmet Mix" 
contained undeclared FD&C Red #40.  FDA also advised Sweiss 
that net contents need to be declared in metric as well as 
in inch-pound units.  Sweiss was told to inform the agency 
of steps taken to correct the violations.  

Airlines Warned About Insanitary Processing Facilities, 
Public Conveyance Violations 

Food processing and watering point violations involving the 
airline industry were subjects of warning letters from FDA's 
San Francisco District.

Herbert Kelleher, president and CEO, Southwest Airlines, 
received a Nov. 21 letter pointing out several processing 
deficiencies as well as watering point violations.

The insanitary conditions resulted in a classification of 
the facilities as "Not Approved."  

A "Non-Approved" or "Use Prohibited" classification was 
awarded to a facility serving the airline industry, 
according to another warning letter from FDA's San Francisco 
District.

The Dec. 1 letter to David Tam, president, Tam Fresh Cut-
Pack, Inc., Sacramento, Calif., said an inspection of the 
facility revealed the following:  lack of chemical test kits 
for chlorine sanitizer; standing water on floor near 
vegetable sink and floor of walk-in refrigerator; vegetables 
in boxes stored directly on refrigerator floors; 

knives on soiled surfaces were not sanitized; lack of 
functional thermometers in walk-in refrigerators; 
accumulation of old, slimy vegetable debris on onion slicer; 
accumulation of old food debris on exterior of scales; waste 
water flows across driveway to sewer, with employees seen 
walking through this water while cleaning food containers; 
unshielded fluorescent lights over processing areas, and 
unsealed hole in double wall in production area providing 
possible hole in the wall for vermin. 

Both Kelleher and Tam were told to notify the agency of 
steps taken to correct the violations.  

Manufacturing, Labeling Violations of Vet Products Disclosed 
in FDA Warnings

Failure to follow good manufacturing practice regulations 
for finished pharmaceuticals resulted in FDA issuing a 
warning to a Missouri veterinary drug manufacturer.

The Dec. 5 letter from FDA's Kansas City District to Henry 
Bobe, president/chief executive officer, Fermenta Animal 
Health Company, said an inspection of the firm's Elwood, 
Kan., facility revealed the following "significant 
deviations":

failure to establish and follow an adequate process 
validation plan for all tablet, bolus and powder products to 
assure they have the identity, strength, quality and purity 
they purport or are represented to possess;

failure to include directions in certain product Master 
Formula Records to recirculate product from the dead space 
at the base of the ribbon blender, and 

failure to have in place an adequate method validation for 
finished product analysis.  

Noting that the inspection consisted in part of pre-
approval review of manufacturing compliance, FDA said the 
deviations must be corrected before the district can concur 
with approval of the ANADAs and it has therefore 
recommended to the Center for Veterinary Medicine that 
approval of these ANADAs be withheld.  FDA said the 
inspection also revealed that a manufacturing change had 
been instituted for another product "without CVM approval."   

Bobe was told to notify FDA of the specific steps taken to 
correct the noted violations.  

FDA's Los Angeles District sent a warning letter to Louis 
Gottlieb, president, Very Healthy Enterprises, Inglewood, 
Calif., noting that several of the firms products are new 
animal drugs which are not the subject of approved NADAs.

The April 3 letter said that a new animal drug may not be 
legally marketed unless it is the subject of an approved 
NADA.  FDA said the following products are not generally 
recognized as safe and effective for the indications for use 
in their labeling:

Ear Relief Natural Medicine & Ear Cleanser for Dogs and 
Cats; Scratch Free Natural Medicine for Dogs and Cats; Eye-C 
Eye Medicine for Dogs and Cats with Vitamin C and Zinc (Zinc 
Plus C Ophthalmic Solution); Flea Relief Natural Medicine 
and Diar-relief Natural Medicine.

Gottlieb was told to take prompt action to correct these 
violations or face possible regulatory action, such as 
seizure and/or injunction, without further notice.

FDA's Buffalo District has warned a veterinary products 
company that it is manufacturing/repacking and distributing 
adulterated and misbranded new animal drugs.

In a May 17 letter to Richard Sanzen, president, Equest Inc., 
Saratoga Veterinary Products Co., Saratoga Springs, N.Y., FDA 
said no NADAs are in effect for the firm's Equi-Spaz Paste, 
Re-Coup and Doloflex products.  The firm's failure to provide 
FDA with a  list all drugs manufactured/repacked results in 
the products being deemed misbranded, FDA said.  The agency 
said Sanzen should take action to ensure that the firm meets 
all federal law and regulation requirements.

Violations of Medicated Feed Mill Regulations Described in 
FDA Warnings

Phil Yoder, president, Yoder Feeds, Kalona, Iowa, received a 
warning letter from FDA's Kansas City District concerning 
violations of federal current good manufacturing regulations 
for medicated feeds.  

The Oct. 18 letter said an inspection of the facility 
revealed a failure to perform assays at periodic intervals 
for all medicated feeds requiring approved applications, and 
the use of Type A articles in the manufacture of medicated 
feeds beyond their labeled expiration dates.  

Failure to correct these deficiencies may result in 
regulatory action, such as seizure and/or injunction, 
without further notice, FDA said.  

The Kansas City District also sent a warning letter to 
Leland Smith, president, Custom Feed Services Corp., 
Norfolk, Nebr. concerning medicated feed manufacturing 
violations.

In the June 30 letter, FDA said an inspection of Smith's 
facility revealed a failure to conduct the required number 
of assays of medicated feeds in a calendar year.

Smith was informed by FDA that failure to correct these 
deficiencies may result in regulatory action, such as 
seizure and/or injunction, without further notice.

FDA's Cincinnati District sent a similar letter to Leslie 
Gossett, terminal manager, PM AG Products, Inc., Owensboro, 
Ky.  In its Dec. 7 letter, the agency said deviations from 
medicated feed regulations included the failure to:  provide 
a drug scale suitable for the units or weights for which it 
is used; assure daily inventory records are accurate and 
adequate, and check batch records to determine that all 
required steps have been performed, as errors were found in 
drug receipt and production records.

Gossett was urged by FDA to establish procedures whereby 
such violations do not recur.  Until the violations have 
been corrected and the corrections verified by FDA, CVM will 
not approved medicated feed applications from the facility, 
the agency added.

FDA Notes Illegal Drug Residues in Animals Intended for 
Human Food

FDA's Seattle District warned two animal producers 
concerning the detection of illegal drug residues in animals 
intended for use as human food.

In an April 13 letter to Cornelius Timmermans, Lynden, 
Wash., FDA said a USDA analysis of a calf revealed the 
presence of neomycin at 7.27 ppm and tetracycline at 0.96 
ppm in the kidney.  Neomycin residues in the kidney of 
another calf were found at 41.54 ppm, the agency noted.

Al and Anna Biemold, Cascade Farms, Everson, Wash., also 
received a warning letter from the Seattle District.  The 
April 3 letter said a USDA analysis of a bob veal calf 
detected residues of neomycin at 3.31 ppm and 8.80 ppm 
tetracycline in kidney tissue.

Timmermans and the Biemolds were told to correct the 
violations and to establish procedures to prevent their 
recurrence.  Failure to do so, FDA added, may result in 
regulatory action without further notice.

Two warning letters concerning detection of illegal drug 
residues were also sent by FDA's Cincinnati District.

A Dec. 11 letter to Ray Geiser, Apple Creek, Ohio, said a 
USDA analysis of a bob veal calf revealed the presence of 
0.48 ppm penicillin in the kidney and 0.43 ppm in the liver.  

In a Dec. 4 letter, Roger Morlock, Valley City, Ohio, was 
told that a USDA analysis of a bob veal calf detected 
tetracycline in the liver at 1.3 ppm and in the kidney at 
4.3 ppm.  

FDA said Geiser and Morlock hold animals under conditions 
"so inadequate" that diseased animals and/or medicated 
animals bearing potentially harmful drug residues are likely 
to enter the food chain.  Both were urged to correct these 
violations and to establish procedures to prevent their 
recurrence.

Louis Agueda, Merced, Calif., received a warning from FDA's 
San Francisco District.  The Nov. 15 letter said a USDA 
analysis of a cull dairy cow revealed the presence of 
oxytetracycline in the liver at 5.3 ppm and in the kidney at 
0.26 ppm.  

Noting that Agueda has "a history" of offering adulterated 
animals for sale for human food, FDA said other animals 
contained illegal antibiotic residues and one tested CAST 
positive.  

FDA said Agueda lacks adequate systems for determining the 
medicated status of animals, for assuring that medicated 
animals are withheld from slaughter for appropriate periods 
of time and for assuring that drugs are used according to 
label directions.  The agency added that Agueda should 
correct these deficiencies or face regulatory action, such as 
seizure and/or injunction, without further notice.  ((6FCN

SINGLE PETITION PROCESS FOR ADDITIVES TO BE USED ON MEAT OR 
POULTRY PROPOSED BY FSIS, FDA

The Food and Drug Administration and Agriculture Department's 
Food Safety and Inspection Service Dec. 29 proposed a 
simplification of the review process for food additive, color 
additive and generally recognized as safe affirmation 
petitions for substances that are to be used on meat or 
poultry products.  Currently, such products must go through 
separate FDA and FSIS reviews, the proposal suggests a single 
joint review instead. There were two notices published on the 
issue, one from FDA, one from FSIS, both in the Dec. 29 
Federal Register.

Under the proposal, a single petition would be submitted to 
FDA, which would pass on pertinent petitions or parts of 
petitions to FSIS.  Future FSIS listings for meat and 
poultry additives would be harmonized with those of FDA and 
incorporated into FDA's regulations, "providing a basis for 
the eventual elimination of FSIS' separate listing in Title 
9 CFR," said the FDA notice.  An FSIS notice said that the 
Title 9 review will occur in three to five years, leading to 
the elimination of duplicative listings found in FDA's Title 
21.  FSIS will continue to retain a small list of specific 
substance use prohibitions and will add new prohibitions as 
necessary, the FSIS notice said.

FAPs, CAPs and GRAS affirmation petitions not involving use 
in meat, meat products or poultry would not be affected by 
this proposal, and would continue to be reviewed by FDA 
only.

The two agencies developed a memorandum of understanding on 
how they will work together 

in reviewing such petitions.  Basically, according to the 
MOU published in the FSIS notice, FDA will share pertinent 
petitions with FSIS, and FSIS will provide advice to FDA on 
any criteria, restrictions, conditions of use or other 
prohibitions that may be necessitated by the Federal Meat 
Inspection Act or the Poultry Products Inspection Act.

Some notable specifics of that MOU include:

"In situations where FSIS' Title 9 and FDA's Title 21 do not 
specifically address the intended use of a particular 
substance for meat or poultry products, any interested party 
may request that FSIS evaluate the status of such use.  FSIS 
will conduct a review and determine whether the use is 
acceptable in meat and poultry products, including whether 
the use is approved under the FFDCA (Federal Food, Drug and 
Cosmetic Act).  Under the terms of the MOU, FSIS would seek 
FDA's concurrence with FSIS' review and conclusions.  If FDA 
does not concur that the use is approved under the FFDCA, 
the petitioner would be required to submit a food additive 
or color additive petition to FDA requesting that FDA's 
regulations be amended to accommodate the requested use.

"In situations in which FDA receives a petition for the use 
of a substance or a use of a substance that is not approved 
under the FFDCA, a petitioner shall prepare and submit a 
food additive petition or a color additive petition only to 
FDA.  FDA will consult with FSIS regarding petitions for 
meat and poultry use, and, under the terms of the MOU, FSIS 
concurrence would be required for the approval of the use of 
substances intended for use in meat and poultry and that are 
codified in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

"FSIS will provide any advice to FDA, in writing, on any 
criteria, restrictions, conditions of use, or prohibitions 
FSIS believes necessary concerning use of the products 
subject to the FMIA and the PPIA.

"Requests for a determination (by FSIS) of the acceptability 
of substances may result in the need for rulemaking when (1) 
FSIS standards of identity and composition preclude the use 
of a substance; or (2) there is concern about the 
suitability of a substance for the intended use because the 
substance has never been used in meat and poultry before, or 
the applications of the substance are new, e.g., a new meat, 
meat food, or poultry product category.

"Requests for determination of acceptability of new 
substances and new uses of substances in meat and poultry 
products are currently submitted by the requester ... to 
FSIS.  FSIS will continue to require that a request for an 
acceptability determination for the use of a new substance 
in meat and poultry or for the new use of an approved 
substance be supported by information and technical data 
that establish that (1) the use of the substance will not 
render the product in which it is used adulterated or 
misbranded and (2) the proposed use of the substance is at 
the lowest level necessary to accomplish the intended 
technical effect(s) in each category of the product in which 
the substance is used.

"The evaluation by FSIS of the acceptable use of a new 
substance or new use of a substance in meat and poultry 
products subject to this MOU will be based on the following 
conditions that must be addressed by the requester.  The 
conditions set forth are in accordance with the provisions 
for use of substances in 9 CFR and 21 CFR:  (1) The 
substance has a documented history of use in foods; (2) The 
substance is derived from food or a food ingredient and is 
not considered to be a chemical or synthesized additive; (3) 
The process for manufacturing the substance does not result 
in a severe alteration of the molecular structure resulting 
in the formation of a chemical residue whose safety has not 
been shown; (4) The safety of the substance has been 
evaluated by an independent authority and adequate safety 
data have been presented; (5) The suitability and efficacy 
of the substance have been shown through adequate data 
submission.  The lowest level of the substance necessary to 
achieve the intended functional effect must be shown, and 
the use cannot render the products to which the substance is 
intended for use adulterated or misbranded; (6) The FDA has 
determined the common or usual name of the substance, and 
(7) FDA must concur with FSIS' determination of 
acceptability in order to allow use."

Proposal Part of FSIS Reinventing Government Process

Several regulatory reforms were published by FSIS Dec. 29 
(See related stories, Pages 18 and 41).  "By adopting modern 
regulatory tools and streamlining or eliminating old rules 
and requirements, we will enhance the safety of meat and 
poultry products on the tables of America," said USDA Acting 
Under Secretary for Food Safety Michael Taylor in a Jan. 2 
statement.  The proposals were all part of the agency's 
Reinventing Government initiative (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, 
Sept. 11, 1995, Page 46).

According to the Dec. 29 FDA Federal Register notice, the 
reason for the change was that:

"Over the years, the two agencies have cooperated on food 
ingredient issues on an as-needed, substance-specific, and 
case-by-case basis.  Nonetheless, because of their different 
regulatory needs, the two agencies' regulations governing 
the use of these substances in foods are cast in formats and 
terms that are not fully consistent with one another.  This 
absence of consistency causes difficulty and inconvenience 
to persons who need to refer to both agencies' regulations 
on approved substances and uses."

In addition, it is not clear where one agency's jurisdiction 
ends and another's begins, the notice said, and this has led 
to both agencies conducting separate, sequential review and 
rulemakings before a new meat or poultry use can be 
permitted.  "Many years can elapse between the time a 
manufacturer petitions FDA for the approval of a food 
additive or a color additive under the act and the 
appearance of FSIS regulations of approval for meat and 
poultry uses," the FDA notice said.

The notice went on to say that under the proposal, such 
substances would be authorized for use in meat and poultry 
products under the jurisdiction of FSIS on the basis of 
FDA's regulations.  Future FDA food additive, color additive 
and GRAS substance affirmation listings would specify any 
approved meat or poultry product uses, and the conditions of 
such uses, in accordance with FSIS recommendations "to the 
extent those recommendations are consistent with" the 
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.

In the future, FDA will include in its listings the amounts 
and uses of substances permitted for meat and poultry 
products, the FSIS notice proposed.

Also, the administrator of FSIS would retain legal authority 
to prohibit or restrict the use of specific substance(s) in 
meat or poultry products by notice-and-comment rulemaking, 
"but is not expected to have to exercise that authority on a 
regular basis because FDA's statutory authority, exercised 
in accord with the MOU, would provide a basis for 
appropriate limitations on uses in meat and poultry 
products," it continued.

Another proposed change in the regulations states that 
sorbic acid, calcium carbonate, and other salts of sorbic 
acid "shall not" (as opposed to the current "may not") "be 
used in cooked sausage or any other product; sulfurous acid 
and salts of sulfurous acid shall not be used in or on any 
product, and niacin or nicotinamide shall not be used in or 
on fresh product, except that potassium sorbate, 
propylparaben (propyl p- hydrobenzoate), calcium propionate, 
sodium propionate, benzoic acid, and sodium benzoate may be 
used in or on any product provided in 21 CFR or by a 
regulation in this subchapter" --         9 CFR 318.1(d)(2).

GRAS Products Subject of Special Provision

"Substances whose use is GRAS, however, are exempt from the 
premarket approval requirements of the act and need not be 
listed in FDA's regulations in 21 CFR.  For a substance that 
is not affirmed by FDA as GRAS or otherwise listed (in 21 
CFR parts 182 or 184) of FDA's regulations, or for a GRAS 
substance listed by FDA for general food use, where meat and 
poultry uses are neither specified not prohibited, FSIS 
would continue to consider a manufacturer's basis for 
claiming GRAS status and suitability for use in meat or 
poultry products,"

the notice said, adding that FSIS would make the 
determination in consultation with FDA as needed to ensure 
the appropriate advice is given and that FDA has notice of 
the determination.

Substances currently listed as GRAS for food use generally 
(in accordance with good manufacturing practices) would be 
considered GRAS by USDA for use in meat, meat food products 
and poultry products, unless otherwise restricted by FSIS 
regulations such as standards of identity or composition, 
"or in specific cases where the inspection program 
determines that use may adulterate the product," FSIS added.

Manufacturers also have the option of seeking advice from 
FSIS regarding the suitability of products currently listed 
in FDA regulations for general use in foods or for use in 
meat or poultry products.  "FSIS' responses and related 
correspondence could be available to the public, except that 
the formulation and process data for proprietary mixtures 
would be kept confidential," the FSIS proposal said, adding:  
"Parties requesting such evaluations would be advised to 
petition FDA when the requested use is not permitted under 
FDA's regulations."

The notice said that such inquiries should be addressed to 
Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection 
Service, Product Assessment Division, USDA, FSIS, RP, West 
End Court Building, Washington, DC 20250-3700.

FSIS Will Maintain Listing of Authorized Substances for 
Interested Parties

"FSIS' title 9 listing of authorized substances is 
incomplete, inconsistent with, and duplicative of FDA's 
listings," said the FSIS notice.  "The agency plans to 
eliminate its current listing over time by rulemaking as 
listings are determined to be duplicative of FDA 
regulations.  However, FSIS will retain its own regulations 
on specific substance use prohibitions and will add new 
prohibitions as necessary."

Also, for the convenience of its inspectors, inspected 
establishments and other interested persons, FSIS will 
maintain a comprehensive listing, in its directive system, 
of substances authorized for meat and poultry uses under 
USDA's 9 CFR and FDA's 21 CFR.  This listing will include:

Substances currently listed in 9 CFR;

Substances currently listed for meat or poultry uses in FDA 
food additive, GRAS or prior-sanctioned listings;

Approved color additives currently listed under FDA 
regulations (21 CFR section 73,74, and 82), approved food 
additives listed in 21 CFR 172-173 and 180, prior sanctioned 
substances listed under part 181, GRAS substances listed in 
21 CFR 182 and 184, if permitted for general use on foods 
(which includes meat and poultry) in accordance with good 
manufacturing practices, unless meat or poultry uses of the 
substances are otherwise precluded;

GRAS substances found by FSIS to be suitable for specified 
meat and poultry uses on the basis of information and data 
submitted by petitioners to FSIS.  Factors affecting FSIS 
findings of suitability include:  Existing FDA GRAS 
listings, which need not explicitly permit but may not 
preclude the specific use in meat or poultry products; and, 
concurrence of FSIS with the petitioners and FDA acceptance 
of FSIS' determination;

FDA food additive, color additive, GRAS, prior-sanctioned 
substance listings promulgated after this proposal becomes 
final that provide for meat and poultry uses.

Comments must be received by Feb. 27 (at FSIS) or March 14 
(at FDA).  For more information, contact FSIS' Ralph 
Stafko at 202-720-8168 or FDA's George Pauli at 202-418-
3090.

NU-TECH POULTRY SYSTEM RESULTS IN LESS VISIBLE CONTAMINATION 
BUT SIMILAR MICRO COUNTS, FSIS SAYS

An automated poultry evisceration system being tested in a 
Georgia plant significantly reduced visible carcass 
contamination over a Streamlined Inspection System line, but 
microbiology tests between the two lines were not 
significantly different, according to a Food Safety and 
Inspection Service midterm report on the pilot project (See 
FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Oct. 23, Page 30).

The October report on Stork Gamco's Nu-Tech Poultry 
Processing System, being tested in a Gainesville ConAgra 
plant, concluded that "the data supports continuing the 
pilot and approving a second pilot to verify the Nu-Tech 
system."  The Nu-Tech system operates at up to 140 birds per 
minute, with four USDA inspectors.

Postmortem disposition agreement for the Nu-Tech and SIS-2 
lines compared favorably (0.7% for the Nu-Tech line vs. 0.4% 
for the SIS-2 line) and supports the acceptability of the 
inspection procedure, the FSIS report said, adding that 
"higher condemnation rates on the Nu-Tech line may be due to 
improved visibility of the viscera target organs and the 
inside carcass cavity."

The Nu-Tech system's complete evisceration prior to 
inspection "greatly reduced internal and external visible 
contamination (digestive tract contents, feces, gall)," the 
FSIS report said, adding, "Visibly cleaner carcasses were 
presented for inspection.  Carcasses prior to final washing 
and chilling were visibly cleaner.  Visible contamination on 
the Nu-Tech line remained constant from post-evisceration to 
the final wash at 11% outside contamination and 4%-5% inside 
contamination.  Visible contamination was markedly higher 
and increased on the SIS-2 line from post-evisceration to 
the final wash from 19%-27% outside contamination and 12%-
15% inside contamination."  The Nu-Tech evisceration probe 
causes less organ damage compared to the conventional spoon 
eviscerator, FSIS said.

The number of carcasses identified for reprocessing at the 
inspection stations was similar for both systems.  The Nu-
Tech line was higher, as expected, FSIS said, adding, "The 
one-step evisceration on the Nu-Tech line prior to 
inspection allows for greater visibility inside the bird.  
The SIS-2 reprocessing rate does not include the inside and 
outside carcass contamination observed post-inspection at 
viscera separation."

No Correlation Between Visible Contamination and Microbial 
Load:  FSIS

The microbiological testing "showed no significant 
difference between the lines or between points within each 
line," the report said, adding, "There does not appear to 
be correlation between the amount of visible contamination 
on the carcass and the microbial load."

The report noted a "significant decrease in Salmonella 
presence on the SIS-2 line between rehang and prior to the 
cropper.  The interpretation of the Salmonella decrease in 
this study is not clear and will require further evaluation 
of the raw data."  ((6FCN 4609, 19 pages, $9)




Nu-Tech Project Has Lost Union Support:  Carney

The Nu-Tech pilot project, called the Poultry Carcass 
Inspection/Evisceration Project (PCIEP) by FSIS, has lost 
the support of the inspectors' union, the National Joint 
Council of Food Inspection Locals, NJC Chairman David 
Carney said in a Dec. 19 letter to acting Under Secretary 
for Food Safety Michael Taylor.

At a Dec. 14 consultation with the agency on the project, 
Carney said, "it was evident ... that FSIS management has 
made every attempt to promote PCIEP to the poultry industry 
by reducing the number of the line inspectors and increasing 
line speeds. ... FSIS has been remiss in the efforts of 
promoting PCIEP by not conducting ergonomic impact studies 
and has yet to follow through with Cumulative Trauma 
Disorder Task Group.  With lack of supporting data for PCIEP 
progression, the National Joint Council must now take the 
position that we can no longer subject inspectors to 
whimsical accommodations to the poultry industry.  It will 
now be the position of the National Joint Council that (the 
union) will no longer participate in Poultry Carcass 
Inspection Evisceration Projects."

The union asked to negotiate the "'methods, means and 
technology' of performing work" with FSIS.  Carney noted 
that although the NJC's Southern Council had engaged in a 
memorandum of understanding for the ConAgra pilot plant, 
"this does not circumvent nor diminish impact to the 
bargaining unit at other proposed test sites."

Inspectors Walk Off Line at Georgia Poultry Plant; FSIS to 
Fill Future Vacancies

As many as eight FSIS inspectors walked off a poultry line 
at a Georgia plant for several minutes recently because they 
had not been given a break.  The union said the action 
underscores how serious the shortage of inspectors has 
become.  FSIS officials said a break was planned for the 
inspectors, but that the inspectors walked off the line 
before the Inspector-in-Charge could get to them.  FSIS 
officials said poultry carcasses piled up on the floor 
during the inspectors' absence and that the agency may take 
disciplinary action.  "This tells me they think they're more 
important than the food hundreds of people are going to 
eat," one agency official said.

The only solace for the agency and industry is that the 
shortage may not get any worse.  Taylor has apparently 
decided to hire one new inspector for every one that leaves 
in the future, although the new inspector may be hired in a 
different area if agency officials think a more critical 
vacancy exists elsewhere.

Final 1,000-Plant Review Report Reiterates: Sanitation 
Biggest Problem

The final report of the 1,000-plant review conducted by 
FSIS' Review and Assessment Program was released last month, 
and the conclusions were similar to those of an interim 
report:  sanitation remains the biggest problem found in 
plants (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, March 13, Page 27).

The review of 1,014 plants between October 1993 and February 
1995 resulted in 129 plants being issued Accelerated 
Deficiency Notices.  Sixty percent of all deficiencies found 
in the review were in the area of sanitation, and over 90% 
of those deficiencies were found in less than half of the 
plants reviewed.  The report also said that "dramatic short-
term decreases" in sanitation problems were found in plants 
where ADNs and Progressive Enforcement Action measures were 
applied.  The 1,000-plant review results were used to 
develop FSIS' proposed standard operating procedures for 
sanitation included in the HACCP proposal.  ((6FCN 4611, 22

DRAFT NUTRITION ACTION PLAN URGES HACCP, FOOD CODE ADOPTION

A draft report of the U.N. Plan of Action for Nutrition 
recommended the application of HACCP to pre- and post-
harvest of all foods and encouraged universal adoption of 
the Food and Drug Administration Model Food Code by all 
levels of government.

The U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Health and Human 
Services and Agency for International Development are 
seeking comment on the draft plan by Jan. 29, a Dec. 28 
Federal Register notice said.  The final U.S. Plan for 
Action is to be submitted to the World Health Organization 
for approval.  The latest effort stemmed from a 1992 meeting 
of the International Conference on Nutrition in Rome where 
159 countries agreed upon a general blueprint for improving 
world nutrition status.

Besides the HACCP and Food Code recommendations, the draft 
plan urged policymakers to improve the health and 
environmental status in animal agricultural systems by 
expanding the use of proven research such as baseline 
studies of microbiological problems to gauge contamination 
levels in the slaughter and processing of cattle and other 
species.

The report urged expanded automated information systems such 
as the Field Automation and Information Management 
initiative to support the modernization of USDA field 
inspection programs.  In-plant inspectors should have access 
to automated information systems and such technology should 
be used to improve field to headquarters communication, the 
draft plan recommended.

Plan Also Calls for Monitoring Dietary Exposure to Toxic 
Chemicals

Other recommended strategies to improve U.S. food safety 
included:  stepped-up monitoring of dietary exposure to 
toxic chemicals in foods, and continued assurances that food 
and food ingredients developed through new processing, 
packaging and packaging technologies are safe and 
nutritious.  Special nutritional foods should be regulated 
following the same standards of method and validation as for 
regular foods, the draft plan said.

The government-wide plan endorsed new technologies that 
increase shelf life of perishables, improve safety in crop 
production including Integrated Pest Management, and improve 
ways to monitor food additives and detect toxic chemicals in 
foods.

One emphasis in the draft plan was on expanding public 
education on food safety by promoting the use of hotlines 
and enhancing government disease reporting systems. 

The draft plan earmarked gaps in the U.S. food safety system 
that must be addressed in order to improve good health and 
nutrition.  The plan's authors recommended that more food 
processing operations use modern, proved effective systems 
to prevent food contamination, that legal requirements and 
enforcement for safe food handling need to keep pace with 
changes in marketing and preparation, and that some public 
water systems need to be upgraded.

The nutrition plan also focused on the need for improved 
diagnosis and reporting of foodborne and waterborne 
illnesses and for expanded consumer education.  Gaps in the 
following food safety research areas were highlighted:  

"Rapid detection and identification of foodborne and 
waterborne biological, chemical, and physical hazards; 
prevention of food and water, biological, chemical, and 
physical contamination; achievement of desired behavioral 
changes among consumers and food producers and processors; 
measurement of the incidence of foodborne and waterborne 
illness; and assessment of risk related to microbial 
organisms." 

Nutrition Monitoring Gaps Identified in Draft Report

Pointing to the current budget climate, the draft plan 
ranked the "most critical gaps" in nutrition monitoring that 
should be corrected.  

The report urged the government to develop culturally 
sensitive survey instruments for dietary information from 
high-risk groups; a set of methods and interpretive criteria 
for nutritional status and health conditions and improved 
dietary indicators; and methods that can be used by states, 
local communities and researchers that are comparable with 
national methods and allow for surveillance.  Guidelines for 
verifying and updating food composition data should also be 
revised as new methodologies are developed, the draft plan 
said.

The report also cited gaps in nutrition-sensitive food 
production and economic programs and agricultural research 
that can hinder efforts to incorporate nutrition 
considerations in national policies.  The draft plan found 
that decision-makers need to improve coordination and 
dissemination of nutrition information to food producers, 
improve information on sustainable agriculture, step up 
research information to support cost/benefit analysis of 
nutrition policies, and increase interdisciplinary training 
for those seeking careers in nutrition.

To address gaps, the report recommended a strategy that 
included basic research to enhance plant germplasm and 
sustainable production, to increase animal and fish 
production through integrated management and health systems, 
and to beef up economic analysis methods that can chart 
costs and benefits to society of healthy eating.  

The draft plan identified gaps in human nutrition research 
that may block understanding between diet and disease.  

Issues identified included:  the range in intake of 
nutrients and other food components that optimize health 
and reduce chronic disease; patterns of food intake and 
physical activity that provide the nutrition standard and 
appropriate energy balance to improve health; the point 
where nutrients interact with human genes to alter disease 
risk; factors affecting adoption and maintenance of 
behaviors that support optimal nutrition and physical 
activity patterns; and how research can translate into 
community interventions that improve health and 
nutritional status.

The draft plan called for expanded public and private 
basic and applied research into a host of areas, such as 
basic studies of nutrition and dietary modulation of gene 
expression and cellular and metabolic processes, 
bionutrition, interaction with nutrients and environmental 
agents, safer upper limits of nutrition and nutritionally 
vulnerable populations.

The document also mentioned gaps in U.S. policies that 
promote breastfeeding and proposed strategies to fix them.  

The draft U.S. action plan identified the following themes 
in the December document:  Eating for Health, Nutrition 
Security for All, Safe Food and Water from Source to 
Table, Promoting Breastfeeding, Nutrition-Sensitive Food 
Production and Economic Policy, Human Nutrition Research 
and Nutrition Monitoring.  The plan also includes an 
international section, which outlines how the U.S. 
government can support developing countries in each of the 
World Plan of Action's subject areas.

Single copies of the draft U.S. Plan of Action for 
Nutrition are available from Jay Hirschman, Center for 
Nutrition Policy and Promotion, USDA, 1120 20th St., N.W.,

CALIFORNIA MARKET OWNERS FINED FOR SELLING, MISBRANDING MEAT 
ADULTERATED WITH SODIUM SULFITE

The U.S. District Court, Central District of California, has 
fined owners of a California meat market over $7,000 for 
selling adulterated and misbranded meat, according to USDA's 
Food Safety and Inspection Service.

Cazares Carniceria, a partnership doing business as Maywood 
Plaza Market, Inc., Riverside, pled guilty to selling meat 
to which sodium sulfite had been added and mixed to conceal 
damage and make the meat "appear of better and greater 
value," FSIS reported.  The partnership was fined $6,200.  
Also fined was another partner, Ignacio Cazares, who pled 
guilty to misbranding meat because it had no labeling saying 
it contained sodium sulfite.  

FSIS also reported that the partnership and Ignacio Cazares 
were placed on two years' probation for the incident, which 
took place in 1993.

Bacteria-Tainted Ice Cream, Decomposed Tuna Steaks Recalled

Potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes bacteria 
prompted Friendly Ice Cream Corp. to recall half-gallon 
containers of its Chocolate Fudge Brownie Yogurt and Purely 
Chocolate Yogurt, according to news wire reports.  The 
company said there have been no reports of illness linked 
with the yogurt, which was manufactured in Troy, Ohio.    

The Massachusetts-based firm said it halted production of 
the frozen yogurt and issued recall of 30,000 containers 
after the Food and Drug Administration detected the 
contamination during routine testing.  The recall affected 
product distributed in Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, 
Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New 
York, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont 
and Virginia.  

A recent FDA Foods Class II enforcement report noted the 
recall of over 14,000 pounds of frozen yellow fin tuna found 
to be decomposed and containing "hazardous levels of 
histamines."  

Recalled by Tysons Foods, Inc., Springdale, Ark., the recall 
involved IQF Tuna Pieces; 4-oz. Tuna Steaks; 6-oz. Tuna 
Steaks; 8-oz. Tuna Steaks, and 4-oz. Tuna Sandwich Cuts 
manufactured by Tyson Seafood Group, Seattle, Wash.  Recall 
of the tuna, distributed nationwide as well as 
internationally, is ongoing, FDA reported.

FDA CLEARS MENADIONE NICOTINAMIDE BISULFITE FOR USE IN 
CHICKEN, TURKEY FEED

In a final rule issued Jan. 2, the Food and Drug 
Administration amended  573.625, menadione nicotinamide 
bisulfite, to provide for the safe use of the food additive, 
1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-methyl-1,4-dioxo-2-naphthalene sulfonic 
acid with 3-pyridine carboxylic acid amine, CAS Reg. No. 
73581-79-0, as a nutritional supplement for the prevention of 
vitamin K deficiency and as a source of supplemental niacin 
in chicken and turkey feed when used at a rate not to exceed 
2 g/t of complete feed.  Vanetta (U.S.A.) Inc. petitioned the 
agency for the regulation (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Aug. 22, 
1994, Page 38).

Animal Drug Sponsor Changes Announced by FDA

Jan. 4, FDA issued final rules amending animal drug sponsor 
regulations to reflect changes in sponsor name and addresses 
and one change in sponsor:

 522.883, etorphine hydrochloride injection, was amended to 
change the sponsor from Fort Dodge Laboratories to Wildlife 
Laboratories, Inc.;

 510 was amended to reflect a change of sponsor name and 
address from American Cyanamid Co. to American Cyanamid, 
Division of American Homes Products, P.O. Box 1339, Fort 
Dodge, Iowa  50501, and to reflect a change of sponsor 
address for TRINADA, Inc. to One Executive Drive, P.O. Box 
1399, Fort Lee, N.J. 07024.

POLYMALEIC ACID AND ITS SODIUM SALT CLEARED FOR USE IN 
PRODUCTION OF BEET AND CANE SUGAR JUICE, LIQUOR

The Food and Drug Administration issued a final rule Jan. 5 
amending  173.45, polymaleic acid and its sodium salt, to 
clear its use to control mineral scale during the production 
of beet and cane sugar juice and liquor at higher levels 
than the maximum currently permitted, as well as to amend 
specifications for the additives.  

Ciba-Geigy, Inc. submitted a petition to FDA for the 
regulations (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Dec. 3, 1990, Page 34) 
containing information on a new manufacturing process which 
resulted in a lower weight-average molecular weight and 
number-average molecular weight than those currently 
permitted.  

FDA issued a tentative final rule May 2, 1995 (See FOOD 
CHEMICAL NEWS, May 8, 1995, Page 22), noting that the 
molecular weight determinations (weight-average in the range 
of 540 to 850; number-average in the range of 520 to 650) 
are to be based on the improved analytical method submitted 
by Ciba-Geigy, entitled "Determinations of Molecular Weight 
Distribution of Poly(Maleic) Acid."  Having received no 
comments or responses to the tentative final rule, FDA 
concluded it should be issued as a final rule.

CDC FOODBORNE DISEASE INVESTIGATION EFFORTS CRIPPLED BY 
BUDGET STALEMATE

The month-long budget stalemate has yet to have long-term 
consequences for the national sentinel site program but has 
crippled the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 
ability to investigate foodborne outbreaks (See FOOD 
CHEMICAL NEWS, July 17, Page 37).

"No doubt the furloughs have made it difficult to keep the 
national surveillance system going," remarked CDC Medical 
Epidemiologist Fred Angulo.  State and local health 
departments are still collecting and reporting surveillance 
data to CDC investigators, but the agency cannot synthesize 
the data without support staff, he explained.  

Travel is severely restricted, so CDC has had to postpone 
site assistance to state officials who have requested help 
from federal disease investigators, he added.  The budget 
crisis means states are not provided with resources to 
determine the magnitude of potential foodborne outbreaks.

"Fortunately, nothing major has happened," Angulo said, 
warning that the government shutdown could place CDC 
officials in a difficult situation if there were another 
deadly outbreak such as the Hanta Virus.  "How would we 
respond when we have no support?" Angulo said.

Another key area where disease control officials are 
crippled is laboratory support.  With CDC's reference 
laboratory closed, federal officials are unable to analyze 
difficult case samples forwarded by state health 
departments.  These samples are checked against the federal 
laboratory's large specimen collection.  "We are the only 
lab in the country that does this," Angelo noted.

While CDC has not been able to synthesize data from the 
national sentinel site program, a multi-agency effort to 
chart foodborne disease trends, the schedule is not likely 
to slip, CDC's Angulo predicted.  

Since the objective of the program is not to respond to 
daily outbreaks but to record long-term trends, the 
furloughs are expected to have only a short-term impact.  
The information is still being forwarded to CDC and, once 
the government budget battle is over, the data can be "run 
through computers," he explained.  

"We've been unable to compile information and look at it," 
he said.  "But when the furlough ends, we will be on the 
same schedule."

HHS Moves to Shore Up Health Statistics Branch

Meanwhile, CDC Director David Satcher was told Dec. 13 that 
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services would be 
designating a "consolidated health statistics entity" to 
strengthen and coordinate general-purpose health surveys 
throughout HHS.

HHS Secretary Donna Shalala said the new effort will create 
a stronger National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) 
while keeping the agency within CDC.  Shalala stressed that 
the new effort must continue to be objective and neutral in 
providing the foundation for health policy. 

Among the changes, Shalala plans to strengthen the role of 
NCHS director, expand NCHS's role in HHS data policy and 
provide the agency with greater independence and "a greater 
ability for NCHS to assume responsibility for the integrity, 
quality and efficiency of HHS statistics effort."

Shalala said she plans to review the changes in two years 
and assess whether NCHS should stay in CDC in meeting 
statistics objectives.  ((6FCN 4612, 35 pages, $13)

DIETARY GUIDELINES VIRTUALLY UNCHANGED FROM ADVISORY PANEL'S 
RECOMMENDATIONS

The fourth edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 
unveiled last week as the "gold standard for good nutrition 
and health," is virtually unchanged from the draft prepared 
this summer by the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee 
(See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Aug. 28, Page 38).  

The guidelines for the first time include information on 
physical activity and dieting, vegetarian diets and 
recommendations that adults maintain their body weight as 
they age.  They also include an expanded section on grains, 
fruits and vegetables.

The guidelines, last issued in 1990, were generally praised 
by industry and consumer groups.  However, the American 
Frozen Food Institute said the guidelines mislead consumers 
by suggesting that eating cooked or raw vegetables is the 
only way to obtain proper vegetable servings.  "[T]his 
language omits other categories of vegetable products, such 
as frozen," the group said.

In the only reference to frozen foods, the guidelines state, 
"The availability of fresh fruits and vegetables varies by 
season and region of the country, but frozen and canned 
fruits and vegetables ensure a plentiful supply of these 
healthful foods throughout the year." 

Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala stressed 
that the guidelines reflect an increased understanding of 
the role of physical activity in maintaining an adequate 
diet.  "Diet and exercise are the twin engines that can 
carry you on the road to good health," she said at a Jan. 2 
news conference.

Baltimore Researchers Find Weight Loss Is More Effective 
than Exercise in Reducing CHD in Middle-aged and Older 
Overweight Men

Several recent studies published in prominent medical 
journals have examined the effects of weight loss and 
aerobic activity on heart disease and other health 
conditions.

Weight loss proved more effective in improving coronary 
artery disease profiles than exercise did in a group of 170 
obese middle-aged and older men, a group of Baltimore-based 
gerontology experts led by physician Leslie Katzel of the 
University of Maryland School of Medicine noted in a study 
published in the Dec. 27 Journal of the American Medical 
Association.  The scientists set out to compare the effects 
of weight loss vs. aerobic exercise training on CAD risk 
factors in healthy, sedentary, obese, middle-aged and older 
men.  Ninety-seven percent of the study subjects were white.

Seventy-three subjects started a nine-month, diet-induced 
weight loss program; another 71 an aerobic exercise program, 
and 26 served as a control group.  The "controls" were 
instructed not to lose weight or change their diets or level 
of physical activity for nine months.  During the test time 
period, dropouts affected each group  -- 44 finished the 
weight-loss program, 49 finished the aerobic program and 18 
controls completed their assignment.  All original test 

subjects were instructed for three months in the principles 
of an isoenergetic American Heart Association phase I diet 
before the study began.

Study results showed that "weight loss significantly 
improves lipoprotein concentrations, glucose tolerance, 
postprandial insulin levels and blood pressure levels, 
whereas aerobic exercise training in the absence of weight 
loss training has substantially less beneficial effects on 
these parameters," Katzel et al. noted, adding:  "This 
suggests that weight loss should be an integral part of 
interventions to reduce CAD risk in obese, middle-aged and 
older individuals."

In an editorial in the JAMA issue, physician William Hazzard 
of the Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Wake Forest 
University, Winston-Salem, N.C., noted that "the most 
encouraging news from this study is that carefully 
supervised weight loss achieved through reduced energy 
intake ... can significantly reduce blood pressure, fasting 
glucose levels (and improve oral glucose tolerance), 
triglycerides and low density lipoprotein cholesterol 
levels, all serving to improve CAD profiles.  Correlational 
analyses suggested that the reduction in fat mass achieved 
was central to these changes."

The study by Katzel et al. also "forms another link in the 
chain of evidence pointing toward weight control as a 
principal feature of a successful preventive strategy" for 
slowing the negative health effects often felt by aging 
Americans, Hazzard noted.  Successful aging, or preventive 
gerontology, has as its cardinal principle "the discovery of 
synergistic strategies or common pathways to preserving 
health and promoting health longevity," he said, adding:

"This study further legitimizes the pathogenetic sequence 
that has underlain our advice to aging Americans -- i.e., 
sedentary behavior begets central adiposity begets insulin 
resistance begets hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, 
increased LDL concentrations, decreased HDL concentrations 
and hypertension.  ... However, as demonstrated in this 
study, weight loss reverses this cascade."

Noncentral Obesity, While Less Serious than Central Obesity, 
Still Has Major Health Effects:  Manitoba Researchers

While central obesity, which is characterized by fat 
concentrated in the upper body and high waist-to-hip ratios 
(WHR), is considered the most potentially health-adverse 
type of obesity, Canadian researchers who published a study 
in the same JAMA issue are concerned that people who are 
noncentrally obese are not aware that their condition also 
is likely to be bad for their health.  The scientists 
defined noncentrally obese people as being overall obese but 
with low WHR.

A representative sample of 2,792 adult residents of 
Manitoba, Canada, aged 18 to 74, were interviewed for the 
Manitoba Heart Health Survey.  Of that group, 2,339 
underwent clinical examinations.  Blood pressure, fasting 
plasma glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high 
density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein measurements 
were compared with body mass index (BMI) and WHR.

The Manitoba survey was part of a national effort to 
estimate the prevalence and distribution patterns of 
cardiovascular risk factors and assess the level of 
knowledge regarding cardiovascular health among Canadians.  
In conducting the survey, physician T. Kue Young and 
colleague Dale Gelskey of the Faculty of Medicine, 
University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, found that noncentral 
obesity is not metabolically benign.  BMI as an overall 
measure of obesity is as important as, and sometimes more 
important than, WHR in predicting metabolic effects."

Noncentral obesity is associated with a more unfavorable 
profile of blood pressure, plasma lipids and glucose 
compared with the nonobese, the researchers noted.  The 
Manitoba findings were similar to those from a study on male 
Japanese urban workers, among whom both BMI and WHR were 
associated with blood pressure, total cholesterol and HDL.

"There was a gradation in mean systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure between the nonobese, the noncentrally obese and 
the centrally obese," Young and Gelskey said, adding:  
"While WHR was the stronger predictor than BMI for systolic 
blood pressure, the reverse was true for diastolic blood 
pressure. ... Our data relating to BMI and WHR are relevant 
to the design and implementation of health education and 
promotion.  Participants of risk assessment programs who are 
identified as noncentrally obese should still be offered 
appropriate nutritional and behavioral counseling for weight 
control, since this type of obesity is associated with 
significant metabolic effects, although of a reduced 
magnitude than central obesity."

JAMA Contributors Disagree on the Possibility that Blood 
Cholesterol-lowering Drugs May Contribute to Cancer

Researchers/physicians Thomas Newman and Stephen Hulley of 
the School of Medicine, University of California, San 
Francisco, concluded in a "special communication" in the 
Jan. 3 JAMA that, after a literature review of the findings 
and implications of rodent carcinogenicity linked to lipid-
lowering drugs, "the results of experiments in animals and 
humans suggest that lipid-lowering drug treatment, 
especially with the fibrates and statins, should be avoided 
except in patients at high short-term risk of coronary heart 
disease."  They added that "most cholesterol-lowering drugs 
cause or promote cancer in rodents."

They caution, however, that extrapolation of this evidence 
of carcinogenesis from rodents to humans is an uncertain 
process, requiring longer-term clinical trials and careful 
postmarketing surveillance during the next several decades.

Two physicians/researchers from the University of Arizona 
School of Medicine in Tucson disagreed with Newman and 
Hulley's findings, noting in a JAMA commentary in the same 
issue that "Newman and Hulley speculate that some classes of 
lipid-lowering drugs are more likely to cause cancer than 
others.  This speculation overlooks the fact that dietary 
treatment [used to lower lipids] has been reported to have 
the same apparent impact on cancer mortality as drug 
therapy.  If there is a relationship between treatment of 
elevated cholesterol levels and cancer, the critical factor 
would have to be lowering cholesterol levels, not the 
specific drug selected for therapy."

James Dalen and William Dalton noted that they agreed with 
Newman and Hulley that all drugs should be subjected to 
safety monitoring before and after their introduction to 
clinical use.  But they added:  "We do not agree that a 20-
year randomized clinical trial is feasible or necessary."

The Arizona doctors said that Newman and Hulley "have not 
presented convincing evidence that cholesterol lowering by 
diet or drugs increases the risk of cancer death.  Their 
frequently reported recommendations that screening for and 
treatment of high cholesterol should be limited to those 
patients who are at greatest risk of CHD death, i.e., those 
with established CHD, might be supported by cost 
considerations but cannot be supported on the basis of 
safety or the risk of cancer."

Primary prevention of CHD should remain an important public-
health priority, Dalen and Dalton said, but deciding "the 
appropriate age to begin screening and treatment requires 
further discussion and careful consideration of the costs.  
We hope the National Cholesterol Education Program will 
address these issues in their future meetings."

Long-term Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy Does Not Halt 
Weight Gain, Fat Distribution

Menopause has been associated with increases in upper body 
(android) fat distribution, researchers Donna Kritz-
Silverstein and Elizabeth Barrett-Connor of the Department 
of Family and Preventive Medicine, University of California 
in San Diego, noted in the Jan. 3 JAMA, and they set out to 
see if such weight gain and distribution occurred in women 
taking hormone replacement therapy at the same rate as it 
occurred in women not taking HRT.

They reported the results of a 15-year cohort study of 671 
women aged 65 to 94 who lived in Rancho Bernardo, Calif.  
The women fell into three groups  -- those who had never used 
hormone replacement therapy (194), those who used HRT 
intermittently (331), and those who used HRT continuously 
from the start of the study (from 1972 to 1974, ending with 
follow-up clinic visits between 1988 and 1991).

After adjustment for potentially confounding covariates, 
"there were no significant differences between estrogen 
users and nonusers in BMI at follow-up, change in weight or 
BMI between baseline and follow-up, or WHR or fat mass at 
follow-up," Kritz-Silverstein and Barrett-Connor said.

The researchers noted that many factors other than 
menopausal status are related to the prevalence of obesity 
and fat distribution, which varies substantially by ethnic 
and socioeconomic group.  The Rancho Bernardo subjects were 
white, relatively well-educated and at baseline leaner on 
average than the U.S. population, Kritz-Silverstein and 
Barrett-Connor said, adding:  "Therefore, these findings may 
not be generalizable to populations consisting of other 
racial, ethnic or socioeconomic groups."

Studies Look at Adult Alcohol Consumption's Role in Adult 
Respiratory Health, Children's Cancer 

A group of researchers led by physician Mark Moss of the 
Department of Medicine, Denver General Hospital, looked at 
the effect of chronic alcohol abuse on the incidence of 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and in-hospital 
mortality.  Their results, published in the Jan. 3 JAMA, 
showed that a prior history of chronic alcohol abuse 
"increases the risk of developing ARDS in critically ill 
patients with an identified at-risk diagnosis."

There are seven diagnoses that have been defined as causing 
a patient to be at risk for the development of ARDS:  
sepsis, severe pancreatitis, hyper-transfusion, witnessed 
aspiration of gastric contents, abdominal trauma, chest 
trauma and multiple fractures, Moss et al. noted.  They had 
a total of 351 consecutive patients enrolled in their study 
between 1986 and 1993, with the largest group being white 
males.

ARDS is associated with a mortality rate of 40% to 60%, Moss 
et al. noted, and they hope that their results "may be 
useful in the earlier and more accurate identification of 
patients at high risk for developing ARDS."  No specific 
therapy currently exists for treating ARDS, but people at 
high risk for the syndrome might benefit from the early use 
of respiratory and cardiovascular monitoring devices and 
other forms of intensive care unit  technology, the 
researchers said, adding:  "Furthermore, the identification 
of additional risk factors for the development or ARDS could 
yield new insights into the pathophysiology of the 
syndrome."

The use of alcoholic beverages "poses a serious health 
problem for the American society," Moss et al. noted, adding 
that in 1985, an estimated 10.6 million Americans were 
dependent on alcohol, and an additional 7.3 million 
experienced some negative sociological consequences of 
alcohol abuse.  The National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and 
Alcoholism "has estimated that alcohol-related problems cost 
our society $117 billion in 1983, and this figure has likely 
increased over the past decade."  

Meanwhile, an evaluation of data from a Children's Cancer 
Group case-control study was conducted by a group of 
researchers led by Xiao-Ou Shu and Julie Ross of the 
Division of Pediatric Epidemiology/Clinical Research, 
University of Minnesota, Minneapolis."  The conclusions 
reached by Shu et al., and published in the Jan. 3 edition 
of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, were that 
maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy increases the 
risk of infant leukemia, especially acute myeloid leukemias 
(AML), while maternal smoking does not elevate risk for 
either AML or acute lymphoid leukemias (ALL).  The 
implication is that "in utero exposure to alcohol may 
contribute to leukemogenesis involving myeloid cells."

Paternal alcohol consumption did not confer an increased 
risk of infant leukemia, but paternal smoking one month 
prior to pregnancy was related to an elevated risk of ALL 
(OR = 1.56 and 95% CI = 1.03-3.26).

In the Children's Cancer Group study, 302 leukemia cases 
(203 ALLs, 88 AMLs and 11 other leukemia types) were 
diagnosed in children 18 months of age and younger, and 558 
individually matched, regional controls were included in the 
analysis.  Information about parental alcohol consumption 
and smoking behavior during pregnancy and the month prior to 
it was collected by telephone. 

Future studies should focus on the evaluation of the effect 
of timing of alcohol consumption, morphology-specific 
associations and interaction between alcohol consumption and 
other environmental exposures, Shu et al. noted.  Studies of 
biologic mechanisms for alcohol exposure during pregnancy 
and infant leukemia are also warranted, they said.

FUTURE FSIS INSPECTION SYSTEM TO BE DEVELOPED BEGINNING WITH 
FEDERAL REGISTER NOTICE, PUBLIC MEETING:  TAYLOR

USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service will begin a 
public process soon to determine how the agency will use its 
inspection resources under a HACCP-based inspection system, 
acting Under Secretary for Food Safety Michael Taylor told 
FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS in an interview last week (See FOOD 
CHEMICAL NEWS, Dec. 18, Page 29).

"We've begun talking informally with constituencies about a 
process through which we would develop alternative modes of 
deploying our inspection resources both within plants and 
downstream, during transportation, distribution and retail," 
Taylor said, adding that the agency "would then pilot test 
and gather data to demonstrate that these alternative modes 
are better from a food safety standpoint.  Our goal here is 
not to save money or to reduce the resources we apply to 
this oversight, but to improve food safety by redeploying 
our resources.  We aren't going to make any changes in our 
inspection program unless we are confident that it will work 
to improve food safety."

Taylor said the process will begin "in the next month or so" 
with a Federal Register notice announcing a public meeting 
"and other opportunities for people to help design the 
pilots."  The data from the pilots "will be made available 
in a way that people can participate in evaluating what 
we've learned" so the agency gets "the broadest possible 
input into modernizing how we use our inspection resources," 
Taylor said.

The agency has been plagued by a shortage of inspectors and 
a budget shortfall that has stretched resources thin.  At 
the same time, Taylor has pledged to expand the agency's 
inspection oversight as part of a farm-to-table food safety 
system, and FSIS inspectors are also expected to perform 
additional monitoring and verification duties under HACCP.  
Figuring out how to reconcile all that was one of the main 
charges of the agency's "top-to-bottom" review (See FOOD 
CHEMICAL NEWS, Sept. 11, Pages 4, 7 and 27).

Reinventing Inspection Central to New Strategy

" ...  We have a new framework, a HACCP framework, for the 
plants we inspect, which will require new tasks being 
performed by our inspectors; we also have a farm-to-table 
strategy that says there are going to be roles for FSIS at 
the transportation stage, distribution, and perhaps greater 
involvement in the retail level," Taylor said, adding, "So 
we've got new roles and responsibilities, we've got to keep 
achieving what we've achieved in the past, because what 
we've done in the past is valuable, but with all that, we're 
not likely to get significant new resources to do this job.  
So it's very clear and very central to our new strategy that 
we reinvent inspection itself."

How the agency carries out its statutory mandate of carcass-
by-carcass inspection is likely to be central to the debate.  
One agency plan would replace the current two to three line 
inspectors in broiler plants with one "zone" inspector, with 
plant employees performing sorting tasks (See FOOD CHEMICAL 
NEWS, Dec. 25, Page 53).  Agency officials have also 
discussed eliminating one of the inspection points of head, 
viscera or rail, and one top-to-bottom team recommended 
requiring plants to present only "normal" animals for 
inspection. 

"There's a lot of work that's gone on to begin to develop 
some possible alternative modes of inspection, and certainly 
looking at alternative ways to carry out the carcass-by-
carcass mandate would be part of an overall alternative," 
Taylor said, adding, "We wouldn't be looking at that in 
isolation from how we're overseeing HACCP within that plant 
or how we're inspecting downstream from that plant.  But 
there's no question, going back to the National Academy of 
Sciences' report on a risk assessment approach to poultry 
inspection (1987), that there are opportunities to still 
achieve the very important consumer protection objectives of 
the current system of inspection but then make better use of 
our inspectors in addressing higher-priority food safety 
issues.  We're not wed to any particular alternative. ... We 
plan to lay out some possibilities in the Federal Register 
and the public meeting and have a public discussion about 
them."

Taylor was sympathetic to the concerns of the inspectors' 
union, the National Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals, 
which is likely to be a formidable obstacle to change in the 
current inspection system.  "Everybody knows that we need to 
improve the way we do our job and use our resources and I 
think everyone is also rightfully concerned that we make 
these changes in a way that really will make things better," 
Taylor said, adding, "It's not change for change's sake.  
Our employees, the industry community, the consumer 
community, the scientific community all have a legitimate 
set of interests and concerns that we need to consider and 
take full advantage of, and we're going to have a process 
that does that.  It's a very important undertaking, but it's 
very central to the success of the food safety initiative."

Reorganization Plan to Go to Glickman This Week; Reinventing 
Government Discussed

Taylor also said that the agency's reorganization plan will 
formally go to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman this week.  
Details on the plan, which appeared in FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS in 
December, will likely be made available this week (See FOOD 
CHEMICAL NEWS, Dec. 11, Page 5).  Taylor said the plan is a 
"sweeping reorganization aimed not at downsizing the agency 
but at making the best possible use of all the resources we 
have both in the field and in headquarters.  It will be a 
reorganization that is in line with our HACCP, our farm-to-
table food safety strategy."

Taylor made his comments as the agency published several 
documents as part of USDA's reinventing food safety 
initiative (See stories, Pages 18 and 25).  A National 
Performance Review report on current and future USDA and FDA 
food safety initiatives is expected to be released today.

Taylor said the "focal point" of the four FSIS documents was 
an advance notice of proposed rulemaking laying out the 
agency's regulatory reform strategy and listing regulations 
to be revised or eliminated to conform with HACCP.  "I know 
this has been a concern of a number of constituencies, 
particularly industry, that we not simply layer HACCP on top 
of the existing system," Taylor said, adding, "We are very 
committed to having a single integrated inspection that's 
centered around HACCP.  For HACCP to be successful, we have 
to very thoroughly review and reform our existing 
regulations."

Taylor said the regulatory review, reinventing inspection 
and the reorganization are all part of the agency's 
reinventing itself as it moves to a HACCP-based inspection 
system.  "In order to make HACCP work, we need to change 
FSIS in a very fundamental way," he said.

Taylor reiterated his commitment to make existing regulations 
compatible with HACCP before plants are required to implement 
HACCP.  Taylor said the agency is conducting a "page-by-page 
review" of existing regulations.  The initiative "goes beyond 
those that relate to safety and thus to HACCP to include all 
of our labeling regulations, our standards of identity, all of 
our prior approval systems for labeling, equipment, 
facilities.  There are a significant number of rulemaking 
initiatives coming along that not only support our HACCP 
initiative but are part of the president's regulatory reform 
and reinvention of government."

Two published proposals would eliminate duplicative review of 
ingredients with FDA and establish a "generic amendment that 
would permit nutritionally improved standardized foods to be 
sold under a standardized name," Taylor said.  A final rule 
published the same day (Dec. 29) streamlined the prior label 
approval process.

Other "very significant proposals" are forthcoming that 
would eliminate prior approval of facilities, equipment and 
blueprints and establish a performance standard for cooked 
meat and poultry products, Taylor said.  A "very good draft" 
of an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on 
transportation, being done in concert with FDA, has been 
completed and will be published in the "next couple months," 
Taylor said.

The agency is also moving ahead on the issue of carcass 
washing versus trimming after an October public meeting on 
the issue (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Oct. 30, Page 31).  "That 
was a good discussion of that issue and we have a lot of 
information to consider," Taylor said, adding, "We have data 
from the steam-vacuum trials that are very relevant to this 
issue, and we intend to take a next step on that issue and 
we're working on it."

Despite the frenzy of activity at FSIS, rumors have 
persisted that Taylor will depart with the publication of a 
final HACCP rule.  Taylor said the rumors are untrue.  "I've 
heard the rumors but there's absolutely nothing to it," he 
said, adding, "We've got a lot of work to do."

"We're all very busy but we've got a lot of very capable, 
committed people working very hard to get this done," he 
said, adding, "It is amazing to me how much is being 
produced.  It's a heroic effort that employees here are 
making."

BRIEF NOTES

The Produce Marketing Association on Dec. 22 asked the 
Federal Trade Commission to investigate an advertisement in 
the Dec. 11 issue of Supermarket News by Food & Water, Inc.  
PMA charged that the ad, which stated that pesticide 
residues on produce kill more Americans than assault weapons 
(See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Dec. 18, Page 45), are unfair and 
deceptive.  PMA asked the FTC to issue a cease-and-desist 
order against the ad as well as statements by Food & Water 
that produce treated with agricultural chemicals in 
compliance with government regulations is unsafe. 

The Food Safety and Inspection Service Dec. 29 issued a 
final rule that expands the types of labeling that are 
authorized for use on meat and poultry in both official U.S. 
establishments and certified foreign establishments.  The 
rule is said to eliminate unnecessary duplication in the 
labeling system, and is part of the Reinventing Government 
proposal (See related stories, Pages 18 and 25).  The 
effective date of the rule is July 1.

FSIS Dec. 29 also published another Reinventing Government 
proposed rule that would give definitions of meat and 
poultry products that have been altered due to their 
nutritional content (i.e., "fat free," "low fat," "light").  
Comments on the proposal are due Feb. 27, and questions 
should be addressed to Charles Edwards, 202-254-2565.

Egg quality assurance and the end of the federal Salmonella 
program were the subjects of two recent letters.  On Nov. 
20, Rep. Joe Skeen (R-N.M.), chairman of the Appropriations 
subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and 
Drug Administration and related agencies, asked for "an 
appropriate" amount of federal assistance to be given to the 
Salmonella enteritidis program in 1996 (the budget for which 
has been entirely cut) to allow for a smooth transition from 
a federal program to a state-industry program.  William 
Bell, executive director of the New England Poultry 
Association, wrote to Michael Taylor, USDA acting under 
secretary for food safety, Dec. 13, asking that FSIS 
employee and SE program worker Sheila Foster be funded 
through June to help train state egg-grading personnel to 
act as SE control monitors.

FSIS will be inviting the American Association of Meat 
Processors, the Eastern Meat Packers Association and other 
industry groups to discuss the inspector harassment issue.  
The meeting probably will be held this month in Washington, 
AAMP said Jan. 1 (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Nov. 13, Page 8).

FSIS Dec. 1 allowed Venta de Especialidades Quimicas S.A., a 
Spanish firm, the right to allow the use of a blend of 
carrageenan (70%), xanthan gum (15%) and locust bean gum 
(15%) as a binder mix injected in water-added hams to 
prevent purging of the brine solution.  A letter to the firm 
said FSIS anticipated initiating rulemaking on the subject 
shortly (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Oct. 2, Page 9).

Food & Water, Inc. is planning a Jan. 23 press conference in 
Washington at which Samuel Epstein of the University of 
Illinois will present new research on the health risks of 
dairy products from cows treated with bovine somatotropin.

George Giddings died suddenly Dec. 24, according to 
Isomedix, Whippany, N.J.  Giddings was a consultant to 
Isomedix, and helped prepare the petition, now under 
consideration by the Department of Agriculture, seeking 
approval of irradiation of beef.

The "Seafood HACCP Road Show," a series of seminars 
explaining the recently published final rule, has a couple 
of tentative dates lined up for this winter.  Put on by 
FDA's Office of Seafood, the road show hopes to hit the 
highway in February, with a meeting held before, after or 
during the Feb. 18-21 Pacific Fisheries Technologists 
conference in San Diego, Calif.  Also on the agenda are as-
yet-unscheduled seminars in New Orleans and Baltimore and 
one coinciding with the March 12-14 Boston Seafood Show, an 
FDA-er said last week.  Funds permitting, the road show may 
also get to Hawaii, the FDA-er noted, because regulators and 
industry there complained about the difficulty they had 
getting to any of the Pacific Coast meetings of FDA's 
earlier series of informational seminars about the seafood 
HACCP proposed rule (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Jan. 31, 1994, 
Page 16).  For more definite information about the upcoming 
seminars, call the Office of Seafood at 202-418-3133 in 
early February.

None of the 186 samples of domestic and imported animal 
feeds tested for pesticide residues by FDA's Center for 
Veterinary Medicine in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 
1995 (July 1 to Sept. 30, 1995) were considered to have 
exceeded regulatory guidances, according to a Dec. 26 
memorandum to regional food and drug directors, district 
directors and state feed control officials from Randy 
Arbaugh, Division of Federal-State Relations, Office of 
Regional Operations, of FDA's Office of Regulatory Affairs.  
Tests conducted by FDA regional offices found a variety of 
pesticides, including diazinon, chlorpyrifos-methyl, 
chlorpyrifos-ethyl, malathion, pirimiphos-methyl, diazinon, 
DDT, lindane, fonofos and gardona.  ((6FCN 4613, 8 pages,

The Food and Drug Administration announced Jan. 4 the 
availability of a report prepared by the Center for 
Veterinary Medicine's Fluoroquinolone Working Group.  
Addressing issues related to the center's approval of 
fluoroquinolone antimicrobial drugs in food animals, the 
report was written to respond to concerns about "increased 
 ... resistance in zoonotic organisms" in food animals that 
are transmitted to humans and cause disease.  The report, 
which will be featured in a full-length story next week, is 
available by contacting the Communication and Education 
Branch, CVM, 7500 Standish Place, Rockville, Md. 20855.

A test being developed by Cornell University researchers 
with funding from the New York Center for Advanced 
Technology in Biotechnology is aimed at being a more 
sensitive and reliable method to test municipal water 
supplies for Cryptosporidium parvum, the university 
reported.  Cornell also said that researchers at the 
university have worked out a way of using carbonation to 
keep dairy products fresh and fortified for months.

The Lancet reported in its Dec. 23/30 issue that 
Streptococcus suis is a threat to pig farmers and abattoir 
workers.  The study found that the pathogen can enter the 
body through cuts or cracks in the skin surface, and can 
lead to fulminate sepsis and a type of meningitis, among 
other serious diseases.  "Infection could possibly be 
prevented by prompt disinfection of skin injuries of persons 
at risk," the article said.

Caroline Smith DeWaal of the Center for Science in the 
Public Interest said she did not mean to imply that only 
restaurants are responsible for food safety (See FOOD 
CHEMICAL NEWS, Dec. 25, Page 23).  "The bottom line is that 
-- from farm to table -- we all need to share responsibility 
for food safety.  My remarks at the USDA conference are 
clear that neither consumers nor restaurants have sole 
responsibility for ensuring the safety of food products," 
DeWaal wrote the National Restaurant Association's Robert 
Harrington.  Harrington had expressed concern about her use 
of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.

Tracking Foodborne Pathogens from Farm to Table:  Data Needs 
to Evaluate Control Options is available from USDA's 
Economic Research Service.  The proceedings cover the 
meeting held on the issue last January (See FOOD CHEMICAL 
NEWS, Jan. 16, Page 38).  It costs $18; call  1-800-999-6779

Some of the active compounds in Sho-saiko-to, a Chinese 
herbal medicine, may have antimutagenic effects, according 
to a paper by Masanori Ohtsuka and colleagues published in 
the December Japanese Journal of Cancer Research.

Some noted food writers and scientists don't want olestra 
used, according to an article in the Jan. 3 New York Times.  
Marion Nestle, chairwoman of the department of nutrition and 
food studies, New York University, and Clark Wolf, a New 
York restaurant consultant, both listed the product as one 
of the things they would "best like forgotten."  Others said 
that they wanted a return to fatty foods (eaten in 
moderation) instead of less tasty low-fat substitutes.

Conjugated lineoleic acid, a polyunsaturated fat found in 
red meat, has been proven to inhibit breast and skin cancer 
in three rodent studies, according to the November/December 
issue of the 1995 Meat Board Research/Meat Science Update.

Butter Flavor Derived
from Lactic Acid

A pilot-scale catalytic reactor system will be used by Natura, Inc.
(3900 Collins Rd., Suite 1007, Lansing, MI 48910; Tel: 517/336-
4635) for the natural processing of 2,3-pentanedione from lactic
acid. 2,3-Pentanedione is used as the buttery flavor in popcorn and
other food products.  According to Chemical Marketing Reporter, an
estimated 15,000 lbs. of 2,3-pentanedione are annually consumed
worldwide in food related applications.

The Dept. of Agriculture (USDA) awarded $203,000 to Natura in a
second-phase grant to develop a large-scale catalytic reaction
process and to improve product purity and yields of natural 2,3-
pentanedione.  The large-scale process should result in lower
prices for the product.  At present, the natural form costs $60-
$80/lb., while the synthetic version costs $50-$60/lb.

When FIN first spoke with Prashant Kokitkar, the principal
investigator in the development of the catalytic reactor system, he
said the pilot-scale reactor was "nearly at the end of the
construction stage" and that he expected to have the system running
"within a week."  The commercial-scale reactor should be
operational within one year.  Kokitkar explained that the one-step
process provides a shortcut in manufacturing, thereby offering
time-saving and cost-cutting advantages over the other two
approaches used by industry currently.

Other advantages are that the process is environmentally friendly
and that the starting material is lactic acid, derived from the
fermentation of corn. The commercial methods of 2,3-pentanedione
production either extract the chemical from dairy products or start
with petroleum in a multi-step, expensive process.

While a post-doc at Michigan State University (MSU), Kokitkar was
part of the group that invented the process.  Dennis Miller of
MSU's Dept. of Chemical Engineering and Ned Jackson of the Dept. of
Chemistry were also part of the team.  MSU has filed a patent for
the process, which will be licensed to Natura.  A contractor will
manufacture the product for Natura.  Kokitkar points out that the
chemical produced by this method has been tested and found to be
"nature-identical."  The investigator adds that in addition to
being a valuable food ingredient, 2,3-pentanedione has the
potential to be used as a starting material for other flavor
compounds.

Natura is a spin-off company of the Michigan Biotechnology
Institute, located at the same address.  Natura, which was
incorporated in December 1994, focuses on the production of natural
food flavors and ingredients.  Ron Carlotti, Natura's president,
explained that the young company is "looking for prospective
investors to get through the start-up phase."  Natura is seeking
potential customers, in both food and non-food areas.  In addition
to 2,3-pentanedione, products under development for the food
industry include a salty flavor and a sugar bulking agent.  A
biophosphorescent material has potential applications outside the
food industry.

Honey Makes Fat
Free Chips Crisper

Fat-free potato chips can be made with microwave technology, but
the appearance and texture of these chips does not compare with
commercial chips.  Scientists in California have found that
including honey in the process can enhance the color and crispness
of microwavable fat-free potato chips.  This research project was
part of a larger effort to develop healthy snack foods.

In the process, sliced potatoes are soaked in brine and honey,
drained, and then sent through a microwave tunnel.  The scientists
investigated 27 combinations of study variables--type of honey,
concentration of honey in solution, and duration of exposure to the
microwave oven.  Liquid honey, drum-dried honey, and a mixture of
the two were investigated.  The level of concentration was 4%, 5%,
or 6% honey.  For each trial, the exposure time variable was set at
4.45, 9.86, or 12.59 min.  Color and texture were measured
quantitatively with a chromasensor and a texturometer,
respectively.

The brownest chips resulted from the potatoes soaked in drum-dried
honey, which contained 70% honey solids.  The 6% honey solution was
found the best for browning.  Not surprisingly, the darkest chips
also resulted from the longest exposure time to the microwave oven.
The potatoes soaked in 5% honey solution made the crispest chips,
based on the amount of force needed to break the chip.  Also, the
median experimental variable for exposure time made the crispest
chips (9.86 minutes).  After statistical analysis, the authors
concluded that the process variables resulting in the crispest,
brownest fat-free chips were 4% liquid honey solution and an
exposure time of 4.45 min.

Kyros Demetriades, Clarissa Guffey, and Hany M. Khalil (Dept. of
Food Science and Nutrition, California Polytechnic State
University, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407; Tel: 619/756-2852) published
"Evaluating the Role of Honey in Fat-Free Potato Chips" in Food
Technology [49(10): 66-67, 1995].  The article was based on a paper
first presented at the Annual Meeting of the Institute of Food
Technologists, Anaheim, CA, June 3-7, 1995.  The project was funded
by the National Honey Board.

In an interview with FIN, Khalil said that the potato chips "tasted
very good," especially if you desire a chip with more of a potato
taste.  For those who crave the fatty taste of regular chips, they
may need to lower their expectations.  Khalil explained that
switching to reduced fat snack foods means you need to "compromise
a little bit for the health benefits."

Khalil's work focuses on the use of microwave energy in process
development.  In addition to developing potato chips and carrot
chips as snack foods, Khalil currently is devising a microwave
method for reducing microbial content in spices.

Vegetable Fibers
to Resemble Meat

Edmund W. Lusas, Gabriel J. Guzman, and Steven C. Doty of the Food
Protein Research and Development Dept. at Texas A&M University
(College Station, TX 77843-2476; Tel: 409/845-2777, Fax: 409/845-
7244) have patented a method (U.S. 5,437,885) for converting
oilseed protein meal into meat-like fibers.  The fibers can be used
in a product such as beef jerky to provide a more nutritionally
balanced snack food.

The first step of the new process is to mix water with dehulled,
defatted oilseed protein meal, such as that originating from
soybeans.  The mixture is heated at a temperature between 200 and
350F, extruded, coated with edible oil or fat, and extruded again.
Non-spongy fibers with a nonporous texture result. The fibers
resemble glistening, broiled meat fibers.

Lusas explained that when these fibers are worked into beef jerky,
the product looks fresher and has a good appearance.  The objective
of the project was to develop fibers that look shiny, which is why
oil is applied in the last stages of extrusion.

The department is a contract process research and development group
that focuses on oilseed processing.  One of their strengths is oil
extraction, and most of the projects are supported by industry.
Projects include the development of reduced-calorie peanut snacks
and a low-cost texturized soybean product that resembles ground
meat.

Better Cinnamon
Rolls with SFE

The true cinnamon of commerce is prepared from the inner bark of
the tropical tree Cinnamomum zeylanicum, while an inferior product
generically termed "cassia" is obtained from closely related trees
of the same genus. Tests for cinnamon purity and quality control
have previously relied on Soxhlet extraction, solvent extraction at
reflux, or simultaneous steam distillation-solvent extraction, but
three U.S. and British researchers have determined that solvent-
assisted supercritical fluid extraction isolates the essential oils
of true cinnamon and cassia more efficiently for separation and
analysis by series-coupled column gas chromatography.

Kenneth G. Miller, Colin F. Poole (Centre for Analytical Chemistry,
Imperial College, South Kensington, London SW7 2AY, U.K.) and Tina
M.P. Chichila optimized extraction conditions for essential oils
from powdered cinnamon by carbon dioxide at 300 atm and 70C. They
mixed 0.5 g of powdered cinnamon with 4.5 g anhydrous sodium
sulfate and added 1.0 ml acetonitrile at the beginning of
sequential 30 min. static and 30 min. dynamic extraction periods.
They collected the semivolatile essential oils by solvent trapping
in ethyl acetate and analyzed them directly by series-coupled
column gas chromatography after filtration and partial solvent
evaporation.

The authors used a Suprex 200A supercritical fluid chromatograph
that was modified for supercritical fluid extraction. Control
extractions were made from each sample by Soxhlet extraction. The
authors used a Seimens Sichromat-2 dual-oven gas chromatograph
fitted with a split injector and a flame ionization detector. For
gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, they used a 3400 gas
chromatograph equipped with a model 1075 splitless injector
interfaced to a Finnigan MAT Magnum ion tap detector.

Poole reports in Journal of High Resolution Chromatography [18-8,
461-471, 1995] that the three authors identified and quantified 21
compounds in 24 authenticated and retail samples of cinnamon and
cassia. The dominant essence in both cinnamon and cassia is trans-
cinnamaldehyde, which varies in concentration from 0.5-53 mg/g,
with smaller amounts of various aromatic compounds and esters. True
cinnamon and cassia are easily distinguishable by the presence in
cinnamon of eugenol and benzyl benzoate, which are absent or
negligible in cassia. Cassia, in contrast, contains coumarin and
delta-cadinene, which are absent or trace components in cinnamon.

The extractions were slow or incomplete at pressures below 300 atm
and temperatures below 50C. The authors found that solvent-
assisted supercritical fluid extraction was at least equivalent to
Soxhlet in its ability to extract semivolatile compounds from
cinnamon and cassia, and preferable to Soxhlet for general
applications because it gives faster extractions without generating
artifact peaks. Absolute recoveries by supercritical fluid
extraction and Soxhlet were about the same while solvent reflux for
2 hrs. and simultaneous steam distillation/solvent extraction
achieved significantly lower recoveries of many components.

The concentration of cinnamaldehyde is one parameter for judging
the flavor quality of spice, with quality being directly
proportional to concentration. The average cinnamaldehyde
concentration in cassia, however, is actually higher. Principal
component analysis of the 23 samples using the relative composition
of the 12 major semivolatile essences gave a clear distinction
between cinnamon and cassia. The loadings for "principal component
1" are heavily weighted to benzyl benzoate, 2-
methoxycinnamaldehyde, and benzaldehyde as positive coefficients
and coumarin and beta-caryophyllene as negative coefficients for
cinnamon.

High relative concentrations of benzyl anzoate and 2-
methoxycinnamaldehyde are characteristic of cinnamon and high
relative concentrations of coumarin and beta-caryophyllene are
characteristic of cassia. The authors conclude that principal
component 1 effectively discriminates between cinnamon and cassia.
A plot of PC-1 versus PC-2 clearly separates the 24 samples into
two groups of 11 and 13, with all the U.S. cinnamons falling in the
cassia group.

Isothiocyanates Are
Natural Alternative

Although the commercial use of isothiocyanates is limited, Canadian
scientists propose that the natural agents could replace synthetic
preservatives in certain applications of packaged foods.  Their
volatility make them attractive candidates for use in modern
packaging, either with other antimicrobial agents or on their own.
Pascal J. Delaquis and Joe Mazza of the Agriculture and Agri-Food
Canada Research Centre (Summerland, BC V0H 1Z0; Tel: 604/494-7711)
have reviewed the effect of isothiocyanates on microbes.
"Antimicrobial Properties of Isothiocyanates in Food Preservation"
was a peer-reviewed article published in Food Technology
[49(11):73-84, 1995].

Isothiocyanates are found in cruciferous plants, such as
horseradish, cauliflower, mustard, cabbage, turnip, radish,
rapeseed, and Brussels sprouts.  The Romans used mustard seed to
preserve wine and fruit juices.  These sulfur-containing compounds
can be recovered commercially by steam distillation of ground wet
plant material, but synthetic manufacturing processes have been
available since the 1940s.  Isothiocyanates have been used for
military tear gas, pesticides, and industrial purposes.

The molecular structure of isothiocyanates varies.  The generic
molecular formula is R-N=C=S where the R-side group may be methyl
(CH3), allyl (CH2-CH-CH2), or a number of other possible
structures.

Isothiocyanates have been found potent inhibitors of microorganisms
when tested with a variety of fungi, yeasts, and bacteria.  In the
1960s, about 100 natural and synthetic isothiocyanates were tested
for antifungal activity, and it was found that the aromatic
derivatives were the most effective of the natural compounds.  In
the 1990s, Japanese scientists have shown that vapors can inhibit
the growth of several fungi.  At a concentration of 1%, allyl
isothiocyanate can prevent yeast growth in fruit juices.  A review
of the antibacterial studies determined that isothiocyanates are
not as effective at impeding the growth of bacteria as they are
with fungal growth.  Also, certain strains are more resistant to
the bacteriocidal and bacteriostatic effects than others.

Natural extracts of allyl isothiocyanate (CH2-CH-CH2-N=C=S) are
used as a preservative in Japan.  Synthetic forms may be
contaminated with a toxic substance, allyl chloride, which is used
in the manufacturing process.  Allyl isothiocyanate is incorporated
into the packaging material in order to extend the shelf life of
certain foods.

Isothiocyanates are not widely used because the health effects are
unknown.  The findings are mixed regarding toxicity and potential
health benefits.  At least three recent studies show that certain
isothiocyanates may inhibit the development of cancers.  At the
same time, certain kinds are thought to be linked to the
development of goiters through the binding of iodine by the
thiocyanate ion.  Some isothiocyanates are thought to be cytotoxic
or mutagenic.  The data are contradictory.  The authors urge that
more research be conducted in this area, since these compounds
could provide a natural source of preservatives.

Another reason isothiocyanates may not be used widely as food
preservatives is the pungent flavor and odor of these compounds.
Threshold levels range from 8 parts per billion (ppb) for allyl
isothiocyanate to 380 ppb for 3-butenyl isothiocyanate.  But,
antimicrobial activity in foods may be possible with concentrations
below the threshold level in the vapor phase.  Allyl isothiocyanate
is used to control surface growth.  Studies have not been conducted
on the absorption and dissolution of these compounds into food
products.  Delaquis and Mazza urge that more investigations be
conducted to determine the potential of isothiocyanates as food
preservatives.

Covi-Ox Protects
Against Rancidity

Henkel Corp. (5325 S. Ninth Ave., La Grange, IL 60525-3602; Tel:

natural mixed tocopherols to protect foods containing highly
unsaturated oils.  Covi-Ox protects against oxidative rancidity,
which leads to off-odors and off-flavors.  Natural mixed
tocopherols are GRAS (generally regarded as safe) substances and
are approved as a preservative by the Food and Drug Administration
(21 CFR 182.3890).  According to the company, Covi-Ox tocopherols
are the only approved natural fat-soluble antioxidants available.

Since the tocopherol mixture is of low volatility, Covi-Ox can be
added to the food product during high-temperature processing
without losing activity.  By contrast, synthetic antioxidants
usually volatilize at the same high temperatures.  According to
Henkel, Covi-Ox may be used as an antioxidant to protect lecithin,
vegetable and citrus oils, milk fat, cereal, dehydrated potatoes,
meat products, and a long list of other foods or ingredients.

Covi-Ox is available as a water dispersible powder (Covi-Ox T-30P)
and as clear, viscous oils (Covi-Ox T-50 and T-70).  The optimal
level of tocopherols in food products ranges between 0.01% and 0.2%
of the fat or oil content.

Henkel Corp. is one of the top 200 international companies, and its
Fine Chemicals Div. is the leading producer of natural tocopherols.
In addition to Covi-Ox, the Fine Chemicals Div. markets medium
chain triglycerides, whipped topping concentrates, and bread/baking
ingredients.

Rosemary Puts
Pep in Pepperoni

Diversitech, Inc. (2411 NW 41st St., Gainesville, FL 32606-6662;
Tel: 904/377-7071, Fax: 904/377-7073) markets three forms of
Rosemary extract for extending the shelf-life of pepperoni and
other meat products.  The extract stabilizes color and flavor and
retards the oxidation of fat in the meats.

ColorLife Rosemary extracts come in an oil-soluble powder (Rosemary
Powder-P), an oil-soluble liquid (Rosemary Liquid-O), and a water-
dispersible liquid (Rosemary Liquid-W).  The powder may be added to
the meat mix directly or mixed with dry spices or solids.  When
refrigerated and protected from moisture, light, and oxygen, the
powder remains stable for at least two years.

The usage rate is 0.01% to 0.05%.  Liquid-O can be added to the fat
portion of a food, mixed with flavorings and then added to the
food, or diluted with oil and sprayed onto food.  Liquid-W can be
used in sausage, snack flavorings, and soups.  Depending on fat
content, Liquid-O inhibits rancidity at dilutions of 0.02% to
0.10%, while Liquid-W inhibits at dilutions of 0.03% to 0.14%.

Diversitech markets spice blends to the food industry, primarily to
the meat industry.  The company markets ColorLife as a standardized
rosemary extract.  An advantage of this product is its standardized
active ingredients.  Diversitech offers customized blends with
other antioxidants or spices. According to the company, most of the
rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) imported to the U.S. is grown in
Spain, France, and Portugal.  The leaves contain compounds that
stabilize the fats in meat.

FDA Committee
Says Olestra Safe

The fat substitute olestra is undergoing Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) review.  The FDA Food Advisory Committee met
recently and determined that olestra poses no harm as a food
ingredient.  Olestra is the only fat-based fat substitute ever to
undergo federal review in the U.S.  Other fat substitutes are
carbohydrate- or protein-based.

Procter & Gamble Co. (One Procter & Gamble Plaza, P.O. Box 599,
Cincinnati, OH 45201-0599; Tel: 513/983-1100, Fax: 513/983-9369)
first sought approval to use olestra as a food ingredient in 1987.
At that time, the company filed a food additive petition for using
olestra in shortening and cooking oil.  In 1990, the petition was
amended to use olestra as a fat substitute in savory snacks.
Examples of salty or sharp-tasting snacks of interest to the
company are cheese puffs and crackers.

The Advisory Committee discussed the findings of a team of senior
managers from FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition
and FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, who met earlier in 1995.
The team of senior managers reviewed safety data and discussed the
data with experts from academia and federal agencies.  Since the
original petition was filed in 1987, Procter & Gamble has submitted
data from more than 150 investigations on the safety of olestra.

A working group of the Food Advisory Committee reviewed the fat
substitute's chemistry and consumption, toxicology, potential
interference with drug absorption, effects to the digestive system,
labeling, and nutritional effects.  The group decided that the
study questions and data were sufficient, but the vote was not
unanimous for deciding that the data indicated that olestra was
safe for human consumption.  The group recommended that products
made with olestra carry a warning label that the ingredient might
cause intestinal discomfort or might have a laxative effect.
Although no studies showed that olestra has an adverse effect on
the ability to absorb water-soluble vitamins, the committee
recommends that olestra be fortified with vitamins A, D, E, and K.

The full Food Advisory Committee concurred with the findings of the
working group.  The Advisory Committee decided that "a reasonable
certainty exists of no harm" from olestra's proposed food
applications.  The FDA will use this analysis in order to decide on
whether to allow Procter & Gamble to use olestra as a food
ingredient.

Olestra is a fat substitute formed from the combination of sucrose
with fatty acids.  The food ingredient does not liberate calories
because the body cannot metabolize it.  In olestra, the glycerol
molecule present in fat is replaced by sucrose.  And instead of
three fatty acid molecules, olestra has seven or eight.  The fat
substitute is not metabolized because digestive enzymes cannot get
past the fatty acid molecules to access the sucrose center before
olestra exits the digestive tract.

Procter & Gamble reported food and beverage sales of $3.988 billion
in 1995.  Crisco, Jif, Duncan Hines, Folgers, Hawaiian Punch, and
Sunny Delight are examples of its more common household food and
beverage products.

Fatty Acid Polyester
Used in Low-Cal Food

A two-step process prepares saccharide fatty acid polyesters from
a sugar and a reagent containing a fatty acid.  The resulting
polyesters can be used as fat substitutes or low-calorie fats in
foods.

Gerry Hasenhuettl of Kraft General Foods (3 Lakes Dr., Northfield,
IL 60093; Tel: 708/646-7469) invented the process (U.S. Patent
5,440,027).  First, the sugar is partially esterified.  Then, a
reagent containing a fatty acid is used to react with the partially
esterified sugar.  The reagent may be fatty acids, fatty acid
esters, salts of fatty acids, or fatty acid anhydrides.  Saccharide
fatty acid polyesters result from the reaction.

Less carmelization and fewer decomposition reactions are two basic
advantages of using a partially esterified sugar for the reaction.
Also, the reaction system is more homogeneous, and the formation of
low molecular weight ester byproducts is less.

According to Hasenhuettl, these saccharide fatty acid polyesters
would fall into the same category as olestra, a zero-calorie fat
substitute made from sucrose and fatty acids.  Procter & Gamble
(One Procter & Gamble Plaza, P.O. Box 599, Cincinnati, OH 45201-
0599; Tel: 513/983-1100, Fax: 513/983-9369) manufactures olestra
and has petitioned the FDA for approval to use the fat substitute
as an ingredient.

Product Bakes
Moister Cakes

Juan M. Gonzalez-Sanz of the Pillsbury Co. (200 S. 6th St.,
Minneapolis, MN 55402-1464; Tel: 612/330-4741) invented a low-fat
spreadable composition that can be used with baked foods or alone,
as a frosting.   Shortening, starch, a hydrocolloid, an emulsifier,
and a sweetener make up the product.  The starch has a hydrophilic
starch component and a modified hydrophobic starch component.

When used as a frosting, the low-fat composition exhibits enhanced
adhesion.  When used in baked foods, such as cakes, rolls, breads,
biscuits, and pastries, the product increases the moistness. U.S.
Patent 5,439,697 was issued to Pillsbury for this invention.

Proprietary Process
for Peanut Butter

Seabrook Enterprises, Inc. (100 Galleria Pkwy. NW, Suite 580,
Atlanta, GA 30339; Tel: 770/951-0404) now markets a reduced-fat
peanut butter for fillings, coatings, bakery items, nutrition bars,
dairy products, and candy centers.  Only two reduced-fat peanut
butters have been commercialized.  A similar product is the low-fat
peanut spread, which does not contain the minimum level of 90%
peanuts to qualify as peanut butter.

According to Tucker Dodson, Seabrook Enterprise's VP of sales, the
main advantage of Seabrook Enterprise's reduced-fat peanut butter
is that it "has all the same nutritional function with 25% less
fat" than whole-fat peanut butter.  No vitamin or mineral
supplement is added to the all-natural product.  The flavor is more
concentrated, the product is less apt to separate, and the peanut
butter is more heat stable.

About 25-30% of the fat is removed by their proprietary method.  In
1994, the company applied for a patent for the fat-extracting
technology.  Although this product is sold solely as a food
ingredient on the industrial market, the peanut butter is available
for repackaging for retail sale.

Dodson describes the company as a "vertically integrated peanut
shelling and processing company" that is the largest of its kind in
the U.S.  Seabrook Enterprise processes 400 million pounds of
peanuts annually.

Glazing Over
Caramel Corn

Michael L. Jensen and Sara J. Risch of Golden Valley Microwave
Foods, Inc. (7450 Metro Blvd., Edina, MN 55439; Tel: 612/835-6900)
have invented a microwavable mixture for sweetening microwave
popcorn.  The mixture is composed of unpopped popcorn, a sweetening
blend, and a glazing blend.  Salt may also be added to the unpopped
corn.

The sweetening blend is made from an oil and sugar crystals.  The
weight ratio of sweetening blend to unpopped popcorn is between
0.5/1 to 1.5/1.  The oil's melting point is above 115F. The
crystalline sugar has a moisture content less than 2% by weight.

The glazing blend, which is mixed with the unpopped popcorn, is
made from corn syrup (80-90% by weight), oil (10-20% by weight),
and an emulsifier.  As with the oil used for the sweetening blend,
the glazing oil's melting point should be above 115F.

Jensen, a food technologist with Golden Valley Microwave Foods,
told FIN that the method has been used in the past for a marketed
popcorn product.  The work originated in order to eliminate the
second step necessary in making caramel popcorn.  In order to
sweeten the popcorn, a wafer is placed on the cooked popcorn and
melted in a second microwaving step.  Jensen and Risch's invention
eliminates the need for a separate wafer containing sweetener.
Instead, the popcorn is coated with both sweetening and glazing
blends.  The patent may be licensed by companies interested in
using the mixture in their own products.

Systems Bio-Industries
Adds on Aspartame

The NutraSweet Co. (1751 Lake Cook Rd., Deerfield, IL 60015; Tel:
708/940-9800) no longer has exclusive rights to aspartame, and
Systems Bio-Industries (8 Neshaminy Interplex, Suite 213, Trevose,
PA 19053; Tel: 215/638-7801) joins the list of other companies who
have added aspartame to their line of food ingredients.

Aspartame is about 200 times sweeter than table sugar (sucrose).
The artificial sweetener is an ingredient in 500 foods and
beverages, such as yogurt, drink mixes, and carbonated soft drinks.
The product loses sweetness when exposed to heat, moisture, or
alkaline conditions.  Aspartame is made by joining two amino acids-
-aspartic acid and phenylalanine--which are found in natural
proteins.

Aspartame is one of the most widely tested food ingredients.  More
than 100 safety tests were conducted before it was marketed.  The
product was approved in the U.S. in 1981 as an ingredient in
powdered mixes and for use as a tabletop sweetener.  In 1983,
carbonated drinks were added to the list of approved uses. The food
ingredient is marketed in more than 70 countries.  Product names
include NutraSweet, Equal, Spoonful, and Natra Taste.

According to Jim Duffy, account manager, sales and marketing (620
Progress Ave., Waukesha, WI 53186; Tel: 800/654-2396), the company
is an industry leader among food ingredient manufacturers. In
addition to Aspartame 200, they manufactures a variety of food
ingredients and additives, including enzyme-modified dairy
ingredients, gels, fruit preparations, pectins, and natural flavor
systems.  In January 1995, when SKW Trostberg A.G. of Germany
acquired the company, the name was changed to Systems Bio-
Industries from Sanofi Bio-Industries.  The acquisition increased
SKW's total sales to the food industry by $1 billion.

Sugar-Containing
Solutions Softened

A cation exchange resin-based process for softening aqueous
solutions such sugar juice or molasses has been investigated.
Michael Saska of the Louisiana State University (LSU, Chemical
Engineering Dept., Baton Rouge, LA 70803; Tel: 504/388-3327)
reports that the sugar cane and sugar beet industries produce large
quantities of non-crystallizable sugar juice, or sugar factory
molasses.  This molasses has a high sugar content and is treated
to extract the sugars.

Such conventional treatment involves subjecting the molasses to an
ion exclusion chromatography process using a fixed support of a
strong sodium (Na) or potassium (K) cation resin.  The problem is
that magnesium (Mg) and/or calcium (Ca) salts dissolved in the
molasses and, as charged Ca2+ and/or Mg2+ ions, replace the Na+ and
K+ ions during the chromatography operation, reducing the
separating power of the technique.  As a result, the chromatography
operation is interrupted periodically to regenerate the cation
resin.

Regeneration reagent is consumed and productivity is reduced.  One
approach to overcome the problem involves the elimination of the
Ca2+ and/or Mg2+ ions prior to the chromatography step.  Such a
technique also requires the use of a regeneration reagent and has
the additional disadvantage of producing wastewater containing
sugar, reducing the yield from the overall process.

In the new process, the sugar juice is softened by bringing it into
contact with Na+ and/or K+ cation exchange resins in a conventional
manner.  The key to the new technique is the regeneration part of
the process, which makes clever use of one of the liquid effluents
in a sugar factory.  The raffinate generated during the
chromatographic separation and charged with Na+ and/or K+ ions is
normally discarded.  The researchers concentrated the raffinate and
used it to regenerate the resin used in the primary separation.
U.S. Patent 5,443,650 covers the new technique.

Honey Heightens
Taste Perception

Anna Resurreccion and her colleagues at the Dept. of Food Science
at the University of Georgia (Center for Food Safety and Quality
Enhancement, Georgia Station, Griffin, GA 30223; Tel: 770/228-7284;
email: aresurr@gaes.griffin.peachnet.edu) have demonstrated in a
recent study that honey can have an effect on the perception of
sweet, sour, bitter, and salty tastes.  The sensory evaluation
tests were performed by panels of trained evaluators.

The intensity of sweet solutions is enhanced by the addition of
honey.  When 25% honey is added to a 5% sucrose solution, the
sweetness intensity is doubled.  Other solutions, such as 10%
sucrose, are not enhanced to the same degree.  Orange blossom honey
was shown to have the most enhancing power.

Pure solutions of citric acid were used to evaluate honey's effect
on the sourness of solutions.  The sourness intensity rating of a
citric acid solution was decreased from 50 to about 17 by the
addition of 25% honey.  The more sour the solution, the more
pronounced the effect.  A citric acid solution rated at 100 was
reduced to about 28 by the addition of honey.  This study shows
that honey has the ability to increase consumer acceptability of
very sour products, such as citrus beverages, yogurts, and berry-
based products.

Caffeine solutions were used to measure the reduction of bitterness
resulting from the addition of honey.  Orange blossom, wildflower,
and clover honeys were used to evaluate the reduction.  Clover
honey showed the widest margin of difference; the bitterness
intensity plunged from 50 to 3.2.  Food developers could use honey
in order to mask bitterness in certain foods, which can result from
molecular breakdown during processing.

Honey can mask the high saltiness intensity of salt-cured products,
such as ham and bacon.  The panel of evaluators indicated that
adding honey to a sodium chloride solution decreases the salt
intensity score from 50 to about 28.  With a saltier solution, the
score dropped from 150 to about 45 with the addition of honey.

The carbohydrate composition varies between honeys, which might
explain why orange blossom, wildflower, and clover honeys had
slightly different results in this study.  Fructose and glucose are
the main carbohydrates in honey.  In addition to these
monosaccharides, maltose, sucrose, and other oligosaccharides are
found in honey.

In addition to being a sweetener, honey as an ingredient can hold
moisture, can extend shelf-life, can promote color and flavor
development, and can be used as a browning agent or surface coating
in microwavable products.  The National Honey Board Food Technology
Program (P.O. Box 281525, San Francisco, CA 94128-1525; Tel:
800/356-5941) conducts studies on the use of honey in foods.

According to Veronique LaGrange, senior scientist and spokesperson
for the Honey Board (TJP Market Development, 3242 Jones Cr. NW,
Washington, DC 20007; Tel: 202/625-6055), the primary purpose of
the Honey Board Food Technology Program is to "help manufacturers
use honey in their products."  The studies tend to be applications-
oriented for products already in existence.  The program provides
printed documents, in the form of newsletters and research
monographs, and assistance to manufacturers who wish to use honey
in their products.  New ways of using honey, as well as new markets
for honey, are offshoots of the program.

Report Determines
That MSG Is Safe

For most people, ingestion of monosodium glutamate (MSG) does not
pose a problem.  For others, this flavor enhancer can cause
headaches and other unpleasant effects.  The Life Sciences Research
Office of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental
Biology analyzed the adverse reactions people have had to MSG.  The
report was prepared for the Center for Food Safety and Applied
Nutrition of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Free glutamate, in the form of MSG or protein hydrolysates, is used
to enhance flavor.  Currently, MSG must be listed when added as an
ingredient to foods.  But free glutamate is a natural component of
many foods, such as Parmesan cheese and even tomatoes.

The FDA is using the analysis in order to determine whether the
level of free glutamate should be included on labels when present
in a "significant" amount.  A quantitative value of "significance"
is yet to be defined.  According to the Institute of Food
Technologists ("Monosodium Glutamate: A Statement of the Institute
of Food Technologists" Food Technology [49(10):28, 1995]), the
glutamate content of MSG is 78%, while the glutamate content of
hydrolyzed vegetable protein is about 8%.

The report concluded that MSG is safe since the short-lived adverse
reactions are confined to a small subset of the population.  No
studies have demonstrated long-term effects from the ingestion of
MSG, such as the development of tumors or toxicity to the nervous
system.  Other organizations deeming MSG safe include the World
Health Organization, American Medical Assn., Commission on European
Communities, and Institute of Food Technologists.

Most foods contain less than 0.5 grams of MSG per serving.  The
report found that about 3 grams of MSG are necessary for an adverse
reaction to occur.  Subjects eating large amounts of MSG on an
empty stomach were most likely to complain of ill effects.

MSG is made by fermenting starch, corn sugar, or molasses from
sugar cane or sugar beets.  The ingredient harmonizes with salty
and sour tastes, but does little to enhance sweet foods.  Some
scientists classify MSG's effect as a fifth taste sensation known
as "umami."

According to Chemical Marketing Reporter [248:18, 1995], the annual
U.S. market for MSG is 40,000-50,000 metric tons.  Two companies
produce the ingredient domestically, Archer Daniels Midland Co.
(4666 Faries Pkwy., P.O. Box 1470, Decatur, IL 62525; Tel: 217/424-
5200, Fax: 217/424-5839) and Ajinomoto USA (Eddyville, IA).  Both
operations are fairly new:  Ajinomoto USA's domestic plant has been
in operation since 1993, and Archer Daniels Midland Co.'s site went
online in 1994.  MSG's cost per pound is about 69 cents.

While the domestic demand for MSG is stable, exports are on the
increase.  About 60% of the exports are sent to Canada, Mexico, and
the U.K., but the Netherlands and France are also consumers of
American-made MSG.  In 1994, exports totaled about 193 metric tons,
and in 1995, shipments increased to 5,000 metric tons.  One source
claims that the worldwide demand for MSG is increasing by 10% or
20% annually.  The report prepared for the FDA may help to redress
MSG's tarnished image in the U.S. and enhance annual consumption
levels here.

More Intense
Cinnamon Flavor

Baltimore Spice, Inc. (9740 Reisterstown Rd., Owings Mills, MD
21117; Tel: 800/365-3229, Fax: 410/363-6619) is introducing an
encapsulated cinnamon to help bakers who have yeast leavening
problems when adding ground cinnamon to a yeast dough. Typically,
bakers either reduce cinnamon usage in the dough to allow more
leavening or change to topical cinnamon application rather than
adding to the dough. Both of these techniques, however, can
diminish desired cinnamon flavor.

To provide a stronger flavor impact and instant release of volatile
oils, encapsulated cinnamon may be used instead of regular ground
cinnamon, and at a slightly lower level that will still produce an
acceptable cinnamon flavor. The outcome is greater leavening
because there is a decreased percentage of cinnamon in the dough.

SFE Compared with
SPE for Ham Analysis

The conventional method for analyzing N-nitrosamines in hams was
challenged by the development of a supercritical fluid extraction
(SFE) method.  Scientists at the Eastern Regional Research Center
of the Dept. of Agriculture (Agricultural Research Service,
Philadelphia, PA 19118; Tel: 215/233-6400) compared solid phase
extraction (SPE) to SFE for extracting N-nitrosamines in hams
processed in elastic rubber nettings.

Both the SPE and the SFE methods used gas chromatographic-
chemiluminescence detection.  The SFE's variable restrictor was
equipped with a silica gel adsorption cartridge.  No statistical
difference was found between the results obtained by the two
methods.  Advantages of SFE are the reduction in solvent use and
the speed of the analysis.

John W. Pensabene, Walter Fiddler, Robert J. Maxwell, Alan R.
Lightfield, and James W. Hampson published "Supercritical Fluid
Extraction of N-Nitrosamines in Hams Processed in Elastic Rubber
Nettings" in the Journal of the Association of Official Analytical
Chemistry [78(3):744-748, 1995].

Pesticides Removed
from Fruits, Veggies

Two recent publications describe the removal of pesticides from
vegetables and fruits using supercritical fluid extraction (SFE).
Both studies found SFE an acceptable method for the removal of
pesticides from produce for analysis.

Steven J. Lehotay and Konstantin I. Eller of the Beltsville
Agricultural Research Center of the Dept. of Agriculture
(Environmental Chemistry Lab, Bldg. 7, Rm. 224, Beltsville, MD
20705-2351; Tel: 301/504-6078) developed a method for analyzing the
levels of 46 pesticides in grapes, carrots, potatoes, and broccoli.
The multiresidue method used SFE in conjunction with gas
chromatography/ion trap mass spectrometry in order to extract and
analyze residues.

The SFE was performed at 320 atm and 60C, and the extracts were
trapped on solid phase media.  Silica gel bound to octadecylsilane
was found suitable for this purpose.  The trap was then eluted with
acetonitrile.  Next, the chromatographic analysis was performed.
Greater than 80% recoveries were achieved for 39 of the 46
pesticides.  The recoveries of the other pesticides, with the
exception of methamidophos and omethoate, were more than 50%.

Both incurred and fortified samples were used in a subsequent
analysis to evaluate the method.  The blind experiment showed that
this method resulted in recoveries similar to results from seven
laboratories using solvent-based extractions with traditional gas
chromatograph detectors.

Lehotay tells FIN that the focus of his work is pesticide analysis
of agricultural commodities, and SFE is one of the primary methods
of extraction being developed by the lab.  The study was published
as "Development of a Method of Analysis for 46 Pesticides in Fruits
and Vegetables by Supercritical Fluid Extraction and Gas
Chromatography/Ion Trap Mass Spectrometry" in the Journal of the
Association of Official Analytical Chemistry [78(3):821-830, 1995].

In a similar study, scientists in Spain used a simple SFE method to
remove pesticide residues from fresh pepper, cucumber, and tomato
samples.  Under moderate conditions, commercial SFE equipment
extracted methamidophos at a level greater than 70%, as well as
chlorpyrifos, endosulfan, and procymidone.

The fresh samples were mixed with anhydrous magnesium sulfate.
Methanol was used as a modifier for the carbon dioxide fluid.

Focus on Foods'
Health Benefits

Marketers of dairy, tomato, and perhaps flour products have some
heartening news about the health benefits of their foods. The
findings from three independent studies concluded that aged persons
should eat more dairy foods to get vitamin D to reduce risk of bone
loss, men should eat tomatoes to reduce risk of prostate cancer,
and women of childbearing age should eat foods rich in folic-acid
to reduce risk of birth defects.

A report published in the December 5 issue of The Journal of the
American Medical Association found that many elderly people fail to
get enough vitamin D because they lack opportunities to get outdoor
exposure to sunlight.  Sitting by a sunny window won't do the job
because the glass filters out the ultraviolet light needed to
convert precursor molecules to vitamin D in the skin.

The report was based on a study conducted at the Union Memorial
Hospital's Div. of Geriatrics in Baltimore. The subjects were 244
people age 65 and over, some of whom were confined to nursing homes
or in their own homes, and some who were able to go outdoors. The
study raised the question as to whether recommended dietary
allowance levels should be reevaluated in order to see if higher
levels of vitamin D supplementation are needed.  Mentioned as good
natural sources of vitamin D were milk, dairy products, egg yolk,
oily fish such as sardines, salmon, tuna and liver.

Foods containing tomatoes, which are rich in the antioxidant,
lycopene, are believed to provide higher levels of protection
against prostate cancer, according to Harvard University
researchers led by Dr. Edward Giovannucci of  the Harvard School of
Public Health. Men who ate at least 10 servings per week were found
to have a 45% lower rate of the cancer compared to men who ate 4-7
servings weekly and had only a 20% reduction in the cancer.

Further good news is that the tomatoes could be in any form, such
as sauces, juice, raw and even in pizza. In fact, cooked tomato
products appeared to be more protective than either juice or raw
tomatoes, on the assumption that when tomatoes are heated their
cells burst and release more lycopene.

The nine-year study examined the eating habits of 47,000 men in the
health professions between the ages of 40 and 75, and was published
in the December 7 issue of The Journal of the National Cancer
Institute. The first survey was taken in 1986, and the subjects
were followed and periodically re-examined. At the end of the study
in 1992, there were 812 cases of prostate cancer among the
subjects, and the dietary histories of these cancer subjects were
then compared with the subjects who did not develop the cancer.

Also published in the December 5 issue of JAMA  was a report from
the University College in Dublin, Ireland which stated that
fortifying food with folic acid may be the best way to reduce the
number of babies born with severe birth defects.  Irish researchers
at the college said a four-year study of blood samples from
pregnant women showed that those with the lowest levels of folate,
a salt of folic acid, in red blood cells had the highest risk of
bearing a child with a neural tube defect such as spina bifida.

A 48% reduction in the total neural tube defect rate is
theoretically achievable with an increased population intake of 0.4
milligrams per day of folic acid, according to the report, and this
could better be realized by fortifying foods than with
supplementation. Folic acid, a vitamin necessary for blood marrow
to make red blood cells, is found in a wide variety of foods,
particularly liver and raw vegetables. In the U.S., there is
discussion about fortifying flour with folic acid because it is a
staple in the diet and women wouldn't have to change their dietary
habits in order to intake adequate levels.

Consumers Trust
Farmers the Most

After all the money and trouble that food processors went through
to create new labels, how do consumers rank them as credible
sources of information about foods?  Second only to farmers,
according to the second annual American Food Consumer Survey
recently conducted by Purina Mills, Inc. of St. Louis.  The study
asked more than 3,500 consumers from across the country about their
attitudes, practices and sources of knowledge concerning their food
supply, during August-September, 1995.

The food information sources considered as "most credible" by the
survey's respondents included farmers (26%), food labels (19%),
family and friends (14%), food industry (10%), educators (9%),
government agencies (9%), grocers/supermarkets (6%), news media
(4%) and advertising (3%). Further findings were that 74% believe
that farmers should use high yield farming technology to feed our
growing population; 63% feel that the food they consume is safe,
and the greatest concerns among respondents about our food supply
are in the areas of water contamination, bacterial contamination
and pesticide use.

New Markets Sought
by U.S. Food Makers

The search for new markets via new product development or new lands
to sell to have forged three recent marketing agreements between a
leading baking products company and the market leader of fat-free
and reduced-fat snack foods, a maker of natural foods and three
Japanese companies that will market them, and a world-leading soup
company acquires a controlling interest in a joint venture to
penetrate southeast Asian markets.

Pillsbury, the Minneapolis-based subsidiary of Britain's Grand
Metropolitan PLC will produce, market and sell SnackWell's baking
mix products under license from Nabisco.  The first product will be
SnackWell's Low Fat Fudge Brownie Mix, and shipments will begin
this month. The mix was created by a proprietary balancing of
ingredients in order to achieve the rich chocolate flavor of high-
quality brownies, but with less fat. Each brownie has just 2.5
grams of fat, compared with 7 grams in regular fudge brownie mixes.

The baking mix marks the first time the SnackWell's name appears
for this type of product. Currently, the Snackwell's line includes
fat-free and reduced-fat cookies, crackers, breakfast bars, yogurts
and instant puddings.  In just three years, Nabisco's SnackWell's
has become the largest cookie and cracker brand in the U.S.

Since Japanese consumers are like their American counterparts and
want healthy foods, Kushi Macrobiotics Corp. of Stamford, CT has
formed an agreement with three major Japanese natural food retail
and wholesale companies that will market the Kushi Cuisine line of
premium natural food products:  Meiwa Sangyo Co. Ltd., a subsidiary
of Mitsubishi Corp., Anew-Naturally Yours Co. Ltd., and TKB Mart.
Kushi Cuisine products will be the only nationally available line,
and it will include 33 premium, easy-to-prepare natural foods.

Camden, NJ-based Campbell Soup Co., which is the world's leading
soup company, is acquiring its first manufacturing facility in
Southeast Asia, in Malaysia. Campbell has achieved this move by
acquiring the controlling interest in a joint venture with one of
Malaysia's leading food firms,  privately owned Cheong Chan (Hup
Kee) Sdn. Bhd. of Petaling Jaya. The new company will manufacture
soups, chili sauces, ketchup and foodservice products and ethnic
Chinese sauces.  Campbell will market and distribute these products
throughout the ASEAN (Association of South East Asia Nations)
countries of Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei, Thailand, The
Philippines and Vietnam.

Campbell is hoping to capitalize on the love of soup in Asia, as
well as the strength of Malaysia's economy. A total of 40% of the
world's soup is consumed in Asia, either homemade or commercial.
Soup consumption is strong in Southeast Asia, particularly among
ethnic Chinese, and prepared, packaged soup is popular among people
in the upper income segments. The top selling Campbell soup in Asia
is corn soup designed especially for the local market.

Malaysia has one of the strongest and fastest growing economies in
the Asia Pacific region, and 1995 was the seventh year in which the
growth rate was above 8%. While only 17.5 million people live in
Malaysia, there are  some 300 million people living in southeast
Asia, 83 million of whom live in urban areas.

Companies Expand
and Restructure

To deal with projected domestic growth, one company expands a
facility, and with an eye toward global growth, two companies
reorganize their U.S. or international divisions.

Opta Food Ingredients, Inc. headquartered in Bedford, MA has
completed the expansion of its Louisville, KY facility that will
double its capacity to produce Oat Fibers, its line of functional
texturizing agents that can also increase dietary fiber in foods.
The expansion was in response to increased demand for the
proprietary ingredient from its customers, who include food
processors and foodservice operators. Among the former are five of
the 10 largest U.S. consumer packaged food companies.

Eastman Chemical Co. based in Kingsport, TN has combined two of its
businesses to create a new organization to be known as Performance
Chemicals.  As of January 1, the company's Polymer Modifiers and
Nutrition and Formulation Products businesses will be one
organization that includes four business units, one of which is
Food Ingredients and Specialty Products. Specialty Products is a
consolidation of four business segments--Cosmetics  and Personal
Care, Nutritional Supplements, Textile Chemicals and  Urethane
Intermediates.  (The other three business units comprising
Performance Chemicals are involved with chemicals and
pharmaceuticals.)

International giant, Philip Morris Co. has reorganized Kraft Foods
International, a subsidiary of Kraft Foods, Inc. The international
subsidiary has extensive coffee, confectionery, cheese and other
food operations throughout Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the
Asia/Pacific region. The restructured Kraft Foods International
will include four separate regional units--Kraft Jacobs Suchard
Western Europe; Kraft Jacobs Suchard Northern Europe; Kraft Jacobs
Suchard Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, and
Kraft Foods Asia/Pacific.

Xylose Plant Now
Under Construction

Cultor (Kyllikinportti 2, SF-00240 Helsinki, Finland) plans to
construct a $70 million xylose plant in Austria.  Xylose is used in
the production of xylitol, an ingredient used to sweeten chewing
gum and oral hygiene products. Cultor's subsidiary, Xyrofin, claims
that worldwide demand for xylitol is increasing by 25% annually.
The subsidiary also claims to have 80% of the world market for
xylitol.

The xylose plant will be located next to a birch pulp production
unit, allowing Cultor to use one of the byproducts of pulp
production for the extraction of xylose.  The streamlined logistics
will enhance the efficiency of the process.

Processors Acquire
Ingredient Firms

Some processed products used as basic ingredients in processed
foods have new addresses, as does a supplier of flavors and
seasonings. Some recent sales include companies that make potato
products, fruit products, Italian food products, and pickle and
specialty food products.

Minneapolis-based Michael Foods, Inc. bought the institutional
refrigerated potato products business of Interstate Food Processing
Corp., located in fort Fairfield, MR  Interstate is the second
largest producer in the U.S. of foodservice refrigerated potato
products after Michael Foods' Northern Star Co. subsidiary.

Monitor Sugar Co. of Bay City, MI has purchased Graceland Fruit
Cooperative of Frankfort, MI, the country's premier supplier of
preservative-free dried fruit products to the food processing,
foodservice and grocery markets. Food processors use the fruits in
cereals, baked goods, dairy products, trail mix, candy and other
food products.

Garma Gourmet Group of Milan, Italy has acquired the Italian Food
Products division of The Quaker Oats Co. The divested businesses
include edible oils marketed under the Cuore and Topazio brand
names, and Polenta Valsugana, a pre-cooked corn flour meal. The
Italian Food Products division is located in Silea, Italy. This
continues the company's recent policy of shedding divisions outside
its core beverage and grain-based foods businesses.

Dean Foods Co. of Franklin Park, IL has acquired Paramount Foods,
LLC, a pickle and specialty products processor located in
Louisville, KY.  Paramount sells pickles and other specialty food
items under the Paramount label, and private labels to retail and
foodservice outlets throughout the Mid-South.  Dean Foods started
its pickle business over 30 years with the acquisition of the
original Green Bay Food Co.  Subsequently, through the acquisition
of successful regional pickle companies, Dean has grown to become
one of the two largest pickle businesses in the U.S.  In addition,
on a national basis, Dean is a leading producer of dairy products,
ranks third in market share in processed vegetables, and second in
pickles and specialty  products.

Technology Flavors & Fragrances, Inc. located in Amityville, NY
bought Seafla, Inc. of Milford, OH. Seafla is a maker of premium
savory flavors, seasonings and cheese powders used in making
convenience foods, snack foods, condiments, bakery products,
confectioneries, deli-foods, and meat, poultry and seafood
products. Technology develops and makes flavors for use in natural
flavored beverages, confectioneries, and health foods.

Meats and Baked
Goods Acquired

ConAgra Inc.'s Bronx, NY-based National Foods has acquired Mogen
David's meats sold under the brand names of Mogen David, American
Kosher, Isaac Gellis, Judea and Zion. Mogen David distributes
kosher products, including smoked and cured meats and sausage
products throughout the tri-state New York metropolitan region and
in Florida.  The purchase reflects ConAgra's continuing interest in
the kosher meat market, which began in 1992 with its acquisition of
National Foods, manufacturer of Hebrew National, a leading
processor of kosher meats in the U.S. National  Foods, reports to
ConAgra's Armour Swift-Eckrich division.

Chiquita Brands International, Inc. of Cincinnati sold its Meat
Div. to Smithfield Foods, Inc. This action now completes Chiquita's
exit from the meat business, which is outside its core business of
processing food products, and where it is an international leader.
Silverado Foods, Inc. of Tulsa, OK purchased MarveLoaf Corp. of
Holbrook, NY, maker of a low fat yogurt cake, and a line of muffins
and crumb cakes.  The purchase complements Silverado's specialty
baked goods products, part of the company's product line which also
includes gourmet and snack foods.

Sugar Prices Drop,
Maybe Up for Milk

With the announcement by a leading candy maker that prices for a
candy bar will go up five cents, the Washington DC-based American
Sugar Farmers were quick to point out that the price hike had
nothing to do with the price of sugar.  That's because sugar prices
have decreased during the past five years, and cane and beet
farmers have not had a price increase in 10 years.

Supporting this contention are figures from the Dept. of
Agriculture and the Bureau of Labor Statistics which report that
the wholesale price that food manufacturers pay for their sugar has
fallen 16% since 1990.  However, during this same period, the
prices for sugar-containing products, such as candy, bakery goods,
cereal and soft drinks, have increased from 10-22%. So like the man
said, it can't be because of sugar.

Milk prices are another matter because their increase may be traced
to the well-meaning but misguided program currently under
consideration by Congress. According to the International Dairy
Foods Association of Washington, DC, the new dairy plan would lock
in milk prices at January 1996 levels,  the highest levels in the
past five years, and would cost consumers an estimated $1 billion
more annually.

The plan was worked out by the National Milk Producers Federation,
an organization that represents the major dairy farmer
cooperatives. The plan would eliminate some of the surplus products
the government would purchase, locking in a minimum price level for
fluid milk, and adding several new ways that milk producers would
share the money paid for their milk.  Budget savings would be
accrued by changing the government's policy of buying surplus dairy
products. Currently, the dairy price support program buys any
butter, milk powder or cheese that isn't purchased.  Under the new
plan, this would involve only cheese.

The outcome could be that butter and powder would be dumped on
world markets at low prices, which would then be subsidized by a
new system assessing all dairy farmers to cover the difference
between lower prices and former government support levels. This
scenario could cause a shortage of dairy ingredients for U.S. food
manufacturers, forcing up prices of finished products at the
consumer level.

Shifts Seen in
Vitamin E

The market for tocopherol is undergoing major changes a natural
tocopherol is becoming increasingly available for food applications
and as key players in the business are forming strong alliances.

The global tocopherol market is currently almost $1 billion. Most
of this tocopherol, which is produced by synthesis, is used in
agricultural feed. About $100 million in sales are generated by the
food industry.  The market for synthetic tocopherol is shared by
four companies: Hoffmann-LaRoche, with a market share of 45%; BASF,
with a market share of 28%, Rhone Poulenc, with a market share of
16%; and Eisei, at 11%.

A specialty in the food market is natural tocopherol. This is
obtained by an extraction and purification process from soya scams,
the residues which remain after soya oil is processed and refined.
The current worldwide market for natural tocopherol is about $50
million and is shared by Henkel, Eastman Chemical, and Eisei.
Although these companies produce their natural tocopherol by their
own technology, they all depend on the provision of the raw
material by other companies.  The global soya oil industry is
controlled by only two companies: Archer Daniels Midland (ADM),
which has a 40% share, and Cargill, with 35%.

Hoffmann-LaRoche signed an agreement with Cargill in early 1995 to
jointly construct a 1000 ton natural tocopherol plant.  While
Cargill is responsible for supplying raw material, Hoffmann-LaRoche
is responsible for marketing.

The plant is scheduled to come onstream in late 1996. At full
capacity, it will consume about 50% of the worldwide production of
soya scams.  Since the global production of soya oil has reached a
plateau, there is not much raw material left for competitors.

Eastman obtains its soya scams from ADM, but a major procurement
problem will  arise for Henkel--and especially Eisei.  Roche could
eventually obtain a market share of 70%.

Tocopherol is also contained in significant amounts in palm oil and
palm leaves. However the extraction of  pure tocopherol is much
more difficult.  Henkel and Eisei both have a strong position in
the palm oil market, especially in Malaysia and Indonesia.  These
companies may well turn their efforts to developing  new processing
technology to wrest tocopherol from palm sources.  The palm oil
industry is booming and the raw materials available to making
tocopherol are therefore increasing.

Demand for Garlic
Is Seen Tripling

Garlic production in the U.S. has tripled in the past 20 years,
according to a cover story appearing in Smithsonian.  In 1975, the
Dept. of Agriculture recorded 140 million pounds of garlic
produced, and in 1994, the figure had soared to 493 million pounds.
The current annual growth rate is about 10%.

The U.S. also imports garlic from Argentina, Chile, China, Mexico,
Spain, and Taiwan.  About 100 million pounds of the pungent,
bulbous herb are imported each year.  The per capita consumption
was estimated to be 0.6 pounds in 1975 and 1.6 pounds in 1994.  In
Europe, per capita garlic consumption is twice as great.

As a food ingredient, garlic is available as a puree, dry flakes,
and powder.  The product is used in a variety of foods, including
frozen dinners, powdered mixes, and bottled sauces.  California is
responsible for 90% of the commercial garlic produced in the U.S.

FDA Proposes
Changes in NLEA

If you market a food that can deliver health benefits to consumers,
you want to let them know about it.  That's the attitude of members
of the Washington, DC-based National Food Processors Assn. (NFPA)
who have been petitioning the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to
make changes in the NLEA since October 1994.  Now it looks like
their efforts will be rewarded because the FDA is proposing to
amend existing regulations governing health claims and nutrient
content claims.

The October 25 petition was followed by a preliminary answer from
the FDA on May 11, 1995 which stated there would be some favorable
responses to some requests. The newly proposed rule, published in
the Federal Register on December 21, 1995, calls for:

 Flexibility in Health Claims Language - provides greater
flexibility in health claims language for some of the longer health
claims currently in effect. One proposed amendment focuses on the
calcium-osteoporosis health claims removing the requirement for
noting that specific populations (i.e., White and Asian women) are
at particular risk for osteoporosis. FDA is proposing to permit,
under certain conditions, abbreviated health claims that are
truthful and non-misleading and that include a referral statement
directing consumers to the complete claim elsewhere on the label.
FDA has acknowledged the benefits of permitting more consumer-
friendly messages and communications as supporting the intent of
the health claims concept.

 Synonyms and Implied Nutrient Content Claims - allows the use of
synonymous nutrient content claims on food labels when consistent
with, and adjacent to the defined nutrient content claim term.
FDA's proposal allows the use of synonymous nutrient content claims
on food labels.  In the FDA's view, undefined synonyms of nutrient
content claim terms must be presented on the label immediately
adjacent to a defined term.  The defined term would be required to
be used with the most prominent undefined term, following the rules
outlining prominence of claims.

 Modifications to the "Jelly Bean" Rule in Health Claims -
modifies the requirement prohibiting a health claim from being made
on a food which does not contain at least 10% Daily Value per
serving of at least one of a number of nutrients.  The FDAs
proposed rule modifies the minimum nutrient contribution
requirement, or "jelly bean" rule, for health claims.  This
requirement prohibits a health claim from being made on a food
which does not contain at least 10% Daily Value per serving of
vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, iron, protein, or fiber.
Specifically, FDA has proposed to exempt raw and processed fruits
and vegetables, and enriched cereal grain products and enriched
bread with standards of identity, from the "jelly bean" rule.  The
FDA also will consider whether other types of foods, such as
formulated products, should also be exempt from the "jelly bean"
rule.

 Health Claims Disqualifying Nutrient Levels - discusses case-by-
case evaluation of changing disqualifying levels for total fat,
saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium, which would prohibit the use
of any health claim, to levels which would trigger a disclosure-
type referral statement. FDA denied a request in the NFPA petition
that FDA change disqualifying nutrient levels for total fat,
saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium, which would prohibit the use
of any health claim to levels which would trigger a disclosure-type
referral statement.

NFPA had requested that health claims be prohibited only when the
nutrient is adversely associated with the disease referenced in the
health claim. While FDA denied this broad approach, the Agency
indicated it will evaluate this case-by-case.  FDA included in the
preamble to the claims proposed rule substantial guidance to
petitioners, and discusses factors to be considered in any request
that disqualifying nutrient levels be changed to levels requiring
label disclosure.

Another denial by the FDA was NFPA's request that the agency allow
truthful, non-misleading health claims established as presumptively
valid based on the findings of scientifically authoritative third
parties. The FDA stated it does not have authority under existing
law to approve such a policy change.

FDA Requires
HACCP for Seafood

Consumer concern about the safety of eating seafood is about to be
mitigated. The FDA has set safety regulations for the seafood
industry that involve using preventive controls based on principles
of the system, Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP).
Seafood processors must identify potential problems that could make
seafood unsafe, then establish and monitor targeted control points
to minimize the hazards, and then keep a record of the results.

FDA surveillance and inspection programs will still be in place but
HACCP recordkeeping will enable regulators to monitor product
safety more effectively on a more continuous basis rather than rely
on the previous system which involved spot checks.  Seafood
processors are responsible for both domestic and imported seafood
materials. The program will be fully implemented over the next two
years but inspections begin in 1996.

The new ruling was immediately applauded by the commercial seafood
industry which sees the HACCP program as one that will benefit
federal and state inspectors, consumers and seafood processors.
Inspectors will now have a historical view of the facility because
HACCP records will date back to the last inspection visit.
Consumers will be assured of seafood safety and quality, and
processors will have a cost-effective system that will help to
increase sales of processed seafood products.

Meat Processors Want
Safety Rules, Too

Now that consumers will be assured of the safety of seafood
products, processors of some types of meat products feel that they
are at a disadvantage because they can't provide the same
assurances. Specifically, the day after the FDA announced its new
requirements for seafood processors (see above story) the National
Pork Producers Council and the National Cattlemen's Assn. announced
that beef and pork industry leaders formed a working group to
prepare a plan of action to achieve equity between red meat and
poultry inspection and food safety issues.

The aim is to improve the food safety process, create a more level
playing field for producers, and provide better information for
consumers.  The group is to consider regulatory, legislative, and
judicial issues to ensure that new safety regulations set the same
requirements for all meat and poultry products, and "to eliminate
economic inequities that put beef and pork at an economic
disadvantage in the meat case."

MEAT AND POULTRY PROPOSAL:  

MEAT AND POULTRY PROPOSAL:  The Food Safety and Inspection 
Service published a Dec. 29 proposed rule to amend its meat 
and poultry inspection regulations to "harmonize and 
improve" the procedures used by FSIS and FDA for reviewing 
and approving the use of substances in meat and poultry 
products.  Under the proposal, FSIS would no longer issue 
its own regulations listing the substances it finds 
suitable, instead deferring to FDA for future regulations on 
suitable substances for meat and poultry products.  FDA 
published a similar proposal in the same issue of the 
Federal Register.  (EDITOR'S NOTE:  This proposal will be 
covered in greater detail in next week's issue of FOOD 
LABELING & NUTRITION NEWS.)

FSIS REGULATORY STREAMLINING 

FSIS REGULATORY STREAMLINING was pledged again by the agency 
in a Dec. 29 Federal Register notice accompanying proposals 
on prior label review, modifying standards and elimination 
of prior approval for additions to meat and poultry products 
(See separate stories).  The agency asked for comment by 
Feb. 27.

FDA STREAMLINING:  

FDA STREAMLINING:  The Grocery Manufacturers of America said 
it is pleased that FDA has taken a partial step toward 
streamlining its "bulky" nutrition labeling regulations, but 
added that it remains to be seen whether the agency's 
proposal on nutrient content and health claims will actually 
allow food companies to make changes in label claims, a GMA 
spokesman told FOOD LABELING & NUTRITION NEWS (See FLN Dec. 
21, Page 11).  CSPI's Bruce Silverglade argued, however, 
that FDA's proposed changes will allow companies to "clutter 
up" the label with information that will make it more 
difficult for consumers to identify "low" and "reduced fat" 
foods.  "FDA should be clearing up these problems instead of 
making it easier for food companies to make health and 
nutrition claims," Silverglade said.

ACTION FOR NUTRITION 

ACTION FOR NUTRITION draft U.S. plan was made available 
through  Dec. 28 Federal Register notice by the three 
sponsoring agencies:  USDA, Department of HHS and the Agency 
for International Development.  The nine aspects of the 
international plan include:  (1) incorporating nutritional 
objectives into development policies; (2) improving 
household food security; (3) protecting consumers through 
improved food quality and safety; (4) preventing and 
managing infectious diseases; (5) promoting breastfeeding; 
(6) caring for the socio-economically deprived and 
nutritionally vulnerable; (7) preventing and controlling 
specific micronutrient deficiencies; (8) promoting 
appropriate diets and healthy lifestyles, and (9) assessing, 
analyzing and monitoring nutritional situations.

BATF ACTIVITY:  

BATF ACTIVITY:  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms 
issued a Dec. 29 final rule allowing up to 300 milligrams 
per liter (300 ppm) of citric acid to be added to vodka 
without changing the product's designation as "vodka."  
"This level was intended to ensure that distiller may 
continue to use citric acid as a smoothing agent to correct 
objectionable tastes which might result from such things as 
the water used in reducing the proof, the charcoal used in 
distillation or the glass in which packaged," BATF said, 
noting that by definition, vodka may not have any 
distinctive taste, color, aroma or character.  The rule went 
into effect immediately.

PHYTOCHEMICAL INVESTIGATOR URGES DENIAL OF OLESTRA 
PETITION

A researcher investigating the anti-cancer potential of 
phytochemicals has warned FDA not to approve the pending 
food additive petition for olestra, predicting that use of 
the product may have a negative health impact.  However, a 
host of letters received by the agency last week stressed 
that research has confirmed the safety of the fat substitute 
(See FLN Dec. 21, Page 3, and Dec. 28, Page 3).

Jed Fahey, faculty research associate with the Brassica 
Chemoprotection Laboratory at the Johns Hopkins School of 
Medicine, said he was "distressed" by the data indicating 
that olestra may reduce absorption of many fat-soluble 
vitamins.  "There are a great number of other, fat-soluble 
phytochemicals, some of which we are investigating in my 
laboratory for their anti-cancer potential," Fahey said, 
adding, "Many of them have yet to even be isolated in pure 
form and are therefore unavailable for testing."

"The inclusion of olestra in commonly consumed American 
foods has a high probability of effecting the wholesale 
reduction of a multiplicity of beneficial compounds from the 
diet of a great many Americans," the letter to FDA 
Commissioner Dr. David Kessler said, adding, "Based on 
overwhelming epidemiological evidence, there is a high 
probability that the use of this product would have a 
negative health impact."

Comments from the American Diabetes Association and the 
American Heart Association took no specific stand on whether 
FDA should approve olestra.  ADA said it supports the 
development and introduction into the marketplace of food 
products that help people lose or maintain weight, but added 
that it "looks to and respects the FDA review process for 
assurance of product safety."  AHA encouraged FDA to 
continue the review of all fat replacers.  The group noted 
that many products on the market labeled as "reduced fat" 
have significant amounts of mono- and diglycerides, which 
are a source of calories and are metabolized as fat.

The comments of a variety of researchers supporting approval 
of the fat substitute -- some of which were sent in by 
Procter & Gamble, the petition's sponsor --  were also 
included in the FDA administrative file on olestra.  Many of 
these letters included positive comments about the conduct 
of the four-day Food Advisory Committee meeting held by FDA 
in November to consider the data on olestra (See FLN Nov. 
23, Page 10).  The comment period on the petition ended Dec. 
21.


The American Dietetic Association said one of its 
representatives attended the advisory committee and working 
group meetings on olestra, and added:  "We believe that the 
process allowed for a full airing of ADA's views on this 
matter.  We fully support the FAC review process including 
its interpretation of the data and consideration of public 
comment."

A co-discoverer of olestra, Dr. Fred Mattson, professor of 
medicine emeritus at the University of California in San 
Diego, noted that as early work on the compound progressed, 
"I came to the conclusion that olestra posed no hazard as a 
food ingredient."

"Subsequent studies have served to strengthen this opinion," 
Mattson noted.  He noted that olestra "is now supported by a 
much wider range of studies and now many of these are on 
human subjects.  Moreover, the level of use is inherently 
limited by the nature of the food products in which it will 
be used."

Nutritionist Johanna Dwyer of Tufts University said her 
interest in fat substitutes such as olestra led her to 
independently review some of the studies in the peer-reviewed 
literature.  Later, she was asked by P&G to review and edit 
two papers for publication on consumption models and use of 
the pig and other data for assessing human effects of feeding 
olestra.  Citing her specific interest in gastrointestinal 
effects, Dwyer said she requested and received additional 
information on GI effects, and devoted particular attention 
to what might be expected at very high levels of intakes.

At Dwyer's request, P&G sent her blinded samples of olestra-
containing potato chips and regular potato chips at amounts 
that would constitute the 95th percentile of intake.  Dwyer 
said she ate these potato chips in a single bolus amount for 
a meal on two separate days and subsequently recorded her 
own views of signs and symptoms of GI distress.  "I felt 
more GI distress when eating the regular potato chips, and 
did not record any differences in stool consistency in this 
brief experiment," Dwyer wrote.  She noted that very high 
chronic use might produce changes in the consistency of the 
stool, but it is "inappropriate to describe these changes as 
diarrhea."

Dwyer said she concluded that the product "is safe and may 
provide a benefit to some consumers who wish to eat low fat, 
low saturated fat salty snacks."  She added that the FDA 
evaluation process and the advisory committee deliberations 
"were reasonable, thorough and helpful."

Dr. Harry Greene, clinical professor of pediatrics at 
Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said he attended the 
advisory committee meeting in November and was "extremely 
impressed with the presentations by the FDA scientists and 
the presentations by the expert consultants brought in by 
FDA in providing an unbiased and scientific approach to the 
relevant studies which have been performed with olestra."

CSPI took data out of context, researcher charges

Greene criticized presentations by the Center for Science in 
the Public Interest, saying much of the data "was taken out 
of context" or "completely misinterpreted due to a lack of 
scientifically acceptable statistical evaluation, and in 
many instances was anecdotal."  In contrast, he said, "the 
data presented by Procter & Gamble scientists represented 
clear examples of well controlled, scientifically credible 
studies."

Greene said the chairman of the advisory committee made sure 
that CSPI had an equal opportunity to present its 
objections.

Also charging that CSPI took data out of context, Dr. 
Michael Davidson, medical director of the Chicago Center for 
Clinical Research at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical 
Center, noted that the clinical studies by P&G "were 
purposely designed to assess the extreme intakes of olestra 
in subjects of various body sizes and dietary habits."  
Davidson pointed out that olestra "was used to replace 
almost 50% of the daily fat intake for those in the 32-gram 
dose group," which he said "included petite young women who 
were unaccustomed to large intake of non-digestible food."

"The vast majority of subjects with gastrointestinal events 
were women who would rarely consume 32 grams of olestra on a 
single day, yet were fed 32 grams daily for eight weeks," 
Davidson added.  He noted that approval of olestra "has 
significant health implications for the entire U.S. 
population," since high fat consumption is a leading cause 
of heart disease, diabetes, cancer and obesity.

Researcher reports positive response to olestra in nutrition 
education study

Dr. John Foreyt of the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston 
said he conducted a study on the use of olestra in a 
nutrition education program.  Female adults were randomly 
assigned to either an olestra or non-olestra group, and 
various food products containing olestra, including 
shortening, potato chips, oven-ready french fries and a 
mayonnaise-type salad, were made available as part of an 
overall nutrition education program, Foreyt said.  "Response 
to the product was positive," he commented, noting that 
subjects in both groups reduced their dietary fat 
consumption to approximately 30% of total calories.

"Responses to our questionnaire suggested that subjects with 
access to the olestra products experienced less deprivation 
while reducing dietary fat intake than the subjects without 
access to the olestra products," Foreyt said, adding that 
the study is currently in press.

"Based on our study, and my reading of the olestra research, 
I believe that olestra can help consumers lower overall fat 
intake because it gives them a choice, without sacrificing 
taste," he said.

Dr. Gail Harrison of the University of California School of 
Public Health in Los Angeles complimented the special 
consultants utilized by FDA as in-depth review experts on 
olestra, calling them "absolutely the best in the field."  
Harrison added, "Their reports can be relied upon in terms 
of scientific validity and perspective."

Recommending approval of the compound, Harrison said she is 
"quite thoroughly acquainted with the data base supporting 
the safety of olestra as it is proposed for use in savory 
snacks in the U.S. food supply, and am convinced on the 
basis of reasonable scientific judgment it is safe by the 
standard that FDA must apply."

Other letters recommending approval came from Dr. Elijah 
Saunders of the University of Maryland's School of Medicine, 
Division of Hypertension, and Dr. George Bray, executive 
director of the Pennington Biomedical Research Center at the 
Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.

A letter from Penny Kris-Etherton, professor of nutrition at 
Penn State University, reiterated conclusions she had 
presented for P&G at the advisory committee meeting -- that 
inclusion of olestra snacks would reduce dietary carotenoids 
over a period of seven days by approximately 10%.  The 
calculations assumed that all savory snacks included in  
dietary records randomly selected from study subjects in 
target groups of interest were olestra-containing snacks, 
she said.

"Obviously, in a real world setting, not all savory snacks 
consumed will contain olestra.  Nonetheless, I believe that 
our estimates are reasonable as a means to gain a 
perspective about the average impact of olestra-containing 
snacks in different free-living population groups," Kris-
Etherton added.  ((6FLN 1401, 26 pages, $11)

RESEARCHERS QUESTION LINK BETWEEN TRANS FAT, HEART DISEASE

The alleged link between trans fatty acid intake and 
coronary heart disease risk is questionable, according to a 
critical review of research studies on Trans Fatty Acids and 
CHD Risk conducted by P.M. Kris-Etherton, Ph.D., and R.J. 
Nicolosi, Ph.D., for the International Life Sciences 
Institute.

The report found that the effect of partially hydrogenated 
vegetable oils is relative to the fats or oils they are 
replacing.  Partially hydrogenated vegetable oils actually 
reduce blood total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol 
concentrations when substituted for animal fats (e.g., 
butter and lard) and vegetable fats rich in saturates 
(e.g., palm, palm kernel and coconut oil), the researchers 
said.  Hydrogenated vegetable oils, however, modestly raise 
blood cholesterol levels when substituted for the 
unhydrogenated native oil.  Therefore, the report said, the 
overall effect of hydrogenated fats on blood cholesterol 
concentrations in the population depends on the net change 
in the ingestion of saturated, trans, cis-monounsaturated, 
and cis-polyunsaturated fatty acids.

These findings run contrary to the position of the Center 
for Science in the Public Interest, which filed a petition 
with FDA two years ago to require that trans fat be included 
with saturated fat on food labels, and to limit the trans 
fatty acid content of foods making fatty acid, cholesterol 
or vegetable oil claims (See FLN Feb. 24, 1994, Page 14).

CSPI's position is based on evidence supported by studies 
such as one conducted by Judd et al., published by the 
American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, which suggests that 
trans fat, at levels consumed by the average American, was 
found to raise LDL-cholesterol about the same as does 
saturated fat.  Another study supporting CSPI's stance on 
the issue is the recently presented Sundram et al. abstract, 
which found trans fat to be even more hypercholesterolemic 
than saturated fat (See FLN June 29, Page 5).

Kris-Etherton and Nicolosi's review, however, found that 
epidemiological data are limited in that they may suggest 
relationships but cannot prove cause and effect.  
Epidemiologic investigations conducted in the 1970s and 
1980s found, for the most part, no significant associations 
between trans fatty acid intake and CHD risk, they said.  
Some investigation conducted in the 1990s found significant 
associations between trans fatty acid intake and CHD risk.  
But most of the study results, over the years, have 
illustrated inherent limitations of epidemiological 
research, according to the report.

Investigations conducted in the '70s and '80s, which showed 
no significant association between trans fatty acid and CHD 
risk, examined concentrations of specific trans fatty acids 
in various body tissues or estimated dietary intake of trans 
fatty acids in comparison to various measures of CHD.  Some 
of the studies indicated that the trans fatty acid t-16:1 
was associated with an increased risk of CHD -- the 
predominant source of this fatty acid is animal fat.  This 
suggests that any association between trans fatty acid 
intake and CHD risk may be due more to trans fatty acids 
from animal sources than from partially hydrogenated 
vegetable oils, the report stated.

Three studies published in the 1990s suggested a significant 
relationship between levels of trans fatty acid intake and 
CHD risk or risk factors, the report said.  One of the 
studies found that individuals with the highest and lowest 
intakes of trans fatty acids also had correspondingly lower 
and higher risks of suffering a heart attack.  The lowest 
risks occurred among individuals eating intermediate levels 
of trans fatty acids.  This finding suggests that other 
factors may be involved in the association, the report 
indicated, adding that lack of a dose-response relationship 
between trans fatty acid intake and risk of heart attack 
illustrates one of the limitations of epidemiological 
research.

Current epidemiological data also appear limited in their 
ability to distinguish between the possibility that trans 
fatty acids cause CHD risk or that CHD risk causes increased 
trans fatty acid intake, the report said.  For example, 
individuals who perceive themselves to be at risk of CHD may 
increase their intake of products made with partially 
hydrogenated vegetable oils such as margarine, and decrease 
their intake of products with higher levels of saturated 
fat, which could induce a biased association between trans 
fatty acids and CHD or CHD risk factors.  A 1992 study that 
reported a significant relationship between trans fatty acid 
intake and CHD risk factors attempted to control for this 
possibility.  The result showed that the relationship 
between trans fatty acids and lipids was indeed stronger for 
subjects who had been told that their blood cholesterol 
levels were high.  This study, the report said, supports the 
theory that those who perceive themselves to be at greater 
risk of CHD may increase their intake of trans fatty acids.

Atherosclerotic properties of trans fatty acids in animals 
examined

To define the impact of fatty acids on CHD risk, scientists 
have compared the atherosclerotic properties of saturated, 
unsaturated, and trans fatty acids in animals, the report 
said.  Numerous studies support the atherogenicity of 
saturated fats, and other studies indicate that the 
saturated fatty acids lauric, myristic, and palmitic acids 
appear to have similar arterogenic effects.  A similar 
association with trans fats, however, is not apparent, the 
report said, adding that data suggest that trans fatty acids 
do not increase risk of arteriosclerosis.  Studies conducted 
over the past 30 years on rabbits, monkeys and pigs have 
demonstrated little if any difference between the effects of 
nonhydrogenated and hydrogenated vegetable oils containing 
high concentrations of trans fatty acids on the incidence or 
severity of atherosclerosis, the report said.

Clinical studies conducted over the past 40 years indicate 
that the effects of hydrogenated fats on blood cholesterol 
levels were intermediate between the unhydrogenated native 
oil and more saturated fats, the report said.  To verify 
these findings, metabolic studies of longer duration with a 
more appropriate number of subjects were conducted.  Ten of 
11 studies confirmed that feeding hydrogenated fat produced 
higher total cholesterol concentrations than did 
unhydrogenated native oils. 

All of these studies also confirmed that the increase was 
less than that observed when butter, palm oil, or coconut oil 
was substituted for the native oil, the report said.  In 
addition, several outpatient feeding studies have confirmed 
the finding that consumption of hydrogenated fats resulted in 
lower blood cholesterol concentrations than typical intakes 
of butter or mixed animal and vegetable fats, according to 
the researchers.

Inconsistent effects of trans fatty acids on HDL cholesterol 
levels have been found in other studies.  Three studies 
reported that the consumption of trans fatty acids was 
associated with significant reduction in HDL cholesterol.  
However, three other studies in which trans fatty acids were 
fed at levels consistent with current intakes in the U.S. 
reported no such reduction in HDL cholesterol, the report 
said.

The report indicated that because substituting hydrogenated 
fats for more saturated fats will lower LDL, and lowering 
LDL has been shown to decrease CHD risk, the overall effect 
of hydrogenated fats substituted for saturated fats in the 
food supply may still be beneficial, despite possible small 
reductions in HDL cholesterol concentrations.  This 
conclusion is supported by a large body of evidence that 
shows that populations with habitual low-fat diets have 
lower levels of both LDL and HDL cholesterol and a low 
incidence of heart disease, according to the report.

WARNING LETTER ISSUED TO CHICKPEA MANUFACTURER FOR 
UNDECLARED ADDITIVES 

An FDA warning letter was issued to a chickpea product 
manufacturer for the presence of undeclared FD&C Red #3 and 
FD&C Red #40, and for failing to declare net contents in 
metric as well as in inch-pound units.

Chicago District Director Raymond Mlecko warned Eden 
International Inc. about undeclared FD&C Red #3 in "Eden's Red 
Chickpeas," and FD&C Red #40 in "Eden's Gourmet Mix," colors 
which are required to be declared by name in the statement of 
ingredients, he said.

In addition, Mlecko advised Eden that the net contents 
should be declared in metric units and inch-pound units.  
Because FDA has not published final regulations as to how 
the declaration is to be made, Eden may add the metric 
statements now, using guidance in the proposed regulations 
published in the Federal Register of December 21, 1993, 
Mlecko said.

In the August 30 warning letter, Mlecko also told Eden that 
the violations mentioned are not necessarily an all-
inclusive list of deficiencies on its labels.  Eden was 
advised to review all of its food labels to determine 
whether they are in compliance with all applicable statutes 
enforced by FDA.  ((6FLN 1402, 2 pages, $5)

DIETARY GUIDELINES' EMPHASIS ON CAROTENOIDS CITED IN CSPI 
OLESTRA LETTER

The consumer group Center for Science in the Public 
Interest, continuing its quest to keep olestra out of the 
food supply, has reminded FDA that the newly revised Dietary 
Guidelines for Americans encourage consumers to eat foods 
containing carotenoids.  CSPI contends that the fat replacer 
inhibits the body's ability to absorb fat-soluble vitamins 
(See Page 3 and FLN Dec. 14, Page 3).

In a Jan. 2 letter, intended as an addendum to earlier CSPI 
comments on Procter & Gamble's petition for olestra, CSPI 
Executive Director Dr. Michael Jacobson referred to the 
agency actions as "ironic."  "The National Cancer Institute 
is urging Americans to consume more carotenoid-rich fruits 
and vegetables, in part because of the probable benefits of 
carotenoids themselves," Jacobson said, adding that the 
guidelines stress the importance of carotenoids as follows:

"Most fruits and vegetables are naturally low in fat and 
provide many essential nutrients and other food components 
important for health.  These foods are excellent sources of 
vitamin C, vitamin B6, carotenoids, including those which 
form vitamin A (see Box 7), and folate (Box 8).  The 
antioxidant nutrients found in plant foods (e.g., vitamin C, 
carotenoids, vitamin E and certain minerals) are presently 
of great interest to scientists and the public because of 
their potentially beneficial role in reducing the risk for 
cancer and certain other chronic diseases.  Scientists are 
also trying to determine if other substances in plant foods 
protect against cancer."

Also included in the new guidelines is a special box (Box 7) 
that lists "Some Good Sources of Carotenoids," Jacobson 
said.  Considering the level of recognition carotenoids have 
received in the guidelines, it would be "extra ironic," 
Jacobson said, "if the FDA approves carotenoid-depleting 
olestra just weeks after the newly revised federal nutrition 
policy."

Addressing the issue of whether carotenoids serve any 
biological purpose in humans other than beta-carotene's role 
as a provitamin A, CSPI also submitted an abstract of an 
intervention trial which CSPI said provides further evidence 
that beta-carotene has anti-cancer potential and "offers 
further basis for denying the food-additive petition for 
olestra," CSPI said. 

The study was conducted by Harinder Garewal, M.D., Ph. D., 
of the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Tucson, 
Ariz., and his colleagues at three cancer-research centers, 
CSPI said.  "The key portion of the study involved giving 50 
patients a daily dose of 60 mg of beta-carotene for six 
months.  Twenty-six (52%) of the patients responded to beta-
carotene, with their oral leukoplakia diminishing.  The 
result is similar to that found in an earlier study by 
Garewal that used half as much beta-carotene," according to 
CSPI.

The abstract is an addendum to earlier CSPI comments on 
Procter & Gamble's petition for olestra that included 
intervention trials demonstrating that beta-carotene causes 
regression of oral leukoplakia, CSPI said.  ((6FLN 1403, 2

FDA REJECTS OPTIMAL HEALTH STANDARD FOR DETERMINING RDIs

The Food and Drug Administration has rejected the concept of 
"optimal health" -- a standard requested by dietary 
supplement groups -- as the standard for determining 
Reference Daily Intake values, opting to continue basing 
values on "nutrient adequacy" (See separate stories).

In its Dec. 28 final rule establishing Reference Daily 
Intakes for vitamin K, selenium, manganese, chromium, 
molybdenum and chloride, FDA wrote that it was "not 
persuaded" that a change in the basis for determining RDIs 
is warranted, but noted that since the National Academy of 
Sciences is in the process of evaluating the basis by which 
it determines the Recommended Daily Allowances -- on which 
RDIs are based -- FDA will revisit the issue once NAS reports 
its findings.

"The agency believes that any action to change the basis for 
the RDIs should await completion of the NAS process to 
ensure that such an action reflects scientific consensus and 
to avoid the possible need for consecutive relabeling of 
foods that might occur if FDA were to proceed to revise the 
RDIs before NAS published new values," FDA said. 

The rule also modifies the units of measure used to declare 
the amount of biotin, folate, calcium and phosphorus in food.  
FDA decided not to establish an RDI for fluoride because it 
found no scientific consensus determining that fluoride is an 
essential nutrient.

Vitamin K to be considered in evaluating nutritional 
inferiority of substitute foods

FDA will consider vitamin K when it determines if substitute 
foods are nutritionally inferior to the foods for which they 
substitute, the agency said.  Although it received several 
comments expressing concern that vitamin K should not be 
included in such determinations because of difficulties in 
determining levels of vitamin K in foods,  FDA said it was 
"not persuaded by the comments that there is a lack of 
analytical methods for vitamin K, or that technological 
barriers to analyzing foods for vitamin K, or to adding 
vitamin K to foods, are insurmountable."

The agency noted that many foods that are reformulated as 
substitute foods do not contain much vitamin K in the first 
place, such as foods made primarily of sugar and water, as 
well as many oils, drinks, fruits and fish.  Important 
sources of vitamin K, such as green leafy vegetables, 
legumes and soybean oil, are not generally reformulated, FDA 
noted.

"The primary categories of substitute foods that may need to 
be reformulated or relabeled appear to be those that 
substitute for foods containing eggs, milk, grains, or those 
oils that contain vitamin K," FDA said.  Leaving vitamin K 
out of a substitute food when it is present in the original 
food would make the substitute food nutritionally inferior, 
FDA said. 

The final rule makes the consideration of selenium, 
chromium, molybdenum and chloride optional in determining 
whether a food is nutritionally inferior to a food for which 
it substitutes.

Companies that wish to add the new RDIs to their product's 
nutrition label may do so immediately, FDA said.  Others 
have until Jan. 1, 1997, which corresponds with the 
effective date of DSHEA regulations and should give industry 
time to do the appropriate analysis and implement the 
changes, FDA said.

STRUCTURE/FUNCTION CLAIMS, DISCLAIMER STATEMENTS PROPOSED

One of the key proposals in FDA's triad on dietary 
supplement labeling (See separate stories) would establish 
rules for declaring percentages of nutrients not covered by 
current RDIs or RDAs.  The same proposal, as part of the 
implementation of the Dietary Supplement Health and 
Education Act, would:

-- withdraw a provision of NLEA that dietary supplements of 
vitamins and minerals may not give prominence to any 
ingredient that is not a vitamin or a mineral;

-- specify how the disclaimer required by DSHEA is to be 
presented along with "statements of nutritional support";

-- remove the current NLEA definition of dietary supplements 
in health and nutrient content claims rules.

FDA set a comment deadline of March 13 and proposed an 
effective date of Jan. 1, 1997.

Summarizing in an analysis of impacts which expressed FDA's 
uncertainty as to whether the rule would provide any 
consumer benefit, the agency said, "The proposed rule does 
not significantly change the way in which claims are made, 
with three exceptions: 

"(1) Percentage claims for dietary supplements that do not 
have RDIs or DRVs are no longer prohibited;

"(2) Dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals may now 
highlight an ingredient that is not a vitamin or mineral, 
and

"(3) Labels or labeling of dietary supplements may include 
statements of nutritional support so long as those 
statements include an appropriate disclaimer and the 
manufacturer has substantiation that the statement is 
truthful and not misleading."

New definition

The agency's proposed new definition of the term "dietary 
supplement" in the section on nutrient content claims would 
apply to "foods that are intended for human consumption and 
that are offered for sale, including conventional foods and 
dietary supplements," eliminating the current reference to 
"vitamins, minerals, herbs and other similar nutritional 
substances (dietary supplements)."  The simplification was 
called for by DSHEA, FDA said.  Discussing the coverage of 
the nutrient content proposal, FDA said:

-- "The broad range of substances that can be dietary 
ingredients under Section 201(ff) has the potential to 
create ambiguities as to the coverage of the nutrient 
content claim regime.  With respect to some substances that 
can be dietary ingredients, the context in which statements 
about them are made will determine whether they are nutrient 
content claims or not.  For example, garlic can be the 
dietary ingredient.

-- "A claim on the label or in the labeling of a dietary 
supplement that it is 'high in garlic' or that it 'now 
contains more garlic' is a nutrient content claim within the 
meaning of the act, and the food is misbranded unless such a 
claim has been authorized by FDA through regulation....

-- "On the other hand, a label statement on garlic bread, for 
example, that the product now contains more garlic would not 
be a nutrient content claim if the bread is not labeled as a 
dietary supplement and if it is clear from the context in 
which the claim is made that the claim refers to the taste of 
the product...."

Percentage claims for non-RDI ingredients

FDA noted that DSHEA specifically permitted percentage 
claims for ingredients not covered by Reference Daily 
Intakes (RDIs) or Daily Reference Values (DRVs), using as an 
example "40% omega-3 fatty acids."  DSHEA also would allow 
statements that characterize the percentage of ingredients 
in relation to an equivalent in another food product.  
Examples were "100% of the allicin in a bulb of garlic" or 
"twice the allicin as (product alternative) where 'twice' is 
another way of saying 200%."

"Accordingly," FDA said in the preamble to the proposal, 
"percentage claims such as '40% omega-3 fatty acids' that do 
not in any way characterize the level of a nutrient in terms 
of defined claims such as 'high', 'low' or 'reduced' were 
permitted on dietary supplements as well as conventional 
foods before the enactment of the DSHEA."

The agency said, however, that percentage statements would 
be misleading unless the ingredient is in a meaningful 
amount, continuing:  

"Therefore, firms will need to determine on a case-by-case 
basis whether the stated amount of a dietary ingredient for 
which an RDI or DRV has not been established, and the 
difference between the amount of such a dietary ingredient 
in two products, is meaningful...."

An example:  The statement "300% of the bioflavonoids in a 
large grapefruit" is permissible, but a claim such as "high 
in bioflavonoids" is not.  "FDA has concluded," the agency 
continued, "that if the defined term (i.e., the nutrient 
content claim) is to have any meaning, there must be a level 
that can be used as a reference in determining whether the 
claim is valid and appropriate.  The RDIs and DRVs provide 
such levels.  Thus, FDA has limited the use of 'good 
source', 'high' and other defined terms to use with 
nutrients for which RDIs or DRVs have been established."

FDA said it considers that when a percentage comparison is 
made for ingredients for which no RDI or DRV has been 
established, information on the identity of the reference 
food and on the quantitative amount of the dietary 
ingredient in both products is necessary.  The proposal 
would require that the reference food be clearly identified, 
and the actual amount of the dietary ingredient in both 
foods be provided, adjacent to the most prominent claim or 
to the nutrient label.  When the nutrition label is on the 
information panel, the quantitative information may be 
placed elsewhere on the panel.

Statements of nutritional support

To escape characterization as a drug while making statements 
of nutritional support (so-called structure/function 
claims), manufacturers must, according to the proposal, have 
substantiation that the claim is truthful and not misleading 
and include on the label a disclaimer: 

"This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug 
Administration.  This product is not intended to diagnose, 
treat, cure or prevent any disease."

A plural version of the first sentence would be allowed when 
more than one structure/function claim is made.  

Prominence of the disclaimer is at issue.  Where one 
structure/function claim is made, FDA decided the disclaimer 
must appear immediately adjacent to the claim with no 
intervening material.  When multiple claims are made, 
however, the agency would allow asterisks on the claim, 
referring to a specific place on the label, such as the 
information panel, where the disclaimer would appear.  
Allowing information panel placement, however, must be 
supported by comments, the agency said, noting the receipt 
of a petition on the subject from the Nutritional Health 
Alliance.  The agency said it is concerned that the 
placement of the disclaimer on another panel would not 
reveal material facts in conjunction with the statement of 
nutritional support.  The preamble's discussion continued:

-- "... In addition, the requirement in the act for prominent 
display means that when the disclaimer does not appear 
immediately adjacent to a statement of nutritional support, 
it must be presented on the label or labeling in a manner 
that renders it as readily observable and as likely to be 
read as the statement of nutritional support itself....

-- "Therefore, FDA is proposing in Section 101.94(c)(2) to 
require that a box be drawn around the disclaimer when the 
disclaimer is not immediately adjacent to the statement of 
nutritional support."

Type size and style 

FDA proposed a minimum 1/16th-inch type size for disclaimer 
statements, saying it considers unworkable the NLEA 
provision for letters one half the size of the most 
prominent statement because nutritional support statements 
are likely to be long and, thus, of small type size.

The proposal would remove for dietary supplements the NLEA 
restrictions on use of statements of levels of nutrients 
that are not vitamins or minerals.

FSIS ISSUES FINAL RULE REDUCING PRIOR LABELING APPROVAL 
REQUIREMENTS

The U.S. Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection 
Service has issued its final rule, first proposed in 1992, 
amending the federal meat and poultry products inspection 
regulations by expanding the types of labeling which would 
not require submittal to FSIS for approval prior to use (See 
FLN Nov. 25, 1993, Page 19; Dec. 23, 1993, Page 27; Jan. 27, 
1994, Page 14; February 10, 1994, Page 21, and Aug. 17, 
1995, Page 7) in a notice published Dec. 29 in the Federal 
Register.

The new rule also amends the federal meat and poultry 
products inspection regulations to permit the submission of 
only sketch labeling, except for temporary approvals, in 
those instances where labeling is required to be submitted 
for approval, and to require retention of certain labeling 
records.  This final rule is intended to eliminate 
unnecessary duplication in the labeling approval system and 
contribute to President Clinton's initiatives for greater 
efficiency in government services (as per the principles of 
the National Performance Review to cut red tape, put 
customers first and eliminate what is not needed).  The 
effective date of the rule is July 1, 1996.

The effect of the new rule is that official establishments 
and foreign establishments certified by officials of foreign 
inspection systems will be allowed to use the following 
generically approved labeling without the submission of 
sketches for approval by FSIS:

1. Labeling for a product which has a standard of identity 
or composition as specified in 9 CFR Part 319 or Part 381, 
subpart P, and which does not contain any special claims, 
such as quality claims, nutrient content claims, health 
claims, negative claims, geographical origin claims or 
guarantees, or which is not a domestic product labeled with 
a foreign language;

2. Labeling for single-ingredient products (such as beef 
steak, lamb chops, chicken legs or turkey breasts) which 
does not contain special claims such as quality claims, 
nutrient content claims, health claims, negative claims, 
geographical origin claims or guarantees, or which is not a 
domestic product labeled with a foreign language; 

3. Labeling for products marked "For Export Only" in U.S. 
establishments which does not contain any special claims, 
such as quality claims, nutrient content claims, health 
claims, negative claims, geographical origin claims or 
guarantees;

4. Labeling for containers of meat and meat food products 
and poultry products sold under contract specifications to 
federal government agencies, when such product is not 
offered for sale to the general public, provided the 
contract specifications include specific requirements with 
respect to labeling, and are made available to the IIC;

5. Labeling for shipping containers which contain fully 
labeled immediate containers, provided such labeling 
complies with 9 CFR 316.13 or 381.127. 

6. Labeling for products not intended for human food, 
provided they comply with 9 CFR Part 325 or 9 CFR 
381.152(c) and 381.193, and labeling for poultry heads and 
feet for export for processing as human food if they comply 
with 9 CFR 381.190(b);

7. Inspection legends, which comply with 9 CFR Parts 312 
and 316 and 9 CFR Part 381, subpart M, and 

8. Inserts, tags, liners, pasters, and like devices 
containing printed or graphic matter and for use on, or to 
be placed within, containers and coverings of products, 
provided such devices contain no reference to product and 
bear no misleading feature.

The rule will also permit official establishments and 
foreign establishments certified by officials of foreign 
inspection systems to use final labeling, without further 
authorization from FSIS, that was approved by FSIS, FLD, in 
sketch form if the final labeling was prepared without 
modification or with the following modifications:

1. All features of the labeling are proportionately 
enlarged or reduced, provided that all minimum size 
requirements specified in applicable regulations are met 
and the labeling is legible;

2. A substitution of the abbreviation "lb." for "pound," or 
"oz." for "ounce," or of the word "pound" for "lb." or 
"ounce" for "oz.";

3. A master or stock label has been approved from which the 
name and address of the distributor are omitted and such 
name and address are applied before being used (in such 
case, the words "prepared for" or similar statement must be 
shown together with the blank space reserved for the 
insertion of the name and address when such labels are 
offered for approval);

4. During holiday seasons, wrappers or other covers bearing 
floral or foliage designs or illustrations of rabbits, 
chicks, fireworks, or other emblematic holiday designs are 
used with approved labeling (the use of such designs will 
not make necessary the application of labeling not otherwise 
required);

5. A change in the language or the arrangement of directions 
pertaining to the opening of containers or the serving of 
the product;

6. The addition, deletion or amendment of a dated or undated 
coupon, a cents-off statement, cooking instructions, packer 
product code information or UPC product code information;

7. Any change in the name or address of the packer, 
manufacturer or distributor that appears in the signature 
line;

8. Any change in the net weight, provided the size of the 
net weight statement complies with 9 CFR 317.2 or 381.121;

9. The addition, deletion, or amendment of recipe 
suggestions for the product;

10. Any change in punctuation;

11. Newly assigned or revised establishment numbers for a 
particular establishment for which use of the labeling has 
been approved by the FLD; 

12. The addition or deletion of open dating information;

13. A change in the type of packaging material on which the 
label is printed; 

14. Brand name changes, provided that there are no design 
changes, the brand name does not use a term that connotes 
quality or other product characteristics, the brand name has 
no geographic significance, and the brand name does not 
affect the name of the product;

15. The deletion of the word "new" on new product labeling;

16. The addition, deletion, or amendment of special handling 
statements, such as "Keep Refrigerated" or "Keep Frozen," 
provided that the change is consistent with 9 CFR 317.2(k) 
or 381.125(a);

17. The addition of safe handling instructions as required 
by 9 CFR 317.2(l) or 381.125(b);

18. Changes reflecting a change in the quantity of an 
ingredient shown in the formula without a change in the 
order of predominance shown on the label, provided that the 
change in quantity of ingredients complies with any minimum 
or maximum limits for the use of such ingredients prescribed 
in 9 CFR Parts 318 and 319, or 9 CFR 381.147 or 9 CFR Part 
381, subpart P;

19. Changes in the color of the labeling, provided that 
sufficient contrast and legibility remain;

20. The addition, deletion, or substitution of the official 
USDA grade shield on labels of poultry products;

21. A change in the product vignette, provided the change 
does not affect mandatory labeling information or 
misrepresent the content of the package, or

22. A change in an establishment number by a corporation or 
parent company for an establishment under its ownership.

As originally proposed, the rule had no provision for 
voluntary submission of labeling to FSIS for review and 
approval, and many commenters to the ANPR asked that the 
option be retained because many products have complex 
compositional and minimum content requirements.  The final 
rule now provides for the option of submitting sketch 
labeling for standardized products for review, an option 
FSIS says it may later propose to remove.

According to the Federal Register notice, the role of the 
ICC (inspector in charge) will not change or be diminished 
as a result of this regulation.  Inspection personnel are to 
continue observing and monitoring product formulations and 
processing procedures to assure conformance with general 
labeling requirements.

The regulation is expected to benefit consumers, the meat 
and poultry industry and FSIS itself, streamlining the label 
approval process from two steps (sketch and final) to one 
(sketch only).  Allowing meat and poultry manufacturers to 
make numerous labeling modifications without submitting 
certain labels for approval should, according to the notice, 
reduce the burden on industry by making the process more 
convenient and cost-effective, and save the meat and poultry 
industries (which will be submitting approximately 82,600 
fewer labels a year to FSIS' Food Labeling Division at $37 
per label) at least $3 million annually.

STANDARDS MODIFICATIONS PROPOSED  BY FSIS

With some exceptions, USDA's Food Safety and Inspection 
Service proposed Dec. 29 its expected modifications of food 
standards to allow substitute foods.  An interim policy had 
preceded the proposal (See FLN March 9, Page 16).

A comment deadline was set as Feb. 27, but no effective date 
was noted.

The terms "substitute" or "alternate" would not be required 
in product names for the new products.  FSIS said, "... 
These products will be appropriately named by use of an 
expressed nutrient content claim and the appropriate 
standardized term."

The nutrient content claim, however, would have to be 
presented in the same style, color and size of type as in 
the original product.  

Also, each of the ingredients must be listed, in general, by 
common or usual name in descending order of predominance by 
weight on either the principal display panel or the 
information panel.

Permitted ingredients added at levels in excess of those 
allowed by the traditional standard must be appropriately 
identified as such, FSIS said, with an asterisk in the 
ingredients statement.  FSIS elaborated:

-- "... The statement 'ingredients not in regular (name of 
the traditional standardized food)' or 'ingredients in 
excess of amount permitted in regular (name of the 
traditional standardized food)' or both statements as 
appropriate, shall immediately follow the ingredients 
statement in the same type size. 

-- "The asterisk statements must clearly distinguish between 
'those ingredients not permitted' and 'those ingredients 
used in excess of amounts permitted' in a standardized 
product."

Nutrient content claims would stand in for some requirements 
of current standards under the new definition as proposed by 
FSIS, which said:  "FSIS is proposing to define substitutes 
to processed meat and poultry products as: 

-- "Any processed meat and/or poultry product whose 
formulation has been minimally modified to enable it to be 
used as a substitute for another meat and/or poultry product 
that it resembles and which has a standard of identity in 
the regulations (9 CFR Parts 319 and 381, subpart P).

-- "The meat or poultry product would be eligible to use an 
expressed nutrient content claim to identify it; would 
resemble the standardized product in appearance, form, taste 
and texture, and would use safe, suitable and approved 
substitute ingredients at proper levels and functions, i.e., 
the lowest level necessary to satisfy the criteria for use 
of the expressed nutrient content claim provided in 
regulations."

The product would have to be labeled, according to the 
proposal, "in a manner that conveys allowable ingredient 
differences to consumers."  The agency elaborated:

"The ingredient differences that will be allowed relate to 
the use of ingredients needed to make a product that 
complies with the specific expressed nutrient content claim 
related to a reduction in a constituent that has negative 
health implications ... i.e., fat, cholesterol and sodium.

"The substitute meat or poultry food product will be allowed 
to be named using a standardized term because it either will 
be similar to the standardized product in its performance 
characteristics and the ingredients used, or it will, 
through appropriate labeling terminology, describe how it 
differs from the standardized product for which it 
substitutes."

Taboo practices

The proposal outlined some instances, however, in which 
products will not be considered substitutes for standardized 
products, including:

-- "... Modified versions of standardized products which 
purport to be substitutes of them must adhere to the 
original regulatory standards requirements ... regarding the 
use of meat and poultry from specified anatomical locations, 
the use of a specific kind and/or amount of meat or poultry 
tissue to prepare the product and the use of specified 
processing procedures....

-- "For example, beef stew must contain at least 25% meat 
(i.e., beef).  Since the meat or poultry content of such 
product is integral to its identity, the label for a 
substitute of this product would be false or misleading if 
the substitute was named, in part, by a standardized term, 
but contained less than the amount of meat and/or poultry 
required by the standard....

-- "For example, a product identified with the standardized 
name 'Chicken A-La-King' is required to contain a minimum of 
20% cooked chicken meat and a substitute for this product 
would be required to contain the same amount....

-- "... 'Turkey ham must be made from turkey thigh meat and 
be cured, and in 9 CFR 319.107, 'Bacon' must be made from 
pork bellies and be cured...."

FSIS said it plans to invite comments on a broader reform of 
the standards in an upcoming advance notice of proposed 
rulemaking.

Expressed nutrient content claims

FSIS proposed that "only expressed nutrient content claims, 
i.e., claims that have been defined and are related to 
reductions in constituents having negative health 
implications, be permitted in conjunction with the 
standardized name ... in substitute meat and poultry 
products."  Examples of approved claims were given as "low," 
"lower," "lite," "reduced," "lean," "extra lean" and "free."

Performance characteristics

The substitute foods also must "perform similarly to the 
traditional standardized products," FSIS said, "unless the 
product is specifically labeled to show any significant 
performance usage differences it has, such as a frankfurter 
not being suitable for freezing."

Performance characteristics were listed as including 
physical properties (e.g., texture, cooking qualities, 
freezing qualities), its functional properties (e.g., body, 
spreadability) and shelf life.  However, the agency 
qualified these requirements with:

-- "FSIS recognizes, however, that when a standardized 
product is modified so that its composition accurately 
supports the nutrient content claim intended to be made, it 
may not be possible in all cases to produce a substitute 
product that performs similarly in regard to all uses of the 
regulated standardized meat or poultry food product....

-- "The product would be considered a substitute product 
allowed under this proposal if the limitation on use does 
not affect the fundamental nature of the product and is 
disclosed in labeling....

-- "If there is a difference in performance characteristics 
that materially limits the use of the product, the product 
may still be considered a substitute if the label includes a 
disclaimer adjacent to the most prominent claim in 
accordance with 9 CFR 317.13(d) (1) and (2) and 381.413(d) 
(1) and (2), informing the consumer of such difference...."

Elaborating with the example of a frankfurter having such 
characteristics as a "link" form, a cured pink color, a 
spongy texture and the ability for refrigeration or 
freezing, and the expectation that it could be prepared in a 
variety of ways, i.e., boiling, broiling, grilling and 
frying, FSIS said:

-- "When fat, however, in a frankfurter or another 
standardized product is replaced by one or more other 
ingredients, it may not be possible in all cases to produce 
substitute products that perform identically to the 
traditional standardized meat and poultry products....  Fats 
exhibit unique physical properties in meat and poultry 
products, e.g., their ability to combine with protein to 
form emulsions and their ability to enhance tenderness.  

-- "In order to make a substitute product that qualifies for 
a 'fat free' nutrient content claim, it may be necessary to 
replace fat with water and binders (i.e., additives that 
hold water and protein), which may result in a substitute 
meat or poultry food product with limitations in performance 
related to product uses....

-- "Therefore, if a 'fat free' frankfurter does not tolerate 
frozen storage for long periods of time, because the 
ingredients needed to make the substitute product do not 
withstand the same conditions of storage as the standardized 
product ... a non- performance statement would inform the 
consumer of that fact, e.g., 'Do Not Freeze'."

Tofu taboo

The proposal listed specific allowable and non-allowable 
ingredients.  Listed as allowable, although they have 
typically been restricted in standardized products, were:  
Agar-agar, algin, sodium alginate, calcium carbonate, lactic 
acid and calcium lactate (or glucono delta-lactone), 
calcium-reduced dried skim milk, carrageenan, carboxymethyl 
cellulose (cellulose gum), dried milk, enzyme (rennet)-
treated calcium-reduced dried skim milk and calcium lactate, 
food starch modified, gelatin, guar gum, methyl cellulose, 
isolated soy protein, sodium caseinate, dry or dried whey, 
reduced lactose whey, reduced minerals whey, whey protein 
concentrate, starchy vegetable flour (e.g., potato flour, 
rice flour and pea flour), vegetable starch (e.g., corn 
starch, potato starch and wheat starch), wheat gluten, 
tapioca dextrin, soy flour, soy protein concentrate and 
xanthan gum.

Also, emulsifying agents to be permitted in combination with 
water and binders as part of a fat-replacement system were 
listed as lecithin, mono- and diglycerides and polyglycerol 
esters of fatty acids, commonly used as emulsifying agents 
in shortenings and margarines.  These are not to be 
considered as fat replacers when used alone.

Humectants, also, would not be considered by themselves to 
be fat replacers, but would be allowed as part of a "fat 
replacement system" because of their water-binding 
enhancement.

The proposal is not intended to allow replacement or 
exchange of any required ingredient or component, USDA 
emphasized, specifically listing as taboo under these 
replacement circumstances:  Textured vegetable protein, 
foods such as bread, rice, potatoes, cheese, fruits and 
vegetables.  The preamble to the proposal elaborated:

"Because these food ingredients have virtually no fat, their 
presence in products would result in a finished product with 
a lowered fat content.  However, the lowered fat content 
would be a result of the food 'filling' or 'extending' the 
product rather than as a result of the food merely 
functioning as a fat replacer."

Prohibited ingredients

Ingredients prohibited in standardized foods would be 
prohibited also from the substitute foods, examples being 
poultry kidneys or sex glands in cooked sausages, because 
they are not approved as safe or suitable for use in meat 
and poultry.  FSIS continued, "For example, 9 CFR 
318.7(d)(2) prohibits sorbic acid and its salts from use in 
formulating meat products and, thus, would continue to be 
prohibited in substitute products."

DIETARY GUIDELINES GENERALLY RECEIVE FAVORABLE REVIEWS

The federal government's Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 
described this week as "the gold standard" for good 
nutrition and health, were unveiled Jan. 2 to generally 
favorable reviews by industry and consumer groups.  (The 
full text of the guidelines will be published in the Jan. 11 
FLN.)

The guidelines are little changed from the recommendations  
issued last summer by the Dietary Guidelines Advisory 
Committee (See FLN Aug. 24, Page 3).  For the first time, 
they include information on physical activity and dieting, 
vegetarian diets and recommendations that adults maintain 
their body weight as they age.  The fourth edition also 
includes an expanded section on grains, fruits and 
vegetables.

The guidelines recommend that Americans choose diets with 
plenty of grains, fruits and vegetables; eat a variety of 
foods; balance food consumption with physical activity; use 
moderate amounts of salt, sodium, sugar and alcohol, and 
choose a diet low in fat, saturated fat and cholesterol.  

Industry generally called the guidelines balanced and 
reasonable.  The National Cattlemen's Association and the 
Beef Industry Council said they support them.  "For the 99% 
of Americans who enjoy meat, the Dietary Guidelines for 
Americans tell us we can continue to enjoy it and still be 
healthy," the groups said.

The Grocery Manufacturers of America said, "The Dietary 
Guidelines provide guidance not only to consumers and health 
professionals, but to industry as well.  Many of the 
innovations in 'better-for-you-foods' over the last decade 
have been driven by the dietary guidelines."

Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman and Health and Human 
Services Secretary Donna Shalala said commodity and industry 
groups were "responsive" to the changes in the guidelines.  
Shalala brushed aside criticism that the guidelines are too 
lenient on recommended consumption levels of sugar and fat.

While the Council for Responsible Nutrition called the 
guidelines "a step forward," it said they need revision on 
several points regarding supplements.  The guidelines 
incorrectly state that supplements "usually" are not needed, 
inaccurately imply that the Recommended Dietary Allowances 
are the upper limit of safe nutrient intakes and disregard 
the importance of supplements in achieving recommended 
calcium intakes, said the supplement trade association.

Michael Jacobson, director of the Center for Science in the 
Public Interest, expressed disappointment about the 
guidelines, calling them only a "marginal improvement" from 
the previous edition issued in 1990.  The guidelines offer 
"bland statements" that fail to provide enough direction to 
help Americans improve their diets, he said.  "The 
government should tell people what is the best possible 
diet," he said.

Dr. Andrew Nicholson, director of preventive medicine for 
the Physicians Committee for Responsive Medicine, also said 
the government should have offered more specific nutrition 
and dietary information.  

"It's a placebo," he said of the guidelines, noting he is 
pleased they include information on vegetarian diets.  There 
are some "very positive statements," he said, "but the 
[Dietary Guidelines Advisory] Committee has not had the guts 
to stand up to the American Meat Institute, the pork board 
and the fisheries institutes and say which foods have the 
saturated fat and cholesterol so Americans know how to 
follow the recommendations."  

"The important thing is to talk foods.  Don't talk 
nutrients.  People don't know where to find saturated fat 
and cholesterol," Nicholson said.

HHS Secretary Shalala said 300,000 deaths and $250 billion 
in health costs and lost workdays annually are associated 
with poor diets.

FDA STRIVES FOR CONSISTENCY IN DSHEA NUTRITION LABEL RULES

FDA's proposal for nutrition labeling of dietary supplements 
has sought to balance the specific requirements of the 
Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act with existing 
regulations for nutrition labeling of conventional foods in 
order to achieve some consistency -- especially in format.

In the preamble to the proposal, published Dec. 28, FDA 
acknowledged that despite its desire for consistency in the 
appearance of nutrition information on dietary supplements 
and conventional foods, "the requirements adopted in DSHEA, 
such as the listing of the names and amounts of other 
dietary ingredients and the optional listing of source 
information, necessitate that there be some differences in 
format."  

In order to signal to consumers that nutrition labeling on 
dietary supplements differs from that on conventional foods, 
FDA proposed that the title for the nutrition information be 
"Supplement Facts," rather than the "Nutrition Facts" title 
on conventional foods.  The agency asked for specific 
comment on the appropriateness of this title.

Asking that comments be submitted by March 13, FDA said any 
final rule that is issued based on the proposal would become 
effective Jan. 1, 1997.  It specifically asked for comments 
to focus on the provisions in which changes are being 
proposed from FDA's January 1994 final rule for nutrition 
labeling of dietary supplements that had been published 
under the Dietary Supplement Act of 1992.  After passage of 
DSHEA in October 1994, FDA stayed enforcement of the 
nutrition labeling rule for supplements until it had a 
chance to conform the rule to the specific provisions of 
DSHEA.

'Dietary supplement' term to be part of statement of 
identity

In many cases, FDA found the DSHEA statute to be vague and 
had to guess at its meaning.  For example, the agency noted 
that while DSHEA requires the identity statement "dietary 
supplement" on labels, it did not explicitly address where 
on the food label the term must appear.  However, when 
reading the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act as a whole, FDA 
decided that the term "dietary supplement" needs to appear 
as part of the common or usual name of the food, and 
proposed that the term appear in the statement of identity 
of dietary supplement products.

Use of this term, FDA explained, "will distinguish this 
potentially broad class of products from other types of 
food."  In addition, under the broad DSHEA definition of 
dietary supplement, there may be supplements for which the 
presence of the term "constitutes the primary, if not the 
only, means by which consumers will be able to determine 
that the food is a dietary supplement," the agency said, 
especially when supplements are in other than tablet, 
capsule, powder, softgel, gelcap or liquid form.

FDA concluded that no major changes in the 1994 dietary 
supplement final rule are needed on the listing of dietary 
ingredients for which Reference Daily Intakes and Daily 
Reference Values have been established, and proposed that 
the 14 nutrients that must be listed in the nutrition 
labeling of a conventional food, when present in a 
supplement "in amounts greater than that, can be declared as 
zero," be listed on the nutrition label.  They referred to 
these 14 nutrients as "(b)(2) dietary ingredients," since 
they are listed in proposed Section 101.36(b)(2), and to all 
other dietary ingredients as "other dietary ingredients."

The 1994 dietary supplement rule was silent on the listing 
of the  "subcomponents," such as saturated fat, soluble 
fiber and sugar alcohols that may be declared but are not 
required except when claims about them are made.  Since the 
1994 rule applied only to vitamin and mineral supplements, 
and DSHEA now includes other products such as fiber 
supplements to be covered by the same nutrition labeling 
rules, FDA said it concluded that it is appropriate to 
provide for the optional listing of the subcomponents.  

Subcomponents not already specified in the nutrition 
labeling regulations for conventional foods, such as amino 
acids and omega-3 fatty acids, must be listed as dietary 
ingredients for which RDIs and DRVs have not been 
established, rather than as subcomponents of protein or fat.  
FDA said this would provide more consistency between 
nutrition labeling of supplements and conventional foods and 
would minimize consumer confusion.

Although DSHEA requires that all dietary ingredients and 
their amounts be listed, FDA said that requiring the listing 
of all vitamins and minerals with RDIs or DRVs that are 
present in some products, such as herbal products, would be 
"unduly burdensome" and in conflict with the current rules 
which require the mandatory listing only of sodium, vitamin 
A, vitamin C, calcium and iron.  FDA concluded that it is 
appropriate to follow the approach used for conventional 
foods and to require the  listing of vitamins and minerals 
only when they are added to the product for purposes of 
supplementation or when a claim is made about them.  The 
agency asked for comment on this approach.

Noting that it did not declare in the 1994 dietary 
supplement final rule the amounts of vitamins and minerals 
that do not have to be declared because they are so small, 
FDA said it included an explicit statement in the proposal 
that the amounts of vitamins and minerals corresponding to 
less than 2% of the RDI shall not be declared.  FDA said 
this statement "does not represent a change from the 1994 
dietary supplement final rule but is merely a clarification 
of its provisions."

The proposal specified that protein not be declared in the 
nutrition label of dietary supplements that contain only 
individual amino acids.  FDA said it is misleading to 
declare the protein content in the nutrition label of a 
dietary supplement that contains free amino acids because 
protein, by definition, is composed of chains of amino acids 
connected together by peptide bonds.

Use of the heading "amount per serving" is required as it 
was in the 1994 rule, but the agency proposed to allow it to 
be used either over the column of amounts or the column of 
names of ingredients. Requesting comment on this change, FDA 
said it was proposing flexibility in the placement of the 
heading "because space constraints may make placement over 
the column of amounts impractical in some cases."

FDA proposed that instead of listing calories above the 
column of names, as is the case for conventional foods, they 
be listed first in the column of names, under a bar that 
separates the list from the heading, "amount per serving."  
FDA said that giving calories prominence over other 
nutrients is not appropriate for supplements, which usually 
do not contain many calories.  In addition, this change will 
save space, FDA noted.  

The agency also specified the synonyms that may be added in 
parentheses following the names of the (b)(2) dietary 
ingredients, which is identical to the current regulation on 
synonyms in dietary supplement labeling except that the 
agency proposed to permit the use of "folic acid" as a 
synonym for "folate."  While current nutrition labeling 
rules do not permit the term "folic acid," FDA said this was 
an omission and added that it intends to revise the rule for 
conventional foods to permit the listing of folic acid as a 
synonym for folate.

Quantity declarations to be in column to the right of names 
of nutrients

Since DSHEA allows an optional listing of the source of the 
ingredient, FDA proposed requiring that the quantity of each 
ingredient, per serving, be listed in a column to the right 
of the column of names.  FDA said it considered continuing 
to have the weight of the dietary ingredient placed 
immediately after the name of the ingredient or its source, 
"but tentatively concluded that the wide variation in 
placement that could result when some dietary ingredients 
are listed by name only, while others include the source 
ingredient, would make it difficult for some consumers to 
find the declaration of weight."  FDA asked for comment on 
this decision and its possible impact on space requirements.

FDA noted that the weight declared for any dietary 
ingredient "is to be the weight of the dietary ingredient 
rather than the weight of the source of the dietary 
ingredient."  For example, the agency noted, the weight of 
calcium would be declared for calcium carbonate, rather than 
the weight of calcium carbonate.  

While DSHEA is unclear as to the basis for reporting the 
quantitative information, FDA concluded that it is 
appropriate to require it be provided on a "per serving" 
basis.  Interpreting the provision this way means there need 
only be one list of the quantitative amounts of dietary 
ingredients in a supplement, FDA pointed out.  Requiring 
information on a per dosage unit basis might mean that for 
dietary supplements whose serving size is two capsules, 
there would have to be two lists of dietary ingredient 
amounts, one per capsule and the other per serving, which 
would result in overcrowded labels.  However, "the rules of 
statutory construction" do not generally favor the FDA 
interpretation, the agency acknowledged, since it would make 
two sections of the act redundant, and specifically 
requested comment on its proposed interpretation.

Discussing the declaration of percent daily values for each 
(b)(2) dietary ingredient,  FDA said it clarified that the 
actual amount is to be used in the calculation for vitamins 
and minerals, except sodium and potassium, and that either 
the actual amount or the rounded amount may be used for 
other nutrients, such as fat.  FDA said it also reworded a 
provision to make clear that the phrase "less than 1%" is to 
be used when the dietary ingredient is present in an amount 
by weight that requires declaration, yet the amount is so 
small that the percent Daily Value when rounded to the 
nearest percent comes to "0%." 

'Less than' symbol may be used, FDA says

The symbol "<1%" may be used in place of "less than 1%" to 
provide more flexibility when space is limited on the label, 
FDA said, noting that it did not permit the use of the 
symbol in the first set of nutrition labeling regulations 
because of concerns that many people would not understand 
its meaning.  However, the agency said it has received 
numerous requests for its use "and is aware that it is being 
used on some nutrition labels with tight space constraints."  
FDA asked for comments on use of the symbol "and the 
submission of any available data that would demonstrate 
consumers' comprehension of it." 

If FDA permits the use for dietary supplements, it intends 
to provide for such use on conventional foods as well, the 
agency said.

The column for "% Daily Value" may be omitted when there are 
no numerical values declared beneath it, FDA said.  When 
this happens, and the footnote "Daily Value not established" 
is required, the asterisk symbol must immediately follow the 
quantitative amount by weight for each dietary ingredient 
listed under "amount per serving," FDA said.

In considering requirements for the listing of other dietary 
ingredients, FDA proposed that they be listed in the 
nutrition label by their common or usual name in a column 
that is underneath the column of names of (b)(2) dietary 
ingredients and that a "heavy bar" be used to separate the 
listing, which would enable consumers to distinguish between 
the two types of ingredients.

Comments requested on order of dietary ingredients listings

While FDA said it considered specifying that the other 
dietary ingredients be listed in a particular order, such as 
alphabetical order or descending order of predominance by 
weight, FDA said it tentatively concluded that specifying a 
particular order is not justified, but requested comments on 
the issue.

For herbs and other botanicals, FDA encouraged manufacturers 
to use common or usual names that are found in botanical 
data bases and that are widely used. While many of these 
names "are part of our everyday language and are easily 
recognized," FDA acknowledged that arriving at an 
appropriate name for botanicals "may be a problem because 
some plants have more than one common or usual name, or one 
name is used to describe many different species."  In other 
cases, a particular species may not even have a common or 
usual name, the agency said.  FDA said it considers the term 
"botanical" to include fungi and algae.

FDA proposed to require that the quantitative amount listed 
in the nutrition label for a declared dietary ingredient be 
the total weight of that dietary ingredient and not the 
weight of a component of that dietary ingredient or of the 
source of that dietary ingredient.  For example, if a 
dietary supplement lists garlic as a dietary ingredient and 
makes no reference to a component of garlic, then the weight 
specified should be the weight of garlic.  However, if the 
nutrition label lists allicin as the dietary ingredient, 
with the garlic noted as the source ingredient, the weight 
specified ought to be the weight of allicin only.  Liquid 
extracts of dietary ingredients "are not to be treated any 
differently," FDA said, noting that such determinations may 
be difficult and asking for comment on the issue.

FDA said it is giving the manufacturer the option of 
deciding what to list as a dietary ingredient, noting that 
either the botanical or one or more constituents of a 
botanical may be declared as the dietary ingredient.  FDA 
requested comment on whether it should consider allowing 
manufacturers to declare both the botanical and one or more 
constituents as dietary ingredients within a single product, 
with a requirement that the constituents of the botanical be 
indented beneath the listing of the botanical.  FDA said it 
rejected this approach because it could be potentially 
confusing to consumers, but asked whether there are 
alternative approaches and whether this flexibility is 
consistent with DSHEA.

The agency proposed to require that manufacturers express 
the amounts of other dietary ingredients in metric units 
that are appropriate.  The provision requires that any 
declaration of 1,000 or more units be declared in the next 
higher set of units.

Other dietary ingredients must bear an asterisk in the 
column under the heading of "% Daily Value" that refers to 
another symbol placed at the bottom of the nutrition label 
that is followed by the statement, "Daily Value not 
established."  When no (b)(2) dietary ingredients are 
declared and the heading of "% Daily Value" is not used, the 
agency proposed that the symbol follow the declaration of 
the quantitative amount for each dietary ingredient listed.  

FDA said it gave "extensive consideration" to the most 
appropriate wording for the statement to which the symbol 
refers, considering statements such as "not currently 
determined essential," which was suggested by a dietary 
supplement trade association.  FDA said it is "unsure if 
such a statement would be more useful to consumers," but 
noted that the "Daily value not established" statement is 
consistent with that currently used on nutrition labels, and 
asked for comments on an appropriate statement.

Provision outlines requirements for proprietary blends

A section of the regulation provides for the listing of 
dietary ingredients in proprietary blends, in order to 
implement the DSHEA provision that permits the listing of 
the total quantity of all ingredients in a blend labeled 
proprietary.  FDA proposed that the dietary ingredients in 
the proprietary blend be indented under the term 
"proprietary blend," or a modification of the term, and be 
listed in a column or in a linear fashion.

The proposal would require that the total weight of the 
dietary ingredients listed as components of the proprietary 
blend appear on the same line as the name of the blend, to 
make it clear that the weight represents the total weight of 
the dietary ingredients listed.   The proposal also requires 
that the list of other dietary ingredients in a proprietary 
blend be given in order of predominance by weight, since the 
weights of the individual dietary ingredients need not be 
specified.  FDA noted that this is consistent with 
ingredient labeling of conventional foods and "is intended 
to give consumers an indication of the relative amounts of 
the other dietary ingredients present in the absence of 
information on their actual amounts."

If the proprietary blend furnishes more than insignificant 
amounts of any required (b)(2) dietary ingredient, that 
ingredient must be declared, as well as the amount of the 
ingredient and the percent of the Daily Value, FDA said.  
The agency said it would be contrary to the Nutrition 
Labeling and Education Act not to require such a listing.

Dietary ingredients in nutrition label exempt from 
ingredient declaration

While noting some ambiguity in the statute, FDA said it 
interpreted DSHEA to mean that any ingredient listed in the 
nutrition label need not be listed a second time in the 
ingredient statement.  FDA proposed to revise its 
regulations on ingredient listings to allow for this, citing 
a legal analysis from the law firm of Covington and Burling 
that agrees with its interpretation.

FDA proposed that the source of any dietary ingredient may 
be added in parentheses immediately following or indented 
beneath the name of the dietary ingredient, and the words 
"as" or "from" must precede the name of the source 
ingredient, such as "calcium (as calcium carbonate)."  If 
the name of the dietary ingredient is itself the source 
ingredient or its synonym, then the listing of the dietary 
ingredient will fulfill the requirement for the listing of 
the ingredient, the agency explained.  Noting that many 
manufacturers already use the terms "as" or "from," FDA said 
these words will help to convey to consumers the 
understanding that such compounds are the source of the 
dietary ingredients.

When a source is not identified within the nutrition label, 
the proposal provides that it shall be listed in the 
ingredient statement.  The ingredient statement on a dietary 
supplement must appear outside and immediately below the 
nutrition label, or, if there is insufficient space below 
the nutrition label, immediately contiguous and to the right 
of the nutrition label, FDA said.  This provision is in 
accordance with DSHEA, the agency explained.

The agency proposed to require that the ingredients list be 
preceded by the word "Ingredients," unless some ingredients 
are identified within the nutrition label, in which case the 
ingredients listed outside the nutrition label shall be in a 
list preceded by the words "Other Ingredients."   This will 
indicate to consumers that some ingredient information 
appears in the nutrition information that precedes the 
ingredient list, FDA said.

Ingredients that are not dietary ingredients, such as 
fillers and artificial colors, must be listed in the 
ingredient statement, FDA said, noting that a 1942 Trade 
Correspondence which had exempted such ingredients from 
dietary supplement declaration is being revoked since it has 
been overturned by more recent agency statements of policy 
on the subject.

Latin form of botanicals in parentheses required for 
ingredients

Ingredients would have to be listed by common or usual name, 
as is required for conventional foods. In order to ensure 
correct identification of herbs or other botanicals, 
including algae and fungi, FDA proposed that the botanical 
name in Latin binomial form be included in parentheses 
following the common or usual name.  To ensure there is 
consistency and clarity in declaration, the agency proposed 
that any botanical name declared should be "in accordance 
with internationally accepted rules on nomenclature, such as 
those found in the International Code of Botanical 
Nomenclature," FDA said, requesting comments on this issue.

Recognizing that it is possible to have more than one 
acceptable botanical name in Latin form, FDA advised 
manufacturers "to choose the name that is most currently 
used in commerce and in appropriate references and, in cases 
of confusion, to consult with the agency."

FDA also proposed to require that the part or parts of the 
plant, such as leaf, flower, root, fruit, seed or bark, be 
presented in parentheses immediately following the Latin 
name of the botanical ingredient, noting that DSHEA requires 
identification of any part of the plant from which the 
dietary ingredient is derived.  Whenever such information is 
presented, the agency said, the name of the part of the 
plant must be expressed in English, since the pharmaceutical 
names would not be recognized and their meanings would not 
be commonly understood by American consumers.  "When the 
entire plant is used, the label should specify 'entire 
plant' to meet the requirements of the act," FDA said.

The botanical name requirements apply whether the 
ingredient is listed in an ingredient statement or in the 
nutrition label, FDA said.  Since the FD&C Act does not 
require ingredients to be listed when the food contains 
only one ingredient, FDA proposed that for single-
ingredient dietary supplements, the Latin binomial name and 
the part of the plant from which the dietary supplement is 
derived may be prominently placed on the principal display 
panel or the information panel, or included in the 
nutrition label.

When two or more sources are listed within parentheses, 
they should be listed in descending order by weight, "which 
is consistent with the way ingredients are to be listed" in 
the ingredient labeling regulations, FDA said.  Since the 
amounts by weight of the ingredients are listed in the 
nutrition label, these ingredients did not have to be 
listed in descending order by weight, the agency noted.

Reference to official compendium permitted for individual 
ingredients

Individual dietary ingredients that conform to an official 
compendium may be listed as such by a reference to the 
compendium, FDA said, citing as an example "Calcium (from 
carbonate USP)."  If such a representation is made and the 
ingredient does not comply with the specifications of the 
compendium, the supplement would be misbranded, the agency 
noted.

Discussing format requirements, FDA said it is proposing to 
maintain the same graphic requirements in the nutrition 
labeling regulations, including those on type size, since 
DSHEA does not necessitate any changes in type size.  FDA 
requested comment on the requirement for a hairline rule 
between the listings of each dietary ingredient, noting that 
it had received complaints about the hairline rule's effect 
on space and legibility on supplements with a long listing 
of ingredients when this requirement was issued in the 1994 
regulations.  Such comments "will be particularly helpful if 
actual sample labels are included as well as suggestions for 
when relief from such a requirement should be provided," FDA 
said.

The proposal clarified the size of bars that are to be used 
to separate the various headings, FDA said, noting that 
there was confusion about this issue when the 1994 rule was 
published.

A section of the proposal addressing how nutrition 
information is to be presented on products that contain two 
or more separately packaged dietary supplements is analogous 
to the section in the regulations for conventional foods, 
FDA said.

Compliance will be determined using the procedures for 
nutrition labeling of conventional foods, according to the 
proposal.  FDA discussed whether to alter its longstanding 
compliance criterion requiring added vitamins, minerals, 
protein, dietary fiber or potassium to be present in amounts 
at least equal to the value for the declared nutrient, since 
USP monographs for several nutrition products require a 
minimum nutrient content of 90% of the label declaration.  
FDA said any deviation from the criterion that is 
attributable to reasons other than variability of analytical 
methods would be a material fact that would need to be 
disclosed on the label, and 

said such a message could diminish consumer confidence.  The 
agency also confirmed that it is keeping its 80% criterion 
of the declared value for calories, sugars, total fat, 
saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium.

FDA requested comments on appropriate analytical methods for 
dietary ingredients for which official methods do not exist, 
and also asked about information on organizations that 
establish such procedures.

Discussing exemptions, FDA noted that it proposed a rule in 
March 1994 to establish a new exemption for low-volume food 
products from manufacturers, packers, distributors and 
retailers that are small businesses, and said it is 
proposing to cross-reference the small business exemption 
already in the nutrition labeling rule along with the 
proposed exemption.  The rule also incorporates the 
exemption for foods shipped in bulk that are not distributed 
to consumers, and cross-references special labeling 
provisions in the nutrition labeling rules for smaller type 
size for supplements in small and intermediate-sized 
containers.

FDA said it has also cross-referenced the special provisions 
to allow the use of 4.5 point type size on packages with 
less than 12 square inches of available label space and the 
use of six-point type on packages with 12 to 40 square 
inches of label space. 

Multi-ingredient products may use smaller type size, FDA 
says

In response to a petition from a trade association, FDA 
proposed to provide additional flexibility for multi-
ingredient dietary supplements in packages with less than 20 
square inches of available label space.

The agency said it was persuaded by the petition that it is 
not feasible to use six-point type on many products 
containing multiple dietary ingredients on such packages, 
and concluded that it is reasonable to require the six-point 
type on packages with 12 to 20 square inches of available 
label space to bear labeling when eight or fewer dietary 
ingredients are used.  The use of a smaller type size of at 
least 4.5 points could be used when there are more than 
eight dietary ingredients.  Without smaller type, more than 
30% of the total surface area of the package would have to 
be devoted to FDA-required information, the agency 
explained.

FDA said the trade association had surveyed its member 
companies, who agreed that eight or 10 would be an 
appropriate cutoff number, triggering the smaller type size 
for multi-nutrient products.

Primary container must bear nutrition labeling, even in 
small type

A special labeling provision was proposed in the rule for 
supplements in packages that have a surface area of 40 or 
less square inches available to bear labeling.  FDA said 
under the provision, when the nutrition information on 
packages of this size is presented on a label panel other 
than the principal display or information panels, the 
ingredient information must move in conjunction with the 
nutrition label.  In addition, for supplements of this size, 
when it is not possible for primary inner containers to 
comply with the type size requirements, the agency proposed 
that type as small as needed may be used in the nutrition 
label as long as the primary container is securely enclosed 
in outer packaging that bears nutrition labeling in the 
required type size.

FDA noted that in the 1994 rule, it "erroneously advised 
that it considered outer packaging that securely encloses a 
primary container and that is not intended to be separated 
from the primary container under conditions of retail sale 
to be the equivalent of the product label."  FDA said these 
statements were inconsistent with the FD&C Act, and 
therefore nutrition labeling is required to appear on the 
label of the primary container.

While cross-referencing current misbranding provisions for 
foods, FDA proposed to delete two provisions currently in 
Section 101.9(k) that conflict with DSHEA.  One provision 
states that a food is misbranded if the labeling suggests or 
implies that a balanced diet of ordinary foods cannot supply 
adequate amounts of nutrients.  FDA acknowledged that 
scientific and consensus groups have agreed that there are 
certain situations in which the use of dietary supplements 
may be needed for persons to obtain adequate nutrient 
intakes, such as pregnant women or the elderly.  

The other provision, which states that a food is misbranded 
when the labeling implies that the food has special dietary 
properties when such properties are of no significant value 
or need in human nutrition, would conflict with DSHEA, which 
permits statements of nutrition support, according to FDA.

FDA says nutrition labeling would cost $52 to $85 million to 
implement

Discussing the economic impact of the rule, FDA said it 
would cost manufacturers between $52 and $85 million to 
implement.  The agency requested comment on whether dietary 
supplement products will undergo analytical testing as a 
result of the regulations, noting that FDA assumes that 
manufacturers of vitamin and mineral supplements are already 
aware of the nutritional content of their products.  It is 
possible, however, that herbal and other botanical products 
may undergo additional testing, FDA noted, estimating that 
between 4,000 and 20,000 products may undergo testing once 
every five years.

If adopted, the rule "will benefit consumers by ensuring 
that nutrition labeling is provided on dietary supplements 
in a manner that will help consumers to follow healthy 
dietary practices," FDA said.

FDA estimated that the majority of manufacturers of dietary 
supplements meet the Small Business Administration definition 
of a small business because they have fewer than 750 
employees. Noting the exemptions from mandatory nutrition 
labeling proposed for small businesses in the rule, FDA said 
some botanical product manufacturers will have unit sales and 
firm sizes low enough to meet the definition for low-volume 
products.  FDA asked for information on the impact of the 
regulation on small firms.  It noted that the estimated cost 
of the nutrition labeling regulations is 1% to 3% of industry 
annual sales, which range from $2.9 to more than $4 billion.  
"In relation to the volume of sales, this amount does not 
appear to represent a significant cost," the agency said.

FDA also solicited comments on whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper 
performance of the functions of the agency, under the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. Comments on information 
collection must be sent "by Jan. 29, 1996, but no later than 
Feb. 26, 1996" to the Office of Information and Regulatory 
Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget.

FDA SUPPLEMENT PROPOSAL DEFINES 'HIGH POTENCY ANTIOXIDANT' 
TERMS

The Food and Drug Administration's implementation of the 
Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act will include 
definitions for the claims "high potency" and "sugar free" 
used in supplement labeling, as well as the term 
"antioxidant" when used in nutrient content claims on labels 
of dietary supplements and conventional foods (See separate 
stories).

In one of three proposals published Dec. 28, the agency chose 
to limit the term "high potency" to supplement labels rather 
than permit the claim to be used in connection with 
conventional foods, noting that the term is rarely used in 
food labeling.  "In contrast, the term 'high potency' was in 
widespread use on the labels of dietary supplements before 
the enactment of the 1990 (nutrition labeling) amendments, 
continues to be used on dietary supplements, and appears to 
convey information to the consumer about the level of 
nutrients in dietary supplements," FDA said.

The agency said it has tentatively concluded that 100% of 
the Reference Daily Intake per serving is a "reasonable 
definition" for the term because that level is high enough 
"to meet the needs of practically all healthy people."  FDA 
emphasized, however, that this does not mean that the agency 
is opposed to the presence of nutrients exceeding the 100% 
of RDI level.  FDA went on:

"Manufacturers can formulate and describe the level of a 
nutrient as multiples of the RDI (e.g., using the terminology 
'Daily Value' to represent RDIs on the label, a vitamin C 
tablet containing 500 mg would declare '833% of the Daily 
Value of vitamin C').  Nonetheless, because the purpose of 
nutrient content claims is to assist consumers in maintaining 
healthy dietary practices, and given the recommendations of 
the NAS (National Academy of Sciences) on which the RDIs are 
based, FDA tentatively concludes that it is appropriate to 
tie a 'high potency' claim to the RDI itself."

In addition to the nutrients for which RDIs have been 
established, FDA proposed to permit "high potency" claims to 
describe protein and fiber, both of which are measured with 
Daily Values.  Those nutrients must be present at 100% of the 
DRV per reference amount customarily consumed in order to 
qualify for the claim.

The agency added that it would not propose to allow the claim 
to be used for nutrients such as total fat, saturated fat, 
sodium, cholesterol, total carbohydrate and potassium.  
Tablets containing 100 mg or more of potassium are considered 
drugs, according to FDA.

Agency sets "two-thirds" standard for multivitamins

Addressing the subject of using the "high potency" claim on 
labels for multivitamins, FDA stated:  "FDA tentatively 
concludes that it is not necessary to prohibit the use of a 
'high potency' claim on multinutrient dietary supplements if 
the supplements do not contain 100% or more of the RDI for 
each vitamin and mineral that is present, or 100% of the DRV 
for protein or dietary fiber when present.  The agency is 
persuaded by the comments that the public will be better 
served from a public health perspective if some nutrients are 
allowed to be present in such products at levels that are 
below 100% of the RDI or DRV."

"Without such an allowance," the agency said, "those 
nutrients that cannot be included at 100% levels because of 
technological difficulties could not be included at all if 
the dietary supplement is to bear a 'high potency' claim.  
The exclusion of these nutrients will not necessarily help 
consumers to engage in healthy dietary practices."

The agency said that out of the 33 nutrients for which RDIs 
and DRVs have been established, there are 11 nutrients 
(calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, dietary fiber, total 
carbohydrate, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, 
chloride and potassium) for which it would be "impracticable 
or imprudent" to require that they adhere to the 100% 
RDI/DRV threshold.  This amounts to one-third of the total 
nutrients, the agency noted.

"Accordingly, the agency believes that it would be 
reasonable to expect that the remaining two-thirds of the 
nutrients for which RDIs and DRVs have been established 
could be present at 100% of the RDI or DRV in a dietary 
supplement product that contained all 33 nutrients for which 
RDIs and DRVs have been established," the agency said.

FDA then agreed to expand the two-thirds standard to include 
products that do not contain all 33 nutrients for which DRIs 
or DRVs have been established.  "FDA tentatively concludes 
that two-thirds represents a reasonable standard; it 
provides flexibility for supplements that do not contain all 
33 nutrients, and it provides a consistent standard for all 
supplement products.  Finally, it is a familiar fraction 
that is easy to use," the agency said, continuing:

"With a two-thirds standard, the manufacturer would have the 
latitude to decide, in formulating a product that will 
qualify to bear a 'high potency' claim, which nutrients to 
include at 100% of the RDI or DRV."

FDA went on:  "The agency recognizes that dietary 
supplements that consist of an assortment of dietary 
ingredients are widely available in the marketplace.  FDA 
agrees with the comment that stated that the presence or 
absence of dietary ingredients for which RDIs or DRVs have 
not been established (e.g., omega-3 fatty acids, choline, 
boron) ... should not affect the claim so long as those 
nutrients with RDIs or DRVs are present at levels required 
for the claim."

"It is important to note that because the definition that 
FDA is proposing is based on the presence of a nutrient at 
100% of the RDI or DRV, dietary supplements that do not 
contain nutrients for which RDIs or DRVs have been 
established will not be able to use the term 'high 
potency,'" the agency said.

FDA also requested comment on whether "full potency" or 
similar wording may be used as a synonym for "high potency."

FDA addresses nutrient content claims for antioxidants

The agency also proposed to define the term "antioxidant" as 
a collective term for vitamin C, vitamin E and beta-carotene 
when used in nutrient content claims (such as "good source of 
antioxidants") on labels for supplements or conventional 
foods.

"The levels of vitamin C and vitamin E and the level of 
vitamin A present as beta-carotene in the food that bears 
the claim must all be sufficient to qualify for the claim 
(i.e., for 'high in antioxidants,' the product must contain 
20% or more of the RDI for vitamin C and vitamin E per 
reference amount customarily consumed, and 20% or more of 
the RDI for vitamin A must be present as beta-carotene per 
reference amount customarily consumed)," FDA said, 
continuing:

"The term 'antioxidants' may only be used on the label or in 
labeling of a food that does not contain each of the three 
antioxidants ... in sufficient amounts to qualify for the 
claim if the food contains at least one of these nutrients at 
the requisite level, and the claim discloses which 
antioxidants in the food meet the required level (e.g., 'High 
in antioxidant vitamins C and E)."

The agency added that a "collective claim" about antioxidant 
nutrients -- such as "complete antioxidant formula" or 
"antioxidant complex" -- may be used in labeling provided that 
the vitamins are present at 10% or more of the RDI per 
reference amount customarily consumed.

Agency corrects "sugar free" omission

Finally, FDA corrected an inadvertent regulatory omission that 
barred certain supplement products from making "sugar free" 
and "no sugar" claims.  "Section 101.60(c)(1) states that 
consumers may reasonably be expected to regard terms that 
represent that the food contains no sugars or sweeteners as an 
indication that a product is low in calories or is 
significantly reduced in calories," FDA said.

The agency referred to its 1994 nutrient content claims final 
rule, in which FDA added a paragraph to Section 101.60(a) to 
state that "calorie free" and "low calorie" claims may not be 
made on dietary supplement products, "except when an 
equivalent amount of a dietary supplement that the labeled 
food resembles and for which it substitutes (e.g., another 
protein supplement) normally exceeds the definition for 'low 
calorie' in Section 101.60(b)(2)."  FDA continued:

"This change in Sections 101.13(b)(5) and 101.60(a)(4) had the 
unintended effect of limiting the use of 'sugar free' or 'no 
sugar' claims on dietary supplements that would otherwise meet 
the requirements for 'low calorie' in Section 101.60(b)(2) but 
are not permitted to bear the 

claim because they do not substitute for a similar dietary 
supplement that normally exceeds the definition for 'low 
calorie.'"

"Therefore, FDA is proposing to revise Section 
101.60(c)(1)(iii)(A) to excuse only dietary supplements that 
otherwise meet the definition of 'low calorie' under Section 
101.60(b)(2), but that are prohibited by Sections 101.13(b)(5) 
and 101.60(a)(4) from bearing the claim," the agency said.

The comment deadline is March 13, 1996.  "The agency proposes 
that any final rule that may issue based upon this proposal 
become effective Jan. 1, 1997," FDA said.

WARNING LABEL ON CURED MEATS SOUGHT IN PETITION TO FSIS

Jeremy Rifkin's Foundation on Economic Trends and the 
Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine have filed a 
petition with USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service 
seeking removal of the "wholesomeness" seal, stronger language 
on safe handling labels and a warning label on cured meat 
products.

USDA received the petition Oct. 26 but did not place it on 
file in the hearing clerk's office until recently.  The groups 
had been considering suing USDA to stop use of the 
"wholesomeness" seal; the petition cited legal precedents and 
the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) as the basis for the 
groups' claims.

The petition, written by FET's Theodore Waugh and the 
Physicians Committee's Andrew Nicholson, cited the risk to 
consumers from E. coli O157:H7 as the basis for the groups' 
requests.  "The risk of serious permanent physical injury and 
death, USDA's inability to safeguard the meat supply and the 
lack of medical preparedness indicate both the seriousness and 
extent of the E. coli problem," the petition said, adding, 
"Until effective control measures are developed to eliminate 
E. coli contamination, USDA needs to take further actions to 
protect consumers and conform with its statutory obligations."

The petitioners misstated the scope of USDA's declaration that 
E. coli O157:H7 was an adulterant.  The USDA declaration 
applied only to raw ground beef; the petition said that "USDA 
has determined that E. coli-contaminated meats are 
'adulterated.'"

The petition quoted the FMIA as saying, "It is essential in 
the public interest that the health and welfare of consumers 
be protected by assuring that meat and meat food products 
distributed to them are wholesome, not adulterated ..."

"Thus, according to USDA's own regulations, only meats lacking 
E. coli contamination can be labeled 'Inspected and Passed,'" 
the petition said, adding, "Because the FMIA prohibits 
misleading and false labeling, the USDA must remove the 
'Inspected and Passed' labels from meat products until it can 
conclusively determine that the meat is uncontaminated with the 
adulterant E. coli."

Nicholson and Waugh said that USDA's baseline survey of steers 
and heifers found that "approximately 15% of all raw beef 
samples contain one or more species of pathogens."

The petition also said that USDA has admitted that its 
sampling program for E. coli O157:H7 in raw ground beef 
"cannot eliminate E. coli from the food supply."

"It is clear the number of outbreaks has remained high or 
continued to grow, even with USDA's safe care and handling 
labels," the groups said, adding, "In light of the continuing 
number of E. coli outbreaks, it is necessary for USDA to 
improve the current safe handling labels."

The labels should state the consequences of undercooking, 
the petition said, adding:

"How can consumers adapt their behavior to meet the seriousness 
of the health risk when they are uninformed of the potential 
consequences?  For all a purchaser knows, the only illness 
resulting from contamination is an upset stomach.  If 
individuals knew that kidney failure and death were potential 
side effects, they would take the warnings with the degree of 
seriousness that the hazard requires."

The petitioners recommended a new safe handling label that 
would begin:  "WARNING:  This product may contain E. coli 
bacteria, which can cause serious illness, including:  death, 
strokes, seizures, bloody diarrhea, renal failure, red blood 
cell destruction."  Anyone suffering from abdominal cramps or 
diarrhea a few days after consumption should consult a 
physician immediately, the proposed label said.  The proposed 
label also stated that the product should be cooked until no 
red color remains, to a minimum temperature of 155 F.  The 
labels should be bigger and in larger type than the current 
ones, the petitioners said.

They called for a similar warning for cured meat products, 
noting that "it has become clear that E. coli contamination 
can survive the curing process. ... In light of this potential 
danger, USDA should warn consumers of cured meat's potential 
dangers, and at the very least, the agency must remove the 
'Inspected and Passed' labels from cured meat products until 
it can be certain that the meat is not adulterated with E. 
coli."

"If USDA ignores this request, the agency will have acted in an 
arbitrary and capricious manner in violation of the 
Administrative Procedure Act," the petitioners said.  ((6FLN

ORE-IDA DEVELOPS SNACK ZONES FOR MINI-MEALS

01/04/96 - Boise, ID -- Ore-Ida Foods announced that as a consequence
of the busy lifestyles that people today are leading, eating habits are
changing. This is causing more people to eat on the run and consume
several mini-meals throughout the day, creating "the fourth meal"
occasion. This trend is also evident in restaurant settings, where more
and more families are ordering an array of appetizers instead of full
entrees. In order to capitalize on these trends, Ore-Ida Foods has helped
retailers develop a destination shopping section in grocery store frozen
food aisles across the country. This section, known as the "Snack Zone,"
is anchored by Ore-Ida frozen snacks such as Bagel Bites, Cheese Bites
and Dyna Bites. The philosophy underpinning the "Snack Zone" is to
position an assortment of frozen snack items together in one section so
busy shoppers can easily find satisfying and nutritional snacking
solutions for parties, after school or the midnight munchies. Boise, ID
based Ore-Ida Foods is an affiliate of the H.J. Heinz Company and one
of North America's largest frozen food processors.

WENDY'S COMPLETES MERGER WITH TIM HORTONS

01/04/96 - Dublin, OH -- Wendy's International, Inc. has completed the
merger with Tim Hortons, a privately-owned Canadian restaurant chain of
nearly 1,200 units. Wendy's agreed to issue 16.45 million shares of
common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Hortons'
Canadian parent company. The transaction will be treated as a pooling-
of-interests. Tim Hortons has 1,170 company and franchise restaurants,
primarily in Canada. It is Canada's largest national chain in the coffee
and fresh baked goods segment, and second largest in the quick service
industry. The merger is a continuation of a successful business
relationship begun in 1992 when Wendy's and Tim Hortons first built a
combo unit - a freestanding building with a shared dining room and
separate kitchens and staffs. Development costs are about 25% less for
each than traditional units. About 35 combo units are open, with plans for
at least 30 more in 1996.

East Brunswick facility will be consolidated at IBC bakeries in nearby
Philadelphia, PA and Jamaica, NY. Distribution and sales operations will
continue in East Brunswick without change. The 30 year old East

FOODQUEST TO REVIEW STRATEGIES LEADING TO THE SALE OF
ALL OF ITS KENNY ROGERS ROASTER'S RESTAURANTS

01/02/96 - North Miami, FL -- FOODQUEST, Inc. announced that the
Board of Directors has decided to review various strategies leading to the
sale of all of its Kenny Rogers Roaster's concept restaurants to potential
third parties. FOODQUEST will immediately engage an outside valuation
consultant to determine the potential value of these concept units in the
marketplace. Pursuant to this strategy change, the Company has held
discussions with Roasters Corp., the franchisor of Kenny Rogers
Roasters, and has received indications that Roasters Corp. would be
willing to purchase some or all of the Roasters concept units previously
sold and financed by Roasters for a purchase price equal to net book
value, subject to certain other conditions of closing.  The Board believes
that it is in the best interest of shareholders to offer the assets to third
parties as well, so as to receive the highest potential valuation for these
assets. The Company will continue to aggressively pursue and negotiate
for acquisition or merger candidates, such as the recent Paradise Bakery
acquisition target, that offer the best potential for net income growth and
maximization of shareholder value.

21 CFR Part 101
[Docket No. 95P-0197]
RIN 0910-AA19

ACTION: Proposed rule.

SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to
authorize the use, on food labels and in food labeling, of health claims on
the association between oat products, i.e., oat bran and oatmeal, and
reduced risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). FDA is proposing this
action in response to a petition filed by the Quaker Oats Co. (the
petitioner). The agency has tentatively concluded that, based on the
totality of publicly available scientific evidence, diets high in oatmeal and
oat bran and low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of
CHD.

permit is to allow Hershey to collect data on consumer acceptance of a
different product, containing white chocolate, that also contains
chocolate cookies, and to identify mass production problems.

AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS.

ACTION: Proposed rule.

SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to
amend its regulations to define the term "high potency" as a nutrient
content claim for dietary supplements; define the term "antioxidant"
for use in nutrient content claims on labels or in labeling of dietary
supplements and conventional foods; and correct an omission pertaining
to the use of "sugar free" claims on dietary supplements. FDA is taking
these actions to provide for the use of additional nutrient content claims
in response to provisions of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of
1990. This proposed rule will benefit consumers by providing established
definitions for use in food labeling for the terms "high potency,"
"antioxidant," and "sugar free."

Food Labeling; Final Rule and Proposed Rules
[[Page 67164]]

[Docket No. 90N-0134]
RIN 0910-AA19

AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS.

ACTION: Final rule.

SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending its
regulations to establish Reference Daily Intakes (RDI's) for vitamin K,
selenium, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, and chloride, but not for
fluoride. The agency is also amending its regulations to modify the units
of measure that are used to declare the amount of biotin, folate, calcium,
and phosphorus in food. In addition, the agency is amending its
regulations to make consideration of selenium, chromium, molybdenum,
and chloride optional in making a determination as to whether a food is
nutritionally inferior to a food for which it substitutes and that it
resembles. These actions are intended to assist consumers in
understanding the nutritional significance of foods in the context of a total
daily diet and are in recognition of the fact that the National Academy of
Sciences (NAS) established Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA's)
and Estimated Safe and Adequate Daily Dietary Intakes (ESADDI's) for
vitamin K, selenium, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, and chloride
either in 1980 or 1989.

Frozen dessert year in review

Tea-flavored ice creams and ice cream pizza pies
proliferated in 1995, but the sudden flurry of
competition in these segments ran second to the
developments in another product category, that of
sorbets, where Ice Cream Reporter's top story for the
year is the decision by Haagen-Dazs to proceed with a
national rollout of its sorbet line.  The move by the
world's leading superpremium frozen dessert marketer is
significant on several levels.  Most importantly, a large-
scale advertising and promotion campaign by Haagen-
Dazs created an awareness of sorbets among masses of
consumers who were previously unaware that this type
of product even existed.  But the Haagen-Dazs blitz also
focused attention on the disparity between the marketing
power of the industry's deep-pocketed leaders and the
precarious position of the smaller frozen dessert
companies that struggle along on a shoe-string to
maintain their hold on hard-won market niches.  Some of
those smaller companies felt the pinch as soon as the
Haagen-Dazs rollout began, losing distribution and shelf
space as retailers opted for the big-name brand.  But
other sorbet marketers argued that the public awareness
created for the category by Haagen-Dazs would help all
participants.  Because of its impact on the market,
Haagen-Dazs Sorbet is not only the story of the year for
1995 but also the product of the year.

Encouraged by the entry of Haagen-Dazs, or at least not
discouraged by it, was The Mattus Group, which
introduced a line of sorbets under the Monterey label
(ICR 11/95).  Admitting to being encouraged by the
Haagen-Dazs entry was International Yogurt, which is
now offering its Sorbet...by Yo Cream to its foodservice
customers (ICR 10/95).  Looking for a slightly different
niche is Lafayette Foods, which introduced Frubet, an
ultra-rich sorbet that is being positioned as an upscale
competitor to single-serve Italian ices rather than going
head-to-head with the pint-packed sorbets (ICR 12/95).

Domestic Moves:  The most important event in the
domestic frozen dessert industry, after the Haagen-Dazs
sorbet rollout, was the decision by Brice Foods to end its
traditional franchise practice and switch to a royalty-free
franchise plan for is 200-unit I Can't Believe It's Yogurt
chain (ICR 11/95).  The progress of the new plan, which
will have franchisees purchase their goods from the
franchisor on an as-needed basis, is sure to be watched
closely by other frozen dessert chain operators.

Also making franchise news was TCBY, which announced
in December that it was planning to trnansform all its
company-owned units to franchisees (ICR 12/95).  The
move was part of an overall reorganization of the frozen
yogurt marketer.  Increasing its presence in the
foodservice arena was Dannon, which launched a turn-
key, modular vending concept under the name Yogurt
Cravings (ICR 4/95).

Other major stories on the domestic front included the
return to the black of Ben & Jerry's, after suffering the
first loss in the company's history in the 3rd quarter of
1994 (ICR 12/95); the agreement by the International
Dairy Foods Association and the Dairy and Food
Industries Supply Association to join forces and create a
new International Food and Dairy Show (ICR 2/95); and
the elimination of package size restrictions on frozen
desserts by the National Conference on Weights and
Measures (ICR 8/95).  Also noteworthy was the decision
by Grand Metropolitan to close Haagen-Dazs' long-term
headquarters in Teaneck, NJ and consolidate the
company's operations with those of Pillsbury in
Minneapolis (ICR 10/95).

Product Trends: Following on the flood of coffee-flavored
frozen desserts that hit the market in 1994 came a slew
of tea-flavored products beginning with a line of Iced Tea
Pops produced by H.P. Hood under a licensing agreement
with the highly popular tea marketer Celestial Seasonings
(ICR 3/95).  Also in March was the announcement of a
Lipton Original Iced Tea Bar from Good Humor-Breyers,
with Unilever synergizing two of its most popular brands.
Next up was Frozfruit, which joined the tea party with a
Lemon Iced Tea fruit bar (ICR 4/95).  In another bit of
synergy, Nestle borrowed from its popular tea brand to
create the Nestea Iced Tea Bar (ICR 9/95).

If three makes a trend, then ice cream pizza became a
trend in 1995.  Good Humor-Breyers kicked off the
movement with its Freeza Pizza novelty (ICR 3/95), then
Dairy Queen upped the ante with a full-sized ice cream
pie which it called the DQ Treatzza Pizza (ICR 5/95).
Baskin-Robbins weighed in a few months later with its
Polar Pizza (ICR 9/95), available in both single slices
and whole pie form.

New Products: The Good Humor-Breyers items
mentioned above were part of a massive 50-product
launch by the company this past spring (ICR 3/95) which
also included Romantica, a follow-up to the company's
Viennetta ice cream cake, and Reese's Peanut Butter Ice
Cream Cups, made under a licensing agreement with
Hershey Food Co.

Eskimo Pie made several new product announcements
that involved licensing agreements, beginning with a deal
with Nabisco to create a line of frozen desserts based on
the four most popular cookie brands in the country (ICR
1/95).  The next licensing deal called for Eskimo Pie to
take over the poduction and marketing of the popular
Weight Watchers frozen desserts (ICR 2/95), and a third
saw Eskimo Pie entering into a long-term agreement to
manufacture, distribute, and market Realfruit Sorbets
(ICR 4/95).

In other new product news, Clarke Ice Cream licensed the
A&W root beer brand for a line of novelties (ICR 11/95);
and Healthy Choice added a superpremium low-fat line
under Special Creations label (ICR 3/95).  Also
noteworthy was the launch of Haagen-Dazs Cordials, a
line of liqueur-flavored ice creams (ICR 1/95).

One other new product of significance announced in 1995,
though not due out on the market until 1996, is the
coffee ice cream from Dreyer's and Starbucks (ICR
11/95).  This launch caps the coffee ice cream trend that
began in 1994 by pairing two market leaders in a joint
venture that goes beyond the usual licensing agreement.

Pricing Down:    Two other product introductions of
interest were the Blue Ribbon line of ice cream cakes
from Carvel (ICR 10/95) and the Chiqui i.i. ice creams and
sorbets from Out of a Flower (ICR 11/95).  The two
launches shared a common importance in that they were
both lower-priced versions of products the companies
were already marketing.  In the case of Carvel, the lower-
priced introduction reflected pressure from competing
products; while Out of a Flower was looking to broaden its
distribution to outlets that would not handle its primary
ultra-high-priced line.

Mergers & Acquisitions:    No deal in 1995 came close
to 1994's story-of-the-year, the acquisition by Nestle of
22% of Dreyer's stock.  But among the more interesting
moves in 1995 were the acquisition of Bresler's
Industries by the Canadian marketer Yogen Fruz World-
Wide (ICR 7/95); the acquisition of the rights to the
Colombo frozen yogurt brand by Integrated Brands
(formerly Steve's Homemade) (ICR 9/95); the
management buyout of Nestle Dairy Sytems, renamed
Norse Dairy Systems (ICR 11/95); and Pfizer's sale of its
Food Science Group to the Finnish ingredient company
Cultor, Ltd. (ICR 11/95).

Following upon its acquisition in 1994 by Kohlberg,
Kravis, & Roberts (ICR 9/94), Borden announced that it
was planning to sell its dairies east of the Mississippi in
order to focus on its western dairy operations (ICR 6/95).
The first sale took place shortly thereafter, with a Borden
unit in West Virginia going to United Dairy, Inc. (ICR
7/95).  Later in the year Borden amended its policy
slightly with the sale of one of its key western units, its
Houston frozen dessert plant, to Dreyer's (ICR 12/95).
The acquisition helped strengthen Dreyer's expansion into
the Southwest.

International News:  U.S. frozen dessert marketers
continued to find room for expansion overseas in 1995.
Bresler's Industries reached two licensing agreements in
China (ICR 1/95 and 5/95), and one in Brazil (ICR 6/95);
Baskin-Robbins opened its first shop in Vietnam (ICR
2/95) and expanded its existing operations in Russia (ICR
12/95); TCBY expanded its franchising into India and the
Cayman Islands (ICR 10/95) and Russia (ICR 11/95); and
Brice Foods licensed manufacturing rights for its products
to companies in Europe, Brazil, and Australia to facilitate
supplying of its overseas ICBIY shops (ICR 12/95).

While not contracting in terms of business, Haagen-Dazs
did shrink its overseas operations, closing its Paris
headquarters and consolidating its management into that
of parent Grand Metropolitan (ICR 1/95).  This
anticipated a similar move noted in the Domestic Moves
section above.

People in the News:    Among the people making news in
the frozen dessert industry in 1995, the most prominent
was Bob Holland, who won the job of replacing company
founder Ben Cohen as CEO of Ben & Jerry's following a
much-publicized search and contest (ICR 2/95).  Holland,
who was also named president of the company, is given
much of the credit for getting Ben & Jerry's back on track
in 1995.

Steve Herrell, one of the founding fathers of the
superpremium movement, was also in the news this past
year as he began to expand his latest chain of ice cream
shops (ICR 3/95).  Making news of a less positive nature
was Robert Peltz, former chairman of Chipwich, who was
accused of using almost $700,000 in company funds for
personal expenses (ICR 10/95).

BST:    The battle over the use of the synthetically-
produced growth hormone bovine somatropin (BST)
continued in 1995.  Early on, the pro-BST forces claimed a
number of victories by blocking legislation in states
across the country (ICR 5/95).  In June, Ben & Jerry's, one
of the most prominent foes of BST use, resigned from the
International Ice Cream Association in protest against the
group's pro-BST stance (ICR 6/95).  Later in the year the
pro-BST movement suffered a setback when a Vermont
judge rejected a request for an injunction against the
state's mandatory BST labeling law (ICR 8/95).

Advertising & Promotions:    With reduced-fat, low-fat,
and fat-free frozen desserts claiming a growing share of
the market in 1995, Unilever introduced a new labeling
format for its Good Humor-Breyers light alternative
products, with logos reminding consumers to "Eat
Healthy, Eat Well" and "Eat Better, Eat Well" (ICR 12/95).

 ...And a look at the year ahead

As with many other facets of American life, legislation
now pending in the 104th Congress could have a
significant impact on the frozen dessert industry in 1996.
As explained in an article further on in this issue, there
could be a major increase in frozen dessert prices if
Congress makes changes in current dairy policy.  But, as
the article also explains, it is simply too early to know
whether the changes will be made and, if they are, how
big they will be.

An increase in frozen dessert prices could have the effect
of making it easier in 1996 for the larger companies in
the industry to use discounting and other forms of price
promotion as competitive weapons against smaller
players.  Price competition has been an ongoing factor,
albeit to a relatively small degree, in the frozen dessert
industry.  But it would not be surprising to see more
companies do what Carvel did this past year, i.e.,
introduce a lower-priced line in the face of price
competition from its rivals.

Something that will definitely be lower in 1996 will be
the fat content of more and more frozen dessert products.
Sales of light alternative products were up significantly in
1995 and the trend will continue into 1996.  More and
more marketers will follow the Good Humor-Breyers
example and add logos or other labeling marks that will
make it easier for consumers to identify these products.
The desire for light alternative frozen desserts, coupled
with the rollout of the Haagen-Dazs line of sorbets, our
1995 story of the year, should lead to increased sales for
the sorbet category.

In last year's look ahead we predicted, for the second
time, that Unilever would make a bid for Haagen-Dazs.
With Grand Metropolitan pulling the reins in on Haagen-
Dazs's management this past year, it seems less likely
than ever that the British comglomerate would be willing
to let the superpremium marketer go.  So instead, we'll
focus on the Nestle-Dreyer's connection and suggest that
if the frozen novelties marketer does not make an
outright move to acquire the Oakland-based Dreyer's, it
will definitely seek to improve on its 22% holding.  And if
it doesn't go for Dreyer's, Nestle could make a bid on
Eskimo Pie, perhaps even finding itself in a bidding war
with Unilever for the Virginia-based novelties marketer.

Haagen-Dazs testing cafe concept


Testing of a broader, cafe-type menu concept is
underway in a handful of Haagen-Dazs shops around the
country.  The shops, all franchise operations, have
expanded their offerings beyond the traditional line of
frozen desserts to include such items as sweet baked
goods, sandwiches, and salads.  A Haagen-Dazs
spokesman told Ice Cream Reporter that Rthe company is
interested in seeing how the extended menu will affect
the shops' business.S  He noted that the test is open-
ended, with no specific time-table as to when or whether
additional units will be converted to the cafe concept,
despite some published reports that 25 out of the 250
Haagen-Dazs shops in the U.S. would eventually be
changed over to cafe.

The testing of the cafe concept began last May with a
single shop in Boulder, CO.  A second franchisee
introduced the concept in October at a single unit in
Coconut Grove, FL.  Conversion of a third unit has just
been completed in Tysons Corner, VA.

The new unit has 1,300 square feet of floor space.  The
Haagen-Dazs spokesman explained that the cafe concept
would only be introduced in shops that were between
1,200 and 1,500 sq. ft.  The aim, he noted, was to create a
Rcozy environment,S but that any shop smaller than than
the 1,200 sq. ft. minimum would not be able to
acommodate any tables comfortably or provide enough
floor space for the self-service customer traffic.

The responsibility for the menu expansion rests with the
franchisees who are testing the cafe concept.  The
Haagen-Dazs spokesman indicated that the company
considered the introduction of baked goods as the top
priority with sandwiches, salads, and other foods
secondary.  He reported that the company has not given
the franchisees strict guidelines as to what foods they can
offer, but would draw the line if someone tried to
introduce a line of fried chicken, to use one example.
RThe main parameter,S he explained, Ris whether it
enhances the Haagen-Dazs concept.S

Dairy legislation remains in turmoil


The new year begins with U.S. dairy policy in a state of
flux.  Efforts to reach a decision on whether to retain,
drop, or in some way alter price supports for dairy
products remain unresolved as the larger issue of the
overall budget continues to be worked out.  Despite the
uncertainty, one strong possibility is that the price of
milk will be allowed to go up, sending the price of other
dairy products, including frozen desserts, up with it.

According to the International Dairy Foods Association
(IDFA), a plan proposed by Rep. Steve Gunderson (R-WI),
and supported by the National Milk Producers Federation,
could Rdramatically increase the prices consumers now
pay for milk and other dairy products by billions of
dollars.S  The Gunderson plan is described as a
RcompromiseS because it allows for both an increase and
decrease of government control of dairy at the same time.

The plan follows the current political trend of reducing
government interference in the marketplace by
eliminating price supports for some dairy products.  But
the IDFA points out that what it takes away with one
hand it gives back with interest with the other by locking
in higher minimum price levels to producers for fluid
milk.  These higher prices would be paid by dairy
processors and food manufacturers and then passed along
to consumers.  The government would also be paying the
higher price when purchasing milk and dairy products
for needy citizens.  With budget allotments fixed, this
would result in smaller purchases and fewer people
helped.

An IDFA representative told Ice Cream Reporter that the
Gunderson plan is on the table as a result of President
Clinton having vetoed the budget passed by Congress in
November.  In that budget, dairy policy was to remain
unchanged, a compromise between those conservative
idealogues who wanted to eliminate all government
agricultural supports, including dairy, and
representatives from dairy-producing regions, led by
Jerry Solomon (R-NY), who were defending the interests
of their constituents.  The presidential veto opened the
door to further legislative discussion and the
development of the Gunderson plan.

The IDFA representative noted that passage of the
Gunderson plan was far from being a certainty.  For one
thing, there are strong regional disagreements, chiefly
between producers in the West and the Northeast over
whether the benefits would be distributed equitably.  In
addition, the loss of price supports might lead to the
"dumping" of some U.S. dairy products on world markets
which could be in violation of U.S. trade agreements.
With so many details such as these to be worked out, it is
possible that the budget compromise plan of November,
i.e., leaving current dairy policies in place, will once again
be chosen.

Baskin-Robbins continues convenience store expansion
drive


Baskin-Robbins has announced that it is expanding its
convenience store operations through an agreement with
H.N. Funkhouser, operator of the Virginia-based Handy
Mart chain.  The franchise co-branding agreement, which
also includes Baskin-Robbins' sister company Dunkin'
Donuts, calls for Funkhouser to retro-fit seven of its 14
units to accomodate the frozen dessert and donut
operations.  The Handy Mart units to be converted are
located in Frederick, Warren, and Clarke counties.  The
first unit is expected to be ready by late February, with a
150-square-foot space devoted to the sale of a full line of
Baskin-Robbins ice creams and frozen yogurts, including
pre-packed and hand-packed items, frozen dessert cakes,
and the fountain items typically available in a Baskin-
Robbins shop.  Table space is included, as well.

The Handy Mart deal is the latest in a series reached by
Baskin-Robbins with regional gas station/convenience
store operators over the last two years.  It also continues
the company's ongoing co-franchising effort with Dunkin'
Donuts.  Each of the two companies, owned by the British
conglomerate Allied Domecq, is the largest franchisor
worldwide in its category.  By teaming up, they offer
convenience store operators and other franchisees the
opportunity to offer products that complement each other
seasonally.  In addition, operators can cross-train
employees for both operations.

Funkhouser president Robert Claytor explained that his
company wants to attract a more diverse clientele to the
convenience stores through the addition of the
nationally-known brand name chains.  The Handy Marts
started out as gas stations when they opened in the
1930s, with auto parts sales added in the 1970s, and the
convenience stores in the 1980s.  The inclusion of the
Baskin-Robbins and Dunkin' Donuts operations is in
keeping with a national trend that has seen about 2,000
gas stations across the country add some type of fast food
operation in recent years in order to attract more
travelers to stop at their locations.

Pascobel makes U.S. push

Looking to develop a niche in the U.S. market for frozen
dessert ingredients is the Pascobel Corporation.  An
offshoot of the Montreal-based Pascobel, Inc., the
company offers natural, highly functional milk protein
products that are designed to replace non-fat dry milk
and skim milk powders in a variety of processed dairy
products including ice creams and frozen yogurts.

The products, marketed under the Nollibel and Belcover
labels, have been used for many years by over 300 food
manufacturers in Canada and more than a dozen
European nations.  The long-term acceptance of the
products in Europe is due, in part, to the fact that the
technology for producing the dairy proteins was
developed on the continent over 25 years ago by the
French dairy company Bel Cheese.

Ted Fisch, National Sales Manager for the New Jersey-
based Pascobel, explained that the company had launched
a major effort to acquaint American manufacturers with
its products through an appearance at the 1995
MegaShow in Chicago.  At the show, Pascobel conducted a
blind taste test using a 3% low fat vanilla ice cream.  One
sample was made using skim milk powder while in
another, 50% of the skim milk powder was replaced with
the company's Nollibel 1450 functional milk protein
product.  According to Fisch, over 65% of those who tried
the ice creams preferred the one with the Nollibel.

Fisch noted that the particular variety of Nollibel used in
the taste taste, the least functional in the line, sells for
about half the typical price of skim milk powder.  The
top-of-the line products offer savings closer to 10% off
the typical price of skim milk powder.  Fisch pointed out
that in addition to being less expensive than non-fat dry
milk or skim milk powder, the Pascobel milk protein
products, because of their processing, have greater
consistency and more body and texture than the
competing products.

The company makes a variety of standard products
specifically intended for use in economy ice creams,
premium ice creams, and reduced-fat ice creams and
frozen yogurts.  It also reports that it can customize
products at the manufacturer's request to suit them to
specific applications.

Last Licks


o       Borden has released some additional information on
the sale of its Houston ice cream plant to Dreyer's, which
we reported on in the December ICR.  Under the terms of
the agreement, which became effective December 31,
about 100 hourly workers and 29 salaried employees will
be given severance packages and assistance in finding
new work.  Approximately 35 distribution workers will
be retained by Borden and will continue to be involved in
delivering the company's branded frozen desserts which
will be co-packed by Dreyer's.  Borden also reports that it
will supply the distribution area previously served from
the Houston plant with products manufactured at other
Borden plants in the region.

o       Another item from the December ICR, on the
expansion of Baskin-Robbins operations in Russia,
requires amending.  We reported that the company's
production facility in Moscow would not be open until the
spring.  The day after we went to press, we were
informed that the plant had become operational on
December 11th.  In addition, the facility will serve the
company's Russian stores only, although deliveries to
other countries may follow in the future.  ICR had
indicated that the plant would begin serving East
European countries immediately.

o       In another follow-up on our December issue, the
December 4 issue of Crain's Cleveland Business reports
that Pierre's French Ice Cream has followed its Lysteria-
related product recall of late October/early November
with a major coupon campaign intended as a Rthank youS
to loyal customers.  The $2-off coupons appeared on
November 29th in The Plain Dealer, The Beacon-Journal,
and some 20 newspapers throughout northern Ohio and
western Pennsylvania.

o       Back in October, ICR reported that Denver-based
Meadow Gold Dairies was scoring big with its Colorado
Rockies Ice Cream, named for the city's baseball team.
Now it has followed up with another sports-related line,
this time named for the local National Hockey League
team, the Colorado Avalanche.  Individual flavors feature
such rink-related names as Slap Shot Vanilla, Hat Trick
Sundae, and Chocolate Power Play.

o       The December 8 Financial Times reported that
Nestle Philippines would be taking a greater role in the
operations of Magnolia Nestle, its ice cream company joint
venture with San Miguel, the largest food company in the
Philippines.  Magnolia holds a 56% share of the ice cream
market in the Philippines, but that represents a
significant loss from previous years.

o       Catching up on some other overseas news, the
September 12 edition of Euromarketing reported that
Unilever subsidiary GB-Glace Sweden is withdrawing
from the Norwegian market after failing in its efforts to
take share away from frozen dessert market leader Norsk
Iskrem.  GB-Glace has accumulated about $8 million in
losses since entering that market in 1991.  Norsk Iskrem
holds a 49% share of the Norwegian market, with Hennig
Olsen second at 34%, and Drammens Is third with a 13%
share.

o       And catching up on some domestic news from the
same month, the September 22 edition of the
Birmingham News reported that newly-arrived Blue Bell
Ice Cream had taken the lead in that city's ice cream
sales, surpassing Barber Dairies, a hometown favorite for
75 years, by garnering a 32.3% market share.  Texas-
based Blue Bell had expanded distribution into the
Birmingham market only a few months earlier, as
reported in the February 1995 ICR.

o       Jerseymaid Dairies announced on December 14 that
it was recalling half-gallon containers of the Select brand
Light Rocky Road Ice Cream it co-packed for the Safeway
supermarket chain following the discovery of Listeria
contamination during a sampling of the product.  The
containers had been distributed from the company's base
in City of Commerce, CA to stores in northern California,
Arizona, Nevada, and Hawaii.

o       Happier news on that same date of December 14
cmme from TCBY which  announced that its board of
directors had declared a $0.05 per share dividend
payable on January 15 to all shareholders of record as of
December 29.

o       The Sealright Company has announced third quarter
results for the period ending September 30, 1995 with
sales of $76.2 million, down 4.5% from the same period in
1994.  Net income was $1.05 million, down almost 77%,
with income per share down from $0.41 to $0.09.  Charles
F. Marcy, Sealright's President and CEO, describing the
results as Runacceptable,S explained that they reflected
below-plan sales of the company's frozen dessert
packaging business to regional customers who were
losing market share to aggressive national competitors.

o       The International Dairy Foods Association will be
holding its Ice Cream Technology Conference on February
21-23 at the Red Lion's La Posada Resort in Scottsdale,
AZ.  Among the topics to be discussed are frozen dessert
standards and composition, production technologies,
ingredient selection, product safety, and labeling.  For
more information call the IDFA at 202-737-4332 or fax
to 202-331-7820.

DIETARY GUIDELINES OKAY MODERATE DRINKING;
CSPI HEAD CALLS THEM APPROPRIATE


     Last week's release of the 1995 "Dietary Guidelines for
Americans" marked the end of a change in official attitude toward
bev/al.  Where a decade ago, bev/al was the target of a
neo-Prohibitionist crusade, now moderate consumption is viewed as
appropriate.
     Indeed, the attitude in Washington had so changed that
Michael Jacobson, executive director of Center for Science in the Public
Interest and a long-time opponent of the bev/al industry, was overheard
telling a Knight-Ridder reporter:  "I think it's okay to mention alcohol.
The Guidelines clearly don't encourage excessive drinking.  You'd have
to be inebriated to think the Guidelines encourage excessive drinking."
     In a major departure from the 1990 Guidelines, the new version
eliminates previous commentary that alcohol consumption "has no net
health benefit" and "is not recommended."
     They note "current evidence' that suggests moderate drinking is
"associated with a lower risk for coronary heart disease."  And in its
advice section, the Guidelines state:  "If you drink alcoholic beverages,
do so in moderation, with meals, and when consumption does not put
you or others at risk."
     The significance of the change was emphasized by Dr. Philip
Lee, assistant secretary of health:  "In my personal view, wine with meals
is beneficial.  There was a significant bias in the past against drinking.
To move from anti-alcohol to health benefits is a big change."
     Donna Shalala, secretary of health and human services, added
that the guidelines acknowledge "what most of us have known all along:
food is not just fuel, it is one of life's greatest pleasures."
     Needless to say, publication of the Guidelines brought joy to
John DeLuca, president, Wine Institute, who seven years ago developed
a strategy of dealing with anti-alcohol sentiment by researching
scientific information showing health benefits of moderate consumption.
     He praised the Guidelines for more clearly distinguishing
moderation from abuse, noting harmful effects when alcohol is
"consumed in excess" and listing dangers associated with only "higher
levels of alcohol intake," "too much alcohol" and "heavy drinkers."
     Meanwhile, Fred A. Meister, president/ceo, Distilled Spirits
Council of the U.S., praised the Federal Government for "recognizing
that distilled spirits plays a role in the lifestyle and diet of adult
Americans."
     He said removal of language that drinking has "no net health
benefit" and inclusion of the potential health benefit of moderate
drinking "of distilled spirits or other bev/al is an important
acknowledgment of the growing body of scientific studies on the
subject."

British Study Okays Moderate Drinking, Sets Higher Limits than U.S.


     Less than three weeks before the new Dietary Guidelines were
released in Washington, the British Government's Department of
Health reported that "it is now established that the main specific
pathology which benefits from alcohol consumption is coronary heart
disease."  There is, it said, "very likely" a protective effect from alcohol.
     The report offers daily, rather than the previous weekly,
benchmarks for safe drinking.  The benchmarks are higher than the
U.S. version:  eight to 12 ounces of wine for women 12 to 16 ounces a
day for men.

Budget Impasse Threatens CSAP,
But May Also Imperil Industry Programs


     Industry executives are hardly shedding tears that the Center
for Substance Abuse Prevention has been virtually shut down by the
current budget impasse.  Most executives view CSAP, a unit of the
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration, as a hotbed of
biased anti-alcohol activity, an agency many view as playing fast and
loose with the facts and the law.
     But we talked last week with a highly respected political
operative who -- while he certainly was shedding no tears for SAMHA
-- warned that the budget battle, which has nearly closed the
Department of Health and Human Services, could hurt the industry too.
     He fears the result will be that every nook and cranny of the
federal budget will be examined, imperiling such things as the Market
Promotion Program, studies on the health effects of alcohol, research
for viticulture, proposed changes in the Internal Revenue Code dealing
with phylloxera and the industry's quest to roll back that big tax increase
five years ago.
     While the House Republicans are widely believed not to want a
budget deal -- unless they get everything they want -- the simple fact is
that a lot of rank and file House Democrats don't want a deal, either.
They believe the current standoff will bolster their changes of regaining
control of the House.

Vermont Adopts a Liquor "Fee"


     Vermont Liquor Control Board imposed a 20 cents a bottle
"fee" on four sizes of distilled spirits, effective Jan. 1.
     The increase, levied without industry or consumer consultation,
applies to 200 ml,  375 ml, 750 ml and 1 liter bottles.
     Fred A. Meister, president/ceo, Distilled Spirits COuncil of the
U.S., said he was "extremely disappointed and puzzled by this ill-advised
and discriminatory price increase on distilled spirits.  This decision was
made without the input of the people who will be most affected --
Vermont consumers and the producers and suppliers of distilled spirits.
We urge them to reconsider."
     State and local taxes paid on a typical purchase in Vermont are
111% greater than in neighboring New Hampshire.
     Monita Fontaine, DISCUS state government relations director,
wondered why, if the Board's goal was to raise additional revenue,
should it focus on distilled spirits, which represent less than 29% of
alcohol purchased in the state.  The revenue burden on distilled spirits
in Vermont is 108% more than the burden per alcohol gallon on beer
and 65% greater than the burden on table wines, Fontaine said.

Pataki Vetos Reciprocal Shipping Bill
In New York, Questioning Benefits


     A bill to permit out-of-state wineries, individuals or licensees to
ship wine for personal use into New York State was vetoed by Gov.
George Pataki.
     Pataki noted that supporters had said the bill would encourage
the sale of wine from New York wineries, benefit the tourism industry,
and enhance New York's reputation as a wine-producing state.
     "I am not convinced the bill would, in fact, benefit New York's
reputation as a wine-producing state.  And I am extremely concerned
about the potentially negative impact this bill, if enacted, would have on
existing, licensed New York State businesses relying on wine sales, as
well as its impact on New York wineries and jobs."
     Indeed, Pataki said he thought the result would be increased
mail-order sales of California wines, leading to lower sales for New
York liquor stores and distributors, a shrunken market share for New
York wineries within the state.
     New York tax authorities estimated the bill would result in the
loss of $1 per case in excise tax revenue, $10 per case in sales tax
revenue and local governments would also lose $10 a case in sales tax
revenue.

BEVERAGES ARE FOOD CATEGORY PURCHASED
MOST OFTEN BY MASS RETAIL SHOPPERS, SURVEY SHOWS

     Carbonated soft drinks and juice are the two food items
consumers are most likely to buy at mass retail stores, according to a
new study published by the International Mass Retail Association
(IMRA). The study was prepared by the Gallup Organization for
IMRA's membership, which includes discount department stores,
warehouse/club stores, specialty discounters, deep discount drug stores,
off-price stores, variety stores, and dollar stores, among others.

     The study, entitled Consumer Shopping Behavior on Food
Merchandise and In-store Food Services, includes the responses of 1,011
adults aged 18 years and older, who were surveyed by telephone in
September 1995. Among the findings of the study were the following
highlights.

Profile of Survey Participants

     * Nearly one-fourth of all respondents (23 percent) said they
visited mass retail or discount stores more than once a week in a typical
month. Thirty-one percent said they visited such stores twice (16
percent) or three times (15 percent) a month. Only seven percent of all
respondents said they never visited mass retail stores.

     * Females  were significantly  more likely to be the primary
shopper  in  the  family  for  clothing  and  household goods (92
percent), and food (89 percent), than  were males (70 percent).

     * Accordingly, females were more frequent visitors to mass
retail stores than males, with 19 percent of the female respondents
saying they went to mass retail stores at least once a week in a typical
month, compared to only 12 percent of males who visited such stores
that often.

     * Older respondents appeared slightly less likely to visit mass
retail stores than were the younger respondents. Only six percent of
those aged 18 to 34 years said they never visited mass retail stores, while
twice as many of those 55 years or older (13 percent) never visited these
stores.

     * Respondents were most likely (73 percent) to express a
preference for shopping at one store that carried a complete selection
of groceries as well as general merchandise.

     * Slightly more than one in six (17 percent) of all respondents
said that they always make some type of packaged food purchase during
a visit to a mass retail store. Another 27 percent said that they
frequently make such purchases. About three in ten respondents said
they rarely (20 percent) or never (nine percent) purchase packaged
foods at mass retail stores.

     * Older respondents appear less likely to purchase packaged
food at mass retail stores than do younger respondents. One third (32
percent) of those respondents age 55 and older said they rarely (21
percent) or never (nine percent) purchased packaged foods at mass
retail stores, compared to only 25 percent of those respondents aged 18
to 34 who rarely (18 percent) or never (seven percent) purchased such
food items.

     There were no significant regional or income differences in
terms of purchase frequency for packaged foods.

Soda and Juice Purchases

     The survey participants were asked how often they bought
these particular food items at mass retail stores: soda; juice; canned or
dried foods; snack foods; cookies; candy; alcoholic beverages; and baby
food.

     * Of all the food products that were specified in the survey,
soda and juice were the two products most often reported to be "very
likely" to be purchased at mass retail stores. Each product was rated
by 39 percent of the respondents to be a product they would be "very
likely" to buy at a mass retail store.

     * Respondents aged 55 years and older (32 percent) and those
respondents in the northeast (33 percent) showed a slightly lower
tendency to purchase soda.

     * Thirty-four percent of the respondents said they would be
somewhat likely to purchase soda; 26 percent said they were not at all
likely to purchase soda. One percent responded "don't know."

     * Respondents aged 35 to 54 years (36 percent) said they were
slightly less likely to purchase juice at a mass retail store, compared to
those respondents aged 55 years and older (42 percent). Respondents in
the south central region of the U.S. (43 percent), and those with
incomes of less than $20,000, were slightly more likely to purchase
juice.

The Decision To Purchase

     When asked to indicate their typical weekly packaged food
expenditures at mass retail stores, respondents indicated their average
expenditure was slightly less than $32 a week. Forty-four percent of all
respondents, however, indicated that they spend $20 or less in a typical
week for packaged food purchases.

     Respondents in the western region of the U.S. had the largest
weekly expenditures for packaged foods, while single respondents, those
55 years and older, and those in the north central region, spent the least
on average.

     Respondents were asked to characterize their food purchases
as either "planned" or "impulse" purchases. In the categories of both
packaged and prepared food, respondents were more likely to make the
decision to purchase after they were at the stores. Respondents were,
however, significantly more likely to view prepared food purchases as
impulse purchases, as opposed to packaged food purchases.

     Respondents were asked to rate various factors they consider
when deciding to buy food at mass retail stores. Quality was rated the
most important factor by 71 percent of respondents; price was second
most important, with 61 percent of participants citing it as a factor.
Selection of brands was third, at 38 percent; followed by
coupons/special promotions, 34 percent; advertised specials, 33 percent;
availability of specialty foods, 31 percent; and availability of store
brands, 21 percent.

     Females (77 percent) and respondents in the northeast (78
percent) were most likely to rate quality as very important, while males
(64 percent) and those in the west (66 percent) and north central (67
percent) regions were least likely to rate quality as very important.

     Price  was  most important to  18-to-34  year-olds (67 percent),
those with household incomes of less than $20,000 a year (67 percent),
and females (65 percent). Respondents aged 55 years  or  older (52
percent),  those  with  household  incomes of $60,000 or greater (52
percent), and males (56 percent), were least likely to rate the price of an
item as extremely important.

Mass Retail Association (IMRA), phone (703) 841-2300.

MORE COMBINATION GROCERY/MERCHANDISE
STORES OPENED IN 1994, FMI STUDY SHOWS

     Although conventional supermarkets continue to account for
the single largest percentage of food stores in operation, the percentage
of combination grocery/merchandise stores rose significantly in 1994,
according to a new study by the Food Marketing Institute (FMI). The
study, entitled 1995 Facts About Store Development, revealed that in
1994, for the first time, conventional stores accounted for less than half
(48.9 percent) of all stores. The number of combination stores, by
contrast, rose seven percentage points to a 21 percent share.
Superstores continued to represent about 25 percent of food stores,
while warehouse and limited assortment stores accounted for less than
five percent.

     Supermarket construction grew at a modest rate during 1994,
when 3.3 percent of stores were new and 3.4 percent were closed --
figures similar to the previous year. According to FMI, this trend
indicates that new stores continue to replace older ones, rather than
gaining a greater share of the U.S. supermarket mix.

     The median size of new stores was 48,200 square feet in 1994,
up from 38,000 square feet the previous year. This increase was
attributed to the growth in construction of larger-sized combination
stores and superstores. More than six percent of stores underwent
major remodeling during the survey period, with competition cited by
three in 10 survey respondents as the primary reason, and half reporting
that the store needed it. Of the stores that were remodeled, four in 10
were also expanded, by an average of about 5,300 square feet.

     To order a copy of 1995 Facts About Store Development,

COCA-COLA SOLD 3.8 BILLION UNIT CASES
IN U.S. LAST YEAR; FOUNTAIN SALES UP, TOO

     Coca-Cola Co. has reported that 1995 was a record-setting year
for the company, which sold 3.8 billion unit cases of soft drinks and
non-carbonated beverages in the U.S. In addition, for the first time,
Coca-Cola Co. sold one billion unit cases more than any other soft drink
competitor in the country.

     Jack L. Stahl, president of Coca-Cola USA, commented that
"the combined strength of our brand portfolio, our contour packaging
and our bottler system has allowed us to grow twice as fast as the
industry in 1995. We intend to build upon that momentum in 1996."

     Fountain sales contributed significantly to the company's robust
results. Coca-Cola Fountain added more than 500 new chain accounts
and 8,000 net new outlets last year, including the conversion of
competitive outlets such as Steak 'N Shake restaurants and Harrah's
Entertainment, as well as the addition of new outlets owned by existing
customers. According to the company, Coca-Cola products are currently
available in 92 of the top 100 fountain accounts in the U.S., outselling
the leading competitor by a 3-to-1 margin in the channel.

     The company also entered a unique agreement with
Blockbuster Entertainment in 1995, which places Coca-Cola products in
5,000 retail outlets worldwide.

     "We are extremely pleased with our 1995 success, even though
we experienced some disappointments -- losing some volume with
customers like Sbarro's, with some Jack-in-the-Box franchisees or with
Circle K, for example," noted Stahl. "We enter 1996 determined to
capture even more of the industry growth and to do all we can to help
our customers profitably build their soft drink businesses."

     Coca-Cola products are also widely available at recreational
facilities across the U.S., including 90 percent of sports venues, theme
parks and amphitheaters, and 85 percent of movie theaters and zoos.
Entertainment accounts that were added or renewed in 1995 included
the Sony movie theater chain, the Houston and Cincinnati zoos, and the
Fremont Street Experience in Las Vegas, Nev.

MAINE BOTTLE BILL WOULD IMPOSE FEES,
PAPERWORK, ON BEVERAGE MAKERS

     The International Bottled Water Association (IBWA) has
reported that the Maine Bottle Bill Task Force has proposed legislation
that would require all manufacturers to pay an annual $500 registration
fee to the Maine Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural
Resources if their products are packaged in beverage containers subject
to the state's deposit system. The purpose of the bill is to reduce
fraudulent redemption of containers originating in neighboring states.
The annual fee would be used to pay for the department's enforcement
activities related to the administration of the bottle bill.

     But the proposal goes beyond a mere fee -- it would also create
a new paperwork burden. The bill would require manufacturers to
report:

     (1) each product brand name that requires a deposit;

     (2) the name and address of any distributor the manufacturer
uses to sell the products;

     (3) the number of "filled" beverage containers sold to
distributors in Maine;

     (4) the names and addresses of the manufacturer's third-party
"pick-up agents," which is defined as a person who has assumed the
container pick-up responsibility imposed on the deposit initiator; and

     (5) the number of beverage containers redeemed by the
manufacturer.

     To enforce these requirements, the bill provides the agriculture
department with broad powers to refuse to issue, revoke or suspend the
registration of a manufacturer, which would limit its ability to sell
products in Maine. Any manufacturer failing to register would be fined
$100 per day.

1996 BEVERAGE INDUSTRY LEGISLATIVE AGENDA WILL BE SHAPED BY ELECTIONS

As the government affairs specialists for the soft drink and alcoholic
beverage industries shape up their legislative priorities for 1996, the
dominant factor will be the upcoming congressional and presidential
elections.

Neither Congress nor the White House will take any action without
considering its November impact, and this is a recipe for continued and
deepening gridlock with even less accomplished legislatively than in
1995.

Nevertheless, the Washington associations representing the beverage
industry, and industry members active in lobbying, will seek
opportunities to advance their causes whenever possible.

The soft drink industry's highest priority goal is to amend farm
legislation to eliminate or greatly modify the current sugar program.
Opportunities to achieve this goal may be presented in this session of
Congress. (See following story)

Other soft drink industry priorities include: reform of the Delaney
clause, streamlining FDA's food additive approval process and achieving
national uniformity in food labeling. NSDA is working with a food
industry coalition on these objectives.

Delaney clause nullification is contained in the dormant balanced budget
legislation, and its chances for passage grow dimmer. Several bills have
been introduced to improve FDA's food additive approval process--but
none meeting the food industry coalition's requirements.

Action on new legislation to reauthorize the Clean Water Act is possible
in this session, and NSDA is monitoring how it could impact on
bottlers' waste water discharge practices and on control of storm water
runoff.

How reauthorization of the Safe Drinking Water Act could affect the
quality of water available to soft drink plants and its cost is also being
studied should this legislation resurface this year.

Legislation to replace the dollar bill with a dollar coin suffered a setback
at the end of the previous session, but the effort continues despite its
unlikely chances for passage in an election year.

Lesser priorities are given to legislative relief in several tax areas
including estate taxes, Subchapter S Corporate taxes and retaining the
Puerto Rican manufacturing tax credit. National forced deposit
legislation did not make the soft drink legislative priority list for the first
time in decades.

The alcoholic beverage industry had a quiet legislative year mostly spent
monitoring developments. Enough industry support could be generated
in Congress to block adverse legislation on taxes and limitations on
advertising, but not enough was available to generate new initiatives.
The same can be expected in 1996.

With election considerations placing a continuing damper on the
progress of legislation in this Congress, the government affairs
specialists may soon turn their attention to the election campaigns and
their candidates.

This year's elections could be the most decisive for American business
in recent memory. It is a rare opportunity for industry-oriented leaders
to control both houses of Congress and the White House.

If the opportunity is muffed and the pendulum begins to swing back, the
gridlock of 1995-96 may be as close as business will come for a long
time to enacting much needed government reforms.

Because of the importance of the 1996 elections, WBI will expand its
coverage during the year beyond beverage industry issues to issues of
importance to industry in general, particularly as they pertain to the
elections.

SUGAR PROGRAM OPPONENTS AWAIT HOUSE ACTION ON FARM BILL

Rep. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), House Agriculture Committee Chairman, has
scheduled a meeting on Tuesday to consider farm legislation for House
floor action on Wednesday. The coalition to kill or amend the sugar
program is ready to have its amendment offered if the opportunity
arises. (See WBI Nov. 10, 1995)

Immediate legislation is needed because federal programs for corn,
wheat and other grains have expired, and farmers have to know what
program they are operating under before they can begin planting.

Rep. Roberts introduced a comprehensive farm bill on January 9,
incorporating "Freedom to Farm" provisions of the farm bill now stalled
in the balanced budget stalemate, but he has no immediate plans to bring
it to the floor because it has many opponents who would offer a raft of
amendments to it.
With Congress scheduled to recess on Thursday, it is unlikely that any
type of farm legislation could be passed next week. Without legislation,
many crop programs will revert to statutes written in 1938 and 1949
which provided high price supports but restricted plantings. This is
unacceptable to the Administration.

Therefore, farm legislation is likely to be considered when Congress
begins work again in March. If Roberts introduces his full-featured
seven-year farm bill, the coalition against the sugar program again will
be poised to act.

If, however, he introduces a bill only to solve the grain growers'
problems for the next one or two years, he may convince the leadership
to restrict amendments in the interest of passing "emergency" legislation.

SUGAR IMPORT QUOTA IS INCREASED 28%, BUT LITTLE AFFECT ON PRICES
SEEN

Heeding requests from the Sweetener Users Association, USDA has
increased the import quota for raw sugar by 400,000 tons to prevent a
shortage and higher prices, but sugar farmers charged there was no need
for the increase.
U.S. cane sugar refiners, who had complained that the U.S. sugar
program was driving companies out of business, will be helped by the
increase. They predict the quota will have to be increased again later in
the year after USDA monitors sugar supplies and import requirements.

While the current increase is not expected to lower sweetener prices to
industrial sugar users, a further increase in the quota could produce price
reductions.

FDA REQUIRES FAT SUBSTITUTE APPROVED FOR SNACK FOODS TO CARRY
WARNING

Diet soft drinks soon will not be the only snack foods displaying health
warnings. Olestra, a substitute for conventional fats developed by
Procter & Gamble and approved for snack food use this week by FDA,
will carry the warning:

"This Product Contains Olestra. Olestra may cause abdominal cramping
and loose stools. Olestra inhibits the absorption of some vitamins and
other nutrients. Vitamins A, D, E, and K have been added."

P&G will use the fat substitute in its Pringle potato chips expected to be
on the market within nine months, and license it under the name
"Olean" to other companies including PepsiCo's Frito-Lay which plans
a test marketing.

Michael Jacobsen, executive director of the Center for Science in the
Public Interest predicted that olestra "in the short run will certainly
cause diarrhea and gastrointestinal problems, and in the long run almost
certainly will cause cancer, heart disease and blindness for many who
consume it regularly."

The Center can be expected to wage a continuing campaign to reverse
FDA's approval, which came after three decades of development and
testing by P&G at a cost estimated to be more than $200 million.

FDA took the unusual step of requiring the company to conduct more
tests of the product's long-term safety. The agency will review its
approval within 30 months, and could revoke it "if there is no longer a
reasonable certainty of no harm" from olestra's use.

CLINTON'S STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH GIVES REPUBLICANS WAKE-UP
CALL

If anyone ever bearded the lion in its own den, President Clinton did it
to the Republicans in his State of the Union Message delivered Tuesday
in the House of Representatives, den of the "in-your-face" freshmen.

The President began the speech sounding like an anti-big-government
Republican, ended the speech giving something to everybody like a
Democrat, nailed the Republicans for closing down the government, and
won bi-partisan applause for the job his wife is doing as First Lady.

Forced by Republican budget constraints to avoid promises of significant
new government programs, a staple for Democratic messages, he
advocated only the popularly-rated issues on which Democrats of all
stripes agree.

While the President's speech seemed to unite Democrats, Republican
Candidate Robert Dole's businesslike response to the President drew a
poor second in the ratings, raised again the "charisma" issue, and gave
his Republican presidential opponents ammunition to split the party.

ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES WIN PLACE IN UNITED STATES' DIETARY
GUIDELINES

After considering a barrage of scientific data on alcohol consumption
which suggests that moderate drinking is associated with a lower risk of
coronary heart disease, the drafters of the 1995 Dietary Guidelines for
Americans for the first time included a favorable reference to alcoholic
beverages. (See WBI Sept. 8, 1995)

The Guidelines advise moderate alcohol consumption--defined as no
more than one drink a day for women and two a day for men. A drink
is defined as 1.5 ounces of hard liquor, 12 ounces of beer and 5 ounces
of wine. The 1990 Guidelines concluded that alcohol consumption has
no net benefit and "is not recommended."

the throes of consolidation--are convinced that Fay's (FAY), the nation's
13th-largest drugstore chain, is ripe for picking. The shares have dropped
to 7, down from 9 3/8 in late April, partly because of investors'
disappointment that a rumored takeover has not yet materialized. And a
flurry of yearend tax-loss sell-offs may be adding to the downward
pressure.
But the focus, insists one big investor, should be on what's happening to
all drug chains. ``A shakeout in the industry is under way,'' notes analyst
Maurice Levenson of Value Line. This is being fostered, he explains, by the
emergence of managed-health-care plans and stiff competition from giant
discounters such as Wal-Mart Stores and Target Stores. Analysts note the
industry could also shed a lot of duplication and costs by buyouts of
weaker companies. A recent example is Rite Aid's agreement to acquire Revco
for $1.8 billion.
   Fay's--with its sales sluggish, its earnings down, and the stock on the
ropes--is regarded as one of the industry's weak sisters. ``It's similar to
the Revco situation. The likes of such possible suitors as Walgreen's could
swallow it up just like that,'' says investment manager Mike Kicera of MRK
Capital Management.
   Kicera figures that Fay's shares are worth 12 to 15 in a buyout--based
on what Rite Aid agreed to pay for Revco. With 276 outlets in New
Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont, Fay's is streamlining its
operations by getting rid of noncore businesses. It sold off Wheels
Discount Auto Supply Div. to Sears Roebuck's Western Auto Supply for $37
million. Management is also expected to unload the 30 Paper Cutter
discount-office-supply stores.
   ``Without Wheels and Paper Cutter, Fay's would be a much more attractive
takeover target,'' says one money manager accumulating shares.
   Providing added inducement for Fay's to sell: Management and directors
own about 31% of the stock--including the holdings of the family of
Chairman Henry Panasci Jr. Fay's didn't return calls.

THE WAY THE OLD RUBBER CRUMBLES

By:
BY GENE G. MARCIAL

Not everything in today's hot IPO market is Internet-related. One issue
that some pros like--GreenMan Technologies (GMTI)--is nowhere near
cyberspace: It's in tire recycling. GreenMan went public on Oct. 3 at 5 a
share. On opening day, the stock jumped to more than 8 and stayed there for
eight trading days--until profit-taking spoiled some of the fun. But some
money managers still think it's worth loading up on GreenMan--now at 6.
   What's the allure of tire recycling? GreenMan uses a patented cryogenic
(low-temperature) technology to make used tires brittle, thus yielding
crumb-rubber granules. These granules are a low-cost source of rubber and
plastic waste, according to one money manager who has a sizable stake.
GreenMan's chief product is a proprietary thermoplastic rubber material
that uses crumbs from discarded tires. GreenMan uses it to produce water
filters, pumps, stereo components, and computer accessories.
   On Dec. 14, Browning-Ferris Industries, a major player in solid-waste
collection and recycling, signed an exclusive contract for GreenMan to
build and operate a crumb-rubber processing facility on Browning's site in
Jackson, Ga. It will convert a minimum of 32,000 tons a year of shredded
tires into high quality crumb rubber. Browning-Ferris may buy an equity
stake in GreenMan, speculates one analyst.
   Revenues for the year ending May 31, 1996, are expected to be $7 million
to $10 million, in part from a $2 million contract with Coca-Cola--for
GreenMan to make display racks of recycled rubber. One analyst sees
GreenMan going into the black in 1996.

CHINA TIRE MAY BE UNDULY DEFLATED

By:
BY GENE G. MARCIAL

On the Big Board, China Tire Holdings (TIR) behaves as if it were a
retread. In early summer, shares of this major Chinese tiremaker were
around 12. They're now at 6, and even Morgan Stanley downgraded its rating
in November to ``neutral'' from an earlier ``buy.'' That's quite a blow:
Morgan Stanley was one of China Tire's major underwriters when it went
public--in July, 1993, at 17 a share. And it owns 5.7% of the stock.
Constantly shifting U.S.-China relations are part of the Street's aversion
to the stock. And there has been concern about China Tire's earnings
predictability.
   But not everyone is down on the stock. Investment manager Bill Harnisch
has been buying since the stock hit 8 in September--and bought even more
when it dropped to 6. How come?
   ``For a company with an estimated book value of more than $15 a share,
the stock is very cheap,'' says Harnisch, president of Forstmann-Leff, a
New York investment firm managing about $3 billion. And in spite of the
poor performance of most other Chinese tire biggies--caused in part by a
drop in car sales--China Tire's revenues in most of 1995 jumped by more
than 33%, and its earnings grew by 10%, he notes. Harnisch estimates 1995
earnings at 50 cents a share. For 1996, he foresees earnings of 75 cents.
   And then, there is the ``bonanza that we expect China Tire could win
from its lawsuit filed against Goodyear in the U.S.,'' says Harnisch. China
Tire claims that Goodyear interfered with its contract to buy a radial-tire
factory in China owned by Dalian General Rubber Factory: Goodyear bought
the factory instead. Some analysts believe Goodyear Tire & Rubber faces a
$3 billion penalty if it loses the legal fight.

A TOUGH YEAR TO FOLLOW

By:
Edited by Mark N. Vamos

Executives at America's largest public companies see the economy cooling a
bit in the coming year. They're a tad less optimistic than they were this
time last year. Fewer expect growth in gross domestic product to pick up in
1996, and the number anticipating rising unemployment has doubled. But
managers cheer the Fed: Their inflation fears have all but vanished, and
few worry about rising interest rates. A remarkable 91% give Fed Chairman
Alan Greenspan high marks, compared with the 26% who applaud Clinton's
handling of the economy.

Survey of 401 senior executives drawn from the BUSINESS WEEK 1000.
Interviews were conducted for BUSINESS WEEK Nov. 30-Dec. 15, 1995 by Louis
Harris & Associates Inc. Previous surveys cited were of 400 senior
executives on Nov. 28-Dec. 5, 1994 and of 402 senior executives Dec. 10-20,
1993.

CRUISE CONTROL?
Car sales should remain strong, though high sticker prices are worrisome

By:
By Kathleen Kerwin and Keith Naughton in Detroit


Peter Dirisamer may not drive home a new car in 1996. Dirisamer, 37, an
Elmhurst (Ill.) technical writer, wants to replace his family's 1988
Plymouth Horizon subcompact. But with average new-car prices pushing
$20,000, he's not finding much he can afford. ``Detroit expects me to pay
$20,000 for the average four-door sedan?'' he sniffs. ``I don't think so.''
Instead, he may settle for a used car.
   Consumers such as Dirisamer are the reason Detroit is cautious about its
prospects for the new year. ``Price is the issue with customers,'' says
Lehman Brothers Inc. analyst Joseph Phillippi. And with a flood of two- and
three-year-old cars and trucks coming back on the market as their leases
expire--2.3 million in 1996 alone, according to Art Spinella of CNW
Marketing/Research in Bandon, Ore.--consumers are finding plenty of
alternatives to pricey new wheels.
   So Detroit is prepared to idle along at about the same rate as the
overall economy. Auto executives are looking for only a modest improvement
of less than 2% over 1995's U.S. sales of 14.8 million cars and light
trucks. Says General Motors Corp. Chairman John F. Smith Jr.: ``1996 looks
like a good year, not spectacular.''
   Perhaps, too, Detroit is a bit cautious about predicting rosy sales. A
year ago, its optimism had reached fever pitch. But by mid-January,
consumers began to cool on auto buying as they felt the cumulative effect
of interest-rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Sales revived by fits and
starts through 1995, ending about 2.6% behind 1994's pace.
GOOD AS IT GETS? Auto sales should be helped in 1996 by low interest rates,
which make auto loans and lease terms more attractive. A continuing
appetite for American-made trucks, including minivans and sport utilities,
also is in Detroit's favor. And the Big Three are introducing a host of new
models, notably Ford's Escort small car and F-series pickup, GM's new
midsize cars and minivans, and Chrysler's Dodge Dakota pickup.
   Still, other worries loom. PaineWebber Inc. analyst Michael Ward frets
about unsold cars and trucks on dealer lots, which reached a 75-day average
supply late in 1995, 14% above year-ago levels. Ward predicts little change
in sales for 1996: ``This is as good as it's going to get for Detroit.''
   While most on Wall Street predict slightly stronger sales ahead, they
don't expect them to flow straight to the bottom line. Customers are
demanding cash rebates and sweet lease terms on all but the hottest-selling
trucks. Flemington (N.J.) car dealer Steve Kalafer, who owns 23
dealerships, says the only thing selling these days is bargains: ``In a
world full of wonderful products, the consumer is buying the deal.''
   That squeezes auto makers' profit margins. ``The industry's margins are
a disaster for an expansion,'' says Paul Ballew, chief economist for J.D.
Power & Associates Inc. Adding to the uncertainty, Detroit's contracts with
the United Auto Workers expire in September. A spirited debate is expected
about the auto makers' shifting jobs to outside suppliers (box). And
Japanese competitors are hard on Detroit's bumper: introducing snazzy new
vehicles while keeping price increases small.
   Ford's costs of launching its many new vehicles will continue to drag
down profits during the first half of the year, company executives say.
Stockholders remain anxious about the company's strategy of loading on
features to lure import-loving baby boomers at a time when consumers shun
higher sticker prices. Ford also will expand its ambitious global
reorganization--dubbed Ford 2000--by folding South America, New Zealand,
Australia, and Taiwan into its combined North American and European
operations in 1996. J.P. Morgan & Co. analyst David Bradley expects Ford to
earn $3.6 billion, unchanged from 1995, on sales of $123 billion.
   General Motors Corp., which sat out most of 1995 without new models,
launches a series of important vehicles this year. After bungling several
car launches in recent years, it has been working on debugging its
manufacturing process to prepare for the launches. GM is counting on such
entries as the new Chevy Venture minivan, Buick Regal, and Pontiac Grand
Prix to help it regain its footing in crucial market segments. The company
is hoping its falling market share finally has bottomed. Late in the year,
its share edged above 34%, up from lows near 32%. GM will earn $7 billion,
up 17%, on $160 billion of sales, Bradley calculates.
``IDEAL SITUATION.'' Chrysler Corp. management, which just successfully
introduced a new generation of its bread-and-butter minivans, is likely to
spend plenty of time planning for a spring showdown with billionaire
investor Kirk Kerkorian. If Chrysler balks at giving Kerkorian aide Jerome
B. York a board seat, a nasty proxy battle will ensue. Back on the plant
floor, Chrysler is standardizing manufacturing processes and modernizing
older factories. Bradley estimates 1996 Chrysler earnings of $3.1 billion,
up 58% from the depressed 1995 level, on sales of $54 billion.
   Even as Detroit rolls out spiffy new models, its Japanese rivals will
unveil their own new designs. And while a sky-high yen forced them to boost
sticker prices, putting them at a $2,000 to $3,000 per-car price
disadvantage, they've been slashing costs. The 1997 Toyota Camry midsize
sedan is expected to cost as much as $1,000 less than the current car.
``The Japanese manufacturers have not gone away,'' says GM's Smith. ``They
are tough competitors, and they will continue to be.''
   Japan also is expanding its lower-cost U.S. production--and even
stepping up shipments of American-built cars to Japan. ``We are importing,
not only to Japan but to 38 countries, from the U.S.,'' says Nobuhiko
Kawamoto, Honda Motor Co. president and chief executive. ``We intend to
reinforce this plan.'' Even softening in the yen last fall isn't likely to
cause Japan to back off from cost-cutting. Says Ford Chairman Alexander J.
Trotman: ``I doubt very much that they will take their foot off the pedal
just because the yen has slipped back.''
   There is a silver lining to the slackening of 1994's breakneck pace.
Back then, factories were running at maximum overtime, some key parts ran
short, and demand for raw materials renewed some inflationary pressures.
Says Kenneth L. Way, chairman and CEO of Lear Seating Corp. in Southfield,
Mich.: ``I think it's an advantage not to have deep troughs and big
peaks.''
   Instead, the industry may be bumping along on a plateau of 14.5 million
to 15.5 million unit sales annually. ``It's actually an ideal situation,''
says Chrysler Chairman Robert J. Eaton. ``It allows you to get your plants
running at maximum efficiency, get your material flowing nice and evenly,
and really focus on costs and quality.''
   And when it comes to expansion opportunities, the Big Three are casting
their eyes toward the Asia-Pacific region, where they can still turn out
basic cars on a shoestring. ``That is where most of our growth focus will
be in the next 20 years,'' says Ford's Trotman. Chrysler, which has lagged
its Detroit peers abroad, is likely to make some major international moves
this year. The company is talking with a half-dozen potential partners in
India, South America, and Southeast Asia. An alliance with a European auto
maker could also be in the cards.
   Overseas horizons may indeed appear the brightest to Detroit. Especially
if American consumers, such as Illinois car shopper Dirisamer, remain
convinced that new cars cost too much.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Lower interest rates make auto loan and lease payments more
affordable.
   -- A flood of products--Ford's Escort and new pickup and GM's family
sedans--should whet consumer appetites.

Negatives
   -- Cost-cutting and a weaker yen are making the Japanese tougher
competitors than ever.
   -- Price-conscious consumers are demanding deals.

A SHRINKING SUPPLY OF SUPPLIERS

By:
By Kathleen Kerwin and Bill Vlasic in Detroit

American auto makers will rely on fewer parts suppliers in 1996. Ford Motor
Co., for example, has reduced its stable from 10,000 to 2,300--and aims for
1,150 by decade's end. At the same time, Detroit has suppliers building a
larger percentage of the content of its cars than ever.
   What gives? The consolidation is driven by auto makers who lean on
suppliers to provide entire systems for vehicles--an entire dashboard, for
instance, instead of just the ashtray that goes into it. Detroit is handing
off more development responsibility to suppliers, too. This favors those
companies with plentiful capacity, capital, and skills. Smaller players
must merge or lose the business. Some become second- or third-tier
suppliers to the remaining giants.
   The Big Three want global supply networks. A supplier who aspires to
U.S. business in 1996 may have to be able to deliver the same parts to
factories in Germany or Brazil. Among those that analysts say may grow by
acquisition in 1996: Borg-Warner Automotive, Dana, and Lear Seating. Says
TRW Inc. Chairman Joseph T. Gorman: ``There will continue to be massive
[supplier] consolidation as markets that were once national or regional
become global.''
   Big suppliers will end up with some extra burdens. ``The cost pressures
on suppliers are still tremendous,'' says Kenneth L. Way, chairman of Lear
Seating Corp. in Southfield, Mich. ``You have to share engineering costs
and design costs if you're a tier-one [supplier].'' And auto makers keep
demanding price reductions. The focus of supplier ire for 1996 is Ford
purchasing chief Carlos E. Mazzorin, who wants suppliers to cut their
prices by 5% a year.
   Even so, Morgan Stanley & Co. analyst Stephen Volkmann projects
suppliers' earnings will rise 15% to 20% in 1996. Price increases for raw
materials have eased lately, he notes. Suppliers of car parts may suffer
spotty slowdowns, but business in truck components should remain robust.
And Japanese car companies' expansion in the U.S. provides new market
opportunities for the best U.S. suppliers.

THEY'RE HAVING A CAPITAL TIME
Savoring solid demand here, machine makers also are expanding abroad

By:
By Zachary Schiller in Cleveland


Business investment has powered the U.S. economic expansion, and that has
made machinery executives a bunch of happy campers. Shipments of industrial
machinery and equipment were up 12% through October, 1995, from a year
earlier, according to the U.S. Census, surging toward a likely record.
Their plump backlogs almost guarantee another strong year. Says Jeffery T.
Grade, chairman of Milwaukee's Harnischfeger Industries Inc., which makes
equipment for papermaking and mining: ``1996, when all is said and done,
will be a very good year for most industrial manufacturers.''
   While growth and profits won't climb much in 1996, the gains come on top
of a strong base. That's because U.S. manufacturing is itself in good
shape--and companies are convinced that they must invest to stay that way.
``All in all, people are concerned about productivity and being competitive
globally,'' says Daniel J. Meyer, chairman of Cincinnati Milacron Inc.
   A healthy U.S. market should be supplemented by faster market growth
abroad. ``Our biggest opportunity for [profit] leverage is the continued
accelerated growth overseas,'' says Thomas F. McBride, chief financial
officer at Ingersoll-Rand Co. He's especially hopeful for Asia and the
Pacific. Ingersoll is looking to add three joint ventures in China to the
three it already has there, including one that makes industrial air
compressors and another producing rock drills for mining and road-clearing.
ITT Industries Inc.'s Fluid Transfer Div. is putting a warehouse for its
pumps in Santiago, Chile. Milacron, which just started making small
injection-molding machines in a joint venture with an outfit based in
India, hopes to be producing 600 there annually within a few years.
MASS APPEAL. More machinery makers are realizing they have to intensify
global activities to keep their U.S. customers happy. ``When a DuPont or a
Dow says, `I'm building my next plant in China--I need you to step up your
capabilities,' you've got to have mass to cover the world,'' says William
M. Jordan, president of Duriron Co., a Dayton (Ohio) pump and valve maker. 
Partly with that in mind, Duriron recently bought seal maker Durametallic
Corp.
   Also fueling mergers--including Ingersoll-Rand's 1995 takeover of Clark
Equipment Co.--is that stronger balance sheets have left more machinery
makers in a position to make purchases. Indeed, there even have been some
initial public offerings in the once beleaguered machine-tool business,
such as a 1995 IPO by Hardinge Brothers Inc., a fast-growing Elmira (N.Y.)
producer of lathes and machining centers.
   Such has been the strength of machine-tool sales that the average age of
U.S. metalworking equipment began falling in 1994 for the first time in 14
years. The rejuvenation should continue into 1996.
   Even if demand dips next year for a number of machinery makers, existing
orders will provide a cushion. For instance, Alton J. Brann, chairman and
CEO of Western Atlas Inc., notes that an ``exceptional year'' of bookings
means a good outlook for 1996 sales of its Industrial Automation Group. Its
backlog for machining and other systems is up about 50% from the $415
million of a year ago.
   There are some streaks of weakness in this rosy-hued picture. The same
globalization that has U.S. executives rushing to expand abroad means
they're facing more competition. And the same modernization that makes
American manufacturers world-beaters in productivity often has led to
increases in capacity that put a damper on prices.
BUYING MOOD. What's more, there are spotty signs of a slowdown in demand.
Manufacturers' use of their factory capacity fell from 85.1% a year ago to
83.1% in November, 1995. Orders for forklift trucks, industrial air
compressors, and large plastic-molding machines have slowed in recent
months. Demand from the auto industry may taper off, and 1995's sluggish
housing market will probably mean at best a flat market for construction
equipment this year.
   Still, most machinery customers are in a buying mood. Such businesses as
chemicals, paper, metals, and food should still spend smartly. Aerospace
demand is finally rebounding. And one of the biggest stars is likely to be
farm machinery. ``The underlying fundamentals for farm equipment have never
been stronger,'' says Ted French, chief financial officer of Case Corp.,
citing strong farm income and the lowest carryover of grain stocks in 30
years. For machinery makers, the wheels are turning for a solid 1996.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Outsourcing by big companies means job shops will be buying
equipment.
   -- With manufacturers concerned about global competition, they will
continue placing orders for machinery.

Negatives
   -- There's still too much worldwide capacity in sectors such as pumps
and machine tools, keeping prices down.

METALS NEED A FEW SUPPORT BEAMS
For steelmakers, falling prices and labor issues loom large in '96

By:
By Stephen Baker in Pittsburgh


At the dawn of 1995, Matthew Botsford, chairman of World Class Steel, was
confidently raising money to build a $450 million minimill near Pittsburgh.
If anyone epitomized America's resurgence in the steel industry, it was
Botsford, an entrepreneur who had built a successful $20 million
steel-finishing business and was following in the footsteps of Andrew
Carnegie.
   These days, Botsford is an ex-executive. He's suing his old
company--after being ousted during a November board meeting and whisked
from the building by a security guard. His project had the backing of
banks, suppliers, and the state government. But Botsford had trouble
convincing equity investors--and ultimately his board--that a new minimill
could make money in a climate of falling steel prices.
   In the end, Botsford fell with a tumbling steel market. In 1995, as
demand dropped from 114 million to 110 million tons, prices plummeted, too:
Flat-rolled steel plunged from $440 to $355 per ton. Other products, such
as structural beams, thrived. But because flat-rolled is widely used in
cars, appliances, and other products, it accounts for half of steel sales
and defined the year. ``When we cut flat-rolled prices, it was on page A1
[of the paper],'' laments Nucor Corp. President John D. Correnti. ``When we
raised prices of structurals, it was on C4.''
WILD CARD. The industry could wind up on page one again this year, with
even worse news. Executives see unchanging demand in 1996. A lower level of
inventories to start the year will help avoid a replay of 1995's heavy
price-cutting. But new steelmaking capacity coming onstream will put
further downward pressure on prices, especially in the commodity grades of
steel. ``The low end of the market is going to be tough for a while,'' says
Roy G. Dorrence, vice-president for operations at U.S. Steel Group.
   The wild card this year is overseas. U.S. producers hope strong growth
in China will translate into a buying binge reminiscent of 1993. But the
key factor for 1996 will be Europe. It was a vital prop under American
steel during the first half of 1995--but then buckled at midyear. If a weak
European economy prompts producers there to step up exports, cheap European
steel could undercut U.S. producers' prices and lead to fresh trade
squabbles.
   The biggest problem for U.S. producers is homegrown, however. Before
last year's price drop, a minimill-building boom was well under way. The
new mills could add 12 million tons of low-cost flat-rolled steel to
production capacity in 1996 and 1997 combined. That's nearly five times the
capacity added in 1995. If flat-rolled could crash last year in a
relatively strong economy, what will happen to the market in a downturn,
especially when new mills come onstream? ``That's when we'll have our death
spiral,'' predicts PaineWebber Inc.'s Peter Marcus, who expects lower
profits in 1996 and an even greater crash later this decade.
STRIKE BAN. As if economic prospects weren't intimidating enough, labor
questions loom. Most integrated companies face mid-contract
wage-and-benefit negotiations in 1996. Strikes or lockouts are prohibited.
But concessions granted by arbitrators could eat into earnings.
Job-security clauses in these contracts limit the big mills' power to cut
labor costs. Instead, the producers improve yields by tweaking the
technology. In the past three years, they have added 4 million tons--the
equivalent of Nucor's entire flat-rolled production--through this so-called
capacity creep. Log one more factor in an eventual glut.
   With a world oversupply, steel faces a dilemma just like the one U.S.
aluminum makers wrestled with early in the decade. But aluminum companies,
swamped with cheap Russian metal, shuttered 30% of production and
negotiated an OPEC-style allotment plan. Prices recovered smartly in 1995,
as massive world inventories shrank by 75%. U.S. demand rose 5%, with sales
rising to 15.5 billion pounds. Aluminum looks strong again in 1996, led by
a recovery in aerospace demand. But can prices remain firm if aluminum
makers reopen shuttered smelters? For now, executives don't even mention
the possibility, for fear of spooking the market.
   In the face of such difficult markets, metal industries are more and
more battling to take business away from one another. Auto hoods,
tailpipes, and even beer cans are among the contentious areas. And if
unexpectedly slow growth in China, Europe, or the U.S. brings about a steel
glut ahead of schedule, the metal wars could grow very nasty.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Demand for steel remains hearty.
   -- World inventories of aluminum have fallen 80% in the past 1 1/2
years.
   -- China may return as a big customer of American steel.

Negatives
   -- New steel capacity coming onstream is undermining prices.
   -- With higher aluminum prices, producers may restart idle smelters.
   -- Labor concessions could hurt steel earnings.

READY-ALL JOIN ARMS
Cash-Rich and eager to merge, defense companies are thriving

By:
By Eric Schine in Los Angeles


Financially speaking, small has been beautiful for the defense industry.
For two years, defense companies have produced record profits and soaring
stock prices while merging into a smaller, more efficient industry with
fewer, bigger players. Year three of Operation Consolidation will bring
even more mergers. ``Everybody is talking to everybody,'' says C. Michael
Armstrong, chief executive of GM Hughes Electronics Corp.
   Driving the consolidation is a persistent squeeze by the Pentagon. In
1996, procurement outlays should shrink an additional 9%, to $49.7
billion--a drop of nearly 50% from the 1987 peak spending year. And despite
years of contraction, the industry must still reduce capacity by as much as
40% over the next several years, according to Wolfgang Demisch, an analyst
with BT Securities Corp. Arms exports will help, as the industry's share of
the world market, now about 52%, should grow modestly. But the biggest
gains may be logged by companies pushing forward in promising commercial
ventures, some based on defense technology.
   Leading the consolidation charge will be a handful of large contractors.
Analysts predict at least one more merger on the scale of last year's
Lockheed Martin Corp. marriage, which created a $23 billion giant.
Companies have built cash hoards as a result of cutting costs even faster
than the Pentagon reduced spending, leaving GM Hughes, Litton, Loral, and
others poised to buy.
MARRIAGE-MINDED. Makers of missiles, electronics, and airframes are in
demand. Raytheon Co. purchased the fast-growing E-Systems last year for
$2.3 billion and could easily spend an additional $1 billion in 1996. GM
Hughes, with some $5 billion in buying power, could swallow the defense
portfolio of a TRW or a Rockwell International, each accounting for about
$3 billion in annual sales. But virtually every industry sector will
attract shoppers. In 1995, General Dynamics Corp. paid just $300 million
for Bath Iron Works Corp. and its $2 billion shipbuilding backlog.
   One megadeal, sources say, could combine Boeing Co. and McDonnell
Douglas Corp. That would be a potent combination: McDonnell's $10.1 billion
in government sales with Boeing's 58% stake in the world commercial plane
market. It would solve each company's perennial weakness: Boeing covets
military orders, such as McDonnell's recent $18 billion award for C-17
transport planes. And McDonnell needs a commercial partner to counter
Europe's Airbus Industrie and a likely threat from upstart Asian
competitors. Neither company will comment publicly.
   While the big companies attract most of the attention, the
mergers-and-acquisitions market among smaller suppliers is likely to be no
less lively. ``The action is moving down the food chain,'' says Jon Kutler,
principal of the Los Angeles-based Quarterdeck Investments.
HIGH RESOLUTION. Unfortunately for thousands of aerospace and defense
workers, mergers will mean more layoffs. Even after cutting some 1.3
million jobs since the late 1980s, the industry will shrink its workforce
by an additional 30% over the next several years, says Robert D. Paulson, a
consultant with McKinsey & Co. Most of the layoffs will come as second-tier
players bail out or get bought. Two likely candidates: United Technologies
Corp.'s Sikorsky Aircraft and Textron Inc.'s Bell Helicopter unit.
   Conglomerates will take advantage of high defense prices to unload
businesses to move in new directions. Westinghouse Electric Corp., for
instance, announced in December that it will sell off its defense
businesses to help finance its recent $5.4 billion acquisition of CBS Inc.
   Entertainment and communications are fueling the defense industry's
greatest commercial success: After surpassing 1 million subscribers in its
first year of operation, Hughes' DirecTV unit has announced plans to expand
its satellite-TV service globally. And a consortium that includes Lockheed
Martin and Raytheon has invested more than $500 million to provide
high-resolution satellite images to real estate agents and farmers,
potentially a $2 billion-plus market.
   Such reassuring signs, together with the consolidation craze, have Wall
Street predicting another year of bulging profits. BT Securities' Demisch
expects defense and aerospace profits to rise at least 15% in 1996, to
about $5 billion. Downsizing is painful, but for those who hang on, the
rewards can be formidable.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Consolidation moves forward: Look for at least one more mega-merger
and continued capacity reduction.
   -- Modest growth in the Pentagon's procurement budget is likely, while
overseas sales could strengthen.

Negatives
   -- Profit margins will be squeezed as stingier contracts kick in. The
lucrative B-2 bomber and F-22 fighter programs may be stretched or killed.

`UNEXCITING MIGHT BE GOOD'
Few surprises in the oil patch. but with profits so healthy, who cares?

By:
By Gary McWilliams in Houston


The oil patch has made its peace with low prices. Relentless restructuring
and cost-cutting are delivering strong cash flow and higher profits despite
anemic pricing. Even in today's oil market, initial public offerings and
secondary stock sales are letting small independents fund new production
and property acquisitions without incurring debt.
   Executives are prepared for more of the same in 1996. ``We don't see
many things out there that look any different to us than 1995,'' says
Timothy C. Headington, chief executive of Headington Oil Co. in Dallas, a
small crude-oil producer that has been steadily expanding with cast-offs
from Exxon, Texaco, and others.
   Most important, there's little evidence that prices will take a spill.
Oil averaged $18.40 a barrel in 1995, and many forecasters expect it to
remain there. ``I see no reason for the 1996 numbers to change by more than
25 cents a barrel,'' insists Robert Gillon, senior analyst at market
watcher John S. Herold Inc. What little encouragement exists is in U.S.
natural-gas prices, which should recover to about $1.80 per thousand cubic
feet--up from $1.48 in 1995. That would put them back around 1994 levels.
STEADY AS SHE GOES. The major oil companies should see their earnings rise
a modest 6% in 1996, thanks to a healthy economy's thirst for more oil,
says Frederick P. Leuffer, senior energy analyst at Bear, Stearns & Co. He
foresees demand growing next year by about 2%. While hardly as robust as
high tech, oils look like a safe haven. ``It's lackluster and sort of
unexciting right now,'' says Leuffer. ``But unexciting might be good'' were
the Dow to reverse course.
   There are a couple of iffy assumptions in this steady-as-she-goes
outlook. The biggest is that OPEC, which has suffered a steady loss of
world oil market share, continues to accept the losses. Some analysts are
concerned that OPEC countries may attempt to regain share by boosting their
production. Or that Iraq may return with significant new supplies. For now,
neither seems likely.
   Even if prices were to drop, restructuring and new technology have made
U.S. oil companies more able to cope. The best are finding fresh ways of
exploring and managing. A money-saving technique pioneered by Amoco Corp.
and Royal Dutch/Shell Group: pooling their assets in low-profit production
regions. The two are forming a joint company to merge West Texas and New
Mexico operations--and slash overlapping costs.
3-D IMAGING. Technology continues to lower costs, too (chart). Vastar
Resources Inc., a 1993 spin-off of Arco's U.S. oil and gas operations, says
its exploratory wells now hit pay dirt 60% of the time--as a result of
technologies such as three-dimensional seismic imaging--compared with only
47% of the time using older techniques. What's more, says CEO Michael E.
Wiley, ``I think there will be some creative ways [cost-cutting] can
continue.''
   With expenses falling, prices don't have to rise much for production
increases to flow straight to the bottom line. Next year's outlook is for a
solid 7% rise in crude-oil production--with even higher increases for
Texaco, Amoco, and Shell. Texaco, which hasn't boosted production for
nearly a decade, predicts a 40% production rise within five years, thanks
to rich prospects in the North Sea, Latin America, and China.
   While petrochemicals were the big contributor to last year's heady
profits at Phillips Petroleum Co. and Amoco, prices have softened--as
supply has caught up with demand. The question now: Will China, a huge
buyer that withdrew from the market in 1995, return in 1996? Bob Gower,
chief executive at chemical maker Lyondell Petrochemical Co., predicts
China's return could mean a second leg to the chemical boom. ``All the
information we have suggests we're not at the end of the cycle, but in a
transition period,'' he says.
   Retailing should continue to deliver profits, too. Continued reshuffling
of gasoline outlets--as companies concentrate on specific markets--has
turned the cyclical business into a reliable profit center. ``We're seeing
retail margins better than any time in history,'' says James E. Acridge,
CEO of Giant Industries Inc., a Scottsdale (Ariz.) refiner and
Southwest-area retailer. For years, stock analysts urged Giant to quit the
business. No longer. ``We're smart guys all of a sudden,'' he says. Stable
prices and lower costs are making a lot of people look smart these days.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Firmer gas pricing and savings from corporate restructurings should
produce stable profits.
   -- Advances in technology are lowering costs for exploration and
drilling.
   -- Gasoline retailing profit margins are at historic highs.

Negatives
   -- Petrochemical profits may soften further, cutting refining margins.
   -- OPEC could seek to recoup markets from non-OPEC suppliers.

A TIME TO REAP GLOBAL REWARDS
With demand and output growing, the U.S. could again dominate world
markets

By:
By Greg Burns in Chicago


Corn and soybean farmer Robert Mullins doesn't get excited too easily. But
from where he sits on an 1,800-acre spread in rural Shabbona, Ill., the
export outlook is cause for celebration: ``Spectacular,'' he says. ``It's
really coming alive.''
   The next year could bring an export bonanza for Mullins and other
farmers, as U.S. agriculture begins dominating world markets again. The
U.S. share of agricultural trade will rise to about 21% in 1996 after
falling as low as 16.7% in 1986. The value of U.S. exports will push up to
nearly $60 billion (chart), thanks to booming demand, reduced global trade
barriers, and a more competitive U.S. Farm Belt. U.S. farmers have long
considered exports the missing link in their pursuit of higher prices: ``If
Mother Nature cooperates, and we get a good crop, we could have the full
package for a change,'' says Mullins.
   In 1995, Mother Nature had other ideas. Heavy rains delayed spring
planting through much of the Midwest grain belt. Two months later, a summer
heat wave baked the earth rock hard. Then a killing frost in late September
put a chill on the autumn harvest. With the crop stunted and plagued by
disease, production of corn plunged from 10 billion bushels in 1994 to 7.3
billion in '95, sending U.S. corn stockpiles to 20-year lows. For the year,
corn futures prices had soared 51% as of Dec. 14, soybeans 31%, and wheat
25%. Big rewards went to farmers who produced decent crops in spite of the
weather, then held out for the best prices late in the year. But predicting
such explosive rallies can be tricky: ``With our reserves of feed grains at
historic lows, it makes the markets more volatile,'' says Patrick H. Arbor,
chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade.
SHRINKING SET-ASIDES. Still, the near-term trend is positive: Supplies have
tightened at a time of heavy demand, especially from Asia. Spending by the
Japanese, the largest importers of U.S. agricultural products, will reach
$11.3 billion in 1996, up from $10.5 billion in 1995, according to
projections from the U.S. Agriculture Dept. South Korea and China,
benefiting from robust economies, will increase imports as well. U.S. red
meat, fruit, and vegetables, along with grain, will be sought-after
commodities. ``We have tremendous export-market potential,'' says analyst
David C. Nelson of NatWest Securities Corp. in New York.
   U.S. farmers will be planting fence post to fence post this year. As of
mid-December, the government appeared to be all for it: Proposed reforms
would eliminate annual set-aside programs that support prices by idling
cropland. Instead of paying farmers not to farm, the government would
provide fixed payments, shrinking each year, based on how much they
received in the past. With this change, the amount of corn, wheat, and
soybean acreage in production should jump by about 10% in the coming
season, analysts estimate. As the reforms stood at the end of '95, they
would have little effect on cotton, rice, sugar, peanut, and dairy farmers,
who would retain key subsidies.
   The additional land for grain crops will be a modest plus for fertilizer
companies such as IMC Global, Freeport-McMoRan, and Potash. But the biggest
potential for those companies lies overseas. In China, for example, average
grain yields run about 50% behind those of the U.S. Yet rapid economic
growth has the huge Chinese population clamoring for a better diet. The
simplest way to boost yields: more fertilizer. The less developed world
will be pouring on the potash, says Wendell F. Bueche, chief executive
officer of IMC. ``There's nothing more dangerous than hungry people. You've
got to keep your population well-fed,'' he says.
   Other nations' efforts to improve farming techniques won't threaten U.S.
market share right away. Greater use of fertilizer, pesticide, and hybrid
seed, as well as increased mechanization, could level the playing field
someday. But the U.S. retains a big advantage in low-cost production. And
the demand is huge. China's consumption is projected to grow even faster
than its yields. And the former Soviet Union--a potentially huge
competitor--has seen its output crash along with the rest of its economy
over the past five years, with no comeback in sight.
   Even if the U.S. produces a bumper crop in 1996, many bins will remain
empty: ``We're not going to be flush with supply for at least several
growing seasons,'' predicts Daniel W. Basse of the AgResource consultancy
in Chicago. For the rest of this decade, the world will be depending on
U.S. farmers.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- With world grain supplies at record lows and a farm bill that
encourages greater production, U.S. farmers will plant fence post to fence
post.
   -- Export demand for agricultural products will soar.

Negatives
   -- With less government protection, farmers will be vulnerable to trade
problems.
   -- Uncertainty over the Farm Bill could complicate planting plans.

IT'S A GOOD YEAR TO GET HITCHED
'96 could be tough, so papermakers will continue to merge

By:
By Seanna Browder in Seattle


For a few crazy months early in 1995, making paper was akin to printing
money. As demand outran supply, prices for white paper took their most
dramatic leap since World War II. The jump of 38% per ton in Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.'s paper and paperboard composite index drove up profits an
estimated 180% for 1995 at the 19 largest wood and paper companies. As
paper executives tell it, the temptation to add new capacity was almost
unbearable. But remembering a binge that turned to bust earlier in the
decade, they resisted. ``The memories are still fresh of what it feels like
in a down cycle with too much capacity,'' says Lynn Michaelis, Weyerhaeuser
Co.'s director of marketing and economic research.
   Good thing. Fearing ever-higher prices, customers stockpiled paper. By
summer, the bloated inventories undermined the sky-high prices, and they
tumbled an average of 11%. Even without big new investments, the American
Forest & Paper Assn. expects production capacity for pulp and paper to rise
3% in 1996, largely because of efficiency improvements. And that may be
enough to push prices down, says Merrill Lynch & Co. analyst Sherman Chao.
Chao predicts that prices of pulp and paper could decline as much as 19% in
1996 on steady volume. This spells lower profits, though nothing resembling
the industry's dive in the early '90s.
   Without any hope for booming demand, expect paper and pulp companies to
spend 1996 cleaning up balance sheets or plowing ahead with industry
consolidation. ``In our business, it is more favorable to buy assets than
build new plants,'' says John A. Georges, International Paper Co.'s chief
executive.
ELECTION YEAR. Acquisitions already are rolling. Kimberly-Clark Corp.
gobbled up Scott Paper Co. for $9.4 billion in December. Earlier in the
year, International Paper agreed to buy Federal Paper Board for $3.5
billion, and paid $1.15 billion for a controlling stake in Carter Holt
Harvey, New Zealand's largest timber-plantation owner. Boise Cascade sold
its Rainy River Forest Products unit to Canada's Stone-Consolidated and
acquired a 6.4% interest in Stone. In 1996, look for plenty more deals, as
the powerhouses buy slices of global markets and extend their reach over
raw materials.
   As the year begins, demand for white paper is lolling at 7% below
year-ago levels. Demand should recover smartly in 1996, especially in
coated papers used in glossy advertising, which should be bolstered by a
Presidential election and the Atlanta Olympics. ``The coated grades are
holding their own,'' says Paul C. Latta, an analyst at Ragen MacKenzie in
Seattle. Newsprint, though, which climbed 40% in price from 1994 to 1995,
could be headed for a fall. Inventories are at record levels, and high
prices are dampening demand.
   Recycling should continue to attract much of the growth in the pulp
industries. Minimills, which convert old cardboard into pulp, are
proliferating as such companies as Weyerhaeuser and Boise Cascade Corp.
expand. Recycled materials should jump 26% in 1996, while production of
marketwood pulp--the product of virgin wood chips--rises just 0.3%,
according to the American Forest & Paper Assn. The extra pulp will go into
producing more linerboard, kraft paper, and corrugated paper, creating a
plentiful supply of those products and damping their prices, says Larry
Katz of Pacific Crest Securities in Portland, Ore.
HOUSEBOUND. The lumber industry, meanwhile, is struggling against competing
materials and a surge of imports. Canadian lumber now accounts for around
35% of the U.S. market, up from 28% in 1989. At the same time, growing
numbers of builders are substituting steel for wood, with steel-frame
housing growing from 500 to 80,000 houses in the past four years. And total
housing starts will rise only modestly in 1996, to around 1.4 million. All
that should spell a continued slump in lumber prices.
   Meanwhile, the wood industry will press ahead with such promising
engineered products as oriented strand board, a cheap new kind of
fiberboard. By 1998, there should be over 7 billion feet of oriented strand
board capacity, up from zero in 1988, estimates L. Pendleton Siegel, CEO of
Potlatch Corp., based in San Francisco. This should claim fully 50% of the
fiberboard capacity, prompting a brawl. ``There's going to be a bloody
market for the next two years,'' says Siegel. So don't be surprised to see
a few of the losers get gobbled up by the industry giants.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Demand for coated paper used in advertising should be bolstered by
the Presidential election and Olympic Games.
   -- Producers avoided bringing on fresh capacity when prices soared.

Negatives
   -- Mills making cheap, new engineered wood products will prompt a brawl
in the fiberboard market.
   -- The lumber industry faces intense competition from Canadian
producers.

THE WEB KEEPS SPREADING
The new market should grow 100% and create even greater opportunities

By:
By Neil Gross, with Amy Cortese, in New York


Netscape Navigator. Java. Yahoo. These pioneering products and services for
using the World Wide Web--and their creators--stole the headlines in 1995.
But Web software is still just a blip on the software radar screen. In
1996, Web-related programs--from browsers such as the Navigator to
``firewalls'' that protect corporate data--will be worth less than 1% of
the $100 billion-plus global software market, says Hambrecht & Quist Inc.
analyst J. Neil Weintraut (chart).
   What the numbers don't show, however, is the subterranean shock wave the
Web has sent across the software industry. Not only is the potential
huge--with annual growth of 100%, sales of Internet programs could hit $4
billion in 2000, Weintraut reckons--but the rush of millions of PC users
into cyberspace could change every aspect of the software business. The
race to cater to cybernauts has unleashed the biggest epidemic of startup
fever seen in years. And companies such as Microsoft, IBM, and Oracle are
now scrambling to make the Internet part of their core strategies.
   Once again, the software industry is exuberantly reinventing itself.
Indeed, the Internet revolution comes as growth in other software
categories is slowing. Sales of mainframe programs have been bumping along
at single-digit growth rates, and Anthony Picardi, a group vice-president
at International Data Corp., figures the $19.3 billion mainframe software
market will grow less than 2% over the next four years, to $19.6 billion in
1999.
READY TO JUMP. The huge market for personal computer office
``suites''--collections of programs that include spreadsheets, word
processing, and presentation graphics programs--is also reaching
saturation. But sales are poised for a 20% cyclical jump in 1996, as
millions of PC users upgrade to Windows 95, predicts Goldman, Sachs & Co.
analyst Rick G. Sherlund. The hottest market will remain software for
so-called client-server computing--which should grow at 40%, he figures.
   All told, says IDC's Picardi, the global market for packaged
software--about 75% of it made in America--will grow 10% in 1996, to $102
billion. The number would be bigger if not for mainframe software, which
makes up nearly 20% of worldwide sales. ``Other industries would die for a
similar growth rate,'' Picardi says.
   And what about the new ``Webware''? In 1995, businesses set up Web sites
like periscopes, to see what was going on. This year, as they toy with the
idea of electronic commerce across the Net, many companies will start using
internal Web sites as windows into their own networks--creating
``intranets.'' Says analyst Rich Edwards at Robertson, Stephens & Co. in
San Francisco: ``Every software company will have to participate.''
   No question, intranets are coming. Corporate computer managers
increasingly see Web pages as a means to inexpensively publish and share
information internally. This is very much what Lotus Development Corp. had
in mind with Notes, a ``groupware'' program that helps teams of employees
share documents or business applications simultaneously over a network. On
the Net, much of this can be done on shared Web ``pages''--for a fraction
of what it costs to buy, install, and customize Notes. Lotus, acquired by
IBM for $3 billion last summer, is furiously rejiggering Notes for the
Net.
   Meanwhile, Web software startups--including Netscape Communications
Corp.--can cash in. Companies such as Cambridge (Mass.)-based Vermeer
Technologies Inc. and OpenMarket Inc. should do a brisk business selling
software that helps companies build and maintain Web sites.
   The Web is also driving demand for new programming tools such as
object-oriented software languages. Versant Object Technology in Menlo
Park, Calif., ParcPlace-Digitalk in Sunnyvale, Calif., and Steven P. Jobs's
NeXT Computer are tailoring their programs--which let programmers build
software from reusable chunks of code--to run across the Internet. The
upshot: Sales of object-oriented programs should double from this year's
$300 million, according to IDC.
   This explosion of Web activity has forced most software giants to
rethink their game plans. Microsoft Corp. is building Internet links into
all of its software products, from office suites to operating systems, and
the software giant is licensing Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Java programming
language. IBM has also made the Internet a priority: Big Blue has created
an Internet software unit. Oracle is offering a family of Web programs,
including a ``browser'' and Web versions of its database software.
   One reason industry executives and analysts gush over cyberspace: It is
one of the few domains where Microsoft is not dominant. A quick look at the
packaged software market explains why that matters. Most of this year's
growth in office suites will go directly to Microsoft, which owns about 90%
of the $3 billion market. In addition, a large portion of multimedia
CD-ROMs sold this year will be Microsoft titles. Goldman's Sherlund figures
Microsoft's net will hit $2.2 billion in calendar 1996--up 20% over last
year--on sales of $8.7 billion, up 16%.
SOUPED UP. Another place where Microsoft has not been able to dominate is
client-server computing. In 1996, big corporations will continue to
downsize their computer operations from mainframes to networks of
servers--usually souped-up PCs or Unix workstations--and PC ``clients.'' In
the process, they'll pump billions of dollars into client-server databases
from Sybase, Informix, and industry leader Oracle, whose sales will jump
40% in 1996, to $4.9 billion, predicts Sherlund.
   Microsoft is far from discouraged in client-server software. A server
version of Windows NT is replacing Unix on many corporate networks and the
software giant expects strong sales in 1996 from its long-awaited
relational database upgrade, called SQL Server 6.0. It is expected to sell
for a fraction of the price of Oracle, Sybase, and Informix programs. And,
Microsoft plans to package SQL Server with other server programs, such as
systems management packages, and offer the bundles at steep discounts.
   Mainframe software vendors have also hopped on the client-server
bandwagon. Take Computer Associates International Inc. The Islandia (N.Y.)
software maker's revenue from client-server software grew 79% in the first
half of 1995 from a year earlier, while mainframe software sales--still 70%
of the company--grew just 18%.
   Continued corporate downsizing is another boon to software makers.
Having already stripped away layers of middle managers, many large
companies are trying to squeeze out further efficiencies. One way is to
junk disparate computer systems that run various operating units.
``Integrated enterprise software,'' supplied by the likes of SAP, Baan, and
Oracle, does the job (box). Another way to boost efficiency: automating
customer support. Newly public companies such as Vantive, Clarify, and
Remedy have software that creates electronic files, or ``cases,'' from each
customer query or complaint. Later, anyone in sales, marketing, or customer
support can call up the entire history of the transaction. Hambrecht &
Quist's Weintraut figures sales of such ``customer interaction systems,''
roughly $400 million in 1995, could grow to $3 billion by 2000.
   Merger mania swept through software in 1995 and is likely to continue in
1996. Computer Associates bought Legent, IBM bought Lotus and, in December,
SoftKey International Inc. pulled off a hostile deal to take over Learning
Co. On Dec. 20, Informix Corp. bid for Illustra Information Technologies.
But, with the Net spawning new startups every day, for every company that
gets merged out of existence, two new ones are bound to appear.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Windows 95 will spark demand for educational, entertainment, and
business software.
   -- Businesses are rushing onto the Web, spawning markets such as digital
commerce.

Negatives
   -- Diversity in desktop software will shrink as Microsoft's clout grows
and Apple's shrinks.
   -- Heavy discounting of software suites--and growing development
costs--will make life harder for small players.

YOUR DATA SHOULD MEET MY DATA

By:
By Neil Gross in New York, with Gail Edmondson in Paris

Hark back to the old days in the computer industry--about two years ago. A
salesperson at Digital Equipment Corp. could drill down in a company
database to fish out technical specs for a customer. But the data produced
might not match what a Digital inventory manager kept separately on her
desktop computer, resulting in annoying delays while users cross-checked
their information.
   That's why Digital and dozens of other companies are hot on so-called
``integrated enterprise software.'' The idea is to junk all the old
``legacy'' systems that separately handle a large company's customer
orders, inventory, shipping, and logistical information, and replace them
with a single set of programs to run the company. That way, all the data
look the same, regardless of who's tapping in or where they work.
   Large multinationals already have installed billions of dollars' worth
of these systems. This has flooded the coffers of industry leaders SAP in
Germany and Baan in Holland. Americans missed the first wave, but now
Oracle Corp., Microsoft Corp., and others are plunging in. The sector is
poised to grow 14% worldwide, to $11.1 billion in 1996, according to
International Data Corp.
   The market for related services is a gold mine, too. Deloitte & Touche's
consulting arm rakes in $200 million a year advising SAP customers. It's
``a phenomenal success,'' says Darvis Cormier, a D&T international
director.
   Such services don't come cheap: A switchover can cost a large
manufacturer $100 million, making it ``the most expensive systems decision
a company has ever made,'' says Dick J. Fishburn, chief information officer
of Digital, which is installing SAP software.
    And if your company buys such a system, your integration problems
aren't instantly solved, warns Vinnie Mirchandani, an analyst with Gartner
Group, based in Stamford, Conn. He calls enterprise systems ``a 40%
solution masquerading as a 100% solution.'' Still, a 40% solution is better
than none. And that should put plenty of wind underneath the wings of
software and services companies in this hot niche.

THIS YEAR, SERVERS WILL BE KING
PCs are everywhere. Now the spotlight is on machines that can link them

By:
By John W. Verity in New York


For more than a decade now, the computer industry has been driven by a
vision of giving everyone his or her own computer. Large organizations have
rushed to put a PC onto every desktop and stopped expanding their budgets
for mainframes. Engineers switched in droves from sharing minicomputers to
running their own workstations. Families have scooped up millions of PCs,
too, for use in home offices and to entertain the kids.
   Now, with personal computers seemingly everywhere, the spotlight is
shifting back to larger computers--the kind that can do work for many
different people at once. Collectively known as network servers--everything
from souped-up PCs selling for $10,000 to mainframes and
supercomputer-class systems costing millions--big iron will be in for the
most technical change and competitive action during 1996 and the following
few years. ``Servers are regaining their place as the fulcrum of business
computing,'' says Gregory Garry, analyst at Dataquest Inc. ``They're the
centerpiece of the network.''
   Servers also remain the sweet spot of the computer market, offering
gross margins of 30% to 50%, vs. the 15% or less seen in PCs. ``Servers are
clearly the healthiest segment of the computer industry,'' says Laura
Conigliaro, computer analyst at Prudential Securities Inc. In corporations,
small servers store files and move E-mail for departments. Giant servers
can act as data warehouses--massive libraries of detailed product, sales,
and financial information gathered from across an organization's many other
computers. The World Wide Web, with close to 100,000 servers in place and
hundreds more being attached every week, is also a major contributor to
server demand.
PRICE-CUTTING. All told, International Data Corp. (IDC) estimates that
shipments of servers based on PCs--machines using Intel chips or souped-up
versions of Apple's Macintosh--will grow 35%, to 1.05 million units, from
777,000 in 1995. Shipments of servers based on proprietary hardware
designs, from companies such as Hewlett-Packard Co. and Sun Microsystems
Inc., will increase about 15% in 1996.
   At the same time, PC sales will remain strong. Dataquest estimates that
U.S. consumption of PCs in 1996 will hit 25.6 million units, up 16% from
1995 (chart). Worldwide consumption will grow by 19%, to 68.7 million
units. Price-cutting will stunt growth in dollar terms: IDC reckons total
U.S. spending on PCs will be up only 12.6% over 1995.
   The news in other categories is mixed. Workstation shipments are
projected to grow from 847,000 units in 1995 to 982,500 units in 1996.
Sales of IBM-compatible mainframes will fall, from $7.5 billion in 1995 to
$7.1 billion in 1996, as a line of cheaper machines based on
microprocessors grows more popular.
THE PREFAB FOUR. Although booming, the server market may be in for some
jarring changes in 1996, thanks to Intel Corp. Along with its new
top-of-the-line P6, or Pentium Pro, microprocessor, Intel has launched a
complete circuit board containing four P6 chips. This Quad P6 board is
designed specifically as a building block for low-cost servers. Like the
prefabricated motherboards from Intel that helped relatively small Packard
Bell and Gateway 2000 beat IBM and Compaq to market with the first
Pentium-based PCs, the Quad P6 board could put lots of new players into the
server business overnight and change the market's economics. Bottom line:
Margins will begin to resemble those of the cookie-cutter desktop-PC
market.
   Intel's Quad P6 won't just affect the low end of the server business.
Companies such as Sequent Computer, Chen Systems, and Data General plan to
gang as many as a dozen of the boards together to produce systems that can
outperform traditional mainframe computers for a fraction of the cost.
PaineWebber Inc. computer analyst Stephen K. Smith figures that P6-based
servers will sell for less than half the price of proprietary servers at
the same performance level. It's ``one of the most significant hardware
developments to impact the computer industry since Compaq cloned the IBM
PC,'' he says.
   Luckily for HP, Sun, and other companies making non-Intel-based servers,
Quad P6-based machines won't start shipping in volume until late 1996, and
there will be a lag before software can be readied to take advantage of
them. But the warning shots have been fired for another major battle in an
industry that seems to thrive on turmoil.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- As computers get cheaper, they will become even more central to the
economy.
   -- Electronic commerce is fueling demand for high-capacity Web servers.

Negatives
   -- Standardized parts and designs will gnawat the profitability of
midrange and large computers.
   -- Personal-computer makers will feel more pressure from Intel's gradual
entry into PC manufacturing.

SILICON GOES FROM PEAK TO PEAK
In a boom that could last a decade, turning out enough chips is the big
problem

By:
By Robert D. Hof in San Francisco and Otis Port in New York


For the companies that plant those teensy transistors on the silicon chips
from which personal computers and other electronic gadgets sprout, 1996
shapes up as the fourth consecutive year of 20%-plus growth--26%, according
to the Semiconductor Industry Assn. That's remarkable. Chipmaking has long
gyrated through boom-and-bust cycles every three years or so. And while
growth in 1996 won't match 1995's spectacular 40% sales jump, analysts
still look for chipmakers to post per-share earnings gains averaging 29%.
   The outlook is for steady growth until 2000, and perhaps beyond.
``There's going to be a black hole for computing power for at least a
decade,'' says Gordon A. Campbell, chairman of startup 3Dfx Interactive
Inc., which makes chips that accelerate onscreen graphics for multimedia
PCs. The optimism isn't limited to Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. Vladi
Catto, chief economist at Texas Instruments Inc., says the industry might
expand by 20% a year for the next two decades. By comparison, since TI made
the world's first microchip 36 years ago, the industry has averaged 15%
annual gains.
OFF THE ROLLER COASTER? To be sure, not every sector is booming. The growth
rate for multimedia PCs seems to be slowing, for example. No matter. Most
chipmakers won't be able to satisfy demand anyhow unless the whole PC
business falters. ``The rate at which semiconductors are going into [a
widening profusion of products] has just skyrocketed,'' says G. Dan
Hutcheson, president of chip watcher VLSI Research Inc. This ever-expanding
base of customers means producers are becoming less vulnerable to a hiccup
in any one market, adds Jean-Philippe Dauvin, chief economist at European
chipmaker SGS-Thomson Microelectronics. That's a key reason why the
industry believes its roller-coaster cycles are a thing of the past. While
chipmakers can't escape broad economic swings, these ups and downs will be
a merry-go-round ride by comparison.
   Because PCs remain the main engine boosting silicon's rocket for now,
the immediate beneficiaries will be the makers of dynamic random-access
memory (DRAM) chips and, of course, Intel Corp. New PCs gobble two to four
times as much memory as older models, so DRAM shipments could soar 40% this
year. As for Intel, look for the microprocessor king to sell 25% more
``brain'' chips this year than in 1995.
   Despite fatter sales, Intel cautions that its incredible 55% gross
margins could shrink, because of its rapidly growing business in PC
motherboards and plug-in boards. On the other hand, some analysts say
Intel's profits could actually improve. Its chip sales are shifting
dramatically from 486 microprocessors to higher-priced Pentium models
(chart), and Intel may pare prices less aggressively. That's because
up-and-coming microprocessor rivals such as Cyrix and NexGen--soon to
become a division of Advanced Micro Devices--aren't cranking out enough
chips to cramp Intel's style. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. recently said its
fourth-quarter profits would fall short because it isn't grabbing as much
486 business from Intel as it hoped.
   NexGen Inc. and Cyrix Corp. are hardly the only companies facing a
capacity squeeze. In fact, lack of capacity will rob the chip industry of
several percentage points of potential growth this year. ``Everybody's
straining just to get enough fabs out,'' says Ray Stata, chairman of Analog
Devices Inc. ``Fab'' is chip-speak for wafer-fabrication plant, the
squeaky-clean factories that make semiconductors.
   Scarce capacity means continuing pain for the fabless companies that
often design the industry's leapfrog chips. To guarantee production of
their next wonder circuits, several fabless companies are buying into chip
producers. Cirrus Logic Inc., the biggest fabless company, plans to spend
$2 billion over the next five years. Part of the money will go for a 15%
stake in United Silicon, a new chip factory in Taiwan.
   Wafer fabs now cost as much as $1.3 billion each, and the industry will
need to pour the foundation for a new one every week, figures TI's Catto,
if chips are to reach the $331 billion level predicted for 2000 by market
researcher Dataquest Inc. However, until investors share the industry's
newfound confidence that chips have outgrown their boom-and-bust days, the
stock market could gum up Dataquest's long-range timetable. Absent that,
the silicon horizon has a bright golden glow.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- PCs continue to boom, driving sales of memory chips and Intel's
Pentium microprocessors.
   -- Use of chips in a growing variety of products will smooth the
traditional boom-and-bust cycles.

Negatives
   -- Capacity shortages could hurt producers of memory chips and
chipmakers that contract out.
   -- Investor jitters about possible market slowdowns could sink stocks
and limit chipmakers' investing in new plants.

THE NOT-SO-CALM BEFORE THE STORM
All hell will break loose when deregulation hits. For now, business is
strong

By:
By Catherine Arnst in New York


The telecommunications industry is setting off on a great adventure in
1996: The forces of competition are being unleashed in all parts of the
business for the first time. However, most of the year will be a
profit-boosting calm before the storm--``the last good year before
competition starts in earnest,'' says Simon W. Flannery, an analyst at J.P.
Morgan Securities Inc. ``The cable companies rolling out telephones, the
Bells getting into cable, PCS [wireless] systems being switched on--all the
things we're just guessing at at the moment will start coming into focus in
'96.''
   Congress had tried for two decades to pass legislation that would
overhaul the 1934 rules regulating telecommunications. Finally, at the tail
end of 1995, Congress was able to write a sweeping telecom-deregulation
bill that allows long-distance carriers, local phone companies, and
cable-TV operators to enter one another's markets. And even without
Congress, about half the states are freeing up local phone markets. By next
January, competition should be busting out all over.
   The telecom legislation allows long-distance and cable-TV operators into
the local phone market immediately. Local monopolies can offer long
distance and cable TV outside their regions at once, and in-region as soon
as competition is established. If there are no hitches, Bell Atlantic Corp.
Vice-Chairman James G. Cullen predicts that consumers in some parts of the
country will be able to choose a local phone company by the end of 1996.
GRAB A PARTNER. As all the industry's players scramble to ready themselves
for this brave new world, expect to see a flurry of alliances,
partnerships, and outright acquisitions. Bell Atlantic Corp. and Nynex
Corp., which have teamed up in three wireless and entertainment
partnerships already, are likely to offer long- distance together as well.
Analysts say other such pairings are probable. And look for buyouts of
small long-distance and alternative-access companies such as WorldCom and
MFS Communications.
   In the meantime, business is booming. Demand for Internet access, the
growth of telecommuting, the huge popularity of cellular phones, and a
surge in data transmission all make telephony a growth business.
Long-distance calling traffic accelerated by 8% in 1995 and is expected to
grow another 8% this year. Local phone companies should add access lines at
a rate of 3% this year, compared with 1% to 2% earlier in the decade.
   The result: Phone companies are bringing in money like never before.
Steven R. Yanis of Oppenheimer & Co. expects revenues for the three biggest
long-distance carriers--AT&T, MCI Communications, and Sprint--to grow by
8.2% in 1996, to $118 billion, while the seven Baby Bells should see 3.2%
growth in revenues, to $96 billion.
   Once competition starts, price wars will break out and margins will be
under pressure. Plus, the phone companies have to start getting ready for
competition now, an expensive task. Market researcher Forrester Research
Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., predicts that the top local and long-distance
carriers will need to spend $30 billion over the next three years to
bankroll their competitive strategies. J.P. Morgan estimates that capital
spending is expected to increase to $130 per phone line, from $120 per line
in 1995.
   The local phone monopolies in particular must develop a competitive
mindset. ``They really need to get much more focused on customer service,''
says Larry R. Levitan, managing partner for Andersen Consulting's
communications group. For proof, just look at a new study from Deloitte &
Touche: Nearly 40% of corporate telecom managers say they would be likely
to switch from their traditional local-service provider if given a choice
of comparable quality. That's why industry analysts think phone companies
with large rural territories and few corporate customers, such as SBC
Communications Inc. and U S West Inc., are best positioned for the
deregulated world, since they are the least likely to face competition.
   With the Bells freed to enter new markets such as long distance and
cable, deregulation should be a ``win-win'' for everyone in the long run,
says Yanis. ``I truly believe that competition will increase the size of
the whole market. This will not be a zero-sum game. It's a positive-sum
game.'' And the starting gun is about to go off.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Deregulation will unleash a wave of investment and creativity.
   -- Demand is booming. Long-distance usage keeps rising, and households
are adding second lines in record numbers.

Negatives
   -- While deregulation is in sight, state and federal agencies must work
out hundreds of details first.
   -- Carriers will have to spend billions of dollars to get into one
another's markets.

ROBUST AND READY TO BRAWL
Drugmakers are flush, so more mergers--even hostile ones--may be on the
horizon

By:
By Joseph Weber in Philadelphia


With stock prices setting records and earnings climbing at double-digit
rates again, pharmaceutical executives are heading for maybe their best
year since the roaring '80s. More unit sales, more freedom to raise prices,
and savings from restructurings are hypercharging growth. ``We're not in
the doldrums of the early '90s anymore,'' says Robert L. Andrews, a
Deloitte & Touche managing director.
   Heavy margin pressure, sharp staff cuts, and deep discounting are fading
as fast as memories of President Clinton's election-year attacks on
drugmaker price-gouging. For 10 leading U.S. and European drugmakers, net
income this year may rise as much as 12%, to $18.6 billion, while sales
climb 8%, to $106.2 billion, estimates Cowen & Co. analyst Stephen Scala.
The healthiest companies could repeat 1995's 20% earnings gains.
   Yet execs can't afford to be complacent. Mergers have reshaped the
industry, and more may be on the way. The biggest companies gain an edge in
funding research and development, bargaining with managed-care buyers, and
competing globally. By mid-December, the industry had tallied $41.2 billion
in deals, up from 1994's record $36.1 billion, according to Windhover's
directory, 1995 Health Care Strategist.
TWISTED ARMS. Foreign buyers set the pace in 1995, led by Glaxo Holdings'
record-breaking $14 billion purchase of Burroughs Wellcome, Hoechst's $7.1
billion acquisition of Marion Merrell Dow, and the stock-for-stock merger
of Upjohn and Pharmacia, valued at $7 billion. Hostile deals, such as
Johnson & Johnson's $1.8 billion takeover of Cordis, a maker of cardiology
devices, could bring an unwilling partner or two to the altar this year.
Says Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. analyst Neil B. Sweig: ``The white
gloves are off.''
   Who's next? Industry titans Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Eli Lilly & Co.
figure prominently in Wall Street speculation as potential acquirers of the
midsize likes of Monsanto Co.'s Searle & Co. unit or perennial merger
target Warner-Lambert Co. Well-heeled Swiss drugmakers Ciba-Geigy Ltd. and
Sandoz Ltd. also make likely buyer lists. Japanese drugmakers, whose
stockholders are wrestling with tough times generally, could be alluring to
global buyers.
   Acquisitions aren't always the right tonic. Merck, SmithKline Beecham,
and Lilly are still chasing a payoff from pharmacy-benefit managers, the
distribution operations for which they together have paid $13 billion since
1993. At the same time, Rite Aid Corp. and other drugstore chains are
building competing units. After shelling out $6.6 billion in 1993 for Medco
Containment Services Inc., a big benefit manager, Merck & Co. has turned
cool toward all kinds of mergers. Says CEO Raymond V. Gilmartin: ``Major
acquisitions would be a diversion for us.''
STICKER SHOCK. Acquisition fever may be tempered, too, by slightly more
pricing freedom. ``Companies are less inclined to give discounts and reduce
prices,'' says Wayne P. Yetter, chief executive of Astra Merck Inc. Indeed,
some prices--chiefly to retail drugstore buyers not covered by insurance
plans--have been climbing faster than inflation.
   The industry's financial health conceals a shortfall of novel
blockbusters. While drugmakers squeeze ever more sales out of big producers
such as cholesterol-fighters and antidepressants, few have offered truly
new potential $1 billion sellers recently. One likely exception: the
osteoporosis treatment Fosamax, a drug from Italy's Istituto Gentili being
marketed by Merck in the U.S. Another potential big winner is J&J's
Risperdal, a schizophrenia treatment.
   Drugmakers aren't helping their cause by limiting R&D. The
Pharmaceutical Research & Manufacturers of America says the 8% growth in
industry R&D spending in 1995 was the lowest in more than two decades. ``I
worry that by reducing the rate of increase in research, we are going to
reduce the opportunities'' for new drugs, says Schering-Plough CEO Richard
J. Kogan. He says his company will outpace its peers in 1996, boosting its
$650 million in R&D spending by more than 10%.
   R&D cannot be neglected. Pfizer Inc. credits new drugs for boosting its
net income an estimated 20% last year, to about $1.6 billion, on a 23% rise
in sales, to $10.2 billion. This year, analysts expect Pfizer to nearly
match that growth. Luckily for Pfizer's competitors, this won't be the year
they'll have to pay for underinvestment. There's enough right with the drug
business that there will be plenty of gains to go around.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- More providers are using medicine instead of surgery or
psychotherapy.
   -- Pressure against price hikes is easing, helping broaden profit
margins.
   -- Wider uses are being found for big sellers such as
cholesterol-reducers.

Negatives
   -- With few new blockbusters, drugmakers will battle to sell more of
what's already in the medicine cabinet.
   -- Merging companies are jeopardizing their futures by cutting R&D.

THE MEDIA CIRCUS IS STILL IN TOWN
Thrills and chills as global demand keeps the buying frenzy going

By:
By Ronald Grover in Los Angeles


It has been more than a decade since television host Monty Hall looked
behind that curtain for the last time. But in the frenzied media world,
every day seems to be a rerun of Let's Make a Deal. Walt Disney Co. plunked
down $19 billion in stock and cash to buy Capital Cities/ABC Inc.
Westinghouse Electric Corp. bought CBS Inc. News Corp. Chairman Rupert
Murdoch jumped on the Internet, launched a sports channel to rival ESPN,
and then made plans to beam TV signals to Latin America. And in cable? Last
year, a staggering $25 billion in deals were struck, as nearly one in five
subscribers saw their cable companies change hands.
   In 1996, the media dealmaking won't be confined to the TV and movie
businesses. USA Today publisher Gannett Co. is still on the prowl after
completing its $1.7 billion purchase of Multimedia Inc. Other publishing
deals may be in the offing. Spurring on the activity is an unquenchable
worldwide thirst for American-made movies and TV programs--and a surprising
rebound in Americans' appetite for the printed word.
   Programming and distribution entities will keep getting married in
1996--programmers to ensure an outlet for their works, distributors to fill
their pipelines. General Electric Co. is likely to go shopping for partners
again this year, after failing in 1995 to persuade Disney to buy a
half-interest in its NBC Inc. unit. Possible candidates: Seagram's MCA
subsidiary, which includes Universal Pictures, or Sony's Hollywood-based
studios. Microsoft Corp., a partner with NBC in an on-line news channel,
could also be a bidder. After buying CBS, Westinghouse is still looking to
bolster its programming and could strike an alliance with a Hollywood
studio as well. ``The idea is to protect yourself from being shut out as
the big get bigger,'' says Merrill Lynch & Co. analyst Jessica Reif.
NET GAINS. Propelling the movement toward bigness in 1996 is the expected
passage of the long-awaited federal telecommunications bill. Among other
things, the legislation would immediately allow cable and telephone
companies to compete in one another's markets and gradually raise ceilings
on the number of radio and TV stations a company can own. That should
prompt a new wave of acquisitions, says Gene F. Jankowski, managing
director at Veronis, Suhler & Associates Inc., a New York investment bank.
Among those rumored ready to sell is billionaire Ronald O. Perelman, whose
New World Entertainment Inc. broadcast and production company is loaded
with debt.
   Media companies will benefit in 1996 from a robust advertising market
that for the third year running should outperform the overall economy.
Boosted by the Olympic Games in Atlanta and U.S. political campaigns,
domestic advertising in all media should grow by 7.8%, to $174 billion,
predicts Robert J. Coen, a senior vice-president at ad agency
McCann-Erickson Worldwide. The four major broadcast networks will be among
the biggest winners, with a projected 12.5% increase, to $13 billion.
NEW SYSTEMS. The ad increase isn't the only good news for network
television. After losing audiences to cable and syndicated programming for
years, the number of sets tuned into the networks will stabilize in 1996 at
roughly 64% of those viewing TV, predicts Veronis Suhler. But not every
network will survive. Time Warner Inc.'s struggling Warner Bros. network
will likely seek a merger with startup UPN, a joint venture of United
Broadcasting and Viacom Inc.'s Paramount Pictures Corp.
   Cable television, meanwhile, will seek growth by adding services rather
than subscribers. After adding 9 million subscribers over the previous five
years, the industry's customer base will grow by roughly 1 million in 1996,
according to Veronis Suhler. To maintain the cash-flow growth, cable
companies will need to build systems to battle the telcos, and many cable
companies will introduce modem services for high-speed data transfer later
in 1996. Other companies, such as Tele-Communications Inc., will move
aggressively overseas into markets with greater potential to add
subscribers.
   Foreign companies--which have sat on the sidelines since the disastrous
foray of Japanese companies in Hollywood--will also reemerge on the
American media scene. The sale of Tur-ner Broadcasting System Inc. to Time
Warner alerted many of them to the dwindling number of companies available
to fill the Information Superhighway with films and TV shows. Dutch
electronics giant Philips' PolyGram entertainment unit will aggressively
seek an acquisition. So might German media powerhouse Bertelsmann, which
recently opened a flashy Los Angeles headquarters. One likely target is
MGM/UA, which is rising from the ashes with such films as GoldenEye and Get
Shorty. The studio's owner, French bank Credit Lyonnais, recently hired
investment bankers Lazard Freres & Co. to sell off the studio.
PAPER PROFITS. Other bidding wars will feature Sony Corp.'s Los Angeles
film unit and Thorn EMI's record division. Murdoch is a possible bidder for
EMI. So is Disney, which has a small record company with few stars. The
biggest bidding war, however, could center on Sony. After parting ways with
U.S. CEO Michael P. Schulhof, Sony is likely to try unloading a piece of
its film company. Sony insiders say Murdoch has expressed interest.
Investment bankers say GE is eager to line up more content for
broadcasting. And, despite his frequent denials, Microsoft Chairman William
H. Gates III may also be interested.
   Hollywood production will increase in 1996 to satisfy the booming
foreign market and domestic cable operators. The year will feature more
than the usual numbers of retreaded oldies. Universal Pictures, with fresh
capital from new owner Seagram, will churn out films based on old TV shows
McHale's Navy, Flipper, and Sergeant Bilko. Tom Cruise will headline a film
version of Mission: Impossible from Viacom's Paramount Pictures unit.
   The newspaper business lacks Hollywood's glitz but had a marquee year in
1995, with earnings gains of 14.8% at 11 big newspaper publishing
companies, according to Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette (DLJ) Securities Corp.
McCann-Erickson's Coen says that in 1996, advertising revenue will increase
by a modest 5.5%, to $4.25 billion, down from an 11% rise through the first
nine months of 1995. That will dampen industry earnings growth to an
average of 6.5% in 1996, DLJ says.
   Those kinds of returns don't satisfy many newspaper publishers, who say
they need to make drastic cost reductions to ensure their long-term health.
``We're starting to see a little breathing room, but not an awful lot,''
says Mark H. Willes, Times Mirror Co.'s new CEO. In 1995, Willes cut
hundreds of jobs at the flagship Los Angeles Times and closed the New York
City edition of Long Island-based Newsday.
   Still, newspaper companies are hardly turning their backs on their
printing presses--high paper prices and the Info Highway notwithstanding.
Evidence of that is Gannett's purchase of Multimedia. Also, in 1996, The
New York Times will launch a Northeastern edition, while the Los Angeles
Times will revive plans to distribute its paper in Washington, D.C.
   Why the newfound optimism? For one thing, readership of newspapers is up
as the number of Americans 35 and over expands. Those demographics will
also help book and magazine publishers. In 1996, a slew of new specialty
magazines will likely hit the newsstands. Century 21 Real Estate Corp., for
instance, will launch a new home magazine with Hachette Filipacchi
Magazines Inc. Book publishers intend to expand their lines to fill the
shelves of book superstores and discount chains. Hearst Corp. will soon
launch its first hardcover line for adults. Even MTV will have its own book
line, geared to the under-35 crowd.
   Which media companies will strike the audience's fancy in 1996? That's
hard to say. But these days, if you can't produce a hit you can always buy
the hitmaker.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- The Olympics, the election, and a revived economy should increase TV
ad revenue by about 8%.
   -- Telecom deregulation will spur a burst of investment by phone
companies in cable TV.
   -- Foreign demand for U.S. entertainment remains strong.

Negatives
   -- Technology disappointments will slow adoption of interactive TV.
   -- Smaller players may be shunted aside.

THE BABY BELLS TAKE THEIR FIRST STEPS IN TINSELTOWN

By:
By Ronald Grover in Los Angeles

As he stood before his shareholders at Ameritech Corp.'s annual meeting,
chatting via a video hookup with Mickey Mouse, Chief Executive Richard C.
Notebaert left little doubt that the telephone companies' pin-striped world
had definitely gone Hollywood. In 1996, in a wide swath of head-to-head
confrontations from San Diego to Chicago, the Baby Bells intend finally to
launch their attack on the cable-television industry.
   The sweeping telecommunications bill in Congress would allow phone
companies to challenge cable operators outside their home markets
immediately, and within their regions once they prove their phone business
faces competition. At first, phone-company offerings won't look all that
different from what TV viewers get now by handing over $40 to $50 each
month to their local cable companies. Down the road, however, the phone
companies hope to beat the cable companies to the interactive market with
such features as home shopping and games. ``The idea is to outdo the cable
companies, not just match them,'' says Howard Stringer, chairman of the
Tele-TV venture that includes three of the seven Baby Bells.
   First off, the telcos plan to offer more channels. In Glendale Heights,
Ill., Ameritech's network of optical fiber and copper cable will offer 90
channels, compared with the local cable operator's current 60. In
Riverside, Calif., where the 90 channels will be delivered over the air
through a system called wireless cable, the reception is expected to be
sharper. With only 15% of Riverside County receiving cable, Pacific Telesis
Group expects to make inroads by stuffing marketing literature into the
weekly phone bills it sends in the area.
   The telcos won't lack programming firepower, either. Walt Disney Co., a
partner with three of the Baby Bells and GTE Corp. in another joint
venture, has assigned top animators to work on tailor-made programming,
including a souped-up on-screen guide. As for Tele-TV, Stringer says it has
a production facility ready for action. For phone companies, Hollywood will
be quite a change from selling call-waiting service.

THE PATIENT IS STABLE-FOR NOW
Health-care costs are in check, but the industry's upheaval isn't over

By:
By Keith H. Hammonds in New York


A deceptive peace has descended on the nation's $750 billion health-care
industry. There has been no word of a major health-maintenance organization
merger for months. Hospital giant Columbia/HCA appears too occupied
digesting the acquisitions of years past to indulge its unrelenting
appetite. And once again, reform sits deadlocked on Capitol Hill.
   But just wait: Beneath the surface, a revolution rages on. ``The pace of
change is stunning,'' says Dr. W. Allen Schaffer, head of managed care at
CIGNA Healthcare Inc. ``We have to reevaluate our strategic assumptions
every six months.'' Managed-care plans snatched some 5 million Americans
from their traditional health insurers in 1995, bringing total enrollment
in HMOs to 56 million. Those are powerful numbers, and managed care now
calls the shots. This year, it likely will force more consolidation than
ever.
   The industry, still fragmented and unwieldy, remains eminently ripe for
restructuring. Even though health-care inflation has slowed, spending
continues to edge upward as a share of the nation's economy (chart).
Massive overhead associated with excess capacity remains, and ``the only
way to slow growth in health-care spending is to debloat the system,'' says
John F. Hindelong, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities
Corp.
   That process is under way. Indeed, employers saw their health-care costs
drop in 1994 and remain flat in 1995 as millions of workers moved into
cheaper managed-care plans. Employers' costs will probably rise slightly on
average in 1996 as fewer additional employees switch to managed care,
according to Foster & Higgins consultant John Erb.
TEAMING UP. The cost squeeze means more upheaval for doctors and hospitals.
``The market works, but it is very painful,'' says Robert L. Montgomery,
chief executive at Alta Bates Health System in Berkeley, Calif. Alta Bates,
forced to hold managed-care charges flat for a third straight year, has
joined a hospital consortium to amass a total of 600,000 managed-care
patients--the better to negotiate with ever-larger HMOs. Even big,
for-profit chains are looking at admissions increases of only 1% to 3% in
1996, says DLJ's Hindelong, though consolidation will help the sector lift
earnings by 15% to 20% next year.
   The motivation is irresistible: As of Dec. 15, 1995, the industry had
seen a record 433 mergers and acquisitions, according to Securities Data
Co. Increasingly, those mergers are crossing industry boundaries--producing
new ``integrated delivery systems'' that put hospitals, doctors, nursing
homes, and others under the same corporate roof. The object: one-stop
shopping for managed-care companies, who require access to a broad array of
services, says Coopers & Lybrand consultant Glenn A. Shively.
CRAWLING REFORM. At the same time, HMOs are themselves driving for size,
market penetration, and efficiency. Growth certainly won't come from rate
hikes: Even the better HMOs will win premium increases of just 1% to 2%
this year, says analyst Kenneth Abramowitz of Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
Rather, the HMOs need new bodies. Many will see big revenue gains this year
as more Medicare recipients move into managed-care plans--a shift that
would accelerate if health-care reform succeeds.
   And what of reform? Republicans and Democrats alike want to cut back on
payments to Medicare service providers. And doctors and hospitals face an
enormous hit from a proposed provision requiring payment reductions if
total Medicare spending exceeds budget. The outlook for Medicaid is
particularly cloudy--one reason many insurers are staying away from the
business.
   In any case, governmental change will prove, as always, far less
powerful than the market-driven charge for critical mass and market muscle.
The resulting shakeout will be dramatic. Industry executives suspect that
Aetna Life & Casualty and CIGNA, both on the verge of shedding hunks of
their property-and-casualty businesses, could spend huge sums to turn their
middling health businesses into national HMOs.
   Such new players, if well-conceived and adequately funded, could
transform a compartmentalized industry that until now has fought its
battles largely within cities or regions. ``By the end of the decade, we
will begin to see the endgame appear,'' says Gennaro J. Vasile, a longtime
hospital executive who recently became head of Gemini Consulting Inc.'s
North American health-care practice. And some fair hints should come even
sooner.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- For-profit hospitals should continue to gain market share and see
admissions rise modestly.
   -- Well-managed nursing homes will pick up business as hospital stays
continue to shrink.

Negatives
   -- Rising cost pressure from managed care, plus lower Medicare and
Medicaid rates, will keep a squeeze on margins.
   -- Health-care reform hasn't addressed the uninsured, who will put an
even greater strain on the system.

PICKING UP SPEED
Airlines are finally in the clear--and railroads may link up

By:
By Wendy Zellner in Dallas


Transportation services expect modest growth in 1996, with airlines and
railroads faring best and truckers bringing up the rear. All three sectors
are focusing on improving productivity--and keeping a close eye on the
merger scene.
   Airline executives are happiest: After five years of losses and
retrenchment, the industry has finally recovered. Net profits in 1995
totaled about $2 billion, vs. a $279 million loss in 1994. In a sentiment
widely echoed by his peers, Continental Airlines Chief Executive Gordon M.
Bethune says: ``It's a pretty rosy-looking '96.''
   With traffic expected to grow only about 3% in 1996, airline profits
will hinge on keeping costs in check and capacity usage up. That won't be
easy. Unit costs will rise 1.5% to 2% for the major carriers, after holding
steady in 1995, says analyst Samuel Buttrick of PaineWebber Inc. ``We've
picked the low-hanging fruit,'' agrees Delta Air Lines Inc. CEO Ronald W.
Allen. ``It's going to get tougher from here on out.''
   The good news for airlines is that capacity should grow more slowly than
traffic, meaning fuller planes and higher fares. Systemwide capacity for
U.S. airlines grew about 2.5% last year, and it's likely to show a similar
increase in '96, estimates David A. Swierenga, chief economist for the Air
Transport Assn. That bodes well for fares. True, the rapid expansion of
such low-cost carriers as Southwest Airlines Co. and ValuJet Airlines Inc.
will help to hold fares down. But Edward P. Gilligan, executive
vice-president for American Express Co.'s Travel Management Services,
predicts that airfares will rise an average of 3% to 4% this year, with
only limited and carefully targeted discounting.
BOLD COMBINATIONS. The airlines' discipline is expected to translate into
higher profits. A bullish Steve Lewins of Gruntal & Co. figures major
airlines' earnings will soar 56% from 1995's modest level. The rising
profits complicate carriers' efforts to wrest major concessions from their
pilots so they can better compete with lower-cost carriers. Still, pilots
at American and Delta have recently announced a willingness to consider
wage and work-rule changes on short-haul routes that airlines have been
farming out to other carriers.
   There's still one unsettling question as the industry reaches cruising
altitude: Will airline mergers mar the flight plan? A new round of
dealmaking could distract execs from rebuilding balance sheets and
improving service. United Airlines Inc. decided last year not to pursue a
marriage with USAir Inc. And American says it won't strike first. Still, no
one rules out a new wave of merger mania in 1996.
   Railroads, in contrast, are already pursuing bold combinations. Union
Pacific Corp. is seeking government approval for its $3.9 billion
acquisition of Southern Pacific Rail Corp. Its deal comes in response to
Burlington Northern Inc.'s $4 billion purchase last year of Santa Fe
Pacific Corp., creating, at least for now, the nation's largest railroad.
And takeover rumors continue to swirl around companies such as Conrail Inc.
Meanwhile, U.S. railroads are expected to be bidders this year in the
privatization of Mexico's railroads.
   Even without such deals, investors have much to cheer about. Merrill
Lynch & Co. analyst Michael H. Lloyd expects modest revenue gains of 4% to
5% this year for the major railroads, but operating profits should grow at
double that pace, thanks to productivity increases and cost-cutting. The
new Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp., for example, has already slashed
jobs and has also identified almost $1 billion in operating cost savings
over the next few years.
   Labor remains a wild card as the railroad industry bargains with about a
dozen unions to reach new contracts. But bargaining is off to a strong
start with a tentative accord with the United Transportation Union,
representing 25% of workers.
   Truckers are hoping simply to bounce back from a bleak 1995. The
industry has been hammered by a slowing of U.S. economic growth, a downturn
in exports to Mexico, and excess capacity. After a banner 1994, bullish
trucking companies rapidly expanded their fleets with bigger trucks. Now,
with softer demand and lackluster earnings, analysts expect a shakeout.
Swift Transportation Co., for one, is hoping to benefit: The company has
made four acquisitions since 1991 and is prowling for more. Truckers will
have to satisfy themselves with such hardscrabbling while railroads and
airlines enjoy a relatively smooth ride.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Airline capacity should grow more slowly than traffic, meaning fuller
planes and higher fares.
   -- Railroads are boosting productivity with computerization and faster
locomotives.

Negatives
   -- Airlines will be hard-pressed to win cost reductions from labor when
profits are soaring.
   -- The trucking industry is suffering from excess capacity.
   -- Railroads have yet to sign contracts with about a dozen unions.

WHERE THERE'S A WILL, THERE ARE MISTAKES

By:
EDITED BY AMY DUNKIN
Grace Weinstein

Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis made the right moves when it came to estate
planning. Many people do not, deterred either by the thought of dying or by
the seeming complexity of well-made plans.
   Don't be put off. After all, you can't take it with you. If you're not
careful, however, you can sure make a mess of leaving it behind, making
Uncle Sam richer and your family poorer in the process. ``It'' is your
hard-earned property. The mess is what happens if you make one of these
all-too-common estate planning mistakes:
-- Ignoring the whole thing. Seven out of 10 Americans reportedly die
without making a will. ``The single most important thing you can do,'' says
Stephan Leimberg, professor of taxation and estate planning at The American
College in Bryn Mawr, Pa., ``is get your papers in order and figure out
what you want to do.''
   Then, follow through. Remember, if you die without a will, you're
leaving it up to your state to decide who gets what. If you're married,
your assets may be split among your spouse and children. If your children
are minors, your spouse would then have to get permission from the court to
spend ``their'' money on their behalf. If you're not married, your closest
blood relatives would inherit your worldly possessions--even if you have a
close friend you would prefer.
   Living trusts, pushed in some quarters as a probate-free substitute for
a will, have advantages and disadvantages. A living trust, which is
revocable and takes assets out of your name, can be helpful if you live in
one of the few states, such as California, with high probate fees or if you
want backup should you become incapacitated. A living trust is a good
``standby vehicle,'' says Bill Knox, a trust attorney with Neuberger &
Berman in New York, because the trustees you have named can manage your
affairs if you cannot. But you won't save on income taxes with a living
trust. And, unless all of your assets are owned by the trust, you won't
avoid probate. You'll still need a will to take care of any assets not
sheltered by the trust at the time of your death.
   You can prepare a legal will yourself, using software programs such as
Nolo's WillMaker (about $40, 800 992-6656). But if your affairs are
complicated--if you have remarried or own investment real estate--you would
be better off consulting an attorney experienced in estate planning.
   Once you draft it, don't file your will and forget it. Make a list of
all your assets and liabilities, so that your family won't flounder in
ignorance when you're gone. Then keep this list current and review your
will every few years, more often if there are changes in tax law or your
own family circumstances. Marriage, divorce, newborn children or
grandchildren, or a move to another state should all be triggers for
updating your will.
-- Using the $600,000 exemption from federal estate taxes only once. Joint
ownership can undermine good estate planning by wasting the second $600,000
estate exemption otherwise available to the surviving spouse. So can using
what Ralph Engel, an attorney with Rosen & Reade in New York, calls a
``sweetheart will,'' in which you leave everything to your spouse.
Solution: Divide assets so that each spouse separately owns at least
$600,000, then leave the first $600,000 in each estate in a bypass or
credit shelter trust. The survivor can receive income from the trust, and
tap principal, but after the second spouse dies the remainder goes to the
children or other designated beneficiaries free from estate tax.
-- Failing to plan specifically for substantial retirement assets.
Accumulated retirement funds--individual retirement account, 401(k), or
profit-sharing--make up a large portion of the estate for many
middle-income Americans. In fact, it can be difficult for some couples to
divvy up asset ownership if one spouse has a sizable retirement plan. If
you don't recognize the potential tax bite on large plan accumulations, you
could wind up losing as much as 85% of your retirement money to a
combination of estate, income, and excise taxes.
   Estate taxes start at 37% and go up to as much as 60%. An excise tax of
15% applies to so-called excess accumulations at death of $1.5 million or
so as well as to excess distributions during life of more than about
$150,000 a year (the specific amount is a moving target because it depends
on your age at the time of death and current Internal Revenue Service
interest rate assumptions). Income tax kicks in if your beneficiaries must
pull money out of your ira to pay any estate taxes that may be due.
   You won't solve the problem by putting retirement money in trust. Engel
cites an instance in which a trust was named beneficiary of a six-figure
retirement plan. Because of that setup, the surviving wife, who could
otherwise have left the money untouched until she reached retirement age,
couldn't do an ira rollover, so the money was immediately subject to income
and estate tax.
   One approach is to begin withdrawing your own retirement money early.
Don't wait until the mandated withdrawal age of 70 1/2 if you will be
accumulating so much money that you'll be subject to excise tax. Steven
Lockwood, president of Lockwood Pension Services in New York, suggests that
if you have other assets you can pass to your heirs, you should ``plan to
deplete your ira by age 90'' rather than leaving it in your taxable
estate.
-- Holding on to more money than you need. Successful people sometimes
don't realize until late in life that the government may get half of what
they leave behind. By then, says Knox, ``it's too late to make much of a
dent in the looming tax losses.''
   There are multiple solutions here. Start by making what Knox calls
``invisible lifetime gifts.'' These are grants of up to $10,000 per person
per year, as well as direct payments of tuition or medical bills, that are
not subject to gift tax. Giving these gifts to your family members while
you're alive removes the money--and its subsequent appreciation--from your
taxable estate. By helping your children buy a house or your grandchildren
attend summer camp, such gifts also let you enjoy the fruits of your
generosity along with the recipients.
   If your estate is sizable, you may want to consider making larger gifts
as well. Giving appreciating assets is the idea here, so that future growth
is removed from your taxable estate. The cost basis for determining capital
gains on inherited assets is fixed at the time of death, or ``stepped up''
from the original purchase price, while the cost basis of assets you give
during your life is what you paid. Hold on to assets that have already
appreciated significantly, otherwise your heirs will lose the benefit of
this stepped-up basis at death and owe capital gains when they sell on the
entire appreciation from your date of purchase.
   Gifts of up to $10,000 per year ($20,000 for a married couple) are never
subject to tax. On larger gifts, a gift tax return will have to be filed,
but the tax itself will not be due until your death. That's when the
unified gift and estate tax kicks in on amounts (whether given during life
or after death) in excess of approximately $600,000.
   Charitable gifts can also reap large rewards. The American College's
Leimberg makes reference to Jacqueline Onassis, who may have sheltered as
much as $90 million out of a $100 million estate by setting up a charitable
lead trust. No one knows exactly how much was in the Onassis estate, but
attorneys recognize the astute estate planning.
   With a charitable lead trust, a specific sum is set aside. The charities
of your choice receive a fixed amount each year, typically based on a
percentage of the original amount, for the period of time you specify. At
the end of that period, your children or other beneficiaries receive the
principal. Because the gift to the children has been deferred, Knox
explains, it is discounted for tax purposes. Furthermore, if the trust's
return on investments is higher than anticipated, the excess goes to the
children without tax.
   Charitable lead trusts are most often used by the very wealthy. Their
mirror image, charitable remainder trusts, are more common. With a crt, you
receive both an immediate tax deduction and income during your lifetime
(and, if you wish, that of your spouse), with the principal then going to
charity. No estate taxes are due on amounts left to charity through the
trust.
-- Insisting on simplicity, at the expense of what could be significant tax
savings. Knox points out that people who have built successful businesses
or professional practices are often ``impatient with, or even distrustful
of, estate planning techniques they can't easily understand.'' Used to
making and controlling their destiny, ``they can't bring themselves to do
something complicated that doesn't make complete sense to them, no matter
how great the tax savings for their families,'' he says.
   One approach is to search out good advisers and then rely on their
recommendations. You don't have to understand the technicalities, so long
as you understand the consequences in terms of tax savings and your control
over your assets.
-- Failing to read documents. No matter how good the recommendations from
your advisers, you really do need to peruse all the documents and have your
attorney answer any questions that you may have. Mistakes can creep in if
you're not paying close attention. Michael Allmon, chairman of the
California Society of cpa's estate planning committee in Los Angeles, cites
a client who made several specific bequests of property, but never noticed
that their addresses were incorrectly listed. ``We think we can take care
of his intent,'' Allmon says, ``but we will have to get the court involved
to do so.''
-- Thinking that estate planning is only for the rich. If anything, says
Leimberg, preparing your will is much more critical for the middle
class--or those people with estates under $1 million. ``If a wealthy person
loses $100,000 because of poor or no estate planning, the world won't come
to an end,'' he says. ``But it's tough when you have a smaller estate.'' In
other words, most of us can't afford to make any mistakes.



Five Rules of Estate Planning

MAKE A WILL
This might seem obvious, yet 7 of 10 Americans die without one. If you
neglect this important piece of business, you're essentially granting your
state the right to decide who gets what.

USE A BYPASS TRUST IF MARRIED
For sizable estates, the couple divides the assets and each spouse puts up
to $600,000 in a trust. This ensures that both get to use a $600,000
federal estate tax exemption.

WATCH RETIREMENT ACCUMULATIONS
If your IRA or qualified plan amounts to more than $1.5 million, you may
want to start withdrawals early so you don't bump up against the excise tax
on excess accumulations.

FIND EXPERT HELP
Refer to self-help software and books. But if your affairs are at all
complicated, use an attorney experienced in estate planning. Read
everything and ask questions--even experts make mistakes.

START ``GIFTING'' EARLY
If you have enough to live comfortably, giving up to $10,000 a year
($20,000 for a married couple) to each child and grandchild can greatly
reduce your taxable estate.

STEERING CLEAR OF TITLE TROUBLE

By:
Richard Korman

When stage great Helen Hayes died in 1993, her son, James MacArthur,
inherited her Victorian mansion overlooking the Hudson River in Nyack, N.Y.
MacArthur arranged to sell the house for $730,000 to Christopher and
Georgine Chalsen, who planned to live there with their five children. A few
weeks before the scheduled closing last June, a title researcher found
buried in the public records a 29-year-old right of first refusal that
Hayes had granted to a neighbor. After much frustration and weighing of
legal options, MacArthur honored the agreement, and the neighbors bought
the house. They removed a strip of land connecting the Hayes property and
their own to the river bank and put the house back on the market at
$849,000. With the river access gone, the Chalsens declined to pursue a
deal.
   The fiasco over the Hayes mansion, known as Pretty Penny, is an example
of how a defective title can kill a real estate deal that both parties
badly want to complete. No matter how much you feel that you've finally
found your dream home, don't get in too deep unless you're sure the house
clearly belongs to the seller or that you won't get involved in a
bottomless legal pit. Refusal rights, liens, easements, or boundary
disputes are the type of problems to watch out for.
   But even the seller doesn't always know. MacArthur was unaware that the
refusal right existed, much less that it had passed to the couple next door
when they bought their house from his mother's original neighbors a few
years ago. Hayes had granted an unlimited right to all ``heirs, executors,
administrators, successors, and assigns'' of the neighbors. Says Alan
Wayte, a Los Angeles attorney: ``That's a mistake, and a very common one.''
What Hayes should have done is restrict the refusal right to her original
neighbors or limit its duration.
   The broader issue is that title searches are often left until it's too
late to prevent both parties from spending a lot of money and effort
getting ready to close. A title is evidence that an owner has the right to
possession. Mortgage lenders require a search to assure that the property's
title is free and clear of claims or any other problems. The search may
show that the seller has a former spouse who is a co-owner but knows
nothing of the sale; a trucking company has an easement that allows it to
drive through the property during the night; or that the toolshed was built
two feet over the boundary of a neighbor's lot and the problem needs to be
resolved. It should also show any liens for unpaid taxes or mortgages.
EARLY REQUEST. The key is not to let the title check wait until after you
have completed other aspects of the deal, such as mortgage approval and
arranging to move. If possible, obtain a pre-approved mortgage before going
out to shop for a house, suggests Gary W. Eldred, author of The 106 Common
Mistakes Homebuyers Make (And How to Avoid Them) (John Wiley & Sons,
$14.95). Getting mortgage approval out of the way allows everyone involved
to concentrate on the title and other matters, he says.
   The minute your bid on a house is accepted, start researching the title.
Ask the seller's lawyer or broker to send a copy of the title report from
the property's most recent sale and the proposed contract, says Eric
Gonchar, MacArthur's attorney. Also ask for the most recent property survey
and certificate of occupancy.
   Before the contracts are signed, make sure you or your bank orders the
search from the company that will issue your title insurance. Also get a
copy of the summary report. It shouldn't take longer than two weeks. Don't
wait until the property is appraised or until your loan is approved. If
possible, have the abstract of the title and property survey before your
closing or moving dates are made. That way, if there are problems that will
take weeks or months to resolve, you won't have to undo preparations to
move from your current residence and inconvenience your buyer or tenant.
   Title searches and reports cost $150 to $500 and, if the deal closes,
that cost is rolled into the title-insurance bill. If the title report
turns up information that makes closing impossible, most home-sale
contracts require the seller to pay the buyer's title-search fee and
related title-examination costs.
   Although MacArthur picked up the tab for $1,000 of title-research costs,
Christopher Chalsen says he still spent $700 on the inspection. Chalsen
recalls that he told his lawyer to hurry to get the title information, but
he and his wife signed the contract before the data were in hand. Luckily,
the Chalsens eventually found another house. It hadn't belonged to a famous
actress, but its title was free of anything that could have turned the
purchase of the home into a tragedy.



Before You Seal the Deal...
-- Get the title search done as early as possible, well in advance of
closing and arranging to move. Press lenders, real estate agents, and
attorneys not to neglect this part of the deal. Try to get a mortgage
approved early so you can concentrate on the title.
-- Seek the title data from previous sales and refinancings prior to
signing a contract. Ask for copies of the survey and certificate of
occupancy as a tip-off to trouble involving boundaries or illegal
structures.
-- Always buy title insurance. Be sure the policy covers the owner, not
just the mortgage lender. Try for a policy that insures the full equity in
addition to the mortgage amount.

A PANGLOSS FOR THE MILLENNIUM

By:
BY MICHAEL J. MANDEL

THE STATE OF HUMANITY
Edited by Julian L. Simon
Blackwell 694pp $54.95

No one can accuse Julian L. Simon of thinking small. In his new book, he
tackles nothing less than the fate of all mankind. The State of Humanity, a
massive new volume of essays assembled and edited by Simon, is an attack on
the fashionable notion that human progress has stalled. ``Just about every
important long-run measure of human welfare shows improvement over the
decades and centuries, in the United States as well as in the rest of the
world,'' claims Simon in his introductory essay. ``There is no persuasive
reason to believe that these trends will not continue indefinitely.''
   This happy assessment is no surprise. In previous books, Simon, an
economist at the University of Maryland, has argued the benefits of
population growth and immigration, giving him a well-deserved reputation as
perhaps the most optimistic economist alive. His argument that humanity is
still on an upward trend is backed up by almost 700 pages of hard data and
numerous charts and graphs. Simon and his co-authors, including Nobel
prize-winning economist Robert W. Fogel, have put together what is probably
the single most concentrated mass of upbeat statistics ever assembled,
covering virtually every aspect of the human condition, from child
mortality to air pollution, from housing and food to natural resources and
ozone depletion.
   For the most part, the arguments are convincing. We have been warned
that the world is about to run out of oil. Not so, Simon points out: Global
crude-oil reserves have soared over the past 15 years, as higher prices
have stimulated exploration and new technology for exploiting existing
fields. In 1980, the world had about a 30-year supply of crude oil at
current rates of consumption. By the early 1990s, though, the world had
about 45 years' worth. Notes Simon: ``Metals, foods, and other natural
resources have become more available rather than more scarce.''
   The perspective of Simon and his co-authors is decidedly global. While
developed economies such as the U.S. have struggled in recent years,
developing countries such as China, Taiwan, and Malaysia have seen
explosive income growth, making this the greatest period of wealth creation
in history. These economic gains have been accompanied by other advances,
as well. Over the past 30 years, life expectancy in poor countries has
soared, from 46 to 63 years. The spread of education in developing
countries has been equally spectacular: The proportion of children aged 6
to 11 enrolled in school has risen from less than 50% in 1960 to about 70%
today.
   Interestingly, Simon's upbeat view does not depend on new technology.
The State of Humanity barely takes notice of computers. There is no mention
of the Internet, virtual reality, gene splicing, cellular telephones, or
any of the other marvels that are supposed to be boosting productivity and
improving the modern standard of living.
   Instead, Simon bases his forecasts on a simple principle: Assume that
long-term trends will continue, in the absence of convincing evidence to
the contrary. So if the steady accumulation of knowledge has produced a
rising standard of living for the past 200 years, there's no reason to
believe that things will suddenly change.
   Of course, many would consider Simon's view of the world to be naive.
The conventional wisdom is that global overpopulation is inexorably leading
to ecological and economic disaster--a modern version of Malthusian misery.
``For those who think the future may be a simple extrapolation of the past,
there may be some surprises ahead,'' observes Lester R. Brown, president of
Worldwatch Institute, in the forthcoming book State of the World 1996
(Norton). Brown, as committed a pessimist as Simon is an optimist, argues
that the ``spiraling human demands for resources are beginning to outgrow
the capacity of the earth's natural systems.''
   Food, especially, will be in short supply, in part because the people of
China and other growing nations will demand better diets as they become
richer. Notes Brown: ``Oil can be replaced with other energy sources, but
there is no replacement for food.''
   The State of Humanity tries to answer each of these negative arguments.
Despite the fears, Simon cites statistics from the Environmental Protection
Agency to assert that ``the air in the U.S. and in other rich countries is
irrefutably safer to breathe now than in decades past.'' Moreover, there is
no sign of any widespread food shortages yet. Crop yields have risen as
fast as world population. The price of food, like that of other natural
resources, is still falling compared with other goods and services.
   Simon points out that in every era, there have been doomsayers who see
the imminent end of civilization. For example, in the mid-1800s, the
British began to worry about running out of coal. Writes Simon: ``The great
English economist, Stanley Jevons, calculated that a shortage of coal would
bring England's industry to a standstill by 1900; he carefully assessed
that oil could never make a decisive difference.''
   Despite the power of its arguments, The State of Humanity does have some
flaws. The essays are of uneven quality--Simon's own contributions,
especially the introduction, are pointed and well-written, but some of the
other chapters are confusing and less than helpful. The book also suffers
from overkill. One grows weary of being told over and over how everything
is getting better all the time.
   Moreover, while whining about how the pessimists get more attention than
he does, Simon does not acknowledge that scaremongers are often responsible
for much of the improvement he cites. The death rate from all accidents,
for example, dropped by more than 20% over the past 10 years--thanks in no
small part to the consumer-safety advocates Simon professes to deplore.
Indeed, it may very well be that alarmism is the only way to stimulate an
effective response to large-scale problems, such as global warming and
ozone depletion, that require concerted multinational action.
   Still, The State of Humanity will become essential reading for anyone
who wants to put today's policy debates into a larger context. At a time
when politicians are locked in a bloody stalemate in Washington and many
Americans are disappointed with their lot, it's worth remembering the
progress that the human species has already made--and pondering the
potential for gains to come.

INTERNET 101 FOR BUSINESS

BY IRA SAGER

THE DIGITAL ECONOMY
Promise and Peril in the Age of Networked Intelligence
By Don Tapscott
McGraw-Hill 342pp $24.95

Surf the Net these days and you'll soon find, alongside the obscure 'zines
and hip cyber hangouts, some of the biggest names in business. Kodak,
Aetna, AT&T, Eli Lilly, IBM--each has a home page on the World Wide Web.
They and scores of other companies hope online networks can provide a
direct link to the customer and a whole new realm of electronic commerce.
   Today, however, most are sputtering along the Information Highway,
offering little more than electronic brochures. To get beyond that, argues
Don Tapscott in The Digital Economy, businesses must build fundamentally
new strategies for competing in the electronic marketplace. ``When
information becomes digital and networked, walls fall and no business is
safe,'' Tapscott writes. On the other hand, companies that understand the
Net will blossom.
   Tapscott's mission is not to tell executives how to craft I-way
strategies but to help them grasp the changes the Net will bring so they
can start planning. This isn't uncharted territory: Tapscott, a consultant
who has written often on information technology, follows countless magazine
and book writers in predicting how the computing, telecommunications, and
media industries will converge. While he points out the possibilities, he
offers few fresh insights. He cites other consultants and quotes liberally
from business publications. Also, many of the companies Tapscott hails as
pioneers--Federal Express, Wal-Mart, Levi Strauss--are already well known
for their online strategies.
   Tapscott does well weaving into one tome the business, social, and
educational implications of networks. He lays out privacy and censorship
issues, and explores the Net's potential to change the way people interact
with the government. He also raises important questions about inequality
and the need to extend the Net to a broad base of citizens. The Digital
Economy doesn't offer solutions, but it can help executives contemplating
cyberspace to ask the right questions.

`I WANT BLOOD FOR BLOOD'

By:
JAMES DRAKE

In the north Albanian village of Bluji, deep in the Dukagjin highlands,
women and children do most of the work. Grandmothers scrub laundry on the
doorsteps of stone cottages. Young wives--some heavily pregnant--lug pails
of water along the rutted cart track from the communal well. Five-year-olds
spend long days in the fields tending scrawny livestock.
   Bluji's menfolk hold antiquated notions of gender roles, but it's fear
that keeps most of them from showing their faces: This is the land of the
blood feud, a centuries-old tradition. Kept in check during the communists'
rule, it reemerged three years ago, forcing some 10,000 able-bodied
breadwinners, out of a population of 3 million, into hiding.
SHAMEFUL. ``I want blood for blood,'' spits Nasi Gjini, polishing the
pre-1914 Lee Enfield rifle that has been his constant companion since his
two sons were shot to death by a neighbor in February. The deaths followed
an exchange of drunken insults. Now, the teenage assassin, his three
brothers, and his father stay indoors, thwarting Gjini's quest for revenge.
A murderer's male kin are fair game, but gunning them down in their own
house is more shameful than the original offense. ``Here I am safe,'' says
the Gjinis' killer, peering through the bars on his window. ``But this is
no kind of life. Only Allah knows how long I'll have to stay here.'' He
spends his days smoking, sleeping, and playing cards.
   The blood feud goes back to the 12th century and was a means of meting
out summary justice. After World War II, under dictator Enver Hoxha, the
practice was suppressed, with murderers executed and their families
ostracized. But with the fall of the regime, old ways quickly returned.
   The circle of violence is taking an economic toll among the hot-tempered
subsistence farmers. When Albania opened its doors for business, some
multinationals came courting the highlanders, bringing hard currency.
Leisure giants such as Club Med talked of opening ski resorts and hiking
lodges on the country's game-packed slopes and sending whitewater rafts
down its salmon rivers.
   ``But even if they had found local partners they could trust, there
would be no guarantee those partners would be alive the next morning,''
says Adnan Rama of the Albanian Tourist Ministry. Potential investors
backed off, taking their dollars and Deutschemarks with them. Most folks
run livestock on land too poor for farming. Some make a better living
smuggling oil, weapons, liquor and cigarettes to Serbia and Bosnia. But the
average income is just $30 per month.
   The Dukagjin district has seen some 350 revenge killings since 1993, and
the problem is spreading: Hill people who migrate to the cities in search
of work take their quarrels with them. ``I'd say around 20% of our murders
this year were connected to the feuds,'' estimates Shkelqim Merdani, police
chief in Tirana, the capital.
   In a bid to stop the madness, Islamic cleric Ndrek Pjetri formed the
Missionaries of Reconciliation, a group of holy men dedicated to ending
feuds. Its members act as go-betweens, often persuading the aggrieved party
to accept cash in place of blood. The mullah has even traveled to Turkey
and Germany to settle quarrels between expatriate Albanians, and in 1994,
he successfully petitioned the U.S. Embassy in Tirana to cancel a visa
granted to a man bound for New York to carry out a killing.
   For many here, honor means more than anything. Last year, on his 16th
birthday, a boy traveled to nearby Kopliku to avenge the killing of his
grandfather 40 years ago by a brutal police captain. Reaching Kopliku, he
found the killer had died. So he called out the captain's cousin, bade him
greet the grandfather, and dispatched him with a single bullet, thereby
removing a stain on his family's honor. The boy himself was killed before
he turned 17.
   The 68-year-old Pjetri claims to have resolved more than 170 disputes,
but new ones crop up too fast for the pack mules he uses to travel to
isolated villages. By the time he arrives, another murder may have taken
place. So he has applied for a government grant to buy a four-wheel-drive
vehicle. ``They say there isn't money,'' he says. ``I've told them they
should see it as an investment.''

IT'S FOR YOU--ON THE PC
Voice calling via the Internet is here and it's cheap-but don't toss your
phone yet

By:
BY JOHN W. VERITY

There's little, it seems, that the Internet doesn't provide: low-cost
electronic publishing, global E-mail delivery, instant access to every kind
of digital information and service. Now, it's promising ``free'' phone
calls between any two Net computers, more or less, and for no more money
than the usual connection fee.
   As it turns out, this is another one of those Internet concepts that
seem to offer exciting potential if not high-quality results just yet. It's
sort of like the idea of finding whatever information you need on the Net.
Sure, its computers are crammed with information, but as all Web surfers
soon discover, much of it is trivial.
MEETING PLACE. Likewise, the Internet can transmit speech cheaply, but not
in a satisfying or easy way. Right now, an Internet voice call has little
of the tone or intimacy of a regular phone call. It's more like talking
over CB radio. Still, it costs little to try, and when they work well,
Internet voice calls can be entertaining and useful. Besides saving money
on long-distance communications--even across oceans--Internet phoning can
enhance computer games. Eventually, phoning via the Internet may serve as
an inexpensive method for training and conference calls.
   How to get started? First, you'll need basic Internet knowhow and some
patience. For hardware, you'll need a Windows-compatible computer with a
50-megahertz 486 processor, a sound card, a speaker, and a microphone.
(Most Internet phone-software packages work only with Microsoft Corp.'s
Windows, but there are programs available for Apple Computer Inc.'s
Macintoshes and for Unix computers.) A 28.8-kilobits-per-second modem is
best, though some packages can work with 14.4-kbs models. Also required is
a SLIP/PPP connection to the Internet.
   There's already a choice of software. Trial versions are available at no
charge directly from the Web sites of several suppliers (table). Even in
compressed form, these lengthy programs can take 15 minutes or more to
download into your machine. Also, each is programmed to work only for a
limited time. VocalTec Inc.'s Internet Phone allows just 60 seconds of
calling time, for instance. You're free to take more than one copy--or pay
$49.95 for a limitless version. Internet Telephone Co.'s WebPhone program,
which was available free prior to Jan. 1, 1996, now costs $49.95.
   Each program does essentially the same thing--make your PC's sound card
convert the microphone's analog signals into a string of digital packets of
data that move separately across the Net like envelopes in a postal system.
Depending on the Net's traffic conditions at any given moment, consecutive
packets may take different routes through the Net and arrive out of order.
At the receiving end, telephony software will try to compensate, but it's
often impossible for the program to reconstruct the original signal
completely.
   None of this software is simple to install or use. There are numerous
network and computer parameters to set, and you'll need to plug in
specifics about your Internet addressing, for instance. It took me and a
friend more than an hour to get VocalTec's package to work. For WebPhone, I
sought the supplier's assistance.
TOUGH TALK. Once we had the software installed, we found out just how
different from conventional telephone calling Internet phone setups are.
The sound is choppy, syllables drop out of words, and it can take several
seconds for voices to traverse the Net. Each party must take turns
speaking--and they must be using the same brand of software. You must
either arrange a time to converse or scan your supplier's online directory
to find others around the world who are online and looking for
conversation. Directories often list people's preferred topics of
conversation, which range from the personal to lofty technical matters.
   Which software to choose? As the first to market, VocalTec's package has
become the most popular. Internet Telephone's WebPhone looks the best--like
a futuristic telephone with lots of point-and-click buttons. Quarterdeck
Corp. plans to enhance its WebTalk with a variety of multimedia tools to
help people collaborate over the Internet. You can keep up with the
technology's rapid evolution by seeing what enthusiasts post to the
independently run Voice on the Net E-mail list: Send the message,
``subscribe von-digest,'' to majordomo@pulver.com.
   For now, Internet telephony reminds me of the dancing elephant in a
circus: One is more impressed that it can dance at all than with the dance
itself. But at this stage, teaching the Internet new dances is really what
it's all about.

WHY IS THE U.S. SETTLING FOR STUNTED GROWTH?

By:
BY PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS

Economic growth has fallen on hard times. The budget struggle between
Congress and the Clinton Administration has been partly over whether the
economy will grow 2.3% annually or 2.5%. Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Alan Greenspan has hinted that even this slow growth might not be possible
without a balanced budget.
   It was not always so. In the postwar era, growth was a liberal mantra.
Not even inflation-shy Republican Administrations could withstand its
imperative. The Ford Administration, for example, forecast a growth rate of
5.98% in average annual real gross national product for the 1976-80 period.
The Carter Administration brought us into the 1980s with a 4.7% average
annual real GNP growth projection for 1979-83.
   The attitude toward growth changed remarkably in 1981, when the Reagan
Administration forecast a 3.8% annual rate of real GNP growth from 1981 to
1985. The forecast was paltry compared with those for earlier periods and
was no higher than what the economy achieved from 1976 to 1980. But the
hyperbole flew fast. Reagan's forecast was denounced as a ``rosy scenario''
that ``lies far beyond the limits of any past experience in this country or
any other industrial democracy'' (The Washington Post, Mar. 9, 1981).
COOLED PASSION. What happened in such a short time span to make modest
economic-growth projections unwelcome? Environmental hysteria connecting
growth with pollution took a toll, as did the rising inflation that had
accompanied growth in the 1970s. But among macroeconomists themselves, the
cooled passion for growth may have reflected the change in the way it was
being pursued.
   In the postwar era, prosperity-peddling Keynesians connected economic
growth with the growth of government. True, in the Keynesian model, a tax
cut that increased the deficit would raise aggregate demand and economic
growth, but the tax cut multiplier was less than the government-spending
multiplier. That is, if economic growth was the goal, more government
spending was the efficient way to achieve it. Keynesian economics was a
political success because it merged economic growth with liberal compassion
and the propensity of politicians to build spending constituencies.
Moreover, the Keynesian model relied on a proactive government to manage
aggregate demand and produce full employment. Policymakers found this to be
a more gratifying approach than laissez-faire.
   Reagan's growth program was unpopular with macroeconomists because it
was not premised on the growth of government. Indeed, Reagan wanted to
curtail the growth of government, while increasing economic incentives to
individuals. This cut to the emotional core, and liberals who couldn't get
enough ``Keynesian'' growth were horrified at the prospect of
``supply-side'' growth.
   For many, supply-side economics has an even worse strike against it. It
maintains that fiscal policy works not by increasing aggregate demand, but
by raising aftertax rewards for work and investment. Supply-side economics
not only tolerates market-based income differences--it also links tax
policy with productivity growth and shows the high cost of using taxes to
level incomes.
   Liberal economists have responded not by resurrecting Keynesian demand
management--an impossible task--but by deemphasizing growth. One way of
doing this is to argue that regardless of policy, the economy cannot grow
any faster than its long-term average of 2.5% annually. Liberals then
narrowly limit economics to ``fairness'' issues. For example, Paul R.
Krugman, an economist at Stanford University, says that with a long-term
growth potential of 2.5%, it is pointless to increase incentives when the
only effect is more economic inequality.
   A downsizing of growth ambitions requires harsher cutbacks in welfare
and entitlements in order to contain the deficit or balance the budget. It
also means that policymakers cannot rely on income growth to compensate for
the slower growth in government programs or on job growth to absorb the
inflow of legal and illegal immigrants. The social and political
implications of slow growth may well prove more unpalatable than
``greed.''
   From 1982 to 1989, the U.S. economy grew at an average annual rate of
3.7%. The new ``2.5% inevitable growth school'' may argue either that these
seven years of above-inevitable growth occurred at the expense of future
growth or compensated for below-inevitable growth in the past. But the fact
remains that people experienced 3.7%, not the long-run average. The
electorate liked it, and the Washington policymakers who took it away are
history.

FED FEAR OF THE JOBLESS RATE
It may be a faulty inflation signal


By:
BY GENE KORETZ

Though they welcome the Federal Reserve's latest cut in short-term interest
rates, economists Mickey D. Levy of NationsBanc Capital Markets Inc. and
Joseph Carson of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. both believe that Fed policy
remains far too restrictive in the face of growing economic weakness. As
they see it, the largest roadblock to a substantial easing of monetary
policy may well be the Fed's unjustified concern regarding the low
unemployment rate.
   Fed officials, says Levy, tend to believe in a so-called natural rate of
unemployment--that is, a rate at which labor markets are so tight that
further declines would spark rising inflation. Though estimates of that
rate have varied from 4% in the 1960s to 6.5% in the 1970s, the current
level is presumed to be just below 6%--placing November's 5.6% jobless rate
in the danger zone.
   Levy argues, however, that productivity progress by U.S. business
combined with the Fed's enhanced inflation-fighting credibility have
effectively lowered the natural rate of unemployment well below the
5.5%-to-6% range. By reaping productivity gains from restructuring and more
flexible use of labor (including contingent workers), as well as from
increased investment in technology, says Levy, business has improved its
resiliency in labor markets and boosted its leverage in wage bargaining.
   Meanwhile, growing job insecurity has made employees more docile. And
the Fed's tough anti-inflation stance has curbed employers' ability to pay
for wage hikes by raising prices. All of which, says Levy, suggests that
today's 5.6% jobless rate is far from a danger signal of impending
inflation.
   For his part, Carson notes that the meager 607,000 rise in employment
over the past 12 months (as measured by the Labor Dept.'s survey of
households) was matched by unusually sluggish labor force growth of just
724,000 people. This is only half of the 1.1% growth in the labor force in
1994 (chart), which was right in line with Labor Dept. projections.
   Carson attributes this sharp drop in labor force growth to declines in
labor force participation by 20-to-24-year-old and 55-to-64-year-old males.
He speculates that poor job prospects in 1995 inspired more young workers
to stay in school, while continued downsizing eroded the ranks of older
workers. In any case, he says, ``the thing to remember is that the
unemployment rate would be a half a percentage point higher if the labor
force had expanded at its trend rate.''
   Either Levy's or Carson's analysis may explain why inflation has stayed
so low with 5.6% unemployment. If, as seems likely, they are both right,
the Fed has more than ample room to ease aggressively in the months ahead.

WHAT'S STALLING MONETARY UNION
Europe's economies are out of sync


By:
BY GENE KORETZ

At first blush, the wave of European interest-rate cuts touched off by the
Bundesbank's latest move would seem to suggest that economic convergence is
growing. Christopher Widness of Chemical Securities Inc. points out,
however, that despite the synchronous rate cuts, the differences between
inflation rates (and interest rates) have actually widened. A year ago, for
example, French inflation was nearly a percentage point lower than German
inflation. Today it is higher. And the gaps between German inflation and
inflation in Spain and Italy have grown (chart).
   The irony, says Widness, is that in many countries, such as Italy and
Spain, fiscal restraint could boost inflation as sales tax hikes feed into
the price indexes and inspire wage pressures. And that spells increased
political strains that could short-circuit progress toward economic
convergence and monetary union.

A MILESTONE FOR BLACK FAMILIES
Fewer out-of-wedlock births

By:
BY GENE KORETZ

As reported by The Numbers News newsletter, black families in America have
made significant progress in at least one key area in recent years:
Birthrates among unmarried black women--including teenagers--declined in
1993 for the fourth year in a row. The birthrate fell from 90.7 per 1,000
unmarried black women age 15 to 44 in 1989 to 84.0 in 1993. By contrast,
the birthrate among unmarried white women, though far below that of blacks,
continues to rise sharply--from 30.2 in 1989 to 35.9 in 1993.

WHEN LAWYERS ARE LOOKERS
Attractiveness boosts earnings

By:
BY GENE KORETZ

Other things being equal, better-looking lawyers make more money than their
unattractive colleagues. That's the implication of a new study that looks
at how law school graduates of the 1970s fared in labor markets in
subsequent years. In the study, economists Jeff E. Biddle of Michigan State
University and Daniel S. Hamermesh of the University of Texas developed
attractiveness ratings based on class photos of students of a top law
school and then used survey data to gauge their career progress five and 15
years after graduation.
   The results indicated that attractive male attorneys (there were few
women in the group studied) made more money than plain or homely attorneys
after five years of practice, and the gap widened over time. Further, more
of the attractive group tended to become litigators, a specialty where good
looks are a likely asset, and to work in the higher-paying private sector,
where client relationships have a larger effect on earnings.
   Interestingly enough, the researchers found little payoff to
attractiveness among law school graduates of the 1980s. And while good
looks boosted the chances of males grads of both the 1970s and 1980s being
offered a law firm partnership after only five years of practice, they
actually lowered the chances of early partnership for young female
lawyers.

YOU MADE THE CALL

By:
EDITED BY LARRY LIGHT, WITH PAUL ENG

THE THIRD ANNUAL UP FRONT Reader Survey is gleaned from 288 responses to
our questionnaire, almost half via E-mail. It shows a sober group that's
cautiously optimistic and doesn't expect miracles.
   We asked about job security for the second year in a row. And the
answers were pretty close to last year's. In a time of corporate
downsizing, the share of those feeling less secure at work rose slightly,
from 32% to 36%, while people who are more secure was virtually unchanged.
Yet, despite all the gloom and doom we hear about how too few are saving
enough for old age, two-thirds project their old-age standard of living to
remain as is or get better.
   About the stock market, the consensus is for continued good times, with
an average prediction of 5754 for the Dow's 1996 high. Most
prognostications clustered in the 5251-6000 range. There's no consensus on
a favorite stock, though, with names scattered all over. The No.1 pick is a
tie between Microsoft and Intel, with 14 responses each.
   On matters not affecting them directly, namely the federal budget,
readers go for the conventional wisdom. Most name 2002 as the best target
date to balance the budget. Newt Gingrich wants to do the deed by then.
Now, so does Bill Clinton. There's a tempered optimism on the much
ballyhooed Information Highway. While a majority sees the Infobahn as the
driving force of tomorrow's economy, skeptics abound: To more than 40%,
it's just hype.

A FEW NEW BLOTS ON THE LEDGER
Delinquent consumer loans and skinny margins may temper an otherwise bully
year

By:
By Kelley Holland in New York, with Amy Barrett in Washington


It was beginning to look as if the good times would never end for U.S.
banks. Since 1991, profits have set record after record, asset quality has
sharply improved, and bank stocks have seemed headed for the moon. But now,
a few clouds are dotting the horizon. Consumers are beginning to have
trouble with heavy debt burdens. And the narrow gap between short- and
long-term rates bodes ill for banks' profit margins on loans and
investments. Although Merrill Lynch & Co. predicts that profits for 56 top
banks should grow 9.8% in 1996 (chart), pan in for a closeup and the
picture is murkier.
   The biggest potential problem is related to the ongoing growth in
lending. Consumer installment credit grew roughly 14% in 1995, according to
DRI/McGraw-Hill. While banks profit initially by providing that credit,
heavy consumer debt burdens mean more loan delinquencies down the road.
Indeed, the American Bankers Assn. says that late payments on bank-card
accounts have risen for four quarters in a row and are currently at their
second-highest level in 10 years. ``Consumer credit quality is, I think, a
very big short-term issue, potentially a big minefield,'' says Judah
Kraushaar, a banking analyst at Merrill Lynch.
HARD TO FUDGE. Corporate lending is also expanding rapidly, raising
additional concerns about loan quality in 1996. James B. Lee, vice-chairman
at Chemical Banking Corp., the top bank in loan syndications, says
corporate lending will increase through 1996, but ``certain [industry]
sectors will continue to deteriorate.'' That will prompt some borrowers to
fall behind on payments or default. Lee says lending standards are far
higher than they were in the late 1980s. However, the intense competition
to make many loans suggests that some banks are willing to offer loan terms
that leave little room for error.
   Then there is the problem of profit margins. Today, there's less than
one percentage point between the short-term rates at which banks borrow and
the longer-term rates at which they typically lend. That means room for
profits is scarce. A 1995 study by Merrill Lynch shows that bank stocks
have been poor performers nearly every year following periods when short-
and long-term interest rates are close together. ``This is a hard yield
curve to work with,'' says Jeffrey C. Keil, president of Republic New York
Corp.
   Luckily, banks still have plenty of wind at their backs. While loan
delinquencies are rising, they are still relatively scarce, and banks need
to use only small portions of their earnings as reserves for bad credits.
Moreover, new businesses are expanding for some of the biggest banks. At
J.P. Morgan & Co., Thomas B. Ketchum, head of investment banking for the
Americas, expects corporate-finance fees for services such as advising on
mergers to increase 40% in 1996.
   Expect many banks to be intensely cost-conscious in the coming year.
Bank mergers will likely continue at gale force: Gerard Smith, managing
director in the financial institutions group of UBS Securities Inc.,
predicts that by 2000, the top 50 banks will control 80% of the assets in
the U.S. banking industry, up from 56% today. And many deals will be
predicated on massive cost savings.
REFORM DELAY. Spending on technology will grow in 1996. Most bankers, eager
to see their customers reduce their use of high-cost branches and step up
use of electronic banking outlets, are placing large bets on systems for
banking by phone or personal computer. Edward E. Crutchfield Jr., chairman
and CEO of First Union Corp. and one of the country's most acquisitive
bankers, plans to stop buying banks for five years while he invests in
electronic retail banking. ``As soon as we really do have a choice for the
customer to make that's realistic, then he will move away from branches,''
he says.
   Changes will be harder to come by on the regulatory front. Banks have
been stymied on the big revisions they sought in 1995, such as an end to
the barriers between commercial and investment banking, and they could well
be frustrated again. Banks and insurance agents need to agree on provisions
to limit the forays of banks into the insurance business before such
banking law reform can move forward.
   Having waited this long for deregulation, bank executives aren't holding
their breath. However, for those who keep a sharp eye on operations, pay
close attention to the creditworthiness of borrowers, and plan for
electronic banking, 1996 could be a very good year indeed.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- The financial condition of banks is excellent and leaves them well
prepared to weather any economic slowdown.
   -- Managed properly, the ongoing consolidation in the industry will make
it more efficient.

Negatives
   -- Consumers have been loading up on debt, and consumer loan
delinquencies are rising.
   -- Profit margins on consumer and corporate loans could decline, hurting
bank earnings.

JOHN DEWEY, MEET PETER DRUCKER

By:
By Paul Magnusson in Washington


Your revenues are rising, but not as fast as the cost of serving customers.
Labor costs are climbing, but antiquated work rules and poor morale limit
your flexibility. Your overseas competitors pay more, spend lavishly on
training, and get far better results. Your physical plant is crumbling.
Computers are scarce. And your customers are dissatisfied.
   Welcome to America's public school system. Its problems are so profound
and its disorganization so pervasive that it would be a challenge to the
savviest of America's business managers. Just for starters: There is no
central management--only 16,000 local school districts run by amateur
boards pursuing their own agendas: football, creationism, condom
distribution.
   The school-board situation isn't going to change anytime soon, since
local control is considered an inalienable right in America. But some help
for what ails the schools is on the way, thanks to contemporary management
theory. Two related movements--toward school choice and school
standards--have far more to do with Peter F. Drucker than with John Dewey.
SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST. School-choice advocates hope to foster competition
among schools. That way, the weakest schools will lose students and either
improve or fold. The strongest schools will prosper and expand. One plan
would offer vouchers for purchasing education from existing private and
public schools. Vouchers are strongly opposed by teachers' unions and the
Clinton Administration. They argue that some kids will be left in bad
schools and some schools will use the wrong lures--such as lavish spending
on sports. Still, Republicans will give school choice a boost if their
numbers increase in state legislatures this year.
   Other reformers favor charter schools that contract to provide education
to willing public-school students. Often operating out of storefronts or
underused public buildings and free of bureaucracy, charter schools are
generally cost-effective. These schools must demonstrate results or lose
their charters. There are some 245 of them in 19 states. ``This is just
applying America's entrepreneurial spirit to the school,'' says Joseph
Nathan, director of the Center for School Change, a research group in
Minnesota that is tracking the trend.
   Curriculum reform based on setting universal standards of knowledge is
progressing much faster. It is based on sound business principles: First
you decide what students should learn, and then you hold teachers and
administrators accountable. ``In states where they take standards
seriously, they have seemed to make a difference,'' says Marc Tucker,
president of the National Center on Education and the Economy, which helps
schools in the standards effort. Critics complain that teachers will
concentrate on drilling students to pass tests instead of pursuing broader
educational objectives. Still, parents seem to like the results. In their
second year of a standards-based curriculum, Maryland students boosted
their scores by 25%.
   Pressure for schools to become more efficient is intense. Immigration is
swelling enrollments. The number of students with limited proficiency in
English jumped by 26% during the 1980s. And children who require special
education increased by 15% over the past decade. ``We've got a whole influx
of kids who have been exposed to alcohol and drugs, hurt by environmental
contaminants, or diagnosed with learning difficulties,'' says Kathy
Christie, a Denver-area school board member and an analyst at the Education
Commission of the States.
FALLING BEHIND. All this is happening as an unpaid bill for neglect of
school buildings is coming due. One-third of America's schools, serving
some 14 million students, require extensive repair or replacement,
according to a 1995 report by the General Accounting Office. A quarter of
all public schools lack sufficient computers, and 42% have inadequate
science laboratories, says the GAO.
   That is a lot for local school boards to deal with. Without a clear
focus on educational goals, they tend to ``pay too much attention to
asbestos and not enough to training teachers and developing curriculum,''
says Bruce Alberts, president of the National Academy of Sciences. American
science scholarship in grade school is falling behind because much of the
industrialized world pays ``enormously more attention to teacher refresher
courses and to professional development,'' says Alberts.
   America's management gurus may not have the whole solution. But the
notion that schools must measure and improve their output--graduates who
can read and do math--can only help.

INDUSTRY OUTLOOK

By:
By Mike McNamee in Washington, with Richard A. Melcher in Chicago,
Elisabeth Malkin in Mexico City, Wendy Zellner in Dallas, and bureau
reports


On medieval maps, the terra incognita around the borders was festooned with
whirlpools, dragons, and dire warnings: ``Here there be monsters!'' In
1996, as the U.S. economy sails into uncharted waters, its map might well
be decorated with cherubs and zephyrs. Refreshed after 1995's slowdown and
wafted along by falling interest rates, American business should glide into
1996, leaving in its wake steady if not sparkling growth through the sixth
year of expansion.
   Favorable portents abound. Congress and the White House seem certain to
deliver a plan to whack hundreds of billions out of federal deficits over
the last half of the '90s. Even with the budget unresolved, the Federal
Reserve cut short-term interest rates on Dec. 19 from 5.75% to 5.5%--the
first of three 25-basis-point cuts that Fed-watchers expect by the end of
1996. That's welcome news: ``We'll see growth in '96, but I think we'll see
more of it if the Fed keeps lowering rates,'' says Ross J. Centanni,
president of air-compressor maker Gardner Denver Machinery Inc.
   Coupled with continued low inflation, the Fed's easing will ratify the
remarkable rally in bond prices, keeping crucial long-term rates down. That
will provide a lift to housing and commercial real estate. And America's
top trading partners should struggle out of their 1995 doldrums and buy
more from U.S. manufacturers.
SCROOGES GALORE. That's not to say that business will sail effortlessly
through the year. The 23 industries profiled by BUSINESS WEEK in this
year's Industry Outlook will need skillful navigation to steer through
shifting currents. The sectors that will lead the way through 1996 will
either enjoy continuing strong demand--such as semiconductor makers or Wall
Street's securities houses--or, like defense manufacturers, will continue
to squeeze more profits out of shrinking sales.
   Laggards will find themselves on the wrong side of 1996's negative
trends: slower growth in capital spending, pressure on pricing, and
tight-fisted consumers. After a three-year modernization binge with
12%-plus growth rates in capital spending, investment in producers' durable
equipment will rise only 6% in 1996, after adjustment for inflation. Even
computer makers will lose some altitude, with inflation-adjusted sales
rising 18% in 1996, vs. 27.1% growth in 1995, according to forecasts by
DRI/McGraw-Hill.
   The '90s efficiency boom will spell trouble for any producer trying to
raise prices in 1996. In a BUSINESS WEEK/Harris Executive Poll in December
(page 76), only 40% of the executives surveyed predict they will raise
prices in 1996, down from the 63% who were confident of price hikes before
1995 began. ``We're in a buyer's market,'' says Bradford W. Hildebrandt, a
management consultant to law firms. And carmakers, restaurateurs,
retailers, and other businesses catering to consumers will find they're
dealing with wary customers, thanks to debt burdens that have hit a record
19% of disposable income. ``Debt is putting a lot of pressure on
households, particularly the under-$50,000 families'' who are the core of
the mass market, says economist Mark M. Zandi of forecasters Regional
Financial Associates.
   But even careful consumers will spend enough to keep the economy
growing. Jobs and income will keep rising, and inflation will stay low,
with consumer prices up about 2.9%. That will help keep long-term interest
rates near their low 1995 levels, with yields on the 30-year Treasury bond
averaging 6.3% for 1996. All told, BUSINESS WEEK expects the economy to
turn in a better performance in 1996 than 1995: The gross domestic product
will grow about 2.3%, after inflation, from the fourth quarter of 1995 to
the end of 1996. That's up from the 2% expected when the books are closed
on 1995 (charts, pages 74, 74A).
   That 2.3% growth may not sound like much, but, remember, the scale for
measuring the economy is changing. The Commerce Dept. is adjusting the way
it calculates growth in GDP--in particular, how much of growth represents a
real increase in output vs. how much results from inflation. The old system
tended to overemphasize growth in surging industries with falling prices,
primarily computers, thus ballooning the economy's overall growth rate.
   The new ``chain-weighted'' measures will reflect price changes more
quickly, resulting in less exaggeration of fast-growing sectors. So while
the old scale measured GDP growing at a respectable 2.8% in 1995, the
Commerce Dept. will probably report a 2% gain by the new measures--forcing
business and economists to recalibrate notions of what constitutes a
``weak'' or ``strong'' economy. BUSINESS WEEK uses the chain-weighted
system in this report.
GROWING SEASON. However you measure it, the 1996 economy will feature some
familiar trends, such as downsizing. Outplacement specialists Challenger
Gray & Christmas Inc. predict that corporate layoffs will total 420,000 in
1996, matching 1995's level. Payroll-shedding will be most common in
industries where the government's role, either as a purchaser or a
regulator, is shrinking: defense, aerospace, telecommunications, banking,
and utilities.
   Slash-and-burn alone, however, will no longer dominate strategy
sessions. ``Very few companies have created sustainable advantages through
shrinking,'' says Thomas J. Tierney, managing director of consultants Bain
& Co. More companies say they're focusing on growth strategies designed to
increase sales, boost market share, and expand overseas. In a September
survey of senior planning executives at 100 large U.S. corporations, 73%
said that boosting revenues would be more important than cutting costs over
the next three years, according to the Futures Group Inc., strategic
planning consultants. Only 18% of the executives surveyed emphasized
belt-tightening.
   One of the fastest routes to growth is acquisition. The 1995 merger boom
will keep rolling--whether it's telephone and media giants scrambling for
stronger positions in explosive communications markets or doctors banding
together for clout to deal with insurers. Defense contractors, electric
utilities, drugmakers, and banks are all feeling the heat. ``People realize
they need scale to compete--and it's easier to buy than to build,'' says
mergers and acquisitions expert Kim Fennebresque, managing director of
Union Bank of Switzerland. ``If you have scale, you can reduce costs.''
   Take Union Pacific Corp., awaiting government approval for its $3.9
billion purchase of Southern Pacific Rail Corp. Ronald J. Burns, CEO of
Union Pacific Railroad Co., figures the combined lines will reap nearly
$700 million a year in cost savings and increased revenues when the deal is
digested. With economies like that within reach, Securities Data Co.
expects 1996's M&A activity to top the record $442 billion in 1995 deals
reported as of Dec. 18.
   Internal investment will remain heavy, too. For some industries, even a
three-year boom in capital spending hasn't satisfied the need for more
production capacity: Semiconductor makers are scrambling to build enough
clean rooms to keep up with 20%-plus growth in chip demand. Even sectors
with plenty of new facilities must upgrade for global competition. ``When
you're in a harsh, competitive environment, you can't stop modernizing,''
says Roger E. Brinner, DRI chief economist. Pharmaceutical firms, which
boosted research spending by a relatively low 8% in 1995, plan to beef up
budgets in search of blockbuster drugs.
   Steel is an example of the modernization drive. Despite 1995's collapse
in prices, steelmakers are rushing to build minimills. While each new
minimill wreaks havoc on existing producers, cheaper production gives steel
an edge over other materials: Builders, for example, are using more steel
and less concrete. ``People say steel demand is inelastic,'' says Nucor
Corp. Chairman F. Kenneth Iverson. ``But when you drop the price, you
expand the market.''
   Many industries will be looking abroad to expand their markets in 1996.
``We're not planning on the U.S. economy to carry us in 1996,'' says Daniel
J. Meyer, CEO of Cincinnati Milacron Inc. Outfits such as Milacron looking
to expand sales abroad can count two strong pluses in 1996: American
industry is now ranked the world's most competitive, according to the
Swiss-based World Economic Forum. And America's top trading partners, after
a poor-to-disastrous 1995, see better economies ahead.
   The biggest surprise may be Japan. After a 33% surge in the Nikkei stock
index, coupled with the Bank of Japan's success at stabilizing the yen at
around 100 to the dollar, Tokyo pundits are hopeful that economic
stagnation will finally end after four flat years. Forecasters expect
Japan's GDP to grow by 1.2% or more in 1996, after inflation.
   That growth should open up possibilities for U.S. exporters. American
brands are increasingly popular in Tokyo's Ginza, where Gap Inc. recently
opened a store to push its low-key apparel. U.S. computer makers hold about
30% of Japan's $9 billion PC market, with Compaq Computer Corp. and IBM
expecting to reap even more sales from the recent rollout of a Japanese
version of Windows 95. Even American carmakers are pushing at the gates in
hopes of capitalizing on last summer's U.S.-Japan trade deal: Ford Motor
Co. and Chrysler Corp. unveiled right-hand-drive models of the Taurus and
Neon at this fall's Tokyo auto show.
RECOVERING PESO. The other sick economy of 1995--Mexico--will also show
signs of health. Following last winter's peso crisis, the Mexican economy
has shrunk by at least 7%. U.S. exports to Mexico fell by 9% in 1995, while
the cheap peso powered a sharp 30% rise in Mexican sales to El Norte. Now,
Mexico seems set for a slow recovery, with 1.5% to 2% growth in 1996
followed by 4% or more in 1997. That won't ignite a boom in U.S. export
sales, but pressure on the trade imbalance could ease if the peso gains
strength against the dollar.
   U.S. companies account for the bulk of the $6.3 billion in direct
investments in Mexico pledged for 1996. AT&T, MCI Communications, and Bell
Atlantic are spending heavily to prepare for the 1997 opening of
telecommunications. Privatization will spread to petrochemical plants and
railroads in 1996, and Mexico is encouraging foreigners to invest in
natural-gas distribution and power plants. U.S. corporations increasingly
see Mexico as an attractive production base for sales to the rest of Latin
America. ``We can tie together manufacturing in the U.S. and Mexico and go
after markets in South America,'' says Kenneth C. Brown, president of GE de
Mexico.
   Forecasters don't expect much help with the trade balance from Canada's
rebounding economy, which the Bank of Montreal predicts will grow 3.5% in
1996. With the weak Canadian dollar (trading at around U.S. 73 cents) and
with shaky Canadian consumers holding on to their wallets, Canada's
southbound exports may grow faster than the flow of goods northward. That
could push Canada's merchandise trade surplus with the U.S. to a record $27
billion in 1996, says Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Toronto brokerage
Nesbitt Burns.
   Europe may not do much for the U.S. trade balance in 1996, either. While
members of the European Union recently unveiled their proposed unified
currency, the Euro, the recent French strikes to protest budget-cutting in
Paris highlight the difficulty that EU members will have in meeting the
stringent fiscal requirements for monetary union. French forecasters expect
growth of only 1% in 1996. Germany is healthier, but business there is
struggling to remain competitive in the face of high wages and taxes.
``Europe still has the pain and agony of downsizing and restructuring ahead
of it,'' says Nariman Behravesh, DRI's chief international economist, who
predicts 2.3% growth for the EU in 1996.
   For fast growth, U.S. exporters will once again have to turn to Asia.
The economies of China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan,
and Thailand will grow at rates between 5% and 9% in 1996, down just
slightly from 1995. Texas Instruments Inc., for instance, has an Asian
export winner in its high-end digital-signal processing chips, made in
America and sold for use in interactive toys, telecom gear, and video
devices. TI's Asian sales rose 50% in 1996, says Victor Koh, managing
director for Hong Kong and China, in part because Asians are buying more
electronics for their own use. ``We're benefiting from the higher affluence
in Asia,'' he says.
   Global crosscurrents will make 1996 the third strong year for American
exports, which should grow a further 9% after adjustment for inflation. At
the same time, subdued U.S. consumers may cut down on their purchases of
goods made abroad. So while the U.S. will still run a trade deficit, the
improved trade balance should add some $18 billion to GDP in 1996, says
Allen Sinai, chief economist at Lehman Brothers Inc., marking ``the first
time this decade that net exports have been a plus for U.S. growth rather
than a drag.''
BETTER THINGS TO DO. Export gains, continued capital spending, low
inflation, and falling interest rates--what could go wrong with this
picture? The biggest threat to the serene economy of 1996 may lie in
Washington. In their struggle over balancing the budget, President Clinton
and congressional Republicans have already shut down major portions of the
federal government twice and spooked the markets.
   Still, neither the White House nor Capitol Hill has much to gain from a
budget stalemate. For both sides, the best course is to strike a deal and
move on to matters closer to politicians' hearts--such as campaigning for
November's elections. If Washington's dragons and sea serpents will just
get out of the way, the U.S. economy could enjoy fair winds in 1996.

TEA LEAVES, ANYONE?

By:
EDITED BY LARRY LIGHT, WITH PAUL ENG

Once again, Up Front bravely predicts the future. We undertake this
foolhardy venture on the basis of what we know about the past. That often
can lead one astray, but it's the best we've got.
THE '96 ELECTION. It's Bill Clinton, the Comeback Kid, for four more years.
Vilified for much of his first term, he still will outshine his dour GOP
challenger, Bob Dole. Right-wing Republicans, uneasy about deal-cutter
Dole, will stay home. Ross Perot will mount a third-party foray and skim
off more GOP voters. Public dismay over Gingrichian harshness will give the
Dems back the House but not the Senate.
STOCK MARKET. Funny thing how the economy and the market usually go up in
an election year. Aided by lowering interest rates and ebbing inflation,
the Dow should rise moderately, to 5600, by Election Day. Nothing like
1995's performance, however, since that's hard to top.
INTEREST RATES. An eventual federal budget accord--neither party wants to
be accused of gridlock--should give the Federal Reserve all the ammo it
needs to lower rates some more. Look for the Fed, satisfied that inflation
is under control, to reduce the federal-funds rate by a half-point, to 5%,
by spring. Then it will lay off, so as not to get tangled up in electoral
politics.
MONETARY UNION. The much heralded European Monetary Union will be shelved
during a summit this summer. Other than Germany, no European country is
close to hitting fiscal targets set up by the Maastricht Treaty for a
single currency. These require cutting budget deficits and debt by 1997. As
the strikes in France show, the necessary austerity is not popular. Plus,
Europe's economies are weakening, which will make achieving the treaty's
goals even harder.
APPLE. Woebegone Apple Computer will sell off chunks of its business, since
no buyer wants the whole thing. Look for Oracle's Larry Ellison, Sun
Microsystems, or IBM to acquire software. Japan's Canon could be a buyer
for the hardware.
DISNEY. Mickey's run of smash animated films will end with this summer's
release of The Hunchback of Notre Dame. While not a bust, this flick will
do nowhere near the box office of The Lion King blockbuster or even the
moderate hit Pocahontas. In a bid to lure boys and teens, Disney chose
Quasimodo's unlovely tale. This downbeat story, though, will turn off
traditional Disney fans. Plus, the movie has few of the soaring musical
numbers that punctuated earlier efforts.
CHRYSLER. A nasty proxy fight erupts as Kirk Kerkorian challenges Chrysler.
His goal is to name his lieutenant Jerome York to the board, launch a huge
stock buyback, and double the dividend. Result: CEO Robert Eaton fends off
the billionaire. Eaton shunts some of the company's $6.4 billion in spare
cash--which Kerkorian wanted to use for dividends and buybacks--into the
more productive pursuit of a joint venture with a foreign auto maker.
THE INTERNET. Net fever will cool off a notch or two. With scads of
companies already on the Net but profits scarce, new offerings will taper
off. Look for consolidation among the companies providing Net services.
Most likely winners: America Online, Netscape, Microsoft.

SMARTEST MOVES OF 1995

By:
EDITED BY LARRY LIGHT, WITH PAUL ENG

1. AT&T focused its energies on the booming telecom market by forging plans
to spin off its manufacturing arm and its problem-plagued computer unit
(the former NCR). The stock has soared since, wiping out all the NCR
losses.
2. Early investors in the Netscape public offering profited outrageously.
Since going public at 28 last summer, it topped 150 by early December.
3. Colin Powell adroitly managed his public persona with his book tour. By
then ruling out a Presidential bid, he avoids the mud of the 1996
primaries. So he's free to be crowned the GOP Vice-Presidential nominee.
4. Kirk Kerkorian advanced his battle to win more influence at Chrysler by
hiring its former CFO, Jerome York. York's baleful analyses of the
carmaker's finances grabbed investor attention.
5. Caterpillar hung tough and got the United Auto Workers to come back from
their 18-month strike, accepting terms they rejected at the outset.

DUMBEST MOVES OF 1995

By:
EDITED BY LARRY LIGHT, WITH PAUL ENG

1. Daiwa Bank let a U.S.-based trader run up $1.1 billion in losses. A key
regulator at Japan's Ministry of Finance knew about the mess but let it
slide.
2. Barings collapsed because it didn't know until too late that
Singapore-based trader Nick Leeson ran up $1.4 billion in losses.
3. Newt Gingrich's abrasiveness and vainglory blunted his message. Big
example: He said he favored shutting down the government in November partly
out of pique that Bill Clinton made him sit in the back of Air Force One.
4. Calvin Klein was forced to withdraw his jeans ads, which used teen
models in suggestive poses. Critics accused him of purveying kiddie porn.
5. ABC knuckled under to Philip Morris' $10 billion libel suit over a
program about cigarettes' nicotine content that contained one defensible
error.

FROM CHRISTMAS BLAHS TO NEW YEAR'S EASE

By:
BY JAMES C. COOPER & KATHLEEN MADIGAN

While Congress and the White House play their political games over the
budget, they seem oblivious to the dangers of testing the patience of the
financial markets. With so much anticipation for deficit reduction already
priced into the markets, Wall Street had better get some good news from
Washington fast, or another 102-point tumble in stock prices and a sharp
sell-off in bonds like those of Dec. 18 could be in the making.
   For now, at least, the markets have taken solace from elsewhere in
Washington: the Federal Reserve. The Fed's Dec. 19 quarter-point cut in
short-term interest rates has soothed the markets' edginess, not so much
because of that one snip but because it now looks as though more policy
easing is on the way.
   The strongest hint of that is the reason given by the Fed for its latest
cut. Chairman Alan Greenspan cited not a soft economy but inflation that
was ``somewhat more favorable than anticipated.'' More important, he noted
``an associated moderation in inflation expectations.'' The two-point drop
during the past year in long-term bond yields, which incorporate
anticipated inflation, bears that out.
   If such expectations are indeed down, the Fed cannot justify holding its
overnight federal funds rate nearly three full points above the rate of
inflation, in light of an historical average of only about 1 3/4%. What
Greenspan is saying is this: Against a more sanguine attitude toward future
inflation, real short-term rates are simply too high.
   Moreover, these expectations of lower inflation are not fleeting. They
are set to stay down amid continued modest economic growth, an eventual
budget deal, a stronger dollar, and a new order of technology-driven
competitiveness in Corporate America.

THE IMPACT of these structural forces is clear in the November consumer
price index, which was flat for the first time since the end of the last
recession in March, 1991. The core index, which excludes the volatile
energy and food sectors, rose a scant 0.1%.
   Through November, annual CPI inflation was running at 2.6%, the same as
in 1994, and it seems likely to have ended 1995 very near that pace. Back
in July, the Fed's own forecast projected that inflation for the year would
be much higher, between 3.1% and 3.4%.
   Even service inflation, widely anticipated to be the first area to
register a speedup, has remained modest, at about 3.4% for most of the
year. Meanwhile, goods inflation, at 1.5% in November, is hardly on the
radar (chart). However, that low rate is the result of deep discounting by
many retailers, which threatens their profits--and for some, their very
existence.
   Retailers' dreary little Christmas provides additional support for a
winter rate cut. Despite the expected last-minute surge, stores still
reported pretty dismal sales in December. Rampant price promotions to lure
shoppers subtracted from dollar revenues. The early winter weather in some
parts of the nation only added to the problem. The Johnson Redbook Report
said December sales at department and discount stores through Dec. 23 were
2.4% below November sales.
   Lifeless sales mean that yearend profits will be a disaster for many
retailers, and the consolidation process already wracking the industry will
accelerate. More chains, especially regional discounters and apparel
stores, are likely to seek bankruptcy protection.
   The resulting liquidations could well lead to further downward pressure
on goods prices. If so, an actual decline in the monthly CPI in any of the
coming months cannot be ruled out.
   This lack of price pressure should bolster the strong low-inflation
sentiment in the bond market. And given the Fed's statement on inflationary
expectations, low long-term rates will give the central bank even more room
for another rate cut.

DO THE RETAIL WOES mean that the economy is tanking? Not necessarily. Much
of the profits decline stemmed from price cutting, so sales on an
inflation-adjusted basis should look somewhat better. Also, consumer
confidence, while down slightly in December, remains at the level it has
held for most of 1995 (chart).
   Moreover, according to one top Fed official, the central bank is aware
that the reports from individual retailers do not match the data used to
calculate the Commerce Dept.'s retail sales figures. And those retail
numbers do not include service purchases, which have remained healthy in
recent months.
   But while consumer buying is not as dramatically weak as the dour
reports from retailers would suggest, demand will still be no better than
modest. One reason is that in early 1996 consumers will have to contend
with their holiday credit-card bills.

THE RESULT WILL BE continued pressure on industrial output and employment,
as businesses adjust their inventories to more desirable levels. That
scenario should translate into unexciting economic growth in the new
year--another reason the Fed will have room to ease policy further.
   In October, inventories held by manufacturers, wholesalers, and
retailers rose 0.6%, but sales tumbled 0.4%. During the past year, the
annual growth rates of both inventories and sales have been slowing, but
the pace of sales has slowed faster (chart).
   That disparity is the chief reason for the continued sluggishness in the
industrial sector. Industrial production in November rose a tepid 0.2%,
following a decline in October. Output for the fourth quarter is on track
to rise even more slowly than the lackluster 3.2% annual rate posted in the
third quarter.
   The international economic climate is also conducive to rate cutting.
Even before the Fed's Dec. 19 move, the British Treasury and the German
Bundesbank had trimmed rates in the face of slower economic growth. And
following the Fed, the Bank of Canada eased monetary policy as well.
   Other European central banks followed the German lead, as growth
throughout Europe appears to be slowing, leading most private forecasters
to cut their projections for 1996 European growth. Almost all
industrialized nations reported weak holiday sales.
   Consequently, the dollar should be able to maintain its recent trend of
appreciation against the German mark and the Japanese yen, even in the face
of further rate reductions by the Fed. The greenback will get some added
support when a budget deal rolls in from Washington--whenever that may take
place.
   That delay, however, will not hamstring monetary policy. In the recently
released minutes of the Fed's Nov. 15 meeting, the central bankers agreed
that the Fed ``could not freeze its policy options while it awaited the
outcome of a prolonged federal budget debate.''
   Now that Shutdown II has stretched to record length, the Fed's refusal
to be tied to the political wrangling means that economic and inflationary
forces will set the course of monetary policy in early 1996. And right now,
those forces point to further easing ahead.

A HARD-WON VICTORY IN A SOFT ECONOMY

By:
BY JAMES C. COOPER & KATHLEEN MADIGAN

After a dismal 1995, Argentina is poised for an expansionary 1996. And that
growth will pave the way for fiscal improvement and a stable currency.
   The latest sign that Argentina is coming out of recession came from the
Latin America Research Fund. The private agency reported that demand for
industrial goods rose again in November. Purchases have been increasing
since hitting a three-year low in August, with capital goods leading the
gain. In addition, in its semiannual survey the government said that the
unemployment rate slipped to 16.4% in October, from a record high of 18.4%
in May. However, only part of the drop is the result of job growth of
40,000 new slots. The rest came from workers dropping out of the labor
force.
   Argentina's economy likely fell by 2.5% in 1995, but the government is
forecasting growth of 5% in 1996. Private economists expect a more
realistic 3% advance this year. Economic growth should be fueled by lower
interest rates, a stronger peso--thanks to its link to the rising U.S.
dollar and low inflation--and inflows of foreign funds. Already, prospects
of better corporate profits have lifted the stock market in recent weeks.
   Economic growth will keep the markets rising. And it will help the
government balance the budget in 1996, after Argentina's $2.4 billion
deficit in 1995. To raise revenues, Congress hiked the cigarette tax by 7%
on Dec. 21.
   Argentina's slump was the result of an austerity program to fight
hyperinflation--a battle that has succeeded so far. Consumer prices were up
1.7% from a year ago in November (chart). Inflation is on track to rise
between 1.5% and 1.7% for 1995, the lowest rate on record. In 1989,
Argentine inflation ran at a stunning 5,000%.
   The International Monetary Fund has blessed Argentina's economic and
fiscal progress, saying it would lend Argentina $380 million this year.
That influx of funds--along with private money attracted by the rising
stock market--is added insurance that Argentina's economy will grow in
1996.

HERE COMES GRIDLOCK '96
Dug-in liberals and GOP zealots spell election-year paralysis

By:
By Richard S. Dunham, with Lee Walczak, in Washington

Citing irreconcilable differences with his Republican foes, President
Clinton vetoes appropriations bill after appropriations bill, leaving large
chunks of the government to run on fumes. A bitter budget impasse shutters
the federal bureaucracy for the longest stretch in history, forcing the
Treasury to resort to creative accounting to fund essential arms of
government. Voters increasingly dismiss the capital caterwauling as the
latest example of Washington's childishness. Actually, there's another way
to describe the capital's escalating political brawl: dress rehearsal.
   As the 1995 legislative season draws to a rancorous close with the fate
of a budget-balancing accord, welfare reform, and other key legislation
unresolved, the tone is being set for next year's policy struggles. In the
best of times, an election-year Congress can be expected to elevate
political theatrics over substance. But the ideological differences between
dug-in Democratic liberals, GOP hardliners, and a President obsessed by
reelection will ensure that next year's Congress--and any chance business
had for advancing the solid legislative gains of '95--will be stymied by
paralyzing political gamesmanship.
   Even as GOP and Administration budget negotiators warily convened for a
round of post-Christmas talks, the realization was growing that after
months of Republican dominance, Washington has once again become Gridlock
City. ``We're ready to kill each other already,'' laments a Democratic
leadership aide. ``It can't get any worse--can it?''
   Actually, it can, and it will. Bolstered by his success at using the
Medicare debate to paint Republicans as extremists, President Clinton plans
to continue his political jiu-jitsu in 1996. The new target: a GOP flat-tax
proposal that the Administration will cast as a boondoggle for wealthy
investors. Says a Clinton adviser: ``Medicare was just a dress rehearsal
for what Republicans are in for when Democrats start in on the `tax
giveaway for the rich.'''
HANGING TOUGH. If Clinton is spoiling for another fight along class lines,
he's sure to find one with a combative group of Hill conservatives who are
not letting House Speaker Newt Gingrich's plunging popularity cool their
fervor. The freshmen have hardened GOP resistance to a budget-balancing
accord and promise to make more trouble next year by redoubling attacks on
the welfare state.
   The hang-tough tactics ``haven't been marching orders from Newt
Gingrich,'' says rookie Representative Steve Largent (R-Okla.). ``We came
in here with our name on the dotted line.'' Adds freshman Representative
Zach Wamp (R-Tenn.): ``We've been called radical and extreme, but I think
we're right out of the heart of America.'' Still, business leaders worry
that the freshmen's all-or-nothing approach is overly antagonistic. ``The
war is worth fighting,'' says Amway President Dick DeVos. ``But it
shouldn't be done stupidly.''
   To appreciate just how complicated 1996's legislative equation will be,
take a short stroll across the Capitol from the foxholes of House GOP
guerrillas to the placid quarters of Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. The
Republican front-runner will pursue his own agenda--and none of it includes
riling potential voters, Gingrich-style. Dole plans a light Senate schedule
for the first three months of '96, which will give him lots of time to wrap
up the nomination. Concedes one senior House staffer: ``All we're going to
get done around here is the minimum must-pass agenda.''
   Even a minimal Hill agenda could fall victim to gridlock. Aside from
monitoring preliminary hearings on radical simplification of the tax code,
business is keenest on winning regulatory relief from nuisance lawsuits,
environmental mandates, and overeager regulators who don't weigh the
potential economic impact of new rules. The outlook for sweeping change is
even gloomier. For starters, Dems will continue to score political points
by portraying GOP reformers as too cozy with polluters and overly beholden
to corporate benefactors. And House and Senate Republican moderates will
continue to line up with Dems against GOP radicals. The bottom line for
business: little progress in '96.
   On another front of interest to business lobbyists--political
reform--bipartisan attempts to limit the role of organized giving in
political campaigns seem likely to be thwarted by the leaders of both
parties. Newly triumphant Republican leaders are shaking the corporate
money tree hard and don't want to give up their advantage. Democrats,
meanwhile, remain hooked on reforms that include taxpayer subsidies
vehemently opposed by Republicans. The prospect: Look for superficial
reforms, at best, and torrents of pious rhetoric.
DEEP BELIEFS. GOP plans to dismantle New Deal social programs by returning
responsibility to the states will face tough sledding, too. Already, GOP
moderates have quashed reformers' efforts to turn food stamps and the
school lunch program into state-run block grants. And Clinton's attack on
GOP schemes to shift Medicaid to state capitals is just a preview of a '96
Democratic assault that charges Republicans aim to shred the social safety
net. The outlook: Although Clinton may yet cut a deal on a proposal to end
the federal guarantee of open-ended welfare benefits, other GOP
``devolution'' initiatives will languish.
   At bottom, deeply held partisan beliefs frame this running debate about
the role of government. But the tactics of the combatants are disturbing
the American electorate. In December, the Harris Poll's annual ``alienation
index'' hit a 30-year high. And an Associated Press poll released on Dec.
26 found that 29% of those surveyed said neither political party addresses
their top concerns. That's why the return of Washington gridlock will spur
demands for new political options--whether it's Ross Perot's infant Reform
Party or another movement.
   ``People are concerned by all the posturing and shifting of blame,''
says New Hampshire pollster Richard Bennett. ``All politicians are going to
pay the price.'' Perhaps. But until a resurgent Bill Clinton, unrepentant
Gingrichites, and comeback-minded Democratic liberals pause to assess the
long-term costs of their scorched-earth tactics, don't look for any break
from gridlock politics. All sides are having too much fun gumming up the
gears of the American political machinery to stop now.



If you liked the partisan battles of '95, you'll love what's in store for
'96

TAX REFORM
Expect early skirmishing over GOP plans to overhaul taxes. Republicans will
push competing plans for a flatter income tax. The Democrats want reform
that retains progressive tax rates and closes corporate loopholes.

REG-SLASHING
Republicans will renew calls for legislation that gives companies relief
from lawsuits and environmental mandates. The Democrats, allied with
Republican moderates, will again attack reform proposals as extreme.

WELFARE REFORM
Clinton's likely veto of the GOP welfare bill will send everyone back to
the table. In '96, Republicans hope to cast Clinton as a defender of
welfare deadbeats. Democrats will hold out for better work incentives and a
safety net for mothers.

POWER TO THE STATES
Republicans who failed in '95 to end entitlements for food stamps and other
programs will try to shift the programs to states. Democrats will argue
that states lack the resources to fund income-support plans during economic
downturns.

THE RIGHT'S AGENDA
Under heavy pressure from conservative freshmen, House Speaker Newt
Gingrich will allow votes on new abortion restrictions and a repeal of the
assault-weapons ban. Democrats will try to thwart both measures.

THE ECONOMY THAT FELL TO EARTH
Germany's slowdown is scaring its neighbors

By:
By John Templeman in Bonn, with Heidi Dawley in London, Silvia Sansoni in
Rome, and bureau reports


Germany is supposed to be Europe's locomotive. But thanks in part to recent
French strikes holding up shipments of German goods, gross domestic product
probably will show no growth in the fourth quarter, the second stagnant
quarter in a row. Unemployment, rising since last spring, is now at 9.3%.
Exports are weakening. Capital spending is slumping. And corporate profits
are falling. Says Ian Harwood, head of strategy and economics at London's
Kleinwort Benson Group PLC: ``Fears of a hard landing are growing.''
   Indeed, while a tax cut, a recent Bundesbank interest-rate reduction,
and a widely expected decline in the German mark may produce a brief
rebound in the first half, the year ahead looks grim. Unless consumers
unzip their pocketbooks in a hurry--and that looks doubtful--Germany will
have a hard time even reaching the anemic 2% growth rate it achieved in
1995 (chart).
   Such downbeat forecasts scare Germany's neighbors. ``If Germany slows
down, everyone else winds down with it,'' says Sergio De Nardis, senior
economist at Confindustria, the Italian industrialists' federation. That
could spell the end of Europe's grand plans for a single currency and
monetary union by the start of 1999. European Union nations, led by France
(box), already are struggling to cut budget deficits and cap government
debt levels to bring them in line with the Maastricht Treaty. But a serious
growth setback starting from Germany would lower tax revenues, raise
government borrowing, and bloat deficits across the EU, putting monetary
union out of reach and blowing further European unification out of the
water.
   To a great degree, Germans have themselves to blame for their
predicament. Economics Minister Gunter Rexrodt blames the current slowdown
on a high mark, big wage hikes, and rising taxes. Add overregulation of
business and rigid work rules, and it's no surprise that German companies
made some $26 billion in direct investments outside the country in the
first nine months of 1995, double the 1994 rate. The money is flowing to
Eastern Europe, Asia, and even Britain, whose manufacturing costs are 40%
lower than Germany's.
   The huge gap prompted Siemens, for example, to choose Britain as the
site for a $1.7 billion semiconductor plant. Consumer-products maker
Procter & Gamble Co., meanwhile, has stopped making new investments in
Germany. Its high business costs, warns Harald Einsmann, P&G regional
president, risk turning the country into the ``hole in the doughnut'' in
Europe's industrial landscape.
   As manufacturers rethink their commitment to Germany, hollowing out is
becoming a growth business. Two-thirds of management consultant McKinsey &
Co.'s German trade now consists of helping manufacturers expand production
in other parts of the world. Says Senior Partner Herbert Henzler:
``Germany's present export model--design it, make it, and export it from
here--is no longer viable.''
WARY CONSUMERS. With more companies adopting that mantra, workforce cuts
will continue. Germany has already lost 1 million jobs since 1992, mostly
in manufacturing. But employers' organizations warn that another 500,000 to
1 million jobs are at risk unless wage costs, particularly welfare taxes,
fall. Little wonder that in one recent poll, two-thirds of eastern
Germans--and half of those in the west--told the Allensbach-based
Demoskopie Institut that the risk of losing their jobs is now their biggest
worry.
   That's bad news for policymakers who are counting on a revival of
consumer demand. Many expect further Bundesbank rate cuts, and an $11
billion income tax reduction kicks in on Jan. 1. Will that money find its
way into stores? Some analysts are skeptical, noting that after months of
belt-tightening to pay higher taxes, many consumers aren't about to loosen
up with the economy slowing. ``We went without so much this year, that we
might consider spending [the tax rebate],'' says Gabi Lewin, a mother of
two whose husband works in an accountant's office. ``But if things get
worse over the short term, we might just sock it away and wait.''
   Reflecting that caution, retail sales fell 2.5% in 1995, the third
straight decline, and a hoped-for late spurt in Christmas buying failed to
materialize. And forget about 1996. Walter Deuss, chief executive officer
of the Karstadt department-store chain, notes that recent surveys ``don't
point to any durable improvement in consumer confidence.''
   While Germany waits for consumer spending to revive, the economy
continues to flag. If the U.S. is any guide, German restructuring efforts
could start bearing fruit around the time the EU plans to get its monetary
union into motion. That could leave Germany stronger and more competitive
than ever. Until then, expect anxiety levels to keep rising--in Germany and
across Europe.

NOW JUPPE HAS TO PICK UP THE PIECES

By:
By Bill Javetski in Paris


As Paris buses and subways began running again in late December after
France's worst strikes in three decades, drivers and token-booth clerks
cheerfully welcomed commuters back by letting them ride free of charge. It
was a smart public-relations move--but it was also unauthorized, showing
just how feisty France's public-sector unions are feeling after paralyzing
the country for 24 days. In forcing Prime Minister Alain Juppe to back away
from several key reforms, labor leaders have set the stage for a perilous
New Year as France tries to curb spending, revive growth, and prepare for
monetary union. Without a strong government in charge, achieving any of
those goals may be impossible.
   It is true that Juppe did not lose everything in his struggle with the
unions. In late December, a ``social summit'' with labor and industry left
intact a core plan to eliminate France's $12 billion health-care deficit.
But the realization is sinking in that ``Juppe is storing up problems for
the future,'' figures Christopher Potts, economist at Paris brokerage
Chevreux De Virieu.
BATTERED ECONOMY. For starters, Juppe's health-care plan probably marks the
limits of the reforms that his government will achieve. Tackling the costs
of France's civil service now seems impossible, since to end the strikes,
Juppe caved on the key points of reforming the loss-ridden national
railroad and aligning public-sector pensions with more restrictive
private-sector ones. And with his autocratic style, Juppe has failed to
build any kind of consensus for further cuts, even though government
spending is fast pushing up debt levels to dangerous heights (chart).
   Yet Germany, France's key European partner, is insisting on even deeper
French budgetary austerity for a possible monetary union. For a single
currency to work, France must meet the German demands. Even a vigorous
economic upturn won't be enough to keep Juppe from needing additional
spending cuts to shrink the deficit from its current 5% of gross domestic
product to 3% by the end of 1997. That's when France and other aspiring
candidates must prove they qualify for the currency union.
   France's economy enters 1996 badly battered from the strikes, which may
resume at the end of January. Estimates of the strikes' costs in lost
economic activity range as high as $4 billion. The crippling job action,
which dried up holiday shopping, put some 50,000 small businesses at risk
of failing, according to Conseil National du Patronat Francais, the French
employers' association. ``We're in recession now, and we'll enter 1996
slowing down further,'' says CNPF Vice-President Denis Kessler.
Unemployment, which recently began rising again, will top 12% by June, the
national statistics office estimates. Morgan Stanley Group Inc. economist
Eric Chaney sees France's economy growing just 1.3% next year. For 1997,
the critical year for picking nations that will be eligible for monetary
union, he sees France's budget deficit hovering above 4%, a full percentage
point off the target.
THIN GRUEL.. Boxed in by the unions, Juppe hopes to stimulate moribund
consumer activity by granting tax breaks to investors selling stakes in
money-market funds. To tackle 20% youth unemployment, he is looking to
persuade companies to fill half their job vacancies with people under the
age of 25. And he is calling on business and labor to speed up negotiations
over part-time work and other ways to make French industry more flexible.
   But that's thin gruel considering France's budgetary plight. The strikes
may be over for now. But their repercussions on France and all of Europe
will be felt through 1996 and beyond.

FROM BLUEPRINTS TO GRAND DESIGN
Ex-engineer John Correnti now must recast Nucor

By:
By Stephen Baker in Pittsburgh


As a young engineer, John D. Correnti built factories for a living. The job
kept him moving about as often as a traveling salesman. He built blast
furnaces in Ohio, a tire-cord factory in Georgia, a uranium plant in Texas.
He was usually hundreds of miles away, he now jokes, by the time any
glitches appeared. In 1983, Correnti was finishing up a steel mill in Utah
for Nucor Corp. when he got a surprise phone call from Chairman F. Kenneth
Iverson ordering him to run the plant. Correnti was stunned. ``You didn't
tell me I'd have to live with my mistakes,'' he protested.
   Iverson just called Correnti again--and this time he's turning the whole
shebang over to him. On Jan. 1, the 48-year-old executive will take over as
CEO of the Charlotte (N.C.) minimill giant, which is poised to pass
Bethlehem Steel Corp. as the second-biggest steel company in America,
trailing only the U.S. Steel Group of USX Corp. The transition shouldn't be
bumpy for the compact, silver-templed Correnti: Since 1991, he has been
Nucor's chief operating officer. What's more, Iverson is sticking around as
chairman. Still, taking over for a CEO who led Nucor to 30 years of strong
sales growth and solid profits is daunting. ``He's an icon,'' Correnti
says.
ADJUSTMENTS NEEDED. Correnti's promotion comes at a trying time for Nucor.
For a decade, it has been the high-flying Wal-Mart of the steel industry,
keeping costs down on basic products and passing the savings on to
customers. But as imitators spring up, also offering cheap, basic steel,
Nucor finds itself under pressure to revamp its product mix and get into
higher-margin steels. Meanwhile, it's still struggling with new technology
at its iron carbide plant in Trinidad. Worried investors have traded the
stock down to about $54, vs. last year's high of $72.
   Correnti admits Nucor has some adjusting to do. To compete in premium
markets, it must improve product quality. Customers in those markets, such
as auto and appliance makers, also demand lots of customized attention, a
specialty of the integrated steel companies.
   Yet Correnti takes over a strong, nearly debt-free company. As new
challengers grapple with startups in Kentucky and Indiana, Nucor already is
experimenting with making upscale stainless steel and ultrathin gauges in
its Indiana and Arkansas plants. Plus, it's busy building a third
flat-rolled steel mill, a $500 million behemoth in South Carolina. Correnti
expects Nucor's sales this year to jump 13%, to $3.35 billion, and earnings
to top 1994's record $227 million. He's looking for 15% to 20% sales growth
for the next five years. Even if Nucor stumbles, it likely will eclipse
U.S. Steel as the No.1 steelmaker by the year 2000. ``After South Carolina,
it would just take one more mill,'' he says.
FRIEND OF BILL. The question is whether Nucor under Correnti can stay
nimble. He says he will keep the 22-person headquarters small and continue
delegating great powers to the plant managers. His job? To oversee new
projects, stay in touch with Wall Street, and visit the 19 divisions two or
three times a year. Except for all the flying time--spent reading mystery
novels--Nucor's rapid growth rate won't be much of a drain on its CEO, he
says; ``What's the difference between 15 divisions and 30 divisions? It's
just a few more lines on the page.''
   Correnti is regarded as harder-driving than the genial Iverson, and he
preens a bit more in the limelight. He made friends with then-Governor Bill
Clinton when the company was negotiating plant sites in Arkansas. And he
continues to meet with Clinton, talking steel and politics at the White
House--or, more recently, chatting at a Little Rock banquet for retiring
Democratic Senator David H. Pryor. ``I'm one of the Republican Friends of
Bill,'' he says.
   He's also quicker than Iverson to make enemies. Speaking at Robert
Morris College in Pittsburgh, Correnti bulled into a subject most
executives sidestep, saying matter-of-factly that he would ``never dream of
building a mill'' in a union town like Pittsburgh. But as competition heats
up for Nucor, Correnti's combative ways might be just what the company
needs.

SHE IS THE NRA
Its first female chief is out to oust Clinton and lure women

By:
By Paul Magnusson in Washington


Marion P. Hammer was working late one night in Tallahassee when a carload
of thugs followed her into a parking garage and threatened her. ``I reached
into my purse, pulled out my gun, brought it up through the headlights, and
aimed right at the driver,'' she recalls. ``He put it in reverse, the tires
started smoking, and they were gone.''
   That was a decade ago, when Hammer was lobbying the Florida legislature
to relax restrictions on handguns. Her success there helped kick off a
28-state movement to ease restrictions on carrying concealed weapons. In
December, her record as a winning lobbyist and hard-line opponent of gun
control helped her become the first female president of the 3.3
million-member National Rifle Assn. after her predecessor, Thomas L.
Washington, died of a heart attack. Hammer, who had been vice-president, is
expected to run unopposed in April for a one-year term of her own.
   Now, the 56-year-old Hammer has her adversaries firmly in her sights.
She wants Congress to overturn the federal assault weapons ban.
``Restrictions on gun ownership are just a form of harassment,'' she says.
Next up is the defeat of pro-gun-control politicians--starting with the
President. ``The one thing we definitely plan to do is to work to beat Bill
Clinton,'' says Hammer.
   Hammer's confrontational style may be just right for today's embattled
NRA, which has image and money problems, has recently lost 200,000 members,
and is being audited by the Internal Revenue Service for allegedly
commingling funds. To boost membership again, Hammer plans to step up the
NRA's appeal to women and families using two time-honored NRA programs: the
``Refuse to be a Victim'' educational campaign for women, emphasizing crime
prevention and self-defense while promoting gun ownership; and the ``Eddie
Eagle'' gun-safety campaign for children, which is Hammer's personal
creation.
``WILDLY SUCCESSFUL.'' Under Hammer, the NRA won't neglect politics at the
statehouse either. She spent 20 years lobbying in Florida on behalf of gun
owners and proudly points to Florida's first concealed-weapons permit,
which allows her to pack her .38 caliber Colt Detective Special or her 9-mm
Beretta semiautomatic. ``During the past three years, the NRA has been
wildly successful in the states, and Hammer is the poster child for the
conceal-and-carry issue,'' laments Josh Sugarmann, director of the Violence
Policy Center, a gun-control group.
   Hammer, a grandmother of three, likes to unwind at the target range
after a day of hard lobbying. On the range or at the office, her opponents
say, she seldom misses her mark.

TELECOM: WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE WALLS FALL
Once reform passes, a frenzy of pair-ups is sure to follow

By:
By Joseph Weber in Philadelphia, with John Carey in Washington


They might as well be ringing a starting bell on the Capitol steps.
Washington's long revamp of telecommunications law is just about finished.
The message most telecom companies hear ringing loud and clear: Let the
deals begin.
   On Dec. 20, House and Senate conferees finally hammered out a compromise
that would allow Baby Bells, cable-TV operators, and long-distance
companies to invade one another's turf. It would also permit companies to
own more radio and TV stations than is now permitted. Thorny details, such
as how much to relax curbs on foreign ownership of U.S. companies, remain
to be determined. But says Representative Rick Boucher (D-Va.): ``All the
core issues have been settled. This will be landmark legislation.''
   Once the bill is passed, probably by early 1996, a swarm of mergers,
alliances, and joint ventures seems inevitable. That's because most of the
rigid regulatory barriers between segments of the industry will be gone.
Now, says Robert Barada, chief strategist for San Francisco-based Baby Bell
Pacific Telesis Group: ``Technology and customer demand are going to break
down the walls.''
``LOOKING.'' Which companies are likely to pair up? Bell Atlantic Corp. and
Nynex Corp. may be among the first, either through a complete merger
or--more probable--a joint venture on long-distance service. Bell Atlantic
CEO Raymond W. Smith and Nynex chief Ivan Seidenberg already have joint
ventures going to provide cellular phone service and, with PacTel, develop
programming for cable TV. Indeed, a Bell Atlantic spokesman calls a
long-distance joint venture with Nynex ``a real option.'' Adds Nynex
Telecom Group President Richard A. Jalkut: ``We are looking at all possible
combinations.''
   Teaming up to challenge AT&T, MCI Communications, and Sprint in the
long-distance market would make good business sense for the two Northeast
Baby Bells. The Bell Atlantic and Nynex regions account for $20.5 billion
of the nation's annual $73 billion long-distance bill (charts). A merger
would give the two Bells the marketing and technical firepower needed to
compete for customers. Just pooling their ad budgets--Bell Atlantic alone
spends about $105 million yearly on all advertising--would challenge the $1
billion the Big Three long-distance carriers spend promoting their phone
services.
   Who's next? Analysts expect each Baby Bell to eventually link up with at
least one other. Among the predicted pairings: Pactel and US West, San
Antonio-based SBC Communications and BellSouth, and, perhaps, Chicago-based
Ameritech with Bell Atlantic and Nynex. GTE Corp., with phone lines
scattered around the country, is expected to find allies, too. Among other
things, partnerships would help the Bells better tap international markets.
Team-ups of Southern Baby Bells, for instance, could move into Latin
America, while Western outfits could target the Pacific Rim.
CULTURE CLASH. Long-distance providers, too, should find dealmaking
irresistible. Pacts with the Baby Bells would eliminate the need to
duplicate local networks while providing potent marketing partners.
Analysts say MCI Communications Corp. is a natural ally for a Bell
Atlantic-Nynex team, for instance. But long-distance carriers are looking
further afield as well. Since late 1994, Sprint Corp. and cable operators
Tele-Communications, Cox Cable, and Comcast have been exploring ways to
leverage phone and cable-TV operations into advanced communications
systems. One caveat: A couple of years ago, Bell Atlantic sought to merge
with TCI in a failed deal that confirmed Smith's empire-building
aspirations. That failure showed how tough it can be to join the go-go
cable world with the more conservative Bells.
   Another caveat: Analysts figure AT&T will probably avoid cutting deals
with Baby Bells because it won't want to be accused of recreating Ma Bell.
It may team up instead with, say, Time Warner Inc.--already a rumored
negotiating partner--to use cable lines for local phone service. That would
dramatically blur the old lines between segments of the telecom
industry--and set the stage for even more radical change. The deals to come
will be ``complex, multifaceted, multidimensional things,'' says Tony
Ferrugia, a telecom analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
   In the end, the rewired telecom biz probably will include far fewer
players who will deliver better service and offer bold innovations. Ma Bell
won't exactly be coming back together after 12 years, but some of her
offspring almost certainly will.

ALL TOGETHER NOW: `MAKE THAT TO GO'
Insatiable demand for convenient, ready-to-eat meals has the food biz
scrambling

By:
By Greg Burns in Chicago


Boston Chicken Inc. didn't expect much when it tested ready-made holiday
meals this past Thanksgiving. But customers flocked in, gobbling down
hundreds of roast turkeys with all the fixin's. Why? ``People don't even
have time to cook Thanksgiving turkey dinner,'' says Saad J. Nadhir,
co-chairman of the take-out chain.
   In 1996, the nation's $900 billion food industry will be at the mercy of
customers who don't have time. Shoppers who can barely steal a few moments
to shop--let alone whip up home-cooked feasts--will set the pace of growth
for food processors, retailers, and food-service chains. The edge will go
to big, dominant companies that can use marketing clout to expand ``share
of stomach'' at the expense of weaker competitors. Other winners will be
innovators of all sizes that find new ways to ease the hunger pangs of a
harried populace.
   Inevitably, the time squeeze on shoppers will create losers, too,
especially among traditional full-line supermarkets. Their strong cash
flows give them enviable staying power, so an immediate shakeout is
unlikely. But erosion will continue as supermarkets face off against
up-and-comers such as Nadhir, who estimates that half the customers at his
fast-growing Boston Chicken chain would otherwise have cooked at home.
``You have too many retailers competing for too few food dollars and
appealing to consumers who have less time to deal with it,'' says
consultant Neil Z. Stern of Chicago's McMillan & Doolittle.
IDLE OVENS. Food processors and restaurant chains will see 5% to 6% revenue
growth in 1996, Stern estimates. Supermarkets will eke out 2% to 3% growth,
barely even with inflation. As U.S. households prepare fewer meals at home,
the percentage of food dollars spent at food retail stores--as opposed to
restaurants, cafeterias, convenience stores, and the like--will dip to 48%
in '96 from 55% a decade ago (chart). ``It's a great threat to
supermarkets,'' warns John H. Bryan, chief executive officer for Sara Lee
Corp.
   Consumers clamoring for ready-to-eat meals have made deli sales the one
supermarket bright spot. Supermarket chains such as Byerly's in Edina,
Minn., and Dominick's Finer Foods in Northlake, Ill., have pioneered new
in-store formats. In '96, expanded deli departments will attract at least 8
cents of each food dollar, up from 4 cents in 1986. And watch for more
supermarkets to introduce mall-style food courts featuring proven operators
such as McDonald's Corp., which is testing outlets at a Farmer Jacks
supermarket in Michigan and a Kroger in Tennessee. Food processors will
join in, too: Sara Lee has 17 sandwich shops serving its premium deli meats
inside Kroger supermarkets in Texas and Ohio.
   Among restaurant chains, cost control will be crucial. McDonald's has
cut the cost of opening a new restaurant by 30% over the past five years
through standardization and more reliance on drive-thru layouts. That has
helped McDonald's step up its U.S. growth fivefold, including joint
ventures that have put Golden Arches in Wal-Mart Stores, Home Depots,
Incredible Universe home-electronics stores, and Amoco gas stations.
FAR AND AWAY. With so many more outlets at hand, busy shoppers visit more
often, leaving less on the plate for the competition. Says McDonald's
Vice-Chairman Jack M. Greenberg: ``If you can dominate a trading area, it's
much more difficult and expensive for competitors to take customers away
from you.''
   Dominance matters to food processors, too. They're struggling to
increase scale and efficiency to satisfy the likes of supercenters, which
combine cut-rate supermarkets and discount stores under one roof. Food
processors also hope to give their ho-hum U.S. results a boost by pursuing
fast-growth markets overseas. And sharp operators such as H.J. Heinz, CPC
International, Campbell Soup, and others will be trying to lock in
relationships with fast-growing food-service operators. ``Everybody has the
same three strategies--lower domestic costs, grow internationally, and push
into food service,'' says analyst John M. McMillin at Prudential Securities
Inc.
   With all hands reaching for the same brass ring, the strongest brands
rule. As in 1995, industry players will sell off weak units to more
dominant competitors and buy businesses that enhance existing strengths.
The goal? Be No.1. ``I'm not even sure being No.2 is enough anymore,''
McMillin says. For investors, the message is clear: In the scrap over
``share of stomach,'' bet on the top dogs.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- With more consumers eating on the run, companies emphasizing
convenience will find eager customers.
   -- Food-service operators will grow by opening outlets in stores,
supermarkets, and gas stations.

Negatives
   -- Value-conscious shoppers will resist price increases.
   -- Supermarkets will continue to lose ``share of stomach'' to sharper
food-service operators, such as Boston Chicken.

MIGHTY MORPHIN POWER REARRANGERS
Deregulation will transform the industry--and continue to pinch profits

By:
By Mark Maremont in Boston


`Exciting, intense, and fun'': That's how a prominent electric-utility
executive describes his job these days. Surprised? If you thought
electricity was about as thrilling as dentistry, look again. A
three-year-old drive toward deregulation is causing new upheavals, from
cut-rate pricing to an unprecedented surge in mergers.
   On the regulatory front, the action in 1996 is likely to get a jump
start from an innovative plan approved by California's Public Utilities
Commission at the end of 1995. The plan, subject to change, would let some
customers shop for electricity from rival suppliers starting in 1998. The
long-awaited decision is another sign that the economic and political
forces propelling deregulation are too powerful to halt. Even American
Electric Power Co., the nation's second-largest investor-owned utility--and
at one time a staunch opponent of competition--proposed its own
far-reaching deregulation plan in 1995. Rather than fight the tide, says
Charles A. Falcone, an AEP senior vice-president, ``we have decided we want
to help shape the industry's new structure.''
SMOOTH SHIFT. AEP and other utilities had little choice. Profits will be
boosted or ravaged for years depending on how the industry and regulators
resolve some vexing questions. One big one is how far competition should
go. The most radical approach would let customers choose an electricity
supplier just as they choose a long-distance phone carrier, with power
flowing over still regulated lines maintained by the local utility. A more
moderate approach would retain today's basic structure but require
utilities to set rates based on prices in a wholesale power pool, which
proponents say would cut down on confusion. Muddying the waters, California
regulators decided to let both approaches coexist.
   Then there's the issue of the billions of dollars in uneconomical power
plants and long-term power contracts on the books of many utilities. These
will become millstones in a world where the cheapest power suppliers will
prevail. Big customers and some low-cost utilities contend that overly
expensive power plants and contracts should be written off, forcing
shareholders to bear the brunt of utilities' past poor decisions. But most
utilities argue that their costs are largely a legacy of poor regulations,
so customers should continue to foot the bill for a period. Allowing
customers to disregard their obligations ``is like asking your bank to let
you walk away from half your mortgage just because you want a new house,''
argues Thomas J. May, CEO of Boston Edison Co.
READY TO BID. More states will grapple with these and other contentious
issues in 1996, starting with Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Meanwhile,
utilities are shedding costs and their monopolistic mind-sets. Boston
Edison dumped one-fifth of its managers in 1995 and tried to spur new
thinking by reassigning most of those remaining to new jobs. WPL Holdings
Inc., a low-cost Wisconsin utility, has offered to show rivals' big
customers how much they could save by switching to WPL. It can't wrest away
the customers now, but it hopes to have the chance soon. ``Nobody owns
customers,'' says Erroll B. Davis Jr., WPL's aggressive CEO.
   Despite cost-cutting, profit margins aren't likely to improve much after
a five-year slide. Why? To stop defections, many utilities are cutting
prices to big customers 10% to 40% in return for long-term commitments.
Average aftertax profit margins declined to 17.2% in 1995, from 18.9% in
1991, says Daniel Scotto, an analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co.
   Moreover, some high-cost utilities are carrying artificial assets on
their books, such as payments due from customers over the next 20 to 30
years. If deregulation proceeds far enough, utilities may have to switch to
industrial accounting standards that don't recognize such assets. The
resulting megawrite-offs ``could get very ugly,'' says analyst Scotto, who
cites Centerior Energy Corp. as a prime candidate. Some utilities could be
forced into a restructuring or even bankruptcy.
   Also on tap for 1996 are more dividend cuts by an industry where
dividends once provided almost the only investment appeal. And mergers,
which reached a record $11.9 billion in 1995, are likely to keep surging,
especially if stock prices start to plummet as competition takes hold. No
question about it: The electric-utility industry isn't boring anymore.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Low interest rates have lightened debt loads.
   -- Delay in deregulation is allowing utilities more time to prepare.
   -- Demand for power is rising, and capacity is ample, so there's no need
for costly construction.

Negatives
   -- Demands by big customers for lower prices are hurting margins.
   -- High-cost utilities face a bleak future in
   -- deregulated world.

WHO SAYS YOU CAN'T FIND GOOD HELP?
Business-service firms boom as companies around the globe retool

By:
By Richard A. Melcher in Chicago


On some recent continent-hopping business trips, George T. Shaheen,
managing partner for Andersen Consulting, became thoroughly convinced that
change knows no boundaries. The rage in China was all about restructuring
and developing new markets. A Brazilian TV company was worried about how to
compete in foreign countries. ``It doesn't matter where you're doing
business,'' says Shaheen, ``everyone is going through a massive
retooling.'' While that may be wrenching to many, for Andersen and other
providers of business services, upheaval is a boon.
   Business services--a new category in BUSINESS WEEK's Industry
Outlook--encompasses legal services, advertising, personnel supply,
research and consulting, accounting, engineering, architecture, and
miscellaneous others, such as equipment rental and leasing. While their
growth rates vary, all of these industries to some degree cash in on the
continuing global trend toward seeking outside help. In 1996, predicts
DRI/McGraw-Hill, business services will grow 3.5% after inflation, to $806
billion in 1995 dollars.
   Consultants such as $4 billion Andersen should do far better than that.
Andersen, which specializes in providing advice on systems and so-called
change management, expects business to rise 20% for a second year and to
add as many as 8,000 people to its workforce of 37,000. Meantime, Bain &
Co. figures its business will jump 30% this year on the back of its
``growth'' consulting, which advises once shrinking clients how to grab
market share and find new customers overseas.
TEMP FEVER. Business-service providers will take on jobs of increasing
sophistication. Corporate layoffs will remain in the range of last year's
420,000 or so, figures outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, so
companies will continue to off-load everything from public relations to
computer services. That will ensure a fourth year of strong growth for the
temporary-help sector, which the National Association of Temporary &
Staffing Services estimates has annual revenues of $40 billion (chart).
``Temporary help used to be for emergency needs,'' says Manpower
International Inc. Chairman Mitchell S. Fromstein. ``Now, it's part of a
company's ongoing workforce strategy.'' Fromstein expects Manpower revenues
to be up some 15%--even higher than the industry's healthy 9% rise.
   At Manpower, as at scores of other companies, growth is being fueled by
demands for special skills. Today, Manpower is supplying computer
programmers and systems integrators as well as clerical workers.
Industrial-design specialists such as Boston's Design Continuum Inc. are
working with clients from research to final production. In advertising,
efforts to commercialize the Internet are providing golden opportunities
for nimble upstarts. ``The Internet will pose a major challenge for the big
agencies,'' says analyst James D. Dougherty of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
WORK, WORK. Generally, though, size seems to be an advantage. As industries
consolidate, companies turn to providers that can handle business globally.
In the advertising business, where growth is expected to be nearly 8%
thanks to election and Olympics spending, ``it's increasingly difficult for
midsize [advertising] agencies to compete,'' says Rochelle Lazarus, CEO of
giant Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide Inc.
   So look for the fragmented business-services sector to spawn plenty of
mergers. Last year, EDS Corp. purchased A.T. Kearney for $600 million,
marrying computer systems and engineering knowhow. This year, law firms are
ripe for combination, says consultant Bradford W. Hildebrandt. While law
firms are recovering from the depressed early '90s, Hildebrandt expects
revenues to rise 10% in 1996, so regional, national, and even international
mergers should be on the uptick. ``We'll see global consolidation like we
began seeing in accounting 10 years ago,'' predicts Hildebrandt.
   Other forces driving the mergers: difficulty in finding top
professionals and pricing pressure from customers. More and more companies
are demanding fixed fees from law firms. The outplacement industry has seen
commissions on large contracts drop from as much as 17% per individual to
about 10%, according to John A. Challenger. Yet across most of the growing
services sector, ``the No.1 risk and temptation'' is to take on more work
than firms have the ability to handle, say Bain's worldwide managing
director, Thomas J. Tierney. For now, that's a hurdle most service
providers are eager to attempt.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Continued industry restructuring favors a variety of services, from
temporary help to consulting and engineering.
   -- Booming economies in Asia and other markets offer new work to U.S.
architects, engineers, and advertisers.

Negatives
   -- A shortage of quality staff looms as businesses demand more
sophisticated services.
   -- Consolidation among clients adds price pressures and kills smaller or
less specialized firms.

WILL WALL STREET HIT A WALL?
It will be tough to match '95, but low rates could keep the market robust

By:
By Leah Nathans Spiro in New York


Wall Street should get another gift from the Federal Reserve in 1996:
continued low interest rates. DRI/McGraw-Hill predicts that 30-year
Treasury bonds will end the year at 6.26%, up just a tad from 6% at yearend
1995. Rock-bottom rates mean another super year for the securities
industry, since investors will keep deserting bank certificates of deposits
to seek higher returns in the stock market, boosting the market and Wall
Street commissions. ``From everything we see, it's going to be another good
year,'' declares John J. Mack, president of Morgan Stanley & Co.
   After a slow start, 1995 blossomed into a very good year for the
securities industry. New York Stock Exchange firms reaped an estimated $6.5
billion in pretax profits. That's the second-best year ever after 1993's
$8.6 billion blow-out. Fueling the industry was record stock-market volume,
thanks to a Standard & Poor's 500-stock index that soared 37% and strong
underwriting and mutual-fund sales.
   For 1996, the BUSINESS WEEK profit estimate is just $5.5 billion,
though. That's because it would be tough for rates to decline in 1996 as
much as they did in 1995, when they fell from 8% to about 6%. Declining
rates are Wall Street's dream environment, since they boost corporate
refinancing as well as the stock market.
TAKEOVER RUMORS. The new year is starting off with lots of momentum.
Mergers and acquisitions were red-hot in 1995, racking up $450 billion in
deals, topping the previous record of $355 billion in 1994, according to
Securities Data Co. ``There is no reason to believe the robust M&A market
won't continue,'' says Kim Fennebresque, a managing director at UBS
Securities Inc. Initial public offerings were another winner, with an
estimated $29 billion in new issues in 1995, almost reaching the 1993
record of $34 billion.
   Wall Street is notoriously cyclical, though, so the gold rush could slow
in '96. The stock market is unlikely to sustain its record performance for
two years in a row. The securities industry also faces excess capacity: Too
many firms are fighting for the same business. Aggressive up-and-comers
range from Germany's Deutsche Bank and Union Bank of Switzerland to U.S.
commercial banks. ``It's a difficult challenge to continue to maintain high
margins,'' says Jerome P. Kenney, a Merrill Lynch executive
vice-president.
   With so much competition, consolidation is expected to continue in 1996.
Rumors constantly have firms dressing themselves up for sale. Some of them,
such as Lehman Brothers Inc., PaineWebber Inc., and Prudential Securities,
are medium-size firms that are finding it expensive to compete
internationally. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, and Morgan
Stanley are spending heavily to position themselves as global competitors
that can remain independent. ``In 1996, the large will get larger, small
boutiques will prosper, and those in the middle will get squeezed,'' says
Bruce S. Foerster, president of South Beach Capital Markets Advisory Corp.
in Miami.
   Whether large or small, brokerage stocks are due for a correction.
Analysts aren't as hot on them, since they had a spectacular rise in 1995.
Merrill Lynch & Co. shares rose 51% through mid-December, and Charles
Schwab & Co. was up 86%. Mergers and acquisitions, hottest in banking and
media, might lose some steam.
   There are bright spots. Merrill Lynch, the biggest brokerage, sees
continued growth in its retail business. Its equity assets under management
have grown significantly in 1995 simply because the stock market was up
37%. This increase means more asset-management fee income in 1996, even if
the growth of assets slows. And following a dismal 1995 in many emerging
markets, Merrill is looking for an improvement in 1996.
   The entire industry may get a boost from Washington. A capital-gains tax
cut and a restoration of tax deductibility for individual retirement
accounts look likely in 1996, says Marc E. Lackritz, president of the
Securities Industry Assn., since ``there is broad agreement among the
House, the Senate, and the Administration that this is a good idea.'' The
SIA estimates the IRA change alone could earn the industry as much as $200
million a year in additional IRA mutual-fund fees.
   Of course, it's the unexpected that hurts markets the most, as in the
last big market plunge with the gulf war in 1991. A recession or sharply
higher rates are constant worries. But it now looks as if Wall Street can
spend another happy year looking forward to bonus time.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- The soaring stock market is boosting the brokerage business.
   -- Mergers, acquisitions, and IPOs should remain strong.
   -- Congress may cut capital-gains taxes and restore deductibility of
IRAs.

Negatives
   -- Brokerage stocks are due for a correction after their big 1995
runup.
   -- Overcapacity in the industry will keep restraining margins.

A YEAR OF HIGH-RISE EXPECTATIONS
The office market expects a banner year, while other markets look less
robust

By:
By Amy Barrett in Washington


For much of the past two years, the real estate and construction industry
celebrated the return of growth. Having survived the dark days of the early
1990s, investors savored the recovery of apartment and retail properties,
followed by offices and hotels. But 1996 will be more of a mixed bag. On
the downside, there are early signs of overheating in some markets for
construction of apartment and retail space. On the upside, a stronger
housing market should help pick up the slack. And with office occupancy and
rents improving, 1996 will mark the return of one fixture of the 1980s:
high-rise office projects.
   The generally good news for real estate stems largely from the continued
decline of interest rates. Lower rates helped spark homebuilding in the
second half of 1995. And National Association of Home Builders Chief
Economist David F. Seiders figures moderate economic growth will lead to
even lower mortgage rates in 1996, averaging about 7.3% for 30-year
fixed-rate mortgages. That should nudge multi- and single-family housing
starts up about 3%, to nearly 1.4 million. The days of speculative boom and
bust are gone: ``People look at houses as shelter rather than as an
investment strategy, and frankly that's pretty healthy,'' says Bruce E.
Karatz, chairman of Los Angeles-based Kaufman & Broad Home Corp.
   Apartment construction continues to pick up steam. According to the
NAHB, construction will begin on 290,000 apartments in 1996, up a bit from
1995's 274,000. While that is still less than half the 1985 frenzied peak
of nearly 670,000 units, industry pros are warning that some Sunbelt
markets, such as Phoenix and Las Vegas, may already be overbuilt.
BANNER YEAR. In retail construction, megamerchants such as Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. and Circuit City Stores Inc. are aggressively expanding. But it
doesn't appear that the market is headed for a repeat of the overbuilding
binge of the 1980s. Retail construction should fall 10% in 1996, according
to The McGraw-Hill Companies' F.W. Dodge unit. One reason: Aside from the
retail giants that can finance their own expansion, ``capital is pretty
well cut off to that sector,'' says Douglas A. Tibbetts, president of
Equitable Real Estate Investment Management Inc.
   Players in the office market expect 1996 to be a banner year. Thanks in
no small part to the explosive growth of high-technology companies, office
vacancy rates continue to slide. And the strength of the market is sparking
not only build-to-suit construction but some partially speculative building
in tight markets. Arthur J. Mirante II, chief executive officer of Cushman
& Wakefield Inc., says some cities will see construction with as little as
50% of the project pre-leased. ``The fundamentals for office haven't been
this good in 10 years,'' says Thomas A. Carr, president of Carr Realty
Corp. in Washington, D.C.
   Still, not all markets are booming. Los Angeles and downtown Dallas,
which has a staggering vacancy rate of 35%, are still struggling. And
Arthur Andersen & Co. Managing Director Barry D. Libert warns that better
and cheaper telecommunications will allow more tenants in the future to
avoid downtown locations. As a result, office operators will be forced to
beef up their marketing and improve the flexibility of lease packages.
   Perhaps the best buys around remain high-end hotel properties. Outside
of Las Vegas, there is little new construction of luxury hotels. And
Japanese investors who overpaid for such properties in the 1980s continue
to sell. A Japanese bank recently sold the 539-room Ritz Carlton Hotel,
Mauna Lani, in Hawaii, built for $180 million, for just $75 million.
SMALL FAVORS. While the Japanese are selling, U.S. real estate continues to
attract U.S. pension funds, which should cautiously expand their holdings
in 1996, as well as foreign investors, from such places as Hong Kong,
Taiwan, and Germany. Real estate investment trusts aren't raising a lot of
money through public offerings--investment dollars have gone into the
booming stock market instead--but they're discovering that private
placements can work, too. For instance, Carr Realty struck a deal in
November that will result in a $250 million investment in the REIT by
Security Capital U.S. Realty. Carr plans to use the capital to build and
buy offices across the country.
   1996 won't see a return to the glory days of leaping prices. But these
days, most real estate executives are thankful for slow but steady
progress.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- The office sector will continue to recover, thanks in part to strong
demand by high-tech companies.
   -- Upscale hotels should enjoy rising room rates and healthy occupancy
levels.

Negatives
   -- Some shopping centers will feel the squeeze from a sluggish retail
market.
   -- With apartment construction still picking up steam, some Sunbelt
markets may already be overbuilt.

LOOKING FOR SAFETY IN NUMBERS
Consolidation--and competition from other investments--are changing the
business

By:
By Tim Smart in New Haven


If there is one word that sums up prospects for the insurance industry in
1996, it's consolidation. Last year saw a record $18 billion worth of
insurance-company mergers and acquisitions, and there's no letup in sight.
``There are too many players competing for too little return in a crowded
marketplace,'' says Eric Simpson, a vice-president at rating agency A.M.
Best Co.
   The late November announcement of Travelers Inc.'s $4 billion purchase
of Aetna Life & Casualty's property-casualty unit capped a year in which
CNA Financial swallowed Continental Insurance for $1.1 billion and Zurich
Insurance took over Home Insurance. The same pressures that forced these
deals--weak returns, large exposures to environmental claims, and lack of
sufficient capital to keep ratings up--are expected to continue in 1996.
While the companies have said nothing publicly, analysts believe that CIGNA
Corp. and Prudential Insurance Co. are among the big-name companies
considering selling their property and casualty units.
CUTTING OVERHEAD. For property-casualty insurers, two big helpers are low
inflation and low interest rates. The benign operating environment in 1995
led to a doubling of net income, to $22.3 billion from $10.9 billion in
1994.
   In 1996, however, property-casualty insurers should see only a modest
uptick in their business. A survey of Wall Street analysts by Insurance
Information Institute found them expecting growth in premium dollar volume
of about 4.6% in 1996. While that would be better than the 3.9% rate of
growth in 1995, it will still lag behind the growth of the early 1990s. The
problem: continued price pressures from overcapacity, especially in
commercial lines, such as general business liability and workers'
compensation. ``There has been no fundamental improvement in underlying
performance during the last five years,'' says Robert Stein, director of
Ernst & Young's insurance-industry practice.
   With paltry premium growth, property- casualty insurers will have to cut
overhead, now a quarter on every dollar of premium. Travelers hopes to trim
$300 million from operating expenses and cut 3,000 jobs when it takes over
the Aetna unit.
   The consolidation trend affecting property-casualty writers is no less
dramatic in life insurance. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. and New England
Mutual Life Insurance Co. have announced plans to merge, while several
operators, such as General Electric Capital Services Inc., went on buying
sprees. Here, the motivation is increasing assets under management to
compete with gargantuan mutual-fund houses and other financial-services
conglomerates.
EXPENSIVE DISTRIBUTION. Life insurers enter 1996 facing continued weakness
in their core business as more Americans turn away from traditional life
insurance to investment products such as mutual funds. While mutual funds
are sold through low-cost, consumer-oriented direct marketing such as
television, life insurers still sell their products mainly face-to-face
through an expensive network of agents.
   A survey by consultant Towers Perrin found that the No.1 issue of
concern for life-insurance chief executive officers is improving their
distribution system. Towers Perrin consultant Rick Berry estimates that
distribution makes up two-thirds of the cost of a life-insurance policy.
``Traditional life companies have delegated to their agents decisions like
what mix of products to sell, what markets to pick, and how to promote the
products,'' says Berry. Many life insurers have begun striking deals with
banks to sell their products, a trend that is likely to accelerate in
1996.
   Insurers have had good results selling annuities, which typically offer
income or capital gains as well as life insurance. The 13% rate of growth
for annuities is four times the rate for traditional life insurance
products. But competition is getting fierce. ``It's a changing landscape,''
says CNA Chairman and CEO Dennis H. Chookaszian. ``Banks will be a much
more significant seller of these products in the future.'' A positive for
life insurers is that their mortgage and real estate problems of the early
1990s have largely dissipated, while strong financial markets have helped
investment returns.
   A couple of years back, few would have imagined alliances such as
Travelers' bold deal with Aetna or life insurance companies allowing their
competitors in banking to sell their products. But as the historically
underperforming insurance industry tries to catch up to the new world order
in financial services, it is learning to adapt.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Life insurers are holding on to their share of retirement assets.
   -- Property-casualty writers are increasing reserves for environmental
claims.
   -- Losses from claims are moderating.

Negatives
   -- Much of the industry's increased capital is coming from investment
gains, not core earnings.
   -- With 2,400 competitors, the business is ripe for consolidation.

THE TOP MANAGERS OF 1995
What did it take for an executive to succeed in the past year?

Good managers know how to cut: They trim costs, reengineer, and
restructure. Great managers know how to grow: They realize you can't shrink
your way to greatness. In 1995, the best managers in the world grew their
way to greatness.
   The men and women of BUSINESS WEEK's Top 25 Managers of the
Year--Americans, Europeans, Asians--all rode the tiger of growth to
spectacular success. In a global economy of vast technological change,
intense competition, and political upheaval, these managers cranked out
annual increases of 20%, 30%, sometimes even 40% in profits and
sales--while other corporate ``titans'' were still trimming their sails and
eking out marginal gains.
   What did it take for an executive to make it into BUSINESS WEEK's Top
25? Begin with product innovation--the hot strategy of the year for
managers who had already wrung out their corporate inefficiencies. When the
bureaucratic layers are gone, when the marginal competencies are dumped,
the only strategic assets left to corporations are the products they sell
in the global marketplace. This was proved in 1995, when the most reliable
path to fast growth was to bring out new products adored by lots of
consumers.
   Riding the technological currents was the favorite tactic used by
managers in bringing out their innovations in 1995. But managers also had
to take risks, especially the risk of cannibalizing old models with new
products. There was new software for personal computers and the Internet,
color copier/printers for the home office, and even new first-class seats
that fold out into beds. All were smash hits.
   BUSINESS WEEK's top managers used corporate alliances to drive their
growth. American and European managers divvied up the incredibly successful
DBS launch--direct broadcast satellite transmission of TV and stereo music.
A French-owned company built the 12-inch satellite dishes for the home, and
the Americans developed the satellites and software to close the loop.
Nearly two million homes in the U.S. now have DBS. This global cooperation
generated tremendous growth for all concerned. So did alliances between
industries: One software giant linked up with a corporation running a TV
network to provide new information products over the wire.
   Top managers used globalization strategies wisely to boost growth. Asian
territories outside Japan proved once again to be the fastest-growing
markets in the world in 1995. Every smart manager wanted a bigger piece of
the Asian pie. Some succeeded, as did one investment banker who was able to
cut a deal enabling his firm to do business inside China. Another American
manager reversed strategy and revitalized his heavy capital equipment
company by focusing on new opportunities in Europe.
   Then there were Asian managers using the global markets to move outside
their region into other parts of the world. One computer maker divided his
operation into 21 smaller companies so that each could list on the stock
market where it did most of its business.
   Of course, reengineering remained important as a catalyst for growth for
some top managers. One new Japanese manager quietly restructured ingrown
business practices of his company and led it to a projected doubling of net
profit and a record year. An American continued to reshape a traditional
defense-base conglomerate into a tough market-oriented competitor.
   How did BUSINESS WEEK come up with its Top 25 Managers of the Year? The
magazine polled its 220 editors around the world, including its large
foreign bureau system, the largest of any global business magazine. The
methodology was deceptively simple: screening the financial figures,
questioning the best analytical minds, and talking to the leading corporate
managers around the world. The bureaus asked: Who was the best in 1995?
Here's the collective reply.

chairman of UAL, managed to make lots of people happy in 1995. By more than
doubling the stock price, to $211, Greenwald, 60, put big smiles on all

SCOTT G. MCNEALY

Hot Java! Sun Microsystems CEO SCOTT G. McNEALY went eye to eye with Bill
Gates in 1995 with Java, the revolutionary Internet software. But that was
just icing for McNealy, 41. Sun's ``servers'' became serious contenders in
corporate computing. For Sun, it meant an 82% rise in profits, to $356
million, on sales of $5.9 billion in fiscal 1995.

ROBERT AYLING, British Airways' managing director, ran one of the world's
most profitable airlines in 1995. His reward: being made CEO as of Jan. 1.
BA is expected to report $890 million in pretax profits on sales of $12
billion for the year ending March, 1996. Smashing! Ayling, 49, skipped
college and climbed the corporate ladder without family or school ties. He
now must decide whether to put more money into USAir. Don't bet on it.

For TADASHI SEKIZAWA, 1995 was the year Fujitsu finally cast off the
shackles of a weak economy and soaring yen. Sekizawa, 64, restructured
ingrown business practices and dumped nationalistic policies. Fujitsu
starting selling PCs built 90% with non-Japanese components. It expects to

JEAN-PIERRE ROSSO

When JEAN-PIERRE ROSSO took over heavy-equipment manufacturer Case in 1994,
it hadn't turned much of a profit in years. Cost-cutting by parent Tenneco
stopped the bleeding, but there was no strategy. He redesigned Case's
outdated construction- and agricultural-equipment lines and focused on
Europe. The payoff? Earnings in 1995 should double, to $250 million, on an
11% hike in sales, to $4.8 billion.

In early 1994, an avalanche of cheap Russian metal threatened to bury
America's world-leading aluminum companies. Aluminum Co. of America's CEO,
60-year-old PAUL H. O'NEILL, pushed for a multinational solution, which
included painful smelter shutdowns in the U.S. He also pressed forward with
global acquisitions, from Italy to Australia. With aluminum prices on the
rebound in 1995 and world supply and demand on a more even keel, Alcoa
motored to strong earnings.

For WILLIAM C. STEERE JR., 59-year-old CEO of Pfizer, the big payoff came
in 1995. He sold off nondrug operations and refused to shell out billions
for distributors, as rivals have. Instead, the avid helicopter skier has
focused on riskier new products. Driven by antidepressant Zoloft and
antihypertensive Norvasc, Pfizer's net income in 1995 rose 20%, to nearly
$1.56 billion, while sales gained 23%, to $10.2 billion.

MANAGERS TO WATCH IN 1996

Abigail Johnson, 34, is heir very apparent at Fidelity Investments. The
boss's daughter owns 24.5% of Fidelity. That makes her a billionaire, but
is she a manager capable of taking over from Dad, Edward C. ``Ned'' Johnson
III, who is 65? So far, Abby has dodged a role in senior management to
manage money. Will she become chairwoman and leave day-to-day management to
others?

Eric A. Benhamou, chief executive officer of 3Com, loves to manage--other
businesses, that is. He is Silicon Valley's gentlest takeover artist. His
3Com pulled off 10 acquisitions worth $1 billion in three years. Now he's
trying to persuade Wall Street that he can make money in the expanding
market for lower-end networking gear and PC network cards for small
business and the home. Tired of slowpoke modems? Call Benhamou.

Ford Chairman Alex Trotman probably has the toughest job in Detroit in
1996. Customers aren't stampeding to his newly styled Taurus. Ford is
overhauling 40% of its entire U.S. product line and 35% of its European
offerings. Trotman is under pressure to find a way to move all these new,
more expensive models in a market that is interested only in bargains. Will
lower rates give Trotman some breathing room by cutting leasing costs?

In April, 1995, Nobuyuki Idei, 58, became the first nonengineer to lead
Sony, replacing Norio Ohga. He quickly dumped Mickey Shulhoff, Sony's
high-profile U.S. head. Idei speaks fluent English and French, but it has
yet to be seen whether he can speak Hollywoodese.

Bill Gates faces his biggest challenge in years. While the 40-year-old
chairman of Microsoft has the PC software market sewn up--not so the
mushrooming Internet world. In December, Gates mapped out an ambitious
Internet strategy. Then he licensed Java, the hot Internet software. Is
this a new beginning or the end of his hegemony?

For as long as Jerry Levin has been chairman of Time Warner, investors have
wondered if he had the ``it'' of leadership. This fall he acted boldly and
acquired Turner Broadcasting System. But now he has to stir up that magic
synergy, something he couldn't do between Time Inc. and Warner. Is this his
last shot?

Gerhardt Schulmeyer, chief executive at German computer and telecom company
Siemens Nixdorf Informations Systems, is aiming to topple Big Blue in
Europe. But can he break the great resistance to change within Germany's
telecom industry? If Schulmeyer can't do it in 1996, Germany will only fall
further behind.

Whoever thought an obscure animal-feed ingredient could lead to so much
fuss? But for Dwayne O. Andreas, chairman of Archer Daniels Midland, lysine
could be his Waterloo. Federal antitrust investigators are reviewing hours
of taped conversations provided by a former employee, Mark Whitacre, who
claims ADM fixed lysine prices. Meantime, under fire from shareholders,
Andreas, 77, has appointed a committee of outside directors to put ADM
corporate governance under a microscope. Can he survive another year?

Ditto for Michael H. Spindler. With first-quarter results ending Dec. 31 in
the red, following a year of takeover rumors and boardroom turmoil, Apple
Computer's embattled CEO is hanging on by a thread. The board is backing
him for now.

Insiders says W. James McNerney Jr., a 46-year-old Yale graduate and
Harvard MBA, is a front-runner in the race to succeed Jack Welch as CEO of
General Electric. In October, Welch pulled McNerney away from a critical
post as head of GE's Asia operations to take over management of the $3
billion lighting unit.

Lester M. Alberthal Jr. may soon find himself running an independent
Electronic Data Systems, the information services giant in Plano, Tex. EDS
has been part of General Motors since 1984, when it was sold by famous
founder Ross Perot. GM announced in August, 1995, that it planned to spin
off EDS if it can get the Internal Revenue Service's approval for a
tax-free deal. Analysts expect EDS's independence day to come by the
spring.

When you're running for your life, do you reach for a Snapple or a
Gatorade? William D. Smithburg, CEO of the Quaker Oats, has his hands full
with both. His dominant Gatorade franchise faces a terrific challenge in
'96 as Coca-Cola promotes its rival sports drink, Powerade, at the 1996
Olympics. He has even knottier problems with his Snapple franchise.

Can Hiroshi Okuda cure Toyota's big-company disease? In August, the
63-year-old finance man became president of Japan's largest auto maker, the
first non-Toyoda family member to run the company. Many see the bold
executive as the best hope for a fresh breeze at Toyota.

Can a power-tool marketing whiz finally put some drive back into Polaroid?
On Dec. 1, 44-year-old Gary T. DiCamillo took the reins as the new CEO.
Given credit for reviving Black & Decker's consumer power tool business,
he's now charged with resurrecting a company that has been drifting
sideways for years.

Journalists recoiled in 1995 as new Times Mirror CEO Mark H. Willes closed
New York Newsday and ordered layoffs at the flagship Los Angeles Times.
Willes, a 15-year veteran of General Mills, was brought in to repair years
of sluggish profits at Times Mirror. His goal: boost earnings per share by
50% in 1996.

How sweet it is. STEVE JOBS, co-founder of Apple Computer, has been trying
to come up with a second hit for a decade. No such luck--until Nov. 29.
That's when his company, Pixar Animation Studios, makers of the smash hit
movie Toy Story, went public with a bang. The stock, priced at 22, zoomed
to 49 before falling back to 24. Jobs's 80% stake was briefly worth $1.1
billion. What's next? His other company, NeXT, is making Web software, and
Jobs may see his third IPO in early 1996.

The 1970s gave tennis buffs the oversize racket; the 1980s, the widebody;
and now, in the 1990s, there's the extralong. With its Max series, Dunlop
Slazenger led the pack with the newest racket technology, adding 1 1/2
inches to the standard 27-inch frame. It's 125 square inches--15 more than
most big rackets. At 9 1/2 ounces, the extralongs are extremely light.
They're best suited to average-size men, seniors, beginners, and women who
don't pound the ball and want a little more on their serve. Price: $225.

HAS CADDY TURNED THE CORNER?

   I have received numerous inquiries from your readership concerning ``A
Caddy that's not for Daddy'' (The Corporation, Dec. 18). Despite
considerable disclosure of facts and open discussion, your author chose to
include her opinions and the clearly biased opinions of our competitors
without including any of our perspective.
   With regard to our reduction in sales volume: Cadillac's planned and
profitable reduction of daily rental fleet sales accounts for much of the
reduction in the division's sales from 1989 to 1995. While we chose not to
foreshadow our 1995 calendar year forecasts to competitors by providing
them for this story, we did provide a yearly accounting of our daily rental
fleet reduction statistics (from 32% of total sales in 1991 to 18% in
1994). We expected that disclosure of this plan and accompanying
performance would not be omitted from your review of our sales
performance.
   As for our dealers, you characterized the perception of them as
``salesmen in white belts and plaid sport coats'' and continued to
perpetrate a disservice to our very professional dealer personnel. Our
dealers consistently earn high customer-satisfaction scores and were once
again rated No.1 domestic luxury nameplate in a recent J.D. Power &
Associates Inc. Sales Satisfaction Survey, second only to Infiniti and
ahead of Lexus, Mercedes, Lincoln, BMW, and all other luxury brands.
   You also raise questions about our customer demographics. Fundamental
changes in our owner demographic profile have resulted from the
introduction of the 1992 Seville, Seville Touring Sedan, and Eldorado
models. The author accurately quoted the average age of ``some model''
owners at nearly 70. Specifically, this model is the Fleetwood, which we
are eliminating from the model line this year. A fair accounting of our
progress would also have noted that the average age of Seville STS owners
is 52 years, an average age that has been reduced by six years since the
introduction of this model in 1991.
   Regarding side air bags, we were disappointed to note that your author
chose to omit the rollout of air bags in the 1997 DeVille model, mentioning
only the introduction for Catera in mid-1997 and again creating the
appearance that Cadillac was behind other luxury manufacturers in the
implementation of this technology. The introduction of the side air bags at
the beginning of the 1997 model year on the DeVille was made very clear in
our interview.
   Finally, you refer to us as ``an industry joke.'' In spite of the fact
that nine new models have been added to the luxury market from two all-new
manufacturers (Lexus and Infiniti) since 1989, Cadillac continues as volume
leader in the U.S. luxury market--a title held for the last 46 years. The
DeVille remains America's most-purchased luxury sedan--a title held for the
past nine years. The Northstar-powered Seville STS is a recognized
technology tour de force among automotive critics and enthusiastic owners.
The all-new Catera has been reviewed favorably by all of the author's
colleagues.
   The above-listed facts and many other positive points concerning
Cadillac's overall performance were omitted from your story. Our market
leadership and product leadership makes preposterous the notion that
Cadillac is the brunt of jokes in the industry. To the contrary, our
product technology and large loyal owner base are the envy of the
industry.
John O. Grettenberger
General Manager
Cadillac Motor Car Div.
Warren, Mich.

Editor's note: Cadillac supplied numbers on fleet sales only through 1994
and acknowledged that it expected total sales to decline by 15% in 1995.
Our description of the negative perception of Cadillac dealers focused on
younger buyers it hopes to attract with the Catera and matches the Catera
team's own characterization of its consumer research.

   Your story on the Catera missed the mark. As I see it, Catera is yet
another encouraging step as Cadillac transforms itself. Why keep harping on
the Cimarron, unquestionably a Stone Age disaster? Cadillac left the Stone
Age long ago. Why not mention the Seville Touring Sedan, Detroit's most
exciting world car? What about the national Baldrige Quality Award Cadillac
received in recognition of quality and changes in culture? And what about
the Northstar system? You're much too bleak. At 57, I am most certainly a
Daddy. But Catera just may be the Caddy I've been waiting for--and my
boomer son, too.
Dan Panshin
St. Paul, Minn.

   Regarding General Motors Corp.'s plans for the new Catera, your article
left out a few more mistakes that the Cadillac Div. has made in past years
besides the Cimarron and the Allante. How about the 8-6-4 engines and the
early model Sevilles?
   Cadillac had better be satisfied with its grandfather image, because any
middle-aged luxury-car buff worth his salt would not even think about a new
Cadillac, considering the company's track record for the past 15 years.
Especially with introductory models.

`TERRORISTS SHOULD NEVER BE CONFUSED WITH DISSIDENTS'

   I must take exception to your story about Saudi Arabia in your Nov. 27
issue (``A dangerous spark in the oil fields,'' International Business).
BUSINESS WEEK played into the hands of terrorists by trying to create a
link between the terrorist car bombing in Riyadh that claimed the lives of
five Americans and the internal situation in our country.
   Even though no one knows yet who committed this act of murder, your
article stated that the car bombing ``suggests once again that internal
enemies, not external ones, may now be the biggest threats'' to states on
the Arabian Peninsula.
   Whether in the U.S., Israel, France, Egypt, or Saudi Arabia, people may
disagree about internal policies. But terrorists should never be confused
with dissidents. Terrorists kill because they are criminals and murderers.
They do not need an ``excuse,'' especially feeble ones such as ``belt
tightening,'' as cited in your article.
   The ``internal situation'' that you described did not cause the car
bombing any more than the U.S. budget crisis caused the Oklahoma City
bombing. Terrorism is a meaningless act. As your story revealed, if you
search for ``reasons,'' you will only be led astray.

EXPORT DIVERSION, MAYBE. DUMPING, ABSOLUTELY

   Regarding ``Exports that aren't going anywhere'' (Legal Affairs, Dec.
4), I'd feel sorrier for companies whose low-priced exports are being
diverted back to the U.S. if they weren't meeting the classic definition of
dumping: selling at a lower price in a foreign country than they do
domestically.
   When a foreign manufacturer sells at a lower cost in the U.S. than it
does in its own country, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is all over
them. Are American companies claiming injury when their dumping activities
result in the obvious economic consequences? Wait until the other
countries' FTC equivalents get through with them.
   The reality is that price differentials are extremely difficult to
maintain in the global economy. If the law doesn't get you, economics
will.

TRAVELERS DOESN'T TRAFFIC IN HARD SELLING

   Your recent article on ``How Travelers got moving again'' (Finance, Dec.
4) stated that CEO Robert I. Lipp ``began pushing Travelers homeowners' and
auto policies through the PFS network of 100,000 hard-sell part-time
agents, who work for commissions far below the typical 15% paid...'' The
article was great, but the connotation that PFS agents employ hard-sell
tactics is incorrect. Roughly 80% of the sales force is in fact part-time
and does not rely on commissions to make a living. Thus, the basic PFS
approach is educational, not confrontational. Part-time PFS agents do not
have to make the sale to put food on the table. Hard sell? Nothing could be
further from the truth.

A WINNING NUMBER FOR THE LABORITES?
The national lottery flap may further undermine the Tories

By:
By Julia Flynn in London


`Scamalot.'' That's what critics are now calling Camelot Group PLC, the
for-profit, Anglo-American consortium running Britain's national lottery.
After barely a year of operation, Camelot Group is weathering a storm of
controversy. Among the allegations are offering bribes, cozying up to
government regulators, and paying top executives unseemly salaries for the
low-risk chore of peddling lottery tickets to wager-loving Britons.
   The consortium denies any impropriety, and no one at Camelot has been
formally charged with any wrongdoing. No matter. The Labor Party is turning
Scamalot into a referendum on the ruling Tories' laissez-faire approach to
business. With elections just a year away, Labor will do everything to keep
the issue hot. Pressure already is mounting to revamp government oversight
of the lottery and to turn the operation over to a not-for-profit group
when Camelot's license expires in 2001.
   The Conservatives had reasoned that a for-profit business would operate
a lottery more efficiently than a state-run firm. So after reviewing both
for-profit and not-for-profit bids, the government went with Camelot. It's
composed of four British companies--candy and soft-drinks giant Cadbury
Schweppes, computer maker ICL, Racal Electronics, and banknote printer De
La Rue--and one U.S. company, lottery operator GTech Corp. A new government
agency--the Office of the National Lottery, or Oflot--oversees Camelot.
``SMELL FACTOR.'' By December, Camelot was estimating it would sell $7
billion worth of tickets and scratch cards in its first year, making the
lottery one of the world's biggest. Then controversy flared. On a BBC
investigative program, Richard Branson, owner of Virgin Atlantic Airways,
alleged that Guy B. Snowden, GTech's co-chairman and a Camelot director,
had offered him a bribe to withdraw his group's bid for the lottery.
Branson said he informed Oflot's director general, Peter Davis, of the
alleged bribe, but Davis denies being told. Snowden labels the charges
``beneath contempt'' and is considering a libel suit against Branson, who
is already suing GTech for libel. On Dec. 20, Davis said an investigation
would begin in January.
   The same day as the BBC broadcast, Davis admitted to a House of Commons
committee that he had accepted rides in GTech's jets, helicopters, and
limousines while touring state lotteries in the U.S. Davis also has
acknowledged a close friendship with GTech board member Carl B. Menges. In
a heated debate, Labor member Donald Anderson argued that the ``smell
factor'' prevents Davis from having ``the credibility necessary for the
performance of his functions.'' The government so far has refused to sack
Davis.
SCRUTINIZED. Labor MPs also are raising questions about whether Oflot let
Camelot profit at the expense of the good causes it is supposed to fund.
Camelot made a $37 million profit on revenues of $3.9 billion during the
half-year ended in September and paid out a $14.6 million dividend to its
five shareholders, the maximum payout allowed under its license. Yet in a
September 1994 letter to an MP, Oflot's Davis wrote that based on the
consortium's forecast he expected it would be ``over four years before
Camelot shows a cash return on its investment.'' Camelot says it did not
``deliberately understate'' its expected returns.
   Meanwhile, Camelot's pay packets are raising eyebrows, too. Camelot
Chief Executive Tim Holley received $682,785 for 1995, including a $184,800
bonus. Holley declines to comment. Oflot says it doesn't regulate the pay
at Camelot, but in a country where high salaries arouse ire, this argument
is hardly convincing. Says Denis Vaughan, an orchestra conductor who
started the move for a lottery to help the arts: ``Oflot is more of a
lapdog than a watchdog.''
   GTech merits far closer watching as well, Camelot's critics say. The
Rhode Island-based company, which operates 74 lotteries for governments and
other public authorities, has endured scrutiny for its methods of winning
contracts in the U.S. Its former national sales manager, J. David Smith,
has been charged by federal prosecutors with taking kickbacks in New
Jersey. GTech has never been charged with a crime and says it was
victimized by Smith, who is vigorously defending himself. Nonetheless,
critics are calling for a reexamination of GTech's role in Camelot.
   Scamalot will make even more headlines when the inquiry starts probing
Branson's allegations. The way things are going, Camelot's partners may
come to regret that they ever bet on this business.

TOSSING A LIFELINE TO MEXICO'S BIGGEST BANKS
Even Banamex and Bancomer are getting a state bailout

By:
By Geri Smith in Mexico City


Mexico's yearlong economic crisis has been murder on the country's banking
system. The government has been forced to take over six banks and bail out
nine others. But the prevailing wisdom was always that the system's crown
jewels, Banamex and Bancomer, would easily weather the storm. Now they,
too, are in sufficient distress that the government is preparing to assume
chunks of their troubled loan portfolios--and those of two other banks. The
cost: More than $4 billion on top of the $11 billion the government has
already spent on bailouts. The government effort has already grown so
massive that some critics are saying that the banks are being
renationalized.
   It's a stunning reversal. Just four years ago, the government made $13.5
billion selling off the state-controlled banks to some of Mexico's cockiest
entrepreneurs. They plunked down an average of three times book value for
18 banks, figuring that the economic reforms of then President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari, coupled with free trade with the U.S., would guarantee
vigorous economic growth and handsome profits.
SICK SYSTEM. Instead, the new owners have seen the value of their holdings
devastated by the high interest rates and bad loans that are the hallmarks
of the financial crisis. With borrowers unable to pay, past-due loans now
exceed $17 billion--18% of the system's portfolio. If tougher U.S.
accounting standards were applied, the figure would be as high as
35%--meaning the system is very sick. One big loser is financier Agustin
Legoretta III, whose investor group has lost nearly all the $1.4 billion it
paid for Grupo Financiero Inverlat--now a ward of the state.
   The banks' problems present a big threat to President Ernesto Zedillo
Ponce de Leon's pledges that the economy will recover in 1996. The country
needs healthy banks to finance any recovery. Yet, Standard & Poor's Corp.
says Mexican banks won't start to turn around until the third quarter of
1996 because banks and borrowers are still being hit by 50% interest
rates.
   The worry is that Mexico's banking problems will be a drag on the
economy for years. Moody's Investors Service warns that the bank bailout
could cost 10% to 15% of GDP, or up to $40 billion. That would slow growth
and suck Mexican and international funding away from other uses. With many
economists expecting the economy to shrink in early 1996, the government
may have to step in with more money soon. ``The government is providing
Band-Aids to the banks as they come for help, but the real cancer--the
past-due loans--has not been eliminated,'' says economist Rogelio Ramirez
de la O.
   The government doesn't have any easy way out of this mess. Confidence in
Mexico is so low that if the government tries to help the banks by bringing
rates down, the markets will likely pummel the peso and Mexican securities.
That's what happened last fall when market jitters forced an upward spike
in rates, producing a flurry of new defaults.
WARY INVESTORS. In October, Standard & Poor's downgraded Banamex' peso debt
to BBB-, S&P's lowest investment-grade rating. In response, the loan-buyout
program, previously used to help smaller banks, was extended to Banamex and
Bancomer, which together control 39% of the system's assets. ``Banamex and
Bancomer are the most important banks in Mexico, and we simply can't run
the risk that their finances might deteriorate,'' says Eduardo Fernandez,
president of Mexico's Banking & Securities Commission.
   The banks' troubles present a buying opportunity for foreign
banks--though most are wary of getting entangled in a Mexican bank now. But
Spain's Banco Bilbao Vizcaya paid $340 million to buy control of troubled
Mercantil Probursa in July. Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia is negotiating to
assume control of Inverlat. And Bancomer is shopping around for a foreign
minority investor to inject fresh capital.
   As they grapple with the banks' problems, Mexican officials now concede
that they mishandled the bank sell-off in the early 1990s. Too much
emphasis was placed on obtaining high prices and too little emphasis on the
banking skills of the buyers. ``In retrospect, I would have applied some of
the purchase price to better capitalization of the banks,'' says Finance
Secretary Guillermo Ortiz, who was in charge of the privatization program
then and is responsible for bailing the banks out now. He is probably
doomed to spend a long time correcting his mistake.

APPLE: ANOTHER BOUT OF BAD TIDINGS
Profit pressure may bring layoffs and suitors

By:
By Peter Burrows, with Kathy Rebello, in San Francisco and Steve Brull in
Tokyo


Mike Spindler just can't get a break. Instead of celebrating the blowout
sales he expected this Christmas quarter, Apple Computer Inc.'s CEO is
bracing for a very rough ride. In mid-December, the company warned of a
possible loss during the period, and analysts fear the worst--layoffs,
projects killed, maybe more losses. Some even say Apple will have little
choice but to sell off parts, if not all, of the business. And there are
again rumors that Spindler's job is in jeopardy. Says Robertson, Stephens &
Co. analyst John T. Rossi, who doesn't foresee profits again until next
fall: ``Apple is in a tougher spot than it's been in for a long time.''
   The reason? Banking on a strong season, Apple pumped up production by
about 30%. To move its many Macintosh models, the company slashed prices.
Simultaneously, it faced a shortage of profitable high-end models. To make
matters worse, Apple was slammed by a vicious price war in Japan. The net
result: On Dec. 15, Apple announced that its unit sales and revenue for the
Christmas quarter were running above last year's level but below internal
forecasts. Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. analyst Eugene G. Glazer now expects
Apple to report a $5 million loss for the quarter, down from a $178 million
profit on sales of $2.8 billion for the same quarter a year ago. Glazer
figures Apple's gross margins for the period slipped to a tiny 18.2%.
CREDIT WATCH. Apple has gained market share worldwide, hitting 9.3% of the
PC market this fall, up from 7.9% at midyear, figures New York-based
researcher Link/IDC. Apple execs see the share improvement as critical,
maintaining that software developers--and then customers--will abandon the
Mac if it loses more ground to PC rivals. But to make its market-share
gains, Apple sacrificed profitability--and its long-held tenet that
consumers are willing to pay a premium for its computers. Recent price cuts
narrowed the gap between Macs and PCs from $1,000-plus in 1994 to $320, IDC
figures.
   Apple isn't giving up on its strategy. It recently sweetened discounts
to big resellers with $20 million worth of Mac sales a year. And dealers
say Apple will cut prices 10% again in January on some PowerBook laptops
and high-end 9500 Power Macs. But outsiders worry that Apple can't afford
its crusade. Analysts figure Apple's cash balance is down to $200 million.
Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Services started reviews of Apple's
credit on Dec. 18.
   That makes internal cost-cutting crucial. Insiders say between 1,000 and
2,000 employees--7% to 15% of the workforce--could be let go before
quarterly results come out on Jan. 17. More manufacturing also may be
outsourced, and nascent businesses--such as multimedia set-top boxes--may
be sold or axed.
   Some outsiders contend even that won't do it. Glazer says slashing 1,500
jobs translates into $100 million in yearly savings, vs the $450 million he
thinks Apple needs to reach Compaq Computer Corp.'s 23.5% gross margins and
earn its 10% net. To fuel development of the Mac alone, Apple spends about
5.6% of sales on R&D, vs. 1.8% for Compaq.
   Spindler engineered Apple out of a similar crisis in 1993, when he laid
off 13% of the workforce and took a one-time quarterly loss of $188
million. Can he do it again? With gross margins way down, he has less room
to maneuver. Thanks to a bloody price war started by Fujitsu Ltd., Apple's
Japanese unit, normally the source of 30% of the company's profits, will be
lucky to break even this quarter, analysts in Japan say.
   Despite rumors, insiders think it's unlikely Spindler will get the boot
at Apple's scheduled board meeting in mid-January. ``The board stands
behind the statement in October in support of Michael Spindler,'' says a
director.
TROIKA TALES. Apple's troubles, meanwhile, have lowered its share price by
34% since mid-July, to about $32--not far above the company's book value of
$23.50. That has made Apple takeover bait. Two new suitors said to be
sniffing around: Sun Microsystems and a three-way partnership of Apple
co-founder Steve Jobs, who left in 1985; Lawrence Ellison, CEO of software
giant Oracle; and Jim Manzi, former chief of Lotus Development, the
software company recently taken over by IBM.
   Sun execs won't comment on rumors, though Eric E. Schmidt, its chief
technology officer, calls Apple ``a strong brand.'' As for the troika? No
way, says Jobs: ``The rumor ain't true. Though there might be romance in
the idea, I'm afraid one can't go home again.'' The question: How much
breathing room does Spindler have left?

THE COMEBACK KID OF RUSSIA?
Yeltsin has no charismatic rival, and the economy looks better

By:
By Peter Galuszka in Moscow


On election day, voters thronged to the brick school building that served
as the voting place in precinct 1465--a working-class Moscow neighborhood.
One of the voters favoring the Communists--the big winners--was 83-year-old
Maria Artshenava. In her youth, the Communists brought stability and pride,
she said. Today's market reformers have brought only pain. With a pension
of only $45 a month, ``all I can buy is bread,'' she complained.
   For the second time in two years, Russian voters have given President
Boris Yeltsin the same message: Reforms have enriched just a sliver of
Russian society while impoverishing the rest. At the same time, Russia's
superpower status, achieved under the old regime, has collapsed. That's why
voters made the revived Communist Party the leaders, with 22% of the
parliamentary vote. Ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky's misnamed
Liberal Democratic Party did better than predicted, coming in second.
   It is certainly a disappointing outcome for Yeltsin and the whole reform
camp. But it is not quite a disaster. Indeed, Yeltsin will even find some
encouraging nuggets in the results as he ponders his strategy for the far
more important June presidential elections. Yeltsin hasn't yet declared
whether he will be a candidate in that crucial vote, which will choose a
leader for a five-year term.
FALLING FLAT. As he mulls his options, the Russian President will note with
satisfaction that the parliamentary elections have not produced a
charismatic challenger for the presidency. Grigory Yavlinski, the only
reformer with much popularity, gained just 9% of the votes. Yeltsin's most
feared rival, Alexander Lebed, the nationalist former general, fell flat on
his face. His party received less than the 5% minimum for parliamentary
representation.
   While Yeltsin will face a strong campaign from the resurgent Communists,
their leader, Gennady Zyuganov, is a bumbling-professor type who lacks
charisma. Says Nikolai Petrov, a senior analyst at the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace in Moscow: ``This does improve Yeltsin's chances.
There's danger from the Communists and nationalists, but he'll get a chance
to mobilize the democratic electorate.''
   The big question is Yeltsin's health. If he is able to run in June, he
will likely enjoy the heavy backing of the financial and business groups
his policies have enriched as well as the old military and industrial
elite. But if he takes himself out of the race, the reformers could
split--opening the way for Zyuganov or Zhirinovsky.
   There is also concern that the Communist resurgence may frighten Yeltsin
into abandoning his relatively austere economic program. Such a move could
be self-defeating if inflation, which he has chopped from 2,000% in 1992 to
around 170% for 1995, shoots up again.
   But Yeltsin should be able to hold the line on reform. Although the
Communists are likely to pick up at least 150 of the Duma's 450 seats and
Zhirinovsky did surprisingly well, with more than 50 members, the
President's powers are much greater than those of the Duma. Moreover, any
Communist effort to roll back reform will be hurt by the poor showing of
their allies, the Agrarians, a group led by collective farm managers, who
dread privatization of agriculture. They only won about 20 seats. Finally,
the Communists and Zhirinovsky disagree on economics. The otherwise erratic
Zhirinovsky tends to support sound fiscal policies.
   Yeltsin is not acting as if he's going to cave in to his rivals. Moscow
insiders say he will likely ditch unpopular Foreign Minister Andrey V.
Kozyrev. But key aides such as Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin and
privatization chief Anatoly Chubais are likely to stay on.
   If Yeltsin can hang on until June, he may be helped by real economic
improvement. With inflation down and the ruble relatively stable, the
indications are that economic output is likely to rise in 1996 for the
first time in six years. Russians are no longer seeing their savings eaten
away to the degree they were two years ago. By June, they may see more
Russian goods on the shelves and perhaps more competitive pricing. While
such changes may not win the votes of big losers such as Maria Artshenava,
they could be enough to gain Yeltsin another five years.

NO SMOKE, BUT PLENTY OF HEAT
Why the smokeless tobacco biz is starting to hack

By:
By Tim Smart, with Ed Brown, in New Haven


For years, UST Inc. has chewed up the competition and spit out pure gold.
Partly because the Greenwich (Conn.) maker of Skoal and Copenhagen brand
snuffs has avoided the political and legal hassles that have plagued
cigarette companies, it has posted profit numbers most consumer-products
outfits can only dream about. Earnings have doubled in five years, to $387
million last year--enough to generate a hefty 32% net margin on $1.2
billion in sales.
   Now, UST may be about to get chewed up. A study released on Dec. 18 by
the American Health Foundation, a Valhalla (N.Y.) organization that focuses
on research about the health hazards of tobacco, found that a single can of
smokeless tobacco contains three times the dosage of cancer-causing
chemicals found in a pack of cigarettes. (The average user of smokeless
tobacco consumes three cans per week.) In Kansas, a team of lawyers is
preparing a nationwide class action alleging that UST and others have known
for years that their products are addictive and harmful. Meanwhile, tobacco
has until Jan. 2 to respond to Food & Drug Administration proposals that
would sharply curtail marketing of smokeless tobacco.
TRIPLE WHAMMY. Perhaps more ominously, UST's fundamental business is
changing for the worse. Analysts expect profits to increase by 11% in 1996,
but much of the rise will come from higher prices. Unit-sales growth for
UST's smokeless tobacco through the first nine months of this year was a
paltry 0.5%--after increases of 2.6% in 1994 and 2.3% in 1993 and twice
those rates in the 1980s. From about 90% in the late 1980s, UST's market
share has fallen to about 84%.
   The problem: UST's traditional market of mostly young blue-collar males
isn't expanding. Attempts to lure new buyers to smokeless tobacco--mainly
former cigarette smokers or younger users--have failed. Competitors,
meanwhile, have begun chipping away at UST. Swisher International Inc.'s
Helme unit offers its Silver Creek brand in a two-for-one package, while
Conwood Co. is selling its new Cougar brand for about half the price of
UST's Skoal.
   UST is fighting back, but slowly. It recently unveiled Skoal Flavor
Packs, a pouch-like version of Skoal designed as an alternative to
cigarettes. But similar products have had only limited success with their
target market: cigarette smokers. Meanwhile, Joseph R. Taddeo, head of
UST's tobacco unit, resigned in June after a dispute with CEO Vincent A.
Gierer Jr.--analysts say over the course of new-product initiatives.
Taddeo's replacement is marketing executive Robert D. Rothenberg. Gierer,
Rothenberg, and other company executives refused interview requests.
   Analysts expect Rothenberg to further shift UST's advertising emphasis
away from stock-car racing and rodeo audiences to rock concerts and college
campuses. Advertising spending is going up, too. One splashy promotion is
UST's Rock The Smokies campaign, which offers a drawing for free tickets to
a country-music concert to be held on Fourth of July weekend in Newport,
Tenn. Anyone who sends in a coupon can ask for free samples of UST
products.
   But aggressive marketing could easily ignite more opposition from
activists and regulators. ``Statistics show that it's young people that
start using tobacco, not adults,'' says Mitchell R. Zeller, a deputy
associate commissioner at the FDA. ``It's the President's goal that the
next generation grow up without becoming addicted to tobacco.'' The new FDA
rules would limit marketing efforts such as sponsorships and the handing
out of free samples. The agency also is likely to pressure UST and stores
to ensure that they don't sell to minors.
I.D., PLEASE? Some states aren't waiting for Washington. In October,
Massachusetts forced UST to consent to stringent restrictions on the use of
mail-order samples there, including checking driver's licenses to verify
the age of those writing in for samples. This came after a six-month sting
in which the state had minors clip coupons in Rolling Stone and other
magazines, then write for free samples after claiming to be adults. ``If
you could fill out a coupon and sign something without showing any proof of
age and get a six-pack of beer in the mail, people would be outraged,''
says Assistant Attorney General George Weber.
   Diversification would seem prudent at this point. UST got into
winemaking in the mid-1980s under the Chateau Ste. Michelle and Columbia
Crest labels, but wine still only accounts for 7% of sales and 1.3% of
operating profits, hardly enough to offset pressures on its main business.
UST may have to come up with something else--or endure some bites into its
peerless financial record.

WILL FLIPPER PLAY IN ESTONIA?
Why John Kluge is on a buying binge in Hollywood

By:
By Ronald Grover in Los Angeles


John W. Kluge didn't get to be one of the richest men in America by being
stupid. A onetime Ford assembly-line worker, he invested in a Washington
radio station in 1946 and later a string of TV stations. That made his
fortune in a big way in 1984, when he sold the TV stations to Rupert
Murdoch for $2 billion. He was among the first to jump into cellular,
too--picking up a cell-phone operation in 1983, which he sold three years
later for a cool $1.6 billion.
   Yet for all his lucrative dealmaking, the 81-year-old Kluge has never
managed to conquer Hollywood. He has lost an estimated $275 million on
Orion Pictures Corp., the production outfit he began investing in during
the mid-1980s--only to see it sink into bankruptcy. Orion emerged from
Chapter 11 in 1992, but it still gushes red ink. So why would Kluge's
Metromedia International Group Inc. swoop in on Dec. 21 to bid $115 million
for debt-plagued Samuel Goldwyn Co.? Or, among other apparently oddball
deals, agree on Nov. 30 to pay an estimated $533 million for Alliance
Entertainment Corp., a distributor of golden-oldie music by the likes of
Mel Torme and Rosemary Clooney? The answer: Eastern Europe.
PICK OF SHOWS. Since the Berlin Wall came down, Kluge and his aides have
been aggressively buying up licenses to provide wireless cable TV, radio,
and telephones in such places as Riga, Tallinn, and Nizhny Novgorod. Now,
Kluge's troops are hustling to line up the programming they intend to sell
to these new customers. If it outbids Dutch media giant Polygram for the
Samuel Goldwyn studio, Metromedia will gain the rights to a library of
1,100 films, including such classics as Guys and Dolls and Pride of the
Yankees, as well as some 700 episodes of TV programs such as Flipper and
Gentle Ben.
   Will they line up in Estonia to see Flipper? Hard to say. But Kluge and
company certainly think so. In a flurry of deals since August, 1994,
Metromedia has also snapped up two smallish film companies. If you add in
Orion and Goldwyn, the deals would give Metromedia rights to more than
2,100 films and television shows.
   One problem: Much of Kluge's new empire isn't making any money. In a
recent filing with the Securities & Exchange Commission, Metromedia
acknowledged that its collection of companies lost $51.2 million in the
first six months of 1995, on sales of $179.9 million. Moreover, the company
is clogged with $399 million in short-term and long-term debt.
   Kluge isn't talking about how he intends to turn his money-losers
around. And he shows no sign of altering his strategy. Associates say
Metromedia continues to bid for licenses not only in Eastern Europe but
also in Asia. The company already ships such U.S. programs as MTV, Country
Music Television, and the Discovery Channel to wireless cable-TV
subscribers in such cities as Moscow, Bucharest, and Tashkent. It also owns
radio stations in Moscow, Budapest, and elsewhere, and is building wireless
phone systems in other regions.
   Looking for financial stability, last April Kluge merged Metromedia with
Actava Group Inc., a mishmash of companies formerly known as Fuqua
Industries. Its chairman, John D. Phillips, is a 52-year-old turnaround
specialist who has sold off everything but Actava's Snapper Power Equipment
unit. An executive whose tastes run to denim and Harley Davidsons, Phillips
will act as CEO of Kluge's entertainment companies from from Actava's
Atlanta headquarters.
   As a source of new programming, Kluge is counting on Motion Picture
Corp. of America (MPCA), a production house he agreed on Nov. 27 to buy for
$32.5 million in stock and cash. MPCA, which produced such low-budget hits
as Dumb and Dumber and Threesome, plans to turn out 14 to 16 films next
year for Metromedia. If Metromedia wins Goldwyn, which specializes in art
films such as The Madness of King George, it would get ownership of a dozen
other films in the works, including American Buffalo with Dustin Hoffman.
   Can a library of movies and some startup production help put Kluge's
entertainment biz in the black? Possibly. More likely, they will keep him
in the game long enough to make back the losses from his Orion debacle--and
find another, bigger company to buy him out. After all, some of John
Kluge's shrewdest moves have come from knowing when to sell.



KLUGE'S MEDIA EMPIRE

ORION PICTURES Has a film library of 1,200 movies, including Platoon,
Terminator, and Silence of the Lambs. Emerged from bankruptcy in late 1992.
Lost $18.9 million on $73 million in revenues for the six months ended Aug.
31.

METROMEDIA INTERNATIONAL Provides wireless cable TV, paging, and telephone
services to Eastern Europe and former Soviet-bloc nations. Lost $13.1
million on $3.3 million in sales for the first six months of fiscal 1996.

SAMUEL GOLDWYN* Owns a 52-theater chain and a library of 1,100 films,
including Pride of the Yankees and Guys and Dolls, and 700 TV episodes. It
also has film production and distribution. Lost $12.3 million on sales of
$53.5 million in the six months ended Sept. 30.

THE NAACP BETS ON A NEW BREADWINNER
Kweisi Mfume hopes to show donors the crisis is over

By:
By Susan B. Garland in Washington


Last March, officials of the scandal-plagued National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People asked members of the AT&T Foundation to lunch
at Manhattan's Remi restaurant. Myrlie Evers-Williams, who had just taken
over as NAACP chair, quickly got down to business. What could the nation's
venerable civil rights organization do to persuade the foundation to renew
a three-year, $225,000 education grant that had expired in 1993? AT&T's
answer: Put your house in order. ``We were looking for strong leadership,
strong financial controls, and a strong mission,'' recalls Milton J.
Little, an AT&T Foundation vice-president who was at the meeting.
   Enter Representative Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.). On Feb. 15, Mfume will leave
Congress to become president and CEO of the NAACP, a move that figures to
bolster its clout--and its bottom line. Already, his appointment may have
won over one big donor: On Dec. 28, Nissan Motor Corp. USA is expected to
announce it will donate $100,000 to the NAACP. The organization's backers
hope others will follow. ``We wanted someone whose integrity was
first-rate,'' says Nancy L. Lane, director of corporate affairs for Johnson
& Johnson, who served on the NAACP's search committee.
DAUNTING TASK. Mfume's challenges are twofold: He must attract young blacks
now drawn to militant leaders like Louis Farrakhan while reassuring
Corporate America that the NAACP is worthy of support. ``We need to change
the hearts, minds, and direction of young people so that they see
appreciation of work, respect for elders, and individual responsibility as
bedrock principles,'' he says.
   Mfume thinks this message of self-reliance will appeal to donors. ``I
hope corporate partners who have not shied away will say to others that
it's all right to come home to the NAACP,'' he says. The task is daunting.
The 87-year-old organization has been reeling since August, 1994, when it
ousted Executive Director Benjamin F. Chavis Jr. after discovering he had
paid $300,000 to settle a sexual-harassment suit. Auditors found other
evidence of gross financial mismanagement. The scandal led to longtime
Chairman William F. Gibson's defeat last February to Evers-Williams.
   Mfume is meeting with auditors to come up with fiscal controls for the
group, which is $3.8 million in debt. He hopes to build a $150 million
endowment by 2001, improve efficiencies by merging regional offices, and
ask some suppliers to restructure or forgive debt.
   Business, which contributed almost half of the NAACP's 1995 budget of
$8.5 million, is key to his efforts. Despite financial disarray, many
companies, including Procter & Gamble, Sears, Quaker Oats, and IBM, have
kept up support. Companies argue that business has an interest in backing
groups that promote minority opportunities. ``It's important we have a
skilled and qualified workforce,'' says Eric R. Graves, manager of
constituency affairs at Texaco Inc.
   Other corporate donors couldn't ignore the disorder. In 1995, corporate
giving declined some 30% from 1994. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons Inc. withheld
its annual $50,000 grant in 1994 and 1995. Seagram spokeswoman Patsy Glazer
says the company had been waiting to see who would head the organization.
Now, she wants to meet with Mfume. Merrill Lynch & Co. also is withholding
support until it sees how the NAACP's game plan shapes up. AT&T is waiting,
too, but Little is hopeful: ``We believe Mr. Mfume's leadership is what is
needed.''
SALES TOUR. Backers say Mfume proved his leadership mettle as a member of
the House Banking Committee. There, he emerged as a consensus-builder,
mediating disputes among the banking, insurance, and securities industries.
Says Banking Committee Chairman James A. Leach (R-Iowa): ``There are some
people who think that what's good for the free market is bad for
lower-income people. Kweisi believes the reverse--that what makes the
market work will be better for lower-income people.''
   That philosophy is behind Mfume's plans to set up NAACP mentoring
programs to match students with corporate volunteers. He also wants to work
with companies to set up apprenticeship programs and with officials to
improve public schools. He may also push for incentives to encourage
corporations to work with small minority companies.
   Over the next few weeks, Mfume intends to embark on a nationwide tour to
meet with corporate leaders. But with the NAACP's programs barely
functioning, many branch offices virtually closed, and one-third of its
staff on furlough, the organization could be a tough sell. It will take all
of Mfume's skills as bridge-builder to convince Corporate America that the
NAACP won't be just another bad investment on corporate books.

REPACKAGING THE POST OFFICE
Facilities are getting face-lifts, clerks are getting friendlier

By:
By Mark Lewyn in Washington


When retired CIA analyst William R. Dodge stopped at Furr's supermarket in
Albuquerque on Dec. 22, his shopping list included butter, chocolate chips,
nuts, and postage stamps. Stamps? Sure. Overnight delivery, too. The
Albuquerque facility is one of eight that the U.S. Postal Service recently
has tucked inside popular retail outlets around the country.
   The new offices are just one sign that the USPS is trying to reinvent
itself. Aside from opening facilities in outlets such as Furr's and Kmart,
it is sprucing up old offices and improving customer service.
Stamps--including new, self-adhesive ones--can now be purchased at ATMs, by
phone, and with credit cards. During the holidays, sales clerks directed
traffic and branch hours were extended. Workers even dressed as Santa to
deliver Express Mail.
   Why the changes? After all, the agency is flush from last year's rate
hike, higher mail volume, and better cost controls and cash management.
Postmaster General Marvin T. Runyon says he ended fiscal 1995 with a record
surplus of $1.77 billion on revenue of $54.3 billion. But in many markets,
the Postal Service is losing out to private carriers and new technologies
such as fax machines (chart). ``We just can't sit here and say to people,
`Here are our hours and, if you feel like it, bring your mail to us,'''
says Runyon. ``We need to get [market share] back.''
   The new approach was evident over the holidays. Runyon hired 40,000
part-time workers to sort mail, leased 116 planes to carry it, and set up a
command center in Washington to make sure it got through. The effort seems
to have worked: On Dec. 20, 1995's busiest mail day, the service delivered
a record 725 million pieces of mail, up 6% from 1994.
   To publicize the reforms, Runyon hiked his ad budget 50% in 1995, to
$143 million. Last fall, he also hired Loren E. Smith, a former Citibank
executive who did stints at Kraft General Foods Inc. and Colgate-Palmolive
Co., to oversee marketing.
   At the heart of the new strategy are the new postal ``stores.'' So far,
200 of the 40,000 local offices have had face-lifts that include attractive
lighting and salesclerks trained to be friendly and helpful. It's looking
good: On average, the new shops have posted 20% sales gains over the
offices they replaced. Now, Smith is stepping up the pace--all postal
facilities in Albuquerque and Atlanta are getting makeovers. Philadelphia;
Columbus, Ohio; Boston; and Richmond, Va., are next. New services include
phone debit cards and a ``Pack-and-Send'' wrapping service.
   Shoppers who endured surly postal service and long lines over the
holidays likely are skeptical of such reforms. But Runyon knows he has to
make the strategy work--or see a lot less mail with a USPS postmark.

A HEAVYWEIGHT CONTENDER
This breakthrough may be the key to a fat pill

By:
By Geoffrey Smith in Boston

Last July, Amgen Inc. looked like it had a lock on one of the drug
industry's most heated races: the search for a ``fat drug.'' In a
much-heralded study whose announcement boosted Amgen's stock by $900
million, researchers disclosed that a protein called leptin, produced by
the newly discovered OB gene, stripped away body fat when injected into
obese mice.
   Barely five months later, an Amgen rival may have taken the lead: On
Dec. 28, Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., was to
announce that it had found the ``receptor'' for leptin--the structure on
cell walls that is a crucial part of regulating leptin's function.
Receptors don't make anyone skinny, but many drugs target receptors to
inhibit or stimulate a bodily function. While Amgen is testing an
injectable drug, Millennium says its receptor may be the key to an
antiobesity pill, which would be far more lucrative.
MIND-SET. Researchers had hoped a shortage of leptin--the protein that
signals the brain to stop eating--was a big factor in obesity. But studies
now show that obese people often have high leptin levels. Millennium
believes the receptor it found will lead it to another obesity gene, called
DB, that determines whether the brain can recognize leptin's stop-eating
signal. ``The receptor may lead to drugs for potentially the most prevalent
form of human obesity--one resulting from the brain's resistance to leptin
rather than the lack of leptin,'' says Millennium CEO Mark Levin.
   Weight-watchers shouldn't rethink New Year's resolutions yet:
Researchers say a wonder drug is years away.

EXHALE BLOWS 'EM AWAY

By:
EDITED BY THANE PETERSON
By Ronald Grover

Call it a Christmas miracle. No one was more surprised than execs at
Twentieth Century Fox when its Waiting to Exhale opened on Dec. 22 and
immediately became the unexpected hit of the holidays. Fox had targeted its
marketing for the film, starring singer Whitney Houston and three other
black actresses, heavily at black women. Exhale opened primarily in large
cities; the studio hardly even opened the movie in the 'burbs until after
Christmas.
Hollywood isn't sure why, but despite its segmented marketing and limited
distribution, Exhale is knocking 'em dead. The film, based on a novel by
Terry McMillan, was made on a budget of $15 million, about half the
Hollywood average. In its opening weekend, the movie had a huge $14.3
million box office, beating out six other new films, including Warner
Bros.' Grumpier Old Men and Universal Pictures' Sudden Death. Being one of
the few women-oriented films helped. Whatever other reasons for Exhale's
success, Hollywood won't ignore the lesson: Look for a wave of black-female
buddy movies --glitzier, big-budget ones.

WITH THE RENTAL CAR BUSIness wrapping up one of its worst years ever,
Budget Rent a Car's new chairman, Jack Frazee, had a Grinch-like holiday
message for 500 salaried employees: Your services are no longer needed.
Frazee hopes to save $20 million annually by cutting 20% of the salaried

rental agency with estimated 1995 U.S. revenues of $1.5 billion. Frazee
also showed the door to his CFO and two senior vice-presidents and closed
40 unprofitable offices. Handing out pink slips over the holidays was ``not

Good thing Steve Jobs knows the ups and downs of entrepreneurship. His
company, Pixar Animation Studios, maker of Toy Story, went public on Nov.
29, sending the stock to 39. Then Pixar fell to 23 on worries that the bulk

ARTHUR LEVITT SPEAKS SOFTLY AND CARRIES A LITTLE STICK

By:
EDITED BY DOUGLAS HARBRECHT
By Amy Barrett, with Michael Schroeder

When President Clinton unexpectedly vetoed a securities-litigation reform
bill on Dec. 19, it marked a setback for Securities & Exchange Commission
Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. The SEC chief had toiled for months to forge a
compromise that satisfied Republicans' desire to curb nuisance suits and
the Administration's insistence on protection for small investors. Congress
overrode the veto, but the debacle dealt a blow to Levitt's dream of
becoming a consensus-builder able to bridge the gulf on Capitol Hill.
   Because the veto blindsided GOP lawmakers, Levitt comes off looking
ineffectual. White House pols seeking favor with the trial lawyers' lobby
swayed the President, rather than Levitt. And Levitt's O.K. of a
``safe-harbor'' section of the bill that protects companies from suits over
false projections riled consumer groups. ``Levitt's credibility has been
deeply wounded by playing politics,'' says Michael A. Calabrese, a director
of Congress Watch and an opponent of the bill.
BIT PLAYER? Levitt, 64, former chairman of the American Stock Exchange, was
viewed as a savvy regulator when Clinton appointed him in 1993. Since the
Republican takeover of Congress, he has skillfully courted GOP legislators.
His modus operandi: seizing chances to get with the Republicans'
deregulatory program. For example, after winning GOP concessions on the
safe-harbor provision of the securities-reform measure--including the
exclusion of such protection for initial public offerings--Levitt signed
off on that portion of the bill. High-tech companies with volatile stock
prices had sought the change to reduce their exposure to costly lawsuits.
   While Levitt contends he would have opposed the legislation if the
safe-harbor provision had not been modified, critics grumble that he chose
to blink rather than duke it out with Republicans. ``I was stunned,'' says
former SEC Commissioner Richard Y. Roberts, a Republican, of Levitt's
position.
   More surprising, though, was Levitt's nonrole in the President's veto
decision. Clinton relied mainly on longtime Arkansas adviser Bruce Lindsey
and Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes in arriving at his no-go decision.
Levitt, for his part, insists his views were well known to the White
House.
   The perception that Levitt was a bit player in the affair could hurt
next year when the House will consider paring back securities regulations.
Rather than mounting an all-out assault on the bill's objectionable
provisions, the SEC chief is trying to win a place at the negotiating table
while pushing to eliminate overlapping state and federal regulations. Yet
with Levitt's White House clout now in question, the bill's sponsors may be
less inclined to make concessions.
   Levitt's efforts to protect his agency's funding could also take a hit.
So far, his accommodating approach has paid off. Republicans who have
savaged other regulatory agencies are expected to hold the SEC budget
steady at $300 million in 1996. But Congress could well make another run at
the regulator's budget next year, while Levitt appears weakened.
   Despite his recent wounding, Levitt shows no signs of a retreat from his
agenda. He still intends to pressure the National Association of Securities
Dealers to reform the NASDAQ market and make it more equitable for small
investors. And the SEC chief is about to unveil a proposal to require more
disclosure of derivative holdings, which could greatly complicate
companies' public filings. ``I expect flak from all quarters,'' Levitt says
serenely. But his success in dodging the next round of artillery shells may
determine the legacy Levitt leaves behind at an embattled SEC.

JAPAN'S SHADOW KINGMAKER IS BIDDING FOR THE SPOTLIGHT

By:
EDITED BY STANLEY REED
By Brian Bremner in Tokyo

Ichiro Ozawa has always preferred the role of shadow kingmaker in Japanese
politics. Back in 1993, the brash political heavyweight helped lead a mass
defection from the then ruling Liberal Democratic Party, snapping its
38-year reign. When his reformist government collapsed in 1994, Ozawa
pulled off an improbable merger of nine parties into an opposition bloc
called the New Frontier Party but didn't take the top leadership post.
   Now, Ozawa, 53, has emerged from the shadows. In mid-December, he
announced a surprise bid to challenge longtime colleague Tsutomu Hata to
lead New Frontier. And when the results were tallied on Dec. 27, Ozawa won
by more than 2 to 1. The stage is now set for an epic battle between Ozawa
and LDP President and International Trade & Industry Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto in a general election sometime in 1996. At stake will be control
of the Diet's 511-seat lower house and the Prime Minister's chair.
``AS VAGUE AS POSSIBLE.'' Ozawa's bid for the spotlight is timely. After
four years of economic stagnation and a string of bank failures, the
Japanese public is fed up with the Socialist-LDP government's dysfunctional
management of the economy. Socialist Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's
coalition is coming under withering attack for a plan to use $6.6 billion
in public money to bail out seven insolvent housing-loan corporations,
which made reckless real estate loans in the 1980s. ``The intent is to be
as vague as possible about the assignment of blame,'' Ozawa told BUSINESS
WEEK. ``This is the kind of society Japan has become.''
   Ozawa wants to remake the Japanese system. He champions sweeping
deregulation. He also wants to give the now weak Prime Minister's office
enough power to set clear policy directions. Japan's glacial
consensus-style decision-making threatens to consign the nation to decline,
he warns. ``No leader has come up with a strong vision of how to go
forward,'' he says.
   Ozawa's biggest liability aside from heart problems is his association
with the money politics he says he wants to clean up. After all, he was a
key LDP fund-raiser and power broker for years. He is taking heat right now
for his ties to a Buddhist organization that turned out 6 million votes to
support Ozawa candidates in last July's Upper House elections. Ozawa's rise
could also bust up New Frontier if he can't keep Hata on board.
   Hashimoto, who made a big splash by staring down Washington in last
summer's auto talks, is much more popular than Ozawa. Still, there is
growing sentiment in Japan that Ozawa may be the only leader who can
produce significant change. ``He's very determined, and the time left for
Japan to pull out of this stagnation is limited,'' figures Masaya Miyoshi,
president of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations, or Keidanren.
   Indeed, Ozawa has won plaudits from some economists for his proposal to
halve income and corporate taxes, wipe out special-interest loopholes, and
eventually make up some of the difference by hiking Japan's sales tax from
3% to 10%. But with Japan's budget deficit projected to hit 4.2% of gross
domestic product in 1996, vs. 2.0% in the U.S., Ozawa has to be careful not
to lead Japan into a fiscal mess.
   Ozawa could also help heal strained ties with the U.S. He is a
pragmatist on trade who is well regarded in Washington. Ozawa says he is
worried that Washington has started to lose interest in Japan. He finds it
regrettable that there is a tendency in Washington ``to treat the
U.S.-Japan alliance more lightly than before.'' If Ozawa becomes Prime
Minister, that would certainly command American attention.

PRIVATIZING A BRAZILIAN GIANT

By:
EDITED BY STANLEY REED
By Ian Katz in Sao Paulo

-- Brazil's slow-moving free-market reforms are getting a fresh impetus
from the sale of Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the state-controlled mining
giant. In what's likely to be Latin America's biggest privatization, Brazil
on Dec. 20 picked a group headed by Merrill Lynch & Co. and Rothschild Inc.
from a star-studded field of competitors to manage the sale of the
government's 51% share in CVRD. The sale, set for late 1996, should fatten
state coffers by at least $5 billion.
   Privatization of CVRD will mark ``the point of no return'' for Brazil's
move away from decades of statism, says Amaury Bier, chief economist of
Citibank in Sao Paulo. Recently, investors had been growing uneasy over the
slow pace of free-market legislation in Brazil's Congress. The naming of
the sale managers shows the government ``is serious about moving ahead,''
says Ricardo Gallo, vice-president for capital markets at Bank of Boston in
Sao Paulo.
   The Merrill Lynch group will earn a 1.9% commission on CVRD's sale
price. The lucrative job drew bids from such heavyweights as Citibank, J.P.
Morgan, and Salomon Brothers. A key issue is whether to sell the
government's shares in a global public offering or auction off operations
such as mining, forestry, and transport separately. But the choice of
Merrill Lynch, which joined with CS First Boston to manage a $3 billion
stock sale of Argentine oil company YPF in 1993, indicates that Brazil
favors privatizing CVRD through a similar high-profile public offering.

HOW TO EVALUATE TAX REFORM

This is shaping up as the year of America's great tax debate. About time.
The U.S. tax system is a mess, riddled with exemptions, deductions, and
credits that serve little purpose beyond rewarding favored constituents.
The tax system is expensive for individuals and corporations to comply
with, too.
   Tax reform is already an issue in the Presidential race. A GOP
commission headed by former Representative Jack F. Kemp will soon issue
recommendations. All the main tax-writing committees plan to hold hearings
on tax reform this year. To evaluate all the competing proposals for
overhauling the byzantine tax code, ranging from a single income-tax rate
to a national sales tax, we suggest a guide that's over 200 years old: The
Wealth of Nations. Adam Smith laid out four maxims with regard to taxes in
general: certainty, convenience of payment, economy in collection--and
equality.
   The flat tax is in the forefront of tax reform, and three of Smith's
maxims--certainty, convenience of payment, and economy in collection--would
be well served by a one-rate structure. The leading proponents of a flat
tax are Hoover Institution economists Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka, and
their ideas powerfully shaped the flat-rate tax legislation of House
Majority Leader Richard K. Armey (R-Tex.). Hall and Rabushka would levy a
single 19% flat rate on wages and salaries; Armey wants to get the rate as
low as 17%. There would be no deductions, though to keep the system
somewhat progressive Hall and Rabushka exempt from income taxes $16,500 for
a married couple and $4,500 a child. Capital gains, interest, and dividends
would be exempt from taxes. Businesses would lose many deductions, although
investment spending would get an immediate 100% first-year tax write-off.
Business would pay a 19% rate on total income (17% for Armey), after
deducting wages, salaries, pensions, and costs of goods and materials.
Bottom line: a highly simplified and more efficient system where income
gets taxed only once as close as possible to its source.
   Still, even with generous up-front exemptions, an all-or-nothing
one-rate tax is less progressive. In the past decade, global economic
forces have increased income inequality. Most Americans have only one major
asset to their name: the home they bought using generous tax incentives.
Losing the mortgage-interest deduction would squeeze the middle class. A
flat tax raises other questions, such as ditching charitable deductions and
the deductibility of state and local taxes while the federal government
asks charities and local governments to assume more responsibilities.
Perhaps a ``modified,'' streamlined tax approach is called for, one based
on two or three rates and allowing for a few of the most justifiable
deductions, such as charitable contributions and home-mortgage interest.
   The good news: The gale winds of creative tax reform are sweeping
Washington. Radical simplification would go a long way toward creating a
less intrusive government and a more efficient economy. But some equity
must be preserved.

DON'T TREAD ON FREE TRADE

What will the new year bring? An agreement between the White House and
Congress to slash federal deficits for the rest of the century. Inflation
will remain subdued, and since inflation powerfully influences the stock
and bond markets, investors should enjoy decent returns. And, as our 1996
Industry Outlook makes clear (page 72), the U.S. economic expansion that
began in 1991 should continue.
   Of course, as in any forecast, a lot could go wrong. One particularly
disturbing threat to continued growth lies with the virulent voices of
economic reaction--protectionists such as Pat Buchanan and the rapidly
expanding number of politicians who know better but make sympathetic noises
to garner votes. The rallying cry of today's isolationists and their fellow
travelers may be, ``no more free-trade agreements''--not with Chile nor
with anyone else. But what they are calling for, if heeded, would lead only
to slower growth. Instead, policymakers should push hard for fewer trade
barriers--and faster economic growth.
   True enough, there are losers as well as winners from freer trade. But
trade is not a zero-sum business. It's freer trade that helped slay the
inflation dragon that terrorized the U.S. economy for much of the '70s and
'80s. White-hot foreign competition is a key reason for disinflation fast
becoming the norm in the once inflation-prone U.S. economy. Trade spurs
growth by offering entrepreneurs and companies bigger markets. U.S.
companies are getting more and more of their sales overseas. Perhaps most
important, freer trade encourages the creation and spread of new
technologies and commercial ideas. In sharp contrast, steep trade barriers
can leave an economy stagnant. Look at Latin America for much of the period
after World War II--or the former Soviet Union, for that matter.
   Isolationists are far more powerful in Europe and Japan than they are in
the U.S. Many developing nations are still maneuvering to boost exports
while protecting their home market, too. It is more important than ever
that the world's remaining superpower provide free-trade leadership. In the
tumultuous period following the end of the cold war, the most important
decision made by the Bush and Clinton Administrations and Congress was to
continue the free-trade policies America has championed since 1945. This
bet has paid enormous economic dividends in the 1990s. The bounty from
trade and stronger economic ties among nations is plentiful indeed.

NEWBORN BABIES, BAWLING MOMS
They want laws to make insurers pay for longer hospital stays

By:
By Keith H. Hammonds in New York, with bureau reports


It is likely the most reviled fiat in recent medical history: 24 hours
after childbirth, mother and baby are out the hospital door, cut off by
their insurer. ``So negligent,'' says Kathy Sargent, an expectant mother in
Westport, Conn. ``Appalling,'' says Randi Curran of San Francisco, who will
give birth this spring. ``It must be men who made up this policy.''
   Managed care has met the masses--and the masses aren't happy. Perhaps
40% of newborns currently are discharged after one day, say hospitals,
twice the number in 1990. The economics driving that shrinkage are
compelling: Childbirth is by far the most common reason Americans enter
hospitals, and reducing stays would save insurers hundreds of millions of
dollars a year. Most mothers, though, would rather stay put, and doctors
don't want medical decisions taken out of their hands. The result is ``a
rallying point for people who have bad feelings about managed care,'' says
Michael A. Maffetone, CEO of University Hospital at Stony Brook, N.Y.
STATEHOUSE ACTION. The outrage has found an outlet: In 1996, 25 states are
expected to introduce legislation that would require insurers to pay for a
48-hour inpatient stay for normal deliveries when a physician prescribes
it. Five already have passed such laws. In California, where
health-maintenance organizations pioneered the one-day stay years ago,
insurer pressure to reduce postpartum stays to 12 hours has legislators
promising a bill on Governor Pete Wilson's desk in January. Senator Bill
Bradley (D-N.J.) is amassing support for similar federal legislation.
   In this debate, pure medicine may be on the insurers' side. While some
doctors and hospitals say they're seeing more cases of jaundice and
dehydration in newborns, the hospital readmission rate for babies remains
around its traditional 2%. Several studies have found no link between
one-day stays and consequent complications. ``There is virtually no
clinical evidence that there's a technical medical necessity for an acute
medical stay of more than 24 hours,'' says A. Bruce Campbell, chief medical
officer at Aetna Health Plans.
   Insurers and HMOs have joined with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and
groups such as the American College of Nurse-Midwives to battle
minimum-stay legislation. Many hospitals, too, worry that government
remedies, while intended to give doctors and patients decision-making
power, risk setting a precedent for wide-ranging regulation of medical
practices--or simply will force insurers to cut compensation elsewhere.
   Some hospitals have devised an alternative solution: A growing number
are offering to absorb the cost of a second night's stay for mothers whose
insurers don't pay. Hospital executives say they're motivated primarily by
safety concerns, but they admit the attending publicity doesn't hurt. ``I
will not lie,'' says T.J. Padden, administrator at Box Butte General
Hospital, a 44-bed facility in rural Alliance, Neb. ``It's not a bad
marketing thing.'' Incremental costs for additional nights are low--rarely
more than $200 a night, and far lower at Box Butte. Stony Brook, the first
hospital to underwrite longer stays, says its maternity admissions are up
8% in the past six months.
FLAT FEES? The downside to this approach, say other hospital executives, is
that it ultimately could weaken their negotiating power with insurers:
Eating the cost on one procedure could encourage HMOs to cut back on
others. For now, though, the commotion may be gaining the desired effect.
Hospitals that pay for a second night say some insurers have quietly agreed
to foot the bill when patients so desire--although just one company,
Independence Blue Cross and Pennsylvania Blue Shield, has publicly
announced such a retreat.
   Ultimately, managed care likely will offer a different solution.
Insurers are starting to compensate hospitals on a flat-fee basis for many
procedures, much as Medicare does, rather than negotiating per diem rates.
As that happens, providers will take on some of the financial risk of
giving care--but also much of the decision-making power. The 24-hour stay
may yet survive, but it won't be on managed care's head.

The production index edged up during the week ended Dec. 16. Before
calculation of the four-week moving average, the index rose to 129.8, from
128.5. Increases in the seasonally adjusted output of autos, trucks, and
electric power led the advance.

The leading index was up slightly in the latest week. The unaveraged index
dropped to 262.4, from 263.1 in the previous week. Higher stock prices and
lower bond yields are signaling solid economic growth ahead.

THE WEEK AHEAD

Due to the prolonged Washington shutdown, all government release dates are
certain to be postponed.

NAPM SURVEY
Tuesday, Jan. 2, 10 a.m. -- The National Association of Purchasing
Management's business activity index probably rose to 47.8% in December,
according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by MMS
International, one of The McGraw-Hill Companies. That low reading suggests
that the industrial sector was struggling in December. For the previous
four months, the NAPM index slid below the 50% mark that signals a
shrinking factory sector. The index was 46.5% in November.

CONSTRUCTION SPENDING
Tuesday, Jan. 2, 10 a.m. -- The MMS survey expects that construction
outlays probably dropped by about 0.5% in November, after jumping 2.7% in
October. Following a surge in October, spending on public-works projects
likely fell back in November.

NEW HOME SALES
Wednesday, Jan. 3, 10 a.m. -- New single-family homes probably sold at an
annual rate of 675,000 in November, little changed from the 673,000 sales
rate in October, says the MMS report. Home buying has declined for three
consecutive months, but lower mortgage rates in 1996 could stabilize home
sales in the first quarter.

FACTORY INVENTORIES
Thursday, Jan. 4, 10 a.m. -- Factory inventories probably grew by about
0.3% in November, after a 0.4% gain in October. That's suggested by the
small increase in factory output for the month.

EMPLOYMENT
Friday, Jan. 5, 8:30 a.m. -- The MMS median forecast calls for a gain of
125,000 new nonfarm jobs in December, less than the 166,000 added in
November. However, the survey also calls for manufacturing jobs to rise by
15,000, the first increase since August. The unemployment rate probably
stood at 5.6% last month, unchanged from November's rate.

HEALING THE SOIL IN A LUSH VALLEY...BUT JUST IN TIME FOR AN URBAN FLOOD?

By:
EDITED BY HARRY MAURER
By Susan Jackson in Los Andes

Arturo Turesca likes what he sees--nothing--as he walks among his grape
arbors, peeling off dead bark and looking underneath. During the spring,
Turesca released test tubes of mealybug parasites among the 20 hectares of
vineyards he farms. He'll probably save money by using parasites instead of
pesticides to combat mealybugs, which are the worst enemies of grape
plants. And he'll make the Aconcagua Valley a healthier place.
   Why is Turesca phasing out pesticides when neither chemical-free diets
nor environmentalism are exactly at the forefront of national debate in
Chile? His agricultural muse is Maria Helena Moreira, an exuberant
51-year-old Brazilian economist who put a successful academic career on
hold to start Aconcagua Verde, an ambitious project that aims to minimize
pollution while maximizing production in this lush valley 100 kilometers
east of Santiago. Moreira, with backing from the MacArthur Foundation in
the U.S., is looking to spark a mini-revolution in the Aconcagua. ``If we
succeed, this will be the only valley in Chile that will be able to produce
large-scale in an environmentally friendly way,'' says Moreira.
   Fruit is big business in Chile. Exports equaled 18% of gross domestic
product in 1994 and have been rising in 1995. The Aconcagua, always an
agricultural area, really started booming some 20 years ago, when Chile
tore down its trade barriers. Now, nearly 70% of the valley's irrigable
land--some 35,000 hectares--is devoted to export fruit production, more
than half of it in table grapes.
   But while exports have skyrocketed, the soil has suffered, admits
Claudio Garcia, Aconcagua Valley manager for Chiquita Exportadoras Ltda.
``There's a lot of natural degradation--the soil is heavily worked by
machines and people, so it has become much less porous.'' Then there are
pesticides. Like most grape farmers, Turesca has to abide by exporters'
rules. The exporters are in turn bound by the rules of importers--mostly
the U.S.--which require that fruit be 100% pest-free. Many farmers spray
fruit with twice as many pesticides as necessary just to make sure.
   The ravages of grape monoculture began to bother Moreira during a visit
she made to Chile in 1990. Late that year, she applied, along with
sociologists and scientists from the University of California and the
University of Rio, to the MacArthur Foundation for an
international-cooperation grant. The project: to study the effects of
monoculture on the valley and figure out how to grow fruit with less damage
to the soil. A tall order for $500,000, but that's how much Moreira was
awarded in 1991, when she and a team of professors began surveying local
farmers and exporters. In November, 1995, the project was handed over to
the town of Los Andes, but Moreira has stayed on.
   So far, only a handful of producers are using Aconcagua Verde's methods,
but this is just the first year. Garcia expects the numbers to grow: ``I
would imagine that costs will drop as productivity rises,'' which happens
as soil regains its health.
   Moreira and her crew recommend that farmers let certain weeds grow under
their arbors to prevent erosion. What controls the weeds? Geese. ``They do
the mowing--and we plan to start a side business selling down for sleeping
bags and quilts,'' she says.
   When a Basque dandy bought the Aconcagua Valley in the 19th century, his
plan was to cut a mule route to Argentina through the middle of it. The
plan didn't take hold, but a century and a half later the concept of the
valley as a throughway is coming back. The main road from Santiago is going
to be widened, which will halve travel time to 45 minutes, a tempting
thought for smog-sick city dwellers longing to escape. Residential plots
are now selling for four times as much as they would as farmland.
   A proposed tunnel from Argentina could also threaten the valley's
agricultural future. Chile's congress is considering carving a tunnel
through the Andes that would serve as a bridge between the Pacific and the
Atlantic. The resulting commercial and residential development ``would doom
the valley in terms of agriculture,'' says Moreira. Cars, not
contamination, could be the valley's biggest threat.

INVESTMENT FIGURES OF THE WEEK

COMMENTARY
As the stock market's best year in two decades drew to a close, investors
took profits. After reaching a high of 5216.5 on Dec. 13, the Dow
industrials fell as low as 5059 and then rebounded to 5106 on Dec. 27. As
expected, the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates, but that
didn't count for much with bond buyers, who instead focused on the budget
impasse between President Clinton and the GOP-controlled Congress. Looking
abroad, the long-ailing Japanese and Mexican stock markets staged yearend
rallies.

GLOOMY DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN
DEPARTMENT STORES SHOW PROMISE, BUT SLUGGISH SALES COULD SINK MANY
MERCHANTS

By:
By Susan Chandler in Chicago

Consumer confidence is up, and the stock market is at record highs. But
instead of merchants expect a Darwinian shakeout in 1996. "The strong are
getting stronger. The weak are disappearing or consolidating," says Arthur
C. Martinez, chairman and chief executive of Sears, Roebuck & Co.
   Many retailers have reason to be gloomy. Retail sales rose only 4.5%
during 1995, far below the 7% annual growth common during the roaring
1980s. They're expected to rise by the same 4.5% in 1996, while profits
will remain restrained by heavy discounting.
   Roughly 15,000 retail companies sought protection from creditors in
bankruptcy court by late 1995, pushing Chapter 11 filings up 20% from 1994.
Retail economists expect even more in 1996 (chart). That's because this
latest round of financial troubles isn't just from taking on too much debt.
It's concentrated among regional retailers with outdated computer systems,
yesterday's merchandise, and aging stores. For many, liquidation may be the
only answer, says Carl E. Steidtmann, chief economist of Management
Horizons, a consulting unit of Price Waterhouse based in Columbus, Ohio.
   The trouble is, consumers just aren't spending much. Incomes are fairly
stagnant, and consumers' non-mortgage debt-to-income ratio hit an all-time
high of 19% in late 1995. What's more, baby boomers are paying more for
services, from child- to elder-care leaving them less for shopping. And
consumers have discovered that they can get hefty discounts by waiting for
sales. "Now that we've taught them to do that, we shouldn't sit around and
wonder why," says John Ronzetti vice-president of the National Retail
Federation.
KMARTS CONSTRACTION. Discounters are feeing a lot of pain. A raft of
regional chains, including Bradlees Inc, and Caldors Corp., sought Chapter
11 protection in 1995 as competition from fast-growing Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
and Target Stores intensified. The shakeout many even claim Kmart Corp.,
the nation's third-largest retailer, retail expects say. Kmart CEO Floyd
Hall, who replaced the ousted Joseph E. Antonini in June, says he will
close 70 stores in 1996, cut $300 million in costs, and continue to unload
inventory. 'The best answer to Chapter 11 [talk] is to have a solid
performance under our belt," he says.
   Easier said than done. Just ask specialty retailers, who are expecting
another drab year for apparel sales. Clothing sales are expected to grow
only 3.5% in 1996 after a 2.5% increase in 1995. St. Louis-based Edison
Brothers Stores Inc. filed for Chapter 11 in November and plans to close
500 of its 2,700 mall-based shops. Ann-Taylor Stores Corp. is heading for a
makeover after suffering a double-digit tumble in same-store sales in
1995--the result of fashion and pricing miscues in an unforgiving market,
says retail consultant Alan Millstein, who publishes the New York-based
Fashion Network Report.
HITTING THE GAS. For beleaguered catalog companies, 1996 may spell a bit of
relief. Hit by higher paper and postage costs, catalogers saw their bottom
line take a beating in 1995; Lands' End Inc. profits throught October
dropped 61%. A survey of U.S. catalogers by consultant A.T. Kearney Inc.
found 62% expect sales to increase in 1996.
   Department stores should continue to slowly regain maket share from
outlet stores and off-price retailers. Lower prices--and thinner
margins--are the key. "We've had to get our costs down to offer fashion
that's also a value," says Allan Questrom, CEO of Cincinnati-based
Federated Department Stores Inc., parent of Macy's and Bloomingdale's.
   Consumer-electronics stores are ecxpected to have another hot year, as
shoppers snap up computers and related items. That means strong revenue
growth for category killers--high-volume specialty chains such as Best Buy
Co. and Circuit City Stores Inc. But they, too, must settle for the
slimmest of margins.
   Sears seems to be getting the formula right. It's one of the last
department stores with a broad array of hard goods, such as appliances and
computers. With these products going gang-busters and its apparel share
expanding, Sears is winning market share. Says CEO Martinez: "When that
happens, you push the accelerator a little harder." But in what looks like
a treacherous 1996, many other retailers will be satisfied just to stay in
the road.



Prognosis '96

Positives
  -- Housing purchases should continue to help sales of home-related
goods.
  -- Consumer confidence is rising, and that bodes well for sales of
big-ticket items such as home computers.

Negatives
  -- Apparel sales will continue to slow as consumers focus on home-related
purchases.
  -- Retail bankruptcies will increase as the shakeout among discounters
and off-price retailers continues.
