<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>Threats:</STRONG>  <I>Unsustainable harvesting of forests; mining; and lack of in-country capacity for conservation.</I>  

<P>
The nations of Melanesia are unparalleled for the diversity
of their cultures.  Ethnic groups number into the hundreds, and
on the island of New Guinea alone, nearly 900 languages are spoken.
 One critical tradition guiding CI's conservation strategy in
many of these island cultures is a long-standing system of forest
ownership through tradition clans.  CI's strategy aims to cultivate
conservation by reinforcing the strong ties that exist between
the island people and their land.   

<P><H4>Papua New Guinea  </H4>

<P>
The eastern
half of the island of New Guinea, PNG's biodiversity can only
be described in superlatives.  It harbors over 10,000 flowering
plant species, 90 percent of which are endemic, and also boasts
the world's largest dove, grasshopper, and butterfly, and the
longest lizard.  CI is working in the Lakekamu Basin, one of PNG's
last intact expanses of lowland rainforest, with four local indigenous
groups and two NGOs to develop facilities for scientific research
and adventure ecotourism. 

<P><IMG SRC="../../../RESOURCE/SLIDES/ASIA/Child.jpg" ALT="Child.jpg - 8.7 K" WIDTH=133 HEIGHT=200 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=0 ALIGN=right>
On the island of New Britain, a region
threatened by intense forestry development, CI, indigenous landowners,
and the East New Britain Social Action Committee are creating
conservation areas supported by economic alternatives to logging.

<P>
<H4> Makira Island, the Solomon Islands</H4>

<P>
 In partnership with the
Maruia Society, the Solomon Islands Development Trust, and 35
local Makira Island communities, CI's Conservation-in-Development
program has established a conservation area of 63,000 hectares
of forest.  The partners also  operate a community-based enterprise
that exports ngali-nut oil.  Preferring CI's conservation-based
development over forest destruction, Makira Island residents rejected
logging company bids to harvest timber.   

<P>One of CI's greatest
moments in 1995 came when the 35 villages of Makira Island rejected
logging contract offers from a major corporation operating in
the region.  Armed with information on communities' experience
in other parts of the world, the Makira people didn't go for the
quick cash.  Instead, they weighed the prospect of logging versus
alternative enterprises in partnership with CI, the Maruia Society,
and the Solomon Islands Development Trust--and decided in favor
of their culture and their land. Their decision is all the more
impressive since it came before the alternatives, which include
a ngali-nut oil export business and ecotourism -- have produced
long-term economic benefits.    

<P><H4>Fiji</H4>

<P>  In 1995 CI and the Maruia
Society completed a detailed plan for conserving Sovi Basin, Fiji's
last pristine lowland rain forest. New Caledonia.   CI has supported
the review of the protected area network that will contribute
to a major rapid assessment of key forest ecosystems of New Caledonia
in 1996.

<BLOCKQUOTE><H3>Sea of Cortez</H3>  

<P>
<P>This 1,070
km long ocean trench off Baja California harbors more than 875
species of fish, 176 species of marine and coastal birds, and
 a porpoise that
is found nowhere else in the world. 

<P><IMG SRC="../../../RESOURCE/SLIDES/MESO/Pelican.jpg" ALT="Pelican.jpg - 7.4 K" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=134 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=0 ALIGN=left>The Sea of Cortez once supported
a thriving fishing fleet that provided 60 percent of Mexico's
total fish catch. Recently, though, overfishing, pollution, and
adverse climatic conditions have sharply reduced the haul.  Marine
diversity is threatened, and many local fishermen are idle.  CI
is working with those who know the seacoast the best--local fishers--to
explore economic alternatives to destructive fishing practices.
 Focusing on communities bordering the new Upper Gulf of California
Biosphere Reserve, in 1995, CI helped a number of groups--including
one women's group--set up Mexico's first scallop farms. Other
initiatives, like fishing techniques that target desired species
and let others go, are being tested. Bringing years of research
to bear, CI's staff is also designing a conservation action plan
for the entire Sea of Cortez, including the Colorado River, Midriff
Islands, wetlands, and coastal zones.   CI's public awareness
campaign promotes marine conservation in communities all along
the gulf, using innovative means like environmental comic books
and theater performances.

<BR clear=all>

<P>
<STRONG>Threats:</STRONG> <I>Overfishing and inappropriate fishing techniques; water contamination from urban areas, industry, and agriculture.
</I>
<P>
The Sea of Cortez in northwest Mexico ranks among the biologically richest one percent of all the world's ocean areas.  CI's conservation solutions in the Sea of Cortez include:





<UL>
<LI>developing a participatory management plan for the newly declared Upper Gulf of California/Colorado River Delta Biosphere Reserve;

<LI>implementing an environmental education program in local schools, communities, and with the fishing industry;

<LI>studying the effects of diminished fresh water flow from the Colorado River; and,

<H3>Selva Lacandona</H3>

<P>
The 385,000 hectare Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve protects the
largest remaining block of lowland tropical forest in Mexico.
 Though it covers a mere 0.16 percent of the nation's territory,
the reserve contains nearly 50 percent of all known species in
Mexico.

<P><IMG SRC="../../../RESOURCE/SLIDES/MESO/Kids.jpg" ALT="Kids.jpg - 5.2 K" WIDTH=131 HEIGHT=200 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=0 ALIGN=right>Since the Zapatista Revolution of early 1994, political
unrest in Chiapas has prompted land-hungry farmers to surge into
the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve and the forested lands of
the Lacandon community.  CI's biological stations in the reserve
have established a conservation presence in the region, and CI
is working with all parties--indigenous groups, settlers, and
government representatives -- to mediate land disputes.   CI staff
are also helping to create economic opportunities -- such as butterfly
ranching and new food crops -- that offer alternatives to slash-and-burn
agriculture and cattle-ranching. 
<P>
<STRONG>Threats:</STRONG> <I>Colonization; inappropriate agricultural techniques; conversion of forests for ranching and agriculture; illegal logging.</I>

In 1995 CI launched a comprehensive, three-year program to bolster
the Tambopata Candamo Reserved Zone, a 1.5 million hectare reserve
in the Peruvian Amazon.  Called &quot;Conservation Based Development
in Tambopata,&quot; or PRODESCOT, this effort comprises 16 projects
and has received funding from USAID, the Peruvian government,
and several foundations.  PRODESCOT projects underway include:
 
<P>
<H4>Land Titling and Mapping  </H4>

<P>CI used five socioeconomic surveys
in different areas to provide baseline data, point up potential
land conflicts, and establish a working relationship with local
communities.   CI financed the field work that enabled the Pukirieri
Indians to officially title their land with the Peruvian government,
so  they will be better able to fend off incursions from colonists
and miners.  And CI has been helping FADEMAD, the Madre de Dio
Farmer's Union, to collect data on soil, topography and vegetation
in more than 28 communities in and around Tambopata.  CI is organizing
the data through its computer software, CISIG, and is generating
sophisticated maps to help farmers choose economically attractive
and ecologically benign farming practices. 

<P><H4>Monitoring and Sustainable
Use of Natural Resources</H4>

<P>CI has trained local inhabitants and
park guards in seven areas in Tambopata in natural resource monitoring.
 This effort is the first in Tambopata to collect long-term data
needed for making informed decisions about natural resource management.
         

<P><H4><A HREF="../c-c_prog/consent2.htm">Conservation Enterprise</A> </H4>

<P>In the 18 months since CI financed
the purchase of a Brazil nut processing plant in Tambopata, we
have developed marketing arrangements that will ensure collectors
a source of income.   With orders from nationally known restaurants
like Subway -- the world's largest cold-sandwich chain -- and
Hard Rock Cafe, millions of Brazil nuts are now exported from
Puerto Maldonado to outlets in the United States. </BLOCKQUOTE>

The Philippines is the "hottest of the <A HREF="../hotspots/hotspots.htm">hot spots</A>," with extremely high terrestrial and marine diversity facing a very high rate of ecological destruction.  
 With more than 95 percent of primary
forest already degraded, and many marine ecosystems under threat,
CI and partners seek to address the continued pressures from development
and agricultural expansion, as well as illegal logging and fishing.
 In the Philippines, CI's experience in conservation planning,
scientific research, and enterprise development are united with
Philippine institutions' on-the-ground expertise. 

<P><H4>Palanan</H4>

<P>
 CI
works jointly with Isabela State University, the Center for Tropical
Forest Studies and with fellow members of the Northern Sierra
Madre Wilderness Foundation consortium on the conservation this
national protected area, the largest remaining block of lowland
rain forest in the Philippines.  Activities include forest ecological
research as part of a regionwide network of sites measuring growth
rate, disturbances, weather effects on tropical habitats.  The
project also explores enterprise development including ecotourism
services training for community members, and institutional development
for promoting community-based natural resource management.

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>Threats:</STRONG> <I>Logging and mining concessions; road construction;  insufficient protected areas, systems, and policies; limited economic opportunities. </I> 



<P>With
nearly 90 percent -- or 15 million hectares -- of its original
forest cover intact, Suriname harbors rich biodiversity, including
674 species of birds, 200 species of mammals, 130 reptiles, 99
amphibians, and roughly 5,000 plants.   

<P>
CI Suriname is committed
to protecting this country's remarkable stretches of pristine
rain forest, while identifying initiatives that will yield income
for its inhabitants.  By presenting options like bioprospecting
and ecotourism, CI is helping policymakers realize that they have
economic alternatives to wholesale environmental destruction.
 As a first step, CI prepared an in-depth economic analysis of
the logging companies' proposals, &quot;Backs to the Wall in Suriname.&quot;
 From this report, government and private forest experts have
concluded that Suriname would actually see only a small fraction
of anticipated revenue.  CI also sponsored a visit to Costa Rica
for the first group of Suriname Paliament members to gather information
on development options -- notably ecotourism and bioprospecting
-- that offer two potentially profitable alternatives to logging.
  
<P><IMG SRC="../../../RESOURCE/SLIDES/GUIANAS/Rainbow.jpg" ALT="Rainbow.jpg - 5.3 K" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=136 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=0 ALIGN=right>
The Suriname program is now helping design environmentally sustainable
national policies through the development of the CI-Suriname Policy
Group.  This nonpartisan group is currently exploring how to implement
Earth Summit's Agenda 21 and Biodiversity Conventions, including
how to make sure that intellectual and genetic property rights
benefit local people.  Policy decisions on these questions will
have long-term impact on Suriname's economic development and ecosystems.
CI is also active in the villages, forging conservation-based
economic development programs to benefit local communities. 

<P>
<H4> <A HREF="../../aboutci/strategy/shaman.htm">Bioprospecting</A></H4>

<P>
Recognizing the possibilities for economic return
from native plant products,  CI is guiding a major bioprospecting
initiative that has already begun to produce some income for Suriname.
 Partners to the bioprospecting agreement include CI, the U.S.
National Institutes of Health (NIH), pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers
Squibb, Surinamese government agencies, NGOs, and the indigenous
Saramakaner tribe.  Launched in 1994, the project has been collecting
flowering plants from rain forests in southern Suriname and screening
them for biological activity against HIV and cancer.   

<P>
By the
end of 1995, 650 specimens had been collected. Of these, 61 show
promising chemical activity, and 20 have been selected for further
pharmaceutical testing.  Royalties from even one new plant-derived
medication could dwarf logging revenues--and leave the trees standing.

<P>
<STRONG>The Forest Peoples Fund</STRONG> was established by CI to channel funds
from the bioprospecting agreement into conservation initiatives
in indigenous communities in southern Suriname.  This year, the
Forest Peoples Fund helped organize a community center in Asindopo
village to house ecotourists, promote arts and crafts development,
and provide equipment and training to traditional woodcarvers.
 The Fund also financed a delegation of Amerindian and Maroon
village chiefs to visit EMBRAPA, a Brazilian community organization
working on agroforestry and alternative forest products, to exchange
ideas on conservation-based development. 

<P>
<H4>The Shaman's Apprentice
Program</H4>  

<P>
The healers, or shamans, of the tropical forests hold
a world of knowledge about medicinal plants--most of the them
yet unknown to Western science.  To help preserve this knowledge,
foster pride in indigenous traditions, and create an incentive
to protect the forests, CI began the Shaman's Apprentice Program
in 1992 in the Amerindian village of Kwamalasamoetoe.  This program
supports young Tirio men and women in learning about the uses
of rain forest plants from shamans, thus ensuring the knowledge
will be passed on.  Following a visit to the CI project, the neighboring
Wayana people invited CI to start up a similar project in their
village of Tepu, which got underway in 1995.

<H2>Tagua Initiative&#174  Fact Sheet</H2>
</CENTER> 

<P>
In concert with the Foundation for Research and Capacity Building for Socio-Environmental Development (CIDESA), an Ecuadoran nonprofit institution, CI has linked rural harvesters of the ivory-like nut of the tagua palm with button,  jewelry, and carving manufacturers around the world. 
<P>
The Tagua Initiative is designed to help protect the Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve, one of the world's most diverse rain forest "<A HREF="../../fieldact/hotspots/hotspots.htm">hot spots,</A>" while demonstrating the viability of a new model for conservation. In this model, international businesses form partnerships with local producer groups. In doing so, they create the incentives that local people need to save forests, rather than cutting them down. 
<BR>

<UL>
<CENTER>
<H3>Accomplishments of the Tagua Initiative</H3>
</CENTER> 

<LI>Creation of a local enterprise in Comuna Rio Santiago Cayapas, Ecuador, to sell tagua nuts directly to Ecuadorian factories that process them into button blanks and jewelry components for export around the world. 
<BR>

<LI>Training of 20 community members in accounting, management, and product sales to run this local enterprise. Participation of 350 local families - over 1,300 people in the Initiative in Ecuador. 
<BR>

<LI>Sales of more than 2,000 tons of tagua nuts to Ecuadoran factories.  The amount of tagua sold in 1994 increased by 50% over 1993.
<BR>

<LI>Creation of a cottage industry to produce hand-carved buttons.  This community enterprise has sold over 45,000 hand-carved buttons internationally, and forecasts its production for this year to produce and sell 20,000 additional units in the U.S. and Japan.
<BR>

<LI><IMG SRC="../../../RESOURCE/SLIDES/CED/Handnut.jpg" ALT="Handnut.jpg - 8.2 K" WIDTH=207 HEIGHT=136 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=0 ALIGN=right>Sales of over 36 million buttons by 4 TI-licensed international button distributors.  In the past year, button sales totaled more than 10 million units. <BR>

<LI>Expansion of the Tagua Initiative from one product (buttons) in one country (Ecuador) in October 1990 to more than 20 products in 8 countries today.  Over the next year, the TI will be formalizing several new marketing partnerships with wholesalers and retailers in Japan and Europe.
<BR>

<LI>Creation of strategic alliances between the TI and the Keidanren and JAIDO of Japan.  This unique partnership has been crucial in laying the groundwork for solid expansion and advancement of the TI. 
<BR> 

<LI>Design and implementation of scientific and socio-economic studies to monitor the effect and success of the Initiative in terms of biodiversity protection and local benefit.
<BR>

<LI>Development of environmental education programs for local communities.
<BR>
</UL>

Over the past year, the TI has received special recognition for its unique work: 

<UL>
<LI>Partnerships for Change: An international conference hosted by the government of England, as a follow-up to the Rio Earth Summit of 1992, highlighted the TI as a premier example of sustainable development. A key publicity event which gave the TI international recognition, the conference was attended by over 350 participants from over 80 countries. The TI was one of eight case studies chosen to promote successful experiences in sustainable development. 

<LI>United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP):  UNEP  launched a major initiative for worldwide publication of sustainability case studies. The paper was distributed at the UNEP conference in June of 1994, and the resulting publication was sent to over 7,000 individuals and groups worldwide. 
</UL>

<P>
During the last six months, special emphasis has been placed on building facilities to increase local processing capacity, and therefore added value locally.  The community enterprise workers have built five production centers that will allow them to process more nuts, which will lead to increased revenues locally. 
<P>
The Tagua Initiative has had great success in the marketing of its message. At present, TI tagua buttons are used by over 30 well-known garment manufacturers.  Tagua jewelry and carvings are available internationally by <A HREF="../../../CED/PRODUCTS/Markfram.htm">retail and mail order</A>.  Furthermore, the project has benefited greatly from coverage by <I>The New York Times</I>, <I>USA Today</I>, <I>National Geographic</I>, <I>ABC News</I>, <I>CNN</I>, <I>BBC,</I> and <I>Radio France</I>, as well as dozens of other media outlets.

<H2>The Tagua Initiative&#174;</H2>
</CENTER> 

<P>
The Tagua Initiative (TI) is CI's first project to create a sustainable business within a rain forest community.  It markets products such as buttons and jewelry made from the ivory-like tagua palm nut.  People from communities in northwest Ecuador and the Colombian Choc&oacute; harvest tagua from their rich forests without disrupting the forest ecology. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="../../../RESOURCE/SLIDES/CED/Carve.jpg" ALT="Carve.jpg - 6.7 K" WIDTH=131 HEIGHT=200 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 ALIGN=right> In less than four years, the Initiative has sold more than 2,000 tons of raw materials and 36 million finished buttons, creating over 1,300 part-time jobs in the community site, including high-quality artisan jobs manufacturing hand-carved buttons for export.  In addition to the community enterprise, the Initiative works with four major button manufacturers, two manufacturers of tagua carvings, a major jewelry manufacturer, and a button distributor to the retail market.  Dozens of garment manufacturers have joined the Initiative, including such companies as The Gap, Esprit, Timberland, and Smith & Hawken. 
<P>
More important, the Initiative has been an example of alternative land use, and a focal point in local debates over forest stewardship.  It played a role in persuading local people to reject a proposed 12,000 hectare banana plantation, and gained a voice for CI in the development of a regional land-use plan.

<P>
CI is pleased to announce that the Madagascar Biodiversity Information CD-ROM will soon be available. This CD-ROM brings to conclusion the Madagascar Biodiversity Priority-Setting Process and the Workshop held in Antananarivo in April 1995. The workshop was organized by CI in partnership with DEF, FTM and CNRE and was sponsored by UNDP/GEF. This workshop gathered over a hundred of the foremost authorities on the biodiversity of Madagascar, and generated a ground-breaking set of biodiversity conservation and research priorities which formed the basis for a series of regional workshops for policy action.
<P><IMG SRC="../../../resource/maps/madagas.jpg" WIDTH=156 HEIGHT=300 HSPACE=20 VSPACE=20 BORDER=0 ALIGN="LEFT">
The CD-ROM includes the most comprehensive set of maps, text, and digital media ever assembled on Madagascar's biodiversity. This information is organized and presented using PRISMA, a software designed for presenting and publishing complex databases using multimedia technology. For the general public, PRISMA offers an easy-to-use browsing capability to view the data and interpretations of that data. It allows the technical user to export data, to complement the database, and to develop additional and new interpretations of the data. Maps and tables can be exported into the users' GIS and database systems for further analysis and interpretations.
<P>           
The CD-ROM includes the following:
<UL>
	<LI>150 page Final Comprehensive Report of the workshop coordinators
	<LI>All workshop maps, documentation, visual and sound images
	<LI>Executive Summary of the workshop and PPDOP
	<LI>Biodiversity database (including species distribution, survey sites) compiled by 		over 100 scientists preceding the workshop
	<LI>Physical, land-use and demographic database
	<LI>Priority sites database including information about their importance for 		conservation and research
</UL>
<P>
The CD-ROM will be available for $ 45.00 (excl. shipping and handling). This price will cover the cost of duplication and free copies donated to Malagasy institutions.  If you are interested in ordering a copy of the Madagascar Biodiversity Information CDROM please e-mail Danielle Mihalko as soon as possible at <A HREF="mailto:d.mihalko@conservation.org">d.mihalko@conservation.org</A> to ensure your copy.

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">E</FONT>conomics drives much of the world's rain forest destruction.  Local people clear forests to grow crops, raise cattle, cut timber, or pursue industrial development.  Conservation International's Conservation Enterprise Department helps create an alternative to deforestation by developing enterprises based upon sustainable use of natural resources.  These sustainable enterprises market "biodiversity products" such as tree oils, plant fibers, nuts, and latexes harvested in an ecologically sound manner from key biological areas.  In doing so, they demonstrate that sustainable <IMG SRC="../../../resource/facts/fmedical.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" vspace=15 hspace=15 width=250 height=60>enterprise can help local people earn their living by managing and harvesting biologically rich forests instead of destroying them for short-term economic gain.

<P>

When an area of high biodiversity and high endemism (number of species found nowhere else) overlaps an area threatened by habitat destruction, conservationists call that region a "hotspot."  Conservationist Norman Myers was the first to identify these most endangered ecosystems.  Although rain forest hotspots cover 0.64 percent of earth's land area,  scientists think they contain among 30 to 40 percent of the world's biological diversity.  But without dramatic changes, much of these habitats could be destroyed by the year 2000. 

<p>
The top ten hotspots on Myers' list encompass just 0.2 percent of the Earth's land surface and about 3.5 percent of the remaining primary rain forest, but contain more than a quarter and perhaps as much as a third of all plant species found in tropical forests, and thus at least 13 percent of all flowering plants on Earth.  

<P>
Hotspot areas are in red on the map, while tropical wilderness areas are green.

<P>


The key endangered hotspots include:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="../regions/madagasc.htm">Madagascar</A>
<LI>the <A HREF="../regions/atlantic.htm">Atlantic forest</A> region of eastern Brazil
<LI>the lowland forest zone of western <A HREF="../regions/ecuador.htm">Ecuador</A>
<LI>the forested coastal plain of northern Colombia's Choc&oacute; region
<LI>the eastern slopes of the Andes bordering Amazonia in the countries of <A HREF="../regions/columbia.htm">Colombia</A>, Ecuador, <A HREF="../regions/peru.htm">Peru</A>, and <A HREF="../regions/bolivia.htm">Bolivia</A>
<LI>the <A HREF="../regions/philippi.htm">Philippine</A> archipelago
<li>the island of <A HREF="../regions/melanesi.htm">New Caledonia</A>
<li>the remnent forests of Peninsular Malaysia
<li>the remaining forests of northern Borneo in the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak and the country of Brunei
<li>the island of <A HREF="../regions/melanesi.htm">New Guinea</A> (shared by the Papua New Guinea and Irain Jaya province of <A HREF="../regions/indonesi.htm">Indonesia</A>)
<li>the eastern Himalayan foothills
</UL>

<p>Many other areas, though not among this list of ten, have paramount regional significance as well.  They include:

<ul>
<li>the cloud forest and lowland rain forsets of southern <A HREF="../regions/mexico.htm">Mexico</A>, northern <A HREF="../regions/guatemal.htm">Guatemala</A>, and Belize
<li>the forest of the easten Arc mountains in Tanzania
<li>the upper Guinean forest in Liberia and Cote d'Ivoire in West Africa
<li>the Sinharaja forest of Sri Lanka
<li>the tropical forests of Queensland
<li>the Hawaiian Islands
</ul>

<p>Such "second-tier hotspots" will not be neglected; they should be the centerpieces of national conservation programs and CI will be active in many of them as well.

<p>Much has changed since the original list of hotspots was first published.  CI is helping to produce an updated list for early 1997.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>The Shaman's Apprentice Program</H2>

The Shaman's Apprentice Program is a scientific and educational program that preserves indigenous knowledge of tropical plants. Studies have shown that, while new drugs can be found by random screening of plants, plants identified by indigenous people are up to 60 percent more likely to have pharmaceutical potential. For the indigenous people, plants also provide food, oils, latexes, and fibers.
<P>
By creating incentives for young members of Suriname's Tir&iacute;o tribe to learn the traditional uses of plants from their elder medicine men, or shamans, the program helps keep critical indigenous knowledge within the tribe.
<P>
The Shaman's Apprentice Program helps protect the Tir&iacute;o's forests by reestablishing the value of tropical plants and instilling community pride among the tribal youths--youths who will face difficult decisions about the use of their forests in the years to come.
<P>
Currently, one of the apprentices is also playing a key role in developing a cottage industry based on traditional use of non-medical products as a means of generating alternative income.

<H2>Ethnobotany and<BR>The Shaman's Apprentice Program</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>
At the heart of the Suriname Biodiversity Prospecting Initiative is ethnobotany, the study of traditional uses of plants within indigenous communities.  While new drugs can be found through the process of random screening, studies show that plants already identified by indigenous people are up to 60 percent more likely to have pharmaceutical potential than randomly collected plant samples.
<P>
For indigenous people, the forest serves as a source not only of medicines, but a myriad of other everyday products, including foods, oils, latexes, and fibers.  Many of these products can be harvested without destroying a single plant, much less an entire ecosystem. 

<H3>The Problem</H3>

<P>
Unfortunately, the cultures that know and use their forests so well are vanishing today. While many species of rain forest plants face certain extinction, the knowledge of how to use these plants is disappearing even faster.
<P>
With a number of deadly diseases still left to conquer, society cannot afford to lose this indigenous knowledge of the medical uses of plants. Already, one in every twelve prescription drugs sold in U.S. pharmacies is derived from tropical plants, and the value of these drugs is estimated to be about $3 billion per year. Moreover, one-third of all plant-derived prescription drugs come from rain forest species. 
<P>
After decades of focusing almost exclusively on synthetics,  the pharmaceutical industry is again showing interest in developing medicines from tropical plants. Yet these investigations, while unquestionably valuable for the industrialized world, do not always benefit the indigenous peoples themselves.

<H3>A Solution</H3>

Conservation International has established the Shaman's Apprentice Program.  By providing grants to Shaman's Apprentices -- young men and women within forest societies who work with and learn from tribal medicine men and midwives -- the program encourages the transfer of traditional knowledge  to the next generation.  Other program efforts include:

<UL>
<LI>supporting the collection of plant specimens for herbaria and recording scientific descriptions in computerized ethnobotanical archives;
<LI>convening workshops for shamans from different tribal and cultural groups;
<LI>sponsoring the establishment of medicinal plant gardens for both educational and medical purposes within forest and rural communities. 
</UL>
     
<P>
The main goal of the Shaman's Apprentice Program is to preserve and perpetuate indigenous knowledge of medicinal plants and other rain forest products.  Additionally, the program seeks to create mechanisms through which indigenous people can obtain direct benefits from their knowledge about the forest, to promote viable health alternatives where Western medicine is unavailable or inaccessible, and to integrate indigenous and other rural communities into protected area
management.</BLOCKQUOTE>

NEC And Intel Announce Partnership For Global Biodiversity Conservation



</H2></CENTER>

<BR>
<CENTER><TABLE CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=450>

<TD>
<!-------------------------This is the release text---------------------------->
<P>
Jakarta  Computer giants <A HREF="http://www.nec.com" TARGET="main">NEC</A> and <A HREF="http://www.intel.com" TARGET="main">Intel</A> announced a partnership for conservation of the world's  biological diversity today, with joint support of a project to bring computer technology to 25 biosphere reserves in Asia, Latin America and Africa.
<P>
The partnership was announced during the opening ceremony of a two week training workshop for biosphere reserve managers from the Asia region, with representatives from China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Mongolia and Thailand. Conservation International, a U.S. environmental group and a leader in applying computer technologies to conservation will conduct the training. The project is in cooperation with the <A HREF="http://www.unesco.org" TARGET="main">United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization</A> (UNESCO), which created the concept of biosphere reserves in 1971 and today coordinates a network of 334 reserves in 84 countries.
<P>
"This project demonstrates how NEC's commitment to Computers and Communications can increase the human potential to maintain the health of our planet's ecosystems. It extends our long-standing support of environmental initiatives by making the most of technology for nature conservation at a global level," said Mr. Ono, Senior Vice President of NEC Corp.
<P>
"Bringing the power of the personal computer into these biosphere reserves allows researchers to collect and process vast amounts of data and quickly share crucial information with colleagues around the world. Strengthening this capacity will have a multiplying effect throughout the regions in which they work," said Intel Chairman Dr. Gordon E. Moore.
<P>
Indonesia's Ministry of Forestry is hosting the training at the Cibodas reserve near Jakarta. 

<P>

Indonesia is among the world's megadiversity countries, with an extremely high number of 
plant and animals species. It is also experiencing rapid development, which puts pressure on natural ecosystems necessary to support biological diversity.
<P>
The main goals of the project are to strengthen institutional capacity and provide sophisticated computer equipment to allow for the transfer of technology and networking among biosphere reserves. Conservation International, which has projects in several biosphere reserves, will provide training and software for its <A HREF="../../../science/cptc/capbuild/training/cisigbro.htm">Geographic Information System</A> (GIS), Global Positioning Systems (GPS), biological databases and Internet communications.
<P>
"This project illustrates the power of partnerships. NEC and Intel are providing support and technology. Conservation International is providing on the ground expertise and UNESCO is providing global coordination for the network of biosphere reserves," said Peter A. Seligmann, CI Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Together we're bringing the most sophisticated technology to bear on conservation while ensuring economic health."
<P>
Designed to offer local conservationists in developing countries access to critical technology, GIS is particularly useful in biosphere reserves, because it integrates geographical, biological and ecological data with social and economic factors, displaying them as visual images. Among its many applications are assessing the environmental impact of development projects and evaluating trends in deforestation and human disturbances. Access to the Internet is critically important for scientists who can use electronic networks to access data, exchange information, and communicate with their colleagues in other countries.
<P>
"This is conservation at work in today's high-tech world. Getting the right kind of equipment and technology to people in developing nations is a tremendous help in confronting a multitude of rapidly changing environmental challenges . . . " said Silvio T. Olivieri, CI's Vice President for Conservation Planning and Technical Cooperation. "This kind of commitment from corporate leaders is essential in keeping up the necessary momentum to balance the ever increasing pace of environmental destruction throughout the world."
<P>
<A HREF="../../../science/cptc/capbuild/unesco/what_is.htm">Biosphere reserves</A> are dedicated to the conservation of critical ecosystems, scientific research on biological diversity, and the establishment of sustainable alternatives for the 
management of natural resources. However, despite their international recognition, biosphere reserves often face critical shortages in the technology needed to manage natural resources and establish electronic communication links to the outside world.  This 
lack of technical capacity is greatest in developing countries, which frequently claim the highest concentration of biological diversity under the greatest threats.

<H2>More Animals Could Face Extinction

</H2>

 


<P>

Washington, DC:  <A NAME="extinct"></A>Fully a quarter of all known mammal species are at risk of extinction, according to the 1996 <A HREF="http://www.iucn.org/"TARGET="main">IUCN</A> <B>Red List of Threatened Animals</B>  the most comprehensive scientific assessment of threatened species yet produced.  Habitat destruction and other threats are pushing the entire spectrum of Earths biodiversity  alarmingly close to the brink.  
	<P>Published by the <A HREF="http://www.iucn.org/themes/ssc/index.html" TARGET="main">Species Survival Commission</A> (SSC) and CI, the 1996 Red List is the first assessment to mark the conservation status of all known mammals. But the report also contains equally grim estimates on other animals:  11 percent of all known bird species are threatened; 20 percent of reptiles, 25 percent of amphibians, and 34 percent of fish, mostly freshwater species.  
	<P>This scientific assessment is indisputable proof that warnings about global biological diversity loss havent been exaggerated  if anything weve been too optimistic, said Russell A. Mittermeier, CI president and chair of the SSCs <B>Primate Specialist Group</B>.   Furthermore, the 1996 List is the first study to use rigorous criteria for assessing the conservation status of species, making these grim findings more defensible than ever before.
	<P>To produce the 1996 list, 500 scientists, including those from SSC partners <A HREF="http://www.surfnet.fi/birdlife/int/index.html" TARGET="main">BirdLife International</A>, CI, <A HREF="http://www.tnc.org" TARGET="main">The Nature Conservancy</A>, and the <A HREF="http://www.wcmc.org.uk/" TARGET="main">World Conservation Monitoring Centre</A>, provided data and carried out assessments.   For the first time, the List has added a critical category representing the most endangered of the endangered speciesthose animals on the edge of extinction. The Red List is actually a red flag, warning us about the perilous state of animals and drawing attention to threats such as habitat destruction,  pollution, over-harvesting, and  the introduction of non-native species, said Jorgen Thomsen, CI's Senior Director for Conservation Biology.
	<P>The Red List originated in 1960 as a set of index cards containing information on 34 mammals on file at the SSC Secretariat in London.  In more than three decades, the job of  monitoring the status of the worlds biodiversity has drawn together the SSC volunteer network including more than 7,000 scientists, field researchers, government officials and conservation leaders from 179 countries.


<H3><A NAME="sky"></A>Logging Thousands of Perilous Hours in the Sky for Conservation
</H3>
<P>

Tucson, Arizona:  Pilot Sandy Lanham may have one of the most dangerous jobs in conservation.  Lanham flies more than 30 partners in Mexico, helping them gather data for wetlands and migratory bird research, mountain range and desert surveys, and inventories of marine mammals and other endangered wildlife. These flights can be fatiguing, and sometimes dangerous, said Lanham.  Because we often fly for hours at less than 200 feet above ground or sea level, a momentary lapse of concentration could send us into the cacti of the Sonoran desert.
	<P>Aviationan essential conservation tool in remote areasis usually too costly for researchers in developing countries.  But in Mexico, Lanham is making overflights affordable through her Tucson-based company, <B>Environmental Flying Services</B> (EFS).  Supported by CI and other institutions, Lanham has logged 3000 hours of flying time since 1991 for Mexican wildlife managers and researchers.
  <P>	Lanham, a Michigan native, has been flying for 16 years.  She came up with the idea to start EFS when she was living in Sonora, Mexico in the 1980s.  I knew the need was great because researchers kept asking for my time, Lanham said.
	<P>In the <B>Gulf of California</B>, Lanham is assisting Silvia Manvanilla from the Independent University of Mexico to track the position and movements of the vaquita  a rare and elusive porpoise.  Their findings will help determine key threats and the areas most critical for the vaquitas survival.  Last July, Lanham and Manvanilla made the first-ever vaquita sightings in the Colorado River where it joins the Gulf of California.  Conservationists hope to leverage this finding with policymakers to expand protection for the vaquita.
	<P>Lanham is also helping CIs Gulf of California program conduct a survey of small fishing boats and fishing camps along 2,000 kilometers of coastline in the gulfconsidered one of the richest fisheries in the western hemisphere.  So far, CI has tallied over 10,000 vessels in a series of overflights.  CI will use the census results to pinpoint where the gulfs resources are most exploited and to determine where to target sustainable use programs.



<H3><A NAME="rap"></A>AquaRAP Races to Explore, Conserve Depths of Aquatic Biodiversity
</H3>
 <P>
Cobija, Bolivia:  Our current understanding of aquatic life barely skims the surface of the vast biodiversity believed to exist underwater. While many terrestrial ecosystems have been studied extensively by biologists, most tropical aquatic ecosystems are still essentially unknown to science.  Despite this lack of information, major decisions threatening rivers and watershedssuch as the construction of hydroelectric damsare being made throughout the tropics.
<P>To address the critical gap in tropical freshwater biology,  CI and Chicagos <A HREF="http://www.bvis.uic.edu/museum/" TARGET="main">Field Museum of Natural History</A>, with support from <A HREF="http://www.wajones.org" TARGET="main">W. Alton Jones Foundation</A>, have launched the <B>Aquatic Rapid Assessment Program</B> (AquaRAP).  Like the legendary terrestrial RAP team, the AquaRAP team was set up to conduct fast, but thorough, surveys of freshwater ecosystems throughout the tropics and to recommend to policymakers key areas for protection and management alternatives.
<P>Rivers depend on one another as well as on the surrounding forest for ecological health, said Barry Chernoff, a world-renowned ichthyologist with the Field Museum and AquaRAP team leader.  If one river crashes, or if we cut down the forest, many other rivers can die, too.  The loss of a river will also hurt the forest because many species of plants depend on fishes for seed dispersal and germination. 
<P>In September, the AquaRAP team made its pilot expedition to Bolivia to look at the basins of the <B>Tahuamanu and Manuripi Rivers</B>.   For four weeks, the teams 22 scientists from Bolivia, Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, Paraguay, and the United States worked in the rivers and nearby stream, marsh, and swamp habitats with nets and other collection tools to document the areas fish, aquatic invertebrates, and vegetation and to assess its conservation value.  
<P>In just four weeks, our team found approximately 250 fish species, which is incredible when we realize that only 400 species have been documented from the entire country, said Chernoff.  Clearly, there is wealth of diversity underneath the water surface that we know very little about.  The scientists also found at least <B>three species never documented</B> before in Bolivia and <B>five species new to science</B>, including a dinosaur-like armored catfish covered in bony plates.
<P>These findings confirm that the Tahuamanu and Manuripi Rivers  are a significant priority for biodiversity conservation, said Chernoff.  We will provide policymakers with information on these discoveries, and suggestions for how to protect and manage  the river basins. We hope they will take our advice  into consideration as they evaluate potentially damaging road-building plans for this area.
 <P>Recommendations from this and future AquaRAP surveys will impact  rural communities and indigenous groups across the tropics who depend on fish as their sole source of protein, said Jorgen Thomsen, CIs Senior Director for Conservation Biology.  Right now, fish populations in many areas are falling rapidly because of pollution and overfishing, and local people are without food.
<P>As part of the pilot mission to Bolivia, AquaRAP scientists developed a standard methodology to assess the biological and conservation value of complex river systems on a continental scale. Because important watersheds often span more than one country, conservation recommendations from AquaRAP expeditions could help catalyze international cooperation on conservation issues.


<H2><A NAME="nasa"></A>CI and NASA Scientists Stumble on Ancient Mayan City</H2>


<P>
The recent discovery of the ruins of Lo Veremos in Guatemalas <B>Laguna del Tigre National Park</B> underscores how unexplored the depths of the rain forest remain. Jim Nations, CIs Vice President of MesoAmerican Programs, and his colleague Tom Sever from <A HREF="http://www.nasa.gov" TARGET="main">NASA</A>, were analyzing data from satellite images of northern Guatemala.  Their goal was to measure the impact of human activities on the regions habitat over the past ten years.  Instead, they were struck by changes that had occurred at least 1,200 years earlier.
	<P> Down in the forest, you cant see the road for the trees, said Nations.  But if youre looking at satellite photos    the ruins of ancient Maya cities and the roads that connected them can be traced like a secret code under the forest cover.   Thats why Nations and Sever are calling this major archaeological site, Lo Veremos, (we will see it).
	<P>Mayan burial mounds and small ruins are sprinkled through the lowland tropical forests of northern Guatemala and southern Mexico.  The legacy of  Maya culture is evident throughout the region, Nations said.  But  Lo Veremos could be an especially significant link in Maya archaeological studies.  Intriguing findings here of ancient Maya glyphs, the remains of walls and water reservoirseven boat docksall could shed light on some of the mysteries of Maya culture. 
	<P>CI staff have registered the site with <B>Guatemalas Ministry of Archeology</B>,  although it may be years before archaeologists excavate the ruins.
	<P>For the people of nearby Carmelita, Lo Veremos is a potential attraction for ecotourists who are drawn to the region to see the world-famous ruins of Tikal and the scenic beauty of the Maya Biosphere Reserve.  Communities in and around the reserve are especially eager to develop sites because ecotourism has brought money into their communities.  Through projects like <A HREF="../../fieldact/regions/guatemal.htm">CIs Scarlet Macaw Trail</A>, people here have seen that preserving their cultural heritage and local habitats can alter the economy without altering the landscape, said Nations.  We need more incentives like Lo Veremos to encourage local conservation.   



<H3><A NAME="cheetah"></A>World Cheetah Population at All Time Low</H3>
<P>


Washington, DC:  The cheetahthe fastest animal on four legsis also one of Earths most endangered mammals.  According to <B>Namibias Cheetah Conservation Fund</B> (CCF), Africas cheetah population is currently less than 15,000, down from about 100,000 in 1900.  Less than 200 cheetahs remain in Iran, representing the last of the Asian cheetahs.
	<P>About 10,000 years ago, the species went through a population bottleneckan extreme population reduction and subsequent rebound through inbreeding.   This event dramatically reduced the amount of genetic variation in the species, making the cheetah highly susceptible to ecological and environmental changes today. 
	<P>Recent actions of humans have worsened the cheetahs vulnerable condition.  The most significant human threat to the cheetahs survival is habitat destruction, which has reduced the amount of available prey and caused fatal conflicts with domestic livestock and livestock farmers.  In Namibia alone, humans have killed or removed nearly 7,000 cheetahs between 1980 and 1991 because of perceived attacks on livestock. 
	<P>Research to better understand ecological threats is integral to maintaining endangered species like the cheetah.   As part of our research efforts, CI has supported studies by the CCF to determine the distribution of and risks to cheetahs in Botswana.   
	

<H3>Guatemalan Community Reaches<BR>
Milestone with EcoEscuela</H3>
<P>


San Andres, Guatemala:  More than 50 teachers and house mothers working with the <A HREF="../../fieldact/ecoescue/ecoescue.htm">EcoEscuela</A> stood proudly in front of hundreds of community members and invited guests for a press event this fall to mark a major milestone in the social and economic development of the townindependence of the EcoEscuela.
	<P>The EcoEscuela is a school in <B>San Andres</B> offering Spanish language and environmental education to foreigners.  In 1993 CI and the community launched this school as an economic alternative to destructive land uses in the neighboring Maya Biosphere Reserve.  Since then, EcoEscuela has boosted commitment to conservation in San Andres by providing the projects anfitrioneshouse mothers that host studentsand teachers with reliable family income dependent  on standing forest.  Now the stafffollowing three years of hard workhave formed a corporation to take over EcoEscuela as an independent, locally managed organization.
	<P>We are proud of EcoEscuela and what it has done for our community, said one house mother.  It is helping us preserve a healthy environment and economy for our children.  This is why we have taken EcoEscuela into our own hands.
	<P>The house mothers and teachers, while not legal owners of EcoEscuela until now, have demonstrated a strong spirit of ownership in the school since its inception.  Meanwhile CI provided training in a range of skills from language instruction to business management to writing marketing plans.
	<P>The local environmental commitment fostered by EcoEscuela has had a critical ripple effect on regional political attitudes.  For example, when cattle owned by a local rancher encroached upon the schools ecological preserve, house mothersconcerned about potential impacts on the community and the environmentorganized a group to alert the municipal government of the situation.  The result was an official order to the rancher to remove his cattle from the area. 
	<P>The work ethic of the community members was instrumental in the schools transformation into an economically viable, self-sufficient institution.  Between 1993 and 1996 annual student attendance grew from about 100 to over 500, and the staff launched several community conservation programsincluding a reforestation project and an interpretive nature trail. 
	<P>By providing employment for 60 families and stimulating business for local restaurants, stores, and ecotourism, the schools success has helped convince the municipal government of San Andres that conservation makes economic sense.

<CENTER><H2>Pet&eacuten, Guatemala</H2></CENTER>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the dense jungle cover of Guatemala's vast northeastern department of El Pet&eacuten, you may hear the squawk of parrots, the chatter of monkeys and the rustlings of strange animals moving through the bush.  The landscape here is utterly different from that of Guatemala's cool mountainous highlands or its steamy Pacific Slope.
<P>
<IMG SRC="../../../RESOURCE/SLIDES/ECOESC/Tikal.jpg" ALT="Tikal.jpg - 8.1 K" WIDTH=141 HEIGHT=206 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=0 ALIGN=right>The monumental Mayan ceremonial centre at Tikal is a major stop on La Ruta Maya.  The ruins of Uaxact&uacuten and Ceibal, though not so easily accessible, are perhaps more exciting to visit for that reason.  Several dozen other great cities lie hidden in El Pet&eacuten's jungles, accessible only to archaeologists with aircraft or to artifact poachers with stonecutting tools.
<P>
The battle for El Pet&eacuten is raging even as you read this.  Will it be left alone and preserved as one vast natural and archaeological zone?  Will its forests be cut and cut by farmers and cattle ranchers until the lush green carpet of trees and vines all but disappears, as has happened just across the border in Mexico?  Or will the idea of La Ruta Maya--careful environmental and archaeological preservation through managed development with economic benefits for all--triumph. . .  In 1990 the Guatemalan government established the one million-hectare Maya Biosphere Reserve, including most of northern El Pet&eacuten.  The Guatemalan reserve adjoins vast Calakmul Biosphere Reserve in Mexico and the Rio Bravo Conservation Area in Belize, forming a huge multinational reserve of over two million hectares.
<P>
There are three reasons to penetrate the forests of El Pet&eacuten:  firstly to visit Tikal, the greatest Mayan religious center yet discovered; secondly to enjoy the great variety of birdlife, including the rare, shy quetzal; and thirdly, to see a different Guatemala, one of small farming villages and jungle hamlets, without paved roads or colonial architecture.

<h2 align=center>From an Eco-Escuela Alum...</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>At the end of my trip to Guatemala my plan was to study Spanish for
two weeks at the Eco-Escuela de Espaol, which someone told me about when
I was in Belize. I had finished a week of language school in Antigua, where
my Spanish practice ended after the four hours of instruction; thus, I
was eager for an experience less riddled with foreigners. I found it in
the tranquil, lakeside town of San Andrs, and I ended up studying for
three weeks, and extending my stay in San Andrs for a total of two and
a half months. This was a common trend among students. </p>

<p>Although I could barely communicate in Spanish when I arrived, I could
feel that this was a special place where people treated me as a guest rather
than as a walking dollar sign. By the time I left, I owed thanks to many
new friends for both the improvement in my Spanish and in my understanding
of an amazing culture. Even after four hours of intensive one-on-one classes,
I was motivated to study and practice so that I could communicate with
the people who were eager to share their legends, customs, and knowledge
of the forest. </p>

<p>When the secretary of the school walked me to the house of my family,
I opened the window to be greeted with a spectacular view of Lake Petn
Itz, a feature in which most houses in San Andrs share. Shortly after,
several pairs of curious eyes peered in, and minutes later I had four additional
Spanish teachers all under the age of twelve. I felt more a part of this
community than anywhere else I have ever lived. </p>

<p>People often feel overwhelmed by the problems of the world. As a result,
they are led to inaction by their feelings of inadequacy to make a significant
improvement. However, during my stay in San Andrs, I could see the direct
impact of my presence and the presence of other students. Financially,
many people benefited including the teachers, the <i>tienda</i> (store)
owners, the host families, and the tour guides for the excursions. </p>

<p>Every day held unlimited opportunities to learn something new whether
it was a new Spanish word, a new medicinal use of a plant, or a cultural
difference. You can read about different cultures, but only by total immersion
can you really understand. </p>

<p>As much as I was learning about their culture, San Andreseos were learning
about mine, which is important especially since their perception of the
States is often based on <i>Baywatch</i> reruns. The exchange and sharing
of experiences is invaluable. The mother of my family always asked me about
my house, my hometown, and how they compare to hers in San Andrs. She
remembered the names of the parents and siblings of every student she had
hosted. That many people of all ages from all over the world fall in love
with San Andrs relays an important message to the local people. It strengthens
the pride in their town. </p>

<p>I also learned about the interrelationship of cultural and environmental
issues. Many families are dependent on the livelihood of the surrounding
forest, and the livelihood of the forest depends on its conservation and
management. </p>

<p>They say that if you drink the water of Lake Petn Itz&amp;a, you will
return someday. I can attest to its truth. Even before I left, I was already
making plans for my return. It is nice to know thaacute;t whenever I return
I will always have a place to stay and many friends to visit in San Andrs.
</p>

<CENTER><h2>Questions and Answers About the Eco-Escuela</h2></CENTER>

<BR>
<BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><b><i>How old is the Eco-Escuela?</i></b> </p>

<p>The Eco-Escuela was officially opened in March of 1993 and has received
over 500 students. </p>

<p><b><i>Who typically attends the Eco-Escuela program?</i></b> </p>

<p>There is no &quot;typical&quot; Eco-Escuela student. The school has
received students ranging in age from 18-73, the majority of whom fall
between the ages of 22 and 35. Individuals come from many different backgrounds
and parts of the world. </p>

<p><b><i>Does the program focus more on language instruction or environmental
issues?</i></b> </p>

<p>The Eco-Escuela is first and foremost a Spanish language school. Education
about the environmental issues and ecology of the Petn is integrated into
the structure of the daily classes (i.e. interpretive forest walks, class
field trips, teacher-student conversation), and activities outside of class
(such as evening lectures, volunteering, and weekend excursions). Students
are invited, but not required, to become involved in the ecological aspects
of the program. </p>

<p><b><i>How long should I stay?</i></b> </p>

<p>Because classes are held in weekly increments, the program is flexible
according to each student's needs and travel schedule. Your length of stay
will depend on: the amount of time you have available, your learning capacity
(whether you are a quick learner or need that extra time), and what you
want to get out of the program. In the past, students have stayed from
one week to four months. </p>

<p><b><i>Can I stay in the same house with my spouse or travel companion?</i></b></p>

<p>There are several homestay families that can provide housing for couples
and/or friends. Although these accommodations cannot be guaranteed at the
time of making reservations, the Eco-Escuela will make every effort to
accommodate such requests. Please keep in mind that students tend to learn
Spanish faster when they are not in constant contact with friends they
may be tempted to speak to in their native language. It may be to your
advantage to avoid these situations by living in separate households, (keeping
in mind that all homestays are within walking distance). </p>

<p><b><i>Is it safe in San Andrs, Guatemala?</i></b> </p>

<p>The Eco-Escuela is unaware of any occurances of threats to the personal
safety of past students while living in San Andrs. Tourism is a foundation
of the Petenero economy, and the local people recognize the importance
of accepting foreigners. However, individuals should always take necessary
safety precautions when travelling in a foreign country. For recorded travel
information about the country of Guatemala call the U.S. Department of
State at (202)647-5225. </p>

<p><b><i>What options do I have if I choose not to stay with a host family?</i></b>
</p>

<p>The Eco-Escuela strongly recommends that students take advantage of
the opportunity to share in the lives, customs, and language of a San Andrs
family. Most students identify their homestay as the most rewarding part
of their Eco-Escuela experience. Also, by staying with a family, you are
supporting the school's mission of creating alternative forms of income
for local people. It is rare that a student opts not to stay with a family,
but if you should, there is one small inn in San Andrs and many others
in nearby Flores and Santa Elena. We advise that students stay in San Andrs
in order to avoid inconvenient differences in transportation and class
schedules. </p>

<p><b><i>Can I receive college credit?</i></b> </p>

<p>Although the Eco-Escuela does not offer college credit, many students
are able to make special arrangements through their schools to receive
credit for their studies and experience at the Eco-Escuela. </p>

<p><b><i>How far in advance do I need to register?</i></b> </p>

<p>The Eco-Escuela prefers students to register at least 3 weeks in advance,
although we do accept last minute reservations according to space availability.
The school has a limit of 24 students at one time. To guarantee your space,
early registration is recommended. </p>

<p><b><i>What qualifications do Eco-Escuela teachers hold?</i></b> </p>

<p>Eco-Escuela teachers have been certified under the Guatemala education
system as teachers and have been specially trained in teaching Spanish
to non-native speakers. </p>

<p><b><i>What books are used at the school? Should I bring my own?</i></b>
</p>

<p>The Eco-Escuela has no specific book that it uses in class. Different
materials are used for different students. If you have a certain book or
workbook that you use or would like to use in class, please feel free to
bring it. </p>

<p><b><i>What is acceptable dress in San Andrs?</i></b> </p>

<p>Classes are casual. Most clothes are acceptable in San Andrs, although
we would recommend that students avoid wearing short shorts or skirts,
or halter tops. Use your own discretion while maintaining cultural sensitivity.
</p>

<p><b><i>How much money should I bring?</i></b> </p>

<p>If you choose to live with a host family, all of your lodging and food
are paid for while you are enrolled in the Eco-Escuela. These expenses
would normally be the majority of your spending while traveling. Added
expenses may include: optional weekend excursions (ranging from $10-30),
personal travel to sights such as Tikal, soda/beer/bottled water and snacks,
souvenirs and crafts. In general, travel, food, and lodging are very cheap
in Guatemala. Travelers cheques are accepted in most banks and hotels.
Access/Mastercard, American Express, Visa/Barclycard are accepted in some
hotels and few restaurants. Cash advances are available from a limited
number of banks. If you will be staying for several months, you may wish
to consider opening a bank account. </p>

<p><b><i>Should I bring my homestay family a gift?</i></b> </p>

<p>It is always nice to give your family a little something as a sign of
your appreciation, but by no means are you obligated to do so. Gifts in
the past have included children's toys, frisbees, crayons, markers, flashlights,
picture books of your home state/country, something native of your state/country,
t-shirts, and mugs. Be creative, yet conservative. Bring pictures of your
family to share with your host family. </p>

<p><b><i>What kind of volunteer opportunities can students become involved
in?</i></b> </p>

<p>Interested students are encouraged to participate in volunteer activities
twice a week in the afternoons. Activities change according to what projects
in the area are looking for assistance and what projects the school itself
is working on. In the past students have worked to: </p>

<ul>
<li>create a garbage pick-up within the community that has markedly decreased
the level of litter and increased community awareness about pollution;
</li>

<li>create an &quot;Interpretive Trail&quot; used by students of the Eco-Escuela
and all San Andrs public schools as an educational tool where students
can learn about the forest's plants and their traditional uses; </li>

<li>build bungalows at the public beach where students and community members
can relax or study in the shade after taking a dip in Lake Petn Itz;
</li>

<li>ensure the growth of saplings in a reforestation project by clearing
areas of menacing overgrowth; and </li>

<li>create a better learning environment for the children of San Andrs
by helping to build, repair, and clean classrooms, chairs, desks, etc.
in local schools. </li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>Do I need a visa to enter Guatemala?</i></b> </p>

<p>To travel to Guatemala U.S. citizens must have a passport and either
a tourist card or a visa. Tourist cards or visas are valid for at least
thirty days and can allow you to stay in the country for up to ninety days.
Both can be extended at the immigration department in Guatemala City or
renewed by leaving and reentering the country. U.S. citizens must carry
identification with them at all times. Tourist cards cost US$5.00 and can
be purchased upon arrival at the airport in Guatemala, at the Guatemalan
border, or at the airport departure gate for flights from the U.S. to Guatemala.
If you are a British, US, or Canadian citizen, you need only a tourist
card and passport to enter the country if entering by air. </p>

<p>Visas are available from the Embassy of Guatemala at 2220 R Street,
N.W., Washington, D.C. 20008, tel: (202) 745-4952, or Guatemalan Consulates
in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, New Orleans, New York, Houston or
Chicago. Non-U.S. citizens should contact a Guatemalan Consulate in their
country for information on entry requirements. </p></BLOCKQUOTE>

<TR><TD valign=top width=50%><H2>New Primate Species<BR>
Discovered in Brazil
</H2>

 
Washington, D.C.: The Amazonian rain forest has revealed 
a new biological treasure: The newest marmoset species, Callithrix saterei, a squirrel-sized primate, was discovered in the Brazilian Amazon in 1993. Named for an indigenous group living near the site of the discovery, the Satere marmoset is distinguished from its close relatives by such features as unpigmented skin on its face and ears, and burnt-orange color fur on its body. 
	<P>"Finding a new beetle in the rain forest may not be surprising, but a new primate species is extraordinary," said Russell A. Mittermeier, CI President and Chairman of the Primate Specialist Group of the World Conservation Union Species Survival Commission (IUCN/SSC). "This discovery attests to the vast diversity of life on earth that remains unknown to us and shows how ignorant we still are of our fellow species -- even a well-studied group such as primates."
	<P>The Satere marmoset is the sixth new monkey species found in Brazil since 1990, raising the count of Brazils primate species to 75 -- more than double the number found in Indonesia, Madagascar, or Zaire. These four nations account for 66 percent of the 275 nonhuman primate species found in 92 countries worldwide. Brazil alone accounts for 27 percent of the total.
	<P>"As scientists continue to explore undisturbed tracts of Amazonian forest, I wouldnt be surprised if we found another five monkeys by the year 2000," said Dr. Mittermeier.
	<P>The scientifc description of the marmoset, supported by CI, appeared in the Brazilian journal Goeldiana.

<H3>CD Players in the Rain Forest</H3>
<P>
Washington, DC: The late Ted Parker attained legendary stature among birders for his ability to identify the calls of more than 4,000 species of birds. As part of the ornithological surveys he conducted in his years of Neotropical research, Parker would pre-record tapes -- and then play back the calls to attract individual birds in his vicinity. Using this technique, he was able to census the majority of bird species inhabiting a targeted geographic range.
	

<P>To make these resources available to field biologists, CI and the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithologys Library of Natural Sounds are collaborating on a compact-disc set of 300 recorded bird calls from the lowland region of southeastern Peru. Over half the recordings were made by Parker, whose collection of nearly 10,000 bird calls 
is housed at Cornell.
	
<P>"This tool is still in the testing stage, but we hope it will dramatically speed up the process of cataloging the worlds uncharted bird diversity," said Tom Schulenberg, leader of CIs Rapid Assessment Program and ornithologist with the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago.  "The CD will place the hard-won knowledge of brilliant ornithologists like Parker at the fingertips of the new generation of field scientists."




<A NAME="water"></A><H3>Water Pipeline Poses New Threat <BR>to Okavango Delta</H3>
Maun, Botswana: Namibia is in the grip of a severe drought, threatening the countrys water supply. To avert a water crisis in the capital city of Windhoek, the Namibian govern-ment is proposing to run a pipeline from the Okavango River, as soon as funding can be secured from international donors. Conservationists say that large-scale extractions via this pipeline will upset the delicate water cycle of Botswanas Okavango Delta, which is already at its 
lowest level in decades.
	

<P>"Water development schemes -- in Namibia, Angola, and Botswana -- pose one of the greatest threats to the future of the Okavango Delta," said Lee Hannah, CIs Director for Africa. Over the past ten months, conservationists have confronted several new threats to the delta, including a series of veterinary fences erected to prevent the spread of a contagious disease among cattle, and Namibias proposal for water withdrawal, which is being planned at a greatly accelerated rate. 
	
<P>"Any shift in the regions water-use patterns will have an impact on the deltas fragile ecology," said Karen Ross, Director of CIs Okavango Delta Program. "Its critical for the nations of the region to agree to significant limits on water withdrawal from the Okavango River to ensure the natural functioning of the delta ecosystem."
	
<P>The Okavango Delta, one of Africas greatest wetlands regions, is replenished each year by the food tide of the Okavango River. This food peak sustains the flora and fauna of the Okavango wetlands, and ultimately provides a livelihood to indigenous peoples.
	

<P>But the foods have been small for the past five years. This year, they have yet to reach the town of Maun, whose river has been dry for ten months.
 	

<P>"CIs chief concern is to ensure the integrity of the Okavango Delta at the same time that its benefts are equitably shared," said Hannah.  Hannah suggested that Namibia could explore options such as intensifed water recycling, water desalinization, and use of underground water. 
	 

<P>Botswana, Namibia, and Angola took a major step toward coordinated planning of the Okavango with the signing of the Okavango River Basin Water Commission Agreement 
in September 1994. The trinational commission (OKACOM) created by this agreement will recommend developments and investigate the impacts of surface and subsurface water development of the greater Okavango watershed.


<P>"The problem with Namibias new proposal is that it preempts the work of OKACOM," said Ross. "Not until OKACOM conducts a thorough river basin management study can the three countries agree on how to regulate water use."

<TD valign=top><H2>Pulsar Pledges $10 Million To<BR>Selva Lacandona Conservation</H2>

Monterrey, Mexico: Pulsar Internacional, S.A. de C.V., one of Mexicos largest companies, has committed $10 million to CI for conservation activities in the Selva Lacandona region over the next five years. The pledge made by Alfonso Romo, Pulsars chairman and CI board member, is the largest private gift ever for conservation efforts in Latin America.
	

<P>The Selva Lacandona --one of the last remaining 
North American rain forests and Mexicos highest conservation priority -- is under siege. The region has become the scene of intense disputes over access to land, where vying indigenous communities have already come to blows over dwindling resources.
	

<P>With increased competition for land, farmers are rapidly clear-cutting forests for crops and cattle-ranching. According to a study by the Mexican university ECOSUR, there will be no forest left in the state of Chiapas in 
48 years if deforestation continues at its current rate. The combined effects of economic pressures, ecological destruction, and population growth could threaten the stability of the entire region.
	

<P>Through Romos grant, CI, Pulsar, and local communities have formed a partnership to defuse the situation. A team of Pulsar engineers and scientists and CI staff will spear-head a new initiative to address the ecological and economic problems confronting the region and develop forest-friendly alternative activities in the Selva Lacandona.
	

<P>Pulsars research and development 
institution, the Center for Agricultural Studies, will establish experimental stations to identify improved agricultural techniques for local farmers. In the buffer zone surrounding the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve, farmers will learn 
to cultivate new, marketable crops. 
And the grant will reinforce CIs current projects through environmental education, construction of biological stations, policy initiatives, and microenterprise development. 
	
<P>"At Pulsar, we feel that the conservation of Mexicos natural resources is of the utmost importance, and we continually seek opportunities to improve our environment as well as our countrys prosperity," said Romo.
	

<P>Pulsar provides literacy and training programs for workers at its Chiapas operations, reflecting the companys commitment to cultivating the regions social, economic, and environmental resources. Pulsars program will help to stabilize the region and relieve 
the pressures on the already strained ecosystems of the Selva Lacandona. 


<A NAME="tech"></A><H3>Biosphere Reserves Forge Links Through Internet <BR>
and Powerful New Technologies</H3>
<P>	
Chiapas, Mexico: The first Biosphere Reserve Training Workshop in Central America was sponsored by CI, Intel Corporation and the United Nations Educational, Scientifc and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in July 1996. The three-week workshop equipped institutions in six biosphere reserves with Internet access, computers, and CIs conser-vation planning software, and provided intensive training to 13 experts in the use of these systems. The participating reserves included La Amistad in Panama, La Amistad 
in Costa Rica, Maya in Guatemala, Sierra del Rosario in Cuba, and Alto Golfo and Montes Azules in Mexico.
	

<P>The program will allow park managers and researchers to exchange information 
on the Internet and integrate conservation activities with partners on the local, regional, and global levels. "With these technologies, researchers can collect and process vast amounts of data and quickly share crucial information with colleagues around the world," said Intel Chairman Gordon Moore. CI will also continue to provide technical support 
to the biosphere reserve network.
	
<P>
The CI-Intel-UNESCO partnership will sponsor a series of biosphere reserve work-shops in Latin America, Asia, and Africa over the next year, including one in South America in September. The worlds 334 biosphere reserves, coordinated by UNESCO since 1976, are protected areas surrounded by buffer zones where scientific research and sustainable development activities are promoted.

<H3>Peru Declares National Park<BR>
in Tambopata Heath Region</H3>

<P>Lima, Peru: The government of Peru established the Bahuaja-Sonene National Park on the eastern slopes of the Andes in July 1996, granting permanent protection to some of the most biologically important territory on the planet. The 802,750 acre park includes the Pampas del Heath National Sanctuary and a part of Tambopata Candamo Reserved Zone, a tract of Amazonian rain forest harboring extremely high species diversity.
	

The declaration follows over a half-decade of intense work in the region. In 1990, CIs Rapid Assessment Program documented the rich habitats of Tambopata and identified the area as a top global conservation priority. Since then, CI-Peru has helped bring together local communities, indigenous people, and nongovernmental organizations on an array of socioeconomic studies and sustainable enterprise projects -- including a successful Brazil nut industry -- to gain their commitment to a protected area.

<P>	
"We see the park as the focus for a social contract between the local people who support this park, conservationists, and the government," said Avecita Chicchn, director of CIs Peru Program. When CI first began work-ing in this region, local conservationists gained community support for the park proposal in exchange for economic alternatives to destructive land-use practices. 
	

<P>There is still much work to be done. "Creating Bahuaja-Sonene National Park is an important first step 
in setting aside the entire Tambopata Candamo area," said Rod Mast, CI Vice President for the Andes Region. "We are committed to continuing efforts to ensure that 
the entire 5,600 square-mile area eventually achieves national park status."

<A NAME="chall"></A><H3>CI Meets Challenge Grant Goal</H3>

<P>
Washington, DC: CI raised 
$1 million in just three months to complete a challenge grant launched by actor Harrison Ford and Intel Chairman Gordon Moore, both CI board members. 
In March, Ford and Moore pledged to match dollar-for-dollar all unrestricted contributions made to CI by June 30. A total of 1,767 individuals and 30 organizations contributed $1,085,000.

<P>"This exceptional display of commitment to the CI family 
will be instrumental in forging conservation partnerships across the globe," said CI Vice President of Development and Communications Karen Ziffer. "We would like to offer our sincerest thanks to Harrison, Gordon, and everyone who joined in this challenge."

<H3>Conservation Leader Joins CI Papua <BR>
New Guinea Staff</H3>

<P>
Port Moresby, PNG: Gai Kula, one of the foremost conservationists in Papua New Guinea, has become CIs new program director based in that country. Since 1992, Kula has been First Assistant Secretary for Nature Conservation in PNGs Department of Environment and Conservation, where he was responsible for all govern-ment biodiversity programs. "Gai is a visionary," said CI President Russell A. Mittermeier.

<TR><TD valign=top width=50%><H2>New Primate Species<BR>
Discovered in Brazil
</H2>

 
Washington, D.C.: The Amazonian rain forest has revealed 
a new biological treasure: The newest marmoset species, Callithrix saterei, a squirrel-sized primate, was discovered in the Brazilian Amazon in 1993. Named for an indigenous group living near the site of the discovery, the Satere marmoset is distinguished from its close relatives by such features as unpigmented skin on its face and ears, and burnt-orange color fur on its body. 
	<P>"Finding a new beetle in the rain forest may not be surprising, but a new primate species is extraordinary," said Russell A. Mittermeier, CI President and Chairman of the Primate Specialist Group of the World Conservation Union Species Survival Commission (IUCN/SSC). "This discovery attests to the vast diversity of life on earth that remains unknown to us and shows how ignorant we still are of our fellow species -- even a well-studied group such as primates."
	<P>The Satere marmoset is the sixth new monkey species found in Brazil since 1990, raising the count of Brazils primate species to 75 -- more than double the number found in Indonesia, Madagascar, or Zaire. These four nations account for 66 percent of the 275 nonhuman primate species found in 92 countries worldwide. Brazil alone accounts for 27 percent of the total.
	<P>"As scientists continue to explore undisturbed tracts of Amazonian forest, I wouldnt be surprised if we found another five monkeys by the year 2000," said Dr. Mittermeier.
	<P>The scientifc description of the marmoset, supported by CI, appeared in the Brazilian journal Goeldiana.

<H3>CD Players in the Rain Forest</H3>
<P>
Washington, DC: The late Ted Parker attained legendary stature among birders for his ability to identify the calls of more than 4,000 species of birds. As part of the ornithological surveys he conducted in his years of Neotropical research, Parker would pre-record tapes -- and then play back the calls to attract individual birds in his vicinity. Using this technique, he was able to census the majority of bird species inhabiting a targeted geographic range.
	

<P>To make these resources available to field biologists, CI and the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithologys Library of Natural Sounds are collaborating on a compact-disc set of 300 recorded bird calls from the lowland region of southeastern Peru. Over half the recordings were made by Parker, whose collection of nearly 10,000 bird calls 
is housed at Cornell.
	
<P>"This tool is still in the testing stage, but we hope it will dramatically speed up the process of cataloging the worlds uncharted bird diversity," said Tom Schulenberg, leader of CIs Rapid Assessment Program and ornithologist with the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago.  "The CD will place the hard-won knowledge of brilliant ornithologists like Parker at the fingertips of the new generation of field scientists."




<A NAME="water"></A><H3>Water Pipeline Poses New Threat <BR>to Okavango Delta</H3>
Maun, Botswana: Namibia is in the grip of a severe drought, threatening the countrys water supply. To avert a water crisis in the capital city of Windhoek, the Namibian govern-ment is proposing to run a pipeline from the Okavango River, as soon as funding can be secured from international donors. Conservationists say that large-scale extractions via this pipeline will upset the delicate water cycle of Botswanas Okavango Delta, which is already at its 
lowest level in decades.
	

<P>"Water development schemes -- in Namibia, Angola, and Botswana -- pose one of the greatest threats to the future of the Okavango Delta," said Lee Hannah, CIs Director for Africa. Over the past ten months, conservationists have confronted several new threats to the delta, including a series of veterinary fences erected to prevent the spread of a contagious disease among cattle, and Namibias proposal for water withdrawal, which is being planned at a greatly accelerated rate. 
	
<P>"Any shift in the regions water-use patterns will have an impact on the deltas fragile ecology," said Karen Ross, Director of CIs Okavango Delta Program. "Its critical for the nations of the region to agree to significant limits on water withdrawal from the Okavango River to ensure the natural functioning of the delta ecosystem."
	
<P>The Okavango Delta, one of Africas greatest wetlands regions, is replenished each year by the food tide of the Okavango River. This food peak sustains the flora and fauna of the Okavango wetlands, and ultimately provides a livelihood to indigenous peoples.
	

<P>But the foods have been small for the past five years. This year, they have yet to reach the town of Maun, whose river has been dry for ten months.
 	

<P>"CIs chief concern is to ensure the integrity of the Okavango Delta at the same time that its benefts are equitably shared," said Hannah.  Hannah suggested that Namibia could explore options such as intensifed water recycling, water desalinization, and use of underground water. 
	 

<P>Botswana, Namibia, and Angola took a major step toward coordinated planning of the Okavango with the signing of the Okavango River Basin Water Commission Agreement 
in September 1994. The trinational commission (OKACOM) created by this agreement will recommend developments and investigate the impacts of surface and subsurface water development of the greater Okavango watershed.


<P>"The problem with Namibias new proposal is that it preempts the work of OKACOM," said Ross. "Not until OKACOM conducts a thorough river basin management study can the three countries agree on how to regulate water use."

<TD valign=top><H2>Pulsar Pledges $10 Million To<BR>Selva Lacandona Conservation</H2>

Monterrey, Mexico: Pulsar Internacional, S.A. de C.V., one of Mexicos largest companies, has committed $10 million to CI for conservation activities in the Selva Lacandona region over the next five years. The pledge made by Alfonso Romo, Pulsars chairman and CI board member, is the largest private gift ever for conservation efforts in Latin America.
	

<P>The Selva Lacandona --one of the last remaining 
North American rain forests and Mexicos highest conservation priority -- is under siege. The region has become the scene of intense disputes over access to land, where vying indigenous communities have already come to blows over dwindling resources.
	

<P>With increased competition for land, farmers are rapidly clear-cutting forests for crops and cattle-ranching. According to a study by the Mexican university ECOSUR, there will be no forest left in the state of Chiapas in 
48 years if deforestation continues at its current rate. The combined effects of economic pressures, ecological destruction, and population growth could threaten the stability of the entire region.
	

<P>Through Romos grant, CI, Pulsar, and local communities have formed a partnership to defuse the situation. A team of Pulsar engineers and scientists and CI staff will spear-head a new initiative to address the ecological and economic problems confronting the region and develop forest-friendly alternative activities in the Selva Lacandona.
	

<P>Pulsars research and development 
institution, the Center for Agricultural Studies, will establish experimental stations to identify improved agricultural techniques for local farmers. In the buffer zone surrounding the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve, farmers will learn 
to cultivate new, marketable crops. 
And the grant will reinforce CIs current projects through environmental education, construction of biological stations, policy initiatives, and microenterprise development. 
	
<P>"At Pulsar, we feel that the conservation of Mexicos natural resources is of the utmost importance, and we continually seek opportunities to improve our environment as well as our countrys prosperity," said Romo.
	

<P>Pulsar provides literacy and training programs for workers at its Chiapas operations, reflecting the companys commitment to cultivating the regions social, economic, and environmental resources. Pulsars program will help to stabilize the region and relieve 
the pressures on the already strained ecosystems of the Selva Lacandona. 


<A NAME="tech"></A><H3>Biosphere Reserves Forge Links Through Internet <BR>
and Powerful New Technologies</H3>
<P>	
Chiapas, Mexico: The first Biosphere Reserve Training Workshop in Central America was sponsored by CI, Intel Corporation and the United Nations Educational, Scientifc and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in July 1996. The three-week workshop equipped institutions in six biosphere reserves with Internet access, computers, and CIs conser-vation planning software, and provided intensive training to 13 experts in the use of these systems. The participating reserves included La Amistad in Panama, La Amistad 
in Costa Rica, Maya in Guatemala, Sierra del Rosario in Cuba, and Alto Golfo and Montes Azules in Mexico.
	

<P>The program will allow park managers and researchers to exchange information 
on the Internet and integrate conservation activities with partners on the local, regional, and global levels. "With these technologies, researchers can collect and process vast amounts of data and quickly share crucial information with colleagues around the world," said Intel Chairman Gordon Moore. CI will also continue to provide technical support 
to the biosphere reserve network.
	
<P>
The CI-Intel-UNESCO partnership will sponsor a series of biosphere reserve work-shops in Latin America, Asia, and Africa over the next year, including one in South America in September. The worlds 334 biosphere reserves, coordinated by UNESCO since 1976, are protected areas surrounded by buffer zones where scientific research and sustainable development activities are promoted.

<H3>Peru Declares National Park<BR>
in Tambopata Heath Region</H3>

<P>Lima, Peru: The government of Peru established the Bahuaja-Sonene National Park on the eastern slopes of the Andes in July 1996, granting permanent protection to some of the most biologically important territory on the planet. The 802,750 acre park includes the Pampas del Heath National Sanctuary and a part of Tambopata Candamo Reserved Zone, a tract of Amazonian rain forest harboring extremely high species diversity.
	

The declaration follows over a half-decade of intense work in the region. In 1990, CIs Rapid Assessment Program documented the rich habitats of Tambopata and identified the area as a top global conservation priority. Since then, CI-Peru has helped bring together local communities, indigenous people, and nongovernmental organizations on an array of socioeconomic studies and sustainable enterprise projects -- including a successful Brazil nut industry -- to gain their commitment to a protected area.

<P>	
"We see the park as the focus for a social contract between the local people who support this park, conservationists, and the government," said Avecita Chicchn, director of CIs Peru Program. When CI first began work-ing in this region, local conservationists gained community support for the park proposal in exchange for economic alternatives to destructive land-use practices. 
	

<P>There is still much work to be done. "Creating Bahuaja-Sonene National Park is an important first step 
in setting aside the entire Tambopata Candamo area," said Rod Mast, CI Vice President for the Andes Region. "We are committed to continuing efforts to ensure that 
the entire 5,600 square-mile area eventually achieves national park status."

<A NAME="chall"></A><H3>CI Meets Challenge Grant Goal</H3>

<P>
Washington, DC: CI raised 
$1 million in just three months to complete a challenge grant launched by actor Harrison Ford and Intel Chairman Gordon Moore, both CI board members. 
In March, Ford and Moore pledged to match dollar-for-dollar all unrestricted contributions made to CI by June 30. A total of 1,767 individuals and 30 organizations contributed $1,085,000.

<P>"This exceptional display of commitment to the CI family 
will be instrumental in forging conservation partnerships across the globe," said CI Vice President of Development and Communications Karen Ziffer. "We would like to offer our sincerest thanks to Harrison, Gordon, and everyone who joined in this challenge."

<H3>Conservation Leader Joins CI Papua <BR>
New Guinea Staff</H3>

<P>
Port Moresby, PNG: Gai Kula, one of the foremost conservationists in Papua New Guinea, has become CIs new program director based in that country. Since 1992, Kula has been First Assistant Secretary for Nature Conservation in PNGs Department of Environment and Conservation, where he was responsible for all govern-ment biodiversity programs. "Gai is a visionary," said CI President Russell A. Mittermeier. "He was one of the first officials in PNG to recognize biodiversity conservation as an essential ingredient in his countrys overall development strategy."

<P>
With more than 21 years in PNGs wildlife management program, Kula has become one of the chief architects of the regions biodiversity policy. In the last few years, he has led IUCNs Regional Council for the Pacific and chaired the Global Environment Facility Consultative Working Group.

<P>PNG is the most biologically diverse country in the Pacific region and one of the worlds top 15 megadiversity countries, housing some of the worlds greatest expanses of tropical rain forest and coral reefs. These riches are being squandered as logging activ-ities spread: Between 1980 and 1993 annual wood exports from PNG quadrupled from 642,000 cubic meters of logs to 2.7 million cubic meters -- equal to about three million trees.

	<CENTER><H2>NEW PRIMATE SPECIES DISCOVERED IN BRAZIL</H2>
	<H3>Marmoset More Proof Of Tropics' Biological Riches   </H3>
</CENTER>

<P>
	Washington, D.C. -- The discovery of a new species of marmoset in South America's tropical rain forest was announced recently by the scientific community in Brazil.
<P>
	"Finding a new beetle in the rain forest may not be surprising, but a new primate species is extraordinary," said Russell A. Mittermeier, president of Conservation International and chairman of the World Conservation Union Species Survival Commission, Primate Specialist Group.  "This discovery attests to the vast diversity of life on earth that remains unknown to us and shows how ignorant we still are of our fellow species -- even a well-studied group such as our closest relatives, the primates."  
 
	The new species is named Callithrix saterei, for a group of Indians indigenous to the central Brazilian Amazon area where the marmoset was discovered.  The small, squirrel-sized primate is distinct from its closest relatives, with physical traits such as unpigmented skin on the face and ears, and golden orange color.
<P>
	Its description, written by Jos de Sousa Silva Jnior and Maurcio de Almeida Noronha, will soon be published in the Brazilian scientific journal Goeldiana.
 
	Six new species of primates have been discovered in Brazil since 1990, bringing the total number of primate species in Brazil to 75, the highest in the world, more than double Indonesia, Madagascar or Zaire.  Although wild primates occur in 92 countries, these four countries account for nearly 70 percent of all 250 primates species worldwide, with Brazil alone accounting for almost 30 percent.
<P>
	Through science, economic development and community involvement, Conservation International works to protect global biodiversity, focusing on ecological hotspots in more than 21 countries on four continents.

Endangered Ecosystems </H2></CENTER>

<P><CENTER><H3>Conservation International Presentation
 Highlights Frederik Meijer Gardens Event</H3> </CENTER>     

<P>GRAND
RAPIDS, MI -- How can butterflies help save endangered rain forests?

<P>
Conservationist and scientist Roderic B. Mast, a native
of South Haven, Mich., will share experiences of a leading international
environmental group to answer that question in a talk at Frederik
Meijer Gardens March 15. 

<P>Mast is vice president of the
Andes Regional Program with Conservation International (CI), a
Washington, D.C.-based environmental group that works to protect
global biological diversity.  Mast's remarks will be part of a
special event marking the opening of the botanic gardens' &quot;Butterflies
are Free&quot; exhibit, which will run March 16 through March
31. 

<P>Just as economics drive much of the environmental
destruction the world faces today, economics must play a key role
in turning the tide,&quot; Mast says.  &quot;Butterflies happen
to offer one example of how this approach can work.&quot; 

<P>By
focusing on the world's biological diversity &quot;hotspots,&quot;
CI targets regions with the highest numbers of animals and plants
species that also face the greatest risk of habitat destruction.
 A field based group, CI has projects in more than 20 countries
on four continents. 

<P>Conservation International
integrates economics, science, policy work and community development
to build lasting solutions to the global ecological devastation
taking place today,&quot;  says Peter Seligmann, CI Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer, who also is attending the event.  &quot;With
tropical deforestation taking place at 40 million acres a year,
and species extinctions at an estimated rate of 27,000 per year,
the challenge is critically urgent.

<P>One example
of creating economic alternatives to rain forest destruction is
in Mexico's Chajul region, where CI helped start a 120 acre butterfly
reserve that today is run by the local community and provides
employment to some 35 people. 

<P>The project includes collection,
identification for research and sales to collectors in the United
States and Japan.  Artisans in the region also use the butterflies
in mobiles and glass containers for sale as souvenirs. 

<P>By
helping develop small enterprises that become self-sustaining,
CI gives local communities an incentive to protect the rain forest,
which might otherwise be sold off to loggers or cut down for temporary
farming plots or as fuel wood,&quot; Mast explains. 

<P>CI
has established several conservation enterprises linking rain
forest communities to international markets, including a Brazil
nut project in Peru, bioprospecting for potential medicinal sources
in Suriname, and the harvest of personal care product ingredients
from the rain forests of Guatemala. 

<P>CI's Tagua Initiative&Ocirc;
project in Ecuador markets buttons and jewelry made from the ivory-like
tagua nut in Ecuador's rich rain forests.  The project has generated
1,800 local jobs, including high-quality artisans who craft hand-carved
buttons and jewelry for export.  The project has provided income
for local transportation equipment and training for local people
in accounting and business management.  U.S. manufacturers that
purchase buttons through the initiative include the Gap, Esprit,
Timberland, and Smith and Hawken. 

<P>Grand Rapids attorney
Richard F. Vander Veen, III, of the firm Miller, Johnson, Snell
and Cummiskey, underscored the importance for the West Michigan
area to learn more about Conservation International's philosophy
and principles.   

<P>"West Michigan can greatly benefit
by embracing this philosophy of integrating science, economics,
policy and community development,&quot; Vander Veen said.  &quot;These
are essential elements toward achieving sustainable development,
and this is just as important to our local and the Great Lakes
economic growth concerns as it is for the conservation of international
ecological hotspots,&quot; Vander Veen said.   

<P>Mast will
speak at two presentations, one at 7:30 p.m. and the other at
8:30 p.m., during an event entitled, &quot;Where Have all the
Monarchs Gone,&quot; which previews the opening of the Tropical
Butterfly Release beginning March 16 at the botanic gardens. 
Other speakers will include Patricia Steijn Hopkinson, Chief Operating
Officer, Federik Meijer Gardens; Rick Sullivan, Executive Director,
Center for Environmental Studies; and Sr. Alvaro Umana, former
Secretary of Agriculture for Costa Rica. 

<P>The Federik
Meijer Gardens are located at 3411 Bradford Street, N.E.  For

<CENTER><H2>New World Record For Tree Diversity</H2></CENTER>

<BR>

ESPIRITO SANTO, BRAZIL  Brazilian scientists from the state of Espirito Santo announced this week a new world record for tree diversity.  Dr. Sergio Lucena Mendes, Director of the Museu de Biologia Professor Mello Leitao in Santa Teresa, Espirito Santo, reported the results of a study by Luciana Dias Thomaz of the Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP) that found 476 tree species in a one hectare (2.5 acre) plot in Santa Teresa.   This astounding discovery breaks the previous records of 458 found in the southern part of the state of Bahia immediately to the north of Espirito Santo along the Brazilian coast in March 1993 and 473 found in Cuyabeno, northeast Amazonian Ecuador in June 1993.  Prior to the Bahian study, no one had ever found more than 400 species per hectare. <P>
Not only did Ms. Thomaz discover this incredibly high number of species, she also found 104 species that had never before been found in the Atlantic forest region of Brazil, five species entirely new to science and possibly a genus new to science as well.  By comparison, the average hectare plot of temperate forest may have between two and 20 tree species.
<P>
The criteria used in the Espirito Santo study were more rigourous than those used in Bahia and Cuyabeno.  In the Bahia and Cuyabeno study, the cutoff criterion for inclusion in the count was 5 centimeters diameter breast height, a standard measure used in botanical studies.  In the Espirito Santo study, the criterion was 20 centimeter circumference at breast height, or 6.4 centimeter diameter breast height.  <P>
The Espirito Santo site is located in the municipality of Santa Teresa at an altitude of 600-800 meters, compared to 100-200 meters at the Bahian site and 260 meters at the Cuyabeno  site.  The site is within the Atlantic forest region of eastern Brazil, one of the world's top threatened hotspots for terrestrial biodiversity.  The Atlantic forest once occupied about 1.2 million square kilometers, or an area about three times the size of the state of California, but is now down to 2-5% of its original extent.  Estimates of total plant diversity for the Atlantic forest as a whole run as high as 20,000 species, half of which are endemic to Brazil.  The area is also rich in fauna as well, with 261 species of mammals, 620 species of birds, and 260 amphibians, of which 73 mammals, 160 birds and 128 amphibians are endemic. <P>   
The Espirito Santo findings were announced at a meeting in Porto Seguro, Bahia, where scientists are developing a plan for major corridors between protected areas in the Atlantic forest.  This innovative program is funded by the Pilot Program of the G7, currently being designed by scientists from Conservation International, the Wildlife Conservation Society, and the Brazilian Institute of the Environment (IBAMA), in collaboration with many local partners.
<P>
Dr. Russell Mittermeier, President of Conservation International, which has a large program in Brazil, said that this finding once again shows how incredible the biodiversity of a megadiversity country like Brazil actually is, and how little we still know about its diversity.  Fortunately, Brazil has become one the world's leaders in biodiversity research and conservation at both the governmental and non-governmental levels.  <P>
Dr. Sergio Lucena Mendes, who supervised the plant diversity project, said that this discovery stimulated his institution to develop a more detailed action plan for biodiversity inventory of other groups in addition to plants.  An excellent example of one of the most active scientifically-based conservation NGO's in Brazil, the Museu de Biologia Professosr Mello Leitao gives much reason for optimism for the future of biodiversity conservation in Brazil.

<CENTER><H2>Corridors For Conservation<BR>
Brazil Launches New Approach To Protect Rain Forests
</H2></CENTER>

<BR>
<CENTER>
<TABLE CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 WIDTH=450><TD>MANAUS, Brazil  An innovative rain forest conservation approach that focuses on large corridors of forest could ultimately protect more than 75 percent of Brazil's tropical  biodiversity in just 20 percent of its land area.
<P>
In two recent meetings, Brazilian scientists and conservationists, along with a number of international experts and donor agencies, designed two major conservation corridors for the Central Brazilian Amazon and Brazil's central Atlantic forest. 
<P>
"Corridor conservation solves the dilemma of habitat fragmentation, and its critical, adverse impact on evolution and ultimately on species survival," said Dr. Russell A. Mittermeier, president of Conservation International, who attended the meetings in Brazil.  "The reality is that many parks and other protected areas have become isolated islands in an ocean of agricultural land or entirely degraded areas."
<P>
"This approach targets investments to priority areas, or corridors, instead of spreading relatively small amounts of money in the hundreds of areas decreed as protected areas,"  noted Dr. Gustavo Fonseca, vice president for <A HREF="../../fieldact/regions/brazreg.htm">Conservation International's Brazil Program</A>.  "The continuity aspect of the corridors is extremely important, allowing gene flow between the parks and reserves, increasing the likelihood of survival of the most extinction-prone species."
<P>
In a preliminary study, seven major corridors were identified, five in the <B>Brazilian Amazon</B> and two in <B>Brazil's Atlantic Forest</B>, totaling 500,000 kilometers, or an area equivalent in size to Spain.  Combined, the conservation of these corridors would ensure protection of more than 75 percent of Brazil's tropical forest biodiversity in 20 percent of the country's land area.   Some $36 million is designated for the project through a <A HREF="http://www.worldbank.org" TARGET="main">World Bank</A> pilot program, with Germany and the European Union the principle financial supporters.  
<P>
The Atlantic Forest site focuses on that region's highest level of biodiversity in a corridor 
which covers 64,000 kilometers and includes eight federal Environment Protection Areas, 
<P>



12 federal parks and reserves, four agricultural field stations, four major forest tracts belonging to cellulose production companies, 11 indigenous reserves and several privately protected areas, known in Brazil as <B>Natural Heritage Private Reserves</B>.  The total area occupied by these protected forests totals 4,000 kilometers, or close to 60 percent of the remaining continuous habitat in this highly devastated region of the Atlantic forest.
<P>
Brazil's Atlantic forest region is generally considered one of the four or five highest priority threatened <A HREF="../../fieldact/hotspots/hotspots.htm">"hotspots"</A> for terrestrial biodiversity on Earth, along with <A HREF="../../fieldact/regions/madagasc.htm">Madagascar</A>, the <A HREF="../../fieldact/regions/philippi.htm">Philippines</A> and the <A HREF="../../fieldact/regions/ttareg.htm">Tropical Andes</A>.  It once covered about 2 million kilometers, or an area about three times the size of the state of California.  However, it was the first region of Brazil to be colonized, and was developed into the agriculture and industrial center of the country.  Today it has among the highest human populations in the Western Hemisphere, including both Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, the second largest city in the world.  Only about 2 to 5 percent of the original habitat remains intact.
<P>
The Atlantic forest claims 620 species of birds and 20,000 species of plants (half of them endemic)  numbers that rival the total diversity of the United States. The region has a high concentration of endangered  species, including the colorful lion tamarins and the largest of the New World primates, the muriqui.   Brazil is home to the highest totals of terrestrial and freshwater diversity on Earth as well as more than one third of all tropical rain forests.  It holds several biodiversity world records, including 55,000 plant species,  524 mammal species, 76 primate species and 70 parrot and macaw species.  Conservation of Brazil's magnificent and globally important biodiversity, particularly in the Amazon rain forest, has been a global concern for decades. Brazil's high profile has catalyzed worldwide concern for tropical forests.
<P>
Implementation of the corridor concept will involve Brazil's federal and state government, local and international non-governmental groups, indigenous groups and the private sector. A management body currently being discussed to oversee the corridors is a non-governmental foundation that would include stakeholders from all sectors.  The role of the private sector will be particularly important, since it holds some of the largest remaining tracts of land in the Atlantic forest corridors.  There is an increasing common interest between the conservation community and some of the most important industries in this region of Brazil, in particular the rapidly growing ecotourism industry.
<P>
"The central corridor of the Atlantic forest combines tropical reef, rain forest and beach in a way that few places in the world can match," noted Mittermeier.  "Another example of such reef-rain forest interface and its great appeal is Australia's north Queensland, where the ecotourism industry is well developed."</TD></TABLE></CENTER>

<CENTER><H2>Ecoescuela Becomes First Community-owned Enterprise
</H2>

<H3>Teachers and House Mothers Assume Management Role
</H3>


</CENTER>

<BR>

SAN ANDRES, GUATEMALA --   The first community-owned enterprise that promotes conservation in the Maya Biosphere Reserve is now established  in Guatemala.  The EcoEscuela de Espanol, which offers Spanish language classes and environmental education to foreign students will be turned over to an independent corporation of teachers and house mothers this weekend.  
<P>
In 1993, Conservation International (CI), the U.S. Agency for International Development and the San Andres community opened  the EcoEscuela as an environmentally friendly economic alternative for unemployed teachers and householders in town.   The school was designed to promote political support for conservation in the municipality of San Andres as it provides a unique opportunity for students to learn the Spanish language and about Mayan culture and history as well as Guatemala's incredible biological diversity.                                                                     
<P>
The EcoEscuela is the first enterprise to spin-off from Conservation International.   Other enterprises are expected to result from CI's current work in Guatemala , assisting local communities to successfully manage their own small businesses. 
<P>
Located in  the San Andres municipality, a gateway community to the Maya Biosphere Reserve and the county seat for the largest municipality in Guatemala, the EcoEscuela  offers a high profile for successful integration between community members and local authorities.  For example, when cattle owned by a local rancher encroached upon the school's ecological preserve, house mothers  organized a group to alert the municipal government.    The result was an official order to the rancher to remove his cattle from the area.  
<P>
"The ambitious work of the house mothers reflects a growing conservation awareness in San Andres," said Carlos Soza, CI's Guatemala Director.  "The house mothers recognized that EcoEscuela is an economic alternative promoting positive change, and took the steps to transform the school into a permanent institution."
<P>
The EcoEscuela  generates income directly for 60 families and indirectly for dozens more, employing more people than the existing saw mill in San Andres.  This income allows families  to continue their participation in the EcoEscuela and to ensure its success.  Staff members have been taught accounting and business management in order to run the school efficiently.  
<P>
Over the past three years, student enrollment has increased from 100 to more than 600, and the staff have launched several community conservation programs, including a reforestation project and an interpretive nature trail.  
<P>
"The teachers have demonstrated strong ownership to EcoEscuela and through their hard work have successfully helped this school become an independent, well-managed organization,"            said Alex Cano, Director of EcoEscuela.
<P>
As a former students, Jennifer Ito states, "Everyday held unlimited opportunities to learn something new; whether it was a new Spanish word, a new medicinal use of a plant, or a cultural difference."
<P>
"We are proud of the EcoEscuela and what is has done for our community," said Dalia de Puga, one house mother.  "It is helping us preserve a healthy environment and economy for our children.  This is why we have taken the EcoEscuela into our own hands."
<P>
Through science, economic development and community involvement, Conservation International works to conserve global biological diversity in ecological hotspots  those areas of the world with the highest numbers of species at greatest risk.  CI has projects in more than 20 countries on four continents.

<H3>Hotspots Map Offers Solutions<BR>To Global Species Extinction Crisis</H3>
</CENTER>

<P>
Washington, D.C. --  Conservation International (CI) today released a new Global Biodiversity Hotspots Map that reveals more than 50 percent of the Earth's terrestrial biological diversity is contained within less than 2 percent of the planet's land surface.
<P>
"While the world keeps hearing scientific predictions of species extinction crises,  we're saying it's time to put aside the gloom and doom and get down to the business at hand.  This new map makes the biodiversity crisis much more manageable,"  said Dr. Russell A. Mittermeier, CI President and an expert on primates and reptiles.
<P>
Based on an analysis carried out over the past year, CI's Global Biodiversity Hotspots Map lists 17 priority areas, occupying a total of less than 2 percent of the Earth's land surface.  Almost 40 percent of all  terrestrial plants and 25 percent of terrestrial vertebrate species are endemic to these areas (i.e. found nowhere else).  When considering total species diversity in these areas, they claim more than 50 percent of the Earth's terrestrial biodiversity. 
<P>
British ecologist Norman Myers created the biodiversity hotspots concept in two scientific papers published in 1988 and 1990.  Myers recognized that a modest number of hotspot ecosystems covering a small total land area, most often in tropical forest areas, accounted for a high percentage of global biodiversity.  CI slightly revised the concept and adopted it as the organization's conservation strategy. The same year, the Chicago-based MacArthur Foundation, a major private supporter of conservation initiatives, adopted the hotspots approach as its principal strategy for biodiversity investment.
<P> 	
"I wanted to know how we could get ahead of the game and determine which are the real priorities areas in the world," Myers said.  "I can think of no other biodiversity initiative that could achieve so much at such comparatively small cost, as the hotspots strategy."
<P>  
Two criteria were used to determine which areas qualify as a global biodiversity hotspot: number of endemic species and degree of threat.  Each of the priority hotspots claims at least 1 percent of the total diversity of vascular plants (those with roots and stems) as endemic, that is at least 2,500 species. Degree of threat was determined by the percentage of remaining habitat within a region, with each hotspot retaining less than 25 percent of its original natural habitat.
<P>
The top priority global biodiversity hotspots are:  
<UL>
<LI>the Tropical Andes (Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia)
<LI>the island of Madagascar
<LI>Cape and Western Cape floristic region (South Africa)
<LI>the Antilles
<LI>Western Sunda region  (Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei)
<LI>Eastern Sunda region (Indonesia)
<LI>the Philippines
<LI>the Atlantic forest (Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina)
<LI>Brazil's Cerrado
<LI>the Dari&eacute;n (Panama), the Choc&oacute; (Colombia-Ecuador), and Western Ecuador
<LI>Meso-American forests
<LI>Polynesia and Micronesian Island complex, including Hawaii and Fiji
<LI>Southwestern Australia
<LI>the Eastern Mediterranean region 
<LI>the Western Ghats (India) and the island of Sri Lanka
<LI>New Caledonia
<LI>the Guinean forests of West Africa (under final study)
</UL>
Another list of second-tier biodiversity hotspots is under preparation.  This list currently includes, in the United States, the California Floristic Province, which extends from southern Oregon to the Baja Peninsula.
<P>
"We are not saying focus only on these hotspots and ignore every thing else,"  said Mittermeier.  "Every nation's biodiversity is critically important to its future, and must be the most fundamental component of any national development strategy.  However, biodiversity is not evenly distributed on the planet, and some areas, particularly the tropics, harbor far greater concentrations of biodiversity. We recommend that these threatened hotspots receive international attention."
<P>
	As part of its conservation strategy, CI also recognizes the importance of  major tropical wilderness areas, such as Amazon.  The primary difference between hotspots and wilderness areas is the degree of threat.  Whereas less than 25 percent of natural vegetation remains in the hotspots (some have less than 10 percent of their original habitat), wilderness areas claim at least 75 percent undisturbed natural vegetation, with a human population density of no more than five persons per square kilometer. 
<P>
 "The Global Biodiversity Hotspots Map is powerful tool to help chart the course for biodiversity conservation, said Peter A. Seligmann, CI Board Chairman. "It can help guide investments through this critical era for life on Earth.  By demonstrating that something can actually be accomplished, we should be able to stimulate further investment, and encourage much greater involvement by the private sector, international aid agencies and development banks."

<H2>Pulsar Internacional to Donate $10 Million<BR>
	To Conservation International</H2>
</CENTER>




	<CENTER><H3>Contribution to Support the Preservation of Mexican Forests
</H3></CENTER>

	<P>MONTERREY, MEXICO -- Pulsar Internacional, SA of C.V., one of Mexico's largest companies, announced today its plans to donate $10 million over the next five years to Conservation International (CI), a group dedicated to the conservation of the world's natural resources.  The money donated by Pulsar will support the preservation of Mexican forests in the Selva Lacandona region of the Mexican state of Chiapas.  This donation represents one of the largest private gifts ever for conservation efforts.  

	<P>Considered by the Mexican government to be the highest conservation priority in the country, the Selva Lacandona has been increasingly threatened by destructive practices such as clear cutting and over-grazing.  The region is exceeded only by Brazil, Colombia and Indonesia in its biological richness and represents an important conservation opportunity to preserve Mexico's natural resources.

	<P>"At Pulsar, we feel that the conservation of Mexico's natural resources is of the utmost importance, and we continually seek opportunities to improve our environment as well as our country's prosperity," said Alfonso Romo, Chairman and CEO of Pulsar Internacional.  "As Mexican citizens, it is our responsibility to find solutions to the environmental issues that face the communities in which we operate."


	<P>A team of engineers and scientists from Pulsar and Conservation International will spearhead the conservation projects focused on the Selva Lacandona region.  Pulsar's research and development center, Centro Internacional de Investigacin Agropecuaria (CIICA), will establish experimental areas within the Selva Lacandona to identify agricultural techniques that will improve the quality and yields of trees and crops cultivated by the local farmers.

	<P>Pulsar's contribution will fund CI's programs that teach Selva Lacandona farmers how to support themselves through means that are conservation friendly.  Farmers will learn to work the land in a buffer zone surrounding the forest with a particular focus on cultivating bamboo, or "hule," African palms and ornamental plants.  

	<P>"We are delighted that Pulsar recognizes the Selva Lacandona as one of the world's most vital areas in need of natural resource conservation," said Peter Seligmann, Chairman and CEO of Conservation International.  "Pulsar's contribution will greatly expand CI's programs that involve local residents with our ongoing efforts to protect the environment."

	<P>Pulsar's donation extends the company's ongoing commitment to the protection of the world's natural resources and wildlife.  Pulsar currently plants Guadua angustifolia trees in Tabasco to protect the endangered Mangle tree.  The new trees have a greater yield and are used to supply housing in the region.  And Pulsar's organization, Aquilla and Ara, is devoted to the protection of endangered species of birds, including the Mexican eagle, the macaw and the parrot.

	<P>CI is an international organization dedicated to conserving the world's biological diversity.  In more than 20 countries in which it works, CI brings together all stakeholders -- scientists, local and indigenous communities, non-governmental organizations, government officials -- to create realistic conservation strategies, including economic development projects that sustain the local environment.

	<P>Created by Alfonso Romo in 1981, the Pulsar family of companies thrives on an entrepreneurial spirit that fosters a global strategic vision and commitment to dynamic leadership and growth.  With its roots in Monterrey, Mexico, Pulsar's companies generate sales in more than 110 countries around the world, with laboratory and production facilities in over 36 countries.  Pulsar employs 25,000 corporate employees and 66,000 workers indirectly through its agricultural business.  Its businesses include financial services, agriculture, agrobiotechnology, packaging, consumer goods distribution and new ventures.  In 1996, Pulsar's global sales will exceed $2 billion.

	<H2><CENTER>More Animals at Risk of Extinction</CENTER></H2>  

	<H3><CENTER>New Scientific Assessment Reveals Global Biodiversity<BR>
	At Greater Risk Than Previous Data Revealed </CENTER></H3>


	<P>Washington, D.C. -- Fully a quarter of all known mammal species are at risk of extinction, according to the most comprehensive scientific assessment of threatened species ever produced -- the 1996 IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals.  (The Red List is available for $40 from <A HREF="http://www.islandpress.com">Island Press</A>.)
	

<P>For the first time, all known mammals were assessed for their conservation status,  revealing a much greater number threatened with extinction than previously believed.  Until this assessment, the status of birds was used to estimate other species' levels of endangerment, because birds were the only species fully assessed.  The Red List classifies 11 percent of all known bird species as threatened with extinction. The finding that mammals are even more seriously threatened with extinction increases the urgency of global conservation measures.  Of  the reptiles, amphibians and fish assessed, estimates of those threatened with extinction are: 20 percent of reptiles, 25 percent of amphibians, and 34 percent of fish, mostly freshwater species.
	

<P>The Species Survival Commission (SSC) and its co-publishing partner Conservation International (CI) announced these findings in Washington, D.C. today.  The document will be available on the World Wide Web as of Oct. 7 at <A HREF="http://www.iucn.org/themes/ssc/index.html" TARGET="new">http://www.iucn.org/themes/ssc/index.html</A>.


	

<P>"The Red List is actually a red flag, warning us about the perilous status of animals and drawing attention to threats such as habitat destruction, pollution, over-harvesting and the introduction of non-native species," said George Rabb, chair of  the SSC, a volunteer global  network of scientists.
 	

<P>"This scientific assessment is indisputable proof that warnings about global biological diversity loss haven't been exaggerated -- if anything we've been too optimistic," said Russell A. Mittermeier, Conservation International president and chair of the SSC's Primate Specialist Group.
	

<P>More rigorous criteria were used to assess the conservation status of species for the 1996 List, which includes for the first time information about threats.  The new system provides alternative approaches to assessing threat, such as population decline, fragmentation of populations or low population numbers.  More than 500 scientists provided data and carried out the List assessments, with SSC partners BirdLife International, The Nature Conservancy and the World Conservation Monitoring Centre being major contributors as well.
 	

<P>The List identifies 5,205 species as threatened with extinction. Different objective approaches were used to assess levels of endangerment, including rate of population decline over a ten-year period.  Using this criterion, critically endangered species have experienced an 80 percent decline; endangered, 50 percent; and vulnerable, 20 percent decline. 
	 

<P>Of the 26 orders of mammals, 24 include threatened species, and the six largest orders have more than 50 threatened species each. The highest proportion of threatened species are in the orders that include monkeys and apes, 46 percent;  shrews and moles, 36 percent;  pigs, antelope and cattle, 33 percent; bats, 26 percent;  wild dogs, bears and cats, 26 percent; and rodents, 17 percent.  Other, smaller orders are also highly threatened,  including the order with horses, tapirs and rhinos, with 22 percent critically endangered.
	

<P>Of  the 27 orders of birds, 23 contain threatened species.  The five orders with the highest percent of threatened species are those that include rails and cranes, 26 percent; pheasants and partridges,  25 percent;  parrots,  25 percent; pigeons and doves, 17 percent; and kingfishers and bee-eaters, 12 percent.
	

<P>Among reptiles, of the 23 species of crocodilians (crocodiles, alligators, caimans), 44  percent are threatened.  While this figure is high, crocodilians are one of the few orders that have improved in status due to conservation measures.   In 1971, all 23 species of crocodilians were endangered.  Today, seven species are abundant enough to allow sustainable use for the skins trade, and five species have stable or increasing populations.
	

<P>More than 100 species of marine fishes were added to the 1996 Red List, including sharks, tuna, coral reef fish and seahorses.  While the status of the remaining 14,000 marine species have yet to be assessed, the recent additions indicate that many marine species could be at higher risk than previously thought.  All species of sturgeons and paddlefish were found to be threatened or near threatened.  Many freshwater species from other groups are also classified as threatened because land use changes have led to the deterioration of freshwater habitats worldwide.
	

<P>While most animal species are invertebrates, the Red List points out that very few have been assessed relative to their total numbers.  Those that have received the most attention are crustaceans, insects and molluscs, with more threatened molluscs included in the Red List than any other invertebrate group.  Out of 70,000 documented mollusc species, some 2,049 species were assessed, of which 920 were identified as threatened.
	 

<P>The United States is among the top 20 countries with the most threatened species of mammals,  and among the top 10 with the most threatened species of birds.  The top five countries with the most threatened number of mammals include Indonesia, China, India, Brazil and Mexico.  The top five with the most threatened species of birds are Indonesia, Brazil, China, the Philippines, and India.
	

<P>The most significant threat to the majority of species at risk of extinction was found to be habitat reduction, fragmentation and degradation, reflecting human population growth combined with economic development.  A surprisingly important factor was introduction of non-native species, along with exploitation, pollution and climate change.
	

<P>The Red List originated in 1960 as a set of index cards containing information on 34 mammals on file at the SSC Secretariat in London.  The 1996 Red List marks three decades of international efforts for the conservation of the world's biodiversity, and its publication coincides with the World Conservation Congress of IUCN-The World Conservation Union, to be held in Montreal, Canada, October 13-23, 1996. 
	

<P>The SSC is one of six commissions within the IUCN (the International Union for the Conservation of Nature).  The SSC works to conserve biological diversity with programs to study, save, restore and manage wisely species and their habitats.  The SSC volunteer network includes more than 7,000 scientists, field researchers, government officials and conservation leaders from 179 countries.
	


	

<P>The 1996 Red List was made possible, in part, due to a generous grant from the Margot Marsh Biodiversity Foundation.

<P>

	Holiday shoppers can help protect endangered rain forests by purchasing items made available by Conservation International (CI).   Ingredients used to create <B>Forest Pure</B> personal care products and <B>Enchanted Gold</B> holiday ornaments come from the rain forests of Central and South America and directly benefit the local people of rain forest communities by creating economic alternatives to deforestation.   
	<P>Forest Pure, a line of personal care products containing ingredients from CI's conservation project sites, is manufactured by <B>Nature's Gate Natural Products</B>.  Proceeds from the sales  support <BR>CI's Renewable Rain Forest Resources program.  Nature's Gate has created Forest Pure hair shampoo, hair conditioner, body lotion, body shampoo, soap and foaming bath products, all containing natural components found in  <A HREF="../../fieldact/regions/guatemal.htm">Guatemala</A> and <A HREF="../../fieldact/regions/peru.htm">Peru</A>. 
	<P>Forest Pure hair shampoo, foaming bath, and body shampoo contain jaboncillo, a natural sudsing ingredient used centuries ago by the <B>Maya Indians</B> of the Petn region of Guatemala.    Today local people still occasionally use the berries to wash their clothes.
	<P>Allspice extract, Brazil nut and cohune palm oils are used in Forest Pure hair  conditioner, lotions and foaming baths.   Allspice extract is derived from the oil found in the leaves and berries of an evergreen species native to Central America.  Its softening and conditioning properties make it a good source as an ingredient for conditioners, creams and lip balms. 


	<P>Cohune palm oil, also found in the <A HREF="../../fieldact/ecoescue/peten.htm">Petn</A> region of Guatemala, is extracted from a nut which grows on the wild and abundant cohune palm throughout the Petn.  Local people harvest the nuts and remove the woody outer shell that encloses the seed containing the oil.  This oil is very emollient and can be used as a replacement for coconut or mineral oil.  
	<P>Brazil nut oil is obtained from the nuts of Brazil nut trees in <BR>Peru's Madre de Dios region.    The high-quality oil is processed from nuts gathered in the wild by local people.  The oil's properties help maintain the protective barrier function of the skin and can improve the aesthetics of creams and lotions.
	<P>Production of gold-dipped rain forest leaves for holiday ornaments, created by Enchanted Gold, contributes to the conservation of the Maya Biosphere Reserve, the largest tract of rain forest remaining in Central America.  These striking and unusual leaves are hand-picked by rain forest dwellers in Guatemala's Petn region.   The leaves are strengthened with copper, and beautifully finished in 18 carat recycled gold. 	
	<P>A generous contribution is made by Nature's Gate and Enchanted Gold to Conservation International from sales of any Forest Pure hair shampoo, hair conditioner, lotion, soap, foaming bath or Enchanted Gold holiday ornament.  The proceeds will in turn be used to support CI's enterprise development  programs. 
	<P>Forest Pure and Enchanted Gold products can be ordered through <A HREF="../../../ced/products/markfram.htm" TARGET="_top">The Rain Forest Marketplace</A>, located on CI's web site.  Forest Pure products are also available at Fresh Fields organic supermarkets or in your local natural health food store carrying Nature's Gate personal care products.  Enchanted Gold holiday ornaments are available at Nature Company stores throughout the United States.

</H2></CENTER>

<P><CENTER><H3>Conservationists Welcome Peru's Creation of Bahuaja -Sonene Park<BR>
	As Important Step in Protecting Outstanding Biological Treasure
</H3></CENTER>

<BR>
<BR>

<P>
Washington, D.C. -- Some of the most biologically important territory on the planet gained permanent protection recently when the Peruvian government created the Bahuaja-Sonene National Park on the eastern slopes of the Andes.  Conservationists welcomed the park declaration as an important first step in a long-term goal to ensure that a major part of Peru's southeastern tropical forests receive permanent protection status.   
<P>
The 325,000 hectare (approximately 802,750 acre) park is located on the fringe of an area that holds extremely high single-site species diversity for woody plants, birds, mammals, butterflies, and dragonflies.  As many as 550 bird species and more than 1,200 butterfly species have been recorded at a single locality within the region, which ranks among the richest in species diversity on Earth.
<P>
"This is an important step not only for conservation in Peru, but for the entire world because of the uniqueness and biological richness of this area, " said Russell A. Mittermeier, president of Conservation International, a Washington, D.C.-based conservation group with offices in Lima, Peru.  "Bahuaja-Sonene is a critical link in the chain of protected areas in this region, and we commend the Peruvian government for its leadership in global conservation by taking this step."
<P>
Being adjacent to Bolivia's Madidi National Park,  the new park declaration means that some 2.25  million hectares of  tropical forest in this region are given permanent protection.  The new park covers  about a third of the original park proposal of 968,587 hectares, as well as an area already protected as part of the Pampas del Heath National Sanctuary. 
<P>
"Conservation International considers this park declaration part of a process that will lead to eventual protection of nearly one million acres of tropical forest on the Peruvian side.  When this ultimate goal is achieved, the combined area with Madidi will rank this among  the top three or four largest tropical forest protected areas in the world," Mittermeier added.

<P>
Since 1990, CI has worked to protect Peru's southeastern tropical forests, focusing specifically on the Tambopata region where the park is located. Partnering with local conservationists, CI's baseline research contributed ground-breaking evidence of the region's 
biological importance.  CI's Peru Program also helped bring together local community groups, indigenous people, and nongovernmental organizations to discuss the area's future.  The coalition strongly supported creation of the park as part of a sustainable development strategy to include ecologically sound economic activities for the local rural population.
<P>
 "For the past six years Conservation International and its local partners have worked for permanent protection for Tambopata and we are now closer to that goal. Conservation International will continue to work toward the permanent protection that the rest of this unique, biologically rich region deserves," said Avecita Chicchon, director of CI's office in Peru.
<P>
Through science, economic development and community involvement, Conservation International works to protect global biodiversity, focusing on ecological hotspots in more than 21 countries on four continents.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE="+2">E</FONT>cotourism is one of the fastest-growing segments of the world tourism industry, and for a growing number of countries, tourism based on natural attractions is a top earner of foreign exchange.
<P>
Given its economic power, tourism provides powerful incentives to government policy-makers and local people to conserve natural resources which attract outside visitors.  The immensity of the tourism industry, however, and the possibility of its explosive growth in a region, can overwhelm natural resources and community infrastructure.

<H2>Ecotourism</H2>

</CENTER>



<P>

The Ecotourism Program strengthens CI's efforts to promote economically and ecologically viable alternatives to destructive land use.  This strategy stresses sound policy and assists in long-term regional planning, provides training, and sponsors model site development.  To support these initiatives, CI develops alliances with key partners in the public and private sectors, provides technical assistance to regional program staff and local partners, and seeks project funding.   Ecotourism initiatives are now a significant component of the majority of CI's regional programs in 22 countries worldwide.  

<P>



<BR>



<H3>Examples of current activities include the following:</H3>

<P>

<A HREF="../../fieldact/regions/bolivia.htm">Bolivia</A>: CI is helping to develop indigenously owned, managed, and operated ecotourism and other small enterprises in the village of San Jos&eacute; and neighboring towns in and around the buffer zone of the Madidi National Park.  Enterprise development is based on the sound use and management of the area's resource base through ecotourism, agroforestry, indigenous handicraft production, and non-timber forest products extraction.

<P>

<A HREF="../../fieldact/regions/brazreg.htm">Brazil</A>: CI is sponsoring ecotourism workshops which train participants in ecotourism planning and product development.  The workshops are bringing together the private sector, nongovernmental organizations, interdisciplinary teams of planners, architects, environmental experts, market analysts, and members of the international conservation community.  The trainees then instruct other Brazilians at regional workshops.  The workshop format will be replicated for other CI in-country programs.

<P>

Another CI initiative is helping to provide the Kayap&oacute; Indian communities of Brazilian Amazon with sustainable economic alternatives to mining, and seeks to carefully redesign the current unsustainable timber harvesting practices in the region.  CI facilitated the creation of a permanent research station, the Kayap&oacute; Center for Ecological Studies, which will aid the development of a forest management strategy and non-timber forest products, and act as an ecotourism base for the area.

<P>

<IMG SRC="../../../resource/facts/ftour.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" width=250 height=86><A HREF="../../fieldact/regions/guatemal.htm">Guatemala</A>: CI is developing three alternative tourist routes to draw visitors into the spectacular, but rarely seen areas of the Maya Biosphere Reserve.  The route development involves several local communities and tour operators and benefits local villages and businesses.  CI is offering training so that local people may become tourism professionals.

<P>

The Eco-Escuela, a school located in the <i></i>San Andr&#233;s community, offers a unique combination of Spanish language instruction with an environmental curriculum.  Villagers receive income from teaching and housing students.  The school also serves as a means of drawing individuals to an area that might otherwise be bypassed and helps direct tourists to other nearby ecotourism sites.

<P>

<A HREF="../../fieldact/regions/ghana.htm">Ghana</A>:  As part of the USAID-sponsored project to develop tourism around Ghana's Kakum Nature Park, CI opened a canopy walkway last Earth Day (April 23, 1995).  The site has attracted more than 6,000 tourists to date.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>Debt-For-Nature Swaps</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>
In a debt-for-nature exchange, a conservation organization acquires some of a developing country's foreign debt, either by purchasing it at a discount from the debt's face value or by receiving it as a donation.  The organization then agrees to cancel the debt in return for the borrower country's commitment of additional resources to local conservation.
<P>
The first ever debt-for-nature exchange was initiated by Conservation International (CI) and the government of Bolivia in July 1987.  Since that ground-breaking transaction, CI has negotiated debt-for-nature swaps in Mexico, Costa Rica, Bolivia, and Madagascar.  Similar exchanges have been facilitated by the Dutch and Swedish governments, as well as a number of nonprofit organizations, including The Nature Conservancy and World Wildlife Fund.  To date, this type of transaction has extinguished nearly US $200 million of Third World debt and has delivered a substantial amount of new resources to conservation in Latin America and Africa.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>International Communications </H2>
</CENTER>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">B</FONT>ehind the success of
each of CI's regional programs is an enthusiastic public's commitment
to conserving biodiversity.  In 1995, CI's International Communications
Department has given ample proof of how effective its communications
strategies are in garnering national support for conservation.<P>
 International Communications focuses on reaching local communities
and national leaders facing decisions that will affect the future
of their nation's natural resources.  Expanding people's awareness,
defining the terms of public debate, and inspiring communities
with a sense of appreciation and &quot;ownership&quot; of biodiversity
are just some of this program's impact.       

<P><IMG SRC="../../../RESOURCE/SLIDES/COMM/Present.jpg" ALT="Present.jpg - 6.2 K" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=134 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=0 ALIGN=left>
To capture the attention
and affect the attitudes of national audiences, International
Communication strategies are built with media campaigns, video
documentaries, radio and television, printed materials, grassroots
education campaigns, and workshops.  These intensive campaigns
provide information about environmental decisions and create arenas
for national discussions.  Ultimately, these efforts are also
designed to influence national policymakers who make the crucial
decisions on protecting endangered ecosystems. 
<BR clear=all>
<P>
<H4>The Pantanal, Brazil</H4>

<P>
The Pantanal is the setting for a controversial river development
project called &quot;Hidrovia&quot; that could bring significant
changes to the ecology and economy of the world's largest wetland.
 Because the region's residents were by-and-large unaware of the
probable consequences of Hidrovia, International Communications
and CI-Brazil created an informational video.  <P>Filmed interviews
with more than 50 scientists, conservationists, ranchers, politicians,
businesspeople and residents were edited down to a 18-minute documentary
presenting the residents' and officials' viewpoints.  A key segment
recorded a high government official's statement that the Brazilian
government has made a commitment to &quot;leave the river as it
is.&quot;  


<P>
In December 1995, CI released &quot;Voices of the Pantanal
--The Hydrovia Story&quot; in Campo Grande, capital of the state
of Mato Grosso do Sul, and Cuiab&aacute;, capital of the State
of Mato Grosso.  Some 300 people, including many journalists and
local officials, attended both debuts.  <P>The documentary attracted
attention throughout the Pantanal region, resulting in four full-page
stories, as well as shorter articles, in regional newspapers,
and coverage by all ten TV stations in the two cities.  Universities,
schools, and NGOs are now showing the video, geometrically increasing
its reach. 


<P>
CI's documentary has significantly contributed to the
debate over Hidrovia, and the wider publicity triggered by the
video will make any change from the &quot;leave the river as it
is&quot; policy much more difficult. 

<P>
<H4>Madagascar </H4>

<P> At the beginning
of 1995, CI launched the documentary video, &quot;Fanamby: Green
Challenge for the Red Island,&quot;  in Madagascar.  Attended
by 120 guests including three ministers representing government,
media, and the conservation community, the release was widely
covered by Malagasy TV and newspapers.  The video aired on television,
and videotapes were distributed for showings at cultural centers
and other arenas throughout the nation. To maximize viewership,
InterCom produced &quot;Fanamby&quot; in French, Malagasy, and
English versions.  


<P>
In 1995 &quot;Fanamby&quot; won an award from
the Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival--widely considered one
of the two most important nature film festivals in the world.
 The Best Resourceful Production Award, which &quot;Fanamby&quot;
received, honors the best film produced for less than $50,000.
 The award also acknowledges CI's communications philosophy of
producing videos for national audiences -- rather than the international
entertainment market. &quot;Fanamby&quot; aims to help Madagascar
residents appreciate the richness of their natural heritage and
understand the importance of protecting their ecosystems.  CI
is the only international conservation organization producing
educational documentaries for in-country use. 

<P>Following the release
of &quot;Fanamby&quot; to the Malagasy public, International Communications
and CI-Madagascar will create a regional communications strategy
to support conservation efforts in Ankarafantsika. 

<P><H4>Greater Cartagena
Bay, Colombia </H4>  

<P>On Colombia's Caribbean Coast, the city of Cartagena
is a World Heritage Site, and a source of great pride and inspiration
to all Colombians.  Its beautiful colonial architecture and bay
containing mangrove forest, coral reefs, freshwater estuaries,
and dry forests have attracted visitors from all over the world.
 But the area is deteriorating, besieged by rampant pollution,
uncontrolled building and tourism, and population growth.  Only
a concerted effort will save what is left of the Bay's natural
surroundings. 

<P>In May 1995, encouraged and supported by CI board
member, Julio Mario Santo Domingo, International Communications
and CI-Colombia convened a creative workshop to stimulate thinking
on zoning and to design an education campaign for Greater Cartagena
Bay.  Thirty influential participants attended, including a former
mayor of Cartagena, the city's Secretary for the Environment,
the current Colombian Minister for the Environment, advertising
professionals, and conservationists.  <P>For six days, the team brainstormed
about how communications could inspire environmental solutions.
 This workshop resulted in the formation of Cartagena Convida,
a new group that will guide a five-year communications campaign
to catalyze efforts to protect the Bay.    

<P>Cartagena Convida,
now an independent NGO, is poised to launch its action plan for
a multifaceted campaign, including social and biological sciences,
theater and other nontraditional communications tools, information
and press, and advertising.

<H2>Making Biodiversity Work for Conservation</H2>

</CENTER> 



<BLOCKQUOTE><H3>The Challenge</H3> <P>One of the most critical and imminent threats to the earth's biodiversity is deforestation.  It is estimated that an area of tropical forest the size of Florida is lost to timber, mining, grazing, and other destructive forces every year.  In total, an area larger than the size of France has been deforested in the Amazon region alone, over 12% of the world's most diverse ecosystem.  This exponential rate of destruction leads to the marginalization and decline of indigenous cultures and the irreversible loss of genetic resources, two valuable national resources. 



<BR>



<H3>CI's Response</H3> 



<P><IMG SRC="../../../RESOURCE/SLIDES/POLICY/Biopros.jpg" ALT="Biopros.jpg - 5.3 K" WIDTH=134 HEIGHT=200 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=0 ALIGN=right>In an effort to turn the tide of this destruction, Conservation International is attempting to transform today's search for wild plants and organisms holding chemical and genetic building blocks for important new medicines and crops into a powerful conservation tool.  This search, known as bioprospecting, has a tremendous potential for conservation and stewardship over biodiversity resources.  To this end, CI has designed a bioprospecting program to foster incentives for conservation in tropical countries, illustrating to governments and forest peoples alike the economic potential of their genetic resources and the traditional knowledge.  The stakes are high.  The annual world market for plant-derived drugs is estimated at $200 billion. 



<BR>

CI has moved aggressively into the bioprospecting field.  We now have experience in initiating a major bioprospecting agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb, Suriname, and the National Institutes of Health. We have also broken new ground by assisting the governments of Madagascar and Indonesia in developing legislation governing access to genetic resources.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<STRONG>Rapid Assessment Program (RAP)</STRONG>
<P>
Conservation International's Rapid Assessment Program (RAP) was launched in 1987 to address the lack of scientific knowledge of Latin America's quickly disappearing tropical rain forests.  RAP was designed to be fast and inexpensive way to accurately define conservation priorities.  
<P>
RAP works by assembling teams of experienced, internationally recognized field biologists who work closely with host-country scientists to generate fast, on-the-ground assessments of areas suspected to be important biodiversity conservation sites.  To assess its biological importance, team members examine the area's biological diversity, degree of endemism, ecological uniqueness, and risk of extinction.  As a conservation tool, RAP precedes - but does not preclude - long-term scientific study.
<P>

	<STRONG>A new rapid approach to the identification and conservation of aquatic ecosystems.
</STRONG>




<P>
The state of knowledge about aquatic tropical ecosystems is weak in comparison with terrestrial ecosystems.  Despite this lack of information, major decisions affecting aquatic ecosystems are being made throughout the tropics.  AquaRAP assesses the conservation significance and status of key aquatic ecosystems.  A primary goal is to identify important regions for policy and decision makers and to make conservation recommendations that are locally appropriate and globally significant.


<P>
AquaRAP expeditions will analyze biological communities found in rivers, streams, lakes, springs or marshes, and adjacent environments that fall under aquatic influence such as floodplains and gallery forests.  The interface between aqua and terra and a hydrological overview will be principal to this broader context of the aquatic community, and is essential for conservation purposes.

<P>
In spite of contamination and depletion of fish populations, aquatic communities receive little conservation attention.  Fish provide the major source of protein for the majority of rural people throughout the wet tropics.  People who rely upon this source are severely impacted by deforestation, mercury pollution from gold mining, overfishing and elimination of large keystone predators such as giant otter and caiman.

<P>

Opportunities exist to facilitate change because many tropical countries such as Peru and Brazil are beginning to place a high priority on improving aquatic ecosystem conservation and belated science.  Collaboration with government agencies can now have a significant impact on the fate of these ecosystems.

<P>




AquaRAP has four important analysis levels:<P>
<OL>
  <LI><STRONG>Biodiversity and biogeographic significance</STRONG><BR>
		There is much uncertainty concerning the diversity of tropical fish faunas.  The Amazon Basin, the world's epicenter for freshwater fish has some  1500-1700 species described.  Recently it has been suggested that the actual species count might be as high as 9000 species.

	<P> 

 <LI><STRONG>Landscape ecology</STRONG><BR>
		Working beyond the body of water is crucial to this approach.  Maintaining the riparian corridor, as most indigenous cultures on blackwaters do, is crucial to human sustenance.  There are many associations between fish and trees in flooded forests.  Seasonal flooding is related to soil replenishment.  These interrelationships are critical for both aquatic and terrestrial organisms as well as the local economy.
<P>
  
<LI><STRONG>Physio-chemical analysis</STRONG><BR>
		The relationship between water chemistry, endemism and fish distribution is complex.  Such basics as how fish faunas differ between blackwater and whitewater systems are poorly known.  
<P>
 
<LI><STRONG>Human ecology</STRONG><BR>
		Human activities such as farming forestry, mining and fisheries are often major determinants of aquatic ecosystem health.  Indigenous societies have developed a number of adaptive systems that conserve aquatic fertility.  Recording this type of information is vital both for better scientific understanding and for documenting the human dependence on the resources and appropriate management.

</OL>
<P>
	
The first ever AquaRAP expedition  took  place in September, 1996 near Cobija, Bolivia.  An International RAP Team with scientists from Bolivia, Peru, Brazil and the United States spent three weeks surveying the systems of the Tahuamanu and Manuripi rivers.  The founding and initiation of AquaRAP has been substantially funded by the <A HREF="http://www.wajones.org"> W. Alton Jones Foundation</A>.  With further support AquaRAP could be implemented to fill information needs and help set conservation priorities around the world.  

<P>

AquaRAP is a collaboration between Conservation International and <A HREF="http://www.bvis.uic.edu/museum/">The Field Museum of  Chicago</A>.

<H2>Conservation Policy</CENTER></H2>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he 1992 Earth Summit marked a turning point in global awareness of biodiversity conservation. With new 
funds being made available for conservation, our challenge is to promote appropriate projects and lessen 
the impact of poorly designed international initiatives.  <P>CI's Policy Program reinforces the work of our 
field programs through policy, legal and economic analysis.  The department also works to create new 
approaches to conservation that cover finance mechanisms and bioprospecting, models for understanding the 
economic forces behind biodiversity loss, and improving the environmental performance of development 
institutions.
<P>Forces affecting conservation, including macroeconomic policy, land-use dynamics, and large-scale 
development assistance form the framework for our conservation actions. CI's Conservation Policy program 
is working to ensure that these forces support, not undermine, conservation efforts. <P>This means taking 
the lessons learned by CI's on-the-ground programs to world capitals and international forums; breaking 
new ground in fields like natural resource economics; and pioneering new approaches to funding 
conservation such as <A HREF="../../aboutci/strategy/dfnswap.htm">debt-for-nature</A> swaps and
 <A HREF="../../aboutci/strategy/biopros.htm">bioprospecting.</A>

<P>
In Washington, our challenge is to help maximize the potential for U.S. leadership on global environmental 
issues through international forums like the Biodiversity Convention, trade agreements like NAFTA, and 
major international initiatives like the 1994 Western Hemisphere Summit. 



<P>
<H3>Conservation Finance</H3>


Since creating the world's first debt-for-nature swap in 1987, CI has pioneered innovative financial mechanisms to fund conservation.
<P>

<UL>
<LI>CI is assisting the governments of Indonesia and Madagascar to create new laws governing the use of biological and genetic resources for pharmaceutical applications (commonly known as "bioprospecting.")
<P>
<LI>CI is assessing the legal and financial aspects of creating an investment fund for conservation enterprise projects.
</UL>

<P>
<H3>Legislative Policy</H3>
<P>

Since 1991, the Policy Program has helped to focus international agreements and institutions to work for biodiversity conservation on the ground.
<P>

<UL>
<LI>In Madagascar, CI is working with the United National's Development Programme to set up the country's top priorities for conservation investment as well as an environmental action plan for the country.
<P>
<LI>In cooperation with the Business Council for Sustainable Development, CI is analyzing the impacts of infrasturcture--particularly road-building--on biodiversity in South America.
<P>
<LI>In a study released in 1995, CI is proposing innovative legal tools and economic incentives that may break new ground for private sector participation in conservation.
</UL>

<P>
<H3>Resource Economics</H3>


Understanding the economic forces that drive biodiversity loss is essential to making the most conservation investments effective.  CI has targeted several strategically important ecosystems for economic assessments and conservation recommendations.

<UL>
<LI>In Bolivia's tropical forests, CI is evaluating the economic context for and environmental consequences of different forest management approaches in order to influence international and Bilivian forestry policy.
<P>
<LI>To protect the remnants of the threatened Atlantic Forest in Southern Bahia, Brazil, CI is surveying the economic value of the forest, biodiversity, watersheds, and the forces at play on local landowners to help them to derive sustainable incomes from environmentally benign land uses.
<P>
<LI>In Papua New Guinea and Guatemala, CI is reviewing proposed industrial timber concessions--both in terms of revenue distribution and conservation impacts.
</UL>

<P>
<H3>Highlights</H3>

<UL>
<LI>CI's policy work with USAID focused its efforts on biodiversity hotspots and major wilderness areas. 
CI also helped modify the Global Environment Facility's funding structure to accommodate 
small-to-medium-sized grant opportunities for nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).
<P>
<LI>In Suriname, CI is coordinating with the U.S. State Department and international institutions to 
provide technical assistance on timber concessions and development alternatives to the Surinamese government.
<P>
<LI>CI debt-for-nature swaps have converted more than $4.6 million in debt for conservation in Bolivia, 
Costa Rica, Madagascar, and Mexico over the past year and a half.

<P>
Tragically, many of the world's most biologically diverse regions are those that are most threatened by habitat destruction.  Recently, CI researchers took a highly significant step toward identifying habitats at greatest risk: They have for the first time charted data showing the distribution of human disturbance of ecosystems throughout the world.  The data are broken down into various levels of disturbance: predominantly natural ecosystems (green), partially disturbed areas (yellow), and human-dominated ecosystems (red) such as farms and cities.  Often, human disturbance creates an environmental "

<A HREF="../hotspots/hot97.htm">hotspot</A>."

<P>
One of the most striking features of this map is how much of the planet has been completely and irrevocably changed from its natural state--most of the United States and Europe, for example.  In contrast, there still are some large swaths of relatively undisturbed land, and some of them are in the tro../resource/icons.  These tropical wilderness areas--shown in green on the map--are an encouraging sign that there is still time to protect these ecosystems and their biological richness.

bibliography is to pull together literature from the various
disciplines.<P>

Items in <i>italics</i> represent what you might type.<P>

For this search option type the words you want to search on into the text box and click on the Search button. By default the words are assumed to be separated by the boolean operator AND so typing <i>analysis recreation</i> is the same as typing <i>analysis and recreation</i> and would retrieve citations that have both the words analysis and recreation. The boolean operators available are {AND OR NOT}. Typing <i>analysis not recreation</i> would retrieve citations that have the word analysis but don't have the word recreation. Operator order is from left to right so typing <i>analysis or study and recreation</i> would retrieve documents that have the words analysis and recreation or the words study and recreation. The search engine used recognizes words of the same root so a
document with the words studies and recreation would also be retrieved by the last search.<P>

Items in <i>italics</i> represent what you might type.<P>

For this search option you type the words you want to search on
into one or both of the text boxes and click on the Search button. 
Words typed into the same box are assumed to be separated by the 
boolean operator OR so typing <i>analysis study</i> into the first
 text box would retrieve citations that have the word analysis or 
the word study. You can choose the boolean operator {AND OR ANDNOT} 
with which to separate the words in the two text boxes. Typing 
<i>analysis study</i> into the first text box, selecting the AND operator, and typing
<i>recreation</i> into the second text box would retrieve citations
 that have the words analysis and recreation or the words study
 and recreation. The searches are literal so if you wanted the last search
 to pick up citations with the words studies and recreation you would have 
needed to type <i>analysis study studies</i> into the first text box. You 
can also use the wildcard character * so typing <i>stud*</i> would 
pick up study, studies, studied, among other words.<P>

Items in <i>italics</i> represent what you might type.<P>

For this search option type the words you want to search on into the text box and click on the Search button. By default the words are assumed to be separated by the boolean operator AND so typing <i>analysis recreation</i> is the same as typing <i>analysis and recreation</i> and would retrieve citations that have both the words analysis and recreation. The boolean operators available are {AND OR NOT}. Typing <i>analysis not recreation</i> would retrieve citations that have the word analysis but don't have the word recreation. Operator order is from left to right so typing <i>analysis or study and recreation</i> would retrieve documents that have the words analysis and recreation or the words study and recreation. The search engine used recognizes words of the same root so a
document with the words studies and recreation would also be retrieved by the last search.<P>

Items in <i>italics</i> represent what you might type.<P>

For this search option type the words you want to search on into the text box and click on the Search button. By default the words are assumed to be separated by the boolean operator AND so typing <i>analysis recreation</i> is the same as typing <i>analysis and recreation</i> and would retrieve citations that have both the words analysis and recreation. The boolean operators available are {AND OR NOT}. Typing <i>analysis not recreation</i> would retrieve citations that have the word analysis but don't have the word recreation. Operator order is from left to right so typing <i>analysis or study and recreation</i> would retrieve documents that have the words analysis and recreation or the words study and recreation. The search engine used recognizes words of the same root so a
document with the words studies and recreation would also be retrieved by the last search.<P>

Items in <i>italics</i> represent what you might type.<P>

For this search option you type the words you want to search on
into one or both of the text boxes and click on the Search button. 
Words typed into the same box are assumed to be separated by the 
boolean operator OR so typing <i>analysis study</i> into the first
 text box would retrieve citations that have the word analysis or 
the word study. You can choose the boolean operator {AND OR ANDNOT} 
with which to separate the words in the two text boxes. Typing 
<i>analysis study</i> into the first text box, selecting the AND operator, and typing
<i>recreation</i> into the second text box would retrieve citations
 that have the words analysis and recreation or the words study
 and recreation. The searches are literal so if you wanted the last search
 to pick up citations with the words studies and recreation you would have 
needed to type <i>analysis study studies</i> into the first text box. You 
can also use the wildcard character * so typing <i>stud*</i> would 
pick up study, studies, studied, among other words.<P>

Items in <i>italics</i> represent what you might type.<P>

For this search option type the words you want to search on into the text box and click on the Search button. By default the words are assumed to be separated by the boolean operator AND so typing <i>analysis recreation</i> is the same as typing <i>analysis and recreation</i> and would retrieve citations that have both the words analysis and recreation. The boolean operators available are {AND OR NOT}. Typing <i>analysis not recreation</i> would retrieve citations that have the word analysis but don't have the word recreation. Operator order is from left to right so typing <i>analysis or study and recreation</i> would retrieve documents that have the words analysis and recreation or the words study and recreation. The search engine used recognizes words of the same root so a
document with the words studies and recreation would also be retrieved by the last search.<P>

Items in <i>italics</i> represent what you might type.<P>

For this search option you type the words you want to search on
into one or both of the text boxes and click on the Search button. 
Words typed into the same box are assumed to be separated by the 
boolean operator OR so typing <i>analysis study</i> into the first
 text box would retrieve citations that have the word analysis or 
the word study. You can choose the boolean operator {AND OR ANDNOT} 
with which to separate the words in the two text boxes. Typing 
<i>analysis study</i> into the first text box, selecting the AND operator, and typing
<i>recreation</i> into the second text box would retrieve citations
 that have the words analysis and recreation or the words study
 and recreation. The searches are literal so if you wanted the last search
 to pick up citations with the words studies and recreation you would have 
needed to type <i>analysis study studies</i> into the first text box. You 
can also use the wildcard character * so typing <i>stud*</i> would 
pick up study, studies, studied, among other words.<P>

<TITLE>INPE's 1/4" TAPES FORMAT</TITLE>
<H1><HR>INPE's 1/4" Tapes Format<HR>
<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2></H1>
INPE distributes  the digital images  acquired by remote  sensing  satellites in two distinct formats : in the Super-Structure (also known as LTWG or CEOS) format or in Fast-Format (EOSAT).These two formats are described in manuals wich are distributed to the users along with the magnetic tapes.Their description applies basicaly to 1/2" tapes. For data recorded in 1/4" tapes, the format of the physical data recording differs slightly.
In this document the format differences between 1/2" and the 1/4" are pointed out.
<pre>
<H3>      </H3>
</pre>
<H1><H2>BLOCKS AND RECORDS</H2></H1> 
This document uses the terminology "blocks" and "records",wich are defined below.
BLOCK is set of data recorded in a tape using a single tranfer. The blocks, in the tapes, are separeted by "blank" spaces (IRG: inter-record gaps). A block may contain one or more RECORDS. 
RECORD is a logic set of data, for instance, a header or an image line.
The manuals describing the LTWG and Fast-Format do not make any distinction between blocks and records : in the 1/2" tapes, each block contains just one record and, hence, the definitions get mixed up.
In the 1/4" tapes, however, this distinction is important to understand the recording format.
<pre>
<H3>        </H3>
</pre>
<H1><H2>1/4" TAPES FORMAT</H2></H1>
The records in the 1/4" tapes are exactly the same as  those in the 1/2" tapes, as described in their manuals. However, in the 1/4" tapes, the records concentrate in blocks. The method of concatenation, and the size of the blocks, are decribed below : 
<OL>
<LI>Blocks size<p>
The blocks always have the same physical size, multiple of 512 bytes, and never exceed 16 kbytes.<H5>   </H5>
<LI>Concatenation of records in blocks<p>
The logical records are concatenated within the tape's physical blocks. Each logical record is completely contained within a single physical block, that is, a logical block is never recorded in 2 (or more) physical blocks.
Each logical record is preceeded by a field of 4 bytes wich contains the size of the record (in bytes), as shown below :<p>
<pre>
<H3>              </H3> 
----------------------------/\/---------------------------
|a| RL1            |b| RL2      |n| RLn          |O|  p  |
---------------------------/\/----------------------------
<H6>     </H6> 
<p>&lt----------------------&lt=16 KBytes-----------------------&gt
<H3>             </H3> 
</pre>
field a : 4 bytes containing a binary numerical value, of size (in bytes) equals to the logical record 1.(RL1)<p>
field RL 1 : logical record 1, of size (in bytes) described in field a.<p>
field b : 4 bytes containing a  binary numerical value, of size (in bytes) equals to the logical record 2. (RL2) <p>
field RL 2 : logical record 2, of size (in bytes) described in field b.<p>
field n : 4 bytes containing a binary numerical value, of size (in bytes) equals to the logical record n.(RLn)<p>
field RL n : logical record n, of size (in bytes) described in field n.<p>
field 0 : 4 bytes of value 0, wich indicate the end of the records within the block.<p>
field p : null data, with no information, necessary to complete the size of the physical block, so that it is a multiple of 512 bytes.     <H5>     </H5>
<LI>End of file marks<p>
The end of file marks are mentionated (EOF) in the format manuals. Whenever 1/4" tapes are used for recording, the marks are kept in the same position described in the manuals.<H5>      </H5>
EXAMPLE :<p>
An example of a routine (FORTRAN type), wich returns a tape logical record every time it is called, is given below. The routine presumes that there is another one available for use, (called LE_BLOCO), wich alocates the next physical block in the tape in a vector called BLOCO; the size of the physical block (in bytes) in a variable called TAMANHO_FISICO, and the reading error code (or an EOF reading code or zero, if no reading error occurs) in a variable called STATUS.
</OL> 
<pre>
<H1>         </H1>
</pre>
<H4> SUBROUTINE LE_REGISTRO ( REGISTRO, TAMANHO_REGISTRO, STATUS )</H4>
<pre> 
C---------------------------------------------------------------------
C
C Purpose :
C
C  Read the 1/4" tapes distributed by INPE, containing 
C  image data.
C
C  Every time this routine is called it returns a tape record.
C  The records are described on the format manuals distributed
C  by INPE.
C
C Arguments :
C
C REGISTRO : Vector that contains a logical record.
C
C TAMANHO_REGISTRO : An integer (4 bytes), that contains 
C the size of the record to be transferred.
C    
C STATUS : An integer that returns the reading condition.
C Possible values are :
C
C  0 : reading error 
C -1 : end of file mark found
C other value : reading error code
C
C---------------------------------------------------------------------
C
C     Not every compiler allows the definition of
C     an unsigned variable.
C     In this case, remove the instruction that compute
C     the variable TAMANHO_REGISTRO and remove the
C     subsequent comment lines.
<H3>     </H3> 
      UNSIGNED BYTE REGISTRO (16*1024-4)<p>
      UNSIGNED BYTE BLOCO (16*1024)<H6>   </H6> 
      INTEGER*4 TAMANHO_REGISTRO<p>
      INTEGER*4 TAMANHO_FISICO<H6>    </H6> 
      INTEGER PONTEIRO
      INTEGER STATUS<p>
      INTEGER TR(4)<H6>    </H6> 
      LOGICAL BLOCO_DISPONIVEL /.FALSE./
<H3>     </H3> 
C     Not every compiler allows the maintainance of a variable
C     value between two subroutines call. In this case, the 
C     variables BLOCO, TAMANHO_FISICO, PONTEIRO and 
C     BLOCO_DISPONIVEL must be in "common".<p>

INPE's Amazonia Program (AMZ) was created in 1989 throught the Federal Decree
7797 of July 10, 1989.  The objective of the Program is to study the Amazon
problems using INPEs infraestruture and scientific expertise.<p>
<p>
Earth Observation Branch has an active participation in this Program,
particularly through its involvement in the EOS Project, The Institutional
Program has two more scientific areas of interest besides Remote Sensing:
Meteorology and Atmospheric Chemistry, Whose activities are carried out outside
the brach. The Meteorology component is of interest in the Program due to the
need to better evaluate different kinds of impacts on Amazonian ecosystems
caused by rainfall, droughts, floodings, etc.  The Atmospheric Chemistry Is
concerned with better understanding the effects of excess ozone concentrations
caused by biomass bumings, as well as the emission of other gases such as
carbon monoxide, or the major greenhouse as carbon dioxide.  It also includes
studies about the chemical composition and acidity of rainwater and rivers of
the region.<p>
<p>
Regarding the remote sensing component of the Institutional Amazonia Project,
its objectives are.<p>
<p>
(a)	to use remote sensing techniques, data integration, and modelling to study
the impact of the anthropic activities in Amazonia ecosystems, aiming at
understanding the role of Amazonia in the global change processes; (b) to study
the interaction between vegetation, soil, rocks, water, and climate to
subsidize the rational occupation and the sustainable exploitation of the
natural Amazonian resources (renewable and non-

renewable),
minimizing the environmental degradation.<p>

<b>HIST&Oacute;RICO</b>
<center>
<p>
	O Laborat&oacute;rio de Tratamento de Imagens Digitais do INPE teve sua origem
em 1974 quando foi adquirido o primeiro sistema de processamento de imagens
para o Deapartamento de Sensoriamento Remoto, o Image-100. Este equipamento era
constituido de um computador PDP11-45 com 256 Kbytes de mem&oacute;ria e 13
discos remov&iacute;veis de 80 Mbytes cada e o processador propriamente dito,
composto de 5 planos de imagens (mem&oacute;ria) de tamanho de 512 linhas por
512 pixels cada e ficava instalado em uma sala do pr&eacute;dio Beta. Em 1981
foi  construido um local para a instala&ccedil;&atilde;o deste  equipamento
anexo ao pr&eacute;dio do Sensoriamento Remoto, o qual tamb&eacute;m abrigava
todo o pessoal de desenvolvimento de software. <p>
<p>
	Com a vig&ecirc;ncia da lei de inform&aacute;tica, tornou-se imposs&iacute;vel
a atualiza&ccedil;&atilde;o desse equipamento, bem como a
importa&ccedil;&atilde;o de novos, obrigando o INPE a desenvolver seu
pr&oacute;prio sistema de processamento de imagens, o SITIM, sendo instalados
no LTID, 3 unidades desse equipamento, interligados por uma rede local de baixa
velocidade. <p>
<p>
	Com o final da lei de inform&aacute;tica em 1989, pode-se repensar a
configura&ccedil;&atilde;o do hardware do laborat&oacute;rio. O sistema
Image-100, j&aacute; totalmente obsoleto, foi desativado e um servidor de rede
foi adquirido da Sun Microsystems e mais 8 esta&ccedil;&otilde;es SITIM
vers&atilde;o 150. Todo esse equipamento foi interligado em rede Ethernet,
possibilitando a troca de dados entre a servidora e os sistemas de
processamento de imagens. Em 1991 mais 4 esta&ccedil;&otilde;es de trabalho
foram adquiridas, softwares para o sistema operacional Unix e todo o
laborat&oacute;rio foi interligado &agrave; rede Internet, possibilitando o
acesso a dados em todo o mundo.<p>

<b>O LTID NOS DIAS DE HOJE</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>	</b>Ap&oacute;s sucessivas atualiza&ccedil;&otilde;es de hardware e uma
grande expans&atilde;o da rede local, o LTID &eacute; sem d&uacute;vida um dos
laborat&oacute;rios mais bem equipados do hemisf&eacute;rio sul. Sua
configura&ccedil;&atilde;o atual &eacute; de uma servidora Sun sparc 1000 com
128 Mbytes de RAM, 2 CPU's, 20 Gbytes de disco, 3 saidas Ethernet
(subdivis&atilde;o da rede local em sub-redes), todos os tipos de leitoras de
fitas e cd rom. A rede local (dom&iacute;nio ltid.inpe.br) se espalha ao longo
dos pr&eacute;dios da &aacute;rea de Sensoriamento Remoto, conectando
v&aacute;rias esta&ccedil;&otilde;es de trabalho de diversos fabricantes, bem
como microcomputadores. <p>
	Ao longo de cada "tent&aacute;culo" dessa rede foram ainda definidas
sub-redes, com servidores escravos, com a finalidade de diminuir o
tr&aacute;fego pela servidora.<p>
	Quanto aos softwares instalados, pode-se citar:<p>
	- Arc Info : sistema de informa&ccedil;oes geogr&aacute;ficas<p>
	- PCI : sistema de processamento de imagens (inclui radar)<p>
	- Spring : sistema de processamento de imagens e informa&ccedil;&otilde;es
geogr&aacute;ficas<p>
	- ER Mapper : sistema de processamento de imagens<p>
	- SITIM - sistema de processamento de imagens em microcomputadores<p>
	- SGI : sistema de informa&ccedil;&otilde;es geogr&aacute;ficas em
microcomputadores<p>
	- Grads : sistema de processamento de imagens meteorol&oacute;gicas<p>
	- IDL : linguagem de programa&ccedil;&atilde;o para processamento de imagens<p>
	- Compiladores C, C++,Fortran,gcc e g++<p>
	- V&aacute;rios utilit&aacute;rios de dom&iacute;nio p&uacute;blico.<p>

<p>
<b>O LTID PARA O FUTURO</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	Dentre as previs&otilde;es j&aacute; consolidadas para o
laborat&oacute;rio, prev&ecirc;-se para meados do pr&oacute;ximo ano a
substitui&ccedil;&atilde;o da atual rede de 10 Mbits por uma rede de 100 Mbits
baseada em fibra &oacute;tica interligando as m&aacute;quinas principais e
concentradores Ethernet (HUB's) e subredes baseadas em par tran&ccedil;ado
(fast ethernet). Tamb&eacute;m j&aacute; est&aacute; aprovado a
atualiza&ccedil;&atilde;o das m&aacute;quinas mais antigas para Sun-Sparc-20,
ampliando a capacidade total instalada de disco no LTID para mais de 50
Gbytes.<p>
<p>
	&Eacute; filosofia do laborat&oacute;rio permitir aos pesquisadores e alunos
da p&oacute;s-gradua&ccedil;&atilde;o em Sensoriamento Remoto, o acesso ao
maior n&uacute;mero poss&iacute;vel de sistemas de processamento de imagens e
informa&ccedil;&otilde;es geogr&aacute;ficas, provendo interfaces
amig&aacute;veis entre m&aacute;quinas e usu&aacute;rios.<p>

<h4>December 16, 1996</h4>
<h2>Article 8.4.C and E</h2>
<h1>Penalty Overtime Exclusion Period </h1>
<p>In accordance with provisions of the National Agreement,
penalty overtime rates are not paid during the month of December.
It has been the practice to designate four consecutive work weeks
(which might include some days in November) as the December
penalty overtime exclusion period. For December 1996, the
American Postal Workers Union and the US Postal Service agreed
that the exclusion begins November 30, 1996 (start of week two of
pay period 25-96) and ends December 27, 1996 (end of week one of
pay period 01-97). </p>
<p>Note: The November 7, 1996 <em>Postal Bulletin</em> reported
the wrong dates. Management will make the necessary correction. </p>
<h1>Cost-of-Living Adjustments</h1>
<p><strong>The CPI-W rose in November to 464.2. After the fourth
month of the third cost-of-living adjustment period under the
1994 National Agreement, postal workers have accrued:</strong></p>
<p align="center">Per Annum: $ 239.20 </p>
<p align="center">Per Pay Period: $ 9.20 </p>
<p align="center">Cents Per Hour: 11.50&#162;</p>
<p>The next COLA will be effective March 1, 1997 and will be
reflected in checks dated March 21, 1997 (PP 06-97). </p>
<p>Employees are receiving $520 per annum as a result of the
first two COLA increases.</p>
<p><strong>CSRS COLA </strong></p>
<p>The 1997 CSRS retiree COLA is based on the third quarter
(July, August, September) average CPI-W index in 1996 over the
1995 third quarter average. The 1997 CSRS cost-of-living
adjustment will be 2.9% and will be reflected in January 1997
annuity checks. </p>
<p>The 1995 CSRS COLA was 2.8%. The 1996 CSRS COLA was 2.6% and
reflected in April, 1996 annuity checks. </p>
<p><strong>FERS COLA </strong></p>
<p>The 1997 FERS retiree COLA is based on the third quarter
(July, August, September) average CPI-W index in 1996 over the
1995 third quarter average. However, if the CPI-W quarterly
average increases 3% or more, one percentage point is subtracted.
A 5% increase in the quarterly CPI-W average results in a 4%
adjustment. If the quarterly average increases from 2% to 3%,
benefits will increase by 2%. If the CPI-W quarterly average
increases 2% or less, benefits will increase by the CPI-W
quarterly average increase. The 1997 FERS cost-of-living
adjustment will be 2.0% and will be reflected in January 1997
annuity checks. </p>
<p>The 1995 FERS COLA was 2.0%. The 1996 FERS COLA was 2.0% and
reflected in April, 1996 annuity checks. </p>
<p><strong>Social Security </strong></p>
<p>The 1997 Social Security COLA is based on the third quarter
(July, August, September) average CPI-W index in 1996 over the
1995 third quarter average. The 1997 SSI cost-of-living
adjustment will be 2.9% and will be reflected in January 1997
annuity checks. </p>
<p>The 1995 Social Security COLA was 2.8%. The 1996 Social
Security COLA was 2.6%. </p>
<p><strong>FECA COLA </strong></p>
<p>COLA increases for FECA recipients are based on the percentage
increase in the December index from year to year. After the
eleventh month of the 1997 adjustment period the CPI-W index has
risen 3.3%. </p>
<p>The 1995 FECA COLA was 2.7%. The 1996 FECA COLA was 2.5% and
reflected in March, 1996 benefit checks. </p>
<h3><strong>Cost-of-Living Adjustments for Data Centers </strong></h3>
<p>The CPI-W rose in November to 464.2. After the second month of
the third cost-of-living adjustment period under the 1995 Data
Centers Agreement, postal workers have accrued: </p>
<p align="center">Per Annum: $ 119.40 </p>
<p align="center">Per Pay Period: $ 4.60 </p>
<p align="center">Cents Per Hour: 5.75&#162;</p>

<h1><strong>About APWU</strong> </h1>
<p>The American Postal Workers Union, AFL-CIO, represents 366,000
employees of the U.S. Postal Service who are clerks, maintenance
employees, motor vehicle operators, special delivery messengers,
and non-mail processing professional employees. The world's
largest postal union, APWU is also the fifteenth largest union in
the AFL-CIO. </p>
<h1><img src="images/line_vtb.gif" align="bottom" width="500"
height="6"></h1>
<h1>History</h1>
<p>Postal unions, dating back to the nineteenth century, have
gone through a number of transitions paralleling the growth of
the former Post Office Department and its transformation into the
U.S. Postal Service under the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970.
Under the PRA, postal unions first won the right to bargain
collectively over wages, hours and working conditions. </p>
<p>APWU was founded on July 1, 1971, the result of a merger of
five postal unions: the United Federation of Postal Clerks, the
National Postal Union, the National Association of Post Office
and General Service Maintenance Employees, the National
Federation of Motor Vehicle Employees and the National
Association of Special Delivery Messengers.</p>
<p><img src="images/line_vtb.gif" align="bottom" width="500"
height="6"></p>
<h1>Structure</h1>
<p>APWU's top officers are the president, Moe Biller; the
executive vice president, William Burrus; and the
secretary-treasurer, Douglas Holbrook.</p>
<p>The union's organizational structure reflects its separate
craft origins. There are five craft divisions: clerk,
maintenance, motor vehicle, special delivery and mail handler,
and a support services department. Other headquarters departments
are industrial relations, legislative, research and education,
organization, and human relations. Craft divisons and departments
are each headed by a director.</p>
<p>The three top officers, the directors of the departments and
divisions, other craft division and department officers, five
regional coordinators and 60 national business agents are all
elected by mail ballot referendum of the membership every three
years. The next election of officers will be in 1998.</p>
<p>The APWU has more than 2000 locals located in every state and
territory of the United States. Its top governing body is the
biennial national convention, the next to be held in August,
1998. Between conventions, a 13-person national executive board
sets union policy. Members of the NEB are the top three officers,
the five craft division directors, the director of industrial
relations and the five regional coordinators.</p>

<h1>QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THE APWU</h1>
<h3>1. What is the APWU?</h3>
<p>The APWU -- American Postal Workers Union -- is a national
organization of employees of the US Postal Service dedicated to
advancing the interests of its members and their families.
Representing 362,000 postal employees in every state and
territory in the United States, the APWU is the largest union of
postal workers in the world. It is recognized as the collective
bargaining agent for USPS employees in the clerk, motor vehicle
service, maintenance and special delivery messenger crafts. In
addition, the APWU represents workers employed in support
services: Materiel Distribution Centers, Information Service
Centers, Mail Equipment Shops, and Operating Services Facilities.
Many workers in the mail handler craft also belong to the APWU.</p>
<h3>2. What does the union do?</h3>
<p>The primary job of the union is to negotiate a National
Agreement with the US Postal Service. This is a contract which
establishes wages, working conditions and other benefits for all
workers under its jurisdiction. The union also protects workers'
rights by representing them with regard to day-to-day problems on
the job such as discipline, violations of seniority, harassment,
discrimination, or other management abuse. Additionally, the APWU
addresses other workplace concerns such as safety and health and
the impact of technological change.</p>
<h3>3. What are the benefits of belonging?</h3>
<p>Membership in the APWU gives you a voice in determining your
future. Members have the right to participate in local meetings,
to vote for local and national officers, to vote on the contract,
to run for office and to petition for change in the union. </p>
<p>Other membership benefits include: <em><strong>The American
Postal Worker</strong></em>, plain monthly newspaper about issues
and programs affecting postal workers.</p>
<p>A safety and health program which educates workers about
workplace hazards and provides technical assistance. Plus,
eligibility for: The plain APWU Health Plan, which provides
comprehensive coverage at a very reasonable cost. Benefits
through the Voluntary Benefits Plan, including: APWU MasterCard;
Group Legal Services; Term Life Insurance; Short- and Long-term
Disability Plans; Supplemental Hospital Cash; Accidental Death
&amp; Dismemberment; Basic Care Hospital Plan; and the APWU Home
Mortgage Program. Scholarships -- college and vocational
scholarships awarded to outstanding children of APWU members.</p>
<h3>4.Who can join?</h3>
<p>APWU membership is open to any employee of the USPS regardless
of race, color, creed, sex, sexual orientation, nationality,
handicap, political affiliation, age or religion. Those in
supervisory or management positions can join only to receive
APWU's Health Plan.</p>
<h3>5. Who runs the union?</h3>
<p>You, the members do. Every level of the APWU operates
democratically on the principle of majority rule. Members have a
free voice and vote to express their views in the union. All
local, regional, and national officers are elected by the
members, as are the officers and business agents in each craft
division. Members also ratify the National Agreement and elect
delegates to the National Convention.</p>
<p>The convention, which convenes every two years, is the highest
governing body in the union. Between conventions, the National
Executive Board directs union policy and programs.</p>
<h3>6. How is APWU structured?</h3>
<p>APWU operates on several levels. </p>
<p>Most members belong to a local union with jurisdiction in
their city, town or area. Locals elect their own officers and
conduct their own day-to-day business. They may establish local
dues and may negotiate a local contract to supplement the
National Agreement on certain local concerns.</p>
<p>Nationally, the APWU maintains a headquarters in Washington,
DC to administer the union and to implement programs and policies
mandated by the convention and the National Executive Board. The
national resident officers include the president, the executive
vice president, the secretary-treasurer, the national division
officers, and department directors and officers, all of whom work
under the general supervision of the president.</p>
<p>We have a separate division for each craft -- Clerk,
Maintenance, Motor Vehicle Service, Special Delivery Messenger,
Support Services, and Mail Handler -- concerned with the special
problems of the workers in the craft. In addition to national
officers, each division, except the Mail Handler Division, has
representatives in the field called national business agents. For
the Mail Handler Division, the APWU Constitution calls for the
apppointment of five regional mail handler representatives, to be
utilized on an as-needed basis.</p>
<p>We also have departments responsible for handling specific
administrative functions and providing special services to the
membership -- Legislative, Industrial Relations, Organization,
Research and Education, Human Relations, and Health Plan.</p>
<p>Regional coordinators maintain an office in each of five
regions: Central, Eastern, Northeast, Southern, and Western.</p>
<h3>7. How are officers elected?</h3>
<p>National union officers are elected by mail ballot of the
membership every three years. The officers and national business
agents for each craft division are elected by the members in that
division. Additionally, regional coordinators are elected by the
members in each region. Any member may become a candidate for
national office by filing a petition in accordance with the
requirements spelled out in the APWU Constitution.</p>
<h3>8. How much are dues?</h3>
<p>Dues are very reasonable and vary from local to local. They
include national dues established by the National Convention and
local dues determined by your local union.</p>
<p>After you've joined APWU by completing Form 1187, dues are
automatically deducted from your pay check. Your steward or local
officer can tell you the cost of dues; or, if you are a member,
you can check your pay stub.</p>
<h3>9. How are my dues spent?</h3>
<p>National dues pay for all the operating expenses of the union,
including contract negotiations, grievance handling above the
local level, and the cost for arbitration at the regional and
national levels. Members' dues also cover the cost of
publications, legal fees, legislative activities, education and
training, and community service programs.</p>
<h3>10. How does the union negotiate the National Agreement?</h3>
<p>The APWU has a National Negotiating Team composed of the
president, the executive vice president, the director of
Industrial Relations, and the directors of the crafts we
represent. This team meets with Postal Service management several
months before a current contract expires. The team proposes
contract language, the Postal Service responds, and through the
give and take of negotiation they try to reach agreement.</p>
<h3>11. Do I get to vote on the contract?</h3>
<p>Yes. A negotiated National Agreement becomes valid only on
approval by the membership through a mail ballot. After the
National Negotiating Team reaches agreement with the Postal
Service, a Rank and File Bargaining Advisory Committee reviews
the proposed contract. If they approve it, the contract is sent
to the entire APWU membership for ratification. If the committee
is not satisfied, it can return the contract to the National
Negotiating Team to reopen negotiations.</p>
<h3>12. What about strikes?</h3>
<p>The APWU believes that the right to strike is an inalienable
right of all American workers. However, federal law prohibits
strikes by postal and federal employees and requires that if
contract negotiations do not result in agreement, unresolved
disputes are to be submitted to arbitration -- to an impartial
third party -- for resolution.</p>
<p>While our position is 'no contract, no work,' the 1982 APWU
National Convention authorized our national leadership to
continue negotiations past the contract deadline if they feel
this is necessary to reach agreement, as long as postal workers
continue to be covered under the previous contract. Thus, the
APWU views the strike as a weapon of last resort to be used only
when all other means of reaching agreement have been exhausted. </p>
<h3>13. Suppose I have a grievance?</h3>
<p>If you have a grievance -- you believe that management has
violated your rights or subjected you to harassment or
discrimination -- you should immediately talk to your steward
about the problem. The steward, who is your union representative
on the work floor, will determine whether a violation has
occurred and will try to reach a settlement with your immediate
supervisor. If this effort fails, the union can appeal
management's action to a higher level. If all these efforts fail
to result in a satisfactory solution, the union may request that
an impartial arbitrator be called in to settle the grievance. </p>
<h3>14. What about job security?</h3>
<p>As spelled out in our National Agreement, all career postal
workers have a lifetime guarantee of job security after six years
of service.</p>
<h3>15. How is APWU fighting privatization?</h3>
<p>Privatization is the Postal Service's attempt to contract out
postal work -- <strong>your work</strong> -- to private companies
that hire low-wage, nonunion workers. The APWU has been
successfully fighting efforts to privatize postal services for
years. The APWU monitors all management attempts to contract out
work that belongs to our bargaining unit and makes sure that the
National Agreement is upheld.</p>
<p>In May 1993, APWU won an important privatization dispute at
the national level when an arbitrator ruled that Remote Bar Code
Sorting (RBCS) work should have been offered to bargaining-unit
workers. The Postal Service had contracted the work out to
several companies that hired nonunion workers at sub-postal
wages. As a result of subsequent negotiations between the APWU
and the USPS, Remote Encoding Centers are now staffed by
APWU-represented postal employees.</p>
<h3>16. Is the APWU affiliated with other organizations?</h3>
<p>Yes. The APWU is affiliated with the American Federation of
Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), a
federation of 78 national unions with a combined membership of 13
million workers. APWU also belongs to the AFL-CIO's Public
Employee Department and Industrial Union Department.</p>
<p>The APWU also is affiliated with the Postal, Telegraph and
Telephone International (PTTI), an organization of labor unions
representing workers in the field of communications in nations
throughout the world.</p>
<h3>17. Is the APWU involved in legislation and politics?</h3>
<p>Because legislation has an important impact on our members,
the union is definitely involved in legislative matters. The APWU
maintains a very effective legislative program which monitors
legislation being considered by Congress that will have an impact
on postal workers and their families. APWU COPA -- the Committee
On Political Action -- raises voluntary contributions to assist
the campaigns of friendly legislators and to defeat those who
consistently oppose us. COPA also has a <em><strong>Voices in
Politics</strong></em> (VIP) publication which advises postal
workers and their families on legal grassroots political action.</p>
<h3>18. How can I find out what's going on in the union?</h3>
<p>You can stay informed by going to union meetings and
participating in the activities of your local. Remember that as a
member you have an equal voice and vote with all other members.
Your steward and local officers can answer questions you may have
about specific union programs and policies. Additionally, reading
local and national union publications such as <em><strong>The
American Postal Worker</strong></em> monthly newspaper and the
APWU <em><strong>News Service</strong></em> bulletin will keep
you informed about your union.</p>
<h3>19. I'm not a member yet. How do I join?</h3>
<p>Ask your steward or a local officer for a Form 1187 and fill
it out. Part must be completed by you, and part by the local.
Your union dues will automatically be deducted from your pay
check. You can get more information from your steward or other
union officer. If you work in a very small office where you have
difficulty getting information, contact Frank A. Romero, Director
of Organization, at APWU headquarters, 1300 L Street, NW,
Washington, DC 20005, 202-842-4227.</p>
<h3>20. I'm already a member. What can I do to help the union?</h3>
<p>It's important to keep in mind that <em>you</em> are the
union; members are the lifeblood of the APWU. The best way to
improve the union is to get involved. In addition to attending
union meetings, consider joining a committee, working to organize
nonmembers, becoming a steward, and volunteering to help in union
activities. Your union brothers and sisters will appreciate your
participation.</p>
<h3>21. <strong>WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?</strong></h3>

    <h1 align="center"><img src="images/cnbcpic.gif"
    align="bottom" width="550" height="301"></h1>
    <p>APWU President Moe Biller appeared on nationwide
    television on Wednesday, December 4, 1996 to lodge the
    union's objections to a report issued earlier in the day
    calling for a radical downward adjustment of the government's
    leading measure of inflation--the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
    The so-called &quot;Boskin Commission&quot; report, named
    after a panel of five economists appointed by the Senate
    Finance Committee and chaired by Bush administration
    economist Michael Boskin, claimed that the government's
    inflation index has been overstated by approximately 1.1
    percentage points and should be adjusted accordingly. The
    result would be increased tax payments for all working
    Americans and reduced cost-of-living adjustments for postal
    workers, postal/federal annuitants, people on Social Security
    and families receiving food stamps. </p>
    <p><strong>&quot;I think that it appears to me to be a
    political ploy with cover by economists who are selected on a
    biased basis,&quot; Biller said. &quot;The entire thing is a
    political ploy to reduce benefits to a quarter of the
    American population--43 million Social Security recipients, 3
    million federal and postal annuitants and 6 million people on
    food stamps--and that's a disgrace. I think the politicians
    involved ought to be ashamed of themselves....It's a
    bipartisan effort to shaft the people.&quot; </strong></p>
    <p>In the photo above, Biller is shown speaking from
    Washington with CNBC's Terry Keenan in the network studios
    outside of New York City. Biller appeared on CNBC's
    &quot;Market Wrap&quot; report, which airs worldwide at the
    close of the stock market each weekday. See the January issue
    of The American Postal Worker for more on the Boskin
    Commission report and APWU's response. </p>

<h1 align="center">Open Season Continued</h1>
<h1 align="center">For APWU Health Plan!</h1>
<p><strong>USPS personnel offices have been authorized to accept
belated enrollment in the APWU Health Plan through the close of
business on Friday, December 20, 1996. This is due to failure by
the company contracted to distribute the 1997 FEHB (Federal
Employees Health Benefits) Guide to meet the mailing deadlines
and to fulfill other requirements. </strong></p>
<p>FEHB Open Season elections will be accepted, without question,
until December 20. After December 20, an employee may still
request a belated election, but the personnel office will not
automatically accept the election without determining whether the
inability to register was due to circumstances beyond the
employee's control. </p>
<p><b>How to Enroll in the APWU Health Plan</b> </p>
<p>Open Season elections are effective January 4, 1997. To join
the APWU Health Plan, go to your personnel office or postmaster
and request a Health Benefits Registration Form (Standard Form
2809). On the form, indicate <b>Code 471</b> for Self Only
coverage or <b>Code 472</b> for Self and Family enrollment. For
1997, active postal employees pay only <b>$10.70</b> biweekly for
Self Only coverage, just <b>$25.21</b> biweekly for Self and
Family. </p>
<p><b>Check Out the Health Plan&#146;s Great Benefits</b> </p>
<p>For details on the many benefits offered by the APWU Health
Plan, please refer to the October and November issues of The
American Postal Worker or the October 3 News Service bulletin. Or
call the plan's Open Season hotline at <b>1-800-PIC-APWU

<h1 align="center">Locals Notified of Potential 'Sharps' Hazard </h1>
<p><strong>On November 21, 1996, APWU national headquarters
notified all local presidents, regional coordinators and NBAs of
a potential serious safety and health problem. The
Becton-Dickinson Company recently offered a rebate to customers
who mail back to the company their used syringes and needles.
Some of these customers have been sending improperly packaged
syringes and needles to the company, located in Young America,
MN. If not handled appropriately, these improperly packaged
medical devices may injure employees and expose them to blood
infected with, for example, the hepatitis virus. </strong></p>
<p>Although the company is making attempts to contact its
customers to instruct them not to mail syringes, some of these
improperly packaged medical sharps may already be in the
mailstream. </p>
<p>Local unions were advised by national headquarters to inform
workers and to meet with local management to encourage them to
make all employees, especially window clerks, aware of the
potential problem. Also, USPS headquarters has instructed local
managers to update their bloodborne disease exposure response
plan, reissue the post-incident protocol, and establish
preventive procedures from acceptance to delivery. </p>
<p>APWU headquarters also sent locals a copy of a letter from
USPS headquarters alerting the union to the potential hazard, and
a copy of Management Instruction EL-810-92-4, Bloodborne Disease
Exposure Control Plans. The Management Instruction details the
procedures to prevent exposure to blood and infectious materials,
as well as the steps to take if an employee is exposed. Locals
were advised to review this policy and determine if local
management is abiding by its requirements. </p>

    <h1 align="center">The APWU Health Plan-- A Great Deal for
    Union Members </h1>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Members of the APWU get a great deal when they take
advantage of the APWU Health Plan's outstanding benefits and low
premiums. This Open Season, </strong><font color="#008000"><strong><blink>November
11-December 9</blink></strong></font><strong>, every union member
should take a look at the excellent health care value offered by
the APWU Health Plan. </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Protection and Peace of Mind </strong></p>
<p>For 1997, active postal employees pay only $10.70 biweekly for
Self Only coverage, just <strong>$25.21</strong> biweekly for
Self and Family. These low premiums assure you of protection and
peace of mind for your health care needs--comprehensive benefits,
including many services covered at 100 percent, and convenient
flexibility. </p>
<p>Members save money by using the plan's Preferred Provider
Organization--including over 200,000 primary care physicians,
specialists, surgeons, outpatient medical facilities,
chiropractors, mental conditions specialists and laboratories;
and nearly 3,000 hospitals. Members are also covered when they
choose any hospital or health care provider they wish. </p>
<p>The plan offers comprehensive prescription drug coverage as
well, with a network of 53,000 pharmacies and a mail order
program that will save you money. </p>
<p>Members of the APWU Health Plan can also take advantage of the
very popular Nurse Advisory Line--a voluntary service that gives
you a medical practitioner as close as the telephone 24 hours a
day. </p>
<p>There is much, much more offered by the APWU Health Plan. Be
sure to check it out in detail in the October and November issues
of <em>The American Postal Worker</em> or the October 3 <em>News
Service</em> bulletin. Or call the plan's Open Season hotline at <strong>1-800-PIC-APWU
(742-2798)</strong>; TDD/deaf, <strong>1-800-622-2511</strong>.

<h1 align="center">$187.20 Banked Toward Next COLA </h1>
<p><strong>After the third month of the third cost-of-living
adjustment period under the 1994-1998 Collective Bargaining
Agreement, postal workers have accumulated a cost-of-living
adjustment of 9 cents per hour, $7.20 per pay period or $187.20
annually. This results from an increase in the CPI-W to 463.2 in
October. </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>CSRS and FERS </strong></p>
<p>CSRS retiree COLA is based on the third quarter (July, August,
September) average CPI-W index in 1996 over the 1995 third
quarter average. The 1997 CSRS cost-of-living adjustment will be
2.9 percent and will be reflected in January 1997 annuity checks. </p>
<p>The formula for FERS retirees is the same as for CSRS
retirees, except that if the CPI-W average increases 3 percent or
more, the adjustment will be the CPI-W increase minus 1 percent.
If the CPI-W average increases between 2 and 3 percent, then the
adjustment will be 2 percent. The 1997 FERS cost-of-living
adjustment will be 2 percent and will be reflected in January
1997 annuity checks. </p>
<p align="center"><strong>FECA COLA </strong></p>
<p>COLA increases for FECA recipients are based on the percentage
increase in the December index from year to year. After the tenth
month of the 1996 adjustment period, the CPI-W has increased 3
percent over the December 1995 base index. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/ot.jpg" align="bottom"

<h1 align="center">Penalty Overtime Exclusion Period</h1>
<p><strong>In accordance with provisions of the National
Agreement, penalty overtime rates are not paid during the month
of December. It has been the practice to designate four
consecutive work weeks (which might include some days in
November) as the December penalty overtime exclusion period. For
December 1996, the American Postal Workers Union and the US
Postal Service agreed that the exclusion begins November 30, 1996
(start of week two of pay period 25-96) and ends December 27,
1996 (end of week one of pay period 01-97). </strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The November 7, 1996 <em>Postal
Bulletin</em> reported the wrong dates. Management will make the
necessary correction. </p>

<h1 align="center">$400 Lump Sum</h1>
<p><strong>APWU members are reminded that the $400 lump sum
payment due on December 13 will be included in regular pay checks
However, tax withholding will be calculated separately at the
average tax rate for each employee for 1996. For more
information, refer to the November 8 issue of the </strong><em><strong>News

<p><strong>January 3, 1997 marks the end of the leave year for
1996. The 1994-1998 contract allows workers to carry over up to
440 hours of accumulated annual leave into the next year. Note
that any annual leave exceeding the 440-hour limit must be used
by January 3, 1997.</strong></p>

<h1 align="center"><strong>Acclaimed Drama, '</strong><em><strong>The
Killing Floor</strong></em><strong>'</strong></h1>
<h1 align="center"><strong>Available on Video </strong></h1>
<p><strong>Videocassettes of the Sundance award-winning, widely
acclaimed labor film, </strong><em><strong>The Killing Floor</strong></em><strong>,
are now available directly from Made in USA Productions, the
non-profit company which produced the film. </strong></p>
<p>This compelling dramatic feature film (1985, 118 minutes,
color) tells the timeless, true story of the courageous drive to
build an interracial labor union in the Chicago Stockyards in the
face of the brutal efforts by management to divide the workforce
during the 1919 race riots. <em>The Killing Floor</em> is an Elsa
Rassbach Production directed, by Bill Duke, and stars Damien
Leake, Alfre Woodard, Clarence Felder, Dennis Farina and Moses
Gunn. The research effort was led by scholars David Brody and
William Tuttle. </p>
<p>Shown on PBS in the 1980s, this union-made production was
supported by more than 30 unions and the AFL-CIO, as well as
federal and foundation grants. Reviewers have often called <em>The
Killing Floor</em> &quot;brilliant.&quot; <em>The Village Voice</em>
wrote that it's the most &quot;clear-eyed account of union
organizing on film.&quot; </p>
<p>This classic film has long been unavailable but
life-of-cassette leases are now available to labor and community
groups at prices ranging from $89.95 for one cassette to $49.95
each for 100 or more cassettes, plus shipping and handling. 16mm
film rentals are also available. Made in USA Productions will use
all proceeds for new labor film projects. For information or to

<h1 align="center">Your APWU Health Plan--</h1>
<h1 align="center">Protection and Peace of Mind </h1>
<p><strong>This Open Season the APWU Health Plan again offers
great benefits, protection and peace of mind--all at a
hard-to-beat premium. Not only will APWU Health Plan members have
the protection of an excellent, comprehensive benefits package,
they'll also get peace of mind, knowing that the Health Plan will
be there for them when they need it. </strong></p>
<p>For 1997, active postal employees pay only <strong>$10.70 </strong>biweekly
for Self Only coverage, just <strong>$25.21</strong> biweekly for
Self and Family. With the benefits and flexibility you get for
these premiums, it's clear the plan is a great value for APWU
members. </p>
<p><strong>Many Services Paid At 100 Percent! </strong></p>
<p>With the APWU Health Plan, you get important services such as <strong>Emergency
First Aid</strong> treatment for accidental injury, <strong>Well
Child care, generic prescriptions</strong> purchased through the
Mail Order program, and more, <strong>paid at 100 percent with no
deductible. </strong></p>
<p>Other services, such as office visits to Preferred Providers
and Preferred Chiropractors, have no deductible and are paid at
100 percent after a $10 copayment. </p>
<p>Of course, the Plan will continue to offer its popular
toll-free voluntary <strong>Nurse Advisory Line</strong>--members
have a medical practitioner as close as the telephone, 24 hours a
day! Also, new members of the Health Plan will receive an
award-winning medical guide book. </p>
<p>In addition to strong medical/surgical/hospitalization
coverage, the Plan continues to feature some of the most
comprehensive prescription drug benefits in the Federal Employees
Health Benefits (FEHB) Program. With the mail order program,
there's no deductible to pay, and generic drugs are paid at 100
percent; brand-name drugs are covered at 85 percent of the
discounted price. For immediate-care prescriptions, you'll get
discounts at more than <strong>52,000</strong> retail pharmacies.
There's a $50 deductible, then you only pay 20 percent of the
discounted price. With either program, you never file a claim! </p>
<p><strong>Huge Preferred Provider Network Still Growing </strong></p>
<p>The Health Plan offers its members 3,000 hospitals and 200,000
outpatient care providers where they can get excellent medical
care with less out-of-pocket expenses. The plan's Preferred
Provider Organization (PPO) network cover all 50 states, as well
as Washington, DC and Puerto Rico. </p>
<p>At PPO hospitals, the APWU Health plan will pay 100 percent
for room and board charges and 95 percent for all other inpatient
hospital based charges. The network's 200,000 outpatient care
providers include primary care physicians, specialists, surgeons,
outpatient medical facilities, chiropractors, mental conditions
specialists and laboratories. </p>
<p>You'll always get a great deal by choosing to use these PPO
providers--but, as always, <strong>APWU members are free to
choose any hospital or health care provider they wish. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Call for More Information </strong></p>

<h1 align="center">Michigan State Convention Raises</h1>
<h1 align="center">$4,100 for APWU COPA </h1>
<p><strong>APWU members attending the Michigan State Convention
combined their political fundraising efforts to contribute $4,100
to the APWU COPA--Committee On Political Action--war chest.
Members of the San Francisco, CA Local also understand the
importance of raising money for political action. In the weeks
leading up to Election Day, local members organized several
fundraising activities that raised $3,614.48 for COPA. </strong></p>
<p>Although the November 5 elections are over, the struggle to
protect the future of American workers and their families
continues. APWU and auxiliary members should not abandon
political action! Despite President Bill Clinton's re-election,
Republicans have reclaimed victory in both the House and the
Senate. Judging from the vicious attacks working people faced
over the past two years, APWU and all of labor will have a rough
road ahead. </p>
<p>Legislation on Capitol Hill can have a tremendous impact on
postal/federal workers and retirees. But with every member's COPA
contribution, it will help APWU back supporters in Congress who
pledge to vote for postal workers' interests and help defeat
those who aim to cut back jobs, wages, hard-earned benefits, and
eliminate workers' rights to collective bargaining and a safe
workplace. Make an investment to protect the future! It's never
too late to give to COPA! </p>

Service</em> contributions list: </p>

<h1 align="center">Eligible Workers to Get </h1>
<h1 align="center">Lump-sum on December 13, 1996 </h1>
<p><strong>APWU-represented career and non-probationary employees
are scheduled to receive a $400 lump-sum payment consistent with
the terms of the 1994 National Agreement. (Transitional employees
and Support Services employees not included in the master
agreement are excluded.) Employees will receive payment on
December 13, 1996, incorporated into their regular pay checks.
Efforts to have the payment made prior to Christmas in a separate
check were unsuccessful; while it may have been possible to make
payment by separate check after Christmas, it was anticipated
that employees would prefer to have access to the monies for the
holiday season. </strong></p>
<p>Executive Vice President Bill Burrus has concluded discussions
with the Postal Service and following are the agreed-to
conditions of payment. </p>
<p>Eligibility: Those non-probationary, career employees on the
rolls in an APWU craft (Schedules C &amp; P) on November 21, 1996
will be eligible for payment if they were in a pay status anytime
from November 11, 1995 through November 8, 1996, unless in an
AWOL status or serving a suspension/discharge for the entire pay
period from October 25, 1996 through November 8. Employees who
are not on the (APWU craft) USPS rolls on November 21, 1996 will
not be eligible for payment under the APWU contract. There will
not be separate payments for eligible employees who were not in a
pay status during the pay period immediately preceding the
effective date (October 25 through November 8) but were in a pay
status during the preceding year. All eligible employees will
receive payment on the same date. </p>
<p>All eligible full-time employees will receive $400. Hourly
rate employees will receive a percentage of that based upon the
number of hours worked in the preceding year, as follows: </p>
<p>1 and under 500 hours -------- $100 </p>
<p>500 and under 1000 hours ----- $200 </p>
<p>1000 and under 1500 hours ---- $300 </p>
<p>1500 hours and over ---------------- $400 </p>
<p>The lump-sum payment will be included in the amount paid in
the December 13, 1996 check covering the period of November 23,
1996 through December 6, 1996. Deductions will include federal,
state and local taxes at the rate deducted for each employee,
Social Security and Medicare taxes. (Employees who have earned
the maximum $62,700 subject to Social Security deductions by
December 6, 1996 will not have Social Security deducted.) The tax
rate for the lump sum will be the average tax rate for each
employee for the year 1996; and even though the lump sum will be
combined with the regular check, the tax rate for the lump sum
may differ from that for hours worked. Retirement, health
benefits and union dues will not be deducted from the amount
included in the lump-sum payment. </p>
<p>Employees who left the covered APWU bargaining unit (Schedules
C &amp; P) prior to November 21, 1996 will not receive payment
under the APWU lump-sum payment procedures. Those APWU employees
who transferred to the Letter Carrier or Mail Handler crafts
prior to November 21, 1996 and were on the rolls of those crafts
on the eligibility date for payment will be eligible under the
lump sum payment procedures of their respective negotiated
agreements. APWU bargaining-unit employees who transferred to
non-bargaining-unit positions prior to November 21, 1996 will not
receive payment, as non-bargaining-unit employees are not
scheduled for a lump-sum payment based on the period covered.
Former letter carriers who transferred to an APWU craft prior to
November 21, 1996 will receive payment under the APWU payment
procedures, with credit for hours worked as a letter carrier. </p>
<p>Transferees from the Mail Handler craft to an APWU craft who
transferred prior to November 21, 1996 will receive payment under
the APWU payment procedures, but the allocation of hours worked
in the Mail Handler craft during the previous year has not been
resolved. Discussions are continuing for former mail handlers who
have not been paid under the APWU or Mail Handlers 1995 lump-sum
payment and who will not meet the eligibility requirements for
full 1996 payment. Further information regarding these
discussions will be provided. Inquiries should not be made
regarding eligibility for former mail handlers as Executive Vice
President Burrus is currently negotiating the resolution of this
issue, and no further information will be available until these
negotiations are concluded. </p>
<p>Employees who are on the OWCP rolls on November 21, 1996 or
who have not received pay from the USPS anytime from November 11,
1995 to November 8, 1996 will not be eligible for payment and
will not receive a check. Note: Employees who are on continuation
of pay, or whose conversion to OWCP rolls has been delayed, and
who appear on the USPS rolls on November 21, 1996 will be
eligible for payment if they meet the other criteria. </p>
<p>Former letter carriers who transferred to an APWU craft prior
to November 21, 1996 will receive the lump-sum payment on
December 13 consistent with the payment amounts afforded
full-time and hourly-rate employees. Hourly-rate transferees who
worked hours in the Letter Carrier craft from November 11, 1995
through November 8, 1996 shall have their hours computed to
include time spent in the Letter Carrier and APWU crafts to
determine the amount received. </p>
<p>Eligible employees who do not receive payment on December 13,
1996 should forward to the local union president a copy of their
December 13, 1996 pay stub with time records indicating that they
were on the rolls on November 21, 1996 and were in a pay status
anytime from November 11, 1995 to November 8, 1996. The local
president should review with the local payroll section the error
of non-payment, and, if the issue is unresolved, forward the
records to: </p>

<p align="center">Lump-sum Payment </p>
<p align="center">1300 L Street, NW </p>
<p align="center">Washington, DC 20005 </p>
<h3><strong>Grievances should not be initiated over payment or
non-payment of the lump sum. </strong></h3>
<p><strong>Reminder:</strong> Although the lump-sum payment will
be included in regular pay checks, the payment will not be taxed
at a rate as if compounded with regular pay. The tax rate for the
lump sum will be the average tax rate for each employee for the
year 1996. </p>

<h1 align="center">Flexible Spending Account Open Season </h1>
<p><strong>Postal workers have a great opportunity to save money
during Flexible Spending Account (FSA) open season, November
11-December 9, 1996. Money set aside in FSA accounts is not
subject to federal, Medicare, Social Security, or (in most
states) state taxes. Postal workers can save on out-of-pocket
medical, dental and child/dependent care expenses by paying with
these tax-free dollars. </strong></p>
<p>Following is a brief description of the FSA program. For
complete information, eligibility requirements and restrictions,
see your personnel department or postmaster. </p>
<p><strong>Health Care FSA </strong></p>
<p>For a Health Care FSA, workers estimate their expected
out-of-pocket medical expenses (for example, copayments,
deductibles and medical expenses not covered by your health
insurance) and commit that amount to the FSA in equal
installments each pay period. The minimum is $5 per pay period
($130/year); the maximum is $100 per pay period ($2,600/year). Be
advised that any funds remaining in the account at the end of the
year must be forfeited. </p>
<p><strong>Dependent Care FSA </strong></p>
<p>Postal workers can contribute a minimum of $130 a year, up to
a maximum of either $5,000 or $2,500 per year, to a Dependent
Care Flexible Spending Account, depending on their marital
tax-filing status and their spouse's earnings. These funds can be
used for nursery school, kindergarten, child care centers, summer
day camps, babysitters, dependent care centers and household
services related to dependent care. Covered dependents include
children under 13, children physically or mentally unable to care
for themselves, or relatives or household members physically or
mentally incapable of self care (if you claim them on your tax
return and they spend eight hours or more each day in your home).</p>
<p>If you have expenses such as these, don't miss this great
money-saving opportunity. Enroll in a Health Care or Dependent
Care FSA as soon as possible. </p>
<p>Participating employees must enroll in the FSAs each year. For
complete information, see your personnel department or
postmaster. </p>

<h1 align="center">'Not in Our Town II' Airs on PBS December 23 </h1>
<p><strong>When victims of violence are targeted because of their
race, religion or sexual orientation, fear spreads throughout the
community. Instead of allowing citizens to be terrorized, many
people respond in positive ways. &quot;Not in Our Town II&quot;
profiles communities across the country that have come together
to fight intolerance. The one-hour documentary airs on PBS
Monday, December 23 at 10:00 pm ET (check local listings). </strong></p>
<p>&quot;Not in Our Town II&quot; is the sequel to &quot;Not in
Our Town,&quot; the highly acclaimed story of the people of
Billings, MT who joined together when their neighbors were under
attack by white supremacists. The new program includes stories
from communities around the nation, in South Carolina, Illinois,
Ohio and Oregon. </p>
<p>The broadcast of &quot;Not in Our Town II&quot; coincides with
the second Not in Our Town Campaign, &quot;A Season of
Tolerance&quot;--a series of events designed to increase public
awareness of the danger of hate activity. The campaign begins
December 10 with a speaking tour of people who participated in
the Billings, MT response to hate. Seven weeks of video
screenings, town hall meetings and classroom lessons in
communities across the nation will follow, culminating with
activities planned in conjunction with the Martin Luther King,
Jr. Birthday holiday in January. </p>
<p><strong>Promote a Season of Tolerance' </strong></p>

<h2 align="center"><strong>A Rare Opportunity to Own a Classic
Labor Film </strong></h2>
<h1 align="center"><strong>Acclaimed Drama, '</strong><em><strong>The
Killing Floor</strong></em><strong>'</strong></h1>
<h1 align="center"><strong>Available on Video </strong></h1>
<p><strong>Videocassettes of the Sundance award-winning, widely
acclaimed labor film, </strong><em><strong>The Killing Floor</strong></em><strong>,
are now available directly from Made in USA Productions, the
non-profit company which produced the film. </strong></p>
<p>This compelling dramatic feature film (1985, 118 minutes,
color) tells the timeless, true story of the courageous drive to
build an interracial labor union in the Chicago Stockyards in the
face of the brutal efforts by management to divide the workforce
during the 1919 race riots. <em>The Killing Floor</em> is an Elsa
Rassbach Production directed, by Bill Duke, and stars Damien
Leake, Alfre Woodard, Clarence Felder, Dennis Farina and Moses
Gunn. The research effort was led by scholars David Brody and
William Tuttle. </p>
<p>Shown on PBS in the 1980s, this union-made production was
supported by more than 30 unions and the AFL-CIO, as well as
federal and foundation grants. Reviewers have often called <em>The
Killing Floor</em> &quot;brilliant.&quot; <em>The Village Voice</em>
wrote that it's the most &quot;clear-eyed account of union
organizing on film.&quot; </p>
<p>This classic film has long been unavailable but
life-of-cassette leases are now available to labor and community
groups at prices ranging from $89.95 for one cassette to $49.95
each for 100 or more cassettes, plus shipping and handling. 16mm
film rentals are also available. Made in USA Productions will use
all proceeds for new labor film projects. For information or to
order (video orders must be prepaid), contact: Made In USA
Productions, 220 East 23rd Street, Suite 707, New York, NY 10010;

<h2>Clerk Division Conference </h2>
<p>The Third Biennial Clerk Division Conference will convene in
Las Vegas, Nevada, Tuesday, November 11 through Thursday,
November 13, 1997. General Session is November 11 with workshops
on November 12 and 13. Conference registration will begin Monday,
November 10. </p>
<h2>Pre-conference Workshops </h2>
<p>Pre-Conference activities will consist of a REC Site meeting
on Saturday, November 8, and the Presidents' Conference Sunday,
November 9 and Monday, November 10. </p>
<h2>Saved Grade </h2>
<p>On Friday, December 6, 1996 the APWU arbitrated for employees'
right to both saved grade and protected rate. This would be
beneficial to employees who lose saved grade by failing to bid.
This was the first case before new National Arbitrator Shyan Das. </p>
<h2>National RI 399 </h2>
<p>Jurisdictional disputes are again moving through the system.
The National RI 399 Committee met December 5, 1996. Arbitration
dates are set for February and March. </p>
<h2>Step 4 Decision; Saved Grade and 90-day Bid Restrictions: </h2>
<p>The issue in this grievance is whether employees under a 90
day bid restriction lose saved grade if the restriction prevents
them from bidding on posted assignments. </p>
<p>As full settlement, the Postal Service agrees to establish a
waiver from bidding for an employee who is in a restrictive
period. Therefore, if an employee is legitimately entitled to
saved grade and is in a bid restriction period as called for in
the collective bargaining agreement, he/she will not lose the
saved grade because of being unable to bid. (Q94C-4Q-C-96042416)
(Guffey)</p>
<h2>Appeal to Arbitration: </h2>
<p>On January 2, 1997, the American Postal Workers Union,
appealed the creation and subcontracting of Corporate Call
Management (CCM) to Arbitration (Q94C-4Q-C-970006472). </p>
<p>The Clerk Craft is seeking information in these areas: </p>
<ol>
    <li>Finance Clerk-Finance Station--It has been reported that
        the United States Postal Service is using the Finance
        Clerk, Level 6, to lead more than three (3) clerks. This
        is in violation of the Memo Of Understanding that created
        the position. </li>
    <li>During the Christmas season, the Postal Service allowed
        the presort houses to distribute and process mail. If any
        cities other than Denver, Salt Lake City and Phoenix have
        experienced this contract violation, please contact Bob
        Tunstall at (202) 842-4220. </li>
    <li>Automated Bidding System--Automated Bidding System is
        strictly optional to the employee. Any attempt by
        Management to unilaterally implement an Automated Bidding
        System without options to the manual system has not been
        agreed to.</li>

Materiel Distribution Centers and Operating Services Facilities.
Support Services installations are located in Wilkes-Barre, PA;
Merrifield, VA; Washington, DC; Somerville, NJ; Topeka, KS;
Minneapolis, MN; St. Louis, MO and San Mateo, CA.</p>
<p>Separate contracts are negotiated for Support Services'
members. Their contracts basically mirror the National Agreement
in wages, benefits and working conditions. During 1994 contract
talks, APWU was successful in combining the Mail Equipment Shops
and the Materiel Distribution Centers into a new Article 41 under
the National Agreement. A goal of the Division is to merge with
the major crafts and work towards forming a true industrial
union. The Support Services Division is made up of a very diverse
bargaining unit. Members work in many specializations and job
classifications covering: clerical/technical work, computer
operations, programming, telecommunications, payroll processing,
customer support, manufacturing, warehousing and supply,
maintenance and custodial functions.</p>
<p>The Support Services Division contracts are administered by
NBA Greg Poferl (612) 854-0093 and Executive Assistant to the

<h2><a name="Q&amp;A">Questions and Answers On Establishing A
Union Safety Committee</a></h2>
<p><strong>What is the role of the Local Safety Committee?</strong></p>
<p>A union Local Safety Committee provides the union with a
formal procedure to discuss membership concerns and problems and
a means for solving those problems. The committee should also be
involved in on-site inspections and investigations of accidents
or incidents.</p>
<p><strong>How should the union committee be organized to meet
their objectives?</strong></p>
<p>The union should fulfill three primary goals in order to have
a strong Local Safety Committee:</p>
<p>1) <strong>Represent all workers</strong>. In order to fully
represent the concerns of the membership, the local union
president should ask for volunteers to serve as the union's
safety representatives throughout the facility. These safety
representatives should represent each craft at the facility so
that all safety and health issues can be brought to the attention
of the committee members.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Maintain communication with all members</strong>.
Sometimes the committee members are not the officers or stewards
of the local union. In these cases, the local union should be up
to date on the safety committee's activities so that they can
fully support the union committee members. The safety committee
should report on its activities at the local union meetings and
get input from the membership. The committee can also communicate
to the membership by creating leaflets and passing them out to
APWU members or posting information on the union bulletin board.
Include articles or start a column in the local newsletter to
cover pressing safety and health issues.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Educate committee participants and the general
membership</strong>. An effective local union committee is an
informed union committee. Committee members should stay current
with new laws, regulations, and policies put out by both OSHA and
USPS. Utilize local resources such as colleges to send members to
safety and health training classes. Participate in COSH
(Committee on Occupational Safety and Health) groups. COSH groups
are coalitions of labor and community organizations concerned
with worker safety and health issues. Create a library of
occupational safety and health resources and publications. Attain
access to management materials. Ultimately, the committee can put
on training programs for the membership to educate them about
safety and health issues.</p>
<p><strong>What are tactics for strengthening the local safety
committee?</strong></p>
<p>Since the committee's main goal is to improve working
conditions, following these guidelines will help achieve this
objective.</p>
<p>1) <strong>Involve the membership</strong>. Talk to fellow
workers about the safety and health problems they think exist in
the workplace. Talk to as many people as possible so that you get
a fair representation of the facility. Some members will want to
play a larger role in the committee than others. Keep this in
mind when assigning tasks and delegating responsibilities. The
committee and the membership participation can grow as it gains
experience and knowledge.</p>
<p>2)<strong> List safety and health problems</strong>. After
discussing working conditions with the membership, document their
concerns so that the committee can get an overview of the
problems they have to deal with.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Prioritize issues</strong>. Sometimes the
membership's concerns do not coincide with the committee's main
issues. For example, the membership may be concerned about
nuisance dust but the committee may want to focus on enforcing
the procedure for handling hazardous materials spills. Since you
are representing the membership, their issues should be dealt
with first.</p>
<p>4) <strong>Gain credibility from the membership and management</strong>.
The committee needs to accomplish its goals before the membership
and management will recognize that the committee means business.
This can be accomplished in two ways:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p align="left">(a) Meet the demands of the membership by
    dealing with their concerns first. Once you earn the support
    of the membership, then management should take you more
    seriously.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p>(b) Achieve small victories before tackling larger, more
    difficult problems. Keeping an aisle that leads to a fire
    exit continually clear is easier to accomplish than
    attempting to modify an LSM to eliminate ergonomic hazards.
    As the committee continues to accomplish small improvements
    in the workplace, the committee can deal with management more
    effectively to work on bigger issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>How does the committee solve health and safety
problems?</strong></p>
<p>The first step is to <strong>identify the problems or hazards</strong>
in the workplace. Small group discussions with committee members,
safety stewards, and other members can give the committee insight
about what problems exist. Second, <strong>select a problem to
solve or a hazard to abate</strong>. Choose the problem from the
list of priority membership concerns. Third, <strong>develop
strategies</strong> for solving the problem and determine
possible solutions. A plan of action could be as simple as
bringing management's attention to a hazard. Filing Form 1767
&quot;Report of Hazard, Unsafe Condition or Practice&quot; can
alert management to a problem. As a last resort, the committee
may need to resort to legal remedies to solve safety or health
problems. For more complicated problems, keep thorough
documentation to support a grievance or OSHA complaint. Sometimes
other government agencies, such as local fire departments, public
health departments, or building code or zoning agencies can be
helpful in resolving safety or health problems. Fourth, <strong>implement
the strategy and evaluate </strong>your activity regularly. The
safety committee should follow-up on their chosen strategy.
Evaluate the progress and choose another strategy if the original
plan is ineffective. The fifth and final step is to <strong>communicate
the committee's accomplishment</strong> to both management and
the membership.</p>
<p><strong>What are activities that a safety committee can do?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Communicate with the general membership to get
        information.</li>
    <li>Educate themselves and the general membership.</li>
    <li>Develop and conduct training programs.</li>
    <li>Review new machines and work procedures and propose
        changes.</li>
    <li>Know the USPS documents such as the chapter on safety and
        health in the ELM and contract language.</li>
    <li>Keep records.</li>
    <li>Conduct surveys.</li>
    <li>Review injury and illness records (Form CA 1 and 2).</li>
    <li>Maintain a resource center and library.</li>
    <li>Investigate incidents such as a hazardous materials
        spill.</li>
    <li>Conduct inspections using Form 1784-A.</li>
    <li>Sponsor outside events such as CPR training.</li>

<h3>HIV Home Test Kit/Mailer to Be Marketed</h3>
<p>In May 1996, the Food and Drug Administration finally approved
a long-awaited home test kit for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
The home test kit will enable consumers to take their own blood
samples at home and mail them to a medical laboratory in New
Jersey. A week later, they will obtain their test results via
phone, confidentially. They will also receive counseling and
referral services.</p>
<p>Developed by Direct Access Diagnostics, a subsidiary of
Johnson &amp; Johnson, the home test kit contains a lancet to
draw blood, a test card which holds the dried blood sample, a
personal identification number, and non-reusuable packaging and
mailing material. The test kit instructions are printed in both
English and Spanish.</p>
<p><strong>Packaging Exceeds CDC Requirements</strong></p>
<p>The Postal Service requires this home test kit to exceed the
minimum packaging required by the Center for Disease Control. The
envelope that will contain the dried blood sample is lined with
waterproof plastic. This sealed envelope must then be placed in a
cardboard box that is designed to be non-machineable and sent
first class. The APWU has reviewed the package in which the dried
blood sample will be mailed and is satisfied that postal workers
will not be endangered by it.</p>
<p>In order to test the effectiveness of its service. Direct
Access will sell the test kits only in Texas and Florida until
1997. There, the $40 test kit will be sold in pharmacies, college
health centers, public health clinics and through a toll-free
telephone number. If sales are successful, the kits will be
available nationwide in 1997.</p>
<p>Postal workers who will be handling these packages should
monitor the integrity of the mailing containers and report any
problems, such as breakage, to their local union as well as to
management. Local management should develop a procedure for
addressing exposure to damaged packages.</p>

<p><strong><u>Employers Should Reduce Risk Through Ergonomics</u></strong></p>
<h3>NIOSH Questions Effectiveness of Back Belts</h3>
<p>In 1994, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health (NIOSH) issued a report on the use of back belts to
prevent work-related back injuries. In &quot;Workplace Use of
Back Belts: Review and Recommendations,&quot; NIOSH concluded
that the effectiveness of back belts in reducing the risk for
back disorder, injuries, or pain &quot;remains unproven.&quot;
NIOSH formed its conclusions after extensively evaluating back
belt studies documented in scientific literature. Back belts
include abdominal supports or aids, spinal braces, supports,
corsets, weight-lifting belts, and other devices that are
&quot;designed&quot; to support and protect stomach and back
muscles.</p>
<p>While manufacturers contend that back belts prevent back
injuries caused by lifting, pushing, pulling, twisting, or
bending repetitively, NIOSH did not find any scientific evidence
to support this claim. In fact, NIOSH is concerned that back
belts may give workers a false sense of security regarding how
much they can safely lift. Workers who wear back belts may be at
further risk of injury if they attempt to lift bigger weight
loads than they would without the back belt. Furthermore, NIOSH
does not consider back belts to be equipment that effectively
protects workers from on-the-job hazards.</p>
<p>NIOSH reports that the most effective method to eliminate the
hazards associated with lifting is to &quot;redesign the work
environment and the work tasks.&quot; Instead of relying on back
belts to minimize the risk of injury, employers should implement
an ergonomics program to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>identify jobs that put workers at risk for back injuries;</li>
    <li>redesign equipment and work tasks to minimize the weight,
        range of motion, and frequency of lifting;</li>
    <li>train workers in proper lifting techniques and work
        practices; and</li>
    <li>medically monitor workers for signs or symptoms of back
        pain or injury.</li>
</ul>
<p>Management should not make back belts mandatory equipment, and
postal workers should consider NIOSH's recommendations before
wearing back belts. If you want more information on back belts or
ergonomic hazards, contact the APWU Safety and Health Department
or NIOSH (1-800-35-NIOSH).</p>

<p><strong><u>AIDS: A Union Issue, Part I</u></strong></p>
<h3>Dealing With AIDS in the Workplace</h3>
<p><em>Note: This is the first in a series of articles on AIDS
and how it may affect postal workers. Upcoming articles will
focus on the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens standard, how to help
union members with HIV/AIDS, and how to protect yourself and your
family.</em></p>
<p>Every day, 92 Americans die because of AIDS. As the crisis
grows, AIDS is affecting more and more of our union brothers and
sisters; currently, about 1 million Americans are HIV-infected.
Across the country, workers have faced numerous problems on the
job in conjunction with HIV/AIDS. In response, there is a growing
movement in the nation's unions to take action on these problems.</p>
<p><strong>What is AIDS?</strong></p>
<p>Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is caused by the
human innumodeficiency virus (HIV). The virus enters the body
through the bloodstream and attacks the immune system. The body
loses its ability to fight diseases that would not normally
affect a healthy person. The infections and diseases HIV patients
contract because of their weakened immune response are what make
them sick.</p>
<p>There is usually a long period between the time a person
becomes infected with HIV and the time they begin to show the
symptoms of AIDS, sometimes up to 10 years or more. People
infected with HIV can suffer extreme weight loss, severe and
recurrent pneumonia, brain tumors, rare skin cancer, blindness,
severe nausea, fatigue and other symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Are Postal Workers at Risk?</strong></p>
<p>Postal workers may be exposed to bloodborne
pathogens--disease-causing agents found in the blood--including
HIV, through medical specimens that go through the mail system.
If a spill of such blood or blood-containing materials occurs,
the USPS must comply with the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard set
by OSHA. USPS management instruction, &quot;Bloodborne Disease
Exposure Control Plans&quot; (EL-810-92-4) provides compliance
and policy guidelines for all postal facilities. Details on this
standard are included in part two of this series, &quot;Mail
Dangers: Biological, Infectious Materials.&quot;</p>
<p>Take note that on-the-job exposure to coworkers who have
HIV/AIDS does <em>not</em> constitute a risk of infection. You
cannot be infected by the HIV virus by working with someone who
has it. Despite this fact, many workers living with HIV/AIDS face
discrimination and harassment in the workplace--not only from
their employers, but even from their own union brothers and
sisters!</p>
<p>Fear of working with someone who has HIV/AIDS is
unnecessary--it is impossible to get HIV/AIDS from sharing a
phone, a water fountain, machinery, rest rooms or food. There are
very few ways to contract the AIDS virus.</p>
<p><strong>How is HIV Transmitted?</strong></p>
<p>For HIV to be spread, the infected blood, semen or vaginal
secretions of an infected person must enter the bloodstream of
another person. Outside the body, the virus is very fragile and
is easily killed.</p>
<p>There are only three ways a person can become infected by HIV:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><em>Sexual contact.</em> The virus is most commonly
    transmitted through contact with an HIV-infected person's
    sexual fluids during vaginal and anal intercourse and oral
    sex.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p><em>Blood-to-blood</em> <em>contact</em>. The virus can be
    transmitted by: sharing or reusing contaminated needles and
    syringes; being accidentally stuck by a contaminated syringe
    or sharp object; having infected blood come into contact with
    damaged skin (cuts, etc.); having large quantities of
    infected blood splashed in the eyes or mouth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p><em>Mother to newborn. </em>A mother who is infected with
    the virus can infect her child during pregnancy or delivery
    or by breast feeding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>HIV<em> cannot </em>be spread by coughing or sneezing, sharing
work equipment and rest rooms, shaking hands or hugging. Research
has shown that family members of persons with AIDS have not been
infected with the virus through normal household contact.</p>
<p><strong>Who is at Risk?</strong></p>
<p>Anyone who has unprotected sex with a person whose health
status they don't know about (you can't tell if someone has HIV
by the way they look), or who shares needles, may be at risk to
AIDS exposure. If you don't have sex or if you only have sex with
one mutually faithful partner who you know is not infected, and
neither of you &quot;shoots&quot; drugs, then you are not at
risk. Otherwise, you are at risk, regardless of your age, race,
gender or sexual orientation. Latex condoms are 98 percent
effective in preventing the transmission of HIV if they are used
properly and consistently.</p>
<p><strong>What Must Locals Do?</strong></p>
<p>Unions have a dual responsibility regarding AIDS. They must
both protect the health and safety of workers who may be exposed
to AIDS and other infectious agents on the job, and safeguard the
rights of members who have HIV/AIDS. Fighting against
discrimination has always been central to the union cause. Union
leaders must be ready to reach out to workers with AIDS, and to
battle against possible discrimination.</p>
<p>The rights of HIV-positive postal workers are protected under
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. USPS policy provides for treating
HIV/AIDS the same as any other medical condition in terms of job
assignments and accomodation. The policy also calls for
addressing workplace issues such as misconceptions among workers.
Nevertheless, if people do have a problem with unfair treatment,
locals may need to file grievances on their behalf. When people
with HIV/AIDS face discrimination or harassment, whether by
management or by their coworkers, it is the local's
responsibility to help overcome these difficulties.</p>
<p>In addition, AIDS-infected union members may need assistance
in non-work-related areas, such as filing medical and/or
disability claims, or getting assistance through community
programs and other sources of help. More information on how
locals can help members with HIV/AIDS is included in part three
of this series, &quot;Support Union Members Living with
HIV/AIDS.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Education: Putting Away Fears</strong></p>
<p>Workers who are anxious about contracting HIV/AIDS from
infected coworkers should be reassured that they are in no
danger. Many people may have questions about the disease. Locals
that wish to address this need--whether they are experiencing a
problem or want to avoid one--should arrange AIDS education for

<p><strong><u>AIDS: A Union Issue, Part II</u></strong></p>
<h3>Mail Dangers: Biological, Infectious Materials</h3>
<p>In 1992, an improperly prepared, unmarked package containing
live tuberculosis cultures was mailed from a hospital in New York
City to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, GA. En route,
the package was damaged and several of the test tubes containing
the cultures were broken, possibly exposing numerous postal
workers to drug-resistant strains of TB.</p>
<p>This incident points to a serious situation involving
hazardous materials in the mail.</p>
<p>This article will review hazards and procedures related to
bloodborne pathogens and other hazardous materials in the mail
stream. It is important that workers who handle medical mail and
other potentially infectious material, and union representatives,
obtain the original documents dealing with these hazards. This
overview cannot cover the many important details necessary to
protect workers.</p>
<p>Since the National Agreement requires compliance with all OSHA
standards, postal workers who come in contact with biological and
infectious materials in the mail are protected by OSHA's
Bloodborne Pathogens Standard (29 CFR 1910.1030). Boodborne
pathogens are disease-causing agents found in the blood, and
include, among others, HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, and HBV,
which causes hepatitis B, a serious liver disease. There is a
greater risk of contamination by the HBV virus because it can
survive for long periods under many environmental conditions. The
AIDS virus is more fragile, but can still be infectious when
contained in blood samples and other blood-containing fluids.</p>
<p>There are three types of infectious materials that may be sent
through the mail; etiologic agents (infectious agents such as
viruses); diagnostic specimens (such as blood samples); and
biological products (vaccines).</p>
<p><strong>Mailing/Labeling Requirements </strong></p>
<p>Public Health Service regulations require that etiologic
agents must have a proper label, including the
&quot;biohazard&quot; figure. The label is not required on
diagnostic or biological materials, but these should be labeled
for contents.</p>
<p>USPS rules require mail containing such materials to be
packaged in a waterproof inner container, nonpermeable to the
contents, surrounded by sufficient absorbent materials to take up
the contents in case of leakage. The inner container and
cushioning should be placed in an outer nonpermeable container.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/biohaz.jpg" align="bottom"
width="75" height="75"></p>
<p align="center">(biohazard symbol)</p>
<p><strong>Personal Protective Equipment</strong></p>
<p>The Bloodborne Pathogens Standard requires that personal
protective equipment--such as gloves, gowns, face shields and eye
protection--be used when other controls, such as the mailing
requirements noted above, do not eliminate risk. This is the case
in the post office, since materials are not always marked or
contained properly. The USPS must also provide hand-washing
facilities for employees who are occupationally exposed to
bloodborne pathogens.</p>
<p>It is the Postal Service's responsibility to provide
protective equipment and to ensure that it is used properly.</p>
<p>The Bloodborne Pathogens Standard also requires the USPS to
offer hepatitis B vaccine to employees who face occupational
exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials.</p>
<p><strong>Exposure Control Plan</strong></p>
<p>In accordance with the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard, MI
EL-810-92-4 requires each postal facility to develop a written
exposure control plan. The plan must be accessible to employees
and their representatives.</p>
<p>If an exposure incident occurs, an incident report (Form 1770)
and an investigation report (Form 1769) must be completed. The
exposed worker must be provided with first aid, medical testing
(results kept confidential), counseling and post-exposure
treatment that includes, if the worker hasn't already received
one, a hepatitis B vaccination. These procedures must be included
in the exposure control plan.</p>
<p><strong>Workers Subject to Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens</strong></p>
<p>According to Management Instruction EL-810-92-4,
&quot;Bloodborne Disease Exposure Control Plans,&quot;
occupationally exposed workers include all persons designated to
clean up spills and leaks of mailed hazardous materials that
include blood and other infectious materials, as well as other
employees outside APWU's bargaining units. Workers who may be
defined as occupationally exposed, depending on individual
circumstances, are clerks, mail handlers and other personnel if
they routinely handle mailed blood specimens or other items
potentially containing bloodborne pathogens, or who handle mailed
or internally generated medical wastes, including sharps.
&quot;Occupational exposure&quot; means reasonably anticipated
contact with blood, or other potentially infectious materials,
that may result from performing one's job.</p>
<p>The Bloodborne Pathogens Standard requires employers to
determine which workers may be exposed and to give information
and training to all such occupationally exposed workers at the
time of initial assignment, and to repeat and update the training
yearly.</p>
<p><strong>USPS Fails to Protect Workers</strong></p>
<p>A recent letter from OSHA to USPS Vice President for Employee
Relations William Henderson shows that the Postal Service has not
been complying with the regulation requiring hepatitis B
vaccination. The letter states, in part, &quot;...the statement
by the USPS that, 'OSHA's determination that persons handling
mail items which may contain bloodborne pathogens are...[at] low
risk,' is without merit and clearly not supported by OSHA's
policy...USPS should identify those workers who must be provided
with a vaccination and make the vaccination available.&quot;</p>
<p>The APWU has filed a national level grievance against the USPS
for failing to comply with the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard,
including training requirements and implementing proper
procedures for handling hazardous materials and bloodborne
pathogens. The case is currently in arbitration.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p>
<p>Postal workers should become familiar with the Bloodborne
Pathogens Standard, your facility's exposure control plan, and
Management Instruction EL-810-92-4. If your job subjects you to
potential exposure to biological materials, make sure the Postal
Service provides you with appropriate training.</p>
<p>The key to eliminating or reducing the risk of exposure is to
take action before an incident occurs. Work with your local to
ensure that the OSHA standard is enforced.</p>

<p><u>AIDS: A Union Issue, Part III</u></p>
<h3>Support Union Members Living With HIV/AIDS</h3>
<p>Many union members have been affected by the AIDS crisis in
America, but even more will be affected in the future. The labor
force is a high-risk group for HIV infection--75 percent of AIDS
cases are among people between the ages of 25 and 44. Unions must
respond.</p>
<p>One of the most important things a local union can do is to be
a source of help and support for union members living with HIV.
When people don't know where else to go for help, the local union
can be an important resource and a good place to start.</p>
<p>Most people infected with HIV remain healthy for about 10
years. However, they need frequent medical attention to monitor
and slow the progression of the disease. Once AIDS-related
problems begin, they will need more frequent medical treatments
and may start using more leave. Their needs in other areas may
increase as well.</p>
<p><strong>What Locals Can Do</strong></p>
<p>Following are some of the ways locals can assist with issues,
problems and needs facing union members with HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p><strong>Assist with health care, disability and retirement
paperwork.</strong> Members with HIV may need help with the
selection of an appropriate health plan and supplemental
disability insurance, and with filling out claims. Most people
living with HIV/AIDS want to work as long as possible. However,
eventually they will probably leave on disability. Assistance in
planning that transition would greatly benefit anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Locate sources of support and assistance</strong>.
Identify sources of benefits such as local, state and federal
government programs, the religious community, and AIDS and other
community organizations. Probably the best place to start is the
AFL-CIO Community Services Department. Contact your Central Labor
Council or <a href="http://www.unitedway.org/aids.html">United
Way</a> Community Services liaison.</p>
<p><strong>Protect rights.</strong> Be familiar with members'
rights under the Rehabilitation Act and the Family and Medical
Leave Act, and assure those rights are observed.</p>
<p><strong>Assist with getting reasonable accommodations
implemented</strong>. These may include flexible work schedules
to allow for frequent medical appointments, light duty, and/or
extra break periods and a place to rest.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain confidentiality.</strong> Many workers with
HIV/AIDS have faced harassment from employers and
coworkers--hence, many try to keep their medical information
secret. If coworkers are aware a person is HIV positive, show
visible support--shake hands, ask how they're doing and whether
you can help. Educate others to combat discrimination.</p>
<p><strong>Provide financial assistance</strong>. This is
especially needed in the time period immediately after a person
stops working and before disability and public assistance
programs begin. Bureaucracy often creates this gap, and the delay
can be months long.</p>
<p><strong>Offer emotional support.</strong> Offer support to
members infected and <strong>affected</strong> by HIV. <strong>Affected</strong>
means a loved one has the disease; a member may need help coping
as well as finding assistance for that person.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways Locals Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Some other things a person living with HIV may need include:
donations of leave time; legal assistance--for example, for
living wills, wills, power of attorney, insurance disputes, and
discrimination; low-income housing; and assistance with
day-to-day needs such as shopping, cooking and housekeeping.</p>

<p><strong><u>AIDS: A Union Issue, Part IV</u></strong></p>
<h3>Protect Yourself From HIV Infection</h3>
<p>In 1989, Stan Baer, a 14-year-old living in a rural area of
California, had his first sexual encounter. He soon discovered
that his first experience with sex--unprotected--had a result few
would have anticipated. He was infected with HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS.</p>
<p>Although AIDS has long struck every segment of our society,
many people feel that they are not at risk because of who they
are or where they live. AIDS is not a problem limited to
homosexuals, drug users and inner city residents, and it is not
limited to certain age groups. Many people in their 20s who
discover they are HIV positive were actually infected as
teenagers.</p>
<p>In the United States, AIDS is the second leading cause of
death among men aged 25 to 44, but the fastest growing groups of
individuals becoming infected with HIV are heterosexual women and
adolescents. AIDS is the sixth leading cause of death among
people aged 15 to 24.</p>
<p><strong>How HIV is Spread</strong></p>
<p>To protect yourself and your family, it is important to learn
the facts about how HIV is spread and how to avoid infection. HIV
is transmitted through body fluids such as blood, semen and
vaginal fluid. However, there are relatively few ways to become
infected.</p>
<p><strong>Sexual Contact</strong></p>
<p>The most frequent transmission of HIV is through sexual
contact, when HIV can enter through cuts or sores. These cuts may
be so small that you are not even aware of them. Because it often
takes 10 years for an infected person to become sick, many don't
show any symptoms, and may not even know they are infected. If
you have sex with such a person, you can get the virus from them
without even knowing it.</p>
<p>The only sure way to avoid infection from sexual contact is to
abstain from sex, or to have sexual contact with only one person
who is not infected and who only has sex with you. Latex condoms
help prevent HIV infection and other diseases when they are used
properly and consistently, but they are not foolproof.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Needles</strong></p>
<p>Sharing needles or syringes is a high-risk factor for HIV
infection. Sharing needles to inject IV drugs is the most
dangerous behavior, but the virus can also be transmitted through
needles used to inject steroids and those used for tattooing and
ear piercing. If you plan to get a tattoo or have your ears
pierced, be sure to go to a qualified person who uses unused or
sterile equipment. Ask the person to explain their safety
measures.</p>
<p><strong>Pregnancy</strong></p>
<p>A pregnant woman who is infected with HIV can pass the virus
to her child during pregnancy, childbirth or breast feeding. If
you are planning to become pregnant, and you think your current
or past activities may have put you at risk for AIDS, you should
get tested before you become pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>Blood Transfusions</strong></p>
<p>The risk of getting AIDS from a blood transfusion in the
United States is extremely small. Since 1985, blood donors have
been screened for risky behavior, and all donated blood is
tested. It is not possible to get HIV by giving blood, since
donation equipment is used only once and then destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>Teaching Children</strong></p>
<p>Because teenagers are at risk for AIDS, it is important for
parents to educate them about the risks of using drugs and
becoming sexually active. Many teens think that young people
don't get AIDS, and that belief puts them at greater risk. If you
are a parent, talk to your children. If you need help, advice or
information, call the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) AIDS
hotline at the number listed below. They will provide information
for addressing children of any age. Ask for their &quot;AIDS
Prevention Guide.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Evaluate Your Risk</strong></p>
<p>Certain behaviors put you at greater risk for HIV infection.
Evaluate your risk and seek further information from the CDC or
local AIDS organizations.</p>
<p>The AIDS virus has been in the United States since at least
1978. If any of the following have applied to you since then, you
may be at increased risk of infection:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Shared needles or syringes to inject drugs or steroids.</li>
    <li>If you are a male, had sex with other males.</li>
    <li>Had sex with someone who you believe may have been
        infected with HIV.</li>
    <li>Had a sexually transmitted disease (STD).</li>
    <li>Received a blood transfusion or blood products between
        1978 and 1985.</li>
    <li>Had sex with someone who would answer yes to any of the
        above questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these statements apply to you, you should discuss
your need for testing with a trained counselor. You should also
seek testing and counseling if you have had sex with someone and
you didn't know their risk behavior, or if you have had many
sexual partners in the last 10 years.</p>
<p>Even though symptoms of AIDS usually don't appear for years, a
test can reveal HIV infection within six months of infection or
sooner. Although there is no cure for AIDS, much research is
being done, and new treatments help HIV-infected people to live
healthier and longer. If you are infected, early detection can
help you begin medical treatments that will slow the progress of
the disease.</p>
<p><strong>Seek More Information</strong></p>
<p>To ask any questions about AIDS, call the Centers for Disease
Control National AIDS Hotline at 1-800-342-AIDS; TDD,
1-800-AIDS-TTY; Spanish, 1-800-344-SIDA.</p>
<p>In addition to confidentially answering any question related
to HIV infection and AIDS, the hotline's information specialists
can send you written materials, and refer you to organizations
and facilities in your area where you can get information,
counseling and testing. </p>

<p><strong><u>Safety and Health</u></strong></p>
<h3>Indoor Air Pollution</h3>
<p>In recent studies, the <a href="http://www.epa.gov">Environmental
Protection Agency </a>has concluded that indoor air pollution is
one of the top five environmental health risks to the public.
Furthermore, the EPA estimates that indoor air pollution is
costing society billions of dollars each year in the form of
medical costs, lost productivity due to absences, lost worker
efficiency, and damage to equipment and machinery.</p>
<p>Poor indoor air quality can be a serious health threat. Postal
workers are at risk from many problems associated with indoor air
pollution due to the excessive amounts of dust, heavy machinery,
an assortment of chemicals and other factors. These conditions,
combined with management's desire to control utility costs by
limiting the use of the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning
systems (HVAC), can cause short- and long-term health effects.</p>
<p><strong>Health Effects</strong></p>
<p>Complaints of symptoms of certain diseases such as asthma,
Legionnaire's disease, hypersensitivity pneumonitis and allergic
dermatitis often can be attributed to a specific indoor air
pollutant or contaminant. When the causative agent of a
diagnosable illness is identified, it is referred to as a
building-related illness. Radon, asbestos, environmental
(second-hand) tobacco smoke, molds and viruses are often the
culprits of building-related illnesses.</p>
<p>More often, however, many symptoms cannot be identified with a
particular disease. Complaints of headaches, eye, nose and throat
irritation, nausea, fatigue, irritability, sneezing and coughing
are more difficult to pinpoint to a specific cause or a single
pollutant. These types of complaints are often linked to sick or
tight building syndrome (SBS).</p>
<p><strong>Sick Building Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>The phenomenon of sick building syndrome emerged as a result
of the energy crisis of the 1970s. In an effort to save money by
reducing energy costs, engineers, architects and building owners
designed sealed, air-tight buildings that were dependent upon
mechanical ventilation systems to maximize energy efficiency and
control indoor environmental conditions. The effect on workers'
health still requires further research and examination.</p>
<p>Factors contributing to sick building syndrome are numerous
and are usually a combination of several sources. These factors
range from inadequate ventilation, indoor pollutants, outside
sources and biological contaminants (bacteria, mold and pollen).
Other factors affecting indoor air quality include the number of
building occupants, the type of work performed, and activities
that produce dust, emissions or odors.</p>
<p><strong>Control Measures</strong></p>
<p>When the source of contaminated or poor air quality is
targeted, corrective action can include employing industrial
hygiene control methods to remedy the building-related illness.
For sick building syndrome, the problems are often more difficult
to identify and may take thorough investigation to resolve.</p>

<p><strong><u>Safety and Health</u></strong></p>
<h3>Is Asbestos a Problem in Your Facility?</h3>
<p>In 1988, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimated
that 700,000 public and commercial buildings contain friable
(easily crumbled) &quot;asbestos-containing materials&quot;
(ACMs). Furthermore, over two-thirds of these buildings are
suspected to contain damaged asbestos. What is the likelihood
that your facility contains asbestos that could cause
irreversible damage to your health?</p>
<p>With active local union involvement, asbestos does not have to
be a problem in your facility.</p>
<p><strong>Where It Is; What It Does</strong></p>
<p>Asbestos is the name given to six different naturally
occurring fibrous minerals that are used in building construction
for many purposes. The most common forms of asbestos used in
building materials are chrysotile, amosite, and crocidolite. ACMs
are usually found in pipe insulation, sprayed-on fireproofing and
sound-insulating materials, floor and ceiling tiles and boiler
rooms. ACMs are generally located in areas that are not
accessible to the general public, but maintenance and custodial
workers are most likely to come into contact with ACMs and are
often subject to exposure.</p>
<p>When disturbed and released into the air, asbestos fibers may
be inhaled into the lungs where they remain forever. The level of
exposure to asbestos affects the risk of developing a respiratory
disease. Although exposure to higher levels of asbestos may
result in early development of an asbestos-related disease, most
symptoms do not begin to appear until 10 to 40 years after
exposure. Three diseases have been linked to asbestos exposure:
lung cancer, mesothelioma (lung cancer caused by asbestos), and
asbestosis (scarring of the lung tissue).</p>
<p><strong>Defining the Risks</strong></p>
<p>Asbestos becomes problematic when it is disturbed, has
deteriorated, or has been damaged. If ACM remains intact and
undisturbed, it bears no health risk to building occupants. ACM
must be properly maintained and managed to prevent accidental or
intentional disturbance. In fact, the postal facility manager is
required to establish an Operations &amp; Maintenance (O&amp;M)
program to identify and control ACMs. The O&amp;M is mandated in
a Management Instruction, &quot;Asbestos-Containing Building
Materials Control Program.&quot;</p>
<p>O&amp;M plans are recommended by the EPA to ensure that ACMs
are maintained in good condition, cleaned up properly when
released, prevented from further release, and monitored for
condition.</p>
<p>The O&amp;M plan requires that all postal-owned and -leased
facility managers comply with the following program elements:</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>Inspection</em> to identify and assess all ACMs.</li>
    <li><em>Management </em>and frequent monitoring of ACMs.</li>
    <li><em>Abatement </em>of sprayed-on fireproofing and
        sound-insulating materials.</li>
    <li><em>Enforcement</em> of work practices that prevent the
        release of ACMs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What Locals Can Do</strong></p>
<p>To prevent asbestos from becoming a serious health hazard,
locals should determine the location and condition of ACMs in the
facilities they represent by requesting from management a copy of
each facility's Operation &amp; Maintenance Plan and Management
Instruction, MI EL-810-94-3.</p>
<p>Also, the <a href="http://www.epa.gov">EPA</a> publishes an
informative guide to controlling asbestos entitled,
&quot;Managing Asbestos in Place: A Building Owner's Guide to
Operations and Maintenance Programs for Asbestos-Containing
Materials.&quot; This reference document can be obtained by
calling the EPA's Toxic Substances Hotline at 202-554-1404; TDD

<p><strong><u>Safety and Health</u></strong></p>
<h3>Understaffing Causes Backlash</h3>
<p>Are you suffering from fatigue? Do you feel stressed? Are more
accidents occuring than usual? Have you had a hazardous materials
spill or incident? Are you working more overtime than usual? Do
you need more help to do your job? Is your facility or office
understaffed?</p>
<p>Postal Service restructuring and downsizing may have serious
implications on the safety and health of all postal workers. As
of October 1992, some 33,000 bargaining unit employees had taken
advantage of the USPS' early-out/optional retirement program.</p>
<p>This greatly reduced workforce can result in understaffing in
a particular area of a facility. When there are not enough people
to do the required work, workers are forced to rush and to
practice unsafe procedures, such as improper lifting techniques,
in order to make up for the decrease in staff. Consequently,
understaffing is one of the chief causes of accidents and adverse
health effects.</p>
<p><strong>Safety Hazards</strong></p>
<p>Understaffing that causes an increased workload or work pace
may impact the number and severity of workplace injuries. For
instance, since workers may be required to lift bags of mail or
push heavy carts without the assistance of a coworker, back
injuries may be more prevalent. Due to a reduction in the number
of sweepers, workers may be apt to perform improper lifting and
bending techniques in order to keep up with machine-paced work.
An increase in machine-paced work may put clerks at further risk
of developing repetitive motion injuries, such as carpal tunnel
syndrome and tendinitis.</p>
<p>Furthermore, time constraints may prevent a worker from taking
the necessary steps to prevent injury. For example, maintenance
crews may be particularly susceptible to time pressures and
forego safety precautions, such as employing machine guard and
lockout procedures before repairing machinery or wearing
appropriate personal protective equipment. In addition, a limited
custodial staff can lead to potential housekeeping hazards such
as blocked aisles, slippery walkways and littered floor areas.
Ultimately, the safety of workers may be jeopardized when fewer
employees are able to carefully label, handle and sort mail
containing hazardous materials. All workers should ensure that
they are provided the required training for handling both
hazardous materials and biological hazards.</p>
<p><strong>Health Hazards</strong></p>
<p>The health effects associated with understaffing are less
evident than the safety hazards. Understaffing that generates
increased workloads and work speedups, combined with a lack of
job control, may increase the risk of stress-related diseases. It
has been well documented that understaffing exacerbates the
effects of stress-related illnesses, such as heart disease, high
blood pressure, digestive disorders, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Repercussions?</strong></p>
<p>It may require more time to perform a job safely; but do not
forego safety for the sake of productivity. Ask for assistance
when you need to perform onerous tasks. When performing a job,
exercise safety precautions and proper procedures. If a hazardous
situation develops in your workplace, contact your safety and
health representative or APWU steward or other officer. Your
local union will bring the hazardous condition to the attention
of the Joint Local Safety Committee or OSHA (Occupational Safety
and Health Administration).</p>
<p>A decrease in staff size should be accompanied by an
appropriate reduction in workload. As the Postal Service's safety
philosophy prescribes (ELM, Chapter 8), &quot;It is good business
from the standpoint of both efficiency and economy to prevent
personal injuries on and off the job. In addition to humanitarian
considerations, injuries cost money and reduce efficiency.&quot;</p>
<p>In the long term, the effects of understaffing may prove to be
more costly in productivity, as well as in injuries, to the
Postal Service. Although the USPS warrants conditions that may
jeopardize the health and safety of its employees, workers must
always consider safety first, as it is a precondition of all work
activity.</p>

<h3>Are You at Risk?</h3>
<p>Alert! All postal workers should be aware of the threat of
occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens. Bloodborne
pathogens are disease-causing agents found in the blood that
include HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, and HBV, the virus that
causes Hepatitis B, a serious liver disease.</p>
<p>The Postal Service is responsible for taking measures to
protect workers from the risk of occupational exposure to
biological hazards, since mail containing these biological
hazards or other infectious materials is shipped through the USPS
every day. Often, it is impossible to tell if a package accepted
for shipment by the Postal Service contains hazardous materials.
Clerks are particularly susceptible to stabs and punctures by
hypodermic needles and other medical &quot;sharps&quot; contained
in unmarked and improperly packaged shipments. In addition,
employees risk exposure from spills of packages containing blood
samples, medical wastes and other biological specimens. Those who
work in facilities near medical waste disposal companies or
hospitals are subject to further risk of exposure because of the
large mail volume to and from the centers.</p>
<p><strong>A New Standard</strong></p>
<p>In an effort to reduce or eliminate exposure to bloodborne
diseases, the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA) introduced a new standard titled
Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens. The standard
became effective March 6, 1992, and all requirements should have
been operational by July 6, 1992. This standard aims to protect
over 5.6 million workers against exposure to bloodborne
pathogens.</p>
<p>Since the APWU National Agreement requires compliance with all
OSHA standards, the Postal Service issued a managment
instruction, &quot;Bloodborne Disease Exposure Control
Plans,&quot; to provide compliance and policy guidelines for all
postal facilities. The standard as outlined in the management
instruction requires local management to identify exposed and
potentially exposed personnel and to establish an exposure
control plan.</p>
<p><strong>Exposure Control Plan</strong></p>
<p>Each field division facility, managment sectional center, bulk
mail center and office must develop and maintain a plan that
identifies each job and job-task which may expose workers to
biological materials, as well as determine how to minimize or
eliminate these exposures.</p>
<p>The standard also requires that the Postal Service:</p>
<ul>
    <li>follow &quot;univerisal precautions&quot;: treat all
        biological materials as if they are contaminated and
        potentially infectious;</li>
    <li>provide personal protective equipment, such as gloves,
        aprons, face shields and goggles to workers who handle or
        frequently come into contact with biological materials;</li>
    <li>implement engineering controls to minimize risk of
        exposure, including hand-washing facilities, and follow
        proper packaging procedures (see Postal Bulletin 21820,
        7-23-92, pp. 8-10, &quot;Mailability of Sharps and Other
        Used Medical Devices&quot;);</li>
    <li>provide training every year to all employees who may be
        potentially exposed to infectious material. The training
        must be provided by a person &quot;knowledgeable in the
        subject matter,&quot; such as a physician, nurse or
        safety and health specialist. The OSHA standard and
        management instruction specifies the content of the
        training. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When an Incident Occurs</strong></p>
<p>Both an incident report (Form 1770) and an investigation
report (Form 1769) must be completed if an injury or exposure
involving biological materials occurs. The exposed worker must be
provided with first-aid, medical testing (results kept
confidential), counseling and post-exposure treatment that
includes a Hepatitis B vaccination. These procedures must be
included in the Exposure Control Plan. </p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p>
<p>You can:</p>
<ul>
    <li>request from managment a copy of your facility's Exposure
        Control Plan, Management Instruction EL-810-92-4, and
        OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.1030 to verify that the plan
        meets the standard's requirements;</li>
    <li>ensure that the Postal Service provide you with the
        required training if you are potentially exposed to
        biological materials;</li>
    <li>contact your local union for more information.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key to eliminating or minimizing the risk of exposure to
biological hazardous materials is to take action before an
incident occurs by enforcing the OSHA standard and USPS policy.</p>

<h3>Do You Handle Hazardous Materials Safely?</h3>
<p>Are you cautious in your acceptance and handling of hazardous
materials? Do you know what a &quot;Tag 44&quot; is? What should
you do in case of a leak or spill?</p>
<p>All clerks should know the answers to these questions for
their own and their coworkers' protection. All workers are
referred to several postal publications that deal with hazardous
materials--from acceptance to handling, and from tagging to
cleaning up spills.</p>
<p>Article 14, Section D of the National Agreement requires that
the USPS have a safety program for employees who handle hazardous
materials. Hazardous materials are described in Part 124.3 of the
Domestic Mail Manual, and include all clinical specimens and
biological products that are properly mailable (DMM 124.38).</p>
<p>A management instruction entitled &quot;Bloodborne Disease
Exposure Control Plans,&quot; issued 5/1/92, details what
management should be doing now--identifying employees who may be
exposed to bloodborne contaminants. Window clerks, pouch rack
clerks, clerks who handle small parcels, rolls or regular
parcels--or any clerk concerned that they may be in contact with
mail of this nature--should check to see if management has
identified them for special training. If not, they should request
this training.</p>
<p>Another management instruction, entitled &quot;Responses to
Hazardous Materials Releases&quot; EL-810-96-1, requires that
&quot;every employee who is involved in <em>handling</em> or
accepting hazardous materials&quot; must have Handbook EL
812-Hazardous Materials available. This instruction also requires
that <em>all</em> potentially affected employees must be given
PEDC Course #21511-00, Hazardous Materials Acceptance and
Handling. Ask for this training. Don't take chances with your
health.</p>
<p><strong>Tag 44, Form 1767</strong></p>
<p>Publication 52--Part 227, Tag 44 for Hazardous Matter, states:</p>
<p>&quot;Any sack or other consolidation device containing
hazardous matter must have a Tag 44, Sack Contents Warning,
attached. Remove Tag 44 when the hazardous matter is no longer in
the sack or consolidation device.&quot;</p>
<p>A window clerk who accepts any hazardous material must place a
Tag 44 on the consolidation device to let opening unit employees
or the next employee handling the sack, tub or other container
know that a hazardous material is enclosed. Publication 52 also
states, &quot;handle all packages carefully. Do not throw, drop
or slide packages.&quot; Carriers who collect mail from boxes
which contain hazardous material, such as medical centers, should
also receive training and tag sacks. If this is not being done,
file a Form 1767 &quot;Report of Hazard, Unsafe Condition or
Practice.&quot;</p>
<p>Opening unit employees, clerks and mail handlers should also
receive training in handling pre-identified hazardous
packages/letters and identifying other hazardous packages
carefully. When the mail is placed into the next container, that
container should be properly tagged. Pouch rate clerks who
receive a container labeled with a Tag 44 then will know to watch
for the hazardous material; they should also place a Tag 44 on
the dispatch container. This procedure is mandatory.</p>
<p><strong>Leaks or Spills</strong></p>
<p>If a spill or leak occurs, only properly trained individuals,
using proper ventilation and protective equipment, should touch
the mail (EL 801, Supervisors Safety Handbook, Appendix A pages
13-14; Management Instruction EL-810-96-1, Responses to Hazardous
Materials Releases.</p>

<h2 align="left">COSH groups</h2>
<p align="left">APWU local unions are encouraged to join and
participate in &quot;COSH&quot; groups (Committees on
Occupational Safety and Health). Organized throughout the
country, COSH groups work closely with local unions in trying to
improve workplace safety and health conditions. Volunteers, such
as labor lawyers, health professionals, and labor leaders work
with a small COSH staff to offer many services to local unions,
including training, education, technical assistance, and support
in other safety and health and union activities. COSH groups are
also active in lobbying state legislatures to improve safety,
health, and workers' compensation laws.</p>
<p align="left">Some APWU locals are especially active in the
COSH groups in their cities. APWU local leaders in North Carolina
and Massachusetts, for example, have served terms on the COSH
groups' boards of directors. If your local is not already a
member of a COSH group, encourage your local leadership to join.
If a COSH group does not exist in your state, contact your local
labor council to discuss how to start one with the other local
unions in your area.</p>

RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>  is
a unique, patented surfactant copolymer that significantly reduces
blood viscosity and inhibits platelet adhesion. In a Phase II
clinical trial, RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I> showed statistically
significant benefits in reducing the severe pain that patients
suffering from acute sickle cell crisis must endure. This trial
also indicated that RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>  may reduce the
duration of hospital stays. This is an important market for CytRx
as each year there are approximately 100,000 hospital admissions
for acute sickle cell crisis as well as a large number of patients
who suffer at home. Reducing the duration and severity of crisis
could provide significant health benefits as over time, organ
systems deteriorate due to damage caused by each sickle cell crisis.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>CytRx Corporation</FONT></B><BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>12/9/96 Conference Call</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT>Good Morning.  I'm Jim Yahres, CytRx's
Vice President of Investor Relations.  It is always a pleasure
to report good news, and for CytRx 1996 has been a year of good
news.  From the creation of Vetlife's cattle business unit, to
Vaxcel's initiation of Optivax&#174; clinical trials, to
the decision to move purified RheothRx&#174;<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>
back into the clinic.  Now, we have very special news -- the actualization
of one of CytRx's primary strategic objectives by taking Vaxcel
public. But  the agreement with Zynaxis  goes far beyond just
enabling Vaxcel to become a public company.  This merger will
create a vaccine delivery company with both oral and injectable
technologies.  I will now turn this over to Jack Luchese, CytRx's
President and CEO,  to talk about the agreement. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT>------------------------------------------------------------</FONT></B></CENTER>
<CENTER><I><B><FONT SIZE=3>It is always
a pleasure to report good news, and for CytRx 1996 has been a
year<BR>
 of good news.</FONT></B></I></CENTER>
<CENTER><B><FONT>-------------------------------------------------
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT>Thank you.  As Jim said, with this transaction
CytRx is executing our previously announced strategy of taking
our wholly-owned subsidiaries public.  This will provide CytRx
shareholders with <U>recognizable</U> subsidiary value as Vaxcel
trades in the public markets. So we are very pleased with this
agreement.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Briefly, this is a two stage transaction that
will begin initially with us providing a $2 million bridge loan
to Zynaxis.  Final closing is expected by early April with a vote
by Zynaxis shareholders.  CytRx will then provide  $4 million
dollars in equity which includes the conversion of the bridge
loan.  Vaxcel will be the surviving company and Zynaxis shareholders
will receive 12 1/2 percent of Vaxcel's shares.  I'm sure
there will be plenty of questions, so I'll hold further
remarks and ask Zynaxis' Chairman and CEO Martyn Greenacre
for his comments.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT>------------------------------------------------------------</FONT></B></CENTER>
<CENTER><I><B><FONT SIZE=3>Now, we
have very special news -- the actualization of one of CytRx's
primary strategic objectives. . .</FONT></B></I></CENTER>
<CENTER><B><FONT>------------------------------------------------</FONT></B></CENTER>
<BR>
</FONT></B></I></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT>Thanks Jack.  I'm glad to be able to talk to
all of you today. From the Zynaxis point of view this is a very
important transaction.  And, it is one that we are all very pleased
with.  Zynaxis has two significant technologies for the oral delivery
of vaccines --  PLG microspheres and mucoadhesive polymers.  But
we have lacked the necessary resources to fully develop them.
 So, through this merger with Vaxcel we believe we will be able
to realize the full potential of these technologies.  I would
like to have Paul Wilson, Vaxcel's President, describe
our technologies and how they fit with Vaxcel's.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Thank you, Martin.  With  this merger we are
creating an exciting company.  The past couple of years we have
been making good progress developing  Vaxcel's Optivax&#174;
technology.  Optivax is primarily focused on improving the effectiveness
of  injectable vaccines.  Our Phase I human clinical trial has
shown excellent interim results and should be completed during
the first quarter of next year.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT>------------------------------------------------------------</FONT></B></CENTER>
<CENTER><I><B><FONT SIZE=3>We are creating
a company with multiple vaccine delivery technologies.</FONT></B></I></CENTER>
<CENTER><B><FONT>-------------------------------------------------</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT>We will now be complementing this technology
with Zynaxis' oral technologies.  If you look at the vast
array of vaccines now being developed, there is no question that
certain of those vaccines are going to be more effective when
delivered by the injectable route and others more effective when
given orally.  Also, immunologists are now exploring combining
initial injectable doses with follow-on oral doses to optimize
effectiveness.  So, we are creating a company with multiple vaccine
delivery technologies.  This will increase our opportunities for
corporate collaborations with major vaccine companies.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT>------------------------------------------------------------</FONT></B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B><I><FONT SIZE=3>The combined company will be stronger by far than either company alone.</FONT></B></I></CENTER>
<CENTER><B><FONT>-------------------------------------------------</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT>As part of this merger, we will assume Zynaxis'
licensing agreement with ALK -- the world leader in allergy immunotherapeutic
products.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>So, our good data on Optivax, combined with
the opportunity to create new oral vaccines and the licensing
deal with ALK makes for quite an exciting company.  The new
Vaxcel will be ideally positioned to improve the effectiveness
of a variety of vaccines. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Now I will turn this over to your questions.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT>How should we evaluate this
merger from a market perspective?<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>Upon closing, Vaxcel will be the surviving
company.  CytRx will be putting $4 million into Zynaxis, which
will be merged into Vaxcel.  Zynaxis has about 14 million shares
(including convertible preferred stock).  Their closing price
of 28 puts about a $4 million value on the current Zynaxis shares.
 That portion  will represent 1/8 of the combined company, giving
the entire transaction a value of $32 million.  Now let's
put that into perspective.  A $32 million value for this company
with multiple attractive technologies compares very favorably
to three already public companies -- Virus Institute, Oravax and
Ribi.  The market values of these three companies are <U>each</U>
around $60 million.  So there's plenty of room for share
price growth here.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>What do you expect re: burn
rate and future cash needs?<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>The $4 million that CytRx is contributing will
remain in the company, with some to be used towards closing down
Zynaxis operations and settlement of some liabilities.  Vaxcel
is at the point where it's expected to start receiving revenues
as it enters into licenses with vaccine companies.  We don't expect
Vaxcel's burn to be high -- and the Zynaxis burn is eliminated.
 Next year's burn, even without any licensing revenues,
is about $2 million.  With expected licensing income,  we're
pretty comfortable with the cash situation.  Also, Zynaxis is
disposing a drug delivery technology which should bring in about
$500,000 as well as its Cauldron process chemistry group and pilot
chemical plant for which they are currently seeking buyers.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>When do you expect to begin
receiving licensing revenue?<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>Vaxcel's strategic intent is to complete
the Phase I human clinical trial and then begin aggressive licensing
efforts.  This will ensure that we get good valuations in licensing
deals.  We are on track to have the trial results in the first
quarter, and from there we'll be working aggressively to
put licenses in place.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>How are we doing with RheothRx,
and what is the status at this point<B>?<BR>
</B></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>We are doing very well with RheothRx.  It is
proceeding according to plan.  This year we introduced our purified
version of RheothRx to the FDA.  We have developed the compound,
manufactured it under GMP conditions and after several discussions
with the FDA, we will be going back into the clinic in the first
quarter of next year.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>We'll be starting with two dose escalation
studies.  The first set will be in patients suffering the painful
crisis of sickle cell disease.  The second set of patients will
also be sickle cell patients, but they will be the more serious
patients with acute chest syndrome.  Once the painful crisis study
is complete, it's our intention to go into a pivotal trial --
probably about 6 months after we begin the first trial.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>How many patients do you expect
to enroll in the trial?<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>The patient population will be around 300.
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>What is your game plan for
going after other applications such as stroke or heart attack?
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>Our focus now is on the sickle cell patient.
 We are not planning to do any heart attack studies in patients
in 1997.  We will be doing some additional preclinical studies
to show that the timing of administering RheothRx and tPa is a
critical factor in efficacy.  We want to complete that study before
we do any additional work in heart attack patients.  If we move
on to heart attack or stroke, or other large claims, most likely
 we will bring in corporate partners to assist in development
as well as in funding. I think RheothRx<I><SUB>pf </SUB></I>is
more attractive than ever, but first we want to get our purified
compound in the clinic and focus on getting it moving toward an
approval.  Corporate partners are going to want to see the purified
compound in the clinic.  We want to clean up everything, and put
our best foot forward before we begin conversations with them.
So, those conversations will probably start in the fourth quarter
of 1997.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>Do you feel Vetlife will sell
about $10 - $11 next year?<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>I think your numbers are within range.  We're
not projecting sales right now, but I am confident you will be
very pleased with what you see with Vetlife.  Since October, Vetlife's
sales force and technical service people have been doing a terrific
job introducing Elanco's Compudose.  We are very excited
about adding the full line of Ivy products in 1997.  It's going
to be a terrific year for Vetlife.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>When might we expect a public
offering on Vetlife? Is it within the next year?<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>It is certainly do-able within the next year.
 Vetlife has an attractive story with an excellent management
team.  The numbers are compelling, so it's something we look forward
to doing -- but no sooner than the second half of 1997 or possibly
1998.  We'll do it at the right time. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>Is the Cauldron division of
Zynaxis similar to Proceutics?<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>There are similarities.  However, there is
a location difference, and some of the services are different.
 We want to keep Proceutics focused on what they do best, and
have the Cauldron facility do what it does best.  When we find
the right buyer for Cauldron we'll sell it and provide that cash
to Vaxcel.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>I noticed that Zynaxis 1995
cash burn was quite high.  Is that being eliminated?<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>Yes.  The one piece that remains is the technology
development for the oral technology.  Zynaxis has already significantly
reduced its staffing and expenses.  Operations are intended to
be closed down by the time of the shareholder vote.  Once the
Cauldron division is sold and the lease assumed by the new owner,
the Zynaxis burn should be eliminated. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>After Vaxcel has completed
this merger, is there a plan to spinout any shares to CytRx holders?
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>It is not our intention to spinout Vaxcel shares
to CytRx shareholders. We plan to hold those shares, and use them
to build the CytRx business over time. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>Please comment on the overall
cash position and future cash burn rate of CytRx and it's subsidiaries.
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>Number one, our cash position is well under
control.  We will end the year with about $17 million in cash.
 We are projecting both Vetlife and Proceutics to be profitable
in 1997.  Also, we expect a much smaller loss for Vaxcel in 1997
with licensing revenues. CytRx will be spending more because of
the RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I> restart.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>I am pleased that our consolidated burn rate
is going down -- not up.  In 1995 we showed an operating loss
of $10 million.  In 1996, we will probably show an operating loss
around $5 million.  And in 1997, we're projecting an operating
loss that's around $3 million.  So were not concerned about cash.
 And with the prospect   of  our  subsidiaries   going  public,
there is always the possibility of selling
some of our subsidiary shares on the market.  But it's not something
we are anticipating and we don't see any fund raising efforts
necessary for CytRx.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>You have actively been buying
CytRx shares in the market.  Is there room to buy more shares?
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>Over the past year, we have purchased over
5 percent of our shares.  Recently we have not been able to buy
because of this transaction. I'm authorized to buy  five million
dollars worth of stock, and to date, we've bought just under two
million.  <BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>In closing,  I am very comfortable moving into
1997.  There are many great things happening.  This merger is
the best thing that could have happened to both Zynaxis and Vaxcel.
 The combined company will be stronger by far then either company
alone.  Vetlife is going to show us what it can do in 1997.  We
are all very excited about the restart of RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>.
  It is now a better product and it will be great to get it back
into the clinic.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>---------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>We have made several forward looking
statements in today's conference call.  Please keep in
mind all these depend on many factors that we do not control.
What we plan to do is one thing and how regulatory agencies react
is sometimes another.  Also there are obvious risks from trial
outcomes -- but in this business we take risks.  What we plan
to do is manage well that which we can manage and be prepared
to act decisively when necessary.</FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Good morning.  For those of you who are new to CytRx,
our mission is to develop and market high value human pharmaceutical
products. Our lead product is RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>, a
compound that shows promise in a variety of vaso-occlusive disorders.
 We plan to begin advanced human clinical trials in sickle cell
anemia patients during the first quarter of 1997. <B>RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I></B>
 is a purified version of RheothRx that we originally licensed
to Burroughs Wellcome (now Glaxo Wellcome).  Earlier this year
we regained all rights to the product and have purified and improved
it.  Recently, we were awarded a composition of matter
patent on RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>  which provides us long
patent protection in the market place. 
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A lot of activity is taking place on RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>.
 We have met with the FDA on our proposed program. They were very
supportive and we have since sent them a development proposal
and we expect them to respond in the next several weeks. We have
a clinical  investigator meeting planned for later this year.
We have raw material being produced and will soon be manufacturing
clinical supplies to have them ready to go by 1997.  In addition
we are beginning a number of pre-clinical studies to support the
sickle cell clinical activity as well as other future indications.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Sickle cell is an attractive initial target market
for CytRx.  Its global market size has been estimated to be between
$25 - $100 million. There is a very clear medical need.  Sickle
cell patients are subject to very painful crises.  On average,
patients require hospitalization about two times a year.  It's
a very expensive treatment with painful crisis costing about $6,000
per hospital stay and treatment cycle. It is also very damaging
to the patients organ systems which is why, on average, their
life expectancy is about 20 to 25 years shorter than otherwise
healthy people.  It is a debilitating disease for which there
is no real treatment.  We expect RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>
to be the first treatment for the episode of the crisis itself.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is important to note that already we have one
efficacy study that has been completed with very good results.
This is why we are encouraged to do additional studies in sickle
cell anemia.  Our future plans for RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>
 are to expand the clinical program beyond sickle cell and move
into much larger indications that are much more attractive in
general.  We would also like to partner this product on an international
basis. So we are excited about RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I> and
are looking forward to beginning advanced human clinical trials
next year. <BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>------------------------</FONT></B></CENTER>
<CENTER><I><B>It is our plan to take each subsidiary public.</B></I></CENTER>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>------------------------<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>At this point I would like to talk about our subsidiaries.
 As you know, CytRx has a unique structure.  We are a human pharmaceutical
company but also have three wholly-owned subsidiaries. The reason
for these subsidiaries is that we have a great deal of technology
that didn't totally fit into our human strategy.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We felt it was appropriate to bring in people that
were experts in these areas and build companies around these technologies.
 Vetlife is an animal health products company, Vaxcel is a vaccine
delivery company and Proceutics is a pharmaceutical services company.
 I'll speak to each one separately.
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Vetlife's</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2> mission is to
improve the productivity of food animals for human consumption.
 They have a very interesting business plan in that they have
both short and long term opportunities. Beginning in January 1997,
Vetlife will be marketing a line of cattle growth implants.  These
products are, for the most part, already approved as Vetlife has
taken the distribution rights away from Upjohn.  The cattle growth
implant market is centered on the feedlot with approximately $100
million in annual sales.  We estimate 1997 Vetlife sales to be
in the $8 - $10 million range which will generate $1 - $2 million
in profits.  So I think it's particularly interesting that we
have a company that will be showing sales <U>and</U> profit next
year.  Also, Vetlife has licensed CytRx technologies for animal
health use.  They have several opportunities in the area of feed
efficiency for growth promotion in poultry and swine.  They also
have technology for vaccine adjuvants and anti-infective technology
for animal health use.  These are longer term opportunities. Vetlife
management's plan is to develop these to a point where corporate
partners will be interested, then license them in return for license
fees, milestone payments and future royalties on sales.  So, Vetlife
looks like a very attractive opportunity for 1997 and beyond.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is our plan to take each subsidiary public at
some point in time. They were set up as wholly-owned subsidiaries
with the intent in mind of taking them public.  And each one of
these subsidiaries is led by management that really understands
their business. In the case of Vetlife, Rich Shuler was the former
Vice President of the Syntex animal health division. He's a very
seasoned and savvy executive. He has been in the animal health
business his entire career, and we have the utmost confidence
in his ability to run this business. He will also do a very great
job in launching an IPO for this company.
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Vaxcel</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2> is our second subsidiary.
This is a vaccine delivery company with a focused and simple business
strategy. Vaxcel has a technology that enhances the effectiveness
of vaccines. They plan to provide this technology to vaccine producers
to improve their vaccines -- whether they be new or old vaccines.
They are currently in a Phase I human clinical safety study which
should be complete by year-end. This a key study because most
potential licensing partners want to make sure that Vaxcel's
adjuvant material is safe, and so far the study is meeting expectations.
They already have two option agreements, one with Medeva (a UK
company) and Connaught. Additionally, they have a license agreement
with Corixa which is a biopharmaceutical start-up company working
on cancer vaccines.  Vaxcel management is in discussions with
just about every major vaccine player, so we expect more licenses
to come based on the performance of this technology.  Just like
Vetlife, Vaxcel will be planning an IPO and we hope that some
time in 1997 or 1998 that those IPO's will take place. Vaxcel
is headed by Paul Wilson who is the former Vice President and
general manager of American<B> </B>Cyanamid's<B> </B>Lederle-Praxis
vaccine division.  Paul's business skills are complemented
by Dr. Mark Newman who is one of the leading scientists in the
area of adjuvant technology.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Finally, our newest subsidiary is <B>Proceutics</B>,
which began operations this past January.  Proceutics provides
pre-clinical pharmaceutical development services such as analytical
chemistry, chemical synthesis and formulations.  These services
are useful to large pharmaceutical companies looking to outsource
projects during peak work periods or downsizing situations, generic
companies planning to file ANDA's and small development
companies that do not have the capital to hire the people and
build the facilities to do the technical work required to develop
drugs. Proceutics is enjoying increasing sales revenue each quarter
and is now seeing a consistent level of repeat business, which
is where your measure really is.  They are looking forward to
a profitable 1997 with revenues in the $3 - $4 million range vs.
revenues of about $2 - $2 1/2 million this year.  So Proceutics
is on the right track.  It is currently our intention for Proceutics
to go public sometime in 1998. 
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>When these milestones have been achieved, CytRx will
enjoy having three publicly-traded subsidiaries with CytRx owning
a substantial equity stake in each one.  This will provide a great
deal of flexibility in raising additional cash if needed, and
also in doing future mergers and acquisitions to build our core
human therapeutic business. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>------------------------</FONT></B></CENTER>
<CENTER><I><B>We have about a $2 million value being placed on
our businesses and technologies<BR> which is extremely low.</B></I></CENTER>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>------------------------<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Just to give you a brief financial picture, CytRx
and its subsidiaries have cash of approximately $21 million, and
physical assets of $8 million. We have no debt, so we have a net
asset value of about $29 million. Compare that with our current
market capitalization which stands at around $31 million (7.8
million shares outstanding at about $4 per share).  We therefore
have about a $2 million value being placed on our businesses and
technologies which is extremely low.  As far as our operating
performance goes, 1995 total revenues were $2.25 million, we estimate
 $4 - $5 million for 1996, and looking toward 1997 we are projecting
around $13 - $18 million largely due to the January 1997 launch
of Vetlife's cattle implant line.  Our cash burn for 1995
was about $10 million. This will be reduced in 1996 to $4 - $5
million and looking toward 1997 we are looking at $3 million -
and possibly break even.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>-------------------------------------------------------------</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>Q &amp; A SESSION<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Q. <B>Please tell us more about the new and improved
RheothRx.<BR>
</B></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A. RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I> is a purified version
of the commercial grade of RheothRx that was used in earlier clinical
trials.  What was seen in the earlier trials was that in very
high doses in certain patients (over 75 years old with a history
of kidney dysfunction) there were reports of elevated levels of
creatinine which is a marker of kidney function - indicating
a potential problem.  When dosage levels were reduced, the commercial
grade RheothRx did not demonstrate sufficient efficacy.  That
is why Glaxo Wellcome discontinued the trials and returned full
rights to us.  Our scientists analyzed the problem and found minute
quantities of an impurity in the commercial grade compound.  We
felt that if we took this impurity out we could have greater dosing
flexibility.  We then developed chemistry methods to extract it.
 We are confident that purified RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I> will
allow us to dose at required levels without incurring this kidney
concern seen with the commercial compound.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Q. <B>Will you develop this on your own or are
you going to look for a partner?<BR>
</B></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A. Our current plan is to take RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>
into the clinic on our own and get it approved for sickle cell
crisis.  We believe this is the fastest way to get it approved
in the United States. At the same time we will be talking with
corporate partners to develop and commercialize larger indications
such as heart attack and stroke.  Our plan is to market RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>
directly to the sickle cell community which is a very concentrated
market. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Q. What do you think the cost will be<B> to bring
this product through the trials?<BR>
</B></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A. We estimate development costs to be between $6
- $8 million.  I am very comfortable with the fact that we have
enough cash to do that.  Our business is financially under control
and our subsidiaries are no longer requiring the cash investment
that they have in the past so we are comfortable making this investment.
 I also hope that as we develop RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>,
we will establish corporate partner relationships that will generate
license fees and milestone payments to offset and perhaps exceed
the development cost for the sickle cell claim.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Q. In terms of clinical trials does that refer
to <B>Phase II or Phase III?<BR>
</B></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A.  Getting a drug approved requires several phases
of human clinical trails. Phase I trials are to establish drug
safety. Phase II is for dose ranging in patients with the disease
to determine optimal dosing.  Phase III is the pivotal clinical
study and is what approval is based on.  Given the excellent results
of a Phase II trial concluded in 1995, our plans are to convince
the FDA to allow us to directly proceed with a Phase III pivotal
trial in 1997 which would put us on track to file an NDA sometime
in 1999.  We are anxious to get going on this.  There is a great
deal of data compiled on this drug, and we are pursuing an Orphan
Drug indication for a disease that has no effective therapy. We
are currently planning a trial that will take about a year and
a half to complete. It really depends on the final discussions
with the FDA, on how many sites are involved and on the enrollment
rate at the sites.  But, if all goes according to plan, we will
finish the study in mid-1998.  Then, assuming the study achieves
everything we want, we will begin preparing our NDA for submission.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Q. Does the orphan drug status designation that
was given to you by the FDA <B>help?<BR>
</B></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A. Yes, the orphan drug designation puts us in the
FDA's 1-A priority category.  The FDA is
required by law to give it a fast review which doesn't mean it's
going to get a fast approval.  But, if your NDA is prepared properly,
the data is well supported and they quickly review it -- this
should lead to faster approval which is generally the case with
orphan drugs.  You also get some tax advantages that are not as
important to us and you also get seven years market exclusivity
which frankly we don't need because it overlaps our patents. 
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Q. <B>What is your confidence level after your
talks with the FDA?<BR>
</B></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A. We had one good meeting with the FDA.  They were
receptive to us taking RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I> back into
the clinic for sickle cell.  It was a very constructive meeting,
and was encouraging for me. They made some comments and suggestions
and we have just recently communicated back to them with precisely
what we'd like to do. It will be several weeks before they respond.
That's just the nature of the agency.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Q.<B> From your dialogue do you have a pretty
good confidence level they will allow you to use previous data,
you're not going to have to start from ground zero?<BR>
</B></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A. We have no indication so far that leads us to
believe that this is going to be treated as a new compound.  In
fact, that was the main purpose of the first meeting - to have
a good understanding between CytRx an the FDA that this is not
a new compound. One of the consultants we worked with had a great
quotation. He said it's better, not different.
 In this business, pharmaceutical companies are always purifying
their compounds all the way until they get to Phase III, so this
would not be an unusual situation where you remove an impurity
before you go into a Phase III trial. That is precisely what we
have done. We haven't changed the structure of the compound. 
When you characterize it, it has the same profile as the other
one except we've eliminated impurities that we've determined provide
no benefit, and in fact, appear to cause a problem at very high
doses.  By eliminating the impurities, we improve the compound,
and make it better, not different.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Q. <B>What leads you to feel it is better?<BR>
</B></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A. What makes it better is that it's a more purified
compound that we believe we can dose at higher levels without
running into the same level of renal dysfunction we saw in the
earlier trial.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We did a study in a very carefully controlled rat
model that took us months and months to do. We tested three groups.
 One was the commercial grade of RheothRx, the second was the
purified version, and the third is what we called the extract
-- what we removed in the purification process.  The rats in this
study had only about <U>one-sixth</U> of their normal kidney function
to begin with and then they were given <U>five</U> times the clinical
dose.  The purpose of this study was to see how a severely compromised
kidney would react to a high dosage of RheothRx.  As you can see,
the study was intentionally designed to find problems.  What we
found is that the commercial grade group had a very high mortality
rate and the purified group had a very low mortality rate. Since
the extract amount is so small, the extract group was actually
given a special mixture that contained approximately
ten times the normal level of impurities.  This group had about
an 82% mortality and the feeling was that if we gave them the
pure extract we would have killed all the animals within an hour.
 So we're very confident that we've removed the problem.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Q. If all your dreams were to come true where
would we be at this time next year?<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A. By this time next year I would like to see RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>
well into an acute sickle cell crisis human clinical trial. I
would like to have initiated a study in acute chest syndrome as
well. I would like to see two excellent sales quarters from Vetlife
that will firmly establish its value to our shareholders.  I would
also like to see two corporate deals completed by Vaxcel and Proceutics
turning a profit.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Q. How about you<B>r stock buy-back program?<BR>
</B></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A. We did not do a lot of buying in the first and
second quarter.  Since we have not made a disclosure, all I can
tell you today is that we have clearly been more active in the
third quarter.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Q. You mentioned that Vaxcel has been talking
with many major vaccine companies.  Are any
negotiations going on with CytRx or other subsidiaries?<BR>
</B></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A. There are, but I can't discuss those until they
are concluded.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Q. What would be the earliest that the first subsidiary
could be brought public, and how much of the subsidiary would
you sell?<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A. I'll answer the second question first.  I would
like to limit our equity sales to no more than 20% of each company.
 We haven't decided which will be first.  That will depend on
market conditions and subsidiary achievements.  I would like to
see one company go public around mid-1997 if the market is cooperative.
 I think Vaxcel or Vetlife will be the best candidates. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Q.<B>  Where would you like CytRx stock to be
when you take a subsidiary public?<BR>
</B></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A. I would like CytRx with a market cap of no less
than a $100 million which is about $13 a share. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Q. What catalysts <B>do you think are necessary
to take it there?<BR>
</B></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A. I think getting RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I> back
into the clinic will be key.  Most people have totally discounted
RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>, and, once it's back in human clinical
trials, people will start paying a lot of attention to it.  I
also think a greater awareness of the value of our subsidiaries
is another important element.  Seeing substantial first quarter
sales by Vetlife and licensing deals by Vaxcel should get people
to take notice and start paying attention to these as truly valuable
subsidiaries.  Then, we have to do an excellent job simply communicating
our story and getting in front of people so they can fully understand
it. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Q. How about Protox?<BR>
</FONT></B>
<FONT SIZE=2>A. Given the emphasis we are placing on RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>,
we have de-emphasized our activities in Protox.  The FDA has given
us the go ahead to commence Phase I trials but at this point we
are concentrating all our energy and people and financial resources
on RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I> which is where the most opportunity
is for our shareholders. It's a focus issue, pure and simple.
 It takes a lot of time and energy to move a drug through its
development.  Right now, I want to focus totally on RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>.
That's where we can get the biggest bang for our buck.</FONT>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>I would like to point out that today we have made
several forward looking statements.  Please keep
in mind all these depend on many factors such as FDA reviews that
we do not control. What we plan to do is one thing and how the
regulatory agencies react is sometimes another.  Also there are
the obvious risks from trial outcomes -- but in this business
we take risks.  What we plan to do is manage well that which we
can manage and be prepared to act decisively when necessary.<BR>

<h1>Q & A's Excerpted From 2/6/96 Conference Call</h1>

<b>
Opening Remarks by Jack J. Luchese</b>
<P>
Good morning.  Over the past week we had the pleasure of making two important announcements.  One was the start of Phase I clinical trials for Vaxcels Optivax  vaccine delivery system.  The second was the signing of Vetlifes deal with Ivy Laboratories to market cattle growth promotants.
<P>
Our plan is to have a series of conference calls like this supplemented by visits to our major investors and broker networks throughout 1996.  We will be including individual subsidiary presidents on these investor updates to give you the opportunity to become better acquainted with our subs and their leadership.
<P>
With that said, I would like to turn this over to Rich Shuler, Vetlifes president and CEO to review the Vetlife / Ivy agreement and respond to your questions about Vetlife.  Then, Ill be happy to answer your questions on CytRx in general.

<P>

<b>Richard Shuler (RS)</b> 


Thanks, Jack.  I thank all of you for your interest in joining us this morning.  You may not be familiar with Vetlife -- Ive been here about a year and a half.  I came here as President and CEO to develop and commercialize technologies that were part of the CytRx family.  I also came here with a vision to build a viable animal health company.  Last week we took the first major step towards realizing that vision.
<P>
Before I joined Vetlife, I was responsible for Syntexs North American Animal Health Products company.  We became the dominant market share leader in cattle products, particularly in growth promotants.  One of the companies that I competed successfully against was a generic producer named Ivy Laboratories. I became acquainted with their owner and we built a mutual respect for each other, though I must say we really were his nemesis! 
<P>
Last fall, Ivy decided to end their distribution relationship with Upjohn.  Their owner contacted me to see if I would be interested in joining him to grow his business.  I am pleased to report that the results of my  discussions with him is a 10-year agreement to market and distribute Ivys line of cattle growth promotant products.
<P>
Vetlifes agreement with Ivy has three significant elements.  First, on January 1, 1997, we will take over Ivys current line of growth promotant products for the US and Canada.  Second, Ivy has applications pending with the FDA for new generic growth promotant products which we will market as soon as they are approved.  And third, we have rights to other technologies that Ivy will develop for the North American market.
<P> 
I am confident that Vetlifes Cattle Marketing Group will be successful.  Heres why:
<P>
You may be aware that since I left Syntex, they were bought by Roche who subsequently sold much of the animal health business to American Home Products.  My key Syntex team members elected not to join American Home and are available and excited about joining Vetlifes new venture.  We have done this before and our template is successful. 
<p>
We will be beginning with a proven team that is highly respected.  At Syntex, we were ranked number one in large cattle customer service in the US for five consecutive years.  My team has a track record of successfully differentiating products to build market share.
<p>
At Syntex we relied heavily on distributors.  We built a high trust bond with them.  In the US, three distributors -- all of whom are personal friends -- generate about 85% of the sales for this $100 million market.  We also worked closely with the cattle producers.  There has been consolidation in the beef industry, just like weve seen in other industries, and 25 corporate organizations now feed about 40% of the beef we eat.  We just met with them all in San Antonio, and theyre pleased my team is back in this business because we have a reputation for adding valuable services that differentiate us from the others. 
<p>
This agreement is an excellent fit with Vetlifes other technologies currently in development.  We have a non-antibiotic growth promotant that were in the process of licensing out.  Second, we have two other classes of compounds that were evaluating.  One is for adjuvants to improve vaccines -- something that  is desperately needed in the food animal industry.  The other is for potentiators to improve the performance of anti-microbials.  The Vetlife Cattle Marketing Group will provide us with the brand name and awareness that will enable us to market direct in North America should these technologies prove efficacious and safe.
<p>
The bottom line is that Im excited about having a presence in the beef market no later than January 1.  We will be generating sales, profits and cash flow from the sale of established products.  And, I am excited about the potential of other growth promotant products that Ivy has in development. 
<p> 
<b>
Rich, What did you accomplish at the Cattle Show in San Antonio?  </b><p>

RS - We wanted to establish three things.  One was to let the producers know we will be back in the business, and that the services and value we established at Syntex will be there again.  Second, along with Ivy, we met with the three privately owned distributors who control 85% of our target segment, so that they were aware of our strategies and would continue to be supportive of us at launch.  Im pleased that all three gave excellent feedback, and we can expect a high level of cooperation from them.  The third was to conduct customer input sessions to explore and test novel differentiation strategies.
<P>
<b>When do you plan to sell your products nationwide?
</b> 

<p>  

RS - We will sell nationwide from the start.
<p>
<b>Please give us some kind of feel of what youd expect to do in this $100 million dollar marketplace in the first year or two.</b><p>

RS - We anticipate sales in the $6-$8 million dollar range with the current products that are already approved for marketing.  New products, when approved, will be in a family of products that have an average selling price about three times higher than the current line.  Assuming FDA approvals of these new products, these could add $4 to $6 million to our sales.
<p>
<b>Are you going to be bringing more people in-house, or are you going to do a "virtual" organization for this?</b><p>

RS - We plan a hybrid.  Were already lean and mean, and because of the consolidation of this industry, we dont need a large organization.  But well be heavy into technical services to provide added value to our line of products.  Weve already hired one of my former tech service managers.  And also, my former Global Business Unit Manager, joined me on Monday.  Were in the process now of slowly firing up so by December, well have a full complement of top quality former Syntex tech services professionals, backed by a small group of operations people.  Were going to maintain a lean presence because of two things -- a heavy reliance on distributors, and a consolidating industry that doesnt require large sales organizations to reach the growth promotant market.
<p>
<b>Will you have to carry large inventories to supply your customers?</b><p>


RS - These are long-dated products and our distributors are willing to carry full lot runs. Its pretty much a year-round market.  Well rely on the major distributors to maintain large levels of inventory and sell direct to market and to smaller distributors.

<b>Remarks by Jack J. Luchese </b><p>

Id like to give you an overall recap of CytRx and where we are today.  Keep in mind, when you buy CytRx shares, youre essentially buying four distinct business units.  Youre buying Vetlife, which needless to say, were very excited about.  Rich Shuler is a first-rate, first-class executive -- and a proven leader.  He is well-respected in this industry and has received a number of honors by the cattlemen.  With CytRx, the second business unit you buy is Vaxcel.  Vaxcels strategy is really developing in 1996 as they have entered Phase I human trials with their Optivax  vaccine delivery system. This is the first time Optivax has been in man, and were excited about that.  Youll hear more about that in a couple of weeks when we plan to have a conference call with Paul Wilson, Vaxcels president.  Also, we own Proceutics, which is a pharmaceutical development services company.  This is a cash business, and we expect it to generate cash flow for CytRx.  And, finally you have CytRxs human therapeutics portfolio of which RheothRx is the most important.  Theres a new story on RheothRx, that youll be hearing more about over the next several months.  
<p>
I want to also recap some important issues.  After the reverse split, we now have about 7.9 million shares outstanding.  We are currently selling at a market capitalization of approximately $36 million dollars.  Since we have cash and fixed assets of $31 million dollars, the market is assigning a technology value of only $5 million dollars.  That is incredibly low -- I think we are one of the most under-valued stocks in the market today, and I think CytRx is a great buy for 1996, and the story will develop very nicely throughout 1997.  
<p>
Looking ahead to 1997,  we are comfortable saying that CytRx  (including subsidiaries) will generate $10 million in sales from our various businesses.  So were putting our financial house in order, and were building a lot of sustainable value for our shareholders.
<p>
Ill be happy to respond to your questions about CytRx
<p>
<b>Id like to follow-up on a series of comments that were made immediately following the adverse RheothRx announcement back in October.  At that time, I believe it was stated by the company that upon receipt of all of the documentation, you would review those materials and see if there was anything further that could be pursued with regard to RheothRx.  What has been the progress so far?</b><p>

About three weeks ago, we received a copy of the 11,000 page IND document from Glaxo Wellcome.  Were poring through that as it contains a lot of good information. The next milestone is when Glaxo Wellcome files its annual report to the FDA.  Once they file the annual report, they will officially transfer the IND to CytRx.  That is important as CytRx is not permitted to speak directly with the FDA about RheothRx until we have control of the IND. 
<p>
We are looking at the potential of a purified form of RheothRx for an orphan indication sickle cell crisis.  We have not made a firm decision to proceed.  We plan to meet with the FDA and assess their attitude towards that possibility.  Then we will make a business decision as to whether we will continue with RheothRx.  I expect that decision to be made sometime in the middle of the year.
<p>
<b>Do you have any time frame for how long the Optivax Phase I study will take?</b><p>

This Phase I study is expected to take most of 1996.  It is a dose escalating study to determine maximum tolerated doses.  You start lower, and go progressively higher with different patient groups.  The current protocol requires completion of each lower group before starting a higher dose group.  Its possible that could be accelerated, but I wouldnt want to speculate on that right now.
<p>
Thank you for your time and your questions. We appreciate your interest in CytRx and look forward to talking to you again in a couple of weeks.

<B>VAXCEL ANNOUNCES INITIATION OF OPTIVAX&reg;<B>
HUMAN CLINICAL TRIAL<BR>
</B></B>
<P>
<B>Atlanta, Georgia, (January 30, 1996) <BR>
</B>
<P>
Vaxcel, Inc. today announced the initiation
of a Phase I human clinical trial of Optivax&reg; at a comprehensive
cancer center. This trial is the first time Vaxcel's Optivax
vaccine adjuvant has been tested in humans.

<P>
Optivax is Vaxcel's proprietary vaccine
delivery and adjuvant system that is based on synthetic copolymers.
In preclinical studies, Optivax has been shown to improve the
effectiveness of a variety of different vaccines. This Phase I
clinical trial is being conducted to evaluate the safety and activity
of Optivax administered in combination with a  human chorionic
gonadotropin (hCG) based vaccine in patients with metastatic cancer.
The trial will be performed using escalating doses of Optivax
to determine the optimal human dose. The hCG vaccine for the trial
is being supplied by ImmunoTherapy Corporation of Tustin, California.

<P>
To date, we have documented the safety
and effectiveness of the Optivax adjuvant in preclinical evaluations,
commented Dr. Mark Newman, Vaxcel's Vice President of Research
and Development. We expect this Phase I clinical trial
will confirm these results in humans.

<P>
Vaxcel is engaged in the development and commercialization
of the Optivax System and offers field-of-use licenses to companies
developing new vaccines or improving existing ones. The company
currently has option agreements with Connaught Laboratories, Inc.
and Medeva PLC to evaluate and develop human vaccines using Optivax.
Vaxcel is a wholly owned subsidiary of CytRx Corporation (NASDAQ:
CYTR).

<P>
CytRx Corporation and its subsidiaries are
engaged in the development of pharmaceutical products. In addition
to Vaxcel, CytRx has two other subsidiaries. Vetlife is developing

<P>
<B>CYTRX ANNOUNCES SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL
OF REVERSE SPLIT
</B>
<P>
<B>Atlanta, Georgia, February 5, 1996<BR>
</B>
<P>
At a Special Meeting of CytRx Corporation,
[NASDAQ: CYTR] shareholders today overwhelmingly approved a one-for-four
reverse split of its common stock shares. 

<P>
With 90% of shares voted, more than 94% of
the ballots cast were in favor of the reverse split.

<P>
We are gratified by the response of
CytRx shareholders to the reverse split, commented Jack
J. Luchese, CytRx's President and CEO.  We strongly
feel this will better position CytRx and our subsidiaries in the
financial markets.

<P>
The reverse split will be effective on February
6, 1996.  As of that date, CytRx's outstanding shares will
decrease from approximately 31.4 million to 7.9 million.  CytRx
stock will trade under the symbol CYTRD for 20
trading days to indicate the new post-split status. CytRx's
transfer agent, American Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Co. will send
each shareholder of record a letter of transmittal along with
instructions for exchanging old CytRx stock certificates
for  new  post-split certificates.

<P>
Luchese continued, Our stock repurchase
program remains in force, which we will use to take advantage
of price weaknesses should the financial markets not appropriately
value CytRx stock after the reverse split.   In October,
1995, CytRx's Board authorized the repurchase of up to
5 million shares (1.25 million on a post-split basis).  As of
year-end, the company purchased 235,000 shares (59,000 post-split).


<P>
CytRx Corporation and its subsidiaries are
engaged in the development of pharmaceutical products.  CytRx's
Vaxcel subsidiary is developing the Optivax&#174; vaccine delivery
system.  Vetlife is developing solutions to enhance food animal
growth.  Proceutics provides high quality preclinical development
services to the pharmaceutical industry.
