N.Y. RESTRUCTURING RECOMMENDATION: ISO TO OVERSEE MOVE TO RETAIL ACCESS

Establishing an independent system operator to formalize wholesale
competition in New York and ensure transition to retail access is a key
part of restructuring the state's electric industry, according to a state
judge and a state regulator.
   The recommended decision in the state's Competitive Opportunities
proceeding also calls for separating transmission and distribution from
generation and for recovering stranded costs with an access charge imposed
by a distribution company (Doc. No. 95-E-0952).
   The recommendation was filed Dec. 22 by the state's Dept. of Public
Service Administrative Law Judge Judith Lee and Ronald Liberty, deputy
director for the Energy and Water Division. Subject to review by the Public
Service Commission, it aims to lower New York's high electricity rates and
keep industry in the state.
   No timetable for the ``as soon as possible'' transition to retail access
has been established, however, a PSC spokesperson told Northeast Power
Report.
   Key parts of the more than 200-page review are:
   -- Strandable costs ``may be made unrecoverable by the transition from
regulation to a competitive market for electricity.'' These costs could be
recovered by a separate mechanism outside the market, such as a
non-bypassable access charge or wires charge imposed by a distribution
company.
   -- Transmission and distribution should be separate from generation ``in
order to limit the exercise of market power,'' and T&D companies will need
to serve all would-be buyers in the short term.
   Lee said she saw as ``critical'' the reliability of the bulk power
system, noting that it should not be sacrificed in any way in order to
achieve the potential price reduction that may be associated with a system
of retail access. Therefore, ``effective competition at the wholesale level
should be established first, with an eye toward adding retail access as
rapidly as possible once a market is established and reliability is
ensured.''
   Lee's recommendation was a ``tremendous disappointment'' to New York
industrials ``and to any advocate of full and open retail competition,''
said Barbara Brenner, counsel to Multiple Intervenors, the industrial users
trade group. ``It delays, without schedule, retail competition and, in
fact, appears to delay even the implementation of wholesale competition for
two years,'' she said.
   Utilities, on the other hand, like the proposal. Their trade group, the
Energy Association of New York State, applauded the law judge's
recommendation as ``a thoughtful approach to what is clearly an incredibly
complex series of issues.''
   ``Wholesale competition to the extent that the Energy Association has
been talking about is far more significant than what might exist today in
New York--and in most other places,'' said Howard Shapiro, the
association's president.
   On the legislative front, New York Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver
(D-Manhattan) unveiled a proposal calling for an immediate freeze of
electric rates and setting a goal of cutting them by 25%.
   Further, under Silver's plan, utilities would be required to buy power
in a competitive wholesale market by September 1997. By September 2000,
``if conditions ensuring safety, reliability...and access to a reasonably
priced power are met,'' customers would be able to choose their own power
suppliers.
   Industrials reacted in similar fashion to Silver's proposal. ``We're
studying [it] carefully. We don't think it moves fast enough. We would like
to see retail competition by Jan. 1, 1997,'' Brenner said.
   The Energy Association's Shapiro said he was pleased that at least
Silver recognized that ``competition alone doesn't produce a dramatic
short-term reduction of rates and that other issues must be addressed.''
   Gov. George Pataki also weighed in on the issue in his Jan. 3 State of
the State address, calling restructuring ``a major sea change facing our
state and our nation,'' and citing the Long Island Power Authority's plan
to take over Long Island Lighting (NPR, 22 Dec '95, 1).

PSNH, CONNECTICUT VALLEY ELECTRIC SLAM N.H. PUC RULING ON UTILITY
FRANCHISES

   In a closely watched case, Public Service of New Hampshire and
Connecticut Valley Electric have filed detailed arguments to the New
Hampshire Supreme Court against a June 1995 Public Utilities Commission
determination that electric utilities in the state do not have exclusive
franchises.
   In a Dec. 18 filing in a case involving Freedom Energy's request to
compete against PSNH for retail customers (Doc. No. 95-610), PSNH charged
that a series of major state court opinions and legislative actions since
1911 had created a legal pattern ``incorporating the economic model of a
regulated monopoly in which service by a single provider was the essential
principle.''
   PSNH listed a long series of instances in which the state acted on the
assumption that exclusive utility franchises existed and said that the 1995
PUC decision against exclusive franchises ``in effect overlooked the forest
for the trees.''
   ``By insisting on a specific `tree' explicitly providing for exclusivity
in electric utility franchises,'' PSNH said, ``the PUC majority missed the
forest of authority'' that created an economic model based on exclusive
franchises.
   PSNH also said the court should dismiss PUC claims that the state
constitution guaranteed open competition in the electric utility sector.
   It said previous court decisions had recognized the unique nature of
electric service and the practical need for monopolies in the sector. The
creation of the PUC in 1911 to oversee such ``sanctioned monopolies'' was
in harmony with the other constitutional safeguards against monopolies.
   PSNH also invoked the state's ``administrative gloss'' doctrine, saying
that the PUC's consistent rulings in the past in favor of exclusive
franchises plus the legislature's failure to interfere with the
interpretation created a ``binding gloss'' which deprived the PUC of the
right to unilaterally change its policy now.
   It said this administrative gloss approach was needed because nothing in
state law explicitly authorized either competing franchises or exclusive
franchises. This ambiguity made the long-standing PUC interpretation of the
law the crucial element in determining current law.
   In a third major argument, PSNH said that the fact that the New
Hampshire legislature passed a detailed bill in June 1995 creating a
process to study ways to increase electric industry competition showed that
the PUC did not have authority to make decisions on the issue.
   It said that the authority given to the PUC in the bill to carry out a
retail wheeling pilot was restrictive and fell ``far short'' of the powers
claimed by the PUC to set policy.
   Instead, PSNH said, the message from the 1995 law was that ``the
legislature would set policy while the PUC would assault the legislature by
gathering relevant information through the pilot program.''
   In its filing to the state Supreme Court, CVE said that the PUC decision
on the franchise issue ``created an imbalance in the regulatory equation''
in the state. ``The PUC order revokes the utility's right to be the
exclusive supplier within its service territory, but does not relieve the
utility's corresponding obligation to serve all customers regardless of
economics.''
   CVE also noted that the legislature had a record of involvement in the
policy issues of utility franchise exclusivity and that unless it delegated
authority in this field to the PUC, the court should assume the power
itself.
   Representatives of the PUC and Freedom Energy are expected to file their
comments to the court in mid-January. The court will hear oral arguments in
the case in February (NPR, 10 Nov '95, 10).

GM PLANS 25-MW COGENERATION PROJECT AT N.J. PLANT, OWNED, OPERATED BY
QUIXX

   General Motors wants an outside party to install and operate a 25-MW
cogeneration system at its Linden, N.J., truck plant so it can cut costs
and focus on its manufacturing business.
   The project would be developed by Quixx Corp., a subsidiary of
Southwestern Public Service. Based in Amarillo, Tex., Quixx would own and
operate the plant, although GM said it may take an ownership stake. Most
power would be used in house, though some excess would occasionally be sold
to Public Service Electric & Gas, which now supplies the plant. PSE&G
charges industrials about 7.5 cents/kWh.
   GM has asked the N.J. Board of Public Utilities for an order declaring
that the project would not be regulated as a utility (Docket No.
EE95100486). This is a technicality that non-utility generators usually
seek in New Jersey, and GM pointed out that the plant would not supply
power or steam to other end users. However, the company is asking the BPU
for expedited treatment of the declaration, ``due to intense economic
pressures and the planning needs of GM Linden for a prompt go/no go
ruling.'' According to GM, the factory serves as its export plant for small
trucks and sport vehicles, a market ``which seems to gain new competitive
entrants each year.'' It expects that the cogeneration plant could be
brought on-line in 18-24 months.
   The factory was built in 1936, and it still uses the original thermal
plant to provide steam, heat and compressed air for vehicle production. GM
attorneys Potter & Dickson, Princeton, N.J., pointed out that the plant
employs 2,700 workers, and said, ``Without the [project], the long-term
viability of the Linden assembly plant remains jeopardized by competition
internal to General Motors and from competition by other producers of small
trucks and sport utility vehicles.'' Aside from the energy savings--which
were not disclosed--shutting down the old oil-fired boilers would reduce
emissions and compliance costs.
   Thomas Noble, manufacturing engineering manager, told the BPU that the
old energy plant will have to be replaced in the near future, and that such
an investment would detract from the plant's manufacturing business.
Instead, he said, ``installation of a new, state-of-the-art, on-site total
energy system, operated by a third party of experts, will enable GM Linden
plant managers and personnel to concentrate their time, attention and
investment decisions on GM's core business...''

MMWEC SEES TRANSMISSION, MARKET POWER ISSUES AS IMPEDIMENT TO NEPOOL
REFORM

   Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric, saying it was speaking for
consumer-owned utilities in New England, has warned the investor-owned
utilities in the region that no reform of the New England Power Pool system
will be possible without resolution of outstanding transmission and market
power issues.
   In comments presented to the NEPOOL executive committee, MMWEC said that
the ``NEPOOL Plus'' plan for revising pool operations proposed by Northeast
Utilities veered from the group's basic purpose of assuring reliability at
the lowest possible cost for all consumers (NPR, 8 Dec '95, 3).
   It said that while NU's ``piecemeal'' plan would introduce bidding for
dispatch, it would also ignore other key issues.
   MMWEC predicted the NU plan would ``ultimately fail'' unless it included
a comprehensive solution to all pool issues. It said that the NEPOOL
management committee, where all members were directly represented, should
debate the proposed changes, rather than the executive committee.
   MMWEC said the bid-based pooling system would not work unless there was
regional network service, under which all participants had equal access and
equal pricing.
   It said this could be done through contractual arrangements such as
those discussed in previous regional transmission group negotiations. Such
a system, run by a neutral entity, should eliminate unequal contract path
and pancake pricing problems while still compensating owners of
transmission for their investments, MMWEC said.
   A bid-based system, as proposed by NU, would not work well in a truly
competitive market, MMWEC said, because larger NEPOOL members would have
the ability to manipulate the system by controlling either a significant
amount of generation or specific functional resources, such as 10-minute,
non-spinning reserves.
   MMWEC said manipulative actions or improper responses to market signals
by large members ought to be prohibited. It said that this rule could be
policed by a neutral body which would hear complaints and levy sanctions.
   The muni group said that pool rules should be made in the interest of
the end user and that voting representation should remain limited to
members which serve retail load. This would avoid giving power inside the
group to players in the market which did not have a direct responsibility
toward retail customers.
   MMWEC said that any plan for bid-based dispatching must require
disclosure of spot market and bilateral deals, including price information
and availability of bids.
   It noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has already
raised questions about NEPOOL transmission rules, most recently rejecting a
plan to allow increased bilateral energy sales in the region because the
transmission implications had not been addressed.
   While the MMWEC proposals present a challenge to the large New England
utilities, they also contradict many points contained in the NEPOOL reform
plan proposed by the Competitive Power Coalition of New England which calls
for more rights in NEPOOL for non-utility members, the formation of an
independent system operator for transmission and a totally free market
approach to the pool.

NUG/MARKETER GROUP WANTS INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR TO REPLACE NEPOOL

   The debate over the future of the New England Power Pool heightened last
week when the Competitive Power Coalition of New England circulated a draft
proposal calling for replacing NEPOOL with an independent system operator
(ISO).
   Titled ``A Blueprint for a Competitive Electricity Supply System in New
England,'' the report said it offers ``an alternative to mere incremental
adjustments currently being proposed by NEPOOL incumbents.''
   The Boston-based advocacy group for independents and power marketers
dropped out of NEPOOL reform talks in October to pursue its own plan
because it believed the group was moving too slowly, according to John
Howat, CPC executive director. Northeast Utilities recently proposed a more
modest reform that introduces bidding for NEPOOL dispatch in a two-phase
process. Called ``NEPOOL Plus,'' that plan has won widespread support among
NEPOOL members, according to NU (NPR, 8 Dec '95, 3).
   CPC planned to meet this week with utilities to discuss its blueprint,
which it describes as ``evolutionary not revolutionary,'' keeping the
strong elements of NEPOOL and transforming them into an independent system
operator. For example, the ISO would probably maintain the same personnel
that are now employed by NEPOOL and use the same facilities.
   However, the ISO would coordinate transmission delivery based on
contracts between buyers and sellers, rather than NEPOOL's current economic
dispatch. A FERC-regulated network, it would have no corporate or business
link with utilities or other market participants and no members, governance
board or voting rules.
   To maintain system reliability, the ISO would control some generation,
procured through competitively secured contracts, or calls on generation
assets.
   The blueprint envisions an electric power system with six components:
supply, supply aggregation, system operation, load aggregation,
distribution and consumers.
   While delivery would be provided at regulated prices, supply would be
fully competitive, with energy service providers serving as the chief
interface with customers. The report envisioned many entities filing the
energy service provider role, including marketers, aggregators and utility
spin-offs.
   The energy service providers would contract with generating companies,
transmission companies and distribution companies to buy power and delivery
services that could then be packaged and resold to retail customers. Energy
service providers might also provide additional services, such as bundling
a power sale with metering and associated equipment services.
   The blueprint also gives customers the option of bypassing the energy
service provider and buying power directly from the wholesale market, an
approach more likely to be pursued by large customers than small
customers.
   CPC recommended that utilities unbundle generation, transmission and
distribution assets through divesture, a concept that some major New
England utilities have already rejected. CPC said it supports stranded
investment recovery and opposes forced contract re-negotiation between
independents and utilities, an approach pushed by some utilities to lower
stranded costs.
   ``Our members are willing to look at renegotiations where a
renegotiation would result in a mutually beneficial position,'' Howat said.
``A pressure for forced renegotiation is really not a good way to move
toward a system that is based on contracts. What does that say to the
financial community?''
   ``Clearly had prices gone up dramatically, instead of gone down, and had
demand for power risen dramatically, I don't think the entities that are
clamoring now for renegotiations of contracts would be singing that tune,''
he said.
   CPC expects to issue a final report in early January.

D.C. PSC OPENS COMPETITION PROCEEDING; SEEKS WRITTEN COMMENTS BY END OF
MARCH

   The District of Columbia Public Service Commission has opened a formal
proceeding on electric competition and is seeking written comments from
interested parties (Case No.945). Those will be due 90 days after the PSC
issues its order on the Dec. 15 pre-hearing conference, which is expected
early in the new year.
   In launching the case, the PSC cites open-access rules proposed by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last spring. Although these only apply
to wholesale transactions, ``the impact that the adoption of the rules
would have on retail electric sales should not be overlooked,'' the PSC
stated. Although electric rates from Potomac Electric Power are low for the
region--averaging 7.2 cents/kWh--the PSC ``recognizes that, if this fact is
to remain true, the commission must be prepared to take steps to allow a
greater reliance on competition and customer choice.''
   Further, ``increasing competition among sellers of electricity will
result in increasing choices for buyers,'' the PSC said. However, it could
also affect reliability, planning, economic development and the
environment. Allowing retail competition could also allow new suppliers to
lure away PEPCO's larger commercial customers, stranding fixed costs that
would fall on remaining ratepayers. Therefore, the PSC wants to explore
these issues before taking any steps to open the system.
   Among the questions that the PSC would like to address are: whether the
PSC should refrain from instituting retail wheeling until wholesale markets
develop; what impact retail wheeling would have on various classes of
ratepayers; what specific steps the PSC could take to encourage wholesale
and retail wheeling; and whether the commission should order PEPCO to
disaggregate generation, transmission and distribution.
   In addition, the PSC would like estimates on how much capacity would be
stranded, and how those costs should be allocated. It also seeks comments
on whether demand-side management and environmental programs should be
continued under competition, and how they would be funded. PEPCO said it
welcomes the investigation, though it noted that questions regarding the
role of the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection (PJM) must be
addressed by FERC.
   Comments should be addressed to the Commission Secretary at the District
of Columbia Public Service Commission, 450 Fifth St., N.W., Washington,
D.C., 20001. Correspondence should reference Case No. 945 and the title
``In the Matter of the Investigation into Electric Services, Market
Competition and Regulatory Policies.''

GREEN MOUNTAIN POWER RESTRUCTURING PLAN WOULD PUT GENERATION UP FOR BID

   Green Mountain Power has filed a restructuring plan with Vermont
regulators which proposes to use an auction system to determine the value
of stranded generation investments and power purchase commitments.
   The auction would not be a forced asset divestiture and the owner of the
generation assets being sold could bid against other groups to retain
them.
   The plan, filed with the Vermont Public Service Board Jan. 2 (Doc. No.
5854), would deregulate generation and the sale of electricity while
keeping transmission and distribution service under state regulation.
   Retail customers would be offered competitive options for power
supplies, one of which would be a ``basic electric service package,''
including regulated services from the franchise distribution company and
``lowest cost available'' power supplies.
   GMP said the division between regulated and competitive sectors would
let the marketplace establish pricing for those parts of electric service
which would benefit from competition while preserving a single provider
system where that would be more efficient.
   In a statement, GMP said the auction approach is intended to avoid a
major hang up over the issue of how to determine stranded costs and
revenues. Instead, it said, the market would take care of that
determination.
   GMP said its plan was based on 14 principles for restructuring reached
last July by a Vermont state roundtable on electric industry restructuring.
This included utility recovery of ``reasonable'' stranded costs and the use
of a monthly wires charge to fund conservation, renewables and low income
support programs.
   GMP said that under its plan, the distribution companies would have
direct responsibility for carrying out such service programs.
   The Conservation Law Foundation, which consulted with GMP on the
restructuring plan, immediately issued a statement supporting the GMP
proposal, saying it would continue GMP's demand-side management effort at
about its current $4 million/year level.
   CLF said that by supporting a committed stream of stable funding for
conservation and renewables, GMP was taking a position already supported by
New England Electric System in its restructuring model for New England,
issued in October, 1995.
   The PSB proposed in December that utilities in the state submit
restructuring plans by mid-May 1996. It also proposed a series of
roundtable discussions early in the year after which it will issue
recommendations for specific restructuring plans (NPR, 8 Dec '95, 8).
   GMP is the first utility in the state to submit a full plan and clearly
hopes to get an edge in guiding the upcoming discussions and PBS decisions
over the next six months. It said it hoped to work with other groups in the
state to turn the Green Mountain plan into the ``Vermont Plan.''
   While Vermont Gov. Howard Dean (D) had proposed going to retail choice
by the end of 1997, the PSB has not yet proposed a date for actual
restructuring to begin.

GENERATION, TRANSMISSION, DISTRIBUTION TO BE SPLIT WHEN BGE AND PEPCO
COMBINE

   Baltimore Gas & Electric and Potomac Electric Power will split
generation, transmission and distribution into distinct units when the
companies merge, which is expected in 1997 (NPR, 29 Sept '95, 1).
   They said this separation will ``position the company to better serve
specific customer needs and to be prepared for potential changes in the
utility industry as competition increases.'' The gas business will also be
operated separately, and there will be a distinct District of Columbia unit
to focus on the district's ``unique'' regulatory, legislative and community
relations needs.
   The utilities have also announced that the merged company will be called
Constellation Energy Corp. That is now the name used by BGE's independent
power subsidiary, which has 276 MW of equity in 27 operating plants and 10
more projects under development. The utilities did not say how that unit's
name will be affected.
   After the merger, BGE chairman Christian Poindexter will serve as chief
executive officer of Constellation and PEPCO chairman Edward Mitchell will
be chairman of the board. John Derrick, PEPCO's president and chief
operating officer, will fill those same offices with Constellation, while
Edward Crooke, BGE's president and COO, will become vice chairman of
Constellation, overseeing strategic planning and subsidiaries.
   In the separation of electric functions, the following appointments were
made: Robert Denton, senior vice president for generation; Ronald Lowman,
vice president, fossil; Charles Cruse, vice president, nuclear; William
Sim, vice president, generation support; Thomas Brady, group vice
president, distribution; Andrew Williams, group vice president,
transmission; and Sharon Hostetter, vice president for marketing.

HOLYOKE MUNI WANTS TO TAKE OVER DAM FROM NORTHEAST UTILITIES SUBSIDIARY

   The city of Holyoke, Mass., has begun an effort to take control of the
30.8-MW Hadley Falls hydroelectric station on the Connecticut River which
is now owned by Northeast Utilities subsidiary Holyoke Water Power.
   The 50-year federal license for the dam expires in 1999 and Holyoke said
it plans to ask the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to award the new
operating license to municipal utility Holyoke Gas & Electric.
   Under the plan, the Holyoke muni would add 33 MW of new capacity to the
dam and use the power both to lower costs for its own customers by 17% and
attract new power users to the area based on the low-cost supplies.
   At the same time, NU officials said that Holyoke Water Power intends to
apply to FERC to renew its license to operate the dam. Applications must be
filed to FERC by June 30, 1997.
   The city of Holyoke's plan won support from local voters by a 4 to 1
margin in a non-binding referendum in November 1995. During the campaign,
the city claimed the project would provide benefits to the city of between
$160 million and $250 million over the first 25 years through a combination
of lower cost power, job creation and improved property values.
   It also stressed that the benefits of the dam should go to the city
residents, a clear dig at NU, HWP's out-of-state corporate ownership.
   The city has begun a process to get input from public groups and
agencies and prepare a plan for presentation to FERC. It has asked for
comments by Jan. 28.
   In initial discussions, an intervenor committee for the city of South
Hadley, Mass., which is across the river from Holyoke, has said it will
emphasize in its comments the need for the eventual licensee to remain
financially viable during power industry restructuring in Massachusetts.
   South Hadley also said it wants a full exploration of the environmental
issues involved in expanding the capacity of the dam and whether it would
be environmentally preferable to end all power production at the site.
   Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric has assisted the city with
developing plans for financing the takeover and may possibly provide
financial assistance if the project went ahead.

MOODY'S SEES FALLING UTILITY RATINGS RESULTING FROM INDUSTRY DEREGULATION

   Credit ratings of utilities in the Northeast are particularly vulnerable
to electric industry restructuring, according to a new Moody's Investors
Service report.
   Compared to those in neighboring regions, investor-owned, municipal and
state electric utilities in the Northeast ``with above-average costs are
likely to experience a deterioration in credit quality as some investments
are unrecoverable from customers through rates,'' the agency said in a
prepared statement announcing publication of its report, ``Northeast
Break-Even Analysis,'' authored by vice president and senior analyst Julie
Doetsch, and Tim Fremont.
   Contributing to this deterioration are expensive nuclear and fossil fuel
assets and power purchase contracts with independent producers, much of
which may end up as stranded following deregulation, Moody's said. It
estimated that stranded costs in the Northeast total $43 billion, or 145%
of the combined equity of the utilities in the region. This represents a
quarter of all stranded costs of all U.S. investor-owned utilities.
   ``Moody's does not believe that the Northeast utilities can be shielded
from the negative impact of price competition,'' the agency said. It added
that it expects ``that many of these utilities...will be forced to bear
some of the financial pain associated with the transition. This scenario in
turn may result in a diminished equity cushion available to debtholders,
thus pressuring ratings.'' It said the weighted average rating for
utilities in the region is ``Baa1,'' below the industry average of ``A3.''
   In analyzing the Northeast, Moody's examined ``all major rated utilities
within two transmission interconnnects of Consolidated Edison of New
York,'' including 25 investor-owned utilities in Connecticut, Maine,
Massachusetts, New York, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode
Island and Vermont, plus two public power and two Canadian utilities. The
utilities represent over $153 billion in assets, $29.7 billion in equity
and $48 billion in annual revenues.
   Moody's looked at each utility's cost structure to find what price it
must charge for electric power to ``break even'' and cover its variable and
fixed costs. Hydro-Quebec and the New York Power Authority, relying
primarily on relatively cheap hydropower, fared best cost-wise in this
analysis, while United Illuminating and Long Island Lighting, both at
$105/kW, and Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric, at $99/kW, had the
highest break-even costs.
   Moody's also found that power purchase contracts with NUGs affect the
cost structures of two out of three utilities in the region. ``The most
severely impacted are the small northern New England utilities. When
purchased power is included,'' Moody's said, ``the break-even prices for
Central Vermont Public Service, Central Maine Power, and Bangor
Hydro-Electric each increase over 400%.''

CALPINE SEEKS EWG STATUS FOR PLANTS IN N.J. IT WOULD ACQUIRE FROM O'BRIEN

   Calpine Corp. has asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to
classify two New Jersey projects as exempt wholesale generators. However,
it plans to sell all capacity from the projects to Jersey Central Power &
Light under renegotiated contracts that cut rates, but obligate JCP&L to
pay all gas costs.
   The 122-MW project at DuPont's Parlin facility and the 52-MW Newark
Boxboard plant would be acquired from O'Brien Environmental Energy, which
is under Chapter 11 protection of the federal bankruptcy code.
   Last summer, Philadelphia-based O'Brien agreed to sell all of its assets
to Calpine for $107 million and the assumption of $90 million in debt (NPR,
21 July '95, 13). However, NRG Energy, the affiliate of Northern States
Power, later challenged the sale and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Newark,
N.J., agreed to hold an auction, where other firms could bid for O'Brien.
The court was scheduled to begin hearings on Jan. 3 to consider the offers.
Calpine general counsel Joseph Ronan said he is optimistic, since O'Brien
had rejected an NRG offer before the original takeover deal was struck.
   Although EWG status allows power producers to operate ``merchant''
plants, selling to various buyers, that is not Calpine's intention,
according to Ronan. He said the San Jose, Calif., firm plans to sell all
electric output from the plants to the current buyer, JCP&L. However, it
wants to avoid disputes over qualifying facility status under the Public
Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA).
   That law requires certain efficiency standards for both electric and
thermal output, and JCP&L challenged the QF status of both O'Brien plants
after prolonged outages due to a fire in Newark and technical problems at
Parlin. If a project loses its QF status, the utility can revoke contract
terms and pay only its avoided cost--as Rochester Gas & Electric recently
sought to do to a Kamine/Besicorp project, before a federal court granted a
temporary QF waiver (NPR, 8 Dec '95, 11). Calpine had already faced the
problem when its Watsonville, Calif., plant lost its steam host, Ronan
noted.
   Before applying for EWG status for the New Jersey plants, Calpine
renegotiated the power sales contracts with JCP&L, Ronan said. The new
terms provide JCP&L with more dispatching at Parlin and rate changes at
both facilities. Under the new Parlin contract, only 41 MW of the 122-MW
plant will be considered ``base capacity (though that can rise as high as
50 MW under certain conditions), while the balance is divided into several
levels of dispatch capacity.
   For the Parlin base load, JCP&L will make capacity payments of 5.97
cents/kWh during the on-peak period, and no payments off-peak. For the
dispatchable capacity, the utility will make fixed capital payments of
$9.90/kW/month through 2003, and $6.40 afterwards, though Calpine may elect
to levelize all payments at $9.02. In addition, JCP&L will pay $3.50 in
1995 for operations and maintenance, adjusted annually.
   At the Newark plant, JCP&L will pay a base rate of 4.325 cents/kWh,
adjusted according to various indices. In the original O'Brien contract,
JCP&L was paying 6.17 cents.
   In both cases, JCP&L would pay for all costs of natural gas, supplying
the projects from the gas pool that parent company General Public Utilities
has set up (NPR, 15 Sept '95, 14). Although it started that pool to cut
costs for its own peakers, GPU said it would also allow non-utility
generators to participate if they agreed to renegotiate contracts.

JCP&L SEEKS $18-MILLION RATE RECOVERY FOR BUYOUT OF CROWN/VISTA CONTRACTS

   Jersey Central Power & Light has asked the New Jersey Board of Public
Utilities to let it collect $18 million in rates to cover the buyout of two
100-MW contracts with an independent power producer.
   JCP&L reached a settlement with the developers of the Crown/Vista coal
project after a long dispute that wound through the BPU, state courts and
the state legislature (NPR, 15 Sept '95, 9). The 362-MW coal project was
originally proposed by Mission Energy and Fluor Daniel in 1989, but Fluor
Daniel later sold its stake to Ahlstrom Development and Entergy Power
Development. When the partners concluded they could not bring the twin coal
plants on-line by the 1997 ``sunset dates,'' they were granted an extension
by the BPU.
   The utility--which chose 200 MW of the project in a 1989
solicitation--said it no longer needed the capacity and successfully
challenged the extension in state court (NPR, 26 May '95, 6). The
developers then got the backing of some state lawmakers to force the
extension, but the buyout was announced before their bill cleared the
legislature.
   To terminate the contracts, JCP&L agreed to pay $17 million, but it is
asking to collect $18 million in rates, to cover all of its costs. That
would be recovered in blocks of $6-million over each of the next three
years. The utility defended the request, saying purchases from the
Crown/Vista project would have cost $700 million above market prices over
the lives of the contracts.
   JCP&L is looking to collect the funds through the Levelized Energy
Adjustment Clause (LEAC), which passes along energy costs and other
expenses without profit. In its $37.7 million request, the utility is also
looking to recover $19 million in demand-side management costs.
   Metropolitan Edison, another unit of General Public Utilities, also
terminated its 100-MW contract with the Crown/Vista developers, and has
asked the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission for rate recovery. That
buyout cost $30 million because of the different timing of the contracts
and the costs incurred by the developers.

N.Y. PSC CONSIDERS RECOMMENDATION TO REVISE AVOIDED-COST CALCULATIONS

   An administrative law judge in New York's Public Service Department is
recommending new long-run avoided cost calculation methods that would more
accurately reflect industry costs. Adoption by the Public Service
Commission of the new method could result in an increase in the costs
incurred by utilities and ratepayers in doing business with independent
power producers, according to the recommendation.
   The recommendation, issued Dec. 19 by administrative law judge Rafael
Epstein, is part of another recommendation to establish a process for
setting fuel targets and buyback rates. Both cases (93-E-0912; 93-E-1075)
were combined in January 1995. Briefs opposing the recommendations are due
Jan. 8, 1996; final briefs are due Jan. 25.
   The recommendation to revise calculation methodology endorses in
principle independent power producer Sithe Energies' proposal to adopt the
`firm method' for estimating avoided energy costs, not the `non-firm
method' now employed by the PSC and favored by the utilities and staff.
Epstein recommends exploring the firm method's application before using
it.
   The recommendation calls for a generic annual proceeding based on a
unified data base, a conclusion supported by staff and Sithe, but opposed
by the utilities. As it is now, fuel targets and buyback rates are
determined in utility-specific rate proceedings. Epstein recommends that
the commission should narrowly limit the permissible scope of
company-specific adjustments prompted by individual utility's objections
provided in the computer model's data base produced in the generic case.
   Epstein also recommends that the commission adopt four previous rulings
as the basis for determining which computer model inputs should be deemed
trade secrets. He urged that data ought to be considered a trade secret
only if the information is competitively useful and would not be readily
ascertainable by competitors in an unregulated market.

NEES CANNOT CHARGE FIRM TRANSMISSION RATE FOR PART NON-FIRM SERVICE: FERC

   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has told New England Electric
System that it cannot charge a full firm transmission rate for service to a
group of Massachusetts municipals unless it actually provides them with
firm service.
   In a Dec. 29 order, FERC said that NEES could not charge the firm
service rate to carry 35.4 MW of preference power to the munis from the New
York Power Authority since it was providing firm service for only 17.7 MW
of the load (Doc. No. ER96-200-000).
   It approved for filing a firm service charge for the 17.7 MW and
required NEES to file within 30 days a new, lower cost rate for the
less-than-firm service it was offering for the rest of the load.
   NEES originally filed the transmission rate proposal on Oct. 31, 1995,
saying that it was the result of negotiations with Massachusetts Municipal
Wholesale Electric.
   According to NEES, it was not obliged to offer any firm service to the
municipals and as part of the negotiations it had voluntarily agreed to
provide the 17.7 MW of firm capacity at MMWEC's request. In return, MMWEC
agreed to pay the firm rate for the entire 35.4-MW load.
   The group was under pressure to secure the capacity to bring in the
low-cost power from NYPA's Niagara Falls and St. Lawrence projects.
However, the town of Norwood questioned the arrangement and said that in
the past FERC had always required NEES to provide lower rates to the group
for non-firm service.
   In its order, FERC agreed with this argument, saying that the mere fact
MMWEC agreed to pay the high rate did not make it legally acceptable. Also,
the fact that NEES was voluntarily offering 17.7 MW of firm service as part
of the deal ``was not a sufficient justification for charging a firm rate
for transmission that is less than firm,'' FERC said.
   According to FERC, NEES could collect the full rate for the firm
service, but it had no right to charge ``excessive'' rates for the non-firm
service.
   FERC also granted a waiver of the normal 60-day notice period to allow
the rate to take effect at once. The parties had originally aimed at
beginning service by Nov. 1, 1995.
   Currently, the NEES firm transmission tariff is about $16/kW/year. The
FERC order said that NEES did not have to offer the municipals its standard
non-firm rate but instead could propose a rate reflecting the fact that the
non-firm service agreed to in the negotiations with MMWEC would provide
some advantages over normal non-firm service.

HOULTON, ME., WATER CO. GAINS NEPOOL MEMBERSHIP; BUYS FROM BOUGHT-OUT NUG

   The New England Power Pool has agreed to allow the Houlton Water Co. in
Houlton, Me., to become a member, although it is not located within the
NEPOOL control area.
   The publicly owned utility in northern Maine is connected to the rest of
New England through New Brunswick Power and was asked to make specific
promises to NEPOOL on meeting capacity responsibility requirements in order
to join the group.
   In 1994, Houlton decided to drop wholesale purchases from Maine Public
Service, which is located in the same area. Instead, it decided to take
12.5 MW of supplies from a biomass power plant in Fort Fairfield, Me.,
taken over by Central Maine Power through an earlier buyout deal.
   Houlton switched to the CMP supplies effective Jan. 1, 1996, and under a
proposal filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Dec. 11,
1995, it will become a NEPOOL member Feb. 1.
   NEPOOL said in its FERC filing that because of the link through Canada,
Houlton would require scheduling arrangements inside the NEPOOL dispatching
system different than those used by other members. These were being worked
out with Houlton.
   Also, NEPOOL said, Houlton would not have to include in its adjusted
load 3.4 MW from the Maine Yankee plant which is backed up by New Brunswick
Power resources.
   Separately, Houlton and MPS are continuing a dispute before FERC over
the level of transmission costs MPS will be able to charge Houlton for use
of its system to wheel power from the Fort Fairfield plant (Doc. No.
ER95-836-000).
   MPS proposed a general transmission tariff in April, 1995, based on a
levelized rate calculation system which would result in a $35/kW/year
charge (NPR, 14 April '95, 5).
   Houlton claims this rate is exorbitant and called it a ``back door
attempt'' by MPS to cover stranded investment costs.
   With the case still before the judge, no FERC decision on the
transmission rate is likely for several months. Under the current
arrangement, Houlton begins accepting service from MPS on Jan. 1 at the
proposed MPS rate. But it will be entitled to a rebate if FERC later
decides to lower that rate.
   In its arguments to FERC, MPS stressed that its proposal was based on
new FERC guidelines for transmission ratemaking. Also, it said that former
wholesale customers such as Houlton were not entitled to special low rates
from MPS and should pay the same generic rate offered to other customers.
   Houlton argued that because MPS' transmission plant is old and heavily
depreciated the levelized system did not apply. But MPS said that it
planned major new improvements to its transmission system and a levelized
approach was appropriate.

MAINE YANKEE OUTPUT TO BE LIMITED TO 90% DUE TO COOLING PUMP CONCERNS

   The Maine Yankee nuclear plant will only be allowed to operate at 90% of
full capacity, or 820 MW, when it returns to service early in 1996 after a
12-month outage to repair cracked tubes in the plant's steam generator.
   The derating is being imposed on the plant by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission based on claims by an anonymous whistleblower that the plant's
emergency core cooling pumps could not handle the reactor if it was
operating at full power.
   The claims, received by the NRC in early December, said that plant
operators knew about the problem in the late 1980s but nevertheless asked
NRC to upgrade the plant capacity to 910 MW. The derating will effectively
put the plant back to its original rating.
   The derating will be in effect until the NRC does a thorough review of
the situation, including the computer modeling techniques used to determine
proper safety levels. It is not clear how long the review will take.
   In the meantime, Maine Yankee officials were awaiting a memo from the
NRC detailing the exact operating conditions for the plant. Once they
receive it they expect to restart the reactor immediately.
   Maine Yankee has just completed a major project to sleeve the tubes in
its two steam generators to prevent cracking (NPR, 26 May '95, 10). The
project cost plant owners, including Central Maine Power, Northeast
Utilities and New England Electric System, $30 million in repair costs and
$60 million in replacement power costs.
   The loss of the 90 MW of capacity due to the derating will create a new
financial burden although plant officials could not predict the cost at
this time. A spokesman for CMP said that the actual cost will depend on
whether the winter is colder than usual and more peaking power is needed
and also on the availability of extra hydro capacity in the region based on
higher than usual water levels.
   The claims about the coolant system have no connection to the steam
generator repairs which plant officials said went well and came in only a
few days late and under budget.
   Maine Yankee president Charles Frizzle said that with the sleeving done
there was no reason to think that the plant would not be able to function
normally for the rest of its license period, which ends in 2008.
   Anti-nuclear groups have questioned this. Also, Standard & Poor's has
raised concerns about Maine Yankee's ability to maintain plant performance
over the long term, issuing a downgrade of Maine Yankee's corporate credit
rating in December.

1,100-MW SALEM NUCLEAR UNITS TO RETURN TO SERVICE IN SECOND AND THIRD
QUARTERS

   Public Service Electric & Gas expects to bring the Salem nuclear units
back into service in the second and third quarters of 1996. Each unit
generates 1,100 MW for a consortium of utilities that includes PSE&G (43%
ownership), PECO Energy (43%), Atlantic Electric (7%) and Delmarva Power
(7%).
   The plants were shut down in May and June for unrelated problems with
heat removal equipment and switch gear cooling fans (NPR, 23 June '95, 7).
Although these were not major flaws, station operator PSE&G came to an
agreement with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to keep the plants down
for extended outages in order to thoroughly inspect the problems and take
preventive steps (NPR, 4 Aug '95, 10).
   The Salem station has been plagued by recurring shutdowns, and the
restart plans call for improving human performance, operations,
maintenance, equipment reliability and other areas.
   PSE&G originally expected Unit 1 to be operating by the first quarter of
1996 and Unit 2 by the second quarter, but those schedules have now been
pushed back. The utility has been purchasing power in the wholesale market
to make up the shortfall, while PECO already has excess generating
capacity.

PSE&G OPENS 150-MW CAPACITY BLOCK IN ITS DSM `STANDARD OFFER' PROGRAM

   Public Service Electric & Gas will be seeking 150 MW of capacity from
energy efficiency projects over the next two years.
   That block was set by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities in a
recent ruling on the utility's demand-side management program for 1996-97
(Docket No. EE95090415). PSE&G had originally requested a one-year, 75-MW
standard offer, but DSM advocates pushed to expand the plan and the BPU
agreed.
   Under the standard offer program, PSE&G makes blocks of capacity
available and pays its avoided cost to energy efficiency projects. Since
1993, the utility has been accepting bids for a 150-MW block, and in the
recent case the BPU expanded that Standard Offer No. 1 to 185 MW for
proposals submitted by Jan. 2, 1996.
   The new 150-MW solicitation is designated Standard Offer No. 2, and will
be broken into three 50-MW blocks. These will provide declining payments,
since additional capacity will reduce the value of savings to the company,
and thereby, its avoided cost. That figure now stands at $5.45/kW/month for
capacity and about 2.6 cents/kWh for energy. However, the first 50-MW block
of the new standard offer will set prices 27% lower, while the second block
will be priced 33% below Standard Offer No. 1 and the third block will be
set 38% below it.
   The BPU made allowance for a fourth block with no defined size at prices
that would be 44% lower than Standard Offer No. 1. There will also be a
15-MW residential ``carve-out,'' with at least half of that reserved for
low-income residences. For those projects, prices will be set 14% higher
than Standard Offer No. 1 for the first half of the contract period and 33%
lower for the second half.
   In addition, PSE&G will accept up to 10 MW of fuel-switching projects,
but only at government-owned facilities. It will also accept up to 1 MW of
projects that displace electric air conditioning in summer with chillers
powered by waste heat from cogeneration plants. These must involve existing
cogeneration facilities that exceed 50% efficiency, and they must not
result in incremental fuel use or emissions.
   If New Jersey opens up retail competition, PSE&G will continue to make
standard offer payments to projects whose hosts choose an electric supplier
other than the utility. However, that pledge would only apply if PSE&G is
still allowed to recover its standard offer payments through some type of
system benefits charge. DSM proponents in many states are lobbying for such
charges on distribution services to maintain efficiency programs in the
face of retail access.
   PSE&G accepts standard offer projects on a first-come, first-served
basis, though they must be qualified by PSE&G for technical merit and
savings potential. They may be installed by users themselves or by energy
service companies. One ESCO that is active in the program is PSE&G's own
subsidiary, Public Service Conservation Resources Corp. (PSCRC), which
works with customers on standard offer projects and provides financing.

MONITOR: CON ED IS SLOW ON CLEAN-UP, AND CRACKS DOWN ON WHISTLE BLOWERS

   A court-appointed environmental monitor has found that Consolidated
Edison's environmental programs still have significant shortcomings and
that the utility has discouraged proper reporting of environmental
mishaps.
   ``In at least one instance,'' the monitor states in his first report
since being named last spring, ``there has been direct retaliation against
an employee who reported information to me.''
   Appointment of the monitor, Mitchell Bernard, came as part of the
sentence handed down after Con Ed pleaded guilty to having conspired to
cover up the release of asbestos in a 1989 steam pipe explosion. The
utility was also fined $2 million. U.S. District Court Judge John Martin,
who sentenced Con Ed, received the monitor's report Dec. 18.
   The monitor writes that Con Ed generally cooperated with his
investigations, as required by the court. But he cites some notable
exceptions: a few employees were ``less than open'' in answering questions;
and Con Ed ``failed to comply'' with the court's direction that it not
penalize an employee in any way for providing information to the monitor.
   Con Ed ``has taken a number of commendable steps to promote
environmental compliance,'' the monitor notes. He recognizes the creation
of an internal mechanism for investigating reports of environmental
misconduct and the hiring of a new vice president for environmental
affairs, among other actions.
   ``At this point, however, Con Edison is without many of the basic
elements of an effective program to prevent and detect violations of
environmental laws,'' the monitor concludes. Key problems include:
ineffectiveness in the company's new Compliance Administrators Program;
indications of ``an ongoing destructive corporate culture''; and problems
handling asbestos.
   ``We take this report very seriously,'' said a Con Ed spokesman. The
report ``acknowledges that we have improved our environmental awareness but
that we have a lot more to do,'' he added.
   Episodes of improper treatment of employees who reported possible
environmental hazards, brought to the company's attention by the monitor's
report, have resulted in a number of specific disciplinary actions. Con Ed
explained, in a response that was also filed with the court, that two
supervisors have been suspended without pay, and that other individuals
have been disciplined.
   ``These were isolated instances,'' the spokesman said. However, any
similar incidents in the future in which an employee is punished or
intimidated will result in dismissal of the supervisor. ``We will not
tolerate intimidation of employees who bring forward environmental
complaints.'' The spokesman acknowledged that ``we have to educate our
employees about our company's environmental policies.''
   The most serious of the incidents of intimidation involved spilled oil
and water that leaked down a drain at a Con Ed service center and a problem
in the company's asbestos abatement program.
   Overall, the monitor writes that he ``uncovered significant problems.''
The most common, he concludes, were related to the cleanup of
polychlorinated biphenyls and to asbestos abatement projects.

SPOT U PRICE IN U.S. RISES ABRUPTLY; DOC CLEARS ENTERGY LEU SHIPMENT

By:
Michael Knapik, Washington; Ray Silver, Toronto; Ann MacLachlan, Paris

The spot uranium price in the U.S. rose in the last weeks in December. The
Uranium Exchange Co. raised its spot U3O8 price to $12.10 per pound on
December 18; Washington Nuclear Corp. raised its U3O8 price December 21 to
$12.50/lb. Some analysts thought that latter figure was high, but most
agreed that the market was clearly trending upward.
   In deals completed before the holidays, Cameco apparently selected
several suppliers to fill its request for offers for 700,000 U3O8, but will
probably not buy the entire amount. The mining company, sources said,
didn't see any offers below $12/lb and will probably buy much of the
material at a price around $12.25/lb, plus or minus 10 cents. Some offers
reportedly as high as $12.50/lb were considered, but several others with
prices a $1 or so higher than that were dismissed.
   British Nuclear Fuels reportedly also selected more than one supplier,
reportedly for more than 200,000 lb U3O8. One source suggested that the
company may have bought as much as 500,000 lb U3O8 equivalent at prices
ranging from $12.20/lb to slightly above $12.40/lb.
   San Diego Gas & Electric is said to have selected a supplier for U3O8.
(The utility had been looking for offers to supply 223,000 lb.) The price
is said to be at or slightly above $11.85/lb, the TradeTech value at the
end of November. Said one source, ``San Diego and Wisconsin Public Service
(which is still evaluating offers) may have seen the last of the
under-$12/lb uranium.''
   At press time there was a report that Consumers Power was out looking
for a supply of 600,000 lb U3O8.
   Fermco, the company in charge of cleaning up the DOE defense facility at
Fernald in Ohio, solicited offers last month for the purchase 484,061 lb of
excess normal uranium, which is in various forms including derbies, ingots,
recyclable metal, and UF4. The minimum acceptable price, the solicitation
said, was $2.04/lb--$1.36/lb for the material and $0.68/lb for analysis,
handling, and packaging. Bids were due December 20. According to sources,
Fermco received expressions of interest from four companies.
   In NuclearFuel's judgment, significant open-market transactions in the
U.S. during the forward two-week period could be concluded within the range
of $12.00-$12.40/lb U3O8, a rise from the range reported two weeks ago of
$11.80-$12.10/lb. So-called unrestricted buyers, those able to use uranium
from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), could probably conclude
a deal within the range of $10.00-$10.30/lb, a slight rise in the range
reported two weeks ago of $9.90-$10.20/lb.

DOC Clears Import Of Entergy LEU
   A shipment of low-enriched uranium (LEU) destined for use in one of
Entergy's reactors was finally released December 21 by the U.S. Customs
Service after the import was cleared by the Department of Commerce. The
material, enriched at Eurodif and imported by Cogema Inc., contained
uranium originally from Kazakstan and/or Uzbekistan. Sources said DOC
cleared the shipment after Entergy agreed to match an equal quantity of the
uranium with newly produced U.S. uranium. Neither DOC nor Entergy officials
were available to confirm that report, however.
   Under the terms of the antidumping suspension agreements with those
countries, the origin of the uranium does not change when it is enriched in
a third country and therefore, the uranium can only be imported right now
into the U.S. under the quota systems in both suspension agreements.
   Joseph Spetrini, DOC deputy assistant secretary for import
administration, has been trying to negotiate an agreement to grandfather
some of the so-called bypass Uzbek and Kazak uranium. In October, Spetrini
proposed to grandfather 75% of the uranium utilities contracted for before
March 27, the date the Kazak agreement was signed. The remaining 25% could
come in if the utilities matched the uranium with newly produced U.S.
uranium. The mining company petitioners, including Cogema Inc.'s Pathfinder
Mines, protested to Spetrini and told him that they would agree to
grandfathering only under certain conditions.
   Spetrini found himself in a bind and, according to one source, was
facing the threat of a lawsuit by Entergy if the shipment was not cleared.
   (Washington Nuclear reported that Customs cleared the five containers of
Entergy's LEU that had been held up at Portsmouth, Va. since December 8.)
   On the Entergy shipment, DOC, according to one source, ``used chewing
gum to patch together'' the settlement, allowing Commerce to make the call
to Customs to clear the shipment. The mining companies apparently didn't
agree to the settlement and still maintain that there is no legal basis to
let the uranium in.

Miners' Conditions For Grandfathering
   The ad hoc group of U.S. uranium mining companies, petitioners in the
antidumping cases, submitted a confidential set of conditions that they say
must be met for them to agree to any grandfathering of Uzbek or Kazak
uranium (NF, 18 Dec. '95, 2). The miners say these conditions represent ``a
firm position of industry.'' Among the conditions, sources said, are the
following: The quantity of grandfathered material is not to exceed
9.5-million lb; the material to be allowed in without restrictions must be
only 75% of the nominal quantity contracted for; the matched sales to allow
import of the remaining 25% must be done by June 30 and must be matched
with newly produced U.S. uranium; the utility contracts for the purchase of
Uzbek or Kazak uranium concluded after March 27 and those not brought to
DOC's attention in response to September 22 Federal Register notice would
not be eligible for grandfathering; and the DOC must reverse its
interpretation of the Uzbek agreement--and an interpretation that allows
for a doubling quota amount to 1.88-million lb U3O8 per year after 1996.
   ``There are limits to industry's willingness to accept mechanisms which
will flood the U.S. market with dumped CIS uranium,'' the miners said.
``Those limits have been reached.''

Australian Analysts See $14.25/lb U Price in 1996
   Analyst Daniel Stubbs of the Australian Bureau of Agriculture & Resource
Economics is predicting that the average spot uranium price will rise to
(US)$14.25/lb U3O8 in 1996 from $11.50/lb in 1995. Stubbs and fellow
analyst Charles Millsteed are predicting that in the longer term, the spot
price will increase to $19.70/lb ($17/lb in 1995 dollars) by the end of
2000. Rising prices will lead to increased production from Australia's two
operating companies--Energy Resources of Australia and Western Mining Corp.
The cost of production in Australian uranium mines is estimated to be in
the range of $10-$15/lb U3O8. Production is expected to rise from 4,700
metric tons U3O8 to 6,300 MT in 1999-2000, the analysts say. The articles
about uranium appeared in the December 1995 issue of the journal Australian
Commodities.

INI: Price Spike In 1998, But Softening Thereafter
   International Nuclear Inc. (INI), whose president is ex-Nuexco analyst
David Schramm, has recently completed an analysis of the market that
forecasts a spot market price spike by 1998, but with the price softening
after that. INI says it believes the spot price in constant 1995 dollars
will be in the $16.50 range by 1998 but will fall by the year 2000 to
around $14.80/lb U3O8. The spiking will occur, INI believes, because of
pressure to produce more uranium as utility stocks get used up over the
next two years. The softening will occur, however, as more blended-down HEU
enters the market under the formula called for in the pending U.S.
Enrichment Corp. privatization bill and as more uranium enters the U.S.
from Kazakstan and Uzbekistan under their suspension agreement quotas, INI
believes. INI, as do most analysts, foresees essentially flat requirements
over the next five years.
   INI also believes there could be a rising premium for longer-term
contracts, and it forecasts a base price for those types of contracts in
the mid-$18/lb range by 1998.

ESA Advisory Group Elects New Officers
   The Euratom Supply Agency's advisory group met last month to elect new
officers and hear updates on various items of interest, but took no new
initiatives, participants reported.
   Elected chairman was Jose-Luis Gonzalez of Enusa; new vice chairmen are
Stig Sandklef of Vattenfall Fuel and H. Blackwell Gresley of Urenco Ltd.
   The committee heard a brief report on the U.S.-Euratom agreement for
nuclear cooperation, now under review by the U.S. Congress, and on
relations with Russia and the ex-Soviet republics that export uranium, but
a source said there is ``nothing new'' in the latter field. The committee
will have to tackle the issue during the coming year, to define whether and
how the ESA's ``common policy'' of limiting nuclear materials imports from
Russia must change when the overall European Union-Russian Federation
partnership and cooperation agreement enters into force, in principle on
January 1, 1997. The agreement calls for free trade between the two parties
on that date, but the EU insisted on a potential exemption for nuclear
trade if the required market conditions are not fulfilled.

Linder Fund Buys More Stock In URI
   Uranium Resources announced December 26 that one of its largest
stockholders--the Linder Dividend Fund Inc.--had exercised it rights under
a May 1995 warrant agreement to buy more common stock in the company. The
exercise of 500,000 warrants will infuse the company with $2-million in
working capital for project development and other purposes.
   URI said that it expects production to begin at its Kingsville Dome site
late in the first quarter. Combined with production from Rosita, URI said
it expects to produce more than 2-million lb in 1996. In 1995, URI said
610,000 lb U3O8 were produced at Rosita.
   URI's stock closed December 26 at 5 3/8, with 16,800 shares being
traded. Its 52-week high was 8 5/8.

Court Okays Denison Restructure
   Four days before Christmas, Denison Mines President Bill James announced
a new deal for shareholders who have been in financial limbo for four years
since Ontario Hydro canceled its long-term commitment to buy 100-million lb
of high-cost Elliot Lake uranium. With final approval from the Ontario
Court of Justice, General Division, James said the company could proceed
with a restructuring plan that will reclassify existing Class A, Class B
and preferred shares into new common shares. The new shares should be
listed for trading on Montreal and Toronto stock exchanges by January 3, he
said.
   ``It has been a long road and all stakeholders have paid a price. The
(federal and Ontario) governments have provided interest relief on taxes
and a postponement of taxes payable; corporate lenders and Canada Mortgage
& Housing Corp. have given interest, principal and repayment concessions;
preferred shareholders have agreed to eliminate a large amount of dividends
in arrears and their priority on liquidation; Class A and Class B
shareholders have accepted a significant dilution of their equity
interest,'' James explained. The provincial government have made
concessions in exchange for assurance that decommissioning of Denison
Mines' Elliot Lake mine-mill facility would be completed.
   ``As a result of the stakeholders contributions, Denison has been
preserved as a going concern and its capital structure have been
substantially improved,'' James noted.

Czech Deal With Cameco
   The first company in Eastern Europe to take its uranium conversion
business to Canada, the Czech electric power utility CEZ has contracted
with Cameco Corp. for conversion services at Port Hope, Ontario. Noting
that the Soviet Union previously met such nuclear fuel demands, Cameco
Chairman and President Bernard Michel said the CEZ deal ``reflects the
changing global marketplace as Eastern European countries open their doors
to Western business.'' Cameco would not say how much uranium would be
involved nor the dollar value of the CEZ contract.

MINATOM OFFICIAL CALLS FOR MAKE-OR-BREAK DECISION ON KRASNOYARSK RT-2
PLANT

By:
Mark Hibbs, Moscow

   Prospects for completing the RT-2 reprocessing plant at Krasnoyarsk-26
are bleak, according to a key official at the Russian Ministry of Atomic
Energy (Minatom).
   RT-2, with a design throughput of 1,500 metric tons heavy metal (MTHM)
per year, was supposed to reprocess spent fuel from VVER-1000 plants.
Construction began in 1987 but was stopped two years later for lack of
funds (NF, 4 Jan. '89, 5). Meanwhile, spent fuel is being stored at
reactors and at an interim storage facility adjacent to the RT-2
construction site at Krasnoyarsk-26.
   Evgeny Mikerin, who heads up nuclear fuel production at Minatom, said
last month the plant is about 30% complete. Since 1989, the project has
been modified to include design innovations, including safety improvements
in the aftermath of an explosion at a separation plant at Tomsk-7 (NF, 12
April '93, 1). If construction were to resume now, Mikerin said, RT-2 could
be completed by the end of 2003.
   Construction cannot proceed, however, until regulator Gosatomnadzor and
local authorities review reports required under Russia's new nuclear
licensing laws, passed in mid-1995. Mikerin said Minatom anticipates
difficulties in getting all consulting experts to agree on the contents of
an ecological report that must be submitted to licensing authorities.
   In the meantime, Mikerin said, Minatom has not appropriated any
construction funding for the project. Russian media reported in early 1995
that following a decree by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to complete
RT-2, that the central government, Minatom, and local and regional
authorities earmarked more than $100-million for the project. But Mikerin
said those reports were false.
   ``There is no money for RT-2 beyond the small amounts required to
maintain the infrastructure already there,'' he said. Mikerin added that,
because construction on the Siberian site had started nearly 10 years ago,
infrastructure maintenance must be funded at a higher level now in order to
prevent the equipment from deteriorating.

Taiwan, ROK Won't Take Back HLW
   There also is no longer an agreement inside the Russian administration
on the project's cost. Mikerin said that while costs associated with RT-1
have been rising, cost estimates for the construction and operation of RT-2
also have increased. But, he said, ``the government has taken no decision
on this as of yet.''
   He said Minatom still is looking for foreign partners wanting to
reprocess fuel at RT-2 ``because we cannot continue to depend upon
government support.'' Mikerin said on December 5, ``As of today, all those
(parties) we have discussed the project with have declined'' to be
involved.
   Mikerin confirmed that utilities in Germany and Switzerland have
formally declined to consider a reprocessing joint venture at
Krasnoyarsk-26. He said that talks also had been held with utilities in
Taiwan and the Republic of Korea (ROK). Those potential clients have not
categorically withdrawn from the talks, Mikerin said. But the two Asian
states are not yet willing to take back high-level reprocessing waste
(HLW), he added. That takeback is now required by Russian law.
   Mikerin also contradicted speculation that Japan, as part of an ongoing
review of its own reprocessing expansion program, might fund completion of
RT-2 to reprocess Japanese spent fuel. The Minatom official said that
nuclear political relations between Tokyo and Moscow are ``not good'' and
are hampered by a long-running dispute about Russian Navy low-level waste
dumping off Russia's Pacific Coast. Under these circumstances, he said, it
is not possible to strike a deal with Japan involving RT-2.
   Mikerin acknowledged that the slow pace of Minatom's nuclear power
development program since the Chernobyl accident in 1986 now poses problems
for the economics of the reprocessing project. At 1,500 MTHM/yr, RT-2 was
designed to be much too large for the current projected demand.
   ``It's time to make hard decisions about RT-2'' Mikerin said. ``If we
want to finish it, we should find the money and do so--now. If not, we
should give it up.''
   The interim storage facility at Krasnoyarsk-26 for VVER-1000 spent fuel
is 15% full, Mikerin said, compared to 13% at the end of 1994.
   As a result of a government-to-government agreement with Ukraine, about
half the spent fuel to be added to the storage facility will come from
VVER-1000 units in Ukraine, he said.
   Following a commercial contract two years ago, Ukraine is trying to pay
for the storage of its spent fuel at Krasnoyarsk-26. About half of the
payments it makes to Minatom are in cash. The rest are in barter, mostly in
food and stainless steel tubing provided in advance for RT-2, as well as
zirconium and a small amount of uranium ore.
   While RT-2 could be ready in eight years if approved and funded, Minatom
officials said, without foreign help, it will take longer for Russia to
digest the plutonium output of the plant in the form of plutonium-uranium
fuel.
   So far, Mikerin said, an experimental fabrication line for
plutonium-based fast reactor fuel at Chelyabinsk-65 has produced only two
to three assemblies per year. They have been loaded into the BN-600 fast
reactor at Beloyarsk, near Ekaterinburg. The reactor, like most other
Soviet-design fast reactors, has traditionally operated on uranium fuel
enriched to up to 25% U-235.

LA HAGUE SITE REACHES NOMINAL PRODUCTION; MELOX GEARS UP

By:
Ann MacLachlan, Paris

   Cogema's La Hague reprocessing site reached its nominal capacity for the
first time in 1995, processing some 1,550 metric tons heavy metal (MTHM),
despite the labor unrest that slowed production in June, said Jean-Louis
Ricaud, the company's reprocessing chief.
   The UP3 plant that reprocesses foreign reactor fuel was commissioned in
1990 but reached its nominal capacity of 800 MTHM/year five years later.
UP2-800, commissioned in August 1994, took less than a year to reach the
same target, Cogema officials point out, saying this demonstrates the
company's mastery of the industrial process.
   Ricaud said that Cogema's mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel fabrication complex
also is gearing up, with the refurbished Cadarache MOX plant having
manufactured more than 30 MTHM of fuel for Electricite de France (EDF) in
1995.
   The much bigger Melox MOX plant at Marcoule produced low-enrichment and
medium-enrichment MOX pins last year, but complete fuel assemblies included
high-enrichment pins made in Cadarache, he said. About 70-75 fuel
assemblies were produced at the plant, or 20 MTHM equivalent of MOX fuel.
   But Melox will really begin full production in 1996, Ricaud said. ``We
are confident that the plant will be able to deliver 85 tons to EDF in 1996
with the label `Made in Melox,' as scheduled,'' he said.
   The nominal capacity of Melox is 120 MTHM/year. Cogema has announced
plans to increase that to 160 MTHM/year in the near term.

BNFL TAPS EXXON CHEMICAL VICE PRESIDENT FOR COMPANY'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE SLOT

   British Nuclear Fuels plc (BNFL) has confirmed the appointment of
international chemical industry executive John Taylor as its new chief
executive. His appointment will go into effect in March.
   Taylor, currently a vice president of Brussels-based Exxon Chemical
Europe Inc., replaces Neville Chamberlain. Last month Chamberlain left that
post for a promotion as deputy chairman of BNFL (NF, 4 Dec. '95, 11).
Chamberlain is combining both roles until Taylor's installation.
   BNFL is beefing up its top management in efforts to maximize overseas
opportunities. Taylor, 48, has been with Exxon Chemical for 26 years,
holding a number of senior international management positions in the U.K.,
U.S. and Belgium.
   Taylor said that BNFL's improved safety and environmental performance,
coupled with recent successes in winning international business, made it an
``exciting time...to move the company forward.'' BNFL was recently named
the U.K.'s fastest growing large exporter (NF, 23 Oct. '95, 8).
   Taylor's appointment coincided with BNFL's announcement that site work
has started on a revolutionary 360-million-pound (U.S.$560-million) plant
to treat intermediate-level radioactive waste (ILW). The plant is expected
to cut 500-million pounds from the lifetime costs of BNFL's ILW program and
to attract international business with its state-of-the-art technology.
   The Sellafield Drypac plant, scheduled to come on line in 2002, will
convert wet ILW into dry material that can be compacted, mixed with
concrete, and packed in 500-liter stainless steel containers. Main building
and civil contract work on the plant is due to start April 1997.

YEAR LATER PASSAGE OF WASTE BILL REMAINS AN INDUSTRY TOP PRIORITY

   The nuclear power industry has no ``Plan B'' up its sleeve in the event
nuclear waste legislation does not pass this year, said Joseph Colvin,
executive vice president of the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI).
   ``There is a strong consensus across the nation this needs to be done,''
he said.
   A year after the industry trade association set waste legislation as its
top priority for 1995, a congressional fix of the faltering DOE waste
program still has top billing. But Colvin remains optimistic that can be
accomplished.
   Even as the Upton-Towns nuclear waste bill, H.R. 1020, became bogged
down in congressional budget battles on Capitol Hill, it remained one of
the strongest bipartisan bills making its way through the legislative
process, he said. Supported by the Republican leadership and such
influential Democrats as Reps. John Dingell of Michigan and Frank Pallone
Jr. of New Jersey, the bill has a hefty list of supporters.
   More than 230 members of the House are ready to move on the bill,
according to Colvin.

Breaking The `Scoring' Logjam
   NEI has sent suggested solutions to the House Commerce Committee in an
effort to break the ``scoring'' logjam that prevented the bill from moving
to the floor in 1995. Earlier Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich
(R-Ohio) had warned that the user fee provisions in the bill would require
about $4.2-billion in new offsetting budget cuts.
   Under H.R. 1020, money collected from nuclear utility ratepayers to fund
the DOE waste program would be limited to the amount the program spent the
year before. The provisions would eliminate the hundreds of millions of
dollars in surplus fees collected from ratepayers each year that are
scored, or counted against the federal budget.
   Colvin said that doing away with the new railroad spur called for in
H.R. 1020 would save $1-billion. That, coupled with the one-time payments
utilities are required to make to the DOE program, would put the scoring
difference at less than $1-billion, he said.
   He noted that NEI still has a lot more to do in working with the Senate
leadership on fixing the waste program. Sen. Larry Craig's (R-Idaho) S.
1271 is the companion to H.R. 1020 and will be tackled this year.
   Timing will be everything in both chambers. Colvin said NEI is
optimistic about getting a bill through the Senate early in the year,
before the political pressure of the presidential election year gets too
high. He noted there was no magic cutoff point for passing nuclear waste
legislation, but that the longer that effort dragged on the more difficult
it would be.

Increasing Industry Role
   The role the nuclear industry will have in the DOE waste program is
expected to increase in 1996. Colvin said that DOE is expected to issue a
request for proposals early in the year, seeking private sector involvement
or input on spent fuel transportation.
   DOE program director Daniel Dreyfus has noted that budget cuts would
force DOE to turn that work over to the private sector. The department also
will be terminating its multipurpose canister (MPC) program, also leaving
that work up to the private sector.
   Colvin said NEI plans to play a key role in the private-sector
development of spent fuel canisters that can be used to store, ship, and
ultimately bury the waste. NEI will be a key coordinator of work and is
expected to outline utility specifications for the canisters, much like
what the industry did for advanced light water reactor requirements through
the Electric Power Research Institute.
   ``Clearly NEI will have some type of catalyst role,'' said Colvin.

HOLTEC, SIERRA NUCLEAR, AND SEG-VECTRA MAKE MESCALERO PROJECT SHORT LIST

By:
Elaine Hiruo, Washington

   Three dry storage teams made it to the Mescalero project's short list
last month, keeping them in the running as potential suppliers for the
commercial spent fuel storage business planned for Mescalero tribal land in
New Mexico. Final selection is expected early this year.
   On the short list are Holtec International, Sierra Nuclear, and a team
made up of Westinghouse subsidiary SEG and Vectra Technologies Inc.
   A contract with the Mescalero-utility project could open doors
elsewhere. Northern States Power Co. (NSP), for example, is the lead
utility in the project and will only consider storage technologies tapped
for the Mescalero venture when it develops its own away-from-reactor
storage facility.
   Under Minnesota law, the utility must look for sites elsewhere in
Goodhue County, away from the Mississippi River, to store Prairie Island
spent fuel. The plant is in Goodhue County near the river. Jim Alders, NSP
manager of regulatory projects, said last week that the storage capacity at
the away-from-reactor site will be limited to 680 fuel assemblies.
   NSP, he said, expects to receive vendor bids in mid-January and to
select the winning technology by mid-March. The utility plans to submit a
license application to the NRC in October.
   Public opposition, meanwhile, is mounting against attempts to move
Prairie Island spent fuel away from the reactor site. A citizens advisory
group's draft report now circulating recommends that the state scrap plans
for an away-from-reactor storage facility, said Alders. The group is
scheduled to submit its final report to the Minnesota Environmental Quality
Board in mid-January.
   Alders said he did not know if a board decision to leave spent fuel at
Prairie Island would put the issue back in the lap of the Minnesota
legislature.
   Meanwhile, dry storage vendors expect the Mescalero Apache Tribe and its
utility partners to select more than one technology for the spent fuel
storage facility planned for New Mexico. The project is aimed at providing
limited storage relief to participating utilities, which feel they can no
longer rely solely on the faltering DOE nuclear waste program.
   The commercial venture is slated to have enough storage capacity to
handle 20,000 metric tons uranium of spent fuel. It will be built and
operated as a business, with an operating life of no more than 40 years.
   The short-listed companies already have links to utilities participating
in the project. Holtec, for instance, earlier sold its canister-based spent
fuel storage system to Commonwealth Edison, the largest nuclear utility in
the U.S. and a member of the Mescalero project. Sierra Nuclear and Vectra
storage systems, likewise, have been purchased by other project members.

IN MATTER OF YEARS, DOE STANCE SHIFTS FROM `OBLIGATION' TO NO CLEAR LEGAL
DUTY

   In 1984, DOE correspondence on the department's accepting utility spent
fuel in 1998 was peppered with such phrases as ``legal obligations.''
Despite being called for in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and in
contracts DOE signed with utilities, by 1993 those phrases were gone, and
DOE officials maintained they didn't have a clear legal obligation to take
the spent fuel by the 1998 contract date if DOE failed to have a place to
put the waste.
   Attorneys for states and nuclear utilities suing the department over its
1998 responsibility have submitted DOE correspondence to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that appears to show an
evolving policy. Plaintiffs in the case have asked the court to reinforce
what they consider a binding DOE obligation to begin taking utility spent
fuel by January 31, 1998.
   Oral arguments are slated for January 17.
   The following are excerpts from DOE correspondence in the joint appendix
plaintiffs' attorneys filed with the court or in DOE's response to a
Freedom of Information request.

May 30, 1984 letter from DOE General Counsel Theodore Garrish to Sen.
Bennett Johnston (D-La.), ranking Democrat on the Energy & Natural
Resources Committee:
   ``The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 was passed with the presumption
that a repository would be operational by January 31, 1998. The Department
fully intends to meet this congressional objective and is currently in the
process of taking the steps necessary to ensure that we fulfill all of our
corresponding legal obligations under the act....
   ``We believe the intent of Congress when formulating the act was
directed toward commencing disposal operations by 1998. The Department is
totally committed to achieving this objective. In light of this commitment,
we are not now in a position to analyze in any meaningful way the legal
consequences raised by your question as the act was premised upon the
existence of an operational repository by the January 31, 1998 date.''

June 21, 1984 letter from Johnston to Secretary of Energy Donald Hodel:
   ``For some time I have been concerned about the Department's nuclear
waste program. In pursuing this concern I have put several questions to
Departmental spokesmen. Recently I received a rather extraordinary letter
from your General Counsel, Theodore J. Garrish, responding to a request
that I had made of the Department for a memorandum on the Department's
interpretation of certain provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of
1982.
   ``I had asked for an opinion on the legal obligation of the Department
and the Department's authority to take title to spent nuclear fuel in the
event that a repository has not commenced operation. Garrish's reply was as
follows: ``...(W)e are not now in a position to analyze in any meaningful
way the legal consequences raised by your question....
   ``The only sensible interpretation I can put on this response is that
the Department does not want to provide an answer to my question.''

Draft letter, dated June 29, 1984, from Hodel to Johnston [Eric Fygi, DOE
deputy general counsel under the current administration, later said this is
an unused draft of the response Hodel later sent to Johnston on September
7, 1984.]:
   ``My first reaction to your letter was sympathy. Lord knows that many
times I, too, have despaired at getting a `sensible interpretation' out of
the Office of General Counsel. As if that were not enough, the Office of
General Counsel has adopted its own version of the winemaker's adage, under
which `they'll not opine before it's time.'
   ``But as I actually turned to Mr. Garrish's repsonse [sic] of May 30 it
seemed to make a good deal of sense. It emphasized Congress' clear policy
objective that acceptance of spent fuel for disposal would commence by
January 31, 1998. Instead of trying to render a legal opinion in a factual
vacuum, Mr. Garrish's letter advised you, correctly, that the Department is
`totally committed to achieving this objective.'''

August 30, 1984 letter from Garrish to Johnston:
   ``The Department does not intend to breach the legal commitments it has
made in carrying out the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, and, of course, to date
there has been no suggestion that it has defaulted on any of its
obligations. To the contrary, this administration's clear policy commitment
is directed to commencing waste acceptance `beginning in 1998.'...
   ``Since the clear policy commitment made by the Congress in formulating
the Act was directed to beginning repository operations in sufficient time
to commence disposal of spent fuel by 1998, and since the Administration is
committed to achieving precisely that objective, the issues that might be
presented by the unavailability of a repository at that time have an
abstract quality. We are not in a position now to analyze in any meaningful
way the legal consequences of unavailability of a repository wholly bereft
of a real factual setting necessary to aid our understanding of the
question. Section 302(a) (5) contemplates beginning disposal of spent fuel
by January 31, 1998, and the Department is fully committed to achieving
that objective.''

September 7, 1984 letter from Hodel to Johnston:
   ``In our original letter, the Department stated a firm commitment to
accept for disposal, on an orderly schedule, high-level radioactive waste
and spent fuel not (sic) later than January 31, 1998.''

March 12, 1987 letter from DOE General Counsel J. Michael Farrell to Rep.
Philip Sharp (R-Ind.):
   ``(A)cceptance of spent fuel for storage at an MRS (monitored
retrievable storage) facility beginning January 31, 1998 would comply with
the contract requirements that were based on the Nuclear Waste Policy
Act...''
   ``Thus we believe section 302(a) (5) (A) imposes a duty on the Secretary
after commencement of repository operations to take title to spent fuel
promptly on request, but does not foreclose the Secretary from taking title
to spent fuel in advance of commencement of repository operations if that
step is necessary and appropriate in fulfilling the terms of the contract
by which the program is implemented.''

April 1, 1987 letter from Farrell to Sharp:
   ``Had Congress intended in section 302(a) (5) to specify a date by which
a first repository was to begin operations, the logical point at which to
express this policy would have been in that section's subsection that deals
expressly with `commencement of operation of a repository.' Instead, it
refrained from specifying a date certain for commencement of repository
operations, but required only that, once a repository has begun operations,
the Secretary shall act with expedition to take title to spent fuel on the
request of the generator or owner of spent fuel.''

Prehearing questions and answers related to the April 23, 1987 hearing by
the Senate Environment & Public Works Subcommittee on Nuclear Regulation.
Witness: Secretary of Energy John Herrington.
   Q: ``Do you view the MRS facility as either a `disposal' facility or a
facility in which to `dispose' of `spent nuclear fuel?'''
   A: ``No. The MRS is viewed as a DOE facility as defined in Article I 10
of the contract; which would be an integral part of the waste disposal
system. That definition expressly includes a facility to which spent fuel
`may be shipped by DOE prior to its transportation to a disposal facility.'
The purpose of that definition was described in the preamble of the final
rule adopting the contract terms `to expressly state, an accordance with
the act, that there may be an interim storage facility...which DOE may
utilize prior to emplacement in a repository.''

January 12, 1991 letter from DOE waste program director Daniel Dreyfus to
Commissioner Susan Clark of the Florida Public Service Commission:
   ``The Department does not have a clear legal obligation under the
Nuclear Waste Policy Act to accept spent nuclear fuel absent an operational
repository or other facility. However, the Secretary has acknowledged her
belief that the Department may have created such an expectation through its
implementation of the Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel
and/or High-Level Radioactive Waste (10 CFR 961). The Secretary has further
indicated her intention to explore with affected utilities various options
and methods for offsetting a portion of the financial burden associated
with continued onsite storage in order to address expectations resulting
from currently projected waste acceptance schedules.''

December 29, 1993 letter from Dreyfus to Robert Butterworth, Florida state
attorney general:
   ``The Department shares your concern regarding the timely provision of
disposal services for the Nation's spent nuclear fuel. When the Nuclear
Waste Policy Act was enacted in 1982, the Department planned to have a
facility in operation and prepared to begin acceptance of spent nuclear
fuel in 1998. The Department does not have a clear legal obligation under
the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to accept spent nuclear fuel absent an
operations repository or other facility.''

SOUTH CAROLINA STUDIES WASTE FEE OPTIONS

   Concerned about the lack of progress in the DOE civilian high-level
nuclear waste program, South Carolina last month became the third state to
look into withholding nuclear utility ratepayer contributions from the
federal Nuclear Waste Fund. The state Public Service Commission on December
20 approved Commissioner Warren Arthur's motion to establish the review
process. Arthur said the commission is obligated to determine if the waste
fee is in fact a ``prudent expenditure.'' He said that commission staff
will look into such things as the legal aspects, under South Carolina laws,
of withholding the ratepayer payments.
   Arthur said that, in the context of a rate case proceeding, the
commission might later pursue such options as barring utilities from
passing the fee on to ratepayers, or placing that money into a special
escrow account. Arthur said the staff has been asked to present its
preliminary report to the commission February 22. The final report is due
by June 1.
   The Virginia State Corporation Commission (SCC) became the first state
body to request such a study in July 1995. SCC staff was slated to present
the report to the commission late last week. The Minnesota Department of
Public Service (DSC) announced its probe of the fee issue in November. Any
DSC recommendation to change the way the fee is handled would have to be
taken up by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission.

WESTINGHOUSE HANFORD AWARD FEE $1.5-MILLION

   The Westinghouse Hanford Co. received a $1.5-million DOE award fee last
month after receiving a rating of ``good'' for its work at the shuttered
Hanford nuclear arms plant in Washington state. The rating covers the
six-month period ending September 30 and is up from the satisfactory grade
the company received for the previous six months. The maximum award fee
possible for work done during this latest rating period was $5-million.
   The fee is one of several the company can receive, based on the caliber
of its work. Westinghouse Hanford is prime contractor at the DOE site. DOE
said that fiscal 1995 fees awarded to the company as of December 15
included: $11.7-million out of a possible $13.3-million for meeting
performance-based objectives; $9.4-million, based on a claimed savings of
$188-million (DOE said a cost savings validations is under way and is
expected to add to the cost-savings fee.); and $2.6-million out of a
possible $3-million for its handling of solid waste at the site.

HOLTEC WINS RERACKING JOB AT ANGRA-1

   The team of Holtec International and U.S. Tool & Die has received a
contract to install high density spent fuel storage racks at Angra-1 in
Brazil. Value of the deal has been estimated at $6-million. The reracking
will increase the in-pool storage capacity of the Furnas Centrais
Electricas S.A. unit from 363 storage locations to 1,252 slots. Holtec said
the racks are designed to store fuel in two regions of the pool: Region 1
will be designed for storing fresh fuel assemblies, and Region 2 will be
for assemblies taking credit for burnup.

NRC STAFF LOOKS TO FRENCH PROGRAM AS IT REVIEWS DOE WORK ON BURNUP CREDIT

By:
Elaine Hiruo, Washington; Ann MacLachlan, Paris

   NRC staff expects to soon be able to submit questions to DOE on the
department's topical report on burnup credit. When approved, the report
could serve as a valuable reference to dry storage vendors in the U.S.,
according to one DOE official.
   Late last month Charles Haughney, deputy director of the NRC spent fuel
program office, said he believed that DOE was on the road to addressing
issues surrounding the use of burnup credit. Key among them is
criticality.
   ``You really have to take an attitude that a criticality accident in the
public sector is absolutely unacceptable,'' Haughney said. Criticality
already is on NRC's roster of technical issues that must be addressed in
its licensing of such things as the spent fuel containers and the
repository itself.
   Any NRC approval of the DOE topical report is expected to have vendors
scrambling back to the drawing boards to redesign spent fuel baskets
already approved by the NRC. The credit could result in higher capacity
waste packages.
   Burnup credit is not now used in the U.S. Haughney was part of a
two-member NRC team that went to France in November to see how the issue is
handled there. The differences between the more mature French program and
DOE's would prevent any direct shifting of technology and ideas. But
Haughney said the visit left him wondering how some of what the French do
could be adapted to fit within the framework of the U.S. program.
   ``We went over there to get a little smarter, not to find the keys to
the kingdom,'' he said.
   French officials say that as fuel burnups increase, calculating the
residual uranium enrichment of spent fuel precisely can translate into
optimization of transport and consequent cost savings.
   Jean-Louis Ricaud, head of Cogema's reprocessing and engineering
operations, which also includes the Cogema group's transportation business,
said no special burnup credit was needed for fuels with an initial
uranium-235 enrichment of around 3%-3.5%, corresponding to today's standard
burnups of around 35,000 megawatt-days per metric ton. Standard spent fuel
transport casks and especially internal fuel baskets were designed to
prevent criticality accidents for such enrichment levels, he explained.
   But when utilities began moving to higher burnups, requiring initial
enrichments above 3.5%, the French company and its customers sought a
method to give credit for U-235 burnup in a reactor, in order to
demonstrate that spent higher-enrichment fuel does not in fact have a
residual enrichment greater than 3% and thus that no special measures are
required for its transport, such as loading the transport baskets with
fewer fuel elements.
   Ricaud said equipment has been developed to measure the dose rate from
assemblies in the reactor, calculate the fuel's content in fission
products, and deduce the amount of U burned and thus the amount remaining
in the assembly after discharge. The method requires monitoring fuel burnup
in-reactor. Ricaud said he didn't know how widespread the practice is in
France today; Electricite de France is only beginning to move to
higher-burnup fuel.
   Research staff of the Institute of Nuclear Safety and Protection (IPSN)
have participated in the development. IPSN is a semi-autonomous unit of the
Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique (CEA) which works partly for the CEA and
other industry customers, and partly in a safety analysis function for the
French nuclear safety authority, DSIN.
   Ricaud said that following a criticality specialists' meeting in
Albuquerque, N.M. last September, technicians from the CEA and the NRC had
agreed to pursue discussions on burnup credit.
   Ricaud observed that the U.S. situation is ``fundamentally different''
from the French situation, because spent fuel is generally shipped in
France to La Hague after only one or two years' cooling. In the U.S., he
said, fuel cools longer at-reactor, so the capacity of each transport cask
is theoretically higher. An additional margin could be won if credit is
given for burnup in calculating the amount of fuel that can be loaded into
a given basket. But the real problem in the U.S., he said, is that
``there's no place to ship'' the spent fuel.

TOLEDO EDISON BEGINS LOADING THREE NUHOMS MODULES AT DAVIS-BESSE

   Toledo Edison Co., after being cleared by NRC, began the process of
loading three Nuhoms spent fuel storage modules December 26 at Davis-Besse.
The modules, made by Vectra Technologies Inc., will hold 72 assemblies and
allow the utility to maintain a full-core off-load capability when it
enters a refueling outage in April. The utility may need two or more
additional modules in early 1998 (before the next refueling outage) if a
federal interim storage facility is not available, a company spokeswoman
said.
   NRC declined to grant a request from the Toledo Coalition for Safe
Energy to halt the loading of the casks. The Toledo group had one lawsuit
dismissed in November challenging the NRC rule allowing the Nuhoms cask to
be used for spent fuel storage. However,the group November 30 filed a new
lawsuit in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,
claiming that NRC improperly allowed Vectra to alter a safety analysis
report commitment on cask wall thickness (NF, 6 Nov. '95, 17). Joining the
Toledo Coalition in its latest suit is the Maryland Safe Energy Coalition,
which seeks to block the use of Nuhoms modules at Baltimore Gas & Electric
Co.'s Calvert Cliffs.
   Separately, Vectra reported in mid-November a net loss of $1.9-million
for the three months ending October 1 on revenue of $24-million. In the
same period a year ago, the company earned $23,000 on revenue of
$32.5-million.
   In a filing with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission, Vectra said
the revenue decrease was due partially to a decrease in nuclear engineering
services. Vectra President Ray Fortney said the company would have a
stronger fourth quarter.
   In September, the company negotiated a new $3-million loan, which it
says will be sufficient to meet all its commitments through the end of
1995. But the 10Q filing notes that operations in 1995 will not alone
generate sufficient cash to continue operations. But it adds that
``management anticipates that sufficient cash will be provided through
additional reductions in operating expenses, entering into a joint venture
or strategic partnership, or the sale of other assets. The company also
intends to explore alternatives for raising capital through preferred stock
or a rights offering.'' Fortney said he is confident that ``Vectra will be
in business in 1996.''
   Earlier in the year, the company sold its chemical decontamination
business, Plant Services Inc., to Westinghouse for $19-million, less
certain adjustments. Among other things, Vectra used the money to reduce
long-term debt.

USEC SALE SHOULD BE CANCELED, SAYS HARVARD STUDY OF HEU DEAL

By:
Wilson Dizard III

   The planned privatization of the U.S. Enrichment Corp. (USEC) is a bad
deal for the U.S. Treasury and for national security, according to a
forthcoming book by Richard Falkenrath and others of Harvard University's
Center for Science & International Affairs (CSIA).
   Falkenrath's study of the high-enriched uranium (HEU) deal and USEC's
role in it appears as part of Avoiding Nuclear Anarchy: Containing the
Threat of Loose Russian Nuclear Weapons and Fissile Material, to be
published by CSIA this year.
   According to a prepublication copy of the study provided to NuclearFuel,
``The U.S. government could resolve many of the problems with the U.S.
purchase of Russian HEU if it were simply to cancel the privatization of
USEC.
   ``Under this option, USEC would remain the executive agent of the HEU
deal, but the U.S. Treasury would remain USEC's sole owner. As a
government-owned corporation, USEC could be instructed to accept lower
profits for the foreign policy gains associated with the purchase of
Russian HEU--a trade the corporation would resist making if it were owned
by normal, profit maximizing investors.
   ``This solution, of course, would work only so long as the government
exercises more effective oversight of USEC's purchase of HEU from Russia
than was the case in 1994-95.
   ``Canceling the public sale of USEC is a less radical idea than it may
seem. Most if not all of the efficiency gains associated with
private-sector management were achieved in July 1993, when USEC was
established as a government-owned corporation out of the highly inefficient
government enrichment operation run by DOE. Few if any additional
efficiency gains can be expected by transferring the ownership from the
government to the private sector. Indeed, there are at least two reasons
why the public sale of USEC may be a poor choice for the government. The
first reason has already been noted: the White House could compel a
government-owned USEC to accept the lower profits associated with buying
Russian HEU, whereas a publicly owned USEC would resist this pressure.
   ``The second argument against privatizing USEC is that the net present
value of USEC as a government-owned corporation exceeds by a substantial
margin the net expected proceeds of the sale of USEC.''
   Falkenrath's analysis of the costs to USEC of buying Russian material is
based on his view that USEC's production cost for SWU hovers around $60,
compared to the current cost of SWU to USEC under the HEU deal of $82.50.
   The Harvard scholar's view that the sale of USEC will cost the U.S.
government more than it gains is based in part on a study of the
transaction conducted by the General Accounting Office last year (NF, 25
Sept. '95, 1).
   Other enrichment market analysts have raised the point that delaying,
rather than canceling, the sale of USEC could lead to increased revenue for
the U.S. government. Under one privately discussed analysis, the Treasury
would stand to gain as much as $1-billion by delaying the sale of USEC for
one year.

NRC Sees Certification Delay
   Another factor that could impair the privatization of USEC is the recent
announcement by NRC staff that completion of the review of the federal SWU
company's application for safety certification will be delayed by several
weeks.
   NRC's Executive Director for Operations, James Taylor, informed the NRC
commissioners November 28 that the certification schedule was likely to
slip several weeks from the previous completion date of February 29.
   NRC staff asked USEC 1,300 first-round questions about the second safety
certification application the federal SWU corporation submitted on
September 15. The first safety certification application was rejected in
April
   ``USEC has responded to a substantial number of questions,'' Taylor
wrote. ``However, responses to a number of substantive issues have not yet
been received. In addition, it is apparent from discussions with USEC that
certain issues raised by the staff's questions will not be easily resolved.
For example, the staff believes that substantial improvements are needed in
USEC's proposed technical safety requirements, particularly those needed to
ensure protection of workers from death or serious injuries from potential
uranium hexafluoride accidents.''
   Taylor said NRC staff would brief the commission before making a
decision on certification. He made his comments in Secy 95-279, ``Status of
Certification of the USEC Gaseous Diffusion Plants.''
   Separately, USEC announced that it has hired Donald Hatcher as director
of risk management. Hatcher will oversee insurance programs at USEC.

MINATOM EXPECTS EURATOM HEU DEAL; STATE DEPT. WON'T INTERVENE ON FRM-2

By:
Mark Hibbs, Moscow; Michael Knapik, Washington

   The Ministry of Atomic Energy (Minatom) for the Russian Federation and
the European Union (EU) have begun negotiations over supply of weapon-grade
high-enriched uranium (HEU) to the Euratom Supply Agency (ESA) and may soon
conclude an agreement, Moscow officials confirmed last month.
   According to an aide to Minatom head Viktor Mikhailov, negotiations on
supply of HEU for research reactor fuel to ESA might be concluded by late
January. The aide added, however, that scheduling and other details could
push back a final agreement until sometime in February.
   Diplomatic sources in Moscow said that so far Minatom had not attached
any ``unusual restrictions'' on the supply of the HEU to Euratom beyond
requiring the usual peaceful-use commitments. Accordingly, HEU supplied by
Minatom to ESA would be fungible under the terms of a peaceful-use
agreement, and it will be up to ESA to determine how the material would be
distributed.
   The sources said that, also conforming with usual practice for
peaceful-use agreements, Minatom would specify that HEU it supplied is
intended for use in research reactor fuel and would expect to receive a
list of where Euratom intends to store, process, and irradiate the
material.
   German opponents to the FRM-2 materials test reactor project, planned to
be built by the Technical University of Munich, have said the Russian HEU
would effectively relieve pressure from the U.S. to convert the reactor to
use low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel.
   Following up high-level talks in September between Secretary of Energy
Hazel O'Leary and German IAEA representative Cornelia Yzer, U.S. and German
officials are expected to meet in Garching in mid-January to discuss the
prospects for building the FRM-2 with a slightly larger power rating and a
core using lower-enriched uranium. DOE hopes to see Germany agree to
re-design FRM-2 to use fuel proposed by the Reduced Enrichment for Research
and Test Reactor (RERTR) program. Argonne National Laboratory unilaterally
produced such a redesign last year at a meeting of the RERTR program
participants, raising protests from the FRM-2 sponsors and constructor
Siemens (NF, 25 Sept. '95, 7).

No State Department Action
   After the U.S. Department of State asked Germany to confirm a report
that Minatom and ESA had agreed to supply HEU for research reactors (NF, 25
Sept. '95, 7), diplomatic sources speculated that the State Department
would intervene--either to persuade Russia not to consummate a deal that
would challenge U.S. nonproliferation policy, or to request assurances from
ESA that FRM-2 would not be supplied Russian-origin HEU.
   But a senior U.S. official said last week that the State Department
would not take any action with Moscow. The official suggested that as long
as the U.S. is using HEU in some research reactors, U.S. objections to
FRM-2 running on the material are not credible. In the past this argument
has been pushed by European operators, who have said they are disadvantaged
commercially by the continued use of HEU in the U.S.
   Other U.S. officials say that the German desk at the State Department
has determined that proliferation concern about using HEU in FRM-2 is a
low-priority issue in U.S.-German affairs.

GAN IN NO POSITION TO TAKE RUSSIAN PHYSICAL INVENTORY

By:
Mark Hibbs, Moscow

   Gosatomnadzor (GAN), the agency appointed by President Boris Yeltsin to
watch over Russia's nuclear materials, has neither the means nor the
political clout to carry out a comprehensive material balance inventory,
Russian officials said last month.
   Yuri Volodin, head of the department of safeguards at GAN, said that
inspectors have been able to do only ``book audits'' based on data already
collected by operators of facilities under the control of the Ministry of
Atomic Energy (Minatom). In addition to the audits, GAN personnel can
conduct ``problem checks'' of data, to see how a facility operator obtains
and processes the information.
   ``In a few cases,'' Volodin said, facility operators ``measured
canisters for us,'' to verify the amounts of material declared to GAN. ``We
have been everywhere and seen everything, but not much of the inventory has
been verified,'' he said.
   There is no central data bank at Minatom or GAN for inventories of
nuclear material. GAN officials said that inventory data are in the hands
of plant operators. The only reporting obligation plant management has to
central authorities in Moscow, one official said, is an ``annual request''
by the Ministry of Finance to report on the production of materials for
customs purposes. GAN does not know whether Minatom facilities routinely
comply with those reporting requests, he said.
   GAN staffers complain that the agency has never seen some sensitive
inventory data that Minatom passed on to the U.S. DOE in mid-1995. That
information was given to the U.S. as part of a bilateral agreement related
to the transfer of weapon-grade uranium to the U.S. and the disposition of
Russian plutonium.
   There are also no plans at GAN to conduct a comprehensive physical
inventory in Russia. Volodin said that such an effort would require
technical means, political authority, and funding that is out of his
agency's reach. The cost of new equipment needed to take a complete
physical inventory would be about $6-million. GAN has nearly no resources
at all and is routinely two to three weeks behind in paying staffers, he
said.
   To meet payroll and routine expenses for the last several months of
1995, the central government had to scrape to find an extra 300-million
rubles (about $60,000 at current exchange rates). For safeguards efforts at
DOE or Euratom, Volodin said, ``this amount would be a pittance.''
   But it paid about 30 safeguards inspectors located in four Russian
regions that GAN has staffed up during the 24 months since Yeltsin made GAN
responsible for nuclear materials accounting. Permanent on-site inspectors
have been assigned to bulk-handling facilities at Tomsk-7, Krasnoyarsk-26,
Chelyabinsk-65, and Sverdlovsk-44.
   Regional centers have been set up in St. Petersburg for northeastern
Russia (Northern Fleet naval fuel inventories in Severodvinsk, all
RMBK-design reactors, and St. Petersburg research institutions); in
Novosibirsk for Siberia (11 fuel cycle processing facilities, including
Tomsk-7, Krasnoyarsk-26, and Angarsk; plus a uranium mining operation in
Chita); and Ekaterinburg for the Urals (fuel processing plants in
Sverdlovsk-44 and Chelyabinsk-65).

Naval Fuel Accounting Deficiencies
   A fourth regional center for the Far East is also being set up in
Khabarovsk, centering on the Komsomolsk shipyard at the mouth of the Amur
River. Officials said that GAN had gotten enough access to fuel assembly
operations for the Pacific Fleet to have determined that there is ``no
input control, no quality control for nuclear material, no check of the
quantity of material in single cores, and no accounting system'' during
preparation of naval propulsion fuel, another Russian official said.
   Through the St. Petersburg center, GAN is working with the Murmansk
Shipping Co. and the German firm Gesellschaft fuer Anlagen- und
Reaktorsicherheit mbH (GRS) to improve physical protection and accounting
measures for nuclear fuels associated with Russian icebreakers and other
non-military vessels.
   While Yeltsin at the outset had put GAN in charge of accounting for all
Russian nuclear materials, in October 1994 Yeltsin stripped GAN of
responsibility for military inventories and production facilities.
   Volodin downplayed the impact of the Yeltsin decision, calling it a
``relief'' that served to clarify questions about GAN's access and
eliminate a conflict point between GAN, Minatom, and the Ministry of
Defense (MOD). But other officials complained that Minatom had pressed
Yeltsin to keep GAN out of military activities. Minatom ``plays all kinds
of political games in Moscow'' to deny GAN funds and authority, another GAN
inspector complained. ``The basic problem we have is that Minatom just
doesn't believe in the need for an independent safeguards agency.''
   Just before Yeltsin cut off GAN's access to military activities, this
official elaborated, MOD had begun to work with GAN and had appointed a
representative on a joint committee to organize safeguards activities at
defense-related facilities. Now, MOD itself is in sole charge of safeguards
at these sites. GAN officials said that MOD, unlike GAN, does not have a
set of procedures for accounting for weapon-grade uranium and plutonium,
however. In the meantime, MOD has assured GAN that it will get complete
access to disarmament materials, once they are broken down from weapons
components.
   Minatom officials objected that, in the U.S., NRC also has no safeguards
access to defense-related materials. But GAN staffers replied that DOE,
unlike Minatom, has a complex defense material accounting and control
system that relies heavily on established safeguards practices.

Plutonium MUF Problems
   One result of Yeltsin's October 1994 ``clarification'' is that GAN has
been told it has access in principle to all inventories of UO2 and PuO2,
including those produced by defense-related facilities, officials said.
   According to Volodin, GAN's access is blocked once oxides are processed
into metal form. A discussion is underway between Minatom and GAN about the
point where GAN must forfeit access and the material becomes categorized as
defense material, Volodin said. ``But we have access to all the PuO2 stored
at all the reprocessing plants,'' he said.
   Regardless of access in principle to PuO2 inventories, lack of proper
equipment has prevented GAN and Minatom so far from accurately measuring
and verifying plutonium inventories at bulk-handling facilities. This has
contributed to a significant estimate of material unaccounted for (MUF) in
process inventories at the RT-1 reprocessing plant at Chelyabinsk-65
(Ozersk), for example, officials said.
   Surge tanks at RT-1 have a ring geometry that, one GAN official said,
prevents plutonium in solution from settling homogeneously, causing
significant reliability problems. In addition, the accuracy of equipment
used at RT-1 to weigh samples of material is only plus or minus 5 grams per
each 3-kilogram sample.
   The point of departure for Minatom's calculation of initial inventory at
any bulk-handling facility is the estimated amount of U-235 in fresh fuel
feedstocks. GAN has access to historical records of these estimates, but,
officials said, Minatom never used non-destructive or destructive analysis
to verify the estimates. The only reliable plutonium inventory figures
available for reprocessing plants are for the plutonium output itself,
which can be determined analytically.
   Independently of the battles over authority, GAN officials said that, at
the facility level, plant management is very cooperative with their efforts
to assess inventories. According to fuel cycle plant officials, however,
cooperation would be less if facilities were operating at Western capacity
factors. RT-1 last year ran at about 30% of design throughput. ``We have
plenty of time to show the inspectors around,'' said chief engineer Evgeny
Dzekun.

WITHOUT EC ASSURANCES, NRC MOVES TO SUSPEND COMPONENT EXPORTS

By:
Michael Knapik, Washington; Ann MacLachlan, Paris; Mark Hibbs, Bonn

   A jurisdictional dispute between the European Commission and certain
member states prevented Euratom from giving the U.S. legal assurances
required for certain nuclear reactor and fuel component exports before the
expiration of the U.S.-Euratom agreement for cooperation on December 31.
   As a result, the U.S. NRC was in the process, as NuclearFuel went to
press December 28, of suspending the general and specific licenses (those
licenses referred to as XCOM and XMAT) to export reactor components, heavy
water, and nuclear-grade graphite to all Euratom countries except Spain,
Sweden, and Finland. NRC's action could cost several companies
``potentially millions of dollars,'' said one agency staffer.
   A senior EC official said December 28 that member states are examining
two solutions but that neither would be in place when the original
U.S.-Euratom agreement expires, and with it the validity of the existing
letters of assurance.
   The list of so-called non-major or non-sensitive components is contained
in items five through nine of Appendix A to 10 CFR Part 110. The items
include pressure tubes, zirconium tubes, such reactor internals as core
support structures, and reactor control drive mechanisms. Among the
companies most affected by the suspension are Siemens--which imports
zirconium tubes from the U.S. and has a large fuel fabrication business in
the U.S.--and Carpenter Technology, sources said.
   European Commission staff had hoped that an interim solution could be
worked out to avoid an interruption of trade in the affected items on
December 31. They had aimed at an ``interim measure'' under which the
Commission would have made the necessary assurances on behalf of European
Union (EU) member countries, while preparing a permanent exchange of
letters--to be submitted for formal approval by the European Council--that
would take effect with the new U.S.-Euratom agreement in the spring (NF, 18
Dec. '95, 8).
   Sources said, however, that France and Britain objected to the
Commission making the assurances on their behalf, because they touch areas
in which the Commission does not have jurisdiction, or shares it with
member states. This is notably the case for the assurance that the exported
items will be used for peaceful purposes only, since defense is a national
prerogative in the EU today.
   Pressed by Siemens, the German government approached the U.S. about
delivering a separate set of assurances so that exports could continue to
Germany. That solution became less attractive, however, when the Germans
were told that with such bilateral assurances, German companies could not
transfer the exported components to another country within Euratom without
U.S. consent.
   In addition to control over retransfers, the U.S. requires countries to
give assurances that the components will be under IAEA safeguards and will
be used for peaceful purposes. In the U.S., the fact that the new
assurances have not been given was described as ``disturbing and
mystifying,'' by a senior administration official.
   The assurances are necessary to satisfy U.S. law--which many Europeans
apparently find just as mystifying. The non-major components and materials
are not covered by the U.S.-Euratom agreement, which contains similar
assurances covering more sensitive nuclear materials, equipment and
technology. But the 1978 Nuclear Nonproliferation Act required
peaceful-use, safeguards and retransfer-approval assurances on the
non-sensitive items, too--hence the need for separate assurances covering
them.
   The current generic component assurances, given in 1979, are tied to the
expiring U.S.-Euratom agreement, although they are not a part of it.
   The U.S. entered into separate agreements with Sweden, Spain, and
Finland before they became members of Euratom. As a result, nuclear exports
can continue to those countries under the individual agreements, even in
the absence of any agreement between the U.S. and Euratom.

Authority Of EC Assurances Challenged
   One source following the U.S.-Euratom saga in Brussels said that the
Commission had produced a draft assurance package and submitted it to EU
country ambassadors at their regular meeting December 22. But certain EU
states maintain that the Commission does not have the authority to make the
required commitments. ``They can't make a peaceful-use commitment for us,''
said a French official. ``That's the prerogative of member states.''
   Worse, said one industry official, EU states didn't know there had been
an exchange of letters between the Commission and the U.S. government in
1979, containing such commitments on behalf of the states, until last July,
when the Commission was forced to make the old letters public in the course
of EU debate on the new Euratom-U.S. agreement for cooperation.
   The discovery that the Commission had unilaterally agreed to the U.S.
conditions in 1979 added to the tension surrounding the intra-Community
negotiation of the U.S.-Euratom text, member state sources said.
   ``We were astonished when we discovered the existence of that exchange
of letters,'' said an attorney for a major French nuclear company.
   The senior Commission official acknowledged that in fact the European
Council--the EU's collective political leadership--had been informed
officially of the existing exchange only at the beginning of November. And
a check following the protests of member states last summer turned up ``no
trace of a report to the Council'' in 1979, when the initial exchange was
accomplished, or since then, he said.
   The EC official said the history of the commitments was still unclear,
but ``it's possible it was considered as a measure for management of the
(U.S.-Euratom) agreement'' at the time. Such management measures can be
taken without the Council's approval.
   ``Obviously, that didn't improve the atmosphere'' between the Commission
and member states, which have criticized the Commission's negotiation of
the U.S.-Euratom agreement, the Commission official acknowledged. It also
didn't help, he said, that the matter was put before the EU ambassadors
``under pressure'' right before the Christmas break. ``People got a bit
irritated,'' the official said, and an agreement could not be found.
   French vendors aren't very affected by the Section 109b assurances,
industry sources said, because they export very few such components from
the U.S. But they are worried about the principles involved in the
assurances.
   One attorney for a French vendor, who appeared to believe there was
still some leeway in U.S. law to permit an alternative to the blanket
assurance letters, said he wondered if it would be simpler to provide
assurances case-by-case on affected components or materials destined for
export from the U.S. The industry does not like the fact that the letters
of assurance also list countries to which U.S.-origin components may be
freely re-exported, he said.

German Industry Sought Action
   According to a German fuel cycle official, German industry pressed the
German Foreign Ministry to submit independent assurances to the U.S.
``after it became clear that (the EU) would not act in time'' to prevent an
interruption in bilateral commerce.
   The German official said that difficulties had arisen during negotiation
of a ``consensus text'' of the letters among Euratom parties, noting the
objections by France and Britain related to their status as nuclear weapon
states. The official also said that German representatives had had
difficulty demonstrating to Euratom ``just how serious our situation is.''
   As of mid-December, he said, Bonn had been assured that the U.S.
Department of State would take action on the letter submitted by Germany.
   The official said that in anticipation of a December 31 cutoff, Siemens
had succeeded in stockpiling U.S.-origin zirconium in Germany for later use
in manufacturing fuel assemblies. But the company did not manage to arrange
for advance production and delivery of all UO2 fuel assemblies under
contract with European customers through the first few months of 1996, nor
in stockpiling enough UO2 to manufacture assemblies using its limited
capacity available in Germany.
   The EC official said the Commission and member states are considering
two alternatives: either a complete set of bilateral assurances, such as
those proposed by Germany, but only provided any potential obstacle to
intra-Community trade is removed; or ``collective assurances'' that would
be given by the Commission and member states together, ``each one according
to his jurisdiction.''
   Whatever is decided, an interruption in trade in the nonsensitive
materials and components is inevitable and will likely last for several
weeks, until the EU can formally approve a new set of assurance letters.

DOE POSTPONES DECISION ON ALTERNATIVE FOR TAKING BACK RESEARCH REACTOR
FUEL

By:
Michael Knapik, Washington

   Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary apparently decided December 22 not to
decide on a preferred alternative for dealing with about 22,000 spent fuel
elements of U.S.-origin fuel that have been used at non-U.S. research
reactors around the world. Sources said O'Leary wants some more analysis
from her staff.
   The fact that selection of a preferred alternative for DOE's final
environmental impact statement (EIS) was again delayed would typically be
criticized by advocates of those foreign research reactors facing a spent
fuel storage crisis. Instead, the non-decision was greeted with a sigh of
relief by those sources because, in their opinion, DOE was about to decide
on an alternative that would be ineffective, be open to legal challenge by
Greenpeace, and be fatal to the U.S.'s reduced enrichment in research and
test reactor (RERTR) program.
   Those points were made in a December 20 letter to O'Leary by Howard
Shapar, who along with Joseph Egan has provided legal assistance to a group
of 17 foreign research reactor operators--a group put together by Edlow
International--that have spent fuel covered by the EIS. Shapar told O'Leary
that he learned her staff was leaning toward an option that would have
forced operators in countries with a nuclear waste program to send their
fuel to the U.K's Dounreay plant for reprocessing. DOE would sign a
memorandum of understanding with the U.K. under which Dounreay would, in
the future, begin reprocessing low-enriched spent fuel. Reactors operating
temporarily on high-enriched fuel would have to down-blend to LEU with DOE
paying the cost of down-blending. DOE would reprocess the remainder of the
fuel at its Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina except for Triga
fuel, which would be shipped to the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory.
   This option, Shapar said, ``would send a strong signal to the foreign
research reactor community that DOE has abandoned the RERTR program for all
but a few select reactors.'' He mentioned that government authorities in
Sweden and Denmark, and probably in Norway, will not allow reactor
operators in those countries to pursue the Dounreay option, ``largely for
political reasons.'' DOE, Shapar said, will have stranded these countries
with no alternative other than shutdown and/or HEU dry storage.
   Other operators, Shapar said, will stop efforts to convert their
reactors. ``They will not now expend millions of dollars on conversion,''
Shapar said, ``in the hope that DOE's MOU with Britain will produce an LEU
reprocessing stream at Dounreay by the time they are ready to ship their
LEU spent fuel. Instead, they will maintain operations on HEU fuel and
avail themselves of a certain HEU reprocessing stream, with reliance on
Russian HEU.''
   Shapar went on to note that Greenpeace, which is opposed to reprocessing
at Dounreay, would likely sue DOE ``for failing to consider the
extraterritorial impacts of its actions in the U.K.''
   Shapar said DOE should decide to bring all of the spent fuel (except the
Triga fuel) to Savannah River. ``Given DOE's recent decisions to keep one
of the reprocessing canyons open at the SRS...it is unlikely that the
state's congressional delegation will oppose taking the foreign research
fuel back,'' Shapar said. The governor of South Carolina could sue, ``but
we believe that to be very winnable litigation,'' Shapar said.

RT-1 OPERATION FACES COST CRISIS, UNCERTAIN FUTURE DEMAND SCHEDULE

By:
Mark Hibbs, Moscow

   A senior official at the Russian Federation Ministry of Atomic Energy
(Minatom) said last month that prices for reprocessing services at the RT-1
separation plant at Ozersk must be raised to justify further operation.
   Evgeny Dzekun, chief engineer at RT-1, told NuclearFuel that the
reprocessing plant, designed to handle a throughput of 400 metric tons
heavy metal (MTHM) of spent fuel from VVER-440 reactors, naval reactors,
and fast reactors, is currently allowed by local authorities to reprocess
up to 250 MTHM/yr spent fuel.
   During 1995, however, RT-1 handled far less than that amount, and in
1996 it will process still less spent fuel, officials in Moscow said last
month. Ozersk was earlier known as Chelyabinsk-65.
   Dzekun said that between 150 and 180 MT of spent fuel were reprocessed
at RT-1 in 1995. According to information from other Minatom fuel cycle
officials, the total was closer to 150 MT. At average discharge burnups for
VVER-440 fuel of 20,000-25,000 megawatt-days/MT, about 0.8% of the
recovered output is plutonium. Since Dzekun said that the amount of fresh
plutonium added to the stockpile at Ozersk during 1995 was just over 1 MT,
no more than about 150 MT of spent fuel could have been handled there,
these experts said.
   Dzekun had said previously that, up to 1990, the historical average
throughput at RT-1 was about 200 MT/yr; in 1991, he said, 170 MT was
reprocessed, and in 1992, 120 MT (NF, 4 Jan. '93, 4).
   Russia's overall economic situation, and the failure of nuclear power
plants to be paid for power they produce (Nucleonics Week, 7 Dec. '95, 1),
meant that plant management ``can no longer pay for reprocessing,'' Dzekun
said.

U.S. `Interference'
   Dzekun also claimed that U.S. government interference posed a threat to
his reprocessing operation, and he blamed Washington for persuading VVER
reactor management outside Russia to opt for dry storage of spent fuel.
   Officials in Finland, Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic all have
felt diplomatic pressure from the U.S. not to reprocess any more VVER fuel,
he said.
   Last month, under terms of a commercial contract with Finland's IVO, the
latest annual shipment of spent fuel from the Loviisa VVERs to Ozersk
occurred. The Finns are still considering whether to ship spent fuel to
RT-1 in 1996 (NF, 18 Dec. '95, 15). Dzekun said that, contrary to claims by
environmental groups, safety will not be a factor in Finland's decision.
Both IVO and regulator STUK have surveyed the RT-1 reprocessing operation
and found it ``safe and reliable.'' However, IVO can send the fuel to the
storage facility being built by Finland's other nuclear utility, TVO.
   In both 1994 and 1995, RT-1 took delivery of spent fuel from the Paks
VVER station in Hungary under a spent fuel takeback deal signed in 1994.
Dzekun said that Paks management has decided in principle to continue
reprocessing spent fuel at RT-1 in 1996 but that it is ``intimidated'' by
the consequences of Russian nuclear law, passed in mid-1995. The law
obliges RT-1's foreign clients to take back high-level reprocessing waste
(HLW) in vitrified form after 25 years of interim storage.
   Hungary ``must take this into consideration if it wants to keep
reprocessing,'' he said. GEC-Alsthom is building a vault-type spent fuel
storage facility for the Paks Nuclear Power Plant that Dzekun suggested
could be licensed to contain HLW.

Reprocessing Cost Inflation
   Dzekun said that, every three months, the cost of inputs for RT-1
reprocessing operations are adjusted upward because of continuing Russian
inflation and market price reforms.
   Real prices for electricity, chemicals, equipment, and transportation
have reached near-Western levels, he said, while RT-1 is tied to premarket
contracts and is not able to pass these increased costs on to customers.
``We will have to raise the price of reprocessing to Russian reactors to
continue justifying operation of the plant,'' Dzekun said. Dzekun said that
he was holding talks with Russian VVER plant managers in an effort to
``persuade'' them to pay more for reprocessing services.
   Dzekun would not reveal the price that VVER-440 stations in Russia pay
for reprocessing. According to unconfirmed reports from other Minatom
sources, however, in some cases reactor management pays as little as $50
per kilogram heavy metal (kgHM), compared to European reprocessors' going
rate of about $1,000/kgMH.
   Similar to steps taken by Cogema to hang on to its German reprocessing
clients (NF, 4 July '94, 1), Minatom will offer VVER-440 reactors a
``package deal'' involving an array of fuel cycle services, including fuel
fabrication, along with higher reprocessing prices, Moscow officials said.
   One senior Russian fuel cycle official qualified that because Minatom
has dropped the VVER-440 from its nuclear energy development plan, ``the
real issue for RT-1 is who its clients will be'' in the future.
   In the meantime, the RT-1 client base is expected to shrink further.
Minatom plans to decommission soon after 2000 the country's older VVER-440
reactors, including Kola-1 and -2, and Novovoronezh-3 and -4. These units
reprocess their spent fuel at Ozersk. Dzekun ``must convince foreign
clients to keep reprocessing'' to keep RT-1 operating, according to an aide
to Minatom head Viktor Mikhailov.
   The aide speculated that an alternative strategy would be to put RT-1 to
work on the huge inventory of spent fuel from the Russian Navy icebreaker
and submarine fleet. But he said that neither Minatom nor the Ministry of
Defense can fund major management of Russia's daunting propulsion reactor
fuel inventory.
   Evgeny Mikerin, head of Minatom's fuel cycle operations, said that
reprocessing of UO2-based icebreaker fuel at RT-1 poses no technical
challenges, but that a large inventory of spent icebreaker fuel presently
stored near Murmansk would be ``difficult to transport'' to Ozersk.
Uranium-zirconium fuels used in submarine reactors, Mikerin said, are
difficult to reprocess there.
   Dzekun also would not disclose prices paid by RT-1's foreign clients.
But Mikerin said that speculation that Hungary pays only about $200/kgHM
for reprocessing services is false. Mikerin said that both the Paks VVER
station and IVO are paying ``somewhat less'' than the Western price, adding
that the rates charged foreign clients are consistent with Minatom's policy
of slightly undercutting market prices.
   According to unconfirmed reports from other Moscow sources, IVO pays
about $700/kgHM for RT-1 reprocessing.
   At present, about 28 MT of separated plutonium from RT-1 VVER
reprocessing operations are stored at Ozersk, Dzekun reported. A little
more than 1 MT was added in 1995. Minatom will continue to stockpile the
plutonium there, he said, in anticipation of BN-800 fast reactors being
built at the Beloyarsk and South Urals sites--the latter adjacent to
RT-1--to absorb the material later as MOX fuel.
   According to Mikerin, however, no funding is allocated for BN-800
construction, and the units will not be built until sometime in the next
century.
   Three years ago, Dzekun said, reprocessing-related operations at
Chelyabinsk-65 employed about 18,000 people. Now the complex provides work
for 14,000; the other 4,000 employees have left for commercial work
elsewhere in the formerly closed city.

REPROCESSING CRITICS SAY MAYAK WILL DIE WITHOUT FOREIGN BUSINESS

By:
Ann MacLachlan, Paris

   Official Russian recognition that the RT-1 reprocessing plant at Ozersk
is fighting for its future confirms predictions made by reprocessing
critics last year.
   In companion papers submitted to the recent Global 95 conference in
Versailles, Anatoly Diakov of the Moscow Institute of Physics & Technology,
and Oleg Bukharin of Princeton University, argued that without reprocessing
business from Hungary and Finland, paid for in hard currency, RT-1 ``would
be completely unprofitable,'' as Diakov put it.
   Ironically, Bukharin pointed out that the existing backlog of naval
spent fuel and submarine dismantlement--amounting to up to 350 submarine
reactor cores' worth of spent fuel within a few years--would provide enough
work for RT-1's naval fuel processing line for ``tens of years,'' even at
100% capacity. But ``this work does not add to the plant's revenues,''
Bukharin said, since the fees paid to RT-1 operator Mayak by the Navy and
the icebreaker fleet only cover production costs. He added that the Navy is
having trouble finding even that amount, independent of the problem of
shipping the spent cores.
   Reprocessing of HEU fuel, Bukharin said, is not favored by Mayak because
it must be funded by Minatom (the Russian Ministry for Atomic Energy) and
is actually a drag on Mayak's own budget.
   Bukharin reviewed the situation with operators of VVER-440 reactors in
Russia and abroad, concluding that economic difficulties in Ukraine and
Bulgaria would diminish the economic value of any spent fuel takeback
arrangements with reactors there. As for VVER-440 operators in central
Europe and Finland, they are gradually moving toward alternative
arrangements, in light of Minatom's high reprocessing fees and the new
requirement for returning waste to reprocessing customers.
   ``Reprocessing of foreign spent fuel has become the principal source of
revenues for Mayak,'' Bukharin said, but those revenues ``cannot be assured
in the future....The loss of the foreign contracts would likely undermine
Mayak's reprocessing business.''
   Recently, Minatom officials--like some of their counterparts in the
West--have attempted to sell future reprocessing operations at RT-1 as part
of a global disarmament and waste management strategy involving mixed-oxide
fuel use and, potentially, advanced techniques of actinide incineration.
   Even if Mayak stopped processing spent fuel soon, Russia would still
have a weapons plutonium inventory of 125 metric tons--an amount destined
to grow in the future as plutonium is separated out from nuclear weapons
components--and a civilian stockpile totaling 72 MT, excluding plutonium
contained in about 8,000 MT of spent fuel stored at reactor sites,
according to Diakov's figures. As of October 1994, all newly produced
plutonium is supposed to be stored in oxide form. High-level Minatom
officials have argued that this plutonium represents a ``national
treasure'' whose use as fuel must be promoted.
   But Diakov argued that technical difficulties, including reactor design,
costs and licensing requirements, would foreclose the introduction of MOX
fuels in Russia's VVER-1000 reactor fleet. Minatom has essentially no
experience burning MOX in LWRs, an argument used by breeder reactor
enthusiasts to promote the recycling of plutonium in fast reactors instead
of LWRs (NF, 9 Oct. '95, 6).
   Diakov, however, contends that the high cost of MOX in a breeder
strategy also would kill that option. He cited an estimated cost of
$765-million for a new BN-800 fast reactor at Beloyarsk and a
multimillion-dollar cost for the so-called Shop 300 plutonium fuel
fabrication plant at Ozersk. An additional three BN-800 units planned for
the South Urals site, near the Mayak complex, would cost $3-billion, he
said.
   Diakov--a well-known opponent of reprocessing and bete noire of
Minatom--said that the nuclear ministry had requested $85-million as part
of its fiscal 1995 program to support a program for transforming ex-weapons
plutonium into MOX fuel. But as of last June 30, the ministry had received
less than 10% of the funds, he said.
   Another potential obstacle is Russia's new nuclear legislation, which
imposes more stringent environmental standards and consequently complicates
licensing of new fuels.
   Because of ``Russia's current chaotic political and economical
condition,'' the Moscow researcher wrote, ``it is unlikely that plans for
Pu utilization will be carried out soon.''
   Moreover, Diakov said, Minatom is not enthusiastic about non-reactor
options for plutonium disposition, such as vitrifying the material, which
it perceives as unsafe.
   Diakov predicted that ``in the next several decades...there will be no
plutonium use in Russia.'' For one thing, Russia's uranium production
capability can support 100 gigawatts of installed reactor capacity, while
the country has only 22 GW. For another, its stockpiles of high-enriched
uranium and uranium enrichment tails are estimated at 1,200 metric tons and
300,000 MT, respectively. Finally, Diakov said, Minatom has about
15-million SWU worth of enrichment capacity and the potential to fabricate
4%-enriched uranium fuel from 0.3% tails at a cost of $540 per kilogram.
   ``It is clear there is no economical motivation for Russia's nuclear
industry to reprocess spent fuel or use plutonium for fuel fabrication,''
he said. Diakov argued that the real question is whether Russia's nuclear
business will take a short- or long-term view of the plutonium disposition
issue. He noted that the main concern is ``to prevent diversion and reuse
of weapons-grade material in new weapons.''
   Rather than seek new uses for plutonium, Diakov contended, the Russian
government should ally with the U.S. to ``make a determined effort to set
up a reciprocal regime of plutonium storage under bilateral or
international control.''

NONPROLIFERATION, SPENT FUEL HANDLING KEY TO LWR SUPPLY CONTRACT WITH DPRK

By:
Kathleen Hart, Washington

   Under a supply contract signed between the Korean Peninsula Energy
Development Organization (KEDO) and North Korea in New York December 15,
KEDO will be responsible for providing fuel to and handling spent fuel from
the two light water reactors promised to Pyongyang.
   North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations, Ho Jon, and KEDO
Executive Director Stephen Bosworth signed the agreement following long and
difficult negotiations that began in Kuala Lumpur in September and resumed
October 16 in New York City. While the contract leaves many details about
the reactor deal unanswered, it paves the way for a possible
ground-breaking at the reactor site in North Korea as early as April, a
source close to the talks said.
   KEDO will finance the $4.5-billion reactor project. It still must enter
into a prime contract; select a ``program coordinator,'' as the
architect/engineer is being called; and finish the site characterization
underway at Sinpo. The Korean Electric Power Corp. is expected to be the
prime contractor, with a number of subcontractors. The supply contract says
that the program coordinator is to be a U.S. firm. The contract for program
coordinator is expected to be awarded based on open competition, with a
request for proposals going out in January or February, said one source
close to the talks. The contract calls for completion of the two reactors
by 2003.
   The contract specifies that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK) will continue the freeze on its 5-MW research reactor and refrain
from building the two larger reactors that were planned, as well as
continue to cooperate in safely storing and canning the spent fuel from the
research reactor, Dan Poneman said at a news briefing in Washington, D.C.
on December 15. Poneman is senior director for nonproliferation and export
controls at the National Security Council.
   KEDO was established in March by the U.S., the Republic of Korea, and
Japan to finance the cost of constructing two 1,000-MW reactors promised to
North Korea under the October 1994 Agreed Framework between the U.S. and
North Korea. The Clinton administration negotiated the agreement to address
the nuclear weapons proliferation threat posed by the DPRK.
   The supply contract says that KEDO will provide nuclear fuel for the
initial loading of each LWR and then will assist the DPRK in obtaining LWR
fuel, other than that provided in the initial loading, through commercial
contracts. KEDO and the DPRK are to cooperate to ensure safe storage of
spent fuel. ``If requested by KEDO, the DPRK must relinquish any ownership
rights over the LWR spent fuel and agree to the transfer of the spent fuel
out of the DPRK through commercial contracts,'' a KEDO statement said.

Contract Prohibits Reprocessing
   Under the contract, the DPRK agrees to apply IAEA safeguards to the LWR
project. North Korea also agrees not to reprocess or increase the
enrichment level of any nuclear material used in or produced through the
use of any reactor or nuclear material transferred in connection with the
reactor project.
   KEDO officials insist that no target date has been set for the
ground-breaking, because there are still many uncertainties surrounding the
project. That decision will depend on the findings of the site
characterization teams and on the timetable for completion of the other
contracts and protocols that KEDO needs to negotiate.
   KEDO sent a third site characterization team to the survey area near
Sinpo City in South Hamgyong Province on December 16. The 15-member team
plans to remain in North Korea for a month, during which time it will
gather information for a topographical map and prepare boring work for the
next step of the site survey, KEDO officials said.
   Of the estimated $4.5-billion cost to construct the two reactors, it is
expected that South Korea will contribute about $3-billionz, Japan about
$1-billion, and the U.S. and other KEDO members about $500,000, plus the
cost of continuing shipments of heavy fuel oil promised to North Korea in
the agreedment, one source noted. However, the exact amounts of money
pledged by the two major players, as well as smaller donations pledged by
other countries, have not been made public.
   A KEDO spokesman declined to comment on the organization's finances or
to provide information on the contributions provided by member nations or
contributing countries. A South Korean embassy official said December 19
that a decision on the amount South Korea will contribute to KEDO has not
been made yet, because the exact cost of the project is not yet known. The
official suggested that a decision might be made following the KEDO board
meeting planned for mid-January.
   Among the key issues to be worked out before construction can begin are
the details of how North Korea will repay South Korea for the financing.
The supply contract states that KEDO will finance the cost of the
construction and will be repaid by the DPRK, interest free, over 20 years,
inclusive of a three-year grace period, beginning with the completion of
each LWR.
   ``Repayment may be in cash, cash equivalents or through transfer of
goods,'' a KEDO release on the agreement stated.
   Under the supply contract, KEDO is to provide a radioactive waste
storage building for low- and medium-level waste with a 10-year storage
capacity for the two LWRs; nuclear fuel for the initial loading of each
plant, including such fuel rods as may be necessary to preserve safety for
initial operation; and technical support services for the first LWR for one
year after its completion.
   The DPRK further agrees: to allow the IAEA to resume ad hoc and routine
inspections of facilities not covered by the nuclear freeze when the supply
agreement was signed; to remain a party to the Treaty on the
Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and to allow implementation of
its safeguards agreement under the NPT; and to come into full compliance
with its IAEA safeguards agreement when a ``significant portion'' of the
LWR project is completed, but before the delivery of key nuclear
components.
   The DPRK also agrees: to conclude a bilateral agreement for peaceful
nuclear cooperation with the U.S. prior to the delivery of key nuclear
components, if U.S. firms provide such components; to transfer spent fuel
from the 5-MW reactor from North Korea when the delivery of key nuclear
components for the first LWR begins; and to begin dismantling its
graphite-moderated reactors and related facilities upon completion of the
first LWR, and to complete the dismantlement upon completion of the second
LWR.
   The contract further states that prior to shipment of any fuel
assemblies, the DPRK will observe the provisions of Convention on Nuclear
Safety, the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident, the
Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological
Emergency, and the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear
Material.

CAMECO'S PORT HOPE REFINERY LICENSE RENEWED JUST DAYS BEFORE EXPIRATION

By:
Ray Silver, Toronto

   Cameco Corp.'s refinery at Port Hope, Ontario was granted a two-year
license renewal December 19, a dozen days before its operating permit would
have expired. The facility is the oldest of four large uranium processing
plants in the world.
   The license renewal had been deferred earlier in the month after area
residents voiced safety and environmental concerns at an Atomic Energy
Control Board meeting. Despite staff reports that the facility posed no
threat to the environment or to public health and safety, several residents
had concerns ranging from emergency response plans to the ultimate
decommissioning of the facility.
   The introduction of environmental issues into the license review
apparently stemmed from a 15-year debate on the disposal of low-level
refinery waste at Port Hope. The Port Hope license renewal was announced a
week after Canada's natural resources minister Anne McLellan said she would
ask the government early this year to consider a task force recommendation
that radioactive Port Hope refinery waste be buried at Atomic Energy of
Canada Ltd.'s Chalk River nuclear station.
   Cameco's predecessor company, Eldorado Nuclear, built the Port Hope
facility in 1932 to extract radium from pitchblende. The plant was modified
12 years later to refine the stockpiled residue and yellowcake to uranium
for the Manhattan Project in the U.S.
   In 1962 Eldorado began to produce uranium oxide (UO2) to fuel Candu
reactors and in 1969 to produce uranium hexafluoride (UF6) for light water
reactors. Both uranium trioxide (U03) from Cameco's Blind River, Ontario
facility and uranium from other producers feed the Port Hope refinery,
which produces 8,000-9,500 metric tons of fuel a year, most of it as UF6
for LWRs in the U.S. and abroad.

EXPERTS SUPPORT CAUTIOUS APPROACH TO INTERNATIONAL SAFETY CONVENTION

By:
Ann MacLachlan, Vienna

   Nuclear safety officials from over 40 countries agreed in Vienna last
week to proceed ''step by step'' towards an international safety regime
that could eventually include a framework convention defining a common
nuclear safety approach and how to achieve it practically.
   German Environment/Nuclear Safety Minister Klaus Toepfer, who chaired
the Vienna meeting under the auspices of the IAEA, said the world is
waiting for all countries using nuclear energy to commit to a safety
regime, which he called ''the cornerstone of nuclear energy.''
   As expected, the conference did not endorse the idea of a binding
convention whereby nations would commit to meet certain minimum safety
standards and submit their installations to international audits--a
surprise proposal Toepfer floated at the conference's opening session (NW,
5 Sept., 1). But IAEA directors and conference participants hailed the
10-point agreement they reached on ways to bolster the international safety
''regime'' as the first tangible consensus of technical and political
nuclear safety experts on the sensitive subject.
   Participants in the meeting, called ''International Conference on
Nuclear Safety: Strategy for the Future,'' saw the unified approach as
indispensable to ensure there are no dangerous outliers among the world's
nuclear power plants and/or operators, which could suffer accidents that
would put the rest of the world's nuclear programs in jeopardy.
   Among the points the 350 experts agreed on were strengthening of
existing IAEA safety service programs, developing ''a common basis'' on
which to judge the safety of reactors built to earlier standards, more
exchange and dissemination of operating experience, and developing common
safety criteria for future reactor designs.
   They also agreed that safety is above all the responsibility of national
authorities, and that the IAEA should help promote ''sufficient national
regulatory oversight.'' They called on national operating organizations and
authorities to come forward to ''identify operating nuclear power plants
which do not meet the high safety performance levels of the vast majority
of operating plants and undertake improvements with assistance from the
international community.''
   Toepfer was visibly pleased at the result and, at a closing press
conference September 6, insisted that the momentum towards a convention of
a binding nature must not be lost. He firmly believes the world nuclear
community must have made clear progress towards such a text by next June,
when the United Nations Conference on Environment & Development meets in
Brazil to discuss, among other things, climate change and a possible
international convention on global warming. ''If you have no good answer
about the control of safety and about handling of nuclear wastes'' to bring
to a concerned world, he said, ''you won't be able to have'' nuclear
energy.
   IAEA Director General Hans Blix said that the earliest a convention
could actually be presented to the agency's Board of Governors and General
Conference would be in one year's time, but the task could well take two
years. Once the convention entered into force, separate protocols then
could be concluded to agree on such things as incident reporting, use of
severity scales, and safety reviews. ''The fewer things you try to do, the
easier it is,'' he commented.
   Although the Soviet-design plants of central and eastern Europe came up
repeatedly in the three days of debate, senior IAEA officials said that the
recommendations were aimed at all countries. Several participants named
India, Mexico, Argentina, and Cuba as countries considered worthy of closer
scrutiny and/or intensified help in the nuclear safety domain, because of
either their inexperience or the closed nature of their nuclear programs.
   The experts also agreed that socio-economic factors should not be used
to justify continued operation of a plant that does not meet agreed-on
minimum safety standards and that if sucha plant cannot be suitably backfit
with available resources, it should be shut down and alternative
electricity sources ''sought.''

But Who Decides?

   The group did not say who should decide all this to whose standards, or
who should provide the electricity, but German technical nuclear safety
chief Adolf Birkhofer said, ''We must judge (a plant's acceptability) on an
ad hoc basis using the best information available including (that of) the
IAEA.'' Toepfer said this might be a ''second-best solution'' awaiting the
agreement on universal standards, but said, ''That's what we have to live
with in political life.''
   Blix told journalists the initial shock the convention proposal
generated in some quarters may have stemmed from misinterpretation of the
word. ''Is a 'convention' an instrument to drive through joint
international standards, or an expression of states'' of their common
commitment? he asked. ''We can come a long way'' towards strengthening
nuclear safety worldwide with existing services and standards promulgated
by the IAEA, such as OSART (Operational Safety Review Team) missions and
NUSS (the agency's Nuclear Safety Standards series), Blix said, but ''a
convention gives it a more solid ground.'' He said a formal convention on
safety, like the conventions on early notification and mutual assistance in
case of nuclear accidents negotiated quickly after the Chernobyl accident
in 1986, would represent ''a higher level of development in the field of
nuclear safety.''
   It would also likely represent a higher level of expenditure for those
countries whose budgets are already being strained for other contributions.
Blix said one OSART typically costs $100,000 and that a program such as
outlined by the experts' meeting would surely cost ''millions of dollars.''
The agency's current program to review the safety of older VVER plants in
eastern Europe has been funded all off-budget, and Assistant Deputy
Director General for Nuclear Safety Morris Rosen said that one-third of the
60 professionals in his division--which absorbs only 6% of the regular IAEA
budget--are working on extrabudgetary programs.
   A major push to increase on-budget nuclear safety-related spending at
the IAEA would almost certainly provoke debate among members. The U.S.,
which contributes 25% of the agency's budget, is concerned about the
proliferation of expensive extrabudgetary programs at the IAEA, but at the
same time is apparently not ready to endorse budget growth for the agency,
which has been living with zero-growth budgets for the past six years.
   Blix said that ''if you run a great many'' of these programs, ''you
can't just run it on a shoestring.'' The agency's Chernobyl project and its
VVER-440 program ''started with nothing and we practically walked around
with a hat,'' he said. ''That's not the way to run a railroad.''
   The issue was to be debated late this week at the IAEA Board of
Governors' meeting before being taken up by the full General Conference,
which meets September 16-20.
   Some participants in the safety conference also questioned whether an
international safety program would be the most efficient way to get at the
real problem plants in the world. ''I'm worried that an international
organization largely funded by us is going to spend a lot of time looking
at us and not where they should be looking,'' commented NRC Commissioner
Forrest Remick, who led the U.S. delegation.
   ''If we're aiming at improving operating plants, setting standards won't
improve that in the short term. What those countries need is help in
implementing the standards we already have,'' Remick told Nucleonics Week.
And ''knowing that some international organization has standards isn't
going to enhance public acceptance of nuclear in the U.S.'' or elsewhere,
he added.

NOVOVORONEZH CALLED 'NO KOZLODUY' BUT SAFETY CULTURE FOUND LACKING

By:
Ann MacLachlan, Paris

   The first IAEA Safety Review Mission to a first-generation PWR
(VVER-440) plant in the USSR, at Novovoronezh, confirmed that conditions
there are nowhere near as alarming as those at the similar Kozloduy plant
in Bulgaria. But officials returning from the Novovoronezh safety mission
in early September said the Russian units still suffer from a number of
design deficiencies, notably lack of separation between systems and
inadequate fire protection. More fundamentally, the Novovoronezh operators
and management, while exhibiting competence and enthusiasm, showed a
disturbing lack of safety culture and safety philosophy as it is understood
in the West, the officials said.
   The conditions discovered by the IAEA team during their safety review of
the four Kozloduy VVER-440 Model 230 reactors in May-June were so
disastrous that they set off alarms all over western Europe and launched a
crash program to aid the Bulgarians to get their plant in order by the
winter. The program, under the auspices of the European Communities and the
World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO), is already under way (NW, 29
Aug., 11). However, Germany is pressing for recognition by the Bulgarians
that the oldest Kozloduy units, 1 and 2, should still be shut as soon as
possible.
   An earlier review of VVER-440/230 units at Bohunice in Czechoslovakia
confirmed that the Czechs had made many safety improvements and had a
satisfactory safety culture. But the question remained open for the
first-generation Soviet VVER-440s at Novovoronezh and Kola (two units at
each site).
   The safety reviews are the final piece of a year-long IAEA-sponsored
''Study of the Safety of Older Reactors,'' focussed on the first-generation
VVER-440s, that is due to wind up in October. A safety review team left
Vienna September 7 for the Kola plant, in the far north of the USSR near
Murmansk.
   ''It's not Kozloduy,'' said a senior IAEA safety review official last
week in regard to the Novovoronezh station. ''The management is committed
to improvement and has sufficient resources and authority'' to do the job,
whereas Kozloduy had been plagued with attrition of senior staff to better
jobs and wholesale abandonment earlier this year by the Soviet experts who
had in effect been running the plant. Nevertheless, the IAEA source said,
the Novovoronezh team found housekeeping problems similar to those at
Kozloduy--indicating that the lessons of Kozloduy had not been taken into
account at the Russian VVER station--and confirmed the well-known design
deficiencies of the VVER-440/230 plants.
   The review covered Novovoronezh-3 and -4, the head-of-series twin
reactors on which Bohunice, Kozloduy, and the now-closed Greifswald
reactors in the former German Democratic Republic were based. Two earlier
prototype units at Novovoronezh, VVER-440 Model 179s, were decommissioned
in 1988 and 1990.
   On the positive side, the IAEA review team confirmed the existence of
conservatism in the early VVER designs due to large primary system water
inventories and a wide core design safety margin. They also found that
pressure vessel annealing as carried out in the USSR today appeared to be
''well established technology,'' according to a press release issued at the
close of the review, and approved backfits already carried out
   Nevertheless, the team said that the leak-before-break concept for
guaranteeing primary circuit integrity must be proven applicable at
VVER-440s in order to establish ''an acceptable safety level for the
long-term backfitting program'' at Novovoronezh. The Soviets have used
leak-before-break to justify the absence of full-pressure containments over
their early PWRs.
   The IAEA team also remained concerned over the potential for
common-cause failures that could affect safety functions, especially as
regards service water systems, boron injection pumps, electrical and
instrumentation & control cable rooms, and control room I&C. The team, a
source said, found a host of safety-related equipment, including safety
injection pumps, in the auxiliary building that also contained turbines and
condensers, with inadequate separation between them. The control room was
separated from the condensers in the turbine hall by a glass door, and fire
doors were blocked open all over the plant.
   ''They seem to have no idea about environmental qualification,
especially for electrical equipment,'' said an IAEA official. The team was
also chagrined at the lack of written procedures for both normal and
emergency operations, and recommended that such procedures be developed so
as to ''remove the reliance and burden placed on operators in needing to
recall operating instructions from memory.''
   The team also was concerned by the ''lack of understanding of safety
philosophy'' at the plant level, as one member put it. Plant management and
operators had no idea about severe accident analyses, saying that was the
business of the design institutes in Moscow, and were not particularly
worried because they had been assured that severe accidents were impossible
at their plant. The plant simulator--the first in the USSR and now
significantly obsolete, according to the IAEA official--cannot reproduce a
steam generator tube rupture beyond the very beginning of the accident
sequence.
   As a start, the IAEA team advised the Novovoronezh management to compile
a safety report for the plant. One never has existed, and safety-related
information is spread over several different institutes, including the VVER
scientific leader Kurchatov Atomic Energy Institute and architect/engineer
Atomenergoprojekt. The plant management produced 600 pages of
safety-related information for the IAEA review team the day the auditors
arrived, apparently the first time all the documentation had been collected
in a single report. ''We told them to pressure the design institutes for
safety studies. It's their plant, they have the right to the information,''
a senior IAEA official said. VVER experts from Kurchatov have been invited
to show up at the current Kola review with their safety documentation, the
official added.
   Members of the Novovoronezh mission are not likely to forget their stay
at the Russian PWR--not for reasons of nuclear safety, but because the
second week of the reviewencompassed the Soviet Union's most dramatic
events in over 70 years. Far from being apathetic about another change in
government as hard-liners were attempting to carry through a coup d'etat in
Moscow, the Novovoronezh citizens sprang to the defense of the USSR's
legitimate government. On August 19, a town meeting was broadcast live on
local television in which the usurpers were repeatedly denounced.
   Euphoria followed the failure of the coup two days later. ''I'll bet it
was the only time a safety review team will see reactor operators crying at
their stations--first from shame because of the coup, then for joy because
democracy had triumphed,'' an IAEA official remarked.

PUBLIC HEARING PROCESS BEGINS AS FINNS PREPARE FOR REACTOR ORDER

By:
Risto Valkeapaa, Loviisa

   Finnish power companies Imatran Voima Oy and Teollisuuden Voima Oy (IVO
and TVO) have begun the information campaign that, under Finnish nuclear
law, is the first step in preparations for the country's planned fifth
nuclear reactor.
   IVO and TVO sent 45,000 letters September 9 to households in the areas
of Loviisa and Eurajoki, their two current nuclear power plant sites. The
letters contain a general study of the planned new power unit as well as
notification from the Ministry of Trade & Industry of public hearings on
the issue October 15 in Eurajoki and October 22 in Loviisa.
   Preliminary public information meetings are also planned October 2 in
the two towns.
   IVO Managing Director Kalevi Numminen opened the event at an information
meeting in Loviisa and TVO Chairman Juhani Ahava, in Eurajoki, but the
interest center-of-gravity was Loviisa. IVO's predominant role in the
information process was underscored by the fact that even the information
material was produced mostly by IVO.
   Numminen confirmed that four plant types are in the Finnish competition:
ABB Atom's BWR-90; NPI-BWR, a Siemens-design BWR proposed by Nuclear Power
International (NPI); NPI-PWR, a Siemens-Framatome PWR also proposed by NPI;
and a modern VVER-1000 from Atomenergoexport of the USSR. It is commonly
known that IVO is keenly interested in being architect/engineer of the
planned reactor and that the company has very good knowledge of PWRs from
having operated the two Loviisa units.
   Numminen said the Finnish project must proceed speedily because new
generating capacity will certainly be needed after 1995. He said history
had shown that electricity needs grow after periods of recession and that
Finland's economy has been raised by improving industrial efficiency and
technical methods, all of which implies more electricity demand.

CASH-STRAPPED MCDERMOTT MAY SELL FRAMATOME MORE OF B&W VENTURES

By:
Ben A. Franklin, Washington; Ann MacLachlan, Paris

   McDermott International, Inc., the Louisiana-based oil service company
which now owns 50% stakes in the profitable Babcock & Wilcox subsidiaries,
B&W Nuclear Services Co. (BWNS) and B&W Fuel Co. (BWFC), is expected to
sell controlling interests in the two joint ventures to Framatome to raise
cash. McDermott and Framatome held out the possibility that the French
company would increase its holding in the two subsidiaries at a later
date.
   In 1989 McDermott sold half ownership in BWNS to Framatome and 49% of
BWFC to Virginia Fuel Inc., a consortium of Framatome, Cogema, and Uranium
Pechiney in which Framatome holds 40%.
   The deal now under discussion was said to be worth $70-million. It would
raise the French owners' stake in each B&W enterprise to 75% for now, with
a likely third helping later. BWNS and BWFC, which account for 85% of B&W's
civilian nuclear business, have been profitable and growing (NW, 13 June,
11).
   A Framatome official said that the French vendor is so pleased with the
performance of and prospects for the B&W ventures that ''if we had had to
take over all of McDermott's share, we would have done it.''
   B&W and Framatome said the parties expect to complete the transfer of
ownership by the end of this year and added the companies are ''discussing
arrangements whereby Framatome would have the opportunity to further
increase its ownership of both companies at a future date.''
   Framatome board chairman Jean-Claude Leny said his firm's increased
commitment to the B&W companies underscored its confidence in the future of
nuclear energy, especially in America. Leny said he believes a nuclear
revival ''inevitable'' in the U.S. and that it could start as soon as three
years from now. Framatome also is counting on expansion of the nuclear
services market with massive replacement of steam generators and
rejuvenation related to plant life extension.
   By joint agreement, BWNS and BWFC are to remain under the management of
current President Charles Pryor.
   ''The motive here is pretty clearly McDermott's need to improve its
balance sheet by adding cash,'' a Wall Street analyst said. ''They are
losing money in the oil service business. They sold the crown jewels of
B&W, Bailey Controls, to an Italian company, Finmeccanica, for $295-million
in 1989. But that and the earlier B&W spinoffs to the French apparently
just weren't enough.''
   Don Washington, a McDermott spokesman, said his company's guidance to
B&W in shedding its civilian nuclear business, which is based largely in
Lynchburg, Va., reflected McDermott's announced ''consideration of sales to
increase liquidity.''

FIFTH TEAM OF WNP-2 OPERATORS AGAIN FAILS REQUALIFICATION TEST

   A WNP-2 crew has failed one of three simulator tests, postponing reactor
restart for ''at least several more weeks,'' according to utility spokesman
John Britton. The outage, which began for refueling in April, is costing
the Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) about $100,000 per day.
   When only three of the five required control room operator crews passed
NRC requalification exams last February and March, WPPSS had to postpone to
late August WNP-2's post-refueling restart of WNP-2. Instead, WPPSS resumed
retraining the two failed crews and prepared for re-exams (NW, 18 July,
6).
   On September 9, one of the two flunked crews again failed one of three
simulator emergency scenarios.
   Britton said one of the two crews given makeup requalification tests
this week was successful. But the second--the fifth crew of the five
required--did not do well enough in a late afternoon and evening simulator
challenge. ''They failed only one of three different emergency scenarios,''
Britton said, ''but making no apologies, the overall fact is that they
failed.'' He said WPPSS would begin immediately ''putting together a new
crew.''

BARSEBAECK BWR PUMP FAILURE
REHEATS COOLANT DURING REFUELING

By:
Mark Hibbs, Bonn

    A pump trip at Sydkraft AB' Barsebaeck-2 on September 6 led to
reheating of reactor coolant in the pressure vessel for several hours
during a refueling outage. The incident has been classified as level 1 on
the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES).
    Plant officials this week said that for about 3.5 hours on Friday,
September 6, failure of the one oprating residual heat removal (RHR) pump
operating caused the water temperature in the pressure vessel to increase
from 50 degrees C to about 98 degrees C. With the pump in operation after
the BWR had been shut down to begin the outage, water temperature had
fallen as planned to 50 degrees C.
    The two RHR pumps are periodically used during reactor operation to
circulate coolant through heat exchangers and ion filters. During refueling
outages they are used to lower coolant temperature prior to opening the
vessel.
    The pump failed to work after a suction valve began to close and
tripped the pump. The valve is pneumatic and nitrogen pressure dropped when
a pressure relief valve was tested. With the main circulation pumps shut
down at the onset of the refueling operation, water temperature in the
vessel began to increase when the heat removal pump failed. The second RHR1
pump was available and was started manually after the first pump was found
out of service, officials said, and coolant temperature was again lowered
to 50 degrees C.
    Operators in the control room during the beginning of the refueling
exercise did not notice that water temperature in the vessel had increased,
since temperature monitors were not located in a position on the residual
heat removal lines so as to record the temperature. The increase was
noticed only when the lid to the pressure vessel was removed and a ''small
release'' of steam occurred, the official said, but the release was below
the level which, would have triggered radiation alarms. After a short
delay, however, a fire protection alarm was triggered by the release, he
said.
   The refueling outage at the reactor was scheduled to take 13 days.
Because of the incident, however, the lengthj of the outage might be
increased, the official said.

SETTLEMENT ON GRAND GULF COULD RECOUP $90-MILLION FOR NOPSI

   An agreement in principle would permit New Orleans Public Service Inc.
(NOPSI) to recoup an additional $90-million of its Grand Gulf-1 nuclear
plant investment from ratepayers. NOPSI has already written off
$186.2-million of its $535.5-million share of Grand Gulf.
   The tentative agreement announced last week between NOPSI, the New
Orleans City Council, and the Alliance for Affordable Energy would end
three years of litigation over the city council's ''prudence'' disallowance
of $135-million of Grand Gulf-1 costs.
   The 1,306-MW General Electric BWR came on-line in 1985, and in 1988 the
city council disallowed recovery of $135-million after finding
$476.2-million imprudent. The utility had already written off $51.2-million
of the plant's costs, which were 15.3% of Grand Gulf's $3.5-billion.
   Appeals and counterappeals in the case were heard in both Louisiana and
federal courts, and the case is scheduled to be heard by the U.S. Supreme
Court later this year.
   The agreement calls for NOPSI to reduce electric rates by $11.3-million
when the agreement becomes effective; but then allows rate increases of
$7.3-million in 1992, $6.7-million in 1993, $5.2-million in 1994, and
$4.4-million in 1995.
   In exchange for these increases, aimed at re-capturing Grand Gulf costs,
NOPSI will freeze any other rate increases for five years and concede to a
13.76% cap on earnings from electric operations.
   The New Orleans City Council has scheduled a public hearing on the
proposed settlement for September 19, with a decision expected around
October 3.

IRRADIATION ACCIDENT SHOCKS FRANCE; 'CRACKDOWN' ON SMALL USERS PROMISED

By:
Ann MacLachlan, Paris

   Two men remained hospitalized in France this week after being severely
irradiated in August by electrons from a particle beam accelerator at an
industrial enterprise in Forbach, near Metz. France's environment minister
said the accident shows that insufficient attention has been paid to small
users of radioactivity and promised a ''crackdown'' on such uses.
   The estimated doses sustained by the workers, who came from the
temporary-employment agency Manpower and had apparently not received
training in radioprotection, were reported to be between 50 and 100 rem,
but an expert at the Institut de Protection et de Surete Nucleaire (IPSN)
said the exposures must have been much higher to have caused the
radiation-induced burns from which the patients are suffering. IPSN was
conducting biological exams of the patients early this week at the Percy
military hospital in Clamart, near Paris, to determine the doses with
greater accuracy. The accident is the most serious of its kind on Labor
Department record in France.
   A third person, a recently hired crew leader, was also irradiated but
much less severely and was not hospitalized with the others August 27. The
enterprise, Electron Beam Service (EBS), which used the beams to refine
carbon particles, has been ordered closed and responsibilities in the
affair are under investigation by the regional Labor Department and the
prosecutor general of Sarreguemines. The company, pleading human error on
the workers' part, says safety instructions forbade entering the beam hall
for 10 to 15 minutes after the beam was switched off, but local Labor
officials say the instructions were written in English and that EBS had not
declared the existence of the accelerator to the authorities.
   Environment/Risks Minister Brice Lalonde declared, ''I didn't know you
could have a particle accelerator in your attic. We have been paying so
much attention to the tree of nuclear power plants, we haven't seen the
forest of small users'' of radiation equipment. ''We are going to have to
really crack down.''
   The dose estimates of 50 to 100 rem reported in the French media over
last weekend were far too low, according to the IPSN expert, to have led to
the effects suffered by the two workers: skin burns several millimeters
deep and loss of hair. The results of the IPSN examination are covered by
medical confidentiality. But a radioprotection expert told Nucleonics Week
that skin burns, radiodermatitis, and other radioactivity-induced effects
imply irradiation to at least ''several tens of Gray'' with a minimum of 6
Gray. One Gray equals 100 rad. Grays and rads measure the energy absorbed
by irradiated matter; 100 rem is equivalent to 100 rad, but rem measures
the biological damage done to living tissue that has been irradiated.
Experts say that above 50 rem--at which level no biological damage is
observed--one should speak rather of rad, or Gray.
   By way of comparison, ''liquidators'' working on the Chernobyl nuclear
plant site in 1986 almost routinely received doses of 50 rem, but those who
contracted radiation sickness on the night of the catastrophe were said to
have received upwards of 600 rem (6 Gray).

CHEMICAL WASTE MANAGEMENT PLANS MIXED WASTE FACILITY AT HANFORD

By:
Richard R. Zuercher, Washington

   Chemical Waste Management, Inc. (CWM) plans to spend more than
$100-million to build and operate a facility to clean up waste that is both
hazardous and radioactive at DOE's Hanford nuclear reservation in
Washington.
   The company--a unit of Waste Management, Inc.--says the state-of-the-art
Tri-Cities Environmental Analysis & Treatment (Treat) complex will function
as an analytical laboratory and waste treatment facility for wastes
produced by DOE and other generators in the Pacific Northwest.
   ''We expect to invest over $100-million in CWM facilities at Hanford
over the next six to eight years to bring our world-renowned commercial
clean-up experience to serve DOE's needs as well as those of the Pacific
Northwest,'' said CWM Chairman Jerry Dempsey. ''Having these facilities
available will accelerate the cleanup of Hanford by years and reduce
overall restoration costs.''
   Dempsey said CWM expects to first build an analytical facility adjacent
to the Hanford reservation. Construction tentatively is set to start later
this year, with the facility to come on line in 1993. The facility will
provide laboratory analysis of mixed waste (low level radwaste also
designated as chemically hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency),
and will accommodate Treat management staff and CWM scientists who plan to
participate jointly in research with DOE's Pacific Northwest Laboratory.
   CWM currently is negotiating for purchase of the land, in the city of
Richland at the Port of Benton's Richland Airport, CWM said.
   The second major component of the Treat complex will be a waste
treatment facility on the Hanford reservation. That facility, to be
licensed by Washington state and built over the next two to six years, will
contain separation, sampling, records management, incineration,
stabilization, repackaging, and transportation operations needed to treat
mixed waste from Hanford and regional commercial generators. Construction
is expected to begin in 1993, CWM said.
   The waste treatment complex will be built in the center of the
560-square-mile reservation, about eight miles from the Columbia River and
agricultural areas of the Columbia Basin. CWM said the facility's advanced
effluent controls and the extensive buffer provided by the Hanford site
will do much to make the facility environmentally sound.
   ''The facility will be designed so that, as the Hanford mixed-waste
market grows and advanced technologies become fully available, enhancements
to the treatment complex can be made to safely maintain efficient
operations and high environmental standards,'' the company said. Residues
from the processing of waste will not be dumped at the Treat facility but
will be disposed of at off-site commercial hazardous, licensed low-level
radwaste facilities, or--in the case of Hanford mixed waste--be returned to
Hanford.
   While waste available for treatment in DOE's current inventory is small
compared to other Pacific Northwest markets--about 75 tons of hazardous
waste and 50 tons of mixed waste annually--this type of waste is expected
to increase significantly over the next few years, CWM said. CWM projects
that two-thirds of the waste it eventually will treat will come from DOE,
with the remainder from the commercial market. No tonnage projections were
available. Constructing the waste facility now will serve to avoid the need
for prolonged storage and the environmental risks that accompany it, the
company said.
   Dempsey said serving both DOE and Pacific Northwest markets is key to
the Treat complex's financial viability. The complex is expected to employ
some 200 workers, he added.

COURT ORDER ENDS SECRECY IN DOE PROCEDURES THWARTING FOIA

By:
Ben A. Franklin, Washington

   A federal judge in Los Angeles ruled this week that DOE--acting in
secrecy--wrote departmental procedures designed to shield from disclosure
under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) the safety, health and other
records of the corporate contractors running its nuclear weapons program.
The court ordered an end to the concealment.
   The September 9 ruling by U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie denied
DOE's petition for summary dismissal of the suit. Instead, the court
granted all demands by the plaintiff in the case, the Committee to Bridge
the Gap (CBG), for the public release of DOE proposals for, and drafts of,
previously hidden rules and orders designed both to thwart FOIA requests
and to block public scrutiny of the department's process of concealment.
   The decision directs DOE henceforth to submit all directives and orders
affecting the public release of contractor data to formal rulemaking
procedure, and requires public notice and opportunity for public comment.
(Civil Action 90-3568-ER).
   Daniel Hirsch, president of CBG, the Los Angeles-based public interest
group that began the dispute in 1988 when DOE denied its FOIA
request--called the decision ''a tremendous victory for public oversight of
DOE.''
   ''Proposals to prevent public access to records of DOE's
contractor-operated facilities have been roundly defeated,'' Hirsch said in
a statement. ''This marks the end of DOE's practice of secretly making
rules affecting the public.'' The plaintiffs charged that DOE officials had
been proposing to shield from disclosure, among other things, data on
worker exposure to radioactivity.
   DOE seemed somewhat less excited by the court ruling. ''Our lawyers call
it a non-event,'' a departmental spokesman said. ''We were going to do this
anyway, and told the court so. But I guess the plaintiffs would say we did
not agree to that until they filed suit.''
   CBG said the irony was that DOE has been promulgating rules that tighten
its FOIA procedures, and doing so in secret. ''They were doing it by
calling the changes 'orders' instead of regulations so they could evade the
requirement that proposed regulations be published for public comment.''
Hirsch said.
   The lawsuit, given a preliminary hearing April 29 (NW, 2 May, 4), was
based in part on CBG's unofficial access through a ''leak'' of a
memorandum from Bruce Twining, manager of DOE's Albuquerque, N.M.,
operations office. CBG cited what it said was Twining's proposal that
contractors' documents on DOE weapons program activities be made virtually
invulnerable to requests under the FOIA, and even more tightly
''suppressed'' than suggested by top department officials in Washington.
   The litigation began when CBG submitted an FOIA request for copies of
changes proposed by DOE in its FOIA procedures and had both that request
and an administrative appeal of its denial turned down by DOE. ''We had to
file an FOIA request, an appeal of its denial, and finally had to go to
court to obtain a copy of DOE's proposed FOIA rule changes,'' Hirsch said.

SELIN BACKS LICENSING REFORM BILL DESPITE AMBIGUITY OVER NRC ROLE

By:
David Stellfox and Dave Airozo, Washington

   NRC can live with the Bush Administration's ideas on nuclear plant
licensing reform legislation even though the pending legislation that
brings about the change (S. 1220) is ''sort of ambiguous'' about NRC's
authority to make a final, overall, pre-operational safety finding.
   Though he concedes the ambiguity, NRC Chairman Ivan Selin isn't bothered
by it. What does have him uneasy is the possibility that the House of
Representatives will offer companion legislation that will gut one of the
keystones of the Administration-backed bill or that the Administration, in
its zeal to pass licensing reform, could ''inadvertently trash'' the
agency's new one step-licensing rule--a rule the commission believes is
adequate and not in need of legislative undergirding.
   Selin's comments to Nucleonics Week came by way of explanation of
previous and apparently contradictory statements on S. 1220.
   When Selin told a House subcommittee in July that the commission would
not object to certain changes in the bill, he appeared to contradict, or at
least back away from, previous commission support for the legislation.
   Secretary of Energy James Watkins, keenly aware of Wall Street's
leeriness about nuclear investments, thinks S. 1220 is fine the way it is
and could help spark a nuclear revival here. Selin's comments prompted
Watkins to dash off a letter--which quickly became public--taking issue
with Selin's statements, particularly his apparent endorsement of a
proposed change that might make it easier for intervenors to get a
post-construction hearing on a new plant.
   Post-construction hearings are anathema to nuclear power's boosters,
because of the uncertainty they create. Such hearings could drag on for
months or years, they argue, and the finished plant could sit idle,
generating nothing but additional interest payments, as has happened in the
past.
   Selin told Nucleonics Week last week that the difference in positions is
only apparent and that he was speaking in the abstract when he testified to
the House subcommittee, chaired by Rep. Peter Kostmayer (D-Pa.)
    ''Kostmayer asked a number of questions about (whether) we would
support certain kinds of legislation,'' Selin said. ''I'm sure he asked
them in the context of his interpretation of S. 1220, but they're not
necessarily our interpretation of S. 1220. So I just took them on the face
of it.
   ''It did not seem appropriate...(to) argue with him as to whether his
questions described a particular piece of legislation,'' Selin continued.
''I answered them as, if faced with such legislation, what would our
reaction be. When Secretary Watkins wrote to me, he was talking about a
specific piece of legislation, which is somewhat different from the piece
of legislation described by Chairman Kostmayer in his questions to me and
therefore elicits somewhat different answers.''
   In fact, the answers were sufficiently different as to appear
contradictory--supporting on the one hand S. 1220, which increases the
burden on intervenors seeking hearings, and Kostmayer's suggested changes
to S. 1220, which would lower those same thresholds.
   Congressional sources found Selin's explanation lacking. ''Chairman
Kostmayer's understanding is, and the transcript shows, that that is what
he was trying to get to,'' one source close to the matter said. ''He has
deep concerns about the hurdles intervenors would have to jump under the
legislation.''
   Selin said some of Kostmayer's questioning was aimed at trying ''to put
a little daylight between the commission and the Administration in saying
'you don't really support this bill that's up there, do you?'''
   Selin reiterated NRC's support for S. 1220 last week, but told
Nucleonics Week supporting the Administration's view is not NRC's job.
''The commission's view, from a regulatory point of view, (10 Code of
Federal Regulations) Part 52 is quite adequate, and we still believe that.
On the other hand, we don't have a judgment as to what it is going to take
to have the industry invest or for people to raise money. That's DOE's job.
If it is their judgment that legislation would make it more likely to
foster an attractive competitive climate, we neither agree nor disagree,
that's not our job. So when we make our statement that (Part) 52 is
adequate, we're not making a business judgment, we're making a regulatory
judgment.''
   With that qualification, Selin said the commission could support S. 1220
as it now stands, adding however that the commission is concerned about
what will happen with legislation in the House. He said it's clear
Kostmayer wants the bill amended so that the opportunity for a second,
pre-operational hearing would be mandatory--a requirement that would
''displease'' the commission.
   Some NRC sources believe S. 1220 would unduly tie the commission's hands
by limiting its authority to make an overall, pre-operational determination
about a plant's safety. In his letter to Selin, Watkins said S. 1220 does
not diminish the discretion that the commission ''currently has under
existing authority'' to make safety determinations on its own initiative.
   Though S. 1220 does not eliminate the long-standing authority for a
pre-operational hearing in Section 189(a) of the Atomic Energy Act (AEA),
the bill establishes a whole new subsection, 189(b), which creates a higher
threshold for intervenors seeking hearings and restricts such hearings
solely to conformance with the requirements of the combined construction
permit/operating license and its associated inspections, tests, analyses,
and acceptance criteria (ITAAC).
   Selin acknowledged that S. 1220 is ''sort of ambiguous'' on this point,
but the ambiguity doesn't really bother him because courts have always
deferred to NRC's broad authority to protect the public health and safety.
''So, as a practical matter I don't think there's any difference between
the two, but it's helpful to have the executive agency (DOE) agree...that
nothing precludes our ability to find that a plant is or isn't healthful
and safe at the time of operation,'' Selin said.
   Ron Simard, a spokesman for the Nuclear Management & Resources Council,
said the new AEA section covering combined licenses would restrict NRC to
the ITAAC, but added that the agency has sufficient authority under Section
161(b) and 161(p) ''to immediately shut down a plant or impose other
conditions'' at any time. That NRC authority applies only to plants already
licensed and operating. The purpose of the new Section 189(b) created by
the legislation is ''to establish some reasonable constraints on the issues
that will be considered during the post-construction and pre-operational
stage,'' Simard said.
   The removal of language from the new Section 189(b) which would require
a commission ''finding'' that the plant is ready to go on line was to
accommodate a DOE concern, Selin said. ''Their understanding is that, by
putting in the word 'finding,' we require a hearing, or at least if someone
challenges, they have to be given a hearing. Our understanding--my General
Counsel--says that's not true. The hearing situation is not affected by the
phrase.
    ''Our General Counsel thinks the hearing situation is identical
whether you call it a finding, or approval of an ITAAC, or a judgment,''
Selin continued. ''It's still the commission's decision on whether a
hearing is called for or not, subject to judicial review. So, at least in
my opinion...what they were nervous about was that, in putting in the word
'finding,' we would make it more difficult for the commission to decide in
a specific case that a hearing was unnecessary.''
   Selin said the big difference between NRC and the Administration is
''none of these things. Our main discomfort is none of these things we've
discussed. If, in trying to get (S.) 1220 through, the Administration were
to inadvertently trash Part 52, we then might end up with neither (the
nuclear power provisions) of (S.) 1220 nor a practical (Part) 52 and then
we don't have a single-step license.''
   He said, ''The Department...just as they think we've changed our public
policy a little bit, they've changed their nuances a little bit. In their
last statement, I'm very comfortable with the letter Secretary Watkins sent
us.''

KOREA PLANS 13 MORE REACTORS TO MAKE NUCLEAR MAIN GENERATOR

By:
Elaine Hiruo, London

   An additional 13 commercial reactors will be constructed by the year
2006 in South Korea under the government's revised long-term development
program, according to Choi Dae Yong, vice president of procurement with
Korea Electric Power Corp.
   The units will be in addition to a 700-MW Candu plant Atomic Energy of
Canada Ltd. received a contract for in February (NW, 3 Jan., 1) and the two
1,000-MW PWRs that will be constructed under a contract awarded to ABB
Combustion Engineering in July (NW, 25 July, 1). The country plans
increasing domestic content of the new reactors and is aiming for complete
self-sufficiency in nuclear construction and operation (NW, 11 Oct. '90,
5).
   Speaking at the Uranium Institute symposium last week in London, Choi
said two more 700-MW Candu pressurized heavy water reactors (PHWRs) and two
1,000-MW PWRs will be constructed by 2001, and six 1,000-MW PWRs and three
700-MW PHWRs are planned for construction by 2006.
   ''The electrical share of final (all) energy consumption increased from
3.7% in 1970 to 11% in 1991. It will be over 14% in 2001,'' Choi said.
''Korea's (per capita) electricity consumption is still much less than that
of advanced industrialized countries, being one-quarter that of Japan and
one-sixth that of the United States. There is therefore the potential for a
rapid increase in electricity demand in the future.''
   He said that peak electricity demand in the country recorded an annual
average growth of 15% during the last 30 years but that reserve capacity
during the 1991 summer peak was only 4.5%.
   Nuclear accounted for 49.1% of electricity generation in South Korea in
1990; the average capacity factor of its nine units exceeded 70%. Nuclear
is projected to produce 54.6% of electricity in 2006, with coal producing
29.8%.
   The projections are a sharp contrast to 1981 when oil was the dominant
generator, producing 79.8% of the country's electricity. Projections for
2006 show a drastic drop in oil, with that fuel's power production at only
2.6%. In 1981 nuclear was the No. 2 producer in South Korea with a 7.2%
share. Coal--which was at the bottom, trailing behind hydro's
6.7%--accounted for only 6.3% of the total power generation.
   But in order for new units to be constructed in a timely manner, Choi
said, such hurdles as investment financing, securing sites for construction
and transmission equipment, and public opinion must be overcome. He pointed
to a 1991 poll that showed that only 67.6% of the people surveyed supported
construction of nuclear power plants. A 1986 poll put support at 72.4%.
   ''If Korea is to develop nuclear power continuously, and to achieve
self-reliance in energy, the misconceptions among the public on the safety
of nuclear power must be cleared up and their understanding and support
secured,'' he said. The public outreach campaign underway in South Korea
involves the publication of booklets and pamphlets, conducting site tours,
and making nuclear-related information available to the public, he said.

ITALIAN REGULATOR GIVEN AUTONOMY AS ENERGY AGENCY CHANGES FOCUS

By:
Marion Bywater, Rome

   Italian nuclear regulatory agency DISP is to be rendered more
''legitimate'' and financially autonomous under new legislation passed by
Parliament, although it will continue to be a part of state energy research
agency ENEA.
   The new law also officially transforms ENEA from a predominantly
nuclear-oriented entity to one focusing on the environment and alternate
energy sources and carrying out only limited nuclear research in the areas
of plant safety and radiation protection. ENEA's full name--but not its
acronym--will change to ''Ente per le Nuove Tecnologie, l'Energia e
l'Ambiente'' (Agency for New Technologies, Energy & Environment).
   Officials at DISP (Direzione Centrale per la Sicorezza Nucleare e la
Protezione Sanitaria) say the new legislation contains no great practical
innovations but it ''institutionalizes our autonomy. We are very pleased
about the change because it makes things clearer. It truly gives us a
completely independent identity.''
   The changes have been under discussion by Italian legislators since
Italy voted its nuclear moratorium in 1987. Initially it looked as if ENEA
might be abolished and DISP spun off as a stand-alone agency, but
legislators ultimately decided to leave the regulatory agency as a
directorate within ENEA, apparently because they felt establishing a
separate regulatory board could have sent the wrong signals in
nuclear-sensitive Italy.
   The wording of the law, however, ''underscores our legitimacy,'' DISP
officials said. It provides a statutory guarantee that DISP should have
''independence in carrying out its specific functions and full management
and organizational autonomy.''
   Instead of having its budget allocated by ENEA, DISP has been given an
annual allocation of 45-billion lire (U.S.$40-million) within the
1.7-trillion lire ($1.3-billion) budget authorization for ENEA for the
period 1991-1993.
   DISP officials said that they expect to have enough funds within this
budget not only to run the 290-person agency on a day-to-day basis, but to
have ''not much, but a not negligible'' margin left over for regulatory
research.

UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS LOOM ON IRAQI CENTRIFUGE EFFORT

By:
Mark Hibbs, Bonn

   A fifth IAEA inspection team will head for Iraq this month in search of
answers to key unresolved questions about that country's clandestine effort
to build and operate gas centrifuges. In October, a larger IAEA mission
will go to Iraq to follow up.
   At present, there is no consensus at the IAEA about the extent to which
Iraq relied on foreign assistance to build centrifuge components and
assemble them at a facility known as El Pharat, located south of Baghdad.
Official sources said that Iraq still refuses to disclose foreign sources
for centrifuge design information and components. ''They are not
cooperating and they still claim they can make and operate centrifuges all
by themselves,'' one official said (NW, 22 Aug., 7).
   According to the IAEA inspection report on the fourth mission to Iraq,
which was completed last week but has not been made public, before
inspectors arrived at El Pharat, the labels had been scraped off imported
equipment meant to be used for manufacturing centrifuge components, in an
attempt to disguise their origin.
   Iraqi experts previously told the IAEA that Iraq had designed its
clandestine nuclear program by building redundant facilities in order to
prevent interruption should any one secret location be discovered or
destroyed. Thus, Iraq constructed two identical calutron enrichment
facilities at Tarmiyah and Al Sharqat, although inspectors are not sure
whether Al Sharqat, which was less complete when the Gulf War began, was
meant as a backup for Tarmiyah or as a simultaneous operation.
   During the fourth inspection, however, the IAEA was not shown a twin for
the centrifuge production facility at El Pharat.
   The latest IAEA report states that, in the view of inspectors, Iraq,
which claimed it could manufacture 200 centrifuges per year at El Pharat as
of 1993, might have been able to manufacture as many as 600 centrifuges per
year later in the 1990s.
   But that is viewed with skepticism by some western centrifuge experts.
These sources say that the IAEA estimate extrapolates future centrifuge
output in large part from the spatial dimensions of the workshops at El
Pharat. These experts asserted that IAEA inspectors have seen no evidence
yet that Iraq can mass-produce key components such as spiral-grooved bottom
bearings and magnetic suspension top bearings, no evidence that Iraq has
access to sufficient quantities of centrifuge-grade maraging steel, and no
evidence that Iraq has cascade engineering expertise.
   For these reasons, these experts assert, Iraq would need substantial
help from a foreign source to meet its goal of building and operating a
500-centrifuge cascade by 1996. A cascade that large might have been
capable of producing about 5 kilograms of high-enriched uranium (HEU) per
year--about one-fifth the amount needed for an initial nuclear explosive
device (NuclearFuel, 19 Aug., 12).

Two Rotor Assemblies Operated

   The IAEA report on the fourth inspection confirmed that no indigenously
manufactured rotors shown to inspectors were of sufficient quality for
uranium enrichment.
   During the inspection, IAEA officials learned that Iraq had obtained 10
carbon fiber centrifuge rotors, and test-operated two complete carbon fiber
rotor assemblies using uranium hexafluoride feed material. However, these
rotor tubes were supplied to Iraq by an outside source.
   With the exception of some simple rotor tubes made of aluminum, all
rotor tubes manufactured in Iraq were made of maraging steel. To produce
these, IAEA inspectors found, Iraq had obtained 25 plates of 350-grade
maraging steel from a foreign source. Iraq claimed that 19 sheets were made
into preforms at the Al Nassr State Enterprise for Mechanical Industries at
Taji, near Baghdad. Iraq also told inspectors that six more maraging steel
preforms for centrifuge rotors had been obtained from a foreign source.
   According to IAEA documents, only nine sufficiently balanced maraging
steel rotors had been made using the 25 pieces of maraging steel. None were
of sufficient quality for enriching uranium.
   Some Iraqi officials told IAEA inspectors they were confident that Iraq
could have evaded export controls on 350-grade maraging steel and could
have imported sufficient quantities for building many centrifuges. However,
IAEA inspectors found no other quantities of maraging steel in Iraq.
   An interim IAEA report compiled during the fourth inspection stated that
Iraqi officials ''claim to have had severe difficulties in obtaining
maraging steel yet they proceed with a plan that would require a dependable
supply.''
   The interim report stated that Iraqi officials led IAEA officials to
believe that Iraq planned to indigenously produce maraging steel. However,
Iraqi suggestions that domestic production of this specialty steel was
possible were not supported by officials at the Al Badr General
Establishment, located south of Baghdad at Mahmoudiya, which Iraq declared
to be a centrifuge production facility. Engineers at Al Badr ''complained
bitterly about the poor quality'' of carbon steel which Iraq had already
produced.

Cascade Engineering Primitive?

   The three large-scale centrifuge enrichment facilities in Europe which
are owned and operated by the Urenco consortium were built only after
centrifuge designs had been proven in extensive test programs and machines
assembled and operated in small pilot cascades.
   One western centrifuge expert told Nucleonics Week he was ''astonished''
that Iraq had planned to build two large cascades based on a centrifuge
design very similar to Urenco's G-1 centrifuge--a 100-machine cascade by
1993 and a 500-machine cascade by 1996--without having first built and
successfully operated a pilot cascade with only a few machines.
   Advanced countries ''wouldn't have done it that way,'' he said. In
Brazil's clandestine centrifuge program, experts built and operated a
cascade with eight machines in the late 1980s before manufacturing several
hundred centrifuges for a larger cascade.
   Iraq had considered building a cascade with 36 centrifuges after it
tested single rotors, but then abandoned that plan and proceeded instead to
concentrate on a cascade design with 102 centrifuges, western sources said.
Cascade designs shown to inspectors by the Iraqis for both the 36-machine
and the 102-machine configurations were based on a separation factor of
1.15-1.18 and a ''cut'' of 0.5. The separation factor quantifies the degree
of separation which can be obtained in a single centrifuge. The ''cut''
describes the ratio of product flow to feed flow in a centrifuge stage.
   However, one western expert said, Iraq's cascade designs were based on
only ''back of the envelope calculations'' for production of enriched
uranium. Iraqi experts showed inspectors calculations for production of 3%
U-235 only, using simple, ideal cascades, which provided no evidence of
extensive cascade engineering know-how.
   Iraqi officials denied that they had tried to design a cascade for
production of highly-enriched uranium (HEU). But that assertion is viewed
with skepticism by western experts.
   Iraqi officials' confidence in their ability to proceed from single
centrifuges to large cascades might have been illusory, and prompted by
competition between task teams involved in Iraq's clandestine nuclear
effort, sources said.
   Alternately, Iraqi confidence might also indicate that the centrifuge
program was guided by an outside expert,yet unknown to the IAEA or western
intelligence agencies, who had great familiarity with centrifuge design and
manufacture. The chief inspector during the fourth IAEA mission, David Kay,
reported from the field last month that such a guiding hand ''must have
been there.'' In evidence of this, inspectors found that Iraq had modified
its centrifuge design, which closely resembled the Urenco G-1 centrifuge
built in Germany, to include the spiral-grooved bottom bearing from G-2, an
improved Urenco centrifuge.
   During the fourth inspection, the most senior Iraqi official providing
information to the IAEA was Jaffar Dhiah, a vice director of the Iraqi
Atomic Energy Commission. While Kay stated last month that he believed
Jaffar Dhiah was not the guiding light behind Iraq's secret program, the
official inspection report completed by the IAEA last week asserted that
Jaffar had been in charge of the program.
   At the outset of bench testing of a G-1 rotor assembly, the ''cut'' of
the centrifuge might be as low as 0.1, requiring optimization of scoops
which are fitted inside the rotor tube. At a warehouse complex called Ash
Shakyh, inspectors found a press for inserting baffles and scoops into the
rotor cylinder. But sources said that, even if Iraqi experts had managed to
optimize the ''cut'' of the G-1 centrifuge to 0.5 (which at Urenco might
have taken only several weeks of careful and intensive testing), Iraq would
still have had to build 50 or more stages containing several thousand
optimized G-1 centrifuges in a cascade to make significant quantities of
HEU.
   But Iraq had apparently not optimized the single rotors it had
flow-formed itself. Using the first of two test stands found in Iraq by
inspectors, Iraq was able to spin a simple, so-called Beams-type or ''model
I'' centrifuge rotor at a velocity of 50,000 revolutions per minute (rpm).
However, when the ''model I'' rotor assembly was used for test separation
of product using light gases (not heavy uranium hexaflouride), speeds of
only 20,000 to 25,000 rpm were achieved.
   The ''model II'' centrifuge rotors which Iraq tested on a second test
stand, and which officials described as very close to G-1, could spin at an
optimal speed of 60,000 rpm without feed material. However,
mass-spectrometric examinations indicated that these rotors had apparently
not been tested with uranium hexaflouride feed.
   After inspectors arrive in Iraq on the fifth mission, they will pursue
Iraq's claim that it had manufactured magnetic suspension top bearings. A
German firm, Inwako GmbH, exported some British-made components for
samarium-cobalt top bearings to Iraq last year, criminal justice officials
said. On the last day of the fourth inspection, Iraq claimed it had
manufactured 50 top bearings, but when the inspectors left for Vienna they
had seen only a single top bearing, and no manufacturing equipment for
making the bearings.

Al Qaqaa for Missile Testing?

   Western intelligence reports in 1990 stated that the Al Qaqaa State
Establishment, located about 30 miles south of Baghdad, was ''concerned
with the development of the nonnuclear components of a nuclear weapon''
(NuclearFuel, 21 Jan., 3). But, according to the IAEA, Iraq has given a
''plausible alternative explanation'' for secret work going on at Al
Qaqaa.
   At Al Qaqaa, Iraqi experts had been working on bridge wires--a crucial
electronic component which can be used for precise detonation of high
explosives in a nuclear implosion device. According to Iraqi officials,
however, the bridge wires were being developed at Al Qaqaa for so-called
fire-set components to separate missile stages within time tolerances of
0.5 microseconds. Iraqi officials also stated that experts had been working
on development of so-called RDX explosives and metal cast explosives, and
had imported hundreds of tons of the explosive known as HMX. These
explosives can be used in a nuclear weapon.
   For any nuclear weapon, Iraq would probably need a steady supply of
polonium-210, which is used with a small amount of beryllium as a neutron
initiator (NW, 25 July, 12). Sources said that evidence of production of
Po-210, which has a half-life of only 138 days, would serve as ''indirect
confirmation'' that Iraq was working on nuclear explosives. IAEA inspectors
found no indication of Po-210 production or handling at the Tuwaitha
Nuclear Research Center, Al Qaqaa, or two facilities for materials research
and high explosives testing, Al Atheer and Al Musayyaib. However, Jaffar
told IAEA officials during the fourth inspection that Iraq had made ''small
quantities'' of Po-210 for ''steady-state ion sources.''

USSR OFFERS UP RBMKS TO SCRUTINY OF WORLD SAFETY EXPERTS, VIA IAEA

By:
Ann MacLachlan, Vienna

   The Soviet Union has proposed that the international community conduct a
safety review of its RBMK graphite-moderated channel-type reactors in a new
program managed by the IAEA. The offer, made at an international safety
conference in Vienna last week, marks the first time the Soviets have been
willing to subject design and operation of the Chernobyl-type units to
international scrutiny.
   The USSR's existing 16 RBMK units provide about half of the country's
nuclear-generated electricity. But their safety systems and basic design,
even after post-Chernobyl backfitting, are considered by some in the West
as insufficient to justify long-term operation.
   The Soviet offer was endorsed by the experts who were meeting in Vienna
to set a nuclear safety strategy for the next decade (see related story,
this issue), and it seemed sure to be accepted by the IAEA Board of
Governors at the end of this week and the agency's general conference,
which convenes Monday, September 16. It would be modeled on the IAEA's
''Study of the Safety of Older Reactors,'' a safety review of
first-generation Soviet-design VVER (PWR) units in central and eastern
Europe, which is due to wind up this fall.
   Lars Hoegberg, director of the Swedish Nuclear Inspectorate (SKI),
estimated that an RBMK safety study of the same scope as the VVER study
would require tens of engineering man-hours and up to $200,000 per unit
examined.
   The Russians evidently believe their channel reactors will pass muster
after completion of a five-year program of safety improvements and upgrades
following the 1986 accident at Chernobyl. They hope that an international
stamp of approval will allow them to finish RBMK units whose construction
was frozen in the wake of the Chernobyl accident.
   Separately, a senior Soviet official said regulators expect to rule by
October on whether first-generation RBMK units can resume operation at full
power. The Committee for State Supervision of Safety in Industry & Nuclear
Power (CSSSINP) imposed a ceiling of 70% power operation in June 1990
because of concerns about the consequences of a fuel-damage accident at the
older plants if they operated at full power (NW, 12 July '90, 1). But
committee deputy chairman Anatoly Belyaev told Nucleonics Week last week
that the Ministry of Atomic Power & Industry (MAPI), which operates Soviet
nuclear reactors, is about to submit to the regulators a technical study
aimed at proving that the consequences of a severe core-damage accident
would not be higher at 100% than at 70% power.
   Belyaev said the ministry had stressed, in debating the RBMK matter with
the safety committee, that operating at reduced power means lower revenues
for the power plants and thus ''eventually reduces the capability to
improve safety at those plants.'' MAPI had officially committed to invest
all additional income from full-power operation in improving safety at the
units, Belyaev said. ''We understand their arguments and are trying to
listen to them,'' he said. He cited ''very important changes'' made
recently to the first large RBMK at Leningrad, including rebuilding of
pressure tubes, which had kept Leningrad-1 off line for nearly two years,
and said similar backfits were planned at other RBMKs.
   ''The energy supply situation is still very difficult'' in the USSR,
Belyaev said. ''We would like to make a final decision (on the RMBK
full-power operation) no later than October if there's enough evidence.''
   The Soviet proposal for an RBMK safety review program was aired by
Andrei Gagarinski, deputy director of the Kurchatov Atomic Energy
Institute, on behalf of MAPI. The program would encompass work that is just
about to begin between safety experts in the USSR and four western European
countries.
   MAPI first deputy director Viktor Sidorenko wrote August 22 to nuclear
regulatory bodies and safety experts in Germany, Sweden, the U.K., and
Finland to invite them to begin in-depth examination of RBMK safety in a
multilateral effort that would encompass incipient bilateral work. The
experts from those four countries, plus possibly Italy, are scheduled to
meet in Moscow next week to discuss how to proceed.
   Up to now, the western world's influence in the RBMK program has been
limited to certain technical points, such as Gesellschaft fuer
Reaktorsicherheit's (GRS) proposal to try to apply its thermohydraulics
codes to RBMK accidents. The Swedish Nuclear Power Inspectorate (SKI)
recently signed an agreement with CSSSINP to study the safety of BWRs,
while the U.K. Atomic Energy Authority has been discussing points of common
interest concerning graphite-moderated reactors.

International Financing Assumed

   It is assumed that any changes deemed necessary in the RBMKs after
international scrutiny--like those now being worked out under a European
Community program for the old Kozloduy VVERs in Bulgaria--would have to be
funded through borrowing from international institutions like the World
Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction & Development.
   Last year, the International Advisory Committee (IAC) of senior nuclear
experts underlined the large contribution of the Soviet-design reactors to
total world nuclear power risk and recommended that, if national
governments cannot fund them completely, then safety-necessary backfits
should be supported by the west's nuclear industry and governments most
interested in preserving the nuclear option (NW, 20 Sept. '90, 2).
More recently, at the Andrei Sakharov Memorial Conference held in Moscow in
late May, an international expert panel recommended ''urgently'' that
further operation of the RBMK units ''be recognized as a temporary
emergency measure.''
   Both the IAC and the Sakharov panel estimated that the risk of a severe
accident with major off-site consequences from the Soviet-design reactors
was as high as 50% over five years.
   Meanwhile, Lithuanian independence poses special questions around the
Ignalina RBMK station in that Baltic nation. The Ignalina units--two
operating and one in suspended construction--are the only RBMKs outside the
Russian Federation, but they are also the biggest ones, at unit electric
power of 1,500 megawatts for a core the same size as the 1,000-MW Chernobyl
units. They produce a substantial share of Lithuania's electricity and
could help generate export revenues for the republic. Following the
recognition of Lithuania by the Nordic states, close cooperation on RBMK
safety and nuclear safety supervision is expected to be put in place by
Sweden and Finland.

CZECHS WERE FORCED TO TAKE UNITS THEY KNEW WERE BELOW-STANDARD

By:
Ann MacLachlan, Vienna

   Czechoslovakia's senior nuclear regulator said last week his country
knew from the beginning that the reactors it imported from the USSR in the
1970s did not meet prevailing nuclear safety requirements, but could do
nothing about it. He painted a stark picture of the situation of former
USSR satellites, forced by politics to accept nuclear power plants they
realized were below standards in force at the time in the West.
   Zdenek Kriz, chief inspector of the Czechoslovak Atomic Energy
Commission, told a meeting of international nuclear safety experts at the
IAEA in Vienna that the decision to buy two VVER-440 units at Bohunice from
the Soviet Union ''was a purely political decision made by our government.
Safety was not a criterion. There was no tender, no discussion about
safety'' before the sale, he said. The decision involved ''acceptance of
the philosophy of the Soviet vendor, which at that time differed
significantly from U.S. (safety) criteria,'' Kriz said. For example, the
Soviet's defense-in-depth concept stressed accident prevention, and
''suppressed other parts (of the philosophy) partially or totally.'' The
Soviet approach violated the spirit of IAEA nuclear safety standards as
well, he said.
   Later, he said other central and eastern countries had been in the same
situation, and his remarks were meant to speak for all of them.
   Karel Wagner, chairman of the Czech Atomic Energy Commission, later told
Nucleonics Week that the eastern Europeans ''did a lot of things that were
not up to western standards'' in the years they spent as satellites of the
USSR.
   ''The role of safety regulation was fully underestimated in our country
and others,'' Kriz said.
   Czechoslovakia passed a law on state supervision of nuclear power in
1984. ''But the two units (Bohunice-1 and -2, the early-design VVER-440s)
were commissioned in 1978 and 1980. The law came too late,'' Kriz said.
   ''From the beginning we were aware of the situation. Both operators and
the regulatory body made many efforts to enhance safety and improve the
situation'' at Bohunice, Kriz recounted. The ''most important obstacle,''
he said, was that, since all significant changes had to be approved by the
vendor, ''people said the vendor country was responsible for safety.''
   A series of backfits was proposed to the Czech government in 1986. ''But
we were aware the problem was not solved,'' Kriz said.
   During the past year, Kriz said, the Czech Nuclear Inspectorate
conducted ''a very extensive'' 10th-year safety assessment of the Bohunice
units, advised by a government commission, and ruled that they should be
upgraded over two years. The program, Kriz said, costs about one-quarter
the units' original price and is the prerequisite for their operation to
1995. At that time, the operator either will propose further measures to
bring the units up to acceptable safety levels or will have to shut them.
   Wagner said that 60 of the proposed improvements are already made, and,
of the 81 still to be realized, 17 should be finished by the end of this
year and the others in 1992. Thereafter, the units will undergo yearly
regulatory review to 1995, with yearly extensions of their operating
licenses if they pass muster.
   After 1995, Wagner said, the two units must shut down unless their owner
agrees to backfit a ''proven substitute for containment'' that includes a
special primary circuit pressure suppression system and a large inventory
of primary coolant. Wagner reckons that the ''only way'' to do this is to
add ''some type of barbotage'' system similar to the bubbler-tower
condenser systems that were added to the design for second-generation
VVER-440s such as Bohunice-3 and -4.
   The initial Bohunice units represent ''a young station,'' Wagner said,
''with only 10 and 12 years of operation, or less than half their expected
design life. They could operate another 10 years'' if they are
appropriately backfit, he observed.
   Kriz told the Vienna meeting that ''although we are aware that the
safety level (of Bohunice) is lower than that at other PWRs, we, the
regulatory body, took our responsibility and defined measures that must be
fulfilled by the operator'' at Bohunice.
   ''I assure you,'' he told the IAEA delegates, ''that we are fully aware
that responsibility (for the Bohunice units' safety) is in our hands. We
must achieve a level of safety acceptable for all in the world.''

EDF AND SIEMENS TO BID TOGETHER ON KOZLODUY DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS

By:
Ann MacLachlan, Paris

   Electricite de France (EDF) and Siemens have formed a joint venture to
bid on design studies of improving the Kozloduy nuclear power plant in
Bulgaria in the framework of the European Commission/World Association of
Nuclear Operators (EC/WANO) program of aid to the Bulgarian nuclear
operators.
   The joint venture agreement, which links Siemens and EDF's subsidiary
EDF International, was signed at the end of July. An EDF official said that
the consortium agreement runs only for the length of the EC short-term
program for Kozloduy; that is, to the end of this year. Nevertheless, the
EC/WANO program could be extended into 1992, and in that case the
EDF-Siemens venture could also be lengthened.
   Any initiative past the Kozloduy work, however, would imply creation of
a new consortium or conclusion of an annex to the present consortium
contract, the EDF official said.
   The two companies will reply to a bid solicitation from the Bulgarian
Energy Committee, which is managing the Kozloduy improvement program from
Sofia's side. The first of four first-generation Soviet-design PWRs at the
site in northwestern Bulgaria was shut September 4 for near-term upgrades
and a second unit is scheduled to be shut shortly.
   The EDF official said that the initiative for the consortium came from
Siemens because of EDF's ''excellent contacts'' with the Bulgarian Energy
Committee. The French utility had agreed with the Bulgarians in early June,
before international attention was focused on Kozloduy after an IAEA audit
found serious safety deficiencies at the plant, on ''active twinning''
between Kozloduy and EDF's Bugey nuclear power plant, and EDF staff were at
Kozloduy by the end of August.
   On the other hand, said the EDF official, the French ''lacked
knowledge'' of the VVER-440 reactor design, which could be supplied by
Siemens because of its work on VVER-440s at Greifswald in the former German
Democratic Republic.
   The EDF-Siemens accord has raised some eyebrows in France, where reactor
vendor Framatome and EDF, as two monopolies, are condemned to get along
with each other. But Framatome could not counter EDF's argument of Siemens'
greater experience with the VVER reactor type. Moreover, it is no secret
that the Germans have far closer industrial contacts in central and eastern
Europe. If Siemens sees EDF as key to closer contact with the Bulgarian
energy production establishment--and perhaps counterparts in other eastern
European countries--the German company may be one card for EDF to play in
its drive to take positions in foreign markets. If the ''trial balloon'' of
the Kozloduy partnership works well, the EDF official said, the experiment
could well be extended into other markets behind the former Iron Curtain.

DIABLO CANYON-2 BREAKS RECORD FOR LWR CONTINUOUS OPERATION

   On August 30, Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s Diablo Canyon-2 broke by one
day the LWR continuous operation record set in July by GPU Nuclear's Three
Mile Island-1. However, Wolf Creek may break the new record this week.
   Diablo Canyon-2 shut down after 481 days of operation, 10 days short of
its planned September 9 refueling outage, because of a leak in the reactor
coolant system. TMI-1 had broken the 477-day record, set by Omaha Public
Power District's Fort Calhoun in 1988, by three days but then scrammed
automatically because of a test procedure failure (NW, 1 Aug., 16).
   Wolf Creek, owned by Kansas Gas & Electric Co., Kansas City Power &
Light Co., and Kansas Electric Power Cooperative, reached 478 days of
continuous operation on September 10 and was still running. It is not
scheduled to shut for refueling until September 19, giving it the
opportunity to run 487 days. All are PWRs: Diablo Canyon-2 and Wolf Creek
from Westinghouse; TMI-1 from Babcock & Wilcox; Fort Calhoun, from
Combustion Engineering.
   Another kind of record is being claimed by Commonwealth Edison for its
Byron station: the longest continuous U.S. run for both units of a two-unit
station. The two Westinghouse units were both on line for just over 258
days, from December 21, 1990 to September 6.
   A review of recent operations of two-unit stations as reported to
Nucleonics Week found the longest run internationally was chalked up in
1990, when both Asea-Atom BWRs at Sweden's Barsebaeck station ran together
for 335 days. However, since statistics have not always been kept on
two-unit station runs, there may be longer runs not reported.

NOTES PERTAINING TO THE GENERATING TABLE FOR JULY 1991

   Cattenom-4 is being added to the table this month. The 1,362-MW PWR,
operated by Electricite de France, achieved criticality May 4 and generated
its first electricity May 27. It is in precommercial testing and is
scheduled for commissioning before the end of the year.
   This month, statistics from all countries but Britain are reported on
the basis of 744 hours. In Britain, units owned by Nuclear Electric and
Scottish Nuclear are both reported for 672 hours. For the year-to-date,
statistics are based on 5,087 hours of operation through July 31 in Europe
and the U.S., except Britain's Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, whose
figures are based on 5,039 hours. Figures from all other countries are
based on 5,088 hours.
   Belgium's Doel-3 was down for 287.18 hours for refueling.
   In Brazil, Angra-1 was down for 26.5 hours for repair of the heating
line of the steam generator 1A feed pump on the secondary side.
   Britain's Hunterston B-1 continued in shutdown the entire month for its
statutory biennial outage. Torness-1 was down 136 hours for its statutory
biennial outage and 27 hours for a turbine/reactor trip. Torness-2 was down
for 336 hours for refueling.
   In Canada, Pickering-3 restarted after being shut since 1989 for fuel
channel replacement. Pickering-5 was down for 675 hours for repair of a
generator hydrogen leak. Bruce-1 was forced down for 520.7 hours due to a
boiler (steam generator) tube leak. Darlington-2 continued in its forced
outage all month to repair cracked end plates.
   In France, Electricite de France's nuclear plants generated 22.4-billion
kilowatt-hours (KWH), or about 71% of total French electricity produced in
July. EDF's 900-MW PWR series averaged 71.6% energy availability
(capability factor) during the month and 74.2% over the 12 months ended
July 31. During the month, the 900-MW-class units averaged unavailability
of 18.5% for scheduled refueling and maintenance and 9.9% for unscheduled
downtime, of which 4.4% was forced outages caused by equipment problems.
   The utility's 1,300-MW PWR series had average energy availability of
57.6% in July and 72.2% over the 12 preceding months. Their unavailability
during the month was due 14.6% to scheduled outages and 27.8% to
unscheduled outages, with 11% of the latter classified as forced outage.
   EDF classified 13 incidents on the French nuclear event scale during the
month, two of them at Level 2 and the others at Level 1:
   --Belleville-2, which had a Level 2 event in May, had another, unrelated
one July 10, when 10 cubic meters of non-borated water were injected by
mistake into the reactor coolant system (RCS) because of an error in
estimating the level of water in a feed tank that had been used for a test.
Although the average boron concentration of the RCS remained above
specified limits at all times, the incident was classified at Level 2
because of its potential safety consequences.
   --The problem of peeling paint on the inside walls of containment sumps,
discovered the previous month, was reclassified from Level 1 to Level 2
because a check showed it had affected a significant number of units in the
1,300-MW PWR series. However, by mid-August EDF had remedied the peeling
problem.
   --At St. Alban-2 on July 1, a fuel handling incident put a fuel assembly
off balance, causing its head to strike the head of another assembly. The
two assemblies were removed to the fuel building for inspection.
   --At Tricastin-2 on July 1, deterioration of a main coolant pump seal
caused the pump to trip and the reactor to scram. About 300 cubic meters of
primary coolant leaked onto the reactor building floor.
   --At Tricastin-3 on July 4, reactor protection signals from one of the
four ionization chambers were discovered to be unavailable because of
incorrect wiring in the associated data processing system. The anomaly was
not revealed during the usual periodic testing of the measuring device but
during maintenance on the electric cabinet where the signals are produced.
   --The volume of primary coolant at Gravelines-5 on July 5 was found to
be about 10 cubic meters lower than required. This happened because the
reactor vessel vent valve, which allows expulsion of air during RCS
filling, had remained closed, leading to formation of an air cushion under
the vessel head and an erroneous measurement of primary coolant level.
   --The boron concentration in a tank of the auxiliary boron circuit at
Chinon-B1 fell below the required level July 7, and operators took nine
hours longer to rectify it than is required by technical specifications.
The incident was traced to a failure of level alarms to switch on while
another tank was being filled.
   --At Tricastin-3 on July 12, a fuel handling incident caused slight
deformation of a fuel assembly. The fuel element was being lowered slowly
towards the upending device of the fuel storage pool when by mistake the
operation was switched to high speed. Although the operator stopped the
maneuver immediately, the leg of the fuel element ended up pressing against
the upending device and the element was slanted about 10 degrees off
vertical.
   --Paluel-1 was off line with fuel discharged on July 17 when, during
planned maintenance on a switch, a second switch was opened by mistake,
interrupting the off-site power source. The second diesel generator
switched in immediately.
   --An electric distribution panel on one power supply train was rendered
unavailable at Gravelines-5 July 19 because of a mixup in preparing
maintenance on the other train. This caused startup of an emergency diesel.
At the same time, spent fuel pool cooling was interrupted for about two
hours, leading to a rise in pool temperature of about 4 degrees C, although
it remained within prescribed limits. The maintenance file was revised to
avoid recurrence of such an incident.
   --An alarm indicating too-low boron concentration (below 2,000 ppm) in
the Dampierre-2 RCS on July 24 was not taken into account until six hours
after it appeared. However, the concentration remained above the level of
1,950 ppm covered by safety studies.
   --One of the two pumps of the residual heat removal system at
Flamanville-1 had to be stopped for 90 minutes on July 25 due to the
passage of an air pocket through the pump. The pocket had been entrained
from a pipe into the pump when a valve was opened.
   --Operators took 50 minutes too long to stop Nogent-2 on July 29
following a leak of primary coolant that exceeded the regulatory operating
limit of 230 liters per hour. The plant had been kept operating for three
hours after the leak was detected at the request of the power dispatcher.
Nogent operators expected to need only one hour to stop the reactor
(technical specifications require a reactor to be stopped four hours after
detection of a primary coolant leak), but it actually took one hour and 50
minutes.
   Pre-commercial testing resumed at Cattenom-4 on July 22; the unit had
been down since June 12 for work on a reactor scram control train and
repair of a defective nozzle on the low-pressure safety injection system.
Bugey-2 restarted July 26; it had been down since April 6 for refueling and
maintenance, but it was taken down again July 27 and 28 for work on a
6.6-kilovolt electric cable. Bugey-3 restarted July 1 following completion
of work on high-pressure turbine steam pipe supports. The unit was stopped
again July 19 at the end of its regular duty cycle in anticipation of the
programmed refueling outage.
   Cattenom-3 restarted July 10; it had been down since June 27 for repairs
to a low-pressure safety injection system nozzle. The unit was down again
July 28-30 for work on a main coolant pump.
   Chinon-B3 was down July 27-28 for work in the reactor building. Cruas-1
came back on line July 4 following completion of its fifth-year inspection
and refueling outage, which began March 30. It was down again July 4-15 for
work on generator exciter control cabinets. Cruas-2 was down July 25-26 for
work on the generator hydrogen system. Nogent-1 was taken down July 27 for
work on thecooling modules of the atmospheric cooling tower. Nogent-2 was
taken down July 29 for work on a valve part of an RCS auxiliary system.
Paluel-3 remained down (since June 29) for work on the sumps of the reactor
building and nozzles on the safety injection and containment spray systems.
Penly-1 was down July 20-21 for work on the nuclear island fire protection
system. St. Alban-1 was down July 5-15 for repairs to a defective nozzle on
the containment spray system. Tricastin-2 was down July 1-25 for work on
main coolant pump seals.
   The Creys-Malville breeder reactor remained down for various work
associated with purification of primary sodium and review of operating and
management measures by French safety authorities. The prototype breeder
Phenix, owned by the Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique, also remained off
line following the reactivity drop incident of fall 1990.
   Gravelines-2 remained down (since May 11) for its 10th-year inspection
and refueling outage. Gravelines-5 remained down (since June 29) for its
fifth-year inspection and refueling, as did Chinon-B2 (since May 18). St.
Laurent-B1, down since January 19 for refueling and maintenance, restarted
July 1. The St. Laurent-A2 gas-cooled reactor was taken down July 31 for
its annual inspection.
   Bugey-1, a gas-cooled reactor, remained off line since June 24 because
of low electricity demand. Dampierre-2 was taken down July 15 after
completion of its duty cycle in anticipation of scheduled refueling.
Flamanville-1 was taken down July 4 at the end of its duty cycle and began
scheduled refueling/maintenance on July 29.
   Units off line all or part of the month for regular refueling and
maintenance included Belleville-2, Blayais-3, Cattenom-1, Dampierre-1,
Dampierre-3, Fessenheim-2, Paluel-1, Paluel-2, Tricastin-3, and St.
Alban-2.
   Hungary's Paks-1 returned July 16 from routine refueling and
maintenance, and Paks-3 was shut for its annual refueling/maintenance the

INDEX, NEDS ARE OPERATING.

A box on page 9 of the Special Report, ''Outlook on Security,'' included
with the June 27 issue of Nucleonics Week, incorrectly said neither the
Integrated Nuclear Data Exchange (INDEX) or the Nuclear Employee Data
System (NEDS) had ''received enough industry support to survive alone.''
Both are now active. INDEX is a consortium of 14 nuclear utilities that
share a computer data base listing some 20,000 reactor outage workers who
meet NRC standards for plant access as temporary workers. INDEX is headed
by Hollis Hutchison, nuclear personnel manager of Texas Utilities Co., and
has offices at 150 South Spring Lake Drive, Itasca IL 60143, (708)
825-3000. NEDS has been taken over and is being revived by GPU Nuclear
Corp. as a for-sale service, not a membership consortium. According to Chip
Fenton, GPU director of human resources and head of NEDS, NEDS has
''letters of intent'' to join from seven other utilities, chiefly in the
northeast. Fenton is reachable at GPU Nuclear Corp., One Upper Pond Road,
Parsippany NJ 07054, (201) 316-7044.

SEVERAL FUELS ISSUES REMAIN TIED-UP IN BUDGET DEBATE

      A number of issues important to the refining and marketing
industry remain unresolved as Congress and the White House negotiated
over the budget and the federal government remained closed last week. 
The U.S. EPA remains unfunded, operating with a minimal staff, and
officials at the Agency warned that they're unable to enforce
environmental statutes.
      The Clinton Administration and Congressional Republicans appear
to be far apart on a number of issues, including the taxable status of
kerosene for home heating and the depreciation schedule for
convenience stores operating in conjunction with gasoline stations.
      Due to lack of appropriations for EPA, funds have also run out
for the Federal Leaking Underground Storage Trust Fund (LUST) and the
Superfund Trust Fund.  Below is a review of programs and tax issues
affected by the Washington, D.C., stalemate, including federal motor
fuels taxes as of Jan. 1 that may still be changed under final federal
budget programs.

Clinton Seeks Tax On Kerosene For Home Use

      One provision of a White House budget proposal would impose a
tax on kerosene mixed with heating oil.  Under the current law,
kerosene is subject to the 24.4 c/gal diesel fuel tax when it is mixed
with dyed, on-road diesel fuel.  It is not subject to the tax when it
is distributed to be used in home heating oil, as it is often in the
Northeast to ensure that the fuel does not gel.
      The White House is pursuing the change because "some wholesale
distributors of diesel fuel have not been paying the tax on kerosene
that they blend with diesel fuel for highway use," according to a
White House memo.  "As a result, the government is losing tax revenues
and complying taxpayers are at a competitive disadvantage."
      The Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of America (SIGMA)
concurs with the Administration on the kerosene tax.  "People are
using the kerosene for fuel, and that is a form of tax evasion -- and
we are always against tax evasion," said SIGMA counsel Tim Columbus.
      Another gasoline marketer association, Petroleum Marketers
Association of America (PMAA),  is "totally opposed to this," said
PMAA spokesman David Morehead.  "This is not something we want to
allow to slip through."  PMAA is encouraging its members to contact
their Congressmen on the issue. 
      House and Senate members from Northeast states have sent letters
to Senate Majority leader Bob Dole (R-KS), asking him to oppose
Clinton's proposal.  "This would be an extremely regressive tax that
would have its greatest impact on low-income consumers of home heating
oil, many of whom live in trailer parks and cannot afford any increase
in fuel costs," the House letter read.
      "[The Clinton Administration] is charging that this is a tax-
break for businesses. We think this is a good business deduction,"
Morehead said.  "[Clinton is] taking the issue almost personally." 
      Taxation of aviation jet fuel also hangs in the balance.  On
Oct. 1, 1995, the Treasury began to collect the 4.3 c/gal tax on jet
fuel that had been exempted from the 1993 increase in the federal
fuels excise tax.  Extension of that exemption was included in the
Congressional budget bill that was vetoed last month, but it remains
on the table as part of the budget negotiations.

Congress Wants New Depreciation For C-Stores; Clinton Opposes

      A provision in the budget bill passed by Congress and vetoed by
the president last month would give convenience store (c-store) owners
that do more than 50% of their business in motor fuels and related
services the same 15-year depreciation schedule that gasoline stations
have.  Currently, those c-stores must use a 39.5-year depreciation
schedule.
      SIGMA, PMAA and the National Association of Convenience Stores
(NACS) support quicker depreciation.  Acknowledging that the Clinton
Administration has opposed the new schedule, Lindsay Hutter, NACS
spokeswoman, argues, "It has not been an issue of great contention in
the budget debate.
      "We have had the commitment of the Republican leadership on this
issue," Hutter said.  "We continue to be very hopeful -- this is our
number one issue."  

Tax For LUST Fund Expires, Extension of Tax Unlikely

      The 0.1 c/gal gasoline tax used to finance the LUST fund expired
on Dec. 31, and it appears no major effort is underway to restore it. 
Approximately $800 million is now in the trust fund, but it is not
being properly disbursed for cleanups, according to PMAA's Morehead. 
"Money in the LUST fund is just sitting there --  it hasn't been spent
very vigorously," he said.
      As for the tax, "we say 'let it expire' because the money is not
being used for what it should be used for," said Morehead.  PMAA might
favor restoration of the tax if the money was distributed to the
states, he said.  
      "SIGMA and NACS may try to reposition the LUST, but we would
want the federal government to give the money to the states, provided
they would use it for cleanup costs," concurred Columbus.

Superfund Tax Expires;  Lack Of Appropriations Slows Cleanups

      The tax collected for the Superfund Trust fund also expired as
of Dec. 31.  The $9.7 c/bbl, or $0.0023 c/gal, tax is not currently
being collected, but it will almost certainly be re-imposed
retroactively, according to Capitol Hill sources.
      In the meantime, the Superfund program is undergoing a partial
shutdown due to the lack of an EPA appropriations bill.  The trust
fund currently has a surplus of $4 billion, but it is receiving no new
revenue, according to Paul Hirsch of the Chemical Manufacturers
Association (CMA).
      "Work is continuing at sites where construction has started,"
Hirsch said, noting that there are two types of sites: those where the
government is performing the cleanup and those where the liable
parties are cleaning the site.  Liable parties will continue their
clean-up efforts.
      While some EPA Superfund employees are furloughed, the majority
of clean-up is performed by outside contractors, many of which are
still being paid through the trust fund, Hirsch said.  "The government
isn't going to ask those contractors to pick up their shovels and
leave," he said.  At sites that present an immediate threat to human
health, removal work will definitely continue.
      EPA officials offer a less optimistic view, saying that the lack
of funding will likey shut down most of the Superfund program.  The
agency is in the process of furloughing approximately 2,400 agency
workers and 10,000 contractors in the program.  EPA officials did
confirm that cleanup will continue at approximately 100 emergency
sites.

TOSCO BRACES ITSELF FOR COLD RECEPTION AT MARCUS HOOK

      BP is shutting down shop at Marcus Hook, PA, after an
overwhelming 83% rejection last Thursday of new owner Tosco's proposed
labor contract by union workers; and now Tosco says the prospect of
restarting the cold 185,000 b/d plant may prove too chilly to
contemplate. 
      Since buying the Marcus Hook plant and a retail system from BP
last November for $75 million, plus the $160 million value of the
inventories, Tosco expects to assume a cold refinery Feb. 1, when it
takes possession of the plant.
      "Since the union voted to reject the Tosco proposal, we are
continuing plans to suspend operations at Marcus Hook beginning in
mid-January and transferring the suspended operations over to Tosco on
February 1," said BP spokesperson Marian Lowes, declining to comment
on the unit's current utilization. 
      "We failed to reach an agreement with the union," said Jefferson
Allen, Tosco spokesman.  "Although that does mean we can now hire new
employees, it doesn't mean that we will open the plant ever.  We
expected to acquire an operating refinery, but we must now reevaluate
the costs and benefits of running the plant."
      For now, Tosco expects to use its 215,000- b/d Bayway, NJ,
refinery to supply the retail system in the Northeast it will also
acquire from BP.  "We've reached no conclusions about what we're going
to do," Allen added. 
      The plant's union, which represents 320 of its 520 employees,
sharply criticized the Tosco proposal presented on Dec. 31, and denied
that the company made any attempt to bargain.  "It has taken labor
relations back 30-40 years," charged Bob Burdick, International OCAW
representative.  "The document was not negotiated, it was issued by
the company.  Tosco refused to negotiate." 
      Nevertheless, the plant's union agreed to hold a secret ballot
vote on the plan last Thursday, at Tosco's request.  Chief among the
union's complaints with the proposal is the inclusion of mandated
selective hiring, which would "totally negate seniority -- a very
important subject for unions," explained Burdick. Also, the plan would
remove 30 positions from the union's collective bargaining group, lay
off 65 hourly-wage union members,  and eliminate 654 salaried
management-type positions.  It would allow some supervisors and other
salaried employees to bid on union jobs.    
      After the union membership rejected the plan, with only 16.8%
voting in favor of it, the shop steward said the negotiations are now
in Tosco's hands.  "The membership is not willing to go to work under
these conditions," said Cathy Brady, Marcus Hook OCAW shop steward.
      Employees at two of Tosco's other three refineries are also
represented by OCAW, and Burdick contends Tosco's Marcus Hook proposal
compares unfavorably with the union-Tosco contracts at Avon, WA, and
Ferndale, CA.  "This contract is much different and much more
stringent," he said.  "The management-rights clause in the Marcus Hook
proposal gives Tosco almost unlimited power, which is not normal for
such a clause.  Normally, the company is subject to the conditions of
the union contract."

PIPELINES WARY ABOUT MMT BLENDS

      Though Ethyl Corp. has received regulatory approval to market
MMT in the U.S., pipeline operators have yet to embrace the
introduction of yet another fuel additive into an already-stressed
transportation system.  No pipeline has yet changed its gasoline
specification to accomodate MMT blends, though none have indicated
opposition to the additive, either.
      Colonial Pipeline, the key mover of gasoline from the Gulf Coast
to the East, has requested input from its shippers as to whether it
should develop a set of specifications for MMT-blended gasoline. 
"Some shippers have indicated to us that they are not interested in
MMT," said William Copenhaver of Colonial.  "We're just trying to be
cautious." 
      Colonial is not suggesting that it has found technical problems
in shipping MMT-blended gasoline, said Copenhaver, only that it's
trying to understand the needs of its market.  The pipeline system
would allow a segregated shipment of MMT-blended gasoline now, but
Copenhaver said he is unaware of any customer requests.
      MMT, which can be blended only into conventional gasoline, will
be added at the refinery gate, according to Ethyl.  This creates a
"Catch 22" situation: Getting the support of common-carrier pipelines
is essential to broad market acceptance of MMT, but those pipelines
may withhold their support until the market demands the product.  In
response, Ethyl has contacted pipelines and supports the polling of
customers about their MMT plans and concerns, said Ethyl's Technical
Manger, Fuels, Don Hollrah.
      Allowing MMT blends into the fungible system would require
Colonial to add another entire set of gasoline grades, which it is
loath to do on top of the series of gasoline and diesel grades created
in response to new environmental regulations since 1993.
      Responses are due from shippers by Jan. 12, and Colonial will
announce its intentions "soon after," said Copenhaver.  This decision
will set the tone for other pipelines, add industry sources.

ENERGY BIOSYSTEMS PATENTS DESULFURIZATION BREAKTHROUGHS 

      A breakthrough in Energy BioSystems Corp.'s development of
biocatalytic desulfurization is bringing a six-to-eight-fold increase
in specific critical intermediate reactions, the company reported,
predicting it will be ready for commercial demonstration in early
1996.  The Houston-based company also received two new process design
patents for its proprietary biocatalytic desulfurization systems (BDS)
that use bacteria to remove sulfur from petroleum. 
      While Energy BioSystems scientists were experienced with the
interplay of three factors in the intermediate reactions,  the recent
enhancements in the process reflect the company's greater mastery over
a fourth factor discovered in September.   Company scientists are now
working to determine what effect the more prolific reactions will have
on the overall sulfur yield. 
      More development is required on a final reaction to produce the
prototype biocatalyst necessary for pilot plant demonstrations planned
for middle distillate streams at one of Total Petroleum's refineries,
the company said.  BDS will be later be applied to crude, naphtha and
other gasoline components. 
      As for Energy BioSystems' newest patents, the first (U.S. No.
5,472,875) claims a new reactor design by which air or oxygen-enriched
gas is introduced into the oil prior to treatment with the
biocatalyst.  The second patent (U.S. No. 5,468,626) claims a method
by which a biosorption agent preferentially absorbs sulfur-containing
compounds from petroleum.  Such a process design could reduce the size
of the bioreactor by concentrating on those compounds requiring
desulfurization, thus reducing capital equipment costs, the company
reported.

CHEVRON, VENEZUELA'S MARAVEN PARTNERSHIP TO PUSH ASPHALT 

      Maraven S.A. and Chevron Corp. have formed a 20-year alliance
that will bring Chevron substantial crude supplies to run its three
asphalt-oriented refineries in the U.S. and expand its marketing of
asphalt products in the western U.S.  The U.S. partnership is named
Chevron Ven Asphalt Alliance.
      Under the agreement, Chevron will operate Maraven's property in
Venezuela's Boscan oil field and Maraven will in turn supply crude oil
to Chevron's asphalt refineries in Perth Amboy, NJ, Portland, OR, and
Richmond Beach, WA.  "Boscan crude, with an API gravity of 10 degrees,
is an excellent asphalt feedstock," said David O'Reilly, president of
Chevron USA Products Co. 
      Chevron's investment in the heavy oil fields will improve
production from 80,000 b/d today to 115,000 b/d, will reach about $2
billion, the company estimates.

PARAMOUNT PETROLEUM CONTINUES DOWNSTREAM RESTRUCTURING

      Paramount Petroleum launched the next phase of its operations
restructuring to shift its emphasis away from light-end products to
asphalt, jet fuel, diesel fuel and intermediate product refining.  The
company's latest efforts have idled certain downstream units, but
Paramount says it will retain the option of resuming hydro processing. 
"For now it is important that Paramount focus on its core business,
and continue to provide high-quality products and customer service,"
said Jerrel Barto, Paramount chairman.
      Paramount's restructuring began last September when it acquired
EOTT Energy Corp.'s West Coast asphalt marketing operation, senior
management team and technical staff.  At the same time, Paramount
terminated its processing agreement with EOTT, paid off its long-term
debt, entered into a long-term crude oil supply arrangement with EOTT,
obtained long-term financing from Bank of Boston and received a
substantial capital investment from EOTT, Paramount reported.

ASSESSING THE FUTURE OF CNG IN AN RFG WORLD

      Compressed natural gas (CNG) has been studied and tested
extensively as an alternative transportation fuel.  It has beeen used
in passenger car fleets, public transit vehicles and in some heavy-
duty equipment with spark-ignition systems replacing diesel fuel.  But
even so, the public understands the fuel characteristics of RFG and
diesel fuel far better than those of CNG.
      Nevertheless, CNG must be considered as one of the backup
transportation fuels of the next century.  It has the support of the
U.S. Department of Energy and is probably more compatible with the oil
and automobile industries than battery power.  However, as long as
crude oil moves freely in commerce throughout the world, CNG vehicle
development will be slow.  Future RFG, along with advances in
emissions control, can compete environmentally with CNG.

Natural Gas As A Stable Energy Source: Economic Factors

      As a fossil fuel, natural gas follows coal as the most plentiful
energy resource of the U.S.  Crude oil is in a distant third place,
and the U.S. is becoming increasingly dependent on imports.  At the
same time, methane, the major constituent of CNG, can be generated
from coal, tar sands, crude oil and, to some extent, renewable
sources.  It offers long-term stability as an energy source.
      Today, the price of natural gas is set by competition with
residual fuel oil or coal as a burner fuel, and it varies considerably
with geography and season.  As a general rule, CNG is more economic
than RFG despite capital and operating costs for compression. 
Conversions to accomodate CNG are said to average about $4,000 per
passenger or van-type vehicle.
      Fuel economy comparisons between CNG and RFG are confusing at
best.  On a theoretical BTU/gallon basis, CNG has much less to offer
than RFG.  On a BTU/lb of vapor basis, the heat content is more
comparable, but varies with individual CNG and RFG composition.  One
study with Caprice and Crown Victoria taxicabs conducted by Clean Air
Cab Co. indicated CNG "average fuel economy is equal to or better than
gasoline."  The study also also indicated a 20-month payback on
conversions.  

Composition and Emissions Performance

      In general, treated natural gas ranges from 80% to 98% methane,
with varying amounts of ethane, propane, inert gases (carbon dioxide
and nitrogen) and traces of heavier hydrocarbons.  EPA certification
fuel is specified at the bottom of Table I and is more restrictive
than some pipeline gas delivered for heating.  The heavier
hydrocarbons are necessarily limited for CNG due to the danger of
liquid formation.
      CNG's high methane content insures clean burning and a low level
of non-methane emissions.  Heavier hydrocarbons emitted, primarily
ethane and propane, are low in photochemical activity.
      Toxic emissions, such as benzene and 1,3 butadiene, are almost
non-existent, especially when catalytic converter controlled. 
However, the reactivity of emissions from compressed fuel can increase
if the C2 and C3 fractions contain olefins from refinery cracking
operations.  Olefin limits could be set on future CNG certification
fuel as an added environmental control.  (The California Air Resources
Board current limits the amount of propylene in LPG at 10 vol%, to be
reduced to 5 vol% on Jan. 1, 1997.)

Octane Quality

      The octane quality of most CNG compositions exceeds 120 (R+M)/2. 
However, the inherent value of the excess octane is currently lost
because vehicles converted to CNG are not designed with higher
compression engines that could offer additional fuel economy or
greater performance.
      An advanced natural gas vehicle developed by an industry
consortium, headed by Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics
Laboratory, does incorporate a modified small displacement, high-
compression engine.  The compact-sized, four-door sedan is said to
have a 315-mile driving range between refueling and fuel economy of 32
miles per (equivalent) gallon.

Fuel Tanks and Fueling

      Two major disadvantages for CNG passenger cars are the larger
space needed for fuel tanks and the availability of compressed gas for
fueling.  The Johns Hopkins prototype is said to retain 75% of the
original trunk storage space, which means that the rear has been
redesigned for fuel storage and lacks space for a spare tire and jack. 
Instead, the car is equipped with "run flat tires" which can be driven
up to 250 miles with no damage after puncture.
      Fueling time and availability is a major problem that needs
resolution before the average motorist can become serious about CNG,
and limited fleet operations can be expanded.
      Yet, in a world that would place a significant number of CNG
vehicles on the road, solutions can be visualized.  For example,
natural gas available through conventional systems for industrial and
home heating could be the fuel source.  Compression equipment and
tankage could be installed at large service stations or vehicle repair
shops.  Also, it is conceivable that compressors and small tanks could
be installed in the home garage, assuming safety problems could be
resolved.
      However, in the home-supply case, the gas delivered through the
heating system would need to meet CNG fuel specifications.  Natural
gas for home heating contains a minute amount of odorant, such as
mercaptan sulfur.  The material is added to facilitate leak detection
and could probably be removed with a filtering device connected to the
compression equipment.

Long-Range Outlook

      Prospects are slim for a CNG share of vehicle transportation
from the average motorist.  He or she is not likely to trade fueling
convenience and trunk space for lower-cost mileage.  Further, the
economic advantage for CNG over RFG would probably be lost (through
rising demand and added road taxes) if gas-powered vehicles were
mandated in critical air pollution areas such as the Los Angeles
Basin.  Also, as long as zero-emission vehicles are scheduled and
mandated in California, the major emphasis of automakers will be on
development of battery-powered cars.
      Future RFG, along with more extensive catalytic conversion, is
also competition for CNG from the standpoint of cost-effective
emissions reductions.
      On the other hand, as long as fuel economics favor CNG and
facilitate a short-term payout of conversion equipment, as well as
offer long-term, low-cost mileage, compressed gas will be attractive
for fleet operation -- especially in critical air pollution zones. 
Therefore, CNG and CNG vehicles can be viewed as a niche market that
will experience gradual growth.

SANCTIONS AGAINST NIGERIA COULD SEND OIL PRICES SOARING

      Elimination of Nigeria's oil production from world markets
through a boycott would push oil prices sharply higher and have a
particularly severe impact on heating oil and diesel fuel because of
the uniquely high distillate nature of Nigerian crudes, said Cheryl
Trench, executive vice president, Petroleum Industry Research
Foundation (New York, NY).  OECD countries, led by the U.S., would be
most affected, as they account for 90% of Nigeria's export market, or
more than 1.5 million b/d.
      "As everybody is well aware, this is not an issue under hot
debate in the U.S. right now," said Trench.  "But it is under
consideration in the U.S. Congress and internationally."
      With the world having perhaps 3.5 million b/d of spare oil
production capacity today, two-thirds of that in Saudi Arabia, Trench
believes that prices would rise during the substantial time lag before
supplies were redistributed around the world in accordance with
demand.  "Even if  it were, however, the incremental crude would not
match the quality of Nigerian crudes, with their high yields of light
products in general, and particularly high yield of gasoil," she
wrote.
      The last time when light crudes were at a premium, during the
U.S. Operation Desert Storm, refiners that had to use heavy crudes
wound up increasing refinery runs to make up deficits -- and the same
thing would occur in this case.  "Uncertainty over the availability of
incremental supplies will encourage inventory holding, the phenomenon
that unbalanced markets in 1979," she added.
      Even a unilateral embargo by only the U.S. would affect the
market noticeably, Trench predicted.  For one thing, U.S. East Coast
gasoline and heating oil inventories are lower this year than in years
past, so any production shortfall would be felt "quickly and strongly
in product prices."  The redirection of near-substitutes for Nigerian
crude (such as North Sea production) to the U.S. would change trade
patterns and contribute to a widening of crude-grade splits.
      The impact of a boycott in the U.S. would fall
disproportionately on several refiners, PIRF found: Sun, which is 100%
dependent on Nigerian crude to run its Philadelphia refinery complex;
BP, which relies on the crude for 70% of its feed at Marcus Hook, PA,
a facility it is soon turning over to Tosco; and Hess, which uses
large volumes of Nigerian crude at its Virgin Islands complex.

ABB GROUP SCORES SUCCESSES IN FORMER SOVIET UNION

      During the last few months, Switzerland's ABB Group moved ahead
of other Western engineering companies backing the growth of the
refining industry in the former Soviet Union.
      In November, ABB Lummus Global, a division of ABB Group, helped
arrange a $96 million loan from the U.S. Export-Import Bank for
further modernization of a refinery in Perm, Russia.  ABB Lummus will
manage the project, which will expand production of low-aromatics (10
vol%) diesel fuel, increase yield of high-value products and reduce SO2
emissions by 30%.  The refinery is already Russia's top producer of
lubricant oils and has been making an all-unleaded gasoline slate
since March 1993.
      Separately, ABB Simcon signed an agreement with Petrocom of
Moscow, to cooperate in supplying the refining industry with
automation systems, dynamic simulators and related services.

GASOLINE, HEATING OIL PRICES IMPROVE DESPITE INVENTORY BUILDS

      Fuel traders appeared to shake off American Petroleum Institute
(API) data that indicated gasoline and distillate inventories
increased substantially in the last week of 1995, instead driving Gulf
Coast gasoline up nearly 4 c/gal since late December.  For the week
ended Dec. 30, 1995, gasoline inventories incresaed 5.1 million bbl.
      Distillate stocks increased 1.2 million bbl, but that was
entirely due to a rise in on-road diesel, as the cold weather took a
large bit out of heating oil inventories.  As a result, spot prices
for high-sulfur diesel fuel ended last week even with on-road diesel
at 61 c/gal in New York and 55.6 c/gal in Houston.
      Concentrating on a huge drawdown in crude oil inventories of
11.4 million bbl, traders said that the trends of higher product
demand are more important than a one-week fluctuation in product
stocks at a time of year when inventories are sometimes manipulated
for tax purposes.  
      News Friday morning that refinery workers at BP's Marcus Hook,
PA, facility rejected the contract offer by Tosco helped gasoline
prices in the East as the week ended.  If BP proceeds with its
decision to close the refinery in the absence of a new contract when
it turns it over to Tosco on Jan. 31, product from the172,000-b/d
facility would come to a halt.  However, sources indicate that the
plant has been running "at maybe half capacity" for a considerable
period of time and that the new owner, Tosco, could increase
production at its Bayway, NJ, refinery to make up for any shortfalls
from the Marcus Hook plant.
      Also aiding the market late last week were stoppages in some
crude shipments  because of severe winter storms.  Coastal  announced
that its Corpus Christi, TX, refinery was scaling back operations
about 20% due to reduced crude shipments from the Gulf of Mexico
because of the weather.  Shell reduced operations at Deer Park, TX, by
an undisclosed amount for the same reason.
      MTBE prices have stalled in the past several weeks, due to light
trading interest and sufficient supplies, after performing strongly in
the first three weeks of December.  Spot Gulf Coast MTBE held at 92
c/gal last week, said sources, who added that they do not see any
events on the mid-term horizon that will affect prices.  Methanol
contracts rolled over unchanged from December to January at 42 c/gal,
with spot prices at discounts of as much as 10 c/gal from those
levels.
      Ethanol prices were also unchanged at spot levels, though some
Midwest marketers reported that rack rates increased by 1-2 c/gal in a
reflection of stronger rack gasoline prices.
      Crude price gains were attributed to expectations of continued
strong product demand.

CDTECH PIONEERS SAFER, SMARTER BENZENE UNIT FOR TEXACO

      CDTECH is licensing its first application of CDHydrosm for the
selective hydrogenation of benzene in reformate feedstocks for Texaco
Refining and Marketing Inc.'s Bakersfield, CA, plant to provide a less
expensive way for the refiner to meet its CARB Phase 2 RFG gasoline
requirements.
      The technology provides an economic way for Bakersfield to
produce a high-octane component, since it lacks a catalytic cracker. 
The plant has 16,000 b/d of low-pressure catalytic reforming capacity.
      CDHydro technology, said to be the first of its kind, is
designed to replace the standard fixed-bed hydrogenation and
conventional distillation units in one single proprietary catalytic
distillation unit.  The Texaco contract will mark the first commercial
use of a combined, single-step reaction and fractionation of benzene,
allowing cheaper, lower-pressure and safer operating conditions, said
Tom Hickey, director of marketing and operations, CDTECH.  
      While gasoline benzene specifications continue to be more
stringent worldwide, CDHydro hydrogenates benzene into cyclohexane,
considered to be more environmentally innocuous.  The new technology
operates isothermally, thus eliminating the concern of temperature-
rise common in fixed-bed reactor systems.  Another advantage is that
the technology utilizes commercially available catalyst.
      Also,  standard fixed-bed units require a larger volume of
hydrocarbons in processing because they use more equipment for
processing them.  CDHydro utilizes just one column already present in
the refinery eliminating the need for additional hydrocarbon
inventory.  "This reduces the ultimate residence time of the liquid
and limits hydrocarbon holdup," Hickey said.
      The technology has been commercially available since mid-1994,
and may be installed either as a retrofit or a new column.  Although
it may not be universally useful to all refiners, Hickey said, "we
expect to see a fair number of applications, but that really depends
on a case-by-case basis.  However, 100%" of everyone that has to build
a new reformate splitter can benefit. 
      "We will probably see wide utilization in Europe because of the
strict new environmental regulations on benzene," Hickey said.  "Many
refiners will require new reformate splitters to remove benzene, and
in those applications, CDHydro is a natural." 
      Texaco recently installed a new, 7,200-b/d reformate splitter
column at Bakersfield to produce California Phase 2 RFG, which will
utilize the CDHydro technology.  Currently, the 56,000-b/d refinery
does not produce any RFG, either Federal or California.  Texaco
declined to comment on the projected savings it expects to glean from
the CDHydro technology or the amount of RFG it plans to produce.  The
upgrade won't alter the plant's overall crude capacity, however. 
      Other options for eliminating benzene include pre-fractionation
for precursors, post-fractionation, removing the benzene for sale, and
alkylation.  CDTECH developed the technology based on its similar
applications for butadiene hydrogenation for C4 streams.

JANUARY 1996

TAKEOVER ATTEMPTS

Takeover mania continues unabated outside our borders. Internally, so
many companies and/or oil and gas divisions are being placed on the
market, hostile efforts are usually not necessary.
Of course there are exceptions. A group of dissident shareholders try
for the umpteenth time to unseat the Tesoro Petroleum board. The
group, which includes Kevin Flannery, James Stone, George
Baker, Alan Kaufman and Robert Washburn, own about 5.7% of the Tesoro
shares. Group files a 13-D with the SEC notifying it that the group
will mail a proposal to shareholders to elect its slate of five board
nominees, which include Gale Galloway and Douglas Thompson. Group
proposes to sell the Alaskan refinery and other assets, possibly
including all of Tesoro.  The takeover battle for First Interstate
Bancorp continues to rage on.  After Wells Fargo increased its offer
to .667 share for each First share, and First had rushed into the
arms of First Bank Systems (Minneapolis), Wells reported a plan to
purchase up to 5% of First's shares.
First Bank reported Wells couldn't do that under takeover laws. That
point is still up in the air.
Meanwhile, the market price of Wells shares keeps rising, making their
offer even higher, up to $1 billion more. Wells to ask First
shareholders to reject the First Bank offer and accept its offer. The
whole deal may still come down to whether the SEC allows First Bank to
use the pooling accounting treatment of its merger with First rather
than the purchase accounting treatment, which Wells has to use. As of
last word, the SEC accountants hadn't decided, but heavy-duty
analysts argue both sides of the proposal. Near press time, First
Interstate sues Wells in Delaware court, charging securities laws
violations.
Other bank mergers include Fleet Financial Group's $3 billion offer
for the U.S. commercial banking unit of Westminster Bank PLC. Deal
makes Fleet the eighth largest in the U.S. The Royal Bank of Scotland
will merge its U.S. unit, Citizens Finance Group, with First NH Bank,
the third largest in New England and a sub of Bank of Ireland, giving
Royal Bank of Scotland a 76.5% share in the combined bank.
## UPDATES FROM NORTH OF THE BORDER
The Murwell Resources Ltd. board recommends acceptance of the takeover
offer from Icon Energy Ltd. of two Icon shares for each Murwell common
as reported last month. Offer mailed early in December.
Other takeovers reported herein include the C$380 million 
Rigel offer for Inverness the merged company to have reserves of 572
BCFG and 58.9 MMBL; the C$1.1 billion offer by Alberta Energy for 
Conwest Exploration; and the C$186 million offer by Forest Oil for 
ATCOR Resources.
Another new takeover attempt that turns hostile is made by a
consortium of a Canadian energy company, a pension fund, a Canadian
bank and a U.S. investment firm. On Dec. 17, Pembina Acquisition
Corp., which is owned 51.5% by Pembina Resources Ltd., 30% by the 
Ontario Teacher's Pension Fund, 10.8% by Allen & Company Inc., and
7.7% by T D Capital Group Ltd., an affiliate of the Toronto-Dominion
Bank, reports its intention to offer C$7 per for the shares of 
Mark Resources Inc. Hints at a possible higher offer. The group
currently holds 2.88 million Mark shares, or about 5.2%. Deal subject
to review of financial data and 66.67% acceptance.  Asks Mark for a
list of its shareholders. Group retains T D Securities Inc. and RBC
Dominion Securities to act as financial advisors. Deal currently
valued at C$354 million.  By next day, Mark shares trade above the
offer price at C$7.125 per. On the 19th, Mark board calls the offer
too low and approves a shareholders rights antitakeover plan with a
20% trigger. Mark hires CIBC-Wood Gundy Securities as financial
advisor. Pembina reports disappointment with the board maneuvers,
plans to proceed with the offer. Analysts expect a higher offer, up to
the C$8 range. Mark acquired Hillcrest Resources in a hostile takeover
earlier in 1995 and was expected to be a target.
Pembina is privately owned by the Mannix family of Calgary.
Pacalta Resources Ltd. offers C$.55 per for shares of Trax Petroleum
Ltd. Trax board sets up committee to review offer and hires CIBC Wood
Gundy Inc. as financial advisor.  In the UK, Melrose Energy PLC
continues its takeover offer for Pentex Oil PLC. Melrose offers 81 new
shares for every 20 Pentex shares, or about $31.2 million, based on
current market prices. Deal would give Pentex shareholders a 29.5%
stake in Melrose. Melrose to also issue a rights offering to raise
capital for the group, offering one new share at 34 pence for each
five shares held. Pentex board approves the deal.  Basically Pentex
Oil management (Pentex has 67 employees) will take over management of
Melrose Energy. Pentex chairman, Henry Cameron, will become chief
executive and Pentex managing director will take the same job at
Melrose. Robert Adair, a geologist who owns 60% of Melrose, will see
his stake reduced to 40% and will take the deputy directorship and CFO
job.  Melrose has few employees, but manages oil and gas interests in
Texas, New Mexico and Wyoming.  Pentex produces 6,000 BOPD from its
interests in two North Sea fields and produces about 500 BOEPD from 12
onshore UK fields.
In other European news, Statoil extended its offer for 
Aran EnergyAran Energy after receiving only 83.78% of Aran shares by
Dec. 6 in response to its 76 Irish pence per offer. By the 13th,
Statoil had received 85.43% and declared its offer unconditional.
Talisman Energy Inc. (Calgary) makes a takeover offer for Goal
Petroleum PLC (London). Offers 97.5 pence in cash per share, or about
C$275 million, and agrees to assume about C$40 million of Goal debt.
Institutional investors holding 45.5% of Goal agree to tender their
shares to the offer. Goal has 20 employees with production of about
20,000 BOEPD from a 5% interest in the Wytch Farm, 32% in Blenheim,
2.5% in Mangus and interests in 47 other British and Dutch licenses
and fields. Proved and probable reserves estimated at 31.1 MMBO and
83.9 BCFG. Deal gives Talisman 49,000 BOEPD from the North Sea and
quadruples its exploration acreage there. Talisman to borrow the C$315
million from the Royal Bank of Canada.
Central and South West Corp. extends its offer for shares of 
Seaboard PLC to January 11 after receiving only about 44.42% of
Seeboard shares, or 109 million shares to its offer. Including shares
it held, that gives CSW about 74.31% of Seeboard.
Abbot PLC, parent of KCA Drilling (Aberdeen) makes a $8.25 million
takeover offer for OIS International Inspection (Aberdeen). OIS
services the oil, gas and petrochemical industries.
Kvaerner A/SKvaerner A/S makes a hostile takeover offer of 100 pence
per for Amec PLC, which is involved in the development of the Natuna
Field, offshore Indonesia.
In other areas Fletcher Challenge Ltd. ups its ownership of Southern

MERGERS AND JOINT VENTURES

## JOINT VENTURES
American Exploration Co. (Houston), Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp.
and Seisgen Resources LLC form an exploration JV for Wilcox prospects
in Lavaca Co., Texas Gulf Coast. American has leased or acquired
seismic options covering 20 Upper and Lower Wilcox prospects
identified with 2-D seismic data. The JV will begin a 137-square mile
proprietary 3-D seismic survey in early 1996 and plans a drilling
program after interpretation is completed.
American to hold a 52.5% WI in the JV; Louis Dreyfus, 35% and Seisgen,
12.5% (that's a lot of dough for seismic). American and Dreyfus are
already drilling Wilcox shots in nearby areas.
Petrobank Energy and Resources Ltd. (Calgary) acquires a seismic
option on the 16,350-acre McGill-Stewart Ranch in Kenedy County, South
Texas Gulf Coast. No wells have been drilled on the ranch since the
1970s. Petrobank will pay $50,000 in cash for the option and commit to
a seismic acquisition and reprocessing program estimated at $150,000.
By March 20, 1996, the company must exercise its option to take a
1-year, 74% NRI lease for $150,000 in cash and 400,000 of its shares
and commit to a 9,000-foot depth or greater well. Lease has a
six-month continuous drilling clause.
KCS Energy Inc. (Houston) joins a three-year exploration JV with 
Hawkins Oil of Michigan Inc. (Tulsa) and the former principals of 
Savoy Oil & Gas Inc., who retained the rights to explore on
150,000 gross acres (56,250 net) acquired from Shell in the heart of
the Niagaran Reef fairway in the northern part of Lower Michigan, and
the rights to 17,000 miles of Shell proprietary seismic data. Savoy
reports plans to redrill the State Kalkaska H 1-3 near Shell's
abandoned 1-3 well.
Frontier Natural GasFrontier Natural Gas Corp. (OKC) reports an
agreement with a "sizable" seismic vendor to reprocess and interpret
over 1,100 line miles of 2-D seismic data over the Breton and
Chandelier Sound areas of the Gulf of Mexico. Frontier is looking for
bright spots.
SK Resources and The Hillman Company form a JV, Broughton Associates,
to explore in the hot East Texas patch reef play. SK has reportedly
accumulated some 30,000 acres in the play. Acreage prices in the play
area are going through the roof; some talk of $1,500 per acre offers.
Delhi Gas Pipeline Corp. plans a 275 MMCFGPD expansion of its East
Texas pipeline system to accommodate the production from the above
play. Delhi will construct 85 miles of 20-inch pipe and
8,000 hp of compression and increase the capacity of its existing Aker
and Teague treating facilities.
Texaco reports it will spend $20 million for its share of the
355-square mile 3-D seismic exploration JV with LL&E Exploration in
the Terrebonne Bay area of South Louisiana. Expects results of the
survey by mid-1997.
United Petroleum (Knoxville, TN) sub, Jackson-United Petroleum Corp.,
forms a JV to farm out acreage from Penn Virginia Oil & Gas Corp., sub
of Penn Virginia Corp. Jackson-United to drill three wells on Penn
Virginia leases in Pike Co., KY.
Deal includes an option to extend the JV for three additional wells.
Penn Virginia keeps rights to purchase the gas produced from the
wells.
Equity Oil Co. reports the first three wells in the exploration JV
with Slawson Exploration Inc. based on the 41.5-square mile 3-D
seismic survey in the Orion area of the Sacramento Basin of northern
California were all successes. Two of the wells tested over 3
MMCFGPD. Twenty anomalies were defined by the survey.
The Flextrend Development Co. and Tatham Offshore Inc. JV on the
former Tatham Gulf properties found 100 feet of vertical pay at
4,800 feet in the Viosca Knoll 817 A-1 well. The high angle well is
producing 30 MMCFGPD.
3DX Technologies Inc. reports that the Yearwood No. 1 Frio test flowed
1.15 MMCFGPD with a FTP of 1,600 psi. The well is the fifth completion
in the 3-D seismic JV led by Cox & Perkins in the Texas Gulf Coast.
Cox & Perkins holds a 55% WI in the well while 3DX
holds a 17.5%.
Pittencrieff Resources reports disappointment with the results of
drilling in the Flour Bluff-Pita Island fields near Corpus Christi. In
August, the Newsletter reported that Pittencrief had put its North
American assets on the market. The Netherland, SewallNetherland,
Sewall & Associates engineering estimate cut proven reserves by over
50%, to 17 MMBOE. Chief Executive Officer Heneaghan blames the Corpus
properties for the majority of the drop. Pittencrieff sets up a 3-D
seismic study of the fields to try to better develop remaining
reserves and will halt drilling until the results of the survey are
studied. No comment from the other 50% partner, Fletcher Challenge,
which purchased its interest from Enron for $45 million late last
year.
Forest Oil Corp. reports that the West Cameron Block 615 wildcat found
333 net pay in the vertical hole and 472 TVT feet of pay in the
sidetrack. Forest holds 25% WI in the block, having sold
another 25% to Santa Fe Energy Resources after the block was acquired
in the 1995 lease sale. Forest has a 50% WI in two adjoining blocks:
West Cameron 616 and 617. Plans a 3-D survey on those tracts.
Alberta adopts a uniform province royalty on all oilsands projects.
All projects to pay a minimum royalty of 1%; after companies have
recovered all costs, including a return allowance equal to the
federal long-term bond rate, the royalty rises to 25% based on net
project revenues. The revision to be phased in over 10 years. Province
hopes the change will kickstart new projects.
The Hunt Oil Co. Inc. and PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd. JV, along with 
Mobil Oil Canada Ltd., cut a deal with the Canadian and Newfoundland
governments to combine the four exploration licenses they hold in
offshore and onshore Western Newfoundland and to extend their rights
through January, 2000 four years beyond the original term of two of
the licenses. The JV has drilled on one of its two licenses from an
onshore location in extreme southwestern Newfoundland and by all
reports has discovered major reserves. The JV then farmed-in the Mobil
blocks and currently is drilling a deviated hole from a land location
at the extreme northern tip of the Port au Port Peninsula. The JV has
already committed to drilling another well in 1996, probably offshore
from its first well using Rowan Company Inc.'s Gorilla IV jackup. The
group commits to at least four wells to get the consolidation.
The above has set off a frenzy of activity in the area, including
seismic and drilling plans.
Talisman Energy farms into the 178,000 hectare block owned by 
Vinland Petroleum Inc. and plans a directional well from an onshore
location in the near future. 
Oilexco Inc. reports cutting a deal with Vinland to hold a 25% WI in
that well. All that activity causes the Newfoundland government to put
up 1 million hectares of its western onshore acreage for bid. Acreage
to be divided into 31 parcels and bids due in March 1996.
Northwest Natural Gas Co. (Portland, OR), through its Canadian E&P
sub, Canor Energy Ltd., and NIPSCO Energy Inc.'s Canadian affiliate,
Southlake Energy Inc., form a JV to develop oil and gas properties in
Western Canada. Canor will manage the properties and both parents will
inject additional capital with the objective of combining their subs
into a new company by the end of 1997.
Circle Energy Inc. joins United Compass Resources Ltd. in a JV program
in SE Saskatchewan to earn a 50% WI in several thousand acres by
exploration and exploitation drilling.
According to the Rocky Mountain Oil Journal, TransTexas has changed
its mind about shooting a major 3-D survey on its 110,000 acres in the
Lodgepole trend that it acquired in a JV with Phoenix Energy Co. The
RMOJ reports TransTexas has hired First Union Corp. to find a buyer
for the block.
Shell Offshore, Amerada Hess and Pennzoil pool assets and plan
development of five Garden Banks block discoveries. Shell's Enchilada
sub-salt discovery in Block 128, along with its discoveries in Blocks
83, 84 and 127, and Amerada's discovery in Block 172 will be developed
together, with platforms in Block 128
and later in Block 172. Shell will operate the project, which is
expected to produce about 300 MMCFGPD and 40,000 BLPD when fully
developed.
Mike Baugh, president of BHP's Australia/Asia region, reports in an
article in the December Journal of Petroleum Technology that
government takes of discoveries vary widely in the region. Malaysia
and Vietnam have about 15% to 20% higher takes than the ZOCA area
between Australia and Indonesia, and 30% higher than Australia proper,
35% higher than the Gulf of Mexico and 60% higher than in
the U.K. He gives an example of net cash flow to companies from
production from a 160 MMB field in 300 feet of water is about $300
million in Australia, $200 million in Papua New Guinea,
$100 million in China, less than $80 million in Thailand, Indonesia
and the Philippines and about $50 million in Malaysia.

GAS PRICES

Well gas prices did some mighty strange things in December. The cold
weather in the Northeast caught everyone by surprise and pipeline
supply just wasn't enough to keep up with demand. The bottleneck at
the Henry hub appears to be the main culprit as producers in Texas and
the Rockies were unable to get enough gas through that interchange,
while Louisiana and SE state producers opened the taps wide.
Therefore, as pressure mounted for more gas to fight the cold, the
short players had to scramble to cover their positions. The capacity
restraint, the short positions and the perceived low storage levels
drove eastern U.S. and local city gate prices through the roof. Some
city gates hit $6 in the crunch. Meanwhile, the Midwest states,
although just as cold, were able to draw down their more-than-adequate
storage volumes instead of bidding in the market. Thus Chicago gates
didn't get much above $2, although that began to change at month-end,
rising to about $3.50.
The overall effect was to raise prices, but expect the effect to be
temporary. Everything depends on the weather, of course, after the
short-players get covered.
Delivered-to-pipeline spots started December in the $1.85 to $1.90
range in Oklahoma, about 25 cents to 30 cents higher than last month
and last December. By January 1, prices had moved up only slightly as
Oklahoma gas was squeezed out of the rush to the east. Prices rose to
the $2 level on an average.
Texas Gulf prices didn't fare much better. Prices started the month in
the $2.05 range, up 40 cents from last month and 45 cents to 50 cents
from last year. By January 1, prices at some points had actually
slipped to the $2 range as Texas gas also got squeezed out. Even as
the pinch got worse in early January, Texas Gulf prices only increased
about 10 cents.
However, Louisiana spots were a different game. At the start of
December, Louisiana spots were in the $2.20-$2.25 range, up 45 cents
to 50 cents from last month and 55 cents to 65 cents from last year.
By January 1, prices varied widely from the Koch Gateway in the $2.60
range to most other points paying $3.30 to $3.55. The Henry hub saw
$3.50 in early January.
West Texas prices mirrored the rest of the middle states. The Waha hub
saw early prices in the $1.75 to $1.80 range, up 25 cents from last
month and 15 cents from last year. By month-end, prices had edged up
to the $1.90 to $2.05 range.
Rockies prices couldn't even see the rally. The Opal hub started the
month in the $1.30 range, up 5 cents from November and down 30 cents
from last December. By month-end, prices had actually slipped about 5
cents. In the southern Rockies, prices weren't much better, hitting
$1.30 to $1.35.
California border prices went nowhere, ending the month in the $1.50
range.
Canadian border spots stayed in the $1.10 to $1.25 range in the West
and soared to the $2.85 to $3.50 range in the East.
Appalachian fared better naturally, rising to the $3.70 to $3.85 range
by month-end.
Futures prices were a different story. Early December quotes for
February delivery were in the $2 to $2.15 range. By late month, that
had soared to the $2.05 to $2.35 range and by early January, futures
on the NYMEX hit the $3 to $3.10 range for February deliveries.
Gas storage volumes, of course, began to plummet. On December 1, the
AGA estimated storage at 83% full with 2.66 TCFG, down 9% from last
Dec. 1, some 73 BCFG pulled out in the last week of November. By the
end of the third week of December, storage had dropped to 70% of
capacity, after 154 BCF was pulled the week before, down 15% from last
year. No later figures were in, but you can bet Northeast storage
volumes were hitting rock bottom.
The above classically illustrates the dangers of speculative trading
in gas futures. It also dramatically puts the finger on problem areas
the Henry hub and the still low volume of peaking gas storage
facilities in the Northeast. This is one time when the LDC buyers got
caught short trying to drive down gas prices.

EDITOR'S COMMENTARY

Interesting article in the December JPT called "Heterogeneity,
Geostatistics, Horizontal Wells and Blackjack Poker," by Dennis
Beliveau dealing specifically with horizontal wells, but more
particularly about predicting outcomes when dealing with wells and
reservoirs.
I see a study of average annual pay for various industry groups in
Houston listed oil and gas extraction workers at $35,848/year.
Security brokers led the list at $87,747 followed by electric, gas
and sanitary services at $42,052 (!). Transportation equipment workers
came in at $37,765 per.
Louisiana reports monthly state employment in oil and gas extraction
averaged about 48,100 workers over the first nine months of 1995, up
from 44,700 in 1994. Experts expect that to increase to about 50,000
in 1996.
The Oklahoma Geological Survey reports that half of the state's gas is
produced by 3,200 small operators from leases that produce less than 1
MMCFGPD.
Exxon to help pay for an equipment upgrade on Sonat Offshore's
Discoverer Seven Seas and has contracted the drillship for deep water
wells worldwide over the next two years.
The deepwater royalty relief in the recently signed bill ending
Alaskan crude export restrictions is a nice boon to Gulf producers.
All new leases in waters of 200 meters or better qualify. No royalty
due on first 17.5 MMBOE in depths of 200 to 400 meters, on the first
52.5 MMBOE between 400 and 800 meters and on the first 87.5 MMB deeper
than 800 meters.
And, where do these utilities get these new names? Yikes!

to end at 55 cents.
   NYMEX natural gas for February delivery lost two cents to finish
at $1.32 per 1,000 cu. ft. of gas.
   Traders attributed the weakness in the energy market to
unusually higher temperatures in the northeast and mid-west of the
country.
   They said the weakness was led by the home heating oil and
natural gas markets.
   On the United States Gulf Coast spot market on Jan. 13, WTI was
20 cents down at $17.50 a barrel, while on the New York Harbor spot
market, unleaded gasoline improved by 0.08 cent to 51.50 cents.

ENERGY:  IRAN-PARTICIPATED GAS PIPELINE PROJECT MAKES PROGRESS

   NEW YORK, Jan. 16 (OPECNA) -- The pipeline project to export gas
from Turkmenistan to Europe via Iran and Turkey has made progress,
according to China's news agency Xinhua.
   It said a meeting held to discuss the project would be chaired
by Turkmen President Saparmurad Niyazov and attended by the oil and
energy ministers of Turkmenistan, Turkey, Iran, the Russian
Federation and Kazakhstan.
   It is reported that representatives at the meeting will discuss
whether to join a company to build the 845 km pipeline, estimated
to cost $2 billion.
   As there are some problems in the gas transportation through the
Russian pipeline to Europe, Turkmenistan initiated a project to lay
a pipeline as an alternative export route for it to sell its gas
to Europe.
   It is estimated that Turkmenistan has gas reserves of 21
trillion cu. meters, the third largest in the world. But its gas
exports to Western Europe have fallen from 11 billion cu. meters
in 1992 to almost zero now.
   Turkey and Turkmenistan signed a natural gas transportation
accord in May 1992 and Ankara is interested in the project as it
is greatly in need of gas to meet domestic consumption.
   It is believed the financing of the ambitious project will be
finalized at talks in the Turkish capital, starting today.
   The Itar news agency confirmed that the meeting was also
expected to fix the date to begin construction of the pipeline.
   Turkmen President Saparmurad Niyazov will meet Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel to discuss mutual seller-buyer guarantees.
   "A managerial body capable of mastering substantial financial
and technical resources to implement the pipeline project will be
set up," according to Khekim Ishanov, the Turkmen minister for oil
and gas.
   "The Turkmen transcontinental pipeline will be able to transport
from 15 billion to 28 billion cu. meters of gas a year. Its
construction is expected to begin next may after the package of
financing documents is signed," he added.

ENERGY:  CONOCO EXECUTIVES VISIT VENEZUELA

   CARACAS, Jan. 16 (OPECNA) -- High-ranking executives from Conoco
of the United States have made a two-day visit to Venezuela to
analyze progress in a joint-venture association with Maraven, a
Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) affiliate.
   The delegation met with Maraven president Emilio Abouhamad and
other board members to monitor progress in the association for the
development, production, transportation and upgrading of
extra-heavy crudes from the Orinoco oil belt.
   The Maraven-Conoco strategic association is aimed at producing
some 120,000 b/d of nine degrees api extra-heavy crude, which will
be transported along a 210 km pipeline to installations at Jose,
Anzoategui state for upgrading.
   These installations include a delayed choking plant, designed
to produce some 113,000 b/d of upgraded 20 degrees api crude that
will be shipped to Conoco refineries in the U.S.
   The delegation included Conoco's executive vice president of
corporate strategy, Robert E. Mckee, vice president for business
development and exploration and production resources Michael
Stinson, vice president of business development and optimization
Donald Unruh and the association project manager, David Griffith.
   The group also met with Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA)
president Luis Giusti and PDVSA vice president Claus Graf.

ENERGY:  OCCIDENTAL INKS BANGLADESH PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACTS

   NEW YORK, Jan. 16 (OPECNA) -- Occidental petroleum has announced
that it has signed production-sharing contracts with Petrobangla,
the state oil company of Bangladesh, to explore a 3.4 million acre
area in the gas-producing region of northeastern Bangladesh and to
appraise a large gas discovery made in 1989 by another operator.
   During the initial exploration period, Occidental will conduct
a 1,250 km seismic program, beginning this year, and will drill
two exploratory wells.
   The contracts are the first to be signed under the country's new
petroleum laws, which recently were changed significantly.
   The exploration area is composed of blocks 12, 13 and 14, which
are served by a pipeline system with sufficient capacity for new
discoveries.
   More than 25 trillion cu. ft of natural gas has been discovered
in 17 fields in Bangladesh, which has a growing need for the fuel.
   Currently, gas production is around 600 million cu. ft per day.
Occidental is operator with 100 percent of the contractor's
interest.

ENERGY:  WORLD BANK APPROVES $150 MILLION LOAN TO ALGERIA

   ALGIERS, Jan. 16 (OPECNA) -- The World Bank has approved a $150
million loan to Algeria, the Algerian News Agency (APS) has
reported quoting a World Bank statement.
   The loan would offer support to financial reforms and social aid
programs in Algeria, the statement said.
   Algeria was currently facing economic stagnation, a population
growth rate of 2.5 percent per year, a fall in its per capita
income of 25 percent, and an unemployment rate close to 25 percent,
the statement added.
   To counteract these problems, the government had undertaken a
stabilization program aimed at stimulating and transforming the
economy with support from the International Monetary Fund, it
noted.
   Inflation was currently under control and the budget deficit was
scheduled to be reduced from nine percent to three percent of gross
domestic product in 1995.
   The World Bank loan is repayable in 17 years, including a
five-year grace period, under usual World Bank conditions.
   Additionally, the African Development Bank has granted an 83.57
million loan to the Algerian firm Sonelgaz (electricity and gas).
   The loan will finance electricity projects, notably connecting
some 350,000 new users.
   Since 1971, the African Development Bank has financed 22
Algerian projects worth $1.4 billion.

ENERGY:  OIL PRICES SUFFER LOSSES IN ASIA, MIXED IN LONDON

   SINGAPORE, Jan. 16 (OPECNA) -- Fuel oil prices on the Singapore
International Monetary Exchange (Simex) closed on a slightly softer
note today, unflattered by the firmer tones adopted by domestic
bunkering trade.
   Traders here said the market was mostly cautious with the
front-month February fuel oil contract being discussed between a
low of 95.60 dollars a ton and a high of 96.40 dollars.
   Fuel oil futures trade was mostly under the influence of weak
crude and mixed prices on the International Petroleum Exchange
(IPE) in London today.
   The Simex February fuel oil contract settled the day at 96.20
dollars for a loss of 10 cents, while the March position fell by
50 cents to 94.50 dollars.
   Trading volume was a mere 165 lots, based on initially computed
figures.
   In bunkering trade, cst 180 was still maintaining a higher mood
at 103 dollars a ton, while cst 380 was in the 93 dollar range.
   Meanwhile, in early trading on the IPE, Britain's north sea
brent crude for March delivery was fetching 16.14 dollars a barrel,
up by one cent from Friday's close.
   However, gasoil on the exchange for February was being quoted
1.25 dollars lower at 140.75 dollars a ton.

DROPPING ETHANOL INVENTORIES SIGNAL TIGHT SUPPLY, SAYS MARKETER

      Fuel ethanol stocks across the U.S. have been dropping since
September, and marketers believe that the decrease in inventories is
an indication of supply tightness throughout the system.  Ethanol
stocks at the end of November were about 2.1 million barrels,
according to the latest Energy Information Administration (EIA)
report.  This is only a  slight decrease from last year's level of 2.3
million barrels, but a substantial drop from the 4.2 million barrels
EIA reported in September 1995.
      MTBE stocks have also dropped in the last few months, but the
decrease is not as dramatic as that seen in ethanol.
      While EIA does not show a dramatic decline in ethanol production
since September, marketers say ethanol is beginning to show the signs
of a tight supply market.
      "A lot of the tightness has to do with the amount of supply that
has been removed from the market," said one ethanol marketer.  Four
ethanol plants have been closed due to poor production margins earlier
in the year and others have cut back fuel ethanol production, he said. 
"Right now we are in the middle of a heavy demand period, with the
oxygenated fuel seasons, and we are faced with a contraction of supply
but demand is still at about normal levels -- leaving a definite
tightness in the market."
      Ethanol prices continued to respond to the tightness last week,
with prices increasing 1-2 c/gal.  Gulf Coast spot ethanol traded at
$1.18/gal and export was in a range of $1.18-$1.22/gal.
      However, the current price support is expected to be short-
lived.  "We have about 30-40 days of strength left in this market,"
noted the marketer.  "The demand will begin to fall off in mid-
February, and prices should fall as well."
      After a strong showing in December, MTBE prices seemed to have
stabilized, according to traders.  Gulf Coast spot MTBE remained in a
range of 92-93 c/gal.
      Methanol prices also remained steady last week, though there was
some speculation in the market that contract list prices may increase
later in the month.

INDUSTRY GEARS UP FOR INTRODUCTION OF CARB PHASE 2 RFG
-State Tests Show No Problems in Vehicles or Off-Road Equipment-

      With less than two months until the production of CARB Phase 2
RFG is required in California, refiners, oxygenate producers and state
government officials are reporting no problems with the implementation
of the program.   Supplies of CARB RFG and the oxygenates required to
produce it are expected to be sufficient to meet demand.
      The start of the California Phase 2 RFG program will be the last
big regulatory boost for oxygenates, according to Jim Thomas, vice
president of market analysis for Bonner and Moore Associates, Inc. 
"After CARB Phase 2 begins, oxygenate demand will only grow with the
normal growth rate of gasoline -- which is usually not very large," he
said.
      MTBE will be the oxygenate of choice for most refiners producing
CARB Phase 2 RFG, predicted Thomas, though some ethanol, TAME and even
ETBE will be used to meet the increased demand for oxygenates.
      Demand for MTBE will gain an additional 40,000 b/d for the last
six months of 1996, when CARB Phase 2 RFG is required at the retail
level, said Thomas.  "If you look at the average annualized demand
increase in 1996, it is about 20,000-25,000 b/d," he said.
      Oxygenate supply should be sufficient to meet the new demand,
and non-U.S. suppliers will be aggressively seeking their share of the
new business, Thomas said.  "There is a lot of volume available that
can be moved around," he said.  "There are new plants coming online in
Korea that will help, and product is available from Brazil, Saudi
Arabia and Europe."
      Oxygenate pricing should strengthen due to the greater demand
structure and remain strong until the market adjusts to the new
demand, Thomas said.  However, large price spikes, like those
preceding the start of the federal RFG program, are unlikely since
MTBE contract pricing is now more closely tied to market factors, he
said, adding that such spikes are very difficult to predict.
      Many refiners are already beginning to stockpile MTBE for use in
CARB RFG, said Thomas.  "Some of the current strengthening in MTBE
prices is a reflection of that inventory building," he said.

State Tests Show No Vehicle or Equipment Problems

      CARB's test program, done in conjunction with some of the
state's key refiners, gave Phase 2 RFG a clean bill of health, said
CARB officials recently.  The tests involved 829 vehicles in eight
private and government fleets that drove about five million miles on
Phase 2 RFG from February through August 1995.
      "There was no meaningful difference between the frequency of
fuel-system problems in vehicles using cleaner-burning gasoline and
the pre-1996 (conventional) gasoline," CARB Chairman John Dunlap
announced.  "Cleaner-burning gasoline has been thoroughly tested and
has broad-based support within industry."
      The few problems noted were on vehicles with mileage above the
average of the fleet (95,000 miles) or vehicles that used an
especially low-aromatics fuel Texaco developed but does not intend to
sell commercially.  Separate, smaller tests on various off-road
construction vehicles, lawnmowers and farm equipment found no
performance problems, Dunlap added
      Mileage for the Phase 2 vehicles was about 1% less than Federal
RFG now sold in Southern California and 3% below conventional gasoline
sold in the state, CARB found.

SOUTH AMERICA RANKS IMPORTANT IN GLOBAL METHANOL MARKET
-Region Will Be 30% of World Trade in 1998-

      While demand growth for methanol in South America is not
expected to be great through the end of the century, growth in the
region's production capacity is projected to be one of the largest in
the world, according to experts.  "The South American region is one of
those strategic offshore locations on which increasing emphasis must
be placed if any realistic prognosis of the future direction of the
[methanol] industry is to be made," said Rampersad Motilal, divisional
manager of manufacture and marketing for the Trinidad and Tobago
Methanol Co. (TTMC).
      South America's share of world methanol export trade continues
to grow, making it even more critical to the global methanol industry. 
"At present, the South American net share of world trade is close to
2.5 million metric tons, which represents approximately 20% of the
world total," Motilal told attendees of CMAI's World Methanol
Conference in Phoenix.  "By 1998, South America will account for close
to 4.4 million metric tons of world trade -- over 30% of the world
total."
      With a capacity growth rate of more that 18% from 1989 through
1995, South America led other regions of the world in production
increases, Motilal said.  From 1995 through 1998, the region's
production capacity is expected to grow another 16.5%, he said.
      The five largest methanol-producing countries in South America
are almost all expected to see continued growth in production capacity
through the end of the century.  At the same time, demand for methanol
is not expected to keep pace, leaving more product available for
export.
      Chile and Trinidad & Tobago will be doubling or nearly doubling
their production capacity between 1995 and 1998, according to Motilal. 
Methanex is constructing a second methanol plant in Chile.  The
926,000-metric-tons-per-year plant is expected to be online late in
1996.  Trinidad & Tobago is expecting the addition of three new
production facilities -- making it the largest methanol producing
country in the region with 2.1 million metric tons per year of
capacity.  Methanex, TTMC and Saturn Methanol are all planing to build
facilities in the island nation.
      Brazil and Venezuela lead the region in methanol demand.  Most
of Brazil's demand comes from its national fuel alcohol program, while
MTBE production dominates Venezuelan demand.

Region Offers Producers Several Advantages

      Low feedstock costs are one of the advantages of methanol
production in many South American countries, said project developers. 
However, it is not the only advantage the region holds.  For example,
Trinidad & Tobago "not only offers competitive natural gas prices, but
also skilled labor, logistical advantages and duty-free access to both
Europe and U.S. markets and has the needed infrastructure available,"
said Deo van Wijk, president of Saturn Methanol Co.  Saturn announced
plans for the construction of a 2,500-metric-tons-per-day (287-
million-gallons-per-year) facility to be located in Point Lisas,
Trinidad & Tobago.  The plant is expected to be on-line by late 1997

SOUTH DAKOTA ETHANOL SUPPORTERS CONSIDER YEAR-ROUND OXYGEN

      Ethanol proponents in South Dakota are considering their options
to add a year-round oxygen requirement to the state's gasoline.  While
an exact course of action has not yet been devised, a bill may be
introduced as early as this session.
      "A year-round oxygen content has a lot of merit," said Trevor
Guthmiller, executive director of the American Coalition for Ethanol
(ACE).  "The question is, can we educate legislators on the issue in
time to pass it this year?  The lawmakers we have discussed the idea
with so far do seem positive."
      The South Dakota Corn Growers Association (SDCGA) have also
shown support for such a move, said Jane Heenen, program coordinator
for SDCGA.  The group passed a resolution to support legislation "that
would require the sale of gasoline that contains at least 2.7%
oxygenates such as ethanol" and "encourage South Dakota's governor and
legislators to take the lead in getting all PADD II states to have
similar oxygenated fuel standards."
      However, both ACE and SDCGA were quick to note that a year-round
oxygen requirement should not come at a cost of the state's other
incentives for ethanol.  "We don't want to lose the incentives we
already have in place," said Heenen, noting that almost 50% of the
state's gasoline already contains ethanol.  "This may not be the year
to proceed."
      Minnesota begins its state-wide oxygen requirement in 1997, and
Nebraska is also considering such a move.

API PETITIONS EPA TO REPEAL NOx REDUCTIONS IN PHASE II RFG

      In the first attempt to amend Federal Phase II RFG
specifications, the American Petroleum Institute (API) has filed a
petition with U.S. EPA seeking  a repeal of the agency's requirement
to reduce summertime NOx emissions.  "This move is an attempt to
formalize the complaint we have had with the NOx reduction regulations
since the rule was promulgated," said API spokesman Chris Kelley. 
      Oxygenate producers worry this move may be the first in a series
of attempts to change Phase 2 specifications, including one to remove
the oxygenate requirement.
      In the petition, API argues that NOx reduction is not a cost-
effective way to control summertime ozone and in some cases may
actually exacerbate the problem.  EPA estimates NOx reduction costs at
about $5,000/ton while API maintains that the cost is closer to
$10,000/ton. 
       "API remains convinced that EPA's estimates of gasoline
desulfurization costs and the cost-effectiveness of NOx reductions are
far too low because of flawed refinery modeling assumptions," the
petition states.  "Because consumers would be faced with the higher
costs of Phase II RFG, API's petition urges EPA to repeal the NOx
reduction requirements, which would require refiners to make
significant capital investments.
      Phase I of the federal RFG program calls for no increase in NOx
emissions from gasoline, while Phase II RFG, which takes effect in
2000, calls for a 5% to 7% reduction in NOx emissions.
      Since the 1994 promulgation of the RFG rule, EPA has granted
several state waivers from certain stationary source NOx reduction
requirements, API noted.  The foundation of these waivers stems from
the "undisputed fact that NOx reductions in many areas do not help and
may even hinder some areas in their progress toward complying with
federal ozone pollution standards," the petition said.  
      Like VOCs, NOx emissions are widely believed to be a precursor
to ozone.  However, some studies have shown that in a few cases, NOx
may actually serve to break down ozone and that NOx reductions could
work to increase urban ozone concentrations, depending on the VOC- to-
NOx ratio.  Across-the-board RFG NOx reductions are not warranted,
"especially when other, more cost-effective and more targetable
controls are available," API wrote.
      API called for a prompt rulemaking on its request to repeal the
NOx reduction requirement, asking EPA to suspend the requirement until
"a more comprehensive assessment of the NOx control strategies and an
evaluation of EPA's overall nitrogen oxides control strategy can be
performed."
      With EPA closed temporarily, there has been no recent movement
on the issue, noted a source at the National Petroleum Refiners
Association (NPRA).  "There was a meeting but it was nothing more than
a formality," said the source.  "We had discussions with EPA that the
cost and the effectiveness of a NOx control strategy has not been
properly analyzed."
      While no studies on this issue have been performed recently,
"work was done earlier in conjunction with the RFG regulations and
other work on sulfur issues," said the NPRA source.

Oxygenate Sources Call the Change A "Mistake"

      "We are concerned about any of these changes to RFG
specifications," said Douglas Durante, executive director, Clean Fuels
Development Coalition.  "To suspend NOx reduction or any other
requirement without indisputable data and a consensus of stakeholders
would be a mistake," he said.
      While agreeing that fuel science is constantly evolving, Durante
showed concern over proposed changes to RFG specifications every time
new data appears.  "There needs to be a better process for dealing
with changing data," he said.
      "At this time API is not looking for any other changes in the
Phase II RFG regulations," said Kelley.

GOVERNORS' ETHANOL COALITION SUPPORTS RFG IN ATTAINMENT AREAS

      Even as the U.S. EPA is on the verge of finalizing its rule on
RFG opt-outs, the Governors' Ethanol Coalition (GEC) is adding its
support to the growing list of those urging the agency to allow ozone
attainment areas to join the federal program.
      "Allowing ozone attainment areas to participate in the RFG
program at the request of a state governor will provide states with
another strategy with which to combat air pollution and achieve Clean
Air Act goals," wrote Govs. Ben Nelson (D-NE), Tommy Thompson (R-WI)
and Mel Carnahan (D-MO) in a Dec. 15 letter to EPA Administrator Carol
Browner.
      Allowing attainment areas to opt-in to the program is
appropriate for several reasons, according the governors:

* RFG has made a measurable contribution to air pollution control, is   
highly cost-effective and safe;
* Participation in the program may help areas in attainment avoid   
slipping into nonattainment;
* RFG would assist downwind areas to reach attainment through reduced
pollution transport; and
* Once in nonattainment, control measures required in an area would
limit industrial expansions and consumer freedom.
      "While the Clean Air Act establishes a number of mandatory
control strategies, the Act still demonstrates a clear commitment to
allowing states the flexibility to determine the appropriate mix of
measures needed to meet air quality goals," wrote the governors. 
"Voluntary participation by attainment areas in the reformulated
gasoline program is just such a measure."

THIRD QUARTER MTBE, METHANOL PRODUCTION OUTPACED 1994 RATES

      Production of both methanol and MTBE in the third quarter
outpaced the same period in 1995, says the International Trade
Commission's (ITC) Preliminary Report on U.S. Production of Selected
Synthetic Organic Chemicals.
      MTBE far outpaced increases of other key octane boosters,
growing 273,884 metric tons, or 9.46%, from third quarter 1994 rates
to 3.169 million metric tons.
      During the same period, methanol production also inched up,
rising 60,955 metric tons, or 1.69%, to 3.667 million metric tons.
      Benzene, which is limited to 1.0 vol% in RFG, fell 95.066
million liters, or 17.84% from the same time last year to 5.738
billion liters in the third quarter.  However, production of the two
other major aromatics used in gasoline blending -- toluene and
xylene -- made year-to-year gains on the strength of petrochemical
demand.  Toluene production advanced 1.21%, or 21.014 million liters,
while xylene production rose 9.23%, or 313.383 million liters.

E-95 SHOWS "SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS" IN TAILPIPE EMISSIONS, SAYS STUDY

      While E-95 surpasses premium gasoline in reducing carbon
monoxide, hydrocarbon and oxygen emissions, carbon dioxide emissions
are slightly increased, reveals a newly released study from Mankato
State University (MSU) in Minnesota.  
      The study compared the fuel efficiency, tailpipe emissions, fuel
economy, horsepower and drivability of E-95 (a blend of 95% ethanol
and 5% unleaded gasoline) to that of conventional premium unleaded
gasoline in a 2.5-liter, four-cylinder General Motors engine.
      Test results show significant reductions in tailpipe emissions,
as well as increases in fuel efficiency and horsepower with E-95 fuel,
researchers said.  However, the test vehicle's fuel economy decreased
with E-95 due to the lower energy density of ethanol.
      The study, which primarily involved laboratory testing for
horsepower and emissions, also included some road testing,
particularly for fuel economy.  It ran from January 1994 through June
1995, according to Fred Kuzel, director of the Great Lakes Regional
Biomass Energy Program, which supplied funding for the study.
Additional funding was received from MSU and the Minnesota Corn
Processors Association. 
      The vehicle used in the study was one of several test vehicles
designed and built by senior automotive engineering students at MSU. 
The fuel and ignition systems of a Recycled Automotive Design vehicle,
developed by MSU students in 1991, were modified to run on the
alternative fuels.
      For information about the study, call Associate Professor Bruce
Jones, MSU College of Science, Engineering and Technology, at (507)

PITTSBURGH COMES CLEAN BY JOINING DOE PROGRAM

      Pittsburgh has become the latest addition to the U.S. Department
of Energy's Clean Cities program, marking the second designation for
Pennsylvania.  Philadelphia earned designation in 1993.  Pittsburgh's
addition brings the program's year-end total to 43 Clean Cities
nationwide.
      Pittsburgh has more than 650 compressed natural gas (CNG)
vehicles fueling at 23 public stations in the area.  The stakeholders
involved in planning Pittsburgh's Clean Cities program expect to add
another 1,650 alternative fuel vehicles -- mostly CNG, with some
electric -- by the year 2000.  They also plan to add 40 fueling
stations.
      The program will get local support from the University of
Pittsburgh, with its Natural Gas Vehicle Technology Assistance
Program, to research the operation of NGVs.  The $1.13 million program
is being funded through Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality
Improvement grants, Pennsylvania's Alternative Fuels Incentive Grant
Program, and Equitable Gas.

AGENCY EXPLORING WAYS TO CONTINUE FEDERAL FLEET PROGRAM

      While Congress struggles to pass a 1996 fiscal year budget,
others are looking for ways to ensure the federal government continues
adding alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) to its fleet despite budget
cutbacks.  
      Since the Energy Policy Act (EPACT) established federal fleet
AFV requirements in 1992, much of the incremental costs have been paid
for by the U.S. Department of Energy.  This year Congress nixed DOE's
$20 million request for 1996 after rescinding funds in 1995.
      Without DOE funding, many doubt that federal agencies will
purchase AFVs in substantial numbers.  So DOE proposed an executive
order requiring that agencies meet EPACT's AFV mandate by paying for
it themselves.  The requirement stipulates that AFVs comprise 25% of
1996 federal fleet purchases, an estimated 12,500 vehicles.  The
proposed executive order has been supported by the natural gas and
electric vehicle industries, which have expressed concerned that EPACT
rule delays and Congressional funding rescissions are sending the
message that AFV program support is waning.
      The proposed executive order, which is expected to be reviewed
by the White House as early as next week, would also require that each
alternative fuel comprise at least 10% of the federal fleet's annual
AFV purchases, depending on commercial availability of fuels and
vehicles.
      So agencies with aggressive AFV programs would not be penalized,
the proposed executive order would direct the General Services
Administration to average the incremental costs across the entire
federal fleet.

ASSOCIATION CHARTS EV RECHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE

      There are 888 non-residential electric vehicle charging outlets
across the United States, according to a survey released by the
Electric Vehicle Association of the Americas (EVAA).  Of those, only
43 of the 219 charging locations are at public stations.  Most (72%)
are located in California, with Georgia having the second highest
concentration.
      Conductive charging sites account for about 90% of those
available.  Conductive charging utilizes a standard plug outlet with
metal-to-metal contact and will be used by Ford and Chrysler electric
vehicles.  General Motors announced it will produce its vehicles to be
charged inductively, which transfers power through a magnetic
connection with no direct contact.
      "This is an emerging transportation technology, and we are now
seeing only the very first commercial stages of vehicles and
chargers," said EVAA's executive director Robert Hayden.  The
association plans to release a site directory and will continue to
annually track infrastructure development.
      The EV industry is working to make greater inroads in charging
infrastructure.  The Electric Transportation Coalition's "EV Market
Launch" begins this year with workshops in 10 cities selected to
become "EV-Ready":  Los Angeles; Sacramento; Atlanta; Washington,
D.C.; Phoenix; New York City; Richmond; Boston; Detroit; and Ft.
Lauderdale.  The program will focus efforts in those areas to address
issues such as local, state and federal building codes, safety
training, fleet acquisition and charging availability.  The
coalition's goal is to place 5,000 new EVs on the road by 1997.

ENVIRONMENT CANADA TO EXPAND ECOLOGOtm PROGRAM FOR OXYGENATES

      Environment Canada is reviewing the possible expansion of its
automotive fuels category beyond just ethanol to consider granting a
variety of oxygenates and alternative fuels EcoLogotm status, which
would likely boost their sales.
      The government is considering opening the status to more than
just ethanol, for possible inclusion of MTBE, ETBE, TAME, propane,
methane, natural gas and low-sulfur diesel.  The group will consider
all types of automotive fuels, including those intended for use in
modified spark-ignition engines, such as compressed natural gas and
propane, as well as modified compression ignition engines.  Additional
categories may be added later.
      The EcoLogo status, part of Canada's Environmental Choice
Programtm, signifies the government's endorsement of the fuel as
environmentally responsible.  The EcoLogo appears on wholesale and
retail packages, and the government provides incentives to fleet
owners who use the recognized fuel.  Ethanol is the first and only
fuel granted EcoLogo status, but a routinely scheduled review is now
also underway to determine if it will retain its status.  The program
is revised every three years.
      "It's pretty safe to assume that ethanol will remain in the
program," said Kevin Gallagher, Marketing and Customer Relations for
TerraChoice Environmental Services, Inc., administrators of the
Environmental Choice Program.  "In fact, it's just beginning to take
off in Canada."  One company he cited has enjoyed 20% sales increases
in the last year and a half, since it was granted the status. 
      Preliminary testing conducted on ethanol reveals it comes close
to meeting the tentative draft standards.  A final determination is
expected by June 1996.  Ethanol blends of 5% or higher qualify for the
EcoLogo label at this time.  Canadians use 35 billion liters of
gasoline annually.
      To earn the status, Environment Canada will review currently
available life cycle information to determine if the fuel reduces
toxic emissions, global-warming substances and tropospheric ozone or
smog.  The fuels will be compared with an established matrix, and
scored for each of its stages against pollutant standards.  However,
the fuels won't be compared with each other, Gallagher explained.

MAJORS TURN TO JOINT VENTURES, ALLIANCES TO FINANCE OVERSEAS
DEVELOPMENT

      Major oil companies are emphasizing joint ventures and alliances
as they move to develop overseas projects. Leading U.S. producers have
worked with foreign entities since oil first was discovered outside
the United States. But the new agreements include financing by non-
U.S. participants that effectively makes them fuller partners as the
world oil industry continues to evolve.
   The most recent agreements include a $210 million investment by
Korea Petroleum Development Corp. (PEDCO) in exchange for a 15% stake
in Texaco Inc.'s Captain field in the British North Sea, and a multi-
faceted alliance between Chevron Corp. and Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.
subsidiary Maraven S.A. to develop the Boscan field in Venezuela and
supply heavy crude to Chevron in the United States.
   Chevron's arrangement makes it the first publicly traded multi-
national oil firm since 1975 to be responsible for such a high level
of Venezuelan production. It expects to spend $2 billion over a 20-to-
30-year period in the heavy oil field. The San Francisco-based company
will be responsible for Boscan operations and production (which it
plans to increase from 80,000 barrels per day to 150,000 b/d over the
next three years), while Maraven will handle marketing.
   The alliance, which covers an initial 20-year term with a 10-year
extension option, will make Maraven Chevron's joint venture partner in
a West Coast asphalt business, the Chevron Ven Asphalt Alliance.
"Boscan crude, with an API gravity of 10 degrees, is an excellent
asphalt feedstock," notes Dave O'Reilly, president of subsidiary
Chevron USA Products Co. Maraven also will supply crude to Chevron's
refinery at Pascagoula, Miss., and its asphalt plants at Perth Amboy,
N.J.; Portland, Ore., and Richmond Beach, Wash.
   Texaco, which previously owned 100% of the Captain field, will
continue to be its operator. It expects 60,000 b/d of initial
production, beginning in 1996's fourth quarter. Since a portion of the
project's expenditures will be lease-financed, PEDCO will assume a 15%
obligation for the financing. The companies expect to complete their
transaction during 1996's first quarter.
   "In addition to acquiring an investment partner with this alliance,
Texaco gains an important business relationship with PEDCO -- one that
will provide access to market opportunities in the Far East and in
other potential project developments," maintains York LeCorgne,
managing director of exploration and production at affiliate Texaco
U.K. Ltd. "The formation of strategic alliances is an important
element in Texaco's plan for growth and allows the company to expand
its core oil and gas activities worldwide."

BROCK'S MERGER INTO KEY MAY BE FIRST OF MANY AMONG SMALL INDEPENDENTS

   By Wall Street's standards, Key Production Co. Inc.'s approximately
$13 million all-stock acquisition of Brock Exploration Corp. is
relatively minor. But it could signal a consolidation among smaller
publicly traded independent producers every bit as intense as the
sales of domestic production properties and formation of joint
ventures by major oil companies, a leading oil analyst contends.
   "It could take place across the board. People who had good years in
1992 and 1993 following 10 years of the natural gas `bubble' are
beginning to say, `Never again!' after several warm winters," says
Joseph Culp of A.G. Edwards and Sons Inc. in St. Louis. "Just as the
majors are amalgamating their domestic assets, the smaller producers
are doing the same thing, only with stock because they don't have as
much financial leverage." Key Production and Brock will structure
their merger as a tax-free exchange, with Brock shareholders receiving
one Key common share for every 1.45 Brock share. Key also intends to
open a regional office in New Orleans that will be staffed by several
employees who previously worked for Brock.
   Brock Exploration's sale has been expected since the New Orleans
independent producer issued its 1994 annual report with a front cover
featuring Lawrence E. Brock, the chairman and founder, posing with his
wife, Lorena, who was corporate secretary, standing on a Gulf of
Mexico beach alongside the words, "We toiled for 28 years! We left our
tracks! It's time to go! Adios, Amigos!" Brock is in his early 80s.
His wife is about 10 years younger.
   What took some observers by surprise was Denver-based Key
Production's role of purchaser. "It obviously brings it onto the Gulf
Coast. But it's a big move for Key beyond its Rocky Mountain and
California bases that I frankly didn't expect because I haven't
followed the company that closely," says one analyst who asked not to
be named.
   Culp, who does track Key, says that the deal makes perfect sense.
"It apparently is a combination of someone who probably said, `My
better days in the oil business are behind me,' with someone else who
said, `I'll let you ride a little bit on my coattails, but I also want
to diversify my assets,'" he tells Petroleum Finance Week. "Key has
been a financially sound company all along that's been able to acquire
properties and then aggressively exploit them. Apparently, it was able
to strike an all-stock deal based on its record of being able to do
something positive with its assets. It's going to be able to pay for
this because its recent acquisitions in California are beginning to
bear fruit."
   Key Chairman Francis H. "Mick" Merelli and Brock say that they
believe the combined companies will be more efficient and stronger
than either one was by itself. The merger has to be approved by both
companies' shareholders, who will vote on the proposal at special
meetings in February. Key intends to file the necessary registration
covering the new shares it intends to issue with the Securities and
Exchange Commission as soon as possible. The companies expect the
combination to be complete this spring.
   Culp considers Key a relative sleeper among small independents and
Merelli "a well-respected guy who walks in the circles of the large
independents. He can get an audience and do deals that surprise some
people. But he has always been very good at being conservative and not
taking big drilling risks. He also has made some good strategic
acquisitions. The company tends to hide its light under a bushel,
preferring to let its actions speak louder than its words. If people
understood the kind of value it offered, it would have a much higher
share price."

NORAM ENERGY COMPLETES TWO BANK CREDIT FACILITIES TOTALING $550
MILLION

   NorAm Energy Corp. completed two bank credit facilities totaling
$550 million with a group of 22 banks. The facilities are a $150
million term loan and an amended $400 million revolving credit, which
will allow NorAm to release two pipeline subsidiaries that it
previously provided the banks as security and provide the integrated
natural gas company financing at a lower price and with reduced
borrowing fees. CitiBank was agent for both facilities. Bank of
Montreal and NationsBank of Texas were lead managers of the revolving
credit, the terms of which were extended to December 1998.
   The $150 million term loan is a five-year facility, which will
generate proceeds for NorAm to redeem $150 million of 8% notes due
January 1997, which it called at par on Nov. 22, 1995, and redeemed on
Dec. 22. This facility, as well as the revolving credit, includes a
pricing grid where the facility and borrowing codes are reduced once
debt rating services Standard and Poor's Corp. and Moody's Investors
Service upgrade specific assessments.
   "These two facilities were well received by the banking community,
with both being well over-subscribed," notes NorAm Chief Financial
Officer Michael B. Bracy. "The improved terms in the revolving credit
reflect NorAm Energy's continuing improvement in credit quality,
reflected by debt reduction and improved results from operations. The
release of the security previously provided by [pipeline subsidiaries
NorAm Gas Transmission Co. and Mississippi River Transportation Corp.]
to the banks is another step toward management's goal of returning
NorAm Energy to an investment grade."

AMOCO, UNOCAL EMPHASIZE OVERSEAS PROJECTS IN 1996 E&P SPENDING PLANS

      -- Pennzoil's '96 Outlays Will Slightly Exceed 1995 Level --
   Continuing a well-established trend among major U.S. oil companies,
Amoco Corp. and Unocal Corp. each emphasized overseas exploration and
production prospects as they announced capital spending plans for
1996.
   Chicago-based Amoco announced a capital spending and exploration
budget of $4.7 billion, a 12% increase from the $4.2 billion approved
for 1995. The rise follows an increase last year of 31% from 1994's
$3.2 billion, "a pattern of strong re-investment" that compares with
average annual spending of $3.4 billion during the 1990-94 period.
   "The continued growth in our spending is a clear indication of the
success of our 1994 restructuring," Amoco Chairman H. Laurance Fuller
says. "That restructuring has allowed us to reduce costs, accelerate
decision-making and empower our business groups to more quickly bring
forward projects that we believe will provide profitable growth. In
fact, additional funds above the $4.7 billion level could be made
available to take advantage of other opportunities. For example, we
currently are negotiating the purchase of Albemarle Corp.'s olefins
derivatives business, the cost of which is not included in this
budget."
   Of the $2.8 billion that Amoco has budgeted for 1996 exploration
and production outlays (about 60% of the total), overseas projects
account for $1.4 billion, up from $1.15 billion of the nearly $2.68
billion E&P total in 1995. Significant projects include construction
of a liquefied natural gas plant in Trinidad and a program of highly
focused exploratory drilling. Startup of crude oil and natural gas
production in China and gas production in China and continuation of
Egyptian and North Sea programs also are included. U.S. E&P spending
will fall to an even $1 billion from nearly $1.08 billion in 1995,
while outlays in Canada will decline by $50 million, year-to-year, to
$400 million in 1996.
   The company expects to spend $525 million for refining and
marketing improvements ($450 million in the United States and $75
million overseas), principally to upgrade gasoline marketing
operations. In 1995, it spent $600 million downstream ($575 million in
the United States and $25 million overseas).
   Amoco has budgeted $1.25 billion in chemical outlays for 1996, $875
million of which is planned for the United States and $375 million
slated for overseas, where new facilities or expansions are under way
in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Belgium. In 1995, its chemical
spending totaled $900 million, with $575 million spent in the United
States and $325 million spent overseas.

With Downstream Outlays Essentially Complete, Unocal Turns its
Attention Upstream...

   Unocal budgeted $920 million, or 68% of its forecast $1.25 billion
capital spending total, for exploration and production, a 10.8%
increase from the $830 million it spent on E&P in 1995. The 1996 total
is slightly below the estimated $1.4 billion that Unocal spent overall
last year. "We have significantly reduce the capital allocated to our
downstream segment now that we've completed the refinery modifications
to manufacture California-mandated reformulated gasoline," Unocal
Chairman Roger C. Beach says. "This frees capital for new projects in
Southeast Asia, particularly Myanmar, Thailand and Indonesia, as well
as the oil project in Azerbaijan that will create significant value
for the company."
   Approximately $530 million of the $920 million budgeted for E&P is
earmarked for overseas oil and gas activities, up 43% from an
estimated $370 million in foreign upstream outlays during 1995.
Domestic E&P spending is budgeted at $390 million this year, down from
$460 million in 1995. Some 64% of the U.S. upstream budget is slated
for development of key natural gas projects in Louisiana and the Gulf
of Mexico.
   Unocal earmarked another $240 million for worldwide exploration,
$170 million, or 71%, of which will be spent for projects near
existing operations that the company believes have a high potential
for success.
   Planned expenditures for Unocal's 76 Products Co. division, which
encompasses its West Coast refining and marketing holdings, are $230
million for 1996, a 41% drop from 1995's $390 million. About $100
million is designated for marketing, principally the addition of quick
service restaurants, convenience stores, car washes and other new
profit centers to existing retail sites. Another $90 million is
planned for Unocal's California refineries on projects to enhance
profitability and meet environmental regulations.
   Spending for geothermal and power projects are expected to nearly
double to $110 million in 1996 and focus on projects in Indonesia.
Diversified businesses (agricultural products, carbon and minerals
operations, pipelines and real estate development) will receive $50
million, a 29% drop from 1995's $70 million when Unocal started up an
ammonia and urea manufacturing plant in Finley, Wash.
   Another integrated U.S. oil firm, Pennzoil Co., announced a 1996
capital budget totaling $474 million, up from the approximately $472
million that it expects to spend in 1995. The Houston company will
spend $233 million on oil and gas exploration, $214 million on motor
oil and refined products operations and $27 million on franchises and
other operations. The company also announced that it has hedged a
substantial portion of its 1996 oil and gas production as part of a
risk management program that it established in 1994.

TENNECO, QUESTAR CANCEL KERN RIVER DEAL AFTER UNFAVORABLE FTC RULING

   Citing the potential concentration of market power for Questar
Pipeline Co. in the Salt Lake City area, the Federal Trade Commission
voted against allowing Tenneco Energy Co., a subsidiary of Tenneco
Inc., to sell its 50% interest in the Kern River natural gas
transmission system to the pipeline division of Salt Lake-based
Questar Corp.. The companies agreed last week not to legally challenge
the ruling and terminated the $225 million cash deal that was
announced Sept. 8.
   The transaction would have been the largest in Questar's history,
dwarfing its $94.5 million purchase in April 1994 of exploration and
production assets formerly held by Amax Oil and Gas Co. from Union
Pacific Resources Co.. "We really wanted this deal. But the FTC
apparently doesn't understand how the restructured natural gas
industry works and how difficult it has become for a pipeline to
dominate a market," a Questar spokesman tells Petroleum Finance Week.
"It has sent a signal that we intend to aggressively grow and will
pursue other opportunities. But the growth won't be with Kern River."
   The 904-mile pipeline runs from Opal, in southwestern Wyoming, to
Bakersfield, Calif. It delivers 700 million cubic feet of gas per day
to customers that include local distribution companies, direct end-
users, electricity cogenerators and enhanced oil recovery systems.
Tulsa-based Williams Companies Inc. owns the remaining half interest
in Kern River.
   "We are disappointed with the Federal Trade Commission's ruling and
don't agree with it," says Tenneco Energy Chairman Steve Chesebro'.
"However, during the bidding process, we received a high level of
interest from several qualified bidders. We plan to reopen contact
with these parties in the next few days, with the goal of competing
the sale in a timely manner."

PARKER DRILLING WILL BECOME FIRST U.S. LAND DRILLER IN VIETNAM

   A subsidiary of Parker Drilling Co. will become the first Western
drilling contractor to work onshore in Vietnam, officials disclosed at
the Tulsa company's annual meeting. Parker Drilling International Ltd.
will drill two wells south of Hanoi for Australian oil company Anzoil
N.L. near the Gulf of Tonkin coast. Further contract terms were not
disclosed. "Parker has a long tradition in pioneering new drilling
markets. Vietnam holds great potential and we plan to establish a
long-term presence in this energy-rich country," said Parker Drilling
President Robert L. Parker Jr. In 1980, the company became the first
U.S. onshore drilling contractor to gain a contract in the People's
Republic of China. It became the first Western drilling contractor to
work in the former Soviet Union in 1991 and the first to enter
Kazakhstan in 1992.

LYONDELL PETROCHEMICAL ADOPTS POISON PILL THAT PARTIALLY EXCLUDES ARCO

   Lyondell Petrochemical Co. adopted a 10-year shareholder rights
plan, effective Dec. 20, 1995, that its directors say is designed to
protect shareholders in the event of a proposed change of control at
the Houston petrochemical producer and petroleum refiner. Like other
so-called "poison pills," the plan would be implemented with
distribution of common stock purchase rights as a dividend if a person
or group acquires 15% or more of Lyondell's outstanding common shares,
or if a tender or exchange offer is commenced that would have that
effect. The plan provides an exception for Atlantic Richfield Co.,
which currently holds 49.9% of Lyondell's stock. But it could be
activated if Arco decided to accumulate additional shares.

WHO'S WORRIED ABOUT DEREGULATED ELECTRIC UTILITY COMPETITION? NOT
ATMOS

   The prevailing sentiment is that natural gas demand will suffer
initially because the electric industry, once it is decontrolled, will
be so much more competitive. "For a low-cost, efficient provider like
Atmos Energy Corp., competition brings more opportunity than concern,"
declared Robert F. Stephens, president and chief operating officer of
the Dallas-based, multi-state natural gas utility holding company.
   "We're old hands at competition in the industrial market,
particularly in our Kentucky service area, where 59% of our throughput
is to large-volume customers," he said during a recent Atmos
presentation to the New York Society of Security Analysts. "We're also
accustomed to competition at the retail level from other energy
sources, and compete for customers against some very low-cost electric
utilities."
   The company has stayed ahead of other natural gas distributors in
making sure its operations are streamlined and efficient. Stephens
said that it has 400 customers per employee, compared to an industry
average of 380. Its operating expenses are among the industry's
lowest. And its plant investment per meter is below the industry's
average.
   Atmos also reduced its already low average cost of gas per thousand
cubic feet during fiscal 1995 (ending Sept. 30) to $2.46 because its
market-sensitive contracts let customers benefit from lower wellhead
prices while keeping the company competitive. "By operating
efficiently to keep its gas price low, looking for ways to trim gas
costs and providing a valuable resource to its customers to reduce
their total energy bills, Atmos has achieved a record of success in
competitive markets," said Stephens.
   James F. Purser, Atmos' executive vice president and chief
financial officer, pointed out that the company achieved a 12.3%
return on average shareholder equity during fiscal 1995 from earnings
that rose 28.6% (despite weather in its utilities' Texas, Colorado,
Kansas, Missouri, Louisiana and Kentucky service areas that was 10.3%
warmer than normal) to $18.9 million, or $1.22 per share from fiscal
1994's $14.7 million, or 97 cents per share.
   Cash flow per share increased 40% in fiscal 1995 to $3.02 from
fiscal 1994's $2.46, with the help of rate increases totaling $2.8
million during fiscal 1995. Atmos has established an ambitious
building program for fiscal 1996, including a second Colorado gas
processing plant and gathering system upgrades in Colorado and Kansas.
But the company is holding to a debt-to-equity ratio target between
40% and 60%, Purser indicated. "Regulators, obviously, have an impact
on that, although it has not been a bone of contention in any of our
rate cases where we have explained our capital structure," he said.
   Atmos' wide-spread gas utility operations make it distinctive among
local distribution companies -- and frequently mentioned as a
purchaser when it comes to acquisitions. "Looking at acquisitions is a
regular ongoing activity for our company," Stephens confirmed. "We
have enough experience that, generally, if someone is considering
selling a piece of property, we're generally invited to look at it."
   Most government regulators are hesitant to allow recovery from a
utility's acquisitions that are above book rate. Atmos supports this
idea, but adds that there are occasional instances where an
acquisition above book value should be allowed because it would be in
the public interest. "The kind of regulation that's present and the
kind of economy that a prospective addition operates in determines how
much we're willing to pay," said Stephens. "But our interest is piqued
if something different is offered."
   Atmos does not set a limit on the size of a deal because that would
limit its opportunities. "There are lenders who will finance $200
million if a deal offers very favorable returns," said Stephens. He
conceded that earnings dilution is almost inevitable following
acquisitions. But he also emphasized that Atmos' purchases have not
diluted payouts to shareholders permanently, "and we plan to make
certain that it won't happen."
   He said that Atmos is aware that several primarily electric
utilities are thinking of divesting their gas holdings. "We're finding
that an equal number, if not more, tend to view their service role as
energy products and are quite happy to have gas as a part of their
companies. I do expect several to shift more of their operations into
separate components, and that could provide more opportunity for a
company like ours," said Stephens.
   Asked if Atmos might consider acquiring electric assets, he
promptly replied, "We certainly would. We realize the reality of the
situation with electric companies' balance sheets and their higher
investment per customer. That would make an acquisition very difficult
financially for any gas company. But we would be interested if we
found a deal that makes financial sense."

DUFF AND PHELPS, FITCH TAKE POSITIVE VIEWS TOWARD ENRON FOR DIFFERENT
REASONS

   Duff and Phelps Credit Rating Co. and Fitch Investors Service took
a positive view toward Enron Corp. in separate ratings actions. Fitch
sees an improving credit trend for the Houston integrated natural gas
company because it is structuring its businesses to compete on a
vertically-integrated basis worldwide in all of its operating
segments. DCR applauds Enron's sale of more than 25% of Enron Oil and
Gas Co. because Enron will use the approximately $690 million of
proceeds to reduce its short-term debt. But the ratings service also
cites uncertainty regarding the final outcome of the Dabhol power
project in India and resolution of a dispute over the J-block natural
gas contract. The Enron Oil and Gas stock sale involved two separate
transactions: the direct sale of more than 31 million shares and the
sale of 10 million 6.5% interchangeable notes, which DCR and Fitch
rate Triple B-Plus, with mandatory common share conversion provisions.
DCR also affirmed its Triple B-Plus ratings of Enron's senior notes, a
Triple B assessment its senior subordinated debt and a Triple B-Minus
rating of its convertible preferred.
   Moody's Investors Service and Standard and Poor's Corp. affirmed
their assessments of Talisman Energy Inc.'s senior debt following
Talisman's announcement that it will acquire Goal Petroleum Plc. (LSE)
for C$315 million in a debt-financed transaction. S&P, which assesses
Talisman's debt Triple B-Plus, sees a stable outlook for the company
because the purchase is consistent with Talisman's operating strategy
and will reduce its dependence on North American natural gas markets.
But Moody's, which rates the issue "Baa1", changed its outlook for the
Calgary independent oil and gas producer's credit to negative from
stable. Goal is a British independent producer active in the British
North Sea, and its acquisition is consistent with Talisman's goal to
increase its reserves outside Canada. Proved reserves, which total
approximately 45 million barrels of oil equivalent, are primarily
crude oil and include a 32% interest in the Blenheim field. Moody's is
concerned over the deal's size, the fact that it is being financed
with debt and the continuing impact of low gas prices.
   Moody's affirmed its "b1" rating of Tejas Gas Corp.'s preferred
stock while Standard and Poor's Corp. raised its assessment of the
Houston gas gathering, transmission and marketing company's issue to
Double B-Minus. Moody's also assigned a "Ba1" rating to the $455
million revolving credit facility of the Tejas Acadian Holding unit,
citing the parent company's relatively stable results, sensitivity of
earnings to gas prices and resulting pressures on margins from intense
competition in Gulf Coast markets. Both ratings services favorably
view opportunities from Coral Energy Resources, a gas marketing joint
venture in which Tejas has a one-third interest and Shell Oil Co.
holds a two-thirds stake. Coral, which began to operate in November,
is expected to assure higher volumes for Tejas' transmission system
and to expand its marketing capabilities.
   S&P placed a Single B-Minus rating on KCS Energy's $150 million of
senior unsecured notes, with a Single B corporate rating and a
positive credit outlook. S&P considers KCS "a small independent
exploration and production company with an aggressive financial
profile and above-average finding costs." Its positive outlook assumes
a favorable outcome for a gas contract dispute and moderate Rocky
Mountain drilling successes leading to improvements in finding and
development costs that are higher than average.
   In its first assessment of Public Service Co. of North Carolina,
Moody's assigned a preliminary "A2" rating to the Gastonia, N.C.,
natural gas utility's $125 million shelf registration for senior
unsecured debt. The assessment reflects PSNC's strong and relatively
stable earnings and cash flow, management's commitment to maintain a
conservative balance sheet and the absence of non-gas-related
subsidiaries. The rating also considers the company's small size
relative to other publicly traded gas utilities, its relatively high
average dividend payout ratio and the short-term nature of its
committed bank facilities.

IRAN STILL CONSIDERING ITS OPTIONS ON SHAKH DENIZ ROLE

(London)
Iran is still considering participating in Azerbaijan's Shakh Deniz oil and
gas project in the Caspian Sea, a senior Iranian oil official said last
week.
Mehdi Hosseini, the National Iranian Oil Co's exploration director, said in
a telephone interview from Tehran that Iran was still considering
Azerbaijan's invitation to join the project through an equity transfer from
state oil company Socar.
   Hosseini said the National Iranian Oil Co was "still looking at the
viability" of the project and that further exchanges of information with
Socar would be necessary. He said Socar had not imposed a deadline for
Iran's response to the long-standing invitation.
   Azerbaijan is anxious to compensate Iran for having been rejected as a
member of the consortium developing the offshore Azeri, Chirag and Guneshli
fields. Cash-strapped Socar plans to sell off part of its 40% stake in
Shakh Deniz, assigned in a preliminary agreement last summer with BP,
Statoil and Turkish TPAO which have a collective 60% equity. Negotiations
on a production- sharing agreement got underway late this year and will
resume in January 1996.
   Current thinking among the companies involved in Shakh Deniz is that
Iran could join the project, which currently has no US partners. But while
NIOC appears to be interested in Shakh Deniz, Iran's foreign ministry is
unwilling to endorse Iranian participation in an Azerbaijani offshore
project while the legal status of the Caspian remains unresolved, according
to analysts.
   Shakh Deniz's oil reserves are pegged at 1.2-1.4-bil bbl.
   Meanwhile, Hosseini said, French oil major Total will shortly begin
shooting seismic in the Sirri area offshore Iran. Hosseini said Total
already has begun a seabed survey using a vessel leased from NIOC. "Total
has started a seabed survey with this ship and will soon start seismic," he
said. "Drilling will be the next step," he added.
   Total in July signed a $600-mil contract to develop Iran's Sirri A and E
fields after Conoco of the US, which originally was awarded the contract,
was ordered by the US government to pull out of the deal.
   Total will be paid for its work with production from the project.
Hosseini said Total was working "in accordance with the time schedule."

UNOCAL SEEKS TO ADJUST THAI HOLDINGS
Wants to shift some stake to its partners

By:
Maya Webber

(Bangkok)
Unocal Thailand has asked its partners in several Gulf of Thailand contract
areas to increase their equity holdings, in a move to streamline gas price
negotiations by standardizing equity distribution in Unocal gas sales
contract areas I, II and III.
   Mitsui Oil Exploration Co currently controls 20% in Unocal I, 30% in
Unocal II, and 23.75% in Unocal III. If agreed to, the arrangement would
give Petroleum Authority of Thailand Exploration & Production Co a
first-time interest in Unocal I and II. PTTEP currently has a 5% interest
in Unocal II, but no interest in the other two contract areas.
   A Unocal spokesman in Thailand. said the negotiations do not reflect a
pullback by Unocal, which would remain the majority owner and operator of
the contract areas.
   "We were probing for a way to facilitate decision-making and cost
allocation among the three partners," said Konthi Kulachol, Unocal
Thailand's public relations manager, arguing that cost allocations can be
time-consuming and tedious.
   An increased interest by PTTEP could be attractive to Unocal in the
future. PTT, the monopoly operator of Thailand's natural gas pipelines,
retains a 70% interest in PTTEP.
   It makes sense to have "a close working relationship" with PTTEP, the
Unocal spokesman said.
   PTTEP officials said they have made no decisions about whether to invest
in Unocal I and II.
   Tevin Vongvanich, PTTEP vice-president for corporate planning and new
ventures, said that seeking to harmonize the equity holdings to reduce cost
allocation headaches is a good concept.
   Because the production potential of the areas is well proven, the
investment would involve little risk, he said. But that also means there
is limited added potential, he said. PTT's Natural Gas Business president
Prajya Phinyawat added that price would be a big factor in the decision to
take increased equity shares.
   Some of the fields are "quite old" and might start to decline, he said.
   Unocal Thailand's production from its offshore fields averaged 705,000
Mcf/d for the first nine months of 1995. Production is expected rise to
900,000-950,000 Mcf/d when a second pipeline to Rayong comes into service
next year. The company's investment in natural gas development in the gulf
represents the company's largest commitment for a single project. In
addition to Unocal I,II, and III, the company is also developing block
B12/27, the Pailin field.

AMOCO CANADA WILL SELL REMAINING CRESTAR STAKE

(Calgary)
Amoco Canada Petroleum Co. Ltd said it intends to sell its remaining 15%
stake in Crestar Energy Inc to fulfill a pledge to the federal government
following its C$5.2-bil takeover of Dome Petroleum Ltd in 1988.
   Calgary-based Amoco Canada said it has appointed RBC Dominion Securities
Inc as its agent to oversee block trades in Crestar.
   The planned transaction is valued at about C$134-mil ($98.4-mil) based
on Crestar's closing price Dec 28 of C$19.12 ($14.04) a share on the
Toronto Stock Exchange.
   Amoco Canada had promised to make certain assets available to Canadian
investors in the wake of its Dome acquisition. In 1993, the federal
government's screening agency for foreign investment allowed Amoco Canada
to spin off those assets to create Crestar.
   No date has been set to begin selling the 7-mil Crestar shares owned by
Amoco Canada, but the sale could start as early as Jan 4 under TSE
policies.
   Industry analysts have speculated that any proceeds from the Crestar
sale could be used by Amoco Canada to launch a significant takeover in
1996. Three months ago, Calgary-based Anderson Exploration Ltd's share
swap valued at C$800-mil beat out Amoco Canada's C$757-mil cash bid for
Home Oil Co Ltd
   Crestar is considered a promising player in Canada's oil patch. It
acquired Ranchmen's Resources Ltd. in a C$177.5-mil (C$130.4- mil) hostile
takeover effective Oct. 1.

NEB BACKING TCPL DEAL

(Calgary)
The National Energy Board has endorsed a historic four-year deal on
domestic and export natural gas transportation tolls negotiated by
TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. and Canada's natural gas industry.
   The new tolls are designed to save millions of dollars a year in
transportation costs (ON 12/22).
   The incentive regulation agreement between the gas line operator and
shippers has been lauded as a watershed for new ways to cut the massive
costs of delivering most of Canada's gas to domestic and US markets.
   Normally, tolls are decided by the NEB, rather than between suppliers
and pipeline operators, said NEB secretary Scott Richardson. Final
endorsement of interim tolls that reflect the pipeline's terms of service
will be considered at a January hearing, Richardson said.
   Under the agreement--the first in North America signed with a pipeline
operator--when TransCanada saves C$1 in costs, the benefit will be split
50-50 between the Calgary-based pipeline and shippers.

VIETNAM TO CUT ITS TARIFFS

(Hanoi)
The country will cut the import tariff for petrol from 70% to 55% beginning
Jan 1, following a request from the the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations that all tariffs be brought under 60%, an official at the tax
department at the Ministry of Trade said. Vietnam imports all its products.
Tariffs on diesel will remain at 25% and for jet fuel at 10%, the official
said. The country is cutting tariffs on 857 goods or commodities from the
six members of ASEAN, the first step toward membership in the ASEAN Free
Trade Area, which Vietnam will join fully in 1996.

MARCUS HOOK SHUTDOWN DELAYED, AS THREE-WAY LABOR TALKS CONTINUING

(New York)
BP has pushed back into January the possible shutdown of the Marcus Hook,
Pennsylvania refinery, allowing more time for the union there to reach a
new contract with Tosco, which is buying BP's US Northeast refining and
marketing assets.
   BP had said it would begin to suspend operations at the 190,000 b/d
Marcus Hook plant at the start of January if it was unable to close the
deal with Tosco by the end of 1995. And BP had wanted Tosco to have a new
contract in place with the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers union at the
refinery before closing its deal with Tosco.
   BP now has delayed the potential shutdown until the middle of January, a
company spokesman said Dec 29. However, a union official said BP has
indicated in talks with OCAW that it would push back the suspension until
the end of the month. The BP spokeswoman had not comment on the union
official's statement. BP's current contract with the OCAW expires Jan 31.
   BP has extended the shutdown deadline to allow more time for the
company, as well as Tosco, to negotiate with the OCAW, the BP spokeswoman
said. BP still must settle severance issues with the union, while Tosco
must negotiate a new contract. The spokeswoman said severe winter weather
in the Philadelphia area has delayed negotiations. She also said BP is
encouraged by the meetings that began last week between Tosco and the OCAW.
A bargaining session was held Dec 29 between OCAW and Tosco, which wants to
cut refinery staff by 25% and runs by 20%. The BP spokeswoman said BP
still wants to close the Tosco sale as soon as possible. Should the company
suspend operations in January, it's likely that the sale to Tosco would
close in February, she said.

ELECTRICITY, TAXES TO BE STATES' '96 FOCUS
Power restructuring will be felt in the field

By:
William Mullins

(Houston)
The continuing shift in electricity markets in the US looms as a major
issue that oil industry officials will be watching at the state level in
1996, according to a survey of oil and gas officials in several key
states.
   An overview of some of the leading state issues facing the industry this
year indicates that on the state level, the oil industry as electricity
consumer, rather than as provider of a generating fuel, has risen to the
top of the list of concerns in several states.
   Ironically, the second-biggest state in terms of oil production--
Texas--will not have a legislative session this year, so no issues will be
decided there.
   What follows is a state-by-state survey of some of the leading issues
that will be taken up by legislatures this year.
CALIFORNIA: The ongoing restructuring of electricity markets in the state
is an important issue to oil producers because they have a constant base
load demand and use a lot of electricity, said California Independent
Petroleum Assn president Dan Kramer.
   "So, as a group we'll be fighting potentially having to pay excessive
stranded costs, basically paying for utilities' bad investments in nuclear
power and some other more expensive forms of power that would be embedded
in our electricity rates," Kramer said. "We'll be fighting that issue along
with trying to lower electricity rates for our producers in general."
   Electricity bills in California, depending on where a company is
located, are 25% to 50% higher than in any other state, he said.
   Oil companies have formed a group called Oil Producers Electric Project,
and are working on a legislative solution to the problem.
   As for other issues in the nation's largest state, California doesn't
have a severance tax on oil production, and some of the more liberal
legislators probably will introduce a severance tax bill on the grounds
that other large producing states have such a tax, Kramer said. But oil
producers will be opposing it, Kramer said, basing its opposition in part
on the argument that California already has the highest property taxes on
oil production of any state that imposes such levies.
   The industry also will try again to reform the California endangered
species act, which is more stringent than the federal law, he said. A bill
almost was passed at the end of the last session but it failed because of
disagreements on a few issues, Kramer said.
   Still another industry goal is to repeal a portion of state fish and
game laws that allow the California Dept of Fish & Game, in conjunction
with local district attorneys, city attorneys and environmental groups, to
levy bounty hunter fines on producers with accidental spills, he said.
These are small accidental spills that can be less than one barrel, but
carry fines of up to $25,000 per day. Kramer said they have been levied on
a producer, even if it cleans up the spill.
   "We'll also attempt to coordinate oil spill response," he said. "In
California, when you have an oil spill, depending on where you're at, you
can have up to 15 or 16 different agencies involved in the spill and
they're all trying to assert their jurisdictional authority."
LOUISIANA: The legislature will be holding a session on fiscal matters
only, but the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil & Gas Assn thinks one issue that
could come up is the idea of an oil and gas processing tax designed to
raise revenue on the foreign oil imported into Louisiana, as well as the
offshore oil and gas coming into the state. Such a proposal has been
defeated previously and probably would be again, an association spokesman
noted.
OKLAHOMA: Oklahoma oil producers, like those in California, are hoping to
see the legislature enact some kind of electricity rate reform, said Mickey
Thompson, executive vice president of the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum
Assn.
   Oklahoma producers also will be fighting against two proposals that
would modify forced pooling arrangements, and allow higher damages to be
assessed in pollution cases, Thompson said.
   The forced pooling issue arises from a law allowing the state to step in
where there are multiple land owners on a tract, and an operator can't
reach negotiated settlements with all of them. The state can "force pool"
the properties in such circumstances.
   Royalty owners and producers are on opposite sides, with royalty owners
maintaining some operators are abusing the process by using it as a quick
way of putting together a tract without bothering to negotiate, according
to Jim Stafford, executive director of the National Assn of Royalty Owners.
"The poolings in Oklahoma in the last few years have gotten ridiculous in
terms of being vastly unfair in regards to fair market value, on lease
bonuses particularly," he said.
   Another factor is that royalty owners are concerned about a producer
acquiring multiple zones on a lease tract, but not drilling, testing and
producing all of them, Thompson said. This can occur when the producer
can't or doesn't want to produce from more than one zone and may later
produce the others, but some royalty owners would like to see a time frame
within which a producer had to produce the zones or lose his rights.
   Producers and royalty owners are having difficulty coming to an
agreement over the issue, Thompson said. So the situation may develop as it
did last year, when the royalty owners found a sponsor for their bill, but
couldn't prevail in voting on the measure.
   Another proposal supported by royalty owners and farm and ranch
organizations would change the Oklahoma law on how much damages courts can
award in pollution cases, Thompson said. The proposal follows a state
Supreme Court decision in 1994 that held a land owner could recover no more
than the total value of the land in a pollution case, although the Oklahoma
Corporation Commission still would be able to compel an operator to clean
up the pollution.
   The initial bill to negate the effect of the Supreme Court ruling
failed, but the oil industry expects a similar bill will be introduced in
next year's session, he said.
   Another issue which probably can't be handled in one session but which
the industry wants to pursue is the creation of a state oil and gas
department that would take over regulation from the Oklahoma Corporation
Commission, Thompson said.
KANSAS: A major tax shift bill that passed the House last year is in the
Senate tax committee now, said Donald Schnacke, executive vice president of
the Kansas Independent Oil & Gas Assn. The bill would shift about $600-mil
in annual school levies from overall property taxes to the sales and
individual income tax base.
   "We pay a significant property tax on oil leases, about $100-mil a
year," Schnacke said. "This bill, if it passed, would reduce our ad valorem
tax by about 50%. That would be a very significant improvement on our tax
situation. The governor is resisting this bill, but it's a very popular
bill and he may wind up having to veto it."
   There also is likely to be action on the issue of abandoned wells,
Schnacke said. The Kansas Corporation Commission has estimated there may be
as many as 91,000 such wells throughout the state, but they date from 1880
and regulation only started in 1935. "We're probably talking about using
dedicated severance tax money or something like that to help on the expense
of this well plugging," Schnake said.
COLORADO: The state's severance tax is likely to come up in the 1996
session of the Colorado legislature, according to the Rocky Mountain Oil &
Gas Assn. At present, 50% of the tax is allocated for local governments to
use in addressing impacts from mineral development, and the other 50% goes
into a state trust account.
   But an amendment is expected to be offered that would allow half the
state trust funds to be used for state agency projects directly related to
mineral development.
   Another proposal that the Colorado legislature is expected to consider
is a bill on retail wheeling, which would allow retail customers to freely
choose among different suppliers of electricity. The oil industry's
interest is both as a user of electricity and as a supplier of natural gas
to fire power plants.
NEW MEXICO: In a budget-only session, there might be a revival of a
proposal to impose a pipeline tax that would raise $10- or $15-mil for the
state, said D. Van De Graaff, executive vice president of the New Mexico
Oil & Gas Assn. The proposal previously passed the Senate, but was defeated
in the lower chamber.
OTHER STATES: The Idaho legislature will consider raising the state's motor
fuels tax 2-5 cts/gal to pay for road maintenance and construction, while
South Dakota will be looking at an increase of 3cts/gal dedicated to county
roads and bridges.
   Utah's legislature also is being urged by government agencies to
increase the state motor fuel tax to fund road work.

PETRODOLLARS

By:
Peter Zipf

Who would have thought that old war horses like Exxon, Mobil, Texaco and
the like could still put on such a strong finishing kick? The group of the
largest publicly traded oil majors ended 1995 with an impressive
performance in equity markets. In the last two months of 1995, a group of
14 large oil companies posted a stock- price gain of 11%, bettering the 5%
increase in the Standard & Poor's 500. Most of the majors clearly needed
this late run to the wire, since for much of the year they badly lagged the
stellar 34% gain posted by the S&P 500 for the full year. Even with the
late jump, the 14-member oil group's full-year gain was 24%.
   The oil group did have its stars for the full year, with Exxon (up 37%),
Mobil (+35%) and the smaller Kerr-McGee (+35%) managing to beat by a nose
the gain of the S&P 500. Also in this top-tier group, though trailing the
broader market by a length, were Royal Dutch/Shell (+30%), Texaco (+30%)
and BP (+29%). Further back in the pack in 1995 were Shell Transport &
Trading (+24%), Amoco (+22%), Chevron (+18%), Amerada Hess (+18%) and
Marathon (+17%). Trailing badly were Arco (+9%), Unocal (+7%) and Phillips
(+4%).
   To some industry analysts, the story of 1995 was this divergence in the
stock-price performance of the largest oil companies. Their conclusion: it
paid to be big and well-balanced internationally. As an example, Dean
Witter's Eugene Nowak cites Mobil, whose diversity allowed it to use
stronger margins in Singapore to offset weak refining margins for parts of
the year in the US and Europe. The more US-concentrated majors, such as
Arco, Unocal and Phillips, also suffered because of their higher leverage
to domestic natural gas prices, which had a disappointing year.
   The largest companies also attracted more market attention, Schroder
Wertheim's Michael Mayer says, because they tend to raise their dividends
year after year, providing a haven for yield-starved investors.
   The diversity of the biggest oil companies also provided some insulation
as oil prices languished for much of the year, a development that set back
the domestic majors.
   If geographic and sector balance was a key to equity performance in
1995, why was Kerr-McGee among the leaders? Nowak says the company's exit
from the US downstream in 1995 exceeded expectations, with Kerr-McGee
planning to use the $400-mil in proceeds to reduce debt and repurchase
stock. Nowak calls Kerr- McGee his favorite gas play, and sees the stock
gaining more than 10% in the next 12 months.
   The oil group's late kick allowed it to make up some ground on the
overall market. Mayer says many major portfolios were underweighted on oil
stocks during much of 1995, in large part due to OPEC-induced uncertainty
on the direction of oil prices. Once OPEC's mid-November meeting removed
much of the haze--the organization decided to roll over its output ceiling
for another six months--the fund managers began to pour money into the big
oils. The money that rotated into oil was drawn from previously hot stock
groups such as technology and the financials.
   Adding to the impact of firmer oil prices was the surge in US natural
gas prices, which Mayer calls "the icing on the cake."

Bear Stearns Fred Leuffer said the end-year trading rally proves that
investors' "thirst for yield is insatiable," with fund money being drawn by
the relatively strong dividends paid by many large oil companies.
   How will the race in 1996 infold? Many observers do not expect it to be
as enticing as this year's run. "The easy money has been made," says Nowak.
The international majors traditionally have been good values, he says, but
that margin has been narrowed by this year's late run.
   Leuffer is advising investors to trim positions in the major oils now
that a rally has taken place. He says his neutral outlook for the group for
1996 would likely slide to "sell" if not for the yield protection the oil
companies provide.
   Leuffer believes the majors' earnings momentum has peaked. After rising
35% in 1995, the analyst expects operating earnings for the group to
increase only 6% in 1996. Some of this is tied to the fact that
restructurings, and their associated cost cuts, having largely run their
course at most companies.
   Many analysts continue to like Mobil despite its 35% gain in 1995. Mayer
ranks the company as a premier E&P player, saying Mobil invests about
two-thirds of its cash flow on the upstream-- as opposed to the industry
norm of some 85%--yet more than replaces output each year. Mobil is also
seen deriving further savings from its broad restructuring, and is among a
group of 5-7 majors likely to boost dividends in 1996. This yield
protection is shaping up as a key factor in the group's projected
performance for 1996. For an investor in a defensive posture, "the oils are
a decent place to have holdings," Leuffer says.

WEATHER CUTS FORTIES CRUDE OUTPUT TO 550-600,000B/D

(London)
Production of UK Forties Blend crude plummeted to 550-600,000 b/d December
29 as freezing weather conditions caused problems at onshore processing
facilities in Scotland, a source with an equity producer said.
   The source said output was likely to remain at that level for the next
couple of days. Operator BP admitted that production from the fields which
make up the Forties system had now fallen below 800,000 b/d because of the
problems at onshore processing facilities at Kinneil.
   "It's down, it's quite low. We're working on it right now," a BP
spokesman said. "It was 800,000 b/d a while ago (today) and has gone below
800,000 b/d," he said.
   The spokesman was unable to predict when Forties output would return to
normal levels of 1-1.2-mil b/d. "We don't know with the weather being as it
is," he said.
   The equity producer source said Forties production was around 1-mil b/d
in early December and fell to 800,000 b/d "a few days ago" before falling
further December 29.
   Trading sources close to operator BP said a total of 2-mil bbl or the
equivalent of four Forties cargoes had so far been cancelled from the
January loading schedule. "A string of old problems" is expected to push
the current loading schedule back for at least one to two days, one source
said.
   Recent Forties spot trades achieved directionally stronger price
differentials to dated Brent. Mid-January transactions of the grade were
reported late December 28 at around dated Brent plus 20-23 cts or around
$19.01-19.04/bbl.

LIBYA RAISES JANUARY CRUDE PRICES BY 5-20 CTS/BBL

By:
Gerald Bueshel, London.

(London)
   Libya has raised its official selling price for crude liftings in
January by 5-20 cts/bbl, equity sources said Friday.
   The price for Es Sider, the main Libyan export grade, was set at dated
Brent plus 15 cts/bbl, compared to dated Brent minus 5 cts/bbl in
December.
   January OSPs for other grades were announced as follows: Sirtica at
dated Brent plus 18 cts/bbl (up 18 cts from December); Brega and Zueitina
at dated Brent plus 30 cts (up 5 cts); Sarir at dated Brent minus 55 cts
(up 5 cts); Amna at dated Brent minus 60 cts (up 5 cts); Bu Attifel at
dated Brent minus 40 cts (up 5 cts); and Bouri at Iranian Heavy FOB Sidi
Kerir minus 25 cts/bbl (up 5 cts).

MORE TIME ALLOWED FOR BP REFINERY SALE TO TOSCO

(New York)
   BP has pushed back into January the possible shutdown of the Marcus
Hook, Pennsylvania refinery, allowing more time for the union there to
reach a new contract with Tosco, which is buying BP's US Northeast refining
and marketing assets.
   BP had said it would begin to suspend operations at the 190,000 b/d
Marcus Hook plant at the start of January if it was unable to close the
deal with Tosco by the end of 1995. And BP had wanted Tosco to have a new
contract in place with the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers union at the
refinery before closing its deal with Tosco.
   BP now has delayed the potential shutdown until the middle of January, a
company spokesman said December 29. However, a union official said BP has
indicated in talks with OCAW that it would push back the suspension until
the end of the month. The BP spokeswoman had no comment on the union
official's statement.
   BP's current contract with the OCAW expires January 31.
   BP has extended the shutdown deadline to allow more time for the
company, as well as Tosco, to negotiate with the OCAW, the BP spokeswoman
said. BP still must settle severance issues with the union, while Tosco
must negotiate a new contract.
   The spokeswoman said severe winter weather in the Philadelphia area has
delayed its negotiations with the union. She also said BP is encouraged by
the meetings that began last week between Tosco and the OCAW. A bargaining
session between the two was held December 29. Tosco had indicated a desire
to cut refinery staff by 25% and reduce refinery runs by 20%.
   The BP spokeswoman said the company still wants to close the Tosco sale
as soon as possible. Should the company suspend operations at Marcus Hook
in January, it's likely that the sale to Tosco would close in February, she
said.

ACTIVE VLCC TANKER MARKETS

(London)
   South Korean charterers were busy in the VLCC market, with a rash of
fixtures reported Arab Gulf-South Korea, mainly around Worldscale 57-59 for
250-260,000mt lots.
   Despite the Christmas holiday, European charterers were relatively
active, with Mediterranean refiners in particular keen to fix stems out of
the Egyptian port of Sidi Kerir through the first half of the month.
Brokers suggested that owners were for now willing to settle for around
Worldscale 90 on Suezmax ships, but that charterers feared an increase in
rates once the rest of the market returned to work after the New Year
holiday.
   West African business was similarly fairly brisk, with rates creeping
slightly higher, even after factoring in the increase in flat rates for
1996. Late in the week, several fixtures were seen for West
Africa-UKContinent and the Med, while a steady stream of vessels continued
to head West Africa-US Gulf Coast and US Atlantic Coast at rates around
Worldscale 89-90 for 130,000mt.

JAPAN TO HIKE CRUDE OIL RESERVE TO 305-MIL BBL IN FISCAL YEAR 1996

(Tokyo)
   Japan will raise its national strategic crude stockpile by 1.2- bil
liter (7.5-mil bbl) to 48.71-bil liter (304.6-mil bbl) in the next fiscal
year starting April, a source at Agency of Natural Resources and Energy
said Wednesday.
   Ministry of Finance halved the agency's original request for 2.5-bil
liter (15.6-mil bbl) in order to allocate financial resources for
construction of a national strategic LPG stockpile, industry sources said.
   The country's first government-operated LPG reserve complex, with a
capacity of 250,000mt, will be built in Nanao in central Japan's Ishikawa
prefecture next year.
   The national strategic crude stockpile is expected to reach the
government's self-imposed goal of 50-bil liters (312.7-mil bbl) in the
fiscal year 1997-1998, the agency source added.

ASIA: 1995 GOES OUT QUIETLY

   Gasoline cargo prices in Singapore were steady in very quiet trade ahead
of the New Year holiday. The 97 RON unleaded market was supported at $21.50
while 95 RON was flat at $20.95. In the 92 RON market, prices were flat at
$19.75-19.85. Swaps were also unchanged for January and February at
$20.70-21.20.
   The open-spec naphtha market was softer due to the downturn on crude
prices and news that the CDU at the SRC refinery would re-starting on
Sunday. Trade was thin as the market slowed for the holiday break. Second
half February was bid at $175.00 while first half March quoted at
$174.00-175.00. The front half to back half February spread was in
backwardation at $1.75. Singapore paper was weaker with January talked at
$17.50-17.60, February at $17.40-17.50.
   The kerosene market dropped slightly with some selling interest now
apparent in Singapore. A major offered 100,000 bbl, FOB Singapore, for
loading January 23-28 at $32.25. A trader bought the parcel at even with
the market mean, pricing on current day quotes. Another major and a trader
bid for 200,000-250,000 bbl parcels for loading January 14-24 at $32.50.
Reports surfaced that a major was shipping kerosene to Asia from Western
Europe and some talked of shipments from the Caribbean. A major bid for DPK
on a C+F basis into Japan at $34.40-35.20 for delivery January 25-29.
However, there was only interest if the product was shipped directly from a
refinery and not from storage.
   The gasoil paper market tumbled in early Singapore trade with January
done at $26.30, markedly lower that the previous day's close at $25.90. The
drop was attributed to weaker IPE and NYMEX settlements on Thursday and the
closing of positions ahead of the New Year. January paper dropped to as
low as $24.95 before it recovered to around $25.15, a reflection of IPE
strength at the opening. Physical bids were also lower in Singapore as
buyers stepped down almost in line with the weaker paper. A trader bid for
180,000 bbl for loading January 13-17 at $25.75, then at $25.85. A seller
offered 150,000 bbl at $26.00 for loading January 20-24 but no deal was
done. Earlier in the day, a 100,000 bbl parcel traded at 50 cts over the
market mean.
   Despite bearish sentiment in the swaps market, cargo residual fuel oil
prices were stable due to the rebound in crude values. A trader offered
20,000mt of 180 CST at $116.50, then at $117.50, for January 13-17.
   A major bid for that date range at $116.25, then at $117.25. The same
company was also willing to pay $117.00 for January 18-22. A bid for
January 24-28 was seen at $115.75. Later, a 20,000mt trade went on the
books for January 18-22 at $117.00. The 180/380 CST spread was pegged at
$6.50/mt due to tight cutter stock avails. January swaps were done at
$115.00, $114.75, $114.00, $113.00 and $113.50 and February at $108.50 and
$107.40.
   Indonesia is expected to allocate an additional 400,000 bbl of LSWR for
January to its affiliates. Indonesia had allocated 4.15-mil bbl. A
Indonesian affiliate fixed 200,000 bbl of mixed/cracked for second half
January lifting at the Pertamina formula, plus around $1.20, FOB
Indonesia.

EUROPE: QUIET CLOSE

   A couple of first half January premium unleaded barges changed hands at
slightly lower prices, $167.00 and $167.50 for storage material, FOB
Amsterdam/Rotterdam, and $166 for very prompt loading. A regular unleaded
barge sale was reported at $157 for 1,000mt, FOB Rotterdam. Cargo activity,
however, was dead, and the only other business reported was some January
swap action at $169.50-170.00, FOB Rotterdam.
   A flurry of naphtha cargoes was placed ahead of the New Year break as
most dealers headed off early for the weekend. An Egyptian cargo for early
January loading was reported sold into Brazil and another sale was heard
into Canada. A January 10-20 arrival for the Mediterranean was confirmed at
$165.50, CIF Spain, for 70 min paraffins. Swaps values were more difficult
to establish. January and February swap levels were notional at $166-168,
CIF NWE.
   A firm tone was maintained though activity was quiet on the jet fuel
market. Sources expected the firm numbers currently obtainable to attract
avails into the market next week. Buying interest into the UK was still
apparent, but much of traders' attention still focused on moving product
into eastern arbitrage opportunities.
   A Russian gasoil cargo was reported sold into Cyprus at $9 over the high
CIF market quotes. Trade was said very quiet over the day with barges
asking a slightly firmer $1 over the gasoil futures screen. GOM was
reported sold FOB at even with the high CIF market quotes. There was also
talk in the market of an Algerian offered in the Mediterranean at $1.25
over formula with bids at 50 cts over. The North may be moving more into
line with the firm numbers in the Mediterranean, traders said. Delays
reported in the Black Sea may be resolved before the New Year, said
sources, and vessels awaiting loading berths were due to dock at the
weekend.
   High sulfur cracked fuel oil in the Mediterranean was again stronger
with a deal heard into Romania at $114, CIF Constanza. FOB bbl were also
well bid, according to brokers. Low sulfur material was harder to gauge. In
NWE, netback values to the US suggested a much firmer market, but trade was
reported into Italy at $123.25, CIF. Refiner, as well as utility, demand
was reported into Italy. High sulfur barge activity was very thin with
prompt trade heard at $105.50, FOB ARA. Low sulfur barges continued to
benefit from the very cold weather in Europe. An E-4 cargo was said to have
been done at $118, basis Rotterdam.

MTBE: QUIET AND STABLE

   Prices were stable in very quiet trade. Material for very early January
were perceived as tight. A refiner reportedly offered 50,000 bbl for
January 10-15 at 92.75 cts, FOB US Gulf. A producer indicated selling
interest for second half January at 93 cts, FOB US Gulf.
   In the Northeast, buying interest was again reported at close to 100 cts
in New York Harbor.

GAS LIQUIDS: PROPANE STILL CLIMBING

   December non-TET propane was done at 38.50 cts at Mt Belvieu in the
morning. But trade thinned with many players leaving early for the New Year
holiday.
   A trader bought normal butane at 38.50 cts for December. January normal
butane sold at 39.50 cts.
   Activity at Conway was extremely quiet. December Warren bbl of natural
gasoline sold at 41.75 cts and 42.00 cts.

ATLANTIC COAST: READY FOR HOLIDAYS

   Unleaded gasoline markets were thinly traded. Sources said that many
traders were "out of the saddle" getting ready to "pop the corks" and
celebrate the New Year.
   Prompt RFG regular unleaded 87 barge offers held at 150 points under the
January screen while bids languished at 200 points under. Softer front half
January RFG Boston unleaded cargo talk was heard at 125-160 points under
the January print.
   Oxygenated RFG regular unleaded 87 barge talk weakened to even to 50
points over the January screen. Softer RFG premium unleaded 93 values were
seen at 3.50-3.75 cts over the January print. Oxygenated RFG premium
unleaded 93 talked at 6.25-6.50 cts over January futures.
   Talk for conventional regular unleaded 87 barges slipped to 5.75-6.25
cts under the January print. Conventional premium unleaded 93 barge values
were seen at 1.75-2.00 cts under the January screen.
   Differentials to the futures screen for No.2 heating oil slipped on the
back of sharply lower NYMEX prices. Prompt No.2 oil barge offers were seen
at 25 points under the January screen, bids were 50 points under. Front
half January Boston No.2 cargo values were pegged at 20-40 points over the
January screen.
   Low sulfur No.2 oil talked at parity with regular No.2 oil. Slightly
softer 54 grade jet fuel talk was heard at 1.20-1.40 cts over the No.2
print. Low sulfur jet/kero, 55 grade, values held at 4.50-4.75 cts over the
No.2 screen.
   Residual fuel oil traders ended 1995 on a quiet note. Most weren't
especially eager to buy or sell and potential selling interest was mostly
limited to a few looking to move foreign low sulfur cargoes.
   Little discussion was heard for 0.3%S H/P and L/P as traders waited for
a New York utility to award its H/P tender for January 10-20 on January 4.
Sellers of 0.3%S L/P barges could still be found at $23.00-23.25.
   Nothing new was seen on the physical 1.0%S market. The "best bid" seen
was at $21.50. Values for January 1.0%S paper were little changed with
sales reported at $20.20, $20.25 and possibly at $20.35.
   Late Thursday, a trader sold its South American 1.7%S cargo at a
market-related high plus 50 cts, delivered to a New England utility. Values
for high sulfur material held near $18.00. New York 380 CST bunker sales
were last heard at $130.

US GULF COAST: A MODEST YEAR-END UPTURN

   Unleaded gasoline prices firmed on the pipeline as a major stepped in to
pick up a few bbl. At one point the market was pushed to 710 points below
the February gasoline futures print. By the end of the day, most called the
first cycle 730 points off.
   Premium unleaded looked a bit stronger at 3.0 cts over regular unleaded
and 93 octane material was another 1.0 cts over that.
   No.2 heating oil was still tight on the water. A 90,000mt ship was taken
to export for the Far East and most put the waterborne market about a 50-75
points over the pipeline. On the pipeline, high sulfur No.2 oil traded as
low as 420 points under the February futures print, slightly less than
Thursday's levels.
   Low sulfur diesel was 15-25 points lower than high sulfur. Jet fuel on
the prompt cycle was 225 points below the February print, while low sulfur
jet fuel sat at 150 points over. Both of those differentials were unchanged
from Thursday.
   Residual fuel oil values were up on the bunker market with $105 reported
for 380 CST at Houston. Most attributed the strength to "distress buying"
for the holiday.
   There was little bulk market activity, but the consensus was that while
more product was available, good export demand remained. Talk on 1.0%S was
higher as well due to the possibility of Florida buying above its contract
requirements.

FUTURES: THIN AND VOLATILE

   The session on NYMEX was dominated by expiration-related activity on the
products, traders said, and resulted in a sharp sell-off in January heating
oil and a milder decline in January unleaded.
   February crude rallied to a new contract high near the close. Some
traders left early, or failed to appear to trade, before the long holiday
weekend and that left trading thin and volatile. Additionally, the IPE
closed at 1300 GMT and that tended to erase some direction from the
market.
   January heating oil, which from early December until Thursday had led
the NYMEX energy complex higher, dropped for the second consecutive
session. Traders tied the decline to expiration-related long liquidation,
profit taking and hedge unwinding. "It's the last day of the last month for
that contract and hedgers and speculators who were long during the recent
price run-up got out," a trader said. The contract also came under pressure
over the past two days due to expectations of moderating temperatures.
   January heating oil began its recent rise at the beginning of December
around 52.00 cts and peaked at the contract high of 62.45 cts on Thursday.
However, profit-taking prior to expiration caused it to drop more than 4
cts in two days. January heating oil closed down 169 points at 58.63 cts.
   January unleaded, which also expired, was under pressure much of the
session on expiration-related activity. Thought the contract recovered from
its lows, the market was too illiquid to really discern much about
direction. January unleaded closed off 42 points at 58.86 cts.
   February crude was range-bound after gaining early on an unexpectedly
low US crude stock figure as reported by API. While crude received some
support from its stock draw, the draws in heating oil and unleaded failed
to support those contracts. "The market tends to ignore the figures
following the initial reaction," a trader said.
   However, in the final minutes of trading the February crude contract
found renewed strength as the market stabilized and it broke above
resistance at the previous contract high of $19.55 to set a new high at
$19.57.

US WEST COAST: PRICES SLIP INTO '96

   The end of 1995 approached quietly in Los Angeles with little talk heard
for most products. Los Angeles unleaded languished at the previous day's
level of 57.00-58.00 cts with few buyers seen. Talk was mostly notional
with some narrower ranges heard.
   Traders said it appeared the Portland unleaded market was starting to
slide a little faster. The range dipped to 54.25-55.25 cts as the market
continued to "figure things out" following the reopening of the pipeline
from Seattle.
   Bay unleaded was said to be losing ground to Los Angeles and talked at
least 1.50 cts lower than Los Angeles. Oxy was reported done at 2.50 cts
over Bay unleaded. Reformulated talk was no higher than 2.00 cts over Los
Angeles conventional unleaded.
   Jet fuel prices in Los Angeles appeared closer to the 66.25 cts level at
which the last reported deal was done. Apparently little was getting done,
but there continued to be enough outside pressure in the form of refinery
problems and Asian prices to keep jet supported.
   A CARB seller in Los Angeles was reportedly looking for 67.00 cts early
while the Bay was pegged around 62.50 cts. Low sulfur No. 2 oil held steady
through the day at 60.00-61.25 cts with 60.00 cts reported done in Los
Angeles for the back half of the month. Portland L/S No.2 oil talked lower
at 57.75-58.75 cts.
   Demand into the fuel oil market screeched to a halt on the last trading
day of the year. Traders scrambled to supply what was left of the demand in
the bunker market.
   In Los Angeles, sources reported that bunker-C sold at $111.50,
resulting in a slight increase in the price of 380 CST and 180 CST.

US CRUDE: TALK OF SUPPLY PROBLEMS

   The steady march to stronger prices in Gulf Coast grades continued on
Friday. The tight avails of crude in the US Gulf has been pushing prices
higher as refiners seek out alternate, cheaper crudes.
   According to one trader, the Brent replacement cost on Thursday was
February WTI plus 42 cts and that contributed to the gains seen in LLS.
That sweet grade climbed several cents above Thursday's levels which were
stronger than Wednesday's levels. February LLS was heard traded at 68, 69
and 70 cts over Cushing WTI, with 70 cts over Cushing WTI said to have been
done 10 to 12 times. That topped Thursday's high of 65 cts.
   February Midland WTI was done at 8-10 cts under Cushing WTI, actually
priced into the Gulf and not into Cushing. The February WTS talk level
firmed. One trader suggested, that with the climb in LLS prices, refiners
might turn to WTS because of the wide differential, as much as $1.00-1.65.
"They would run as much as possible until they 'max out' and their
desulfurization units halt," he said.
   Production problems which cut four January Forties cargoes, cold weather
effects on refineries overseas and production problems in certain fields
created a supply problem in crude worldwide, traders noted. The bottom
line, another said, is "crude is tight, crude is strong."
   There were numerous and persistent reports of activity in South American
crude, but, due to an absence of traders prior to the long weekend, the
reports remained unconfirmed. In addition, a trader said that information
appeared to be flowing less freely than it had in the past.
   A second half February Cano Limon said on offer at WTI minus $1.20 and,
while buyer and seller were confirmed, the selling price could not be
verified. There was talk that an end-January or February Vasconia had
traded, but details weren't available. Several traders doubted reports that
up to four cargoes of Oriente had traded around the ANS minus 40 cts level.
The doubt was due to uncertainty about whether Petroecuador will change its
pricing formula in February.
   No West Coast ANS sales were reported by the main spot seller.

INTERNATIONAL CRUDE: UNEVENTFUL

   The 15-day Brent market was uneventful with two February Brent cargoes
done at $18.53 and a partial done at $18.51. February Brent/Dubai talked at
$1.20-1.25 while February/March Dubai talked at plus 24-30 cts and
March/April Dubai talked at plus 21-25 cts. January 2-5 Brent CFDs were
pegged at February plus 35-40 cts. January 8-12 Brent CFDs were valued
around February plus 15 cts.
   Prompt physical Brent values moved lower versus February when a January
4-6 cargo changed hands early at February plus 30 cts. But two late-day
trades tightened the market. A January 15-17 was done at 5 cts under
January, equivalent to February plus 67 cts. It was later re-sold at
February plus 60 cts. Talk was tighter during the day so the late deal
coincided somewhat with the market. However, next week's CFDs were rumored
done at plus 37 cts. Based on the three trades, the market was valued at
February plus 52 cts.
   In other dated Brent talk, most were waiting for fresh second decade
January offers while seven sets of Brent dates were kept from the chains.
Six of the dates were kept by a UK major said to hold up to 13 physical
Brent cargoes. Little action took place in other North Sea markets with
Oseberg price differentials to dated widening. An end-January cargo of the
grade was heard done at dated plus 37 cts.
   West African markets were fairly quiet with many still absent due to the
holiday season. The general tone for BQ and Forcados price differentials to
dated was said "reasonably strong." Recent trades were seen breaking the
dated plus 50 ct mark. Offers for light Nigerian grades, loading towards
end-January, were said at the mid 50s over dated Friday.
   Mediterranean Urals trade was thin though prices firmed on back of tight
avails with one deal done at dated plus 15 cts, C+F Augusta, for 80,000mt.
Although the port of Novorossiisk re-opened late Thursday, 19 vessels were 
reportedly waiting to load. Sources said Mediterranean refiners were
seeking alternative crude supplies and were replacing their sour crude
requirements with sweet North Sea barrels.

ABB REORGANIZED TO IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE

Dr Richard J Slember, president, ABB Power Plant Operations (US),
headquartered in Stamford, Conn, announces several changes in the areas of
sales/marketing, nuclear systems, fossil systems, services, controls, and
R&D. These changes, made public over the last few weeks, are a major part
of Slember's plan to build a more closely knit organization--one that can
"get the synergy out of ABB" and better serve the customer.
   Slember, who joined ABB Asea Brown Boveri in November 1990, told Power
that he expects to make a few more announcements in the coming months as he
fine-tunes his organization; however, these will be primarily personnel
assignments and not involve structural changes to the organization.
   Unified sales force. Perhaps the most significant of Slember's recent
announcements is the appointment of Michael Bray to head a newly formed,
unified US sales force to serve all units of ABB Power Plant Operations
except the nuclear and services groups. The new organization is now ABB's
primary interface with electric utilities for boilers, steam and gas
turbines, environmental control equipment, and powerplant controls.
   It was created in response to feedback from utilities, which had
requested a more focused customer-service organization. Says Slember, "This
action brings together an unparalleled offering in meeting customer
requirements. ABB, with a single organization, can now meet the customer's
needs for the entire powerplant, from fuel feed to stack."
   The Power Plant Operations sales force will operate from five regional
offices, coordinated by Bray from ABB's Windsor (Conn) facility. Regional
vice presidents are Andrew Cook, East, based in Windsor; Michael Salerno,
Southwest, Atlanta; Steven Deabler, Southwest, Dallas; Vincent Pacello,
Central, Chicago. The western regional vice president, to be located in
California, is still unnamed.
   Nuclear. Dr Shelby Brewer is appointed chairman, ABB Combustion
Engineering Nuclear Power, with responsibility for strategic customers,
government relations, and long-term positioning of the company's nuclear
businesses. Brewer joined Combustion Engineering Inc in 1984 as vice
president of operations for the Nuclear Power Systems Div.
   In a related appointment, Peter S Van Nort is named president, ABB
Combustion Engineering Nuclear Power, responsible for the operations of ABB
Impell and the company's nuclear-power business units: systems, fuel
services, and associated staff. Van Nort has been with ABB for about a
year, serving in upper-management positions.
   Boilers. Frank Fagan is appointed senior manager of ABB's boiler
business. Fagan, with over 30 years of experience in fossil-fueled
steam-generation technology and most recently president of ABB Combustion
Engineering Services Inc, will concentrate on developing ABB's global
boiler strategies and on optimizing the implementation of those strategies
in the US marketplace.
   Services. David M Gray becomes president, ABB Combustion Engineering
Services, replacing Fagan (see above). Gray, with extensive executive and
operations experience in the boiler business--most recently as vice
president of fossil services--is responsible for all service-related work
on operating boilers, world-wide. These services include all of the parts
and components used to maintain, rehabilitate, and upgrade boilers; the
engineering and design work to support that effort; field engineering
services; and training, testing, and analysis services. Gray's group also
is involved in the construction of new boilers, precipitators, scrubbers,
and related powerplant equipment, and provides commissioning services for
new boilers.
   Gray told Power that he sees a large amount of clean-air-related service
work down the road, but that this activity has not yet started in earnest
because federal and state regulations governing powerplant emissions are
not "final." Today, the boiler-service business essentially is in a
no-growth period, with activity dominated by normal rehabilitation
andpressure-part work. Considerable effort also is going into planning with
customers to ensure a prompt response to regulatory requirements when
specific clean-air guidelines are announced. One change in the services
business as it was envisioned only a few years ago, according to Gray, is
that many utilities are now looking to shut down old boilers rather than to
extend their life--this to facilitate complying with expected clean-air
statutes.
   Controls. Edward H Verdery is appointed president of ABB's new Power
Plant Controls business unit, incorporating the following preexisting
company operations: fossil instrumentation and control operations from
ABB's old Power Automation, Fossil Systems, and Fossil Services units and
the powerplant training simulator and computer businesses of the Power
Automation and Nuclear groups.
   In making this organizational change, Slember notes "In the past, the
powerplant operator had to use a piecemeal approach for plant control,
using equipment from various vendors for each part of the plant--for
example, boilers, turbines, or environmental control. We now have greater
breadth of offering in plant control and can match the control system to
the equipment, to optimize plant performance." The objective of integrated
controls is to lower costs to the operator, increase plant availability,
and minimize pollutant emissions.
   R&D. Finally, in an effort to weave a technology network from Europe to
the US, Slember names Dr Gernot Gessinger vice president of research and
technology. In his newly created position, Gessinger, a 20-yr ABB veteran,
is responsible for the establishment of R&D programs for all ABB Power
Plant operation in the US.

IN AN UNDERTAKING AS COMPLEX AND COSTLY AS POWERPLANT DEVELOPMENT--WHERE
STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE DESIGN AND
OPERATION OF A PLANT--PROJECT STAKEHOLDERS MUST BE AMPLY PREPARED FOR
REGULATORY AND PUBLIC OVERSIGHT.

By:
Marie Leone

At least one industry expert, Peter Mason, Bechtel Corp, San Francisco,
Calif, suggests the simple old-fashioned matrix system. He says this
evaluation tool has been successfully tested with nuclear powerplants, and
can easily be adapted to other types of facilities. In a talk to the recent
ASME Joint Power Generation Conference, Mason pointed out that many
technical issues relating to power-project work originate as safety or
environmental licensing concerns, often tied to legislation. He cites as a
good example the nuclear industry's design review process which takes place
before and after project completion. Often sparked by internal or external
audits, inspections, reviews, and/or employee concerns, intervenor
allegations, or hearing contentions, such issues can potentially delay, or
in some extreme cases, terminate projects--as was the case with the
Shoreham nuclear plant in New York which was prohibited from operating
commercially after construction and testing were complete.
   Mason's proactive approach includes a review, resolution, and analysis
of the issues and their root cause. By identifying and listing issues and
setting up cause matrices, project planners and plant-design experts can
identify problems before they become unmanageable, says Mason, who cites
the following example: The matrix evaluation method is used to design and
build a new waste-to-energy plant. After the plant begins operation, a
public citizen's group raises safety concerns about the type of waste fuel
being used and the toxicity of the ash. Local environmental regulators
question the plant owners, who in turn, are able to use the matrix to round
up information and redirect the questions back to relevant technical
documentation. Asa result, a convenient record of consistent information is
supplied to support the plant owner's decisions and safety-design
strategies.
   The matrix approach is designed to prevent those involved in project
development from overreacting or being scarred off by problems that can be
solved, notes Mason, adding that the issue-resolution step must remain a
technical, not a legal or quality-assurance matter, and thus must start
with a strong technical basis. More importantly, the process provides a
history of potential problems and technical resolutions so there is a
reference file for new powerplants. Often, problems that management assumes
are new have actually occurred before and have been solved, but the
"corporate memory" fails, says Mason.

RECENT COURT RULINGS AND LAWSUITS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE WASTE-TO-ENERGY
(WTE) PLANTS, AS WELL AS COAL-FIRED FACILITIES, HAVE UNDERSCORED THE NEED
FOR DEFINITIVE REGULATION ON ASH FROM POWERPLANTS.

By:
Marie Leone

In a decision that may go before the US Supreme Court, a federal appeals
court has ruled that ash generated by municipal-solid-waste (MSW) burning
plants is subject to regulation as a hazardous waste (Subtitle C) under the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The decision by the US Court
of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reverses a lower court decision based on
a 1988 lawsuit filed by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), Washington,
DC, against the city of Chicago. The latest decision raises the possibility
of higher disposal costs for MSW facilities located in Wisconsin, Indiana,
and Illinois--the court's jurisdiction. However, industry observers say
that the decision will not have a significant impact because most ash
tested under the existing EPA procedures does not exceed the regulatory
threshold for hazardous wastes, reports Independent Power Report, a
McGraw-Hill Inc newsletter. But although this particular ruling may not
hurt the industry, the fact that no clear-cut rule exists leaves the door
open for future complications that could aggravate project development,
warn industry sources.
   For example, based on a 1980 EPA rule, Congress voted to exempt
"household waste" from RCRA's definition of hazardous waste. In an effort
to further clarify the exemption, Congress added a section to the law in
1984 stating that a waste-to-energy plant "shall not be deemed to be
treating, storing, disposing of, or otherwise managing hazardous wastes, so
long as the plant receives and burns only household waste or solid waste
from commercial or industrial sources that does not contain hazardous
wastes." Since then, industry experts have interpreted this to mean that if
the fuel-waste delivered to the plant is not hazardous, then it follows
that the ash coming out is non-hazardous as well, and should be categorized
under RCRA's Subtitle D. However, the recent Chicago ruling disallowed that
interpretation. Chief Judge William Bauer wrote in the majority opinion
that the "ash is fundamentally different in its chemical and physical
composition from the plastic, paper, and other rubbish that goes in."
   Regarding coal, the Oregon-based Citizens Interested in Bull Run Inc is
suing EPA to force a decision about whether to regulate coal-combustion
waste by electric-utility plants as hazardous or non-hazardous. Under the
1980 RCRA amendments, EPA was ordered to complete a report on
coal-combustion wastes and finalize a rule no later than six months after
the completion of the report. Although the report was completed in 1988,
EPA has yet to make a decision on the classification of coal ash. The
primary concern over disposal of the waste is the potential for leachate to
contaminate groundwater. Small quantities of arsenic, barium, cadmium,
lead, mercury, selenium, and other contaminants are known to be present in
coal ash.
   A decision to characterize coal-combustion wastes as hazardous will
significantly raise ash-disposal costs for coal-fired plants, say industry
observers. That becomes important when considering new generating capacity
and comparing the cost of coal-fired plants with other options. Note that
key members of Congress are pushing to amend RCRA sometime this year
(Power, December 1991, p 9).

DRAFT LEGISLATION AIMED AT SUBSIDIZING THE RENEWABLE-ENERGY INDUSTRY IS
DRAWING FIRE FROM INDUSTRY GROUPS.

By:
Marie Leone

The House proposal would establish a 2.5 cents/kWh incentive payment for a
total of 10 years for electricity produced from solar, wind, biomass, and
certain forms of geothermal energy. To pay for the incentive, Congress
would impose a user fee averaging one-third of a mill (one-thirtieth of a
cent) per kWh on electric generation. The fee would be capped at one-half
mill per kWh.
   The Edison Electric Institute, Washington DC, opposes the draft, saying
it is an energy tax that would skew the energy market. In addition, a
spokesman for the National Assn of Regulatory Utility Commissions (Naruc)
says Naruc will oppose the proposal, noting that although "we support
renewable energy, our traditional policy is to oppose energy fees or taxes
imposed by the federal government because in the end they are passed on to
the ratepayers."
   Conversely, representatives from the renewable energy industry maintain
that the proposal would firmly establish the US as a leader in renewable
energy technology and help renewables find a permanent place in the US
energy supply mix.

TECHNICAL PROFILES OF CURRENT PROJECTS AS REPORTED IN MCGRAW-HILL ENERGY
GROUP'S ELECTRIC UTILITY WEEK, INDEPENDENT POWER REPORT, AND NUCLEONICS
WEEK NEWSLETTERS

Utilities in the Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC) say peak
demand will increase by an average of 1.9%/yr through 1999. To meet this
growth, utilities plan to add 6631 MW of net operable capacity during the
decade. Figure includes new construction and reactivation of units now in
cold shutdown. The only utilities in the region planning more than 500 MW
of new construction are Arizona Public Service Co (535 MW), Los Angeles
Dept of Water & Power (506 MW), Nevada Power Co (710 MW), Sacramento
Municipal Utility District (550 MW), and San Diego Gas & Electric Co (698
MW). All of the new capacity would be gas-fired peaking or combined-cycle
units. The only base-load units in the forecast are the expected return to
service of Public Service Co of Colorado's Ft St. Vrain nuclear plant as a
gas-fired steam/electric unit in 1995 and Southern California Edison Co's
reactivation of the oil-fired, 320-MW Alamitos Unit 3 in 1996, oil-fired,
126-MW San Bernardino Units 1 and 2 in 1997, oil-fired, 132-MW Etiwanda
Unit 1 in 1998, gas-fired, 215-MW Huntington Beach Unit 3 in 1999, and the
gas-fired, 180-MW Highgrove Unit 3 in 1999. Non-utility generation (NUG)
additions in the region are expected to total 2655 in the 1991-1999
period. Utilities planning more than 200 MW of NUGs are Nevada Power (377
MW), Pacific Gas & Electric Co (498 MW), Public Service Colorado (628 MW),
Puget Sound Power & Light Co (296 MW), and Southern California Edison (514
MW). Major new-capacity additions by utilities in the WSCC region include
the following: Portland General Electric Co, a 210-MW combined-cycle plant
for operation in July 1998; Arizona Public Service, three 70-MW combustion
turbines in 1998, two more in 1999, and another in year 2000; LADWP, a
240-MW combined-cycle in 1994, plus unspecified additions of 100 MW in
1997, 1999, and 2000 and 200 MW in 1998; Nevada Power, combined-cycle
conversions of Clark Units 5 and 6 in 1993 and Units 7 and 8 in 1994, plus
70-MW combustion-turbine additions in 1994, 1995, and 1996; San Diego Gas
& Electric, 230-MW combined-cycles in 1995 and 1996 and 224-MW combined
cycles in 1998 and 2000; SMUD plans to add its 550 MW in 1996, but no
details are available. Houston Lighting & Power Co plans a 160-MW,
gas-fired cogeneration project at a DuPont Corp facility in LaPorte, Tex,
that would be owned by the utility as a traditional rate-based plant.
Commercial operation of the $120-million (not including land, switchyard,
and transmission expenses) facility is expected in mid 1995 . . . Black
Hills Power & Light Co asks the Wyoming Industrial Siting Council to waive
a permit application for its proposed 80-MW, coal-fired Simpson Unit 2 so
the utility can begin construction by August 1993 . . . Thermo Electron
Corp, Energy Systems Div, Waltham, Mass, selects United Engineers &
Constructors Inc to design a 21-MW, biomass-fired powerplant in Delano,
Calif. A fluidized-bed boiler will be installed. Construction start is
expected in the spring of 1992; project completion by the end of 1993 . . .
US Windpower Inc, Livermore, Calif, and InterCoast Energy Co, a unit of
Iowa-Illinois Gas & Electric Co, form a joint venture--WindRiver
Development Co, Davenport, Iowa--to develop at least 250 MW of
wind-generated capacity in the Midwest . . . Wheelabrator Environmental
Systems, Hampton, NH, joins Decker Energy International Inc, Winter Haven,
Fla, as a partner in a 40-MW woodwaste- and waste-tire-fired project in
Polk County, Fla, near Lakeland. Schedule calls for a January 1994
startup, but state and federal air permits have not yet been obtained . . .
Southern Electric International Inc, Atlanta, Ga, considers
co-developing a $20-million office-paper recycling plant with DeNovo Corp,
Washington, DC, that would use 60,000 lb/hr of steam from SEI's planned
220-MW, pulverized-coal-fired cogeneration project near Fredricksburg, Va.
The powerplant project was selected by Virginia Power in its 1989
solicitation under the assumption that a steam host could be developed . . .
General Electric Co, Schenectady, NY, estimates that about 69,000 MW of
NUG capacity will be ordered in the US between 1991 and year 2000, with
the Southeast the most significant market region in the 1990s. Estimate is
higher than those of others because the GE number is for plant orders
rather than completed facilities . . . East Kentucky Power Cooperative Inc
selects its own bid for 300 MW of gas-fired peaking capacity, needed by
mid-1995, over those from 11 private developers. The utility based 60% of
the bid scoring on price, remainder on non-price criteria such as
reliability and environmental issues. . . Texas Utilities Electric Co's
"information request" soliciting cogenerators and independent power
producers for expressions of interest for long-term, firm generating

Island, NY, selects American Ref-Fuel, Houston, Tex, to build a
$250-million, 1500-ton/day waste-to-energy plant . . . Pinellas County,
Fla, which operates a 3150-ton/day waste-to-energy plant shelves plans to
expand facility throughput by as much as 50% because actual volumes have
fallen far below projections for several reasons, among them: drought and
related water restrictions, the economic downturn (less new construction,
fewer tourists, etc), little or no population growth, recycling of waste .
 . . Wisconsin Electric Power Co plans to build a 160-MW cogen plant at the
largest paper mill in the state--Repap Wisconsin Inc's Kimberly facility .
 . . KVA Resources Inc, Bellevue, Wash, agrees to joint-venture with
Columbia Aluminum to build a 210-MW, gas-fired combined-cycle plant near

at the smelter. If permitting proceeds according to plan, the plant could
be in operation as early as September 1993 . . . Towner Electric LP,
Minneapolis, Minn, and an unnamed utility plan to develop a 440-MW,
coal-gasification project in New Jersey that would also produce 25-million
gal/yr of methanol for use as a gasoline additive or as an alternative to
motor fuel for areas--like New Jersey--where ozone levels must be lowered
to comply with the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Power would be sold
to Public Service Electric & Gas Co under an agreement specifying that an
80% capacity factor be maintained by the new project or it would be
responsible for the cost of replacement power . . . Tennessee Valley
Authority expects to add up to 220 MW of hydroelectric capacity over the
next 10 years by investing an estimated $100-million in a retrofit program
to upgrade turbine runners. First contract in the program, for replacement
runners at Wilson and Chicamauga dams, was awarded last October to Voith

COAL HANDLING AND PREPARATION
Although the basics remain the same, the many elements comprising coal
handling and preparation in the powerplant have taken on a new luster--put
there by the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments

By:
Thomas C Elliott, Senior Editor

Coal cleaning at the mine, transportation to the powerplant, site
unloading, stockout and storage, reclaiming, feeders and conveyors,
preparation, blending and switching, overall instrumentation and
control--these are the key topics reviewed in this report. The underlying
theme is the pervasive impact of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990
(CAA), which has so altered the thinking about powerplant operation in the
years ahead (see Power Special Report, "Clean Air Act Amendments: The
Engineering Response," June 1991). Until these amendments became law,
precombustion technologies were merely a part of the landscape, advancing
mostly as the occasion demanded. Now they are at center stage, key players
in the struggle to slash powerplant emissions at the stack before they
become problems.
   Evidence of a renewed emphasis on precombustion technologies is
compelling (also see box, p 18). For example, the idea of constructing a
common coal-preparation plant serving several large power stations is being
discussed today as a business venture similar to independent power
production. In addition, at least one midwestern utility reportedly is
investigating the construction of a centrally located coal-blending station
serving many of the utilities affected by CAA.

COAL CLEANING
   About one-third of US steam coal (over 200-million tons) is cleaned to
remove ash and sulfur impurities and to increase the coal's heating value.
Most of the costs of coal cleaning are borne by mining companies, who build
and operate the cleaning facilities and dispose of the refuse removed from
the coal in the cleaning process (Figure 1). The mining companies pass some
of these expenses along to powerplants in higher coal prices.

Clean-coal benefits
Utilities are burning more cleaned coal each year because they find that
the savings it offers in fuel handling, plant efficiency, availability, and
environmental controls compensate for the added cost. More specifically,
improved coal quality can result in:
   --A reduction of up to 20% in transportation costs.
   --Reduced pulverizer operation and maintenance (O&M) costs because there
will be less hard mineral matter to pulverize.
   --Increased boiler availability, efficiency, and life expectancy because
of reduced slagging, fouling, corrosion, and erosion.
   --Reduced electrostatic-precipitator or fabric-filter O&M costs because
there will be less particulate matter to capture.
   With the tighter controls on SO subscript 2 emissions mandated by the
CAA, it will be interesting to see in which direction utilities lean with
regard to the precombustion alternatives of coal cleaning, blending, and
purchasing of low-sulfur coals. Since the latter two are generally less
expensive, the scales may tip toward them. Even now, low-sulfur western
coals are becoming increasingly attractive compared to flue-gas
desulfurization.

Commercial techniques
   Basic coal-cleaning techniques are covered in detail in McGraw-Hill
Inc's Standard Handbook of Powerplant Engineering, "Coal Cleaning," Sec 4,
Pt 1, Ch 2, and in Power's Special Report, Coal cleaning, September 1981;
also, March 1987, p 76, and August 1990, p 77. However, two leading-edge
commercial techniques worth mentioning are these:
   --Improved hydraulic jig effectively cleans fine coal--a growing
challenge as new mining methods produce finer coal particles for greater
sulfur liberation. This fine-coal jig uses hydraulic separation to stratify
a bed of different-density particles through the application of a pulsating
water stream. Microprocessor-controlled air valves regulate the length of
pulsation strokes, allowing raw-coal cleaning down to 100 microns.
   --Conventional heavy-media coal-cleaning process has been refined in
this fashion: (1) A new type of magnetite is used with optimized physical
and mechanical properties, (2) the cyclone separation step is enhanced, and
(3) the recovery of magnetite has been significantly improved. These
process refinements pertain to the fines cleaning circuit only; the
coarse-material circuit is the same as a conventional prep plant.
   Processes nearing commercial status are the thermal drying of low-rank
coals, principally low-sulfur western coals, and the production of pellets
from these dried coals, which typically crumble and become very dusty. In
both cases, the objective is to reduce transportation costs and make the
coal more attractive to eastern markets.

Advanced techniques
   Some advanced techniques are these, which are at the bench-scale, pilot,
or demonstration stages:
   --Agglomeration. Here, a light hydrocarbon--such as heptane--is
introduced to agglomerate spherical coal particles. Wet, raw coal is ground
to 20 mesh, is mixed vigorously with heptane in a high-shear contactor,
then enters a low-shear mixer where asphalt is added as a binder. After
agitation, the agglomerates are drained of water and refuse particles. At
this point, steam sparging captures the heptane for reuse. Finally, the
resulting coal pellets are water-washed to remove any trace of impurities.
   --Froth flotation. This is a physical/chemical process that depends on
the attachment of air bubbles to high-carbon-content hydrophobic solids.
Separation of coal occurs as dispersed air bubbles pass through a
suspension of fine raw-coal concentrate. Additives are usually required to
enhance the hydrophobic character of the coal particles relative to the
hydrophilic nature of the mineral matter.
   --Column flotation. This process takes advantage of the differences in
surface chemistries of coal and mineral matter, which affect the way these
particles interact with water and air bubbles. The fine-refuse slurry is
introduced into an 8-ft-diameter, 22-ft-high column. Air bubbles rising
from the column's bottom help to separate coal particles from waste
material and carry them to the top of the column, where they are skimmed
off.
   --Chemical process. Here, mine-cleaned coal is treated with sodium
hydroxide and potassium hydroxide to transfer organic and pyritic sulfur
and mineral matter into the molten alkali. Because of the high density of
the caustic melt, the clean coal floats to the surface of the reactor and
is separated out. Molten caustic is recycled; the cleaned coal is further
washed with water and dilute acid.
   --Biological process. Still in the embryonic state, bioprocessing
involves the use of micro-organisms, such as bacteria and fungi, to
catalyze sulfur-removal reactions. Studies show that 99% of pyritic sulfur
can be removed by the micro-organism thiobacillus ferroxidans. Especially
attractive is the use of bioprocessing for the removal of organically bound
sulfur, which is resistant to conventional coal cleaning; in the US,
research centers around removal using model compounds (dibenzothiophene,
polysulfides, and humic acids) to determine the mechanism of direct
cleavage of sulfur from coal. High cost may be an obstacle to selecting
this process.

TRANSPORTATION

Transportation from mine to powerplant is via unit train, barge, truck,
overland conveyor belt, or any combination of these modes. The system
selected depends on such factors as distance from mine to plant, daily
"burn rate," location of plant site, and relative economics of competing
transportation modes.

Unit trains
   More than half of the nation's coal-fired steam generators are fed by
unit-train coal delivery (Figure 2). A typical coal train is comprised of
about 110 cars, with each car carrying about 100 tons of coal--an
11,000-ton-capacity train continuously operating back and forth between
coal source and plant like a shuttle. Many utilities own their unit trains
outright, with these benefits: reduced freight rates, better railcar
availability, greater degree of control over scheduling and maintenance.
   Of interest today are shipments of low-sulfur coal from the Powder River
Basin in Wyoming to eastern destinations. Because of CAA, this coal (at
roughly $4/ton) is becoming increasingly attractive. Fears that shortages
and bottlenecks in moving this coal eastward in the years ahead, spurred by
burgeoning demand, appear to be groundless.
   These questions most often arise: Will shipment costs rise precipitously
in a demand economy? Will there be enough railcars to handle the rising
load? Will there be enough trackage? Will scheduling be a problem? The
answers are encouraging.
   Railroad management is not about to take advantage of its good
customers, especially since coal suppliers/users form a solid base for its
overall business (annual tonnages are more than three times greater than
the second largest commodity, farm products). Although costs may rise, they
will reflect competitive conditions and not those of a captive marketplace.
While it is true that railcar manufacture annually is considerably less
than 15 years ago (100,000 cars plus vs 40,000 or so today), most cars can
accommodate more coal and weigh less (being aluminum-bodied), thus can
carry an extra five to 10 tons of coal without exceeding track weight
limitations. New routes shouldn't be necessary, although reinforcements in
selected areas, upgrading of some trackage, extended siding lengths, and
double trackage may be required. Most important, railroads generally are
run better--they operate faster, more efficiently, with better scheduling.
   With regard to freeze control, thaw sheds at the plant site are still
the most common solution to arriving shipments of frozen coal, although the
high operating costs associated with these systems restrict their use to
the largest utilities. Friable western coals are more prone to hard
freezeups because of their high fines concentrations.
   Freeze-conditioning agents (FCAs) are receiving increased attention
because of their effectiveness in many applications. Some act as an
anti-freeze while others weaken the crystalline structure of ice. A
recently introduced FCA consists of50% glycol with special wetting agents
for freeze conditioning during rail transport. A recent field study
suggests that treating the sides of a coal car with FCAs could be more
effective than treating the coal itself.

Barges
   Where feasible, barge delivery usually offers the lowest cost per
ton-mile, whether for coal or other bulk materials. As a result, US inland
waterways have been extensively developed, with most coal traffic on the
Ohio, Monogahela, Mississippi, and Tennessee rivers. A typical barge for
coal transportation is an open hopper vessel measuring 195 ft long, 35 ft
wide, 12 ft deep, and loaded to about 1500 tons at an 8- to 10-ft draft.
Typically, 15 barges are ganged together, pushed by a tugboat, in an
arrangement called a "unit tow," which carries 22,500 tons of coal.
   While inexpensive, barge transportation is slow-moving, which can
complicate scheduling. Waterway freezeups during winter months can be a
problem, as can drought conditions when they become severe enough to
threaten water levels. The crippling drought in the Midwest in 1990 is a
good example.
   With the anticipated surge in coal traffic--expected to reach more than
180-million tons by the mid-1990s--a need exists now for larger fleets,
bigger-capacity barges, and continued maintenance and construction
improvements on the inland waterway system.

Trucks, overland conveyors
   These modes of transportation are used primarily for coal deliveries to
plants near coal mines, although coal for small industrial boilers are
often supplied by trucks covering greater distances. Overland conveyors
commonly move coal up to 15 miles from mine to plant, or from mine to
storage or transportation facilities. Longer distances are feasible but may
not be economical compared to truck hauls or short-haul rail transport.
Aerial tramways are sometimes used instead of conveyors to cover relatively
short distances.
   Deliveries by truck account for about 13% of the total amount of coal
shipped annually. Three-axle dump trucks hold about 20 tons of coal,
tractor/trailers up to 35 tons. The maximum load a truck can carry on
highways is limited by state regulations. Trucks sometimes see service for
hauling coal on the spot market; that is, when plants are able to buy
relatively small amounts of desirable coal from distant suppliers.
Normally, however, they cannot compete against rail or barge
transportation.

SITE UNLOADING

Once the coal shipment reaches the unloading area at the plant, equipment
tailored for this function comes into play.

Railcar unloading
   Here, the unloading system is designed to accommodate the specific type
of hopper car that delivers the coal: (1) conventional bottom-dump hopper
car with multiple doors, (2) rapid-discharge bottom-dump type where
virtually the entire car bottom is opened for quick unloading, and (3) a
top-dump gondola car that is unloaded by a rotary-car dumper (Figure 3).
   The first design is intended for small users. Designs two and three are
intended for larger coal-fired powerplants that require unit-train
delivery. Unloading with the rapid-discharge bottom-dump type is usually
performed while the train is in motion. When cars pass over the unloading
area (a long underground hopper or an elevated trestle), car doors are
automatically opened and closed. Speed is the advantage here; a 110-car
unit train can be dumped in 40 minutes--an unloading rate of 16,500
tons/hr. This can be attractive for short hauls (less than roughly 500
miles).
   At most utilities, rotary dumping is the preferred unloading method,
mainly because it offers better control of fugitive-dust emissions--always
a problem with low-sulfur coals. Major components of a rotary-car dumper
include the large circular end rings that support the rails on which the
dumper turns, and the platen, which carries the track rail. Each end ring
rotates on a set of trunions consisting of four or eight crane wheels. The
dumper is rotated by a gear reduction drive through a rack-and-pinion
arrangement or a chain. The unloading rate is typically 3500 tons/hr.
   Ironically, when hauling low-sulfur western coals, unloading equipment
is subject to little, if any, redesign. This is because train speeds and
sizes remain essentially the same. A rotary-car dumper, for example,
unloads whatever kind of coal arrives at the unloading area. A larger
shipment of western coal may take a little longer, but dumper retrofit
isn't necessary.

Barge unloading
   Primary types of barge unloaders are: (1) clamshell-bucket type, in
which a bucket is suspended from a set of hoisting cables and opened/closed
by a set of control cables; and (2) the bucket-ladder type, in which a
series of buckets are supported between two strands of roller chain running
in a loop. In the latter, the buckets are filled by being dragged through
the coal in the barge and emptied as they pass over a discharge sprocket
(Figure 4).
   Since significant barging of low-sulfur western coals is not
anticipated, unloading is not affected. Bucket redesign might be necessary
if western coals were to be barged, however, to accommodate the dustier,
subbituminous material. Low-sulfur eastern coals pose no special
challenge.
   Another type of unloader, called the Siwertell screw-type unloader, is
attractive at sites where noise and dust levels can be a problem. Rated at
1000 tons/hr, it consists of three totally enclosed screw conveyors, which
transfer the coal from collier to belt conveyor quietly and dust-free. If
barging of dusty low-sulfur coal increased, this unloader should be
considered.

STOCKOUT, STORAGE

The unloading and stockpiling of coal--both active and reserve--are closely
related, since the continuous unloading operations require the simultaneous
withdrawal and conveying of coal from the unloading point to the plant
storage areas. Conveying rates of coal to storage must correspond with the
maximum unloading rates, so that both operations can be carried out as a
single, continuous process.

Stockout equipment
   Stockout equipment includes a fixed-boom conveyor, radial stacker, or
stacker/reclaimer for, in most cases, stockpiling coal outdoors on the
ground. A fixed-boom conveyor is a stationary inclined conveyor with the
end cantilevered to allow the formation of a conical pile beneath the
conveyor discharge. Similar to this is a radial stacker, except the
conveyor can rotate horizontally in a semicircle to form a kidney-shaped
pile. Linear stackers and stacker/reclaimers (Figure 5) are rail-mounted
machines served by a conveyor that feeds coal to the machine (stockout) or
traveling tripper that delivers coal to the machine (reclaim).

Storage piles
   Active coal storage is the reclaiming of coal for combustion that has
been stored for a relatively short period of time, usually one week or less
(Figure 6). Coal from an active pile is normally reclaimed without
resorting to mobile equipment. The amount of coal stored in an active
coal-storage pile is usually a three-day supply at maximum burn rate.
   Reserve storage is a long-term storage pile for supplying coal to the
powerplant on an emergency basis in the event of an interruption of coal
shipments. Capacity of the reserve pile is a minimum 60-day supply at 75%
of the maximum burn rate. Coal in the reserve pile is compacted. Because of
its dusty qualities, low-sulfur coal requires special treatment in both
active and reserve storage. It must be wetted down or sprayed with
chemicals to prevent undue losses from fugitive-dust emissions. Also, FCAs
have been formulated for stockpiled coal applications.

Enclosed storage
   Enclosed storage of the active pile includes silos and storage barns.
The storage silo encloses a vertical concrete-cylinder coal-pile
configuration usually 70 ft in diameter (Figure 6). The pile is formed
within the silo by means of an overhead conveyor discharging at the center
of the silo. Reclaiming is via a belt conveyor--normally loaded by
vibrating feeders--at the silo's bottom.
   An inverted-V-shaped storage barn encloses a long, straight coal pile.
The pile is formed within the barn by means of an overhead conveyor with a
traveling tripper or a reversible shuttle conveyor. A belt conveyor in a
concrete tunnel below the coal pile does the reclaiming. It emerges from
below-ground outside of the storage barn and conveys the reclaimed coal to
the desired location.
   In the foregoing stackout/storage activities, handling of low-sulfur
coal will require some equipment redesign. Equipment must be larger to
handle the larger quantities of low-sulfur coal, and must also be speeded
up.

COAL RECLAIMING

In general, coal reclaiming systems may be classified as either below- or
above- grade, depending on whether the coal is removed from the bottom or
top of the storage pile. The tunnel conveyor is the principal form of
below-grade reclaiming and is paired with a variety of feed
systems--vibrating feeders, pile discharges, rotary-plow feeders, and
mobile equipment.
   Above-grade reclaiming systems include the bucket-wheel
stacker/reclaimer and bridge-mounted bucket-wheel reclaimers--the latter
used almost exclusively for bed-blending operations. As shown in Figure 5,
the main components of a stacker/reclaimer are the stacking/reclaiming boom
on which is a reversible-belt conveyor, boom counterweight, bucket wheel,
traveling rail-gantry mechanism with track wheels, and the traveling
tripper. The bucket wheel removes coal off an active storage pile and
discharges it onto the boom conveyor belt. It has a series of buckets
arranged around the circumference of the wheel. The buckets are
scoop-shaped with two open faces--one at the leading edge, for digging; the
other where the bucket is attached to the wheel, for discharge to the boom
conveyor.

COAL CRUSHING, STORAGE

In general, the average size of coal received at large powerplants is
3-in. x 0. The size required by pulverizers feeding large pulverized-coal
(p-c) boilers is 1 1/4-in. x 0. Thus, reclaimed coal must be reduced in
size by crushing before it is transported to the unit silos (Figure 7).
   The crusher most commonly selected to reduce 3-in. x 0 coal to 1 1/4-in.
x 0 coal is the ring granulator.It consists of two end plates mounted on
opposite ends of a drive shaft. Smaller shafts are mounted between these
plates around their periphery. On these shafts are small round cutting
rings that perform the crushing or grinding action. This assembly is
mounted in a steel housing, the bottom of which is a curved grate. As they
rotate, the rings force coal through the grates in the bottom. Grate
spacing is adjustable to compensate for wear.

Bunkers, silos
   After crushing, the coal is conveyed directly to the unit to fill the
bunkers or silos. The bunkers are large-capacity, rectangular-shaped bins
with multiple hopper-type outlets. Because coal tends to hang up on the
slopes and hopper valleys of bunkers, cylindrical concrete or steel silos
with conical outlets are an alternative. The capacity of in-plant silos is
usually 8-10 hours at maximum burn rate (all silos in the plant).
   Although bunkers have a greater capacity, a steady gravitation toward
silos at larger powerplants has occurred in recent years. Key reason: Less
potential for fires and explosions, especially for the low-rank coals
frequently selected today. Steeper bottom-discharge angles in the silo
chutes are being specified to make up for the increased use of poor-flowing
low-rank coals.
   Methods to feed coal bunkers or silos include fixed trippers, traveling
trippers, shuttle conveyors, reversible conveyors, and en-mass chain
conveyors. A primary concern for carbon steel silos and bunkers is metal
loss caused by corrosion and wear. Fortunately, carbon steel can be
protected with a gunite lining.

FEEDERS, CONVEYORS

Feeders deliver coal from a storage area to a point where a conveyor can
handle it conveniently for transport. Of the several different types
(apron, bar-flight, vibrating, etc), the gravimetric feeder is the most
sophisticated. It weighs material on a length of belt defined by two fixed
rollers (span) precisely located in the feeder body (Figure 8). A third
roller supports half the weight on the span. As material passes over the
span, the load cell generates a signal proportional to the weight supported
by the center roller. A microprocessor takes samples of the amplified
outputs of each cell. The samples are converted into binary numbers, which
are compared to parameters stored in memory. If the outputs are within
expected range, each is converted into a signal equivalent to weight per
unit of belt length, then added to obtain total weight per unit of belt
length.
   Friable western coals require special consideration in conveyor-system
design (Figure 9). Field experience has shown that the equipment sized to
handle a given quantity of eastern coal will not handle equivalent
quantities of western coal, even though speed adjustments are made to
compensate for the lower density of these fuels. The reason is that the
higher speeds necessary to provide an equivalent heat-rate input to the
boiler may create a significant fugitive-dust problem when conveying
western coals. Speeds in excess of 550 ft/min are not recommended because
of the high shear velocity along the coal's boundary layer, which has a
wind-blown effect on fines. Athough expensive, enclosed conveyors are a
solution.

COAL PREPARATION

In p-c firing, coal preparation consists of reducing the incoming stream of
coal to powder in a pulverizer (Figure 10), so that it will burn more
efficiently. Key pulverizing methods are these, which differ on the basis
of their drying, feeding, and transport characteristics (also see box, p
28):
   --Storage or bin-and-feeder. Coal is pulverized and conveyed by air or
gas to a collector, where the carrying medium is separated and coal is
transferred to a storage bin and then fed to the furnace, as required.
   --Direct-fired. The most common arrangement for new units, coal is
pulverized and transported with air (or air-diluted gas) directly to the
furnace. The hot air used is called primary air (PA), which is a portion of
the combustion air.
   --Semi-direct. Coal is pulverized and transported to a cyclone
separator, then the separated coal is supplied directly to the furnace by
the independent PA system.

Pulverizer types
   Basic principals of particle-size reduction with pulverizers (or mills)
are impact, attrition, and/or crushing; speed classifications are low,
medium, and high. Most commonly used pulverizers are the ball-tube,
ring-roll or ball-race, impact or hammer mill, and attrition types. The
first two types are most often selected for coal preparation in
powerplants, although ball-tube mills are not suitable for intermittent
operation and tend to be noisy, requiring noise attenuation.
   With ring-roll or ball-race mills, two general classes are these: (1)
the roller assembly is driven and the ring is stationary, or (2) the roller
assembly is fixed and the ring rotates. Generally, mills are equipped with
self-contained or integral classifiers to regulate the fineness. Exhausters
or PA fans are used for flow of hot air through the mills.

Recent advances
   A new series of coal mills reportedly reduces maintenance cost and
downtime. Features are an independent removable planetary gearbox,
vane-wheel primary classifier, heavy-duty grinding-roller assembly,
grinding-roller tilt-out mechanism, long-wear-life grinding elements,
spring cartridge assembly, and tall top classifier.
   A promising device for fine grinding of coal is a ball mill that grinds
coal from a nominally 3/16-in. topsize to a 10- to 20-micron size range in
a single stage using coarse grinding media. Key features: vertically
oriented, batch operated, intermediate-energy density, stirred bed. The
mill can lead to more efficient operation; also anticipated: reduced cost
of $29/ton vs $51/ton for conventional grinding under comparable
conditions.
   Coal-mill retrofits based on the principles of two-phase flow instead of
the usual air-only approximation are now possible. A computer model, using
fluid-mechanical calculations and physical interpretations of the
interactions between solid particles and a gas, help to identify a region
in the classifier with unstable flow characteristics and recommend hardware
changes that stabilize it. End result: Improved performance of the
p-c-fired boiler.
   A new, low-cost dry-cleaning process for removing pyrites from coal can
be integrated directly into a p-c powerplant, interfacing with existing
coal bunkers, mills, and burners. It uses a room-temperature, fluidized-bed
particle separator to perform the coal purification process.

What about FBC?
   Several large bubbling and circulating fluidized-bed boilers are
operating at utility powerplants. The need for carefully characterizing and
preparing coal for FBC application has only been recognized in the last few
years. It is not unusual to see sizing specifications of 1/16 in. or less
for low-volatile high-ash coals and coal wastes. High moisture content
aggravates existing prep problems. Top size for highly volatile coals may
still be rather liberal, however. To handle moisture-laden coal, extensive
coal blending is one solution. Fuel dryers can also be considered to
alleviate pluggage and combustor instability problems that result when
wetter-than-anticipated coal is fired.

BLENDING, SWITCHING

Coal blending can be achieved at either the mine or at the utility. At the
mine, it is mainly a matter of mixing higher-quality coals with those less
desirable to produce a blend attractive for purchase. At the utility, the
task is more formidable. Typically, coals are received by train or barge
and stocked in separate piles, by type, using an overhead tripper system. A
coal analyzer is installed downstream of the blending point. Each minute,
the analyzer assesses whether or not the mixture is on target; deviations
can quickly be corrected by making an adjustment in the feed rates from the
various stockpiles. The fuel is then blended by rotary-plow feeders below
each coal pile, which places pre-determined amounts of each type of coal on
the same conveyor belts--layered in a reasonably blended mix. Thus, coals
of various qualities from different mines can be combined for subsequent
combustion in a boiler.

Key advantages
   Blending offers these advantages:
   --Yields a uniform fuel possessing better combustion properties than the
individual coals making up the blend.
   --Allows western coals to be burned in boilers that would otherwise be
unable to fire subbituminous coals efficiently.
   --Either alone or with physical coal cleaning, can be a valuable method
for controlling the mineral content of coal.
   --Most important of all, by combining low- and high-sulfur coals, it
helps powerplants meet the new SO subscript 2 emissions limits.
   Blending is just as much a software as a hardware challenge. Coal
suppliers and powerplants can use commercially available software to select
coal sources for blending purposes, evaluate the effects of blending on
overall product quality, determine the amount of each coal type needed to
meet product specifications (sulfur, ash, heating value, etc), and design
the least-cost blend.

Fuel switching
   Switching from high-sulfur coal to a low-sulfur fuel, such as gas, oil,
or coal, represents a key option when developing a compliance strategy to
meet the new SO subscript 2 emissions limits. Remember, however, large
coal-fired utility boilers in service today have been custom-designed for
selected fuels; changing the fuel may have significant impact on the
operation and reliability of not only the boiler but also many of the
auxiliary systems.
   Assuming that the original fuel source is an eastern or midwestern
high-sulfur bituminous coal, fuel-switching alternatives are these: natural
gas, low-sulfur oil, co-firing (usually with gas), low-sulfur coal (either
western or central Appalachian), coal blending. Since the CAA is quite
flexible in how utilities meet emissions limits, the options for fuel
switching are many and diverse among the units and plants in the utility's
system.

PRECOMBUSTION I&C

Instrumentation and control of coal-fired powerplants is becoming
increasingly critical: Emissions limitations, better heat rates, and life
management have imposed this new challenge (see box, p 18). Plantwide
networks for weighing, sampling, and analyzing coal as it flows from mine
to boiler are an integral part of precombustion I&C.

Plantwide networks
   To move data between field devices and control/monitoring systems
requires a hierarchy like this (Figure 11):
   --Field bus to transmit data from field device to control system and
then transmit commands from control system to final control element.
   --High-speed data highway as a means of communications between control
and monitoring subsystems, and control-room interface with the operator.
   --Plant network to extract information from the data highway and
transmit it to management, operational support, and data-archiving
subsystems.
   --Communications gateways to interface between the plant information
network and systems outside the plant proper, such as the utility's energy-
and environmental-management systems, corporate computer network, etc.

Weighing, sampling
   Coal is weighed between bunker and boiler by a scale or feeder. In
stoker firing, scales are used exclusively; in p-c firing, either may be
selected. Typically, coal scales handle between 10 and 40 tons/hr, while
feeders process up to about 100 tons/hr. The gravimetric feeder (see above)
is among the most accurate weighing mechanisms. Also see the modular belt
scale shown in Figure 12, which is controlled by a microcomputer.
   Of the many types of p-c sampling systems, most provide isokinetic
sampling of the full cross-section of the coal pipe between bunker and
feeder. One vendor offers a portable sampler comprising a manual rotatable
probe with collecting cyclone and control box, making it possible to solve
fireside problems caused by coal imbalance between burners and minimize NO
subscript x emissions--as well as to measure mill performance with
accuracy.

Coal analyzers
   Continuous on-line coal analyzers are broadly classified as moisture
meters, ash meters, and elemental analyzers. All of them subject the coal
to energy from the electromagnetic spectrum, then correlate the response to
measure or to infer the coal's constituents and properties. The instruments
differ in accuracy, energy source used to excite the sample, amount of
material that can be sampled, potential analyzer locations, frequency and
difficulty of calibration, and installation costs.
   Moisture meters incorporate infrared- or microwave-energy excitation and
capacitance- or conductance-based measurement techniques. Commercial
instruments generally rely on microwave attenuation or capacitance
measurement because of their higher accuracy. Moisture meters can generally
be mounted directly onto conveyor belts.
   Ash meters are based on gamma-energy excitation to determine the coal's
mean atomic number (Figure 13). Because ash constituents have much higher
atomic numbers than combustible constituents, determining the coal's mean
atomic number provides an indirect measure of the ash content. Depending on
coal properties and other variables, ash meters may or may not require a
sampling system as opposed to direct mounting on coal transport devices.
   Elemental analyzers have a higher degree of measurement capability. They
measure the content of sulfur, carbon, nitrogen, and many other elements
directly. Also, properties such as calorific value, ash fusion temperature,
and fouling and slagging indices can be inferred from the elemental
composition.
   Prompt gamma neutron activation (PGNA) is the heart of elemental
analysis (Figure 14). Coal passing through a chute is irradiated with
neutrons, which are captured by the various nuclei of the elements
comprising coal. The resulting gamma rays emitted by each nucleus are
unique to that nucleus.
   The rays are transformed into photons at the gamma-ray detector
assembly, then converted into electronic signals and processed to reveal
each element's contribution to the spectrum. Elemental analyzers require a
sampling system.
   Systems available commercially may incorporate one of more or the
instruments mentioned above. For example, an elemental analyzer can be
combined with an ash meter, or ash content can be inferred from the
analysis given by a single elemental analyzer. Slurry analyzers are
available to monitor the composition of coal/water mixtures. Most measure
only ash and solids content, but some under development also are capable of
measuring sulfur and iron content.

Coal quality--and NO subscript x
   Virtually all experts concede that, unlike sulfur, it is impractical to
remove nitrogen from coal. But recent investigations underscore the
influence of coal properties on NO subscript x emissions; more
specifically, how coal properties can be manipulated to reduce NO subscript
x formation. Thus, it is critical that the impact of any coal type or
preparation technique on NO subscript x emissions be thoroughly understood
before a change is made to reduce SO subscript 2 emissions.
   Already, it is clear that today's low-NO subscript x burners require
more precise operation if combustion efficiency, CO emissions, bottom-ash
quality, flame stabilization, and other factors are not to be compromised.
Coal properties are likely to influence operation profoundly.

Under investigation
   In light of the improved I&C required to meet the new emissions and
reporting requirements of the CAA, at least one instrument manufacturer is
seeking to provide some answers. Major elements of its exploratory program
include the application of continuous, real-time coal- and flue-gas
analysis equipment (along with advanced control algorithms run by a
minicomputer) that relate coal characteristics to flue-gas parameters. The
goal is to document how true on-line feedforward and feedback control
schemes can be implemented--showing how precombustion control can
contribute significantly to the lowering of flue-gas emissions from
powerplant stacks.
   To test an on-line continuous coal calorimeter from another
manufacturer, the selected PGNA instrument actually burned the coal and
measured heating value directly. Different bituminous coals were tested
from different mines. Sulfur content inthe coal was calculated by measuring
SO subscript 2 concentration in the exhaust gas. Moisture in the sample was
determined by drying the coal and measuring total moisture (as burned) with
an automatic moisture-measurement device.
   Ash content was measured by X-ray fluorescence while coal was moving on
the belt feeder. An on-board computer controlled calorimeter operation and
calculated all air- and coal-mass flows as well as coal sulfur, moisture,
ash, and heating value.
   Key application: determining the proper mix of high- and low-sulfur
coals in coal yards.

COMING: EXPERT SYSTEMS TO PREDICT IMPACT OF COAL QUALITY ON PLANT
OPERATION

With the continuing sophistication of software, expert systems to relate
coal quality to plant performance are becoming increasingly attractive. For
example, under the US Clean Coal Technology Program, DOE and EPRI are
funding development and demonstration of a computer software
program--called the Coal Quality Expert (CQE)--that will predict the impact
of coal quality on powerplant performance and cost, including emissions
control. Already underway, it's a $17.4-million project.
   Integrating more than 20 computer models into a single workstation, CQE
will predict the effects of a particular coal on each facet of power
generation--from mine to stack. To determine the most cost-effective coal
and the least-expensive system to control emissions for a given plant, it
will evaluate a range of options, including various coals (26 are currently
under investigation), available transportation methods, and alternative
emissions-control strategies.
   The expert system will include cost-estimating models for new and
retrofit coal-cleaning processes, power production equipment, and
emissions-control systems. Individual models will be made available as they
are developed. The first of these models, called the Acid Rain Advisor, is
ready for use; over 70 EPRI members have models.
   When CQE is complete in 1994, users will be able to develop the most
economical emissions-control strategies, identify fuel options based on
overall plant economics, and evaluate alternative powerplant engineering
designs.

MICRONIZED-COAL MILLS YIELD PRODUCT 10 TIMES FINER THAN PULVERIZED COAL

Micronized coal (MC) is normally any coal pulverized to a fineness of 80 to
90% less than 325 mesh (43 microns), with an average particle diameter of
15 to 20 microns. By grinding the coal some 10 times finer than
conventional pulverized coal, the effective particle surface area is
greatly increased. As a result, the combustion chemistry speeds up still
more, leading to a reaction that begins to act like a gas or oil flame.
   Because of this reaction, the MC mill's best application is with
existing oil/gas-fired plants. Modifications are minimal--mostly the
addition of the MC mill, coal-storage/handling and ash-cleanout equipment,
and new controls. Boiler-tube modifications aren't necessary. A recent
advance is the simultaneous micronization of limestone and coal in the same
mill, leading to a significant reduction in SO subscript 2 emissions
   Key mill designs are these:
   --Disc and hammer. The mill houses a vertical shaft, four rotating discs
each supporting impact hammers, and a radial fan. As coal, entering at the
top, descends to each disc level, coal-particle sizing is progressively
reduced. The fan creates a downdraft, discharging the micronized coal at
the bottom.
   --Centrifugal-pneumatic. There comminution sets up a turbulent flow of
large and small, fast and slow particles, which impact on each other,
causing attrition and fine pulverization. A centrifugal classifier assures
coal with an optimal particle-size distribution.
   --Fluid energy. In this mill, a hollow, elongated torus has a lower zone
for grinding, an upper for classifying. Fluid (air or steam) enters the
grinding chamber through nozzles at pressures to 250 psig. As the fluid
expands, it picks up speed, reaching supersonic velocities. Crushed coal
enters the grinding chamber, becomes entrained in the rapidly circulating
turbulent flow, and is pulverized by mutual impaction and attrition. The
classifier passes finer particles, sends larger particles back.

SUPPRESSANTS CONTROL DUST IN ALASKAN MINE

An Alaskan coal mine produces 1.5-million tons/yr of ultra-low-sulfur
subbituminous C coal for domestic and export markets. The coal is crushed
in two steps, and then dropped onto a 660-ft-long enclosed belt conveyor,
which moves it to a 7500-ton storage bin. To operate year-round in severe
conditions, the mine had to be innovative in all aspects of the operation,
including dust control.
   Dust is generated at the crushers, transfer points, and loadout. To
improve dust control at these places, a proven method is the use of
chemical dust suppressants that are either water- or hydrocarbon-based.
Chemicals are added to increase the wettability of the coal and to
agglomerate small airborne particles into larger particles.
   After considerable investigation by mine and vendor personnel, the
product selected had a combination of wetting, foaming, and residual agents
to provide highly effective dust suppression--not only at the treatment
point (just upstream of the primary crusher), but throughout the mine
facility.--Martin Marietta Magnesia Specialists Inc.

ON-LINE COAL ANALYZER INSURES SO SUBSCRIPT 2 COMPLIANCE

Newly mandated emissions standards led Ohio Power Co's Muskingum River
plant to blend coal from an existing AEP-owned mine with low-sulfur coal
purchased from an outside supplier. To blend the coals efficiently, an
on-line analyzer was selected to provide constant readings of the sulfur
level in the mine-supplied coal to the plant, helping the utility to avoid
"overblending" large quantities of low-sulfur coal.
   With the analyzer (photograph), the plant was able to comply with the
new emissions standards by purchasing only 7% low-sulfur coal annually
(percent of total) as opposed to an estimated 30% that would be needed
based on traditional statistical blending methods.--Gamma-Metrics.

BARGE UNLOADER MOVES COAL INLAND IN A HURRY

Company was selected to design/erect a barge-unloading and yard-handling
system for Baltimore Gas & Electric Co's Brandon Shores powerplant, where
run-of-mine coal arrives in open-top barges from transloading facilities in
Norfolk, Va. The 1700-ft-long dock accommodates three barges.
   A pivoting-arm continuous bucket unloader is capable of unloading a
7000-ton barge at the rate of 4000 tons/hr onto the 72-in. collecting
conveyor. This conveyor transports the 2 in. x 0 coal to conveyor No. 2,
sending it over the water and inland to transfer building No. 1, 2100 ft
away. The control-cab operator on the barge unloader can then direct the
stream to either conveyor No. 3, which conveys to the existing Wagner
station stockpile, or to main conveyor No. 4, which terminates at transfer
building No. 2.
   From transfer building No. 2, coal can be directed to the inactive
storage pile, or go on to the bucket-wheel stacker/reclaimer serving two
live storage piles.--Roberts & Schaefer Co.

VALVE ISOLATES BURNER/PULVERIZER LINE

The NFPA code states that every burner line must have at least one
isolating valve between pulverizer and burner for pulverized-coal firing.
At Dayton Power & Light Co's 2400-MW Stuart station, the valve is closed to
isolate the pipe from the furnace during maintenance of a pulverizer or a
leaking coal pipe. A leaking pipe can be repaired while the pulverizer
supplies the furnace with coal through the remaining pipes.
   Called a knife gate valve (photograph), it can withstand the
temperatures associated with burner lines (up to 1700F in some cases). The
tight-fitting valve comes in diameters from 4 to 18 in., and can be
manually operated or fitted with an actuator.--Stock Equipment Co.

FAMILY OF DUST SUPPRESSANTS BASED ON RESEARCH, TESTING

The Dust-Buster family of dust-suppressant products is the result of
extensive research and field testing under a range of actual conditions.
Products include surfactants, single-application foams for localized dust
suppression, and single-application foams for continued dust suppression
through downstream operations.
   Since each operation for mining and handling of coal is unique in its
methods and requirements, a comprehensive site survey is conducted to
identify problem areas and to determine specific dust-suppression needs.
Then the company considers where suppression is needed most and which
application technique will provide optimum suppression at lowest cost.
   Company provides a full-service program from equipment design,
installation, and service through on-site performance testing. Equipment is
installed during normal shutdown times, thereby eliminating costly delays.
Personnel remain until all systems are functioning properly.--Martin

RING HAMMERMILL OFFERS DIVERSE SERVICE

The ring hammermill is primarily a coal crusher, but it is not limited to
such service in powerplants. Its rugged construction makes the hammermill
adaptable to the reduction of coal middlings, lignite, gypsum, soft
limestone, chemicals, and other friable materials.
   To minimize wear and avoid generating excessive fines, the machine is
designed to operate at relatively low rotor speeds. Ring hammers provide
maximum wearing surface and eliminate the necessity of manually turning the
hammers. This feature, along with the adjustable cage, reduces maintenance
cost and ensures control of product size throughout the service life of the
crushing elements.
   The mill is available in sizes ranging from 20 up to 3000 tons/hr or
more, making it suitable for small industrial plants or the largest central
stations. If desired, the machine can be furnished with a built-in bypass,
which requires very little extra floor space, no extra headroom, and
practically no extra initial investment.--Allis Mineral Systems, Grinding

PAIR CRUSHER/DRYER WITH FLUIDIZED-BED COMBUSTORS FOR EFFICIENT FUEL
PREPARATION

At this California powerplant, a crusher/dryer is the heart of what is
reportedly the first fuel-preparation system to be integrated with
fluidized-bed combustors. Hot flue gas at a temperature of 1500 to 1700F is
drawn into the machine, where 23%-moisture fuel is simultaneously crushed
and dried to meet the requirements of Combustion Power Co's circulating
fluidized-bed (CFB) boiler at GWF Power Systems' 20-MW powerplant near
Hanford, Calif (schematic). CFB-boiler requirements are 228,000 parts/hr
fines.
   The system features the ability to produce a dry, free-flowing fuel
using the energy available from the combustors for drying, then
close-looping the exhaust gases back to the boiler with no loss in unit
efficiency, while also eliminating a dedicated fabric filter for the drying
process. Because of the low O2 content of the flue gas, crushing and drying
take place in an inert atmosphere. Equipment meets NFPA 69 and 85F
requirements.--Williams Patent Crusher & Pulverizer Co.

SAMPLING WITHIN BIAS-TEST ACCURACY LIMITS

At Ireland's Moneypoint generating station, Clean Sweep sampling systems
were selected to replace nonfunctioning, three-stage falling-stream
systems. The new systems are guaranteed to perform reliably, handling wet
coal without hangups and providing sampling results within specified
bias-test accuracy limits.
   The automated belt-sampling system has (1) a primary sampler, which
mounts on the conveyor truss or stringers; and (2) a secondary module,
which is at ground level alongside the conveyor. Crushed coal is sampled
from both stopped and moving belts. A "contoured support" assures correct
belt height, which also corrects for sags and valleys.
   At Moneypoint, all Clean Sweep systems are equipped with mechanical
intermediate sampling to recover uncrushed samples without stopping the
primary belt. Also, all systems have crushers capable of single-stage
reduction to 1/8 in. x 0 size. Commissioning was completed in October 1990.
The systems have been successfully bias-tested and in continuous service
since installation.

PULVERIZER UPGRADES BOOST PERFORMANCE

A Midwest utility experienced problems with its six 1975 coal pulverizers.
Mechanical failures led to frequent downtime, resulting in substantial loss
of unit availability. The company made an evaluation and installed six new
mills, one at a time (photograph), allowing the steam generator to remain
on line. Each pulverizer was subassembled into major sections, offering
quick installation. Pulverizerreliability and availability have improved
dramatically, while maintenance costs have plunged.
   In some retrofits, noncompany mills have been upgraded by re-using as
much as 30% of the existing components and installing company internals in
custom-engineered, modified housings. Improved performance, reduced capital
and maintenance costs were the result.--Babcock & Wilcox Co.

MILL EFFICIENTLY GRINDS WET OR DRY COAL FINES

This vertical-type mill can be a continuous or batch-type stirred-media
machine that can efficiently grind wet or dry coal fines. Grinding media
such as steel balls, ceramic or natural pebbles, or other material is
stirred by an overhung double-helix screw (or charge agitator) in an
open-circuit configuration. Material to be ground is fed in at the top
along with mill water. A continuous upward flow of slurry is maintained by
an external recycle pump. Small feed particles rise and large particles
fall to the media charge, where they are drawn into the media for
grinding.
   Media rises within the screw flights and falls downward in the annular
space between the flight tips and the inside diameters of the mill body.
With steel balls as media, typical media depth is 6 to 8 ft. During
operation, the lower portion of the mill body is packed with media except
for a small space directly below the screw flights. Pulp overflows from the
mill body into an integral classifier. The overflow is either product or
feed for subsequent classification. Underflow is recycled.--Allis Mineral

TWO-PASS RO EASES DEMINERALIZER REGENERATION BURDEN
Membrane applications to makeup-water treatment continue to expand. Redesign
of a utility pretreatment system, described here, introduced many
improvements, not least among which was a major reduction in chemical costs

By:
Compiled by Sheldon D Strauss


Ion-exchange (IX) demineralization is a common, effective method used for
supplying makeup water for steam production. As one utility learned,
however, system modification as a result of open-minded analysis can lead
to product improvement and reduction of operating cost.
   The utility is TU Electric, and the case in point is the Stryker Creek
generating station. As described at the recent International Water
Conference, the opportunity for improvement arose when deterioration of the
treatment system reached a point where reliability, maintenance costs, and
availability of replacement parts became a source of major concern. Several
other factors compounded the problem: limited availability and rising cost
of sodium hydroxide, and the impact of IX waste discharges on the
environment. The need for reduced silica input to the station's two
high-pressure boilers was another consideration.(Reference 1)
   These problems were resolved by substituting membrane treatment for the
cation/anion resin-bed combination used to pretreat makeup water for the
station's mixed-bed demineralizer. In almost a year of operation, it has
provided a better influent for polishing, reducing the frequency of
mixed-bed regeneration. Although the product flow is less, this has been
more than compensated for by an increase in the pretreatment duty cycle.
   The treatment system initially consisted of greensand filters,
strong-acid cation and strong-base anionIX units, and a mixed-resin bed; a
degasifier following the cation unit provided for CO subscript 2 removal.
Operating to a 100-micro-S/cm endpoint, the two-bed (cation/anion) section
provided water quality typically in the range 10 to 80 micro-S/cm. The
mixed bed was operated to an endpoint of 1 micro-S/cm or 10 ppb silica,
concentration of the latter ranging from 10 to 20 ppb SiO subscript 2
during service runs.
   Several options, all involving membrane treatment with reverse osmosis
(RO) in various configurations, were proposed when the need for improvement
became apparent. To process raw makeup with 400 mg/L dissolved solids,
several membrane types were considered, including "seawater" polyamide
membranes because of their 99.5% salt-rejection capability.(Reference 2)
Other choices were between single-pass and two-pass RO systems and possible
elimination of the cation/anion-bed combination as opposed to rebedding.
   Compared to a single-pass RO with two new cation/anion trains, a
single-train system with two RO passes offered advantages with respect to
both capital and operating costs; service runs of the mixed bed with a
single-pass seawater RO array, moreover, was not judged to be satisfactory.
The cost premium for using seawater elements in the first pass of a
two-pass unit was not justified, on the basis of salt passage relative to
brackish-water elements.
   These considerations led to the configuration of choice: A two-pass,
single-train RO featuring thin-film composite (TFC) polyamide membranes.
The dominant factor in this decision was the chemical consumption in
operating the original treatment system--over 462,000 lb of sulfuric acid
and 274,000 lb of sodium hydroxide in more than 600 regenerations of the
cation and anion beds each year. Substitution of the membrane units was
projected to reduce IX-bed regenerations by 98% overall.
   The new system retains greensand filtration and degasification in the
pretreatment section. New greensand media is used, and permanganate is
added continuously to reduce the iron content of the feed; sodium bisulfite
is fed downstream to remove residual free permanganate for protection of
the thin membranes from oxidation (Figure 1). Sulfuric acid injection
reduces influent pH to 4.5, converting the initial 130-ppm bicarbonate
alkalinity to CO subscript 2 for reduction (to about 10 ppm) by the
decarbonator. Subsequent pH elevation to 8.3 by caustic addition further
reduces CO subscript 2 pass-through and improves membrane rejection
capability.
   Cartridge filters provide 5-micron filtration of solids, followed by
injection of antiscalant/dispersant for additional protection of the
membrane system. Under a 500-psi pressure differential supplied by a
multistage centifugal pump, makeup flows in sequence to the two passes,
each of which comprises two stages. Each of the membrane pressure vessels
contains six FilmTec Corp (Minneapolis, Minn) type BW30-840 membrane
elements (Figure 2). Because the second-pass reject is of high quality, it
is returned to the first-pass feed stream. First-pass reject is normally
discharged, but held for neutralization if pH is excessive. The membrane
system has averaged 75% recovery.
   The system modification and quality improvement of treated makeup
account for 96% reduction in the cost of chemicals (over $2/1000 gal of
product water), more than offsetting the added cost to operate and maintain
the system membranes, pumps, membranes, filters, etc (about $1.7/1000 gal
to date, and projected at $1.3/1000 gal). Indicative of the water-quality
improvement is the 1.2-micro-S/cm conductivity and 3-ppb silica leakage
(average values) of the two-pass RO vs 30 micro-S and 15 ppb, respectively,
for the two-bed ion exchangers.
   Resulting improvement of the final product has been the reduction of
conductivity from 0.5 to 0.08 micro-S/cm and silica from 5-10 ppb down to
bare detectability. As added benefits, the modification has obviated the
need for new bulk chemical storage tanks, reduced labor costs dramatically,
and has reduced the accident potential inhandling of regenerant.

UTILITIES CONTEND WITH COPPER TO ENHANCE CYCLE RELIABILITY
Remedies for corrosion and fouling include replacement of copper-bearing
components, improvement of condensate polishing procedures, intensive
chemistry monitoring

By:
Sheldon D Strauss, Senior Editor


The advantages of copper for heat transfer in steam generating systems are
indisputable. At the same time, corrosion of copper and copper alloys
present in condensers, feedwater heaters, etc can impact heavily on other
system components. Evidence of the problem in steam and cooling cycles is
described repeatedly in the literature and at technical meetings, and
remedial steps range from eliminating the source to removal of deposit
accumulations.
   Copper-related problems in various forms have been encountered at many
nuclear and fossil-fueled installations. Both reactor coolant and
secondary-cycle water are involved at nuclear stations. In BWR
(boiling-water reactor) plants, copper has impacted on recirc-piping
corrosion control--through interference with hydrogen water chemistry
(HWC)--and on fuel-rod integrity. Crud-induced localized corrosion (CILC)
of fuel rods results from interaction between a tenacious scale (mostly
copper-rich oxide crud) and nodular zirconium oxide deposits formed on
cladding surfaces. Ensuing thermal stresses, cracking of the oxide layer,
and spalling results in formation of pits, which can penetrate the cladding
if not arrested.
   Identified with plants having copper-alloy condenser tubing and using
filter/demineralizers for condensate cleanup, the phenomenon was reported
in 1985 to have affected 12-15% of operating BWRs.(Reference 1) While some
utilities have replaced copper-alloy condenser tubing with titanium or
stainless steel, remedies sought by others--or applied for further
performance improvement--include tightened control over the production of
Zircaloy tubing and control of copper transport to the reactor. Modified
layup and startup procedures and improved water-chemistry monitoring have
been helpful, but the area receiving greatest emphasis has been treatment
of condensate returns for removal of ionic and particulate matter.
   Considerable attention has been given to improving the design and
operation of condensate filter/demineralizers (CFDs), which incorporate
powdered ion-exchange resins for both purposes (as opposed to separate
filters and deep resin beds). Approaches taken have focused on modification
of both precoat septa and CFD vessel designs, and on improvement of the
precoating technique.(Reference 2) The latter includes use of inert fiber
in the precoat mixture, protective cellulose fiber overlays, and
bodyfeeding of precoat mixtures during service runs. These methods have
proven successful for Georgia Power Co at Plant Hatch, Philadelphia
Electric Co (Limerick and Peach Bottom), and others, with reactor-feedwater
copper levels reported in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 ppb together with
lengthened service runs.
   Step precoating, a variant on bodyfeeding, is a procedure applied at
Vermont Yankee because of deteriorating polisher performance at summer
water temperatures. To improve performance, especially for copper removal,
the utility has been using one or more step-precoat operations involving
the addition of powdered resin, fiber, and resin-fiber mixtures to
individual vessels over short periods of time with the vessels in service.
As shown in Figure 1, step precoating after 10 days has been extremely
effective.(Reference 3) On the average, use of this method has reduced
influent copper from about 4 ppb to less than 0.7 ppb, and extended summer
service runs to 20 days.
   A novel variation on this technique makes use of Ionex cation
fiber(Toray Co, Tokyo, Japan), which has excellent crud-removal properties.
Applied together with the standard coating mixture (Ecodex P-202H, Graver
Co, Union, NJ) in a second step precoat, it has been effective in removing
90% of the undissolved copper present in the condensate. Note that other
techniques are being followed for improved copper removal--unprecoated
elements, backflushable filters, and hollow-fiber filtration for
particulate matter, deep-bed vessels for dissolved copper. Limerick station
is in the process of adding the latter to supplement its CDF for two
purposes: protection from condenser inleakage, and copper reduction to 0.5
ppb.(Reference 4)
   At PWR (pressurized-water reactor) plants, corrosion problems are
centered in steam generators and take several forms: pitting under sludge
piles, denting at tube supports, and intergranular-attack/stress-corrosion
cracking (IGA-SCC). Representative of PWR experience is the history at
Northeast Utilities' Millstone Unit 2, where tube denting occurred after
the first year of operation, pitting after six years, and IGA-SCC four to
six years later (1986).
   Copper has been implicated to some degree in each of these problems,
leading to major steps by the utility to eliminate it. These include
replacement of 70/30 copper/nickel (Cu/Ni) tubing in condensers with
titanium, and in feedwater heaters and moisture separator with stainless
steel. The heater-drains cooler, the only copper-bearing component
remaining in service, will be retubed during a scheduled steam-generator
replacement outage in 1992.
   Steps are also being initiated to remove copper that has plated out on
secondary-cycle piping surfaces during the life of the plant. The preferred
approach is elevation of secondary-system pH to at least 9.6 during
operation by increasing ammonia additions. Recirculation of a high-pH
solution (ammonia plus air) during the outage is another possibility, with
the use of a more effective amine (such as di-aminoethane) for copper
dissolution as an alternative.(Reference 5) A similar procedure, described
as an elevated pH rinse, was applied to Consumers Power Co's Palisades
station to remove residual copper from the hotwell and feedwater piping
preparatory to installing new steam generators.(Reference 6)
   Fossil-fueled plants. Recognizing the sensitivity of high-pressure
cycles to copper, industry chemical guidelines limit its content in
feedwater to 2 ppb.(Reference 7) In cycles containing copper-bearing
components or lacking adequate condensate polishing, the degree of
corrosion-product transport and deposition in piping, boilers, and the
afterboiler circuit can be surprising. Attesting to this is recent
experience at Laramie River station, operated by Basin Electric Power
Cooperative.(Reference 8) The cycle is replete with copper--Admiralty brass
and 90/10 Cu/Ni in the condensers and low-pressure (l-p) feedwater heaters,
70/30 Cu/Ni tubing in the high-pressure (h-p) heaters. Affected areas
included the station's 2400-psig boilers, high-pressure turbines and f-w
heaters, pumps, valves, etc.
   Boiler-waterwall leaks that began in 1989 caused particular concern.
Examination of a section cut from a leaker in Unit 3 early in 1990 revealed
a deep pit adjacent to thick copper-colored deposits (Figure 2); analysis
indicated under-deposit caustic gouging. Subsequent visual examination of
Unit 2 revealed tiny copper particles uniformly scattered over almost the
entire surface of every tube inspected--probably typical of all three
units. It was decided to chemically clean Unit 2, and to make several
operational changes to minimize further damage from copper deposits:
increase condensate pH from 8.6-8.7 to 8.8-9.2, blanket h-p heaters with
nitrogen during outages, and shorten run lengths for deep-bed condensate
polishers.
   As a prelude to cleaning, deposit densities were determined by
energy-dispersive X-ray analysis to range from 13 to 28 g/ft superscript 2,
with copper and copper oxides constituting 61 to 80% of the total (and iron
oxide 12-14%). Screening tests indicated thata two-stage cleaning
consisting of ammoniacal oxygen solvent followed by EDTA for iron oxide
removal would effectively clean and passivate tube surfaces.
   Cleaning began by filling the boiler with demineralized water at pH
about 9 to the normal operating level. After the primary superheater was
backfilled through the attemperator sprays, the boiler was heated slowly to
about 150F, with draining to keep the swelled volume from rising above
normal drum level. Water was then drained to make room for the ammonium
hydroxide and ammonium bicarbonate solutions; these were pumped to the
boiler, and circulated through the economizer and boiler. When
concentrations appeared uniform, O subscript 2 gas was injected through the
downcomer drains while circulation (at about 150F) was continued.
   After some eight hours, with dissolution apparently complete, the boiler
was drained hot and rinsed with demineralized water through the superheater
attemperator sprays, overflowing through the drum down to the pump suction
and pumped to waste tanks. The boiler was then refilled with hot demin
water and rinsed until copper and ammonia levels allowed for discharge to
the station ponds. Next, boiler and economizer were filled again with demin
water, heated, the expansion drained, and an EDTA solution circulated with
temperature held at 275F maximum. The solvent was cooled to 150F when iron
dissolution was complete.
   The last stage, passivation and dissolution of residual copper with
gaseous O subscript 2 admitted to the downcomer drains, was completed
within 45 minutes--an important point, because boiler-tube steel can
corrode rapidly in the process.
   An astounding amount of copper was removed from the station economizers
and boilers, ranging from 2616 lb from Unit 2 to 7508 lb from Unit 1.
Inspection after cleaning showed the drums and headers of all units to be
clean and passive. Waterwall tube sections were coated with 3-4 g/ft
superscript 2 of mixed iron oxides, typical of freshly cleaned and
passivated steel surfaces.
   This experience sharpened understanding of earlier episodes involving
plugging of boiler-feedpump screens (1982-84), turbine copper deposits
(first detected in 1983), and pressure losses across h-p heater tubes
(1984-89), all treated by chemical or physical cleaning. With regard to the
h-p turbines, for example, a need for inspection and cleaning was not
indicated until a capacity-loss trend became evident early in 1990. It was
also noted that Unit 2 did not exhibit a capacity loss; that unit had less
steam attemperation, accounting for lack of copper deposits in the
turbine.
   In sum, the evidence indicates that the 70/30 Cu/Ni is de-nickelizing on
both tube and shell sides of the h-p heaters, and that the copper remaining
flakes off. This would explain the presence of copper in the attemperation
water of Units 1 and 3, and in the water of all three boilers, and
identifies the h-p heaters as the problem source.
   This resulted in two operating changes as a short-term fix: Dumping of
h-p heater drains to the condenser on startup until copper levels drop
significantly, and increasing hydrazine injection at the economizer (to 40
ppb) to encourage production of a less volatile copper form (cuprous
oxide), to minimize carryover to the turbine. A decision has already been
made to retube the h-p feedwater heaters. Additional steps initiated
include extensive monitoring for copper throughout the cycle and location
and elimination of all possible points of air ingress. Injection of
hydrazine scavenger into the crossover pipe between intermediate- and
low-pressure turbines is also under consideration.

CIRC-WATER PIPING REPLACEMENT: GIVE IT THE ATTENTION IT DEMANDS
When a vital piping system runs out of life, there is a chance to rethink
possibilities, reconsider principles, and even to come up with unique
solutions

By:
Ronald D Vering and John A Bugni, Burns & McDonnell
Edited by W O'Keefe

Circ-water piping between condensers and either cooling tower (CT) or other
heat sink is a lifeline for unit operation. Failures occur in these
large-diameter piping systems, of course, requiring repair. The repairs
usually call for little or no engineering effort. After several failures
and repairs, however, the system may become a candidate for replacement. At
this juncture, the situation justifies extensive study and engineering
work. The result is often a decision for replacement.
   Preparing for the retrofit will present several challenges, comprising
the key engineering questions about the proposed project. Look at these
challenges and then at their influence on an actual retrofit operation at a
utility station:
   --Optimizing the pipeline route. Economics require that you keep
operating-facility disruption to a minimum, and considerations concerning
space for plant operation and future expansion are three factors here.
Changes in the plant or additions to structures and equipment since the
original circ-water piping went in may influence planning, and the vertical
dimension of route is important, as well. Decision may be for an
above-ground or a below-grade installation.
   --Optimizing piping configuration. After route selection, the
configuration or layout of the piping calls for attention. An above-ground
line is quite different from a below-grade one, as one example of the
considerations. The configuration must suit site-specific conditions and
plant-operation philosophy. At this stage, primary objectives may be
reduction in disruption of plant operations and limitation of generation
downtime. Give thought, too, to how much of the retrofit lines the plant
can install without interrupting the existing circ-water lines.
   --Accommodating thermal expansion. Conventional longitudinal expansion
joints and anchors are available. Flexible couplings are also worth
considering.
   --Reducing pipe-support costs. These components of the system allow
thermal movement and relieve beam bending stress in the pipe. They also
must prevent excessive pipe movement. Pipe-support costs can be an
important factor in installation cost for the retrofit system and deserve
engineering attention.
   --Retrofitting with minimal downtime. If generation is not to be lost,
pipe installation needs care. Should an outage for installation be long,
then perhaps the plant can wait for a fairly long outage for other
repairs.

Retrofit follows precepts
   The city of Lakeland's 333-MW McIntosh Unit 3 was equipped with
7-ft-diameter circ-water pipes between condenser and cooling tower. After
several failures had occurred in the below-grade system, the Florida
utility's engineers decided to replace the lines. The study followed the
principles outlined above, and both engineering and installation faced
several unique situations.
   Optimizing the route in this case came down to a choice between two
possibilities. One was a repeat of the original below-grade choice,
following an existing secondary road in the plant. The other was an
above-ground installation through an open space in the plant's 230-kV
switchyard.
   Decision was for the above-ground configuration. Figure 1 pictures the
piping and the switchyard during construction. The decision was a difficult
one. From a plant-operation standpoint, a below-grade installation was
preferable, as even casual study of Figure 2 makes clear. Nevertheless,
going below the surface would call for extensive trench shoring to protect
existing structures and for dewatering, because of a high groundwater
table. In addition, a below-grade installation would have needed trench
depths to 15 ft in some areas to clear existing electrical duct banks.
   Because of the cost impact of these site-related installation
conditions, the above-ground configuration won out. The projected cost
saving of the above-ground over the below-grade installation was about
$3.5-million.
   Pipe-material cost was an important component of total project cost, and
therefore required evaluation during the route-selection process. Concrete,
fiberglass, and steel were the possibilities, judged on a comparable basis
that considered strength, corrosion resistance, and maintenance. Decision
would have been for concrete as most economical for a below-grade
installation. Steel was the choice for the selected above-ground system.
   Running the lines above-ground posed many unique challenges. The
configuration finally chosen, however, allowed installation of most of the
pipeline without upsetting the old circ-water system. The amount of pipe
awaiting installation during a Unit-3 outage finally amounted to only that
for tie-in at the condenser, the circulating-water pumps, and the cooling
tower, plus some pipe under a 69-kV electrical bus and a 230-kV transfer
switch in the switchyard area.
   Figure 2 outlines major considerations affecting piping configuration
and details four of the most critical design areas. It gives the choices of
routes and makes clear the pipe stretches installed during unit outage.
   Maximum access and laydown space in the area between Unit 1 and Unit 3
resulted from the stacked pipe arrangement along the west side of Unit 3
(Figure 3). Jointing of the pipe in this area, by couplings and flanges,
makes possible the dismantlement of the pipe and thereby the accommodation
of future removal of such major equipment as Unit-3 transformers. Eyes
welded at the tops of pipe spools help in this.
   The crossing (Figure 4) under both the existing 230-kV switch structure,
which transfers Unit-3 generated power to the switchyard, and the 69-kV tie
bus connecting the switchyard for Units 1 and 2 to the Unit-3 switchyard,
demanded special consideration. Clearance needs mandated raising of both
structures.
   Pipeline clearance from overhead power lines throughout the plant site,
as well as electrical bus inside the switchyard, was another concern. The
design met fault-current potential considerations by grounding the pipeline
at approximately 40-ft increments, at each pipe joint.
   Reaching the cooling tower required crossing the main plant-entrance
road. Partial burying of the pipes in this area reduced installation costs.
Although setting the bottom of the pipe about 4 ft below existing grade
eliminated need for extensive shoring and dewatering here, the concept made
necessary an adjustment to the existing road's profile to accommodate the
3-ft abovegrade projection of the 7-ft-diameter pipe, plus 30 in. of fill
over the pipes.
   Existing facilities near the road crossing further complicated road
revisions. Nevertheless, the completed change of road grade added minimal
cost without impairing existing facility access.
   At the CT, setting the replacement pipe header outside the existing CT
pipes (Figure 5) allowed installation of the new CT header during operation
of the old pipeline. In addition, maintenance cranes placed either outside
the new CT header or in the alleyway left between the new header and the CT
can remove CT equipment or work on the circ-water pumps.
   Thermal expansion of piping can make longitudinal-expansion elements and
anchors necessary, but these devices would have cost too much for the
McIntosh project. Anchoring the 7-ft above-ground pipe against its possible
470-kip internal-pressure thrust load combined with a possible 150-kip
friction load resulting from pipe movement would have been expensive. The
required route included five bend points, raising costs even higher.
   Part of the solution was to allow the pipe to move near bend points,
which eliminated need for anchors. Pipe geometry still had to be flexible
enough to give the needed thermal-stress relief, however, and there were
several locations where the geometry fell short. Inserting a set of
flexible couplings at pipe joints at these locations gave flexibility at
low cost. The couplings relieve pipe thermal stress by functioning as
hinges that allow point rotation at consecutive pipe joints. Another
purpose for flexible couplings was reduction of loads on connections to
existing equipment and piping.
   Flexible couplings for pipe-stress relief make necessary joint
harness-rod assemblies to transmit the pipe-pressure thrust force across
the couplings. Conventional multi-bolt tie-rod assemblies restrict free
rotation at the coupling, however, so the arrangement of Figure 6, with
only two bolts, one on each side of the plane of joint rotation, was
preferred. There is free hinge rotation at the coupling. The specially
designed ring-girder stiffeners in the figure are necessary to prevent
local pipe buckling in the vicinity of the harness-rod attachment.
   Four regions of interest from the thermal-expansion standpoint are
highlighted in Figure 2. Near the circ-water pumps, a tee branch instead of
a wye gives a better distribution of thermal loads on the pump connections.
At the west end of the cooling tower, an expansion loop in the connection
to the CT blowdown line reduces thermal loads on the blowdown-line
connection.
   Pipe-support costs were a key factor in installation costs. To keep
costs to a minimum, designers chose three types of supports, each intended
to accommodate pipe thermal movement and relieve beam bending stress in the
pipe.
   One type exploited the ring girders already employed at the
flexible-coupling harness assemblies, adding steel-plate support-leg
attachments welded to the girder (Figure 6). Another type, for the vicinity
of pipeline bend points, was a steel saddle welded to the pipe's haunch
area.
   The base plates for both of these support types have slide surfaces with
tetrafluoro-ethylene on both faces to permit pipe movement in all
directions. Guides prevent excessive movement.
   The third type of support, the concrete cradle, is in the straight runs
of pipe, where longitudinal movement is the sole concern.
Graphite-impregnated felt between pipe and concrete cradle eases pipe
movement on the support surface.
   To reduce costs, the pipe-support foundation system received shallow
spread footings except where loads were excessive. Where pipe loads
transmitted large moments into the foundation, pile foundations became
necessary. Only two locations required them: the stacked pipe arrangement
at the condenser and the riser pipes at the cooling tower.
   It was important in the Lakeland replacement project to minimize loss of
generation during pipe installation. The final design configuration allowed
installing most of the pipe while Unit 3 was operating. The estimate of
outage time for tie-in of that pipe was four to six weeks, assuming
double-shift work and separate crews for the condenser, switchyard,
circ-water-pump, and CT areas.
   Tie-in was set for a planned annual unit outage, but the outage duration
had to be extended beyond the normal period to allow the tie-in. For better
maintenance-time utilization during the longer-than-normal outage, Lakeland
scheduled a turbine overhaul to coincide with the tie-in.
   A single crew, working a normal 40-hr work week during a four-month
period, put in the 2220 ft of pipe scheduled for pre-outage installation.
The pipe to be installed during the outage required four weeks, with
double-shift work for the first outage week and then three weeks of single
12-hr shifts.
   During the outage, four separate crews worked in the four areas
mentioned above. Curing the coating on the pipe's field-welded closure
joints and filling and hydrotesting took about a week.
   There were no significant problems during hydrotest and return to
service of the circ-water line. Weld inspection and testing of individual
joints, done during installation of the pipe, contributed to the freedom
from trouble in the hydro test. Minor leakage occurred at one 7-ft and
several 24-in. flexible couplings, but retightening the coupling bolts to
compress the joint gaskets properly stopped the leakage.
   High vibration occurred on one circ-water pump during startup. The new
pump discharge pipe's stiffness differed from that of the old, aggravating
an inherent pump-column/pipe-system resonant frequency condition. Adding
weight to the top of the vertical circ-water pump's motor lowered the
natural frequency and eliminated the high vibration.
   Data obtained after startup indicates that pipe movement is in the
direction and of the magnitude foreseen by the system design. Long-term
reliability can be expected from the replacement system.

LOOK AT SUCTION SPECIFIC SPEED FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE
Rework of experience-based limits for impeller performance makes the
concept more helpful in practical pump selection

By:
D H Cavi, Sargent & Lundy
Edited by W O'Keefe

It has been said that engineering is a blend of art and science. Hence,
phrases such as "if it looks right, it probably is" were coined.
Centrifugal-pump hydraulic design is a technology that has typified this
blend of art and science in engineering. In the hydraulic-design process,
the impeller is of primary concern. In addition, the pump's casing is
designed to accommodate the performance requirements and characteristics of
the impeller and therefore has a supporting role in the hydraulic-design
process.
   A well-designed impeller is proportioned to accelerate liquid smoothly
and uniformly from point of entry at the impeller eye, through the vane
passages, and on out to the discharge side of the impeller. If the inlet
eye is disproportionately large, the liquid acceleration may not be smooth
and uniform. In consequence, eddies can form within the impeller and cause
hydraulic instability. In severe cases, the eddies cause cavitation-like
erosion of the impeller and the casing near the impeller eye, along with
harmful pressure pulsations and vibrations.
   Certain centrifugal pumps are designed for low required net positive
suction head (NPSH subscript r). These pumps are in industrial, process,
and powerplant services where specified available net positive suction head
(NPSH subscript a) at the pump suction is relatively low. The impellers in
these pumps, typically identified as "large-eye" impellers, have had the
above-described unstable and damaging characteristics when the pumps
operate at flows away from the best-efficiency flow region on the
performance curve.
   Pump-application guidelines that caution the user on potential
limitations for impeller-inlet and -discharge design interrelations are the
focus here. Previously published guidelines, based on specific speed,
developed head, and suction lift (or suction head), can be simplified and
realigned to conform with current industry parameters of suction specific
speed (S subscript s) and specific speed (N subscript s).
   Early researchers recognized that actual performance of centrifugal
pumps deviated from the theoretical. Main causes of the deviations are
natural and inescapable phenomena--such as fluid friction, turbulence,
pre-rotation, and slip. There were no high-confidence analytical means to
compensate for the effects. Consequently, researchers quantified and
correlated the performance deviations with physical design parameters. The
correlations became a basis for design factors to bridge the gap between
theoretical and actual performance. Parameters such as "specific speed" of
an impeller (N subscript s = rpm x gpm superscript 0.5 divided by H
superscript 0.75, based on conditions at the best-efficiency point, BEP, on
the performance curve--see Reference 1) came into use to facilitate
application of design factors to the variety of impeller types that were
and still are widely used. (Note that H is head in feet of liquid.)
   Impeller specific speed N subscript s is an indication of three factors:
the shape of the flow path through the impeller, whether axial, radial, or
mixed-flow; the design proportions of the impeller at the outer (or
discharge) diameter; and the spacing between the shroud and back disc of
the impeller. Specific speed therefore concerns primarily the configuration
of the discharge side of an impeller. Figure 1 makes clear the correlation
between impeller geometry and specific speed.
   The suction capability of a pump was designated as the maximum "suction
lift" that the pump could produce at a specified flow. When this suction
lift was exceeded, the pump was said to have "lost its prime." In real
terms, the pressure at the eye of the impeller had fallen below the vapor
pressure of the liquid, causing the liquid to flash. The resulting vapor
bubbles choked the liquid flow at the impeller eye, so that the flow surged
or completely stalled.
   "Suction lift" was an adequate means of defining suction capability of
an impeller in situations where vapor pressure of the pumped liquid was
low--such as with ambient-temperature water. The concept is not adequate,
however, when vapor pressure approaches suction pressure. To account for
vapor pressure of the liquid, the concept of "net positive suction head"
(total absolute suction head minus vapor pressure of the liquid, in feet of
liquid) was devised (Reference 1).
   NPSH subscript r characteristic of a pump is determined by test. It is a
function of pump-inlet design, impeller-eye diameter, impeller-vane inlet
geometry, and speed. Researchers have found that conditions at the impeller
discharge also affect NPSH subscript r (Reference 2,3). Some pump
manufacturers clearly indicate in published performance curves that
reduction of impeller diameter can increase NPSH subscript r at a
particular flow condition.
   The Hydraulic Institute recognized that a relationship exists between an
impeller's specific speed which, as discussed above, pertains to the
impeller discharge configuration, and suction conditions. Exceeding certain
limits would increase the potential for serious trouble from "vibration,
noise, and pitting."(Reference 4)
   In 1932, the Hydraulic Institute first published charts for "upper
limits of specific speeds," correlating the specific speed of an impeller
with its developed head and either the maximum suction lift that should be
produced or the minimum suction head needed to avoid serious trouble.
   The Hydraulic Institute Standards had four charts, each for a family of
curves applying to double-suction pumps, single-suction shaft-through-eye
pumps, single-suction overhung impeller pumps, and axial and mixed-flow
pumps. Figures 2 and 3 are those for the first- and last-mentioned types.
The last version was in 1975.(Reference 4) They apply to operation at or
near BEP and base on statistics of the Institute reflecting operating
experience in industrial applications.(Reference 5)
   Of late, the concept of suction specific speed S subscript s has come
into use. An impeller's S subscript s derives from pump test data and
relates flow entering the impeller eye to operating speed and NPSH
subscript r at BEP. In a comparison of different pumps or different
impellers for a particular pump, S subscript s is a useful indication of
relative size of the impeller eye. An impeller with higher S subscript s
would require lower NPSH and would typically have a larger inlet eye than
an impeller with lower S subscript s. S subscript s therefore indicates the
inlet configuration of an impeller in the same sense that N subscript s
indicates the impeller discharge configuration.
   The curves in Figures 2 and 3 are for clear water at 85F and sea level.
This establishes vapor pressure and atmospheric pressure, allowing
conversion of lift or suction-head conditions to equivalent NPSH values.
Vapor pressure of water at 85F is 0.6 psia or 1.4 ft, and atmospheric
pressure is 34 ft of water at sea level. NPSH for conditions in Figures 2
and 3 equals 34 - 1.4 + suction head (or - suction lift).
   Additionally, for any point on the curves, there is an N subscript s
value and a corresponding head value. From these, the quantity: rpm x gpm
superscript 0.5 can be calculated from the specific-speed equation. Lift or
suction head conditions are convertible to NPSH, so S subscript s is
calculable for any curve point by dividing rpm x gpm superscript 0.5 by
NPSH subscript r superscript 0.75. For a double-suction impeller, divide
further by (2) superscript 0.5.
   Figure 4 is an example of the conversion of points in Figure 2 to
equivalents relating S subscript s to N subscript s. The family of curves
in Figure 2 reduces to a single curve for the parameters of N subscript s
and S subscript s. For other types of pumps, Figures 5-7 hold, each plotted
similarly from the Hydraulic Institute charts for the particular pump type.
The equivalent "safe" region that corresponds to the upper limit of N
subscript s on the Hydraulic Institute curves would be the area below the
Figure 4-7 curves.
   Admittedly, some pump designs may exceed the limits in the curves. In
such instances, review of test data and operating experience is advisable
to prove capability for the required duty and range of flow.
   Typically, pumps that exceed the limits have a relatively large impeller
eye (in a multistage pump, the first stage). Experience indicates that such
pumps have a comparatively narrow stable operating range, near the BEP.
Operation outside the stable range can result in liquid recirculation at
the impeller eye (eddies), causing high vibration, pitting on the impeller
and adjacent casing areas, and axial shuttling of the shaft. Prolonged
operation this way can lead to bearing and shaft-seal failure, and damage
to impeller and casing.
   The condition may not be a concern if the pump runs only in the
optimum-efficiency flow range or handles viscous liquids. Pumps below the
curve limits generally have a broader stable operating range.
   Conversely, if a pump's S subscript s vs N subscript s characteristic
falls far below the curves, the impeller eye would be comparatively small,
leading to a choking condition at certain flows. Choking can result in low
efficiency, degraded head, inlet cavitation, and recirculation (eddies) at
the impeller discharge.
   The latest edition of the Hydraulic Institute Standards (Reference 1)
does not include curves such as Figures 2 and 3. Instead, an S subscript s
value of 8500 is assumed satisfactory for most applications. The S
subscript s equation is rearranged to solve for rpm, using NPSH, and the
resulting pump speed is the suggested maximum operating speed. For pumps
with constant-speed motor drive, the next lower synchronous speed would
apply.
   Figures 4-7 indicate that a S subscript s of 8500 would be conservative
for some pumps but needs examination for others. The 8500 value is
questionable for impellers with N subscript s from around 2000 up, except
for end-suction single-inlet pumps, where 8500 would be questionable for N
subscript s of 2500 and up.
   For impellers of higher N subscript s design, Figures 4-7 indicate that
S subscript s is lower than 8500. Figure 1 makes clear that high-N
subscript s impellers have relatively small outer diameters. If S subscript
s is high, then the impeller's inlet-eye diameter is large.
   Combination of high S subscript s and high N subscript s for an impeller
indicates a relatively short flowpath between inlet and discharge, causing
an abrupt acceleration of the liquid and adversely affecting hydraulic
stability of the impeller. The slope of the Figure 4-7 curves agrees with
this analysis. According to the Hydraulic Institute standards committee
(Reference 5), impellers of low N subscript s can be designed for high S
subscript s values; this agrees with the trend of Figures 4-6 curves.
   The Hydraulic Institute curves typified by Figures 2 and 3 stemmed from
field operating experience, and the S subscript s/N subscript s curves of
Figures 4-7 have the same basis, because they were calculated directly from
the Hydraulic Institute curves.

KNOW CAUSES OF, SOLUTIONS TO CFB-BOILER REFRACTORY PROBLEMS
Refractories are used extensively in CFB boilers. Because early systems
were prone to failures, advanced refractory systems have been developed and
applied successfully

By:
M S Crowley, Consultant
Edited by Steven Collins

Circulating fluidized-bed (CFB) boilers use extensive amounts of
refractories to withstand harsh operating conditions--including
temperatures topping 2000F, frequent thermal cycling, and continuous attack
by erosive high-velocity particles. Thermal cycling alone, encountered on a
daily basis by many units, can eventually destroy almost any refractory.
Specific areas requiring protective refractories include the combustor,
cyclones, external heat exchanger (EHE), ducts, and transfer lines (Figure
1).
   Correct selection and installation of materials is critical to
minimizing refractory failures. The following material provides valuable
insights into the construction and repair of CFB refractories.

Typical CFB linings
   Refractory selection is complicated by reciprocal physical properties.
Example: Good insulating materials often have poor erosion resistance. To
make up for trade-offs, refractory systems are often made of several
materials applied in layers.
   Three general types of liner designs are used in advanced CFBs:
Waterwall and thin or thick linings for non-waterwall surfaces. Waterwall
linings, used in the combustor and cyclone areas, use short studs to hold
a thin, 1/2-2-in.-thick layer of dense refractory to the flue-gas side of
boiler tube assemblies. Conventional insulation is affixed outside to
maintain high water/steam temperatures. The linings withstand rapid
thermal upsets better than thick lining. Steel fiber is often added to
waterwall liners for toughness and shock resistance.
   Thin linings, typically 6 in. or less in total thickness and usually
have both dense and insulating layers. They are more economical to install
and maintain than thick linings. However, a hotter shell--ranging from 300
to 500F--can make thin-lined components less efficient and uncomfortable to
work around.
   Thick linings usually consist of two or three layers totaling 12-18 in.
A dense, "hot face'' of abrasion-resistant brick, plastic, or castable
protects against the erosive action of hot, high-velocity particles. Backup
layers of insulating material reduce heat loss, decrease shell
temperatures, and improve overall efficiency.

Refractory materials
   Refractories consist of mineral combinations--usually oxides--formed
into rigid shapes with the aid of a binder. They are classified as either
preformed or unformed. Preformed refractory materials--brick and tile--are
fired before installation. Unformed materials--castables and plastics--are
fired after installation to create seamless monoliths. Castables differ
from putty-like plastics in that they must be mixed with water at the work
site.
   Physical properties. To obtain desired physical properties--such as
strength, erosion resistance, and volume stability--refractory
manufacturers blend the appropriate prefired aggregates with suitable
binders. The latter includes raw clay, calcium aluminate cements, or
phosphate-based materials. The important physical properties of brick,
tile, plastic, and castable refractories differ, depending on chemical
composition and manufacturing and installation techniques used (see table).
Thermal stability, a measure of how well a material resists repeated
thermal cycling, is perhaps the most important property for CFB
applications. However, erosion-resistance, hot-strength, creep-resistance,
heat-transfer, and shrinkage characteristics must also be considered for a
given application.
   Clay binders are often added to ceramic oxides before firing when making
brick or tile. With some materials, a ceramic bond can be formed without
the help of binder by firing them at a higher temperature. Otherwise a
material that promotes bonding such as monoaluminum phosphate, may be used
to form a strong bond after firing temperatures reach 1000F.
   Because they are easy to apply and shape, monolithic refractories--both
castables and plastics--are most commonly used. Castables are composed of
calcined mineral aggregates and a calcium-aluminate or hydraulic cement,
along with additives that ease wetting and placement.
   Castables are shipped dry to the site. Water is added in a mixer if the
material is to be cast in a form, or at the gun nozzle if "gunning'' is
used to place the lining (Figure 2). Advanced castables are becoming more
popular because they offer minimal shrinkage and enhanced formability.
   Plastics are similar to castables in formulation. Both use calcined
aggregates and a binder. However, plastics--which are premixed at the
factory--use phosphates or other heat-setting agents to cause the material
to bond or "setup'' when fired. Castables use hydraulic cements which form
the permanent bond when mixed with water and fired.
   Fibers. Stainless steel fibers and organic "burn-out'' fibers are often
added to both plastics and castables. Stainless steel fibers improve
toughness and crack resistance. Organic fibers, which are finer than sewing
thread, melt or burn-out the first time a refractory is fired, leaving a
maze of tiny tunnels behind. These allow steam to escape and reduce the
occurrence of explosive spalling--particularly during the initial firing of
moisture-laden materials. Virtually no detrimental changes in physical
properties result from adding organic fiber.
   The use of ceramic fiber by itself as a refractory material is generally
limited to packing around metal components such as door jams to allow for
thermal expansion. The erosive action of sand, limestone, and ash generally
precludes the use of ceramic fiber in most areas of a CFB boiler.

Installation techniques
   To ensure that a finished castable product comes out as planned, excess
water must be kept to a minimum, manufacturer's curing instructions closely
followed, and anchors correctly positioned. Slow initial drying
periods--where temperaturesare raised at a rate of about 100-deg-F per
hour--are recommended to ensure that a new lining will not explode upon
startup. Anchors should be spaced at intervals equal to two to three times
the thickness of the lining and extend two-thirds to three-quarters of the
way through the refractory.
   A pneumatic rammer is often used to work putty-like plastics and
castables into the desired area (Figure 3). While most plastics are still
installed using rammers, advanced gunning machines are now available that
apply certain plastics by a pneumatic technique that does not require water
addition at the gun nozzle. The new gunning techniques are likely to become
more popular because they are faster, require fewer people to operate, and
allow some of the rebound to be reused rather than thrown away. In
addition, these pneumatically installed materials are said to be stronger,
denser, and longer lasting.
   Vibratory casting, a relatively new placement method, uses vibratory
action to force thick material to flow into forms. Vibratory castables have
special additives which greatly improve flowability, strength, and erosion
resistance without increasing the water content of the mixture. Gunning or
vibratory casting are the installation methods preferred for large areas
while ramming or hand-packing may be acceptable for small or
difficult-to-reach areas.
   Brick and tile are installed with little mortar using a "dip-joint"
technique. The brick is dipped into a pool of gravy-like mortar, then
installed. Only a thin coating of mortar remains on its surface. Joints are
typically 1/16 in. thick or less. This reduces the chances of creep or the
entry of pieces of slag and particulate matter.
   Contractors. The use of third-party inspectors to monitor the
installation and repair of refractories is recommended. Most owners do not
have the necessary in-house expertise to effectively oversee the
installation of advanced refractories. Preliminary testing of both the
materials and the skill-level of installation personnel will go a long way
towards reducing future maintenance costs (Figure 4).
   Refractory testing. When purchasing a refractory, it is important to
request the manufacturer's test results. Most refractory tests are based on
ASTM procedures which can be performed by many independent laboratories
(see Reference 7). Generally, flexural and compressive strengths, thermal
conductivity, erosion and thermal-shock resistance, and thermal expansion
are the main items of concern. Strengths should be measured at expected
operating temperatures to ensure an adequate service life.

Areas of most concern
   The combustion zone in many CFB units reaches temperatures of 1600 to
1800F, is usually oxygen-deficient, and is generally under a slight
positive pressure of 1 to 3 psig. Severe thermal shock and cycling are
common. Combustor temperatures may swing by 1000-deg-F in a few minutes. A
dozen or more startup/shutdown cycles in a week are possible.
   The reducing atmosphere here may call for refractories low in free iron
or iron oxide. Chemically, iron catalyzes the subsequent breakdown of CO
into CO subscript 2 and carbon. This process results in the deposition of
carbon inside refractories, which causes internal expansion and the
gradual destruction of the material.
   In most CFB units, sand, limestone, and ash act as the primary heat
exchange media to combust the coal or other organic matter. If possible,
sand should be removed after startup because it is extremely erosive. Thick
linings, consisting of 3 to 6 in. of dense erosion-resistant castable or
plastic covering a similar thickness of insulating material, frequently
fail by excessive cracking and "pinch-spalling.'' Shrinkage upon drying,
thermal shock, and creep of the hot face under compressive stresses are the
main causes of cracks. Stainless steel fibers help to reduce cracking, but
can not stop it completely. Pinch spalling occurs as bed material becomes
trapped and the lining experiences repeated thermal cycling (Figure 5).
   Phosphate-bonded mullite-based plastics stand up well in combustion-zone
service because of their good volume stability (resistance to thermal
expansion and contraction) in cyclic service and excellent erosion
resistance. These materials can be used to repair defective areas because
the phosphate binder adheres well to existing materials. To ensure that the
patch holds, a minimum of two anchors should be used. Ceramic or cast alloy
anchors are recommended for holding plastic linings exposed to extreme
temperatures. Additional anchors may also be needed to retain the
insulating layer independently.
   In the freeboard area above the combustion zone, silicon carbide (SiC)
tiles have been used to reduce erosion of waterwall tubes. Often, a silicon
carbide mortar is used behind the tile to improve heat transfer to the
tube. The tile is usually held onto the tubes with welded inserts. In
designs where the waterwall tubes extend down to the combustor floor,
linings often include a thin layer of a dense high-thermal-conductivity,
abrasion-resistant plastic or castable.
   Often SiC-based castables are initially specified on studded tubes.
These can be repaired with phosphate-bonded plastics--preferably containing
SiC aggregate for high thermal conductivity. Phosphate-bonded materials are
also recommended if the feedstock or recycle ash is high in alkali content.
Reason: Calcium aluminate cements break down under high-temperature alkali
attack.
   Cyclone inlet and barrel. Combustor roofs and cyclone inlets experience
temperatures of 1000 to 1800F, with occasional excursions above 2000F.
Here, a two-component lining of insulating material covered by a dense
abrasion-resistant layer containing stainless steel fiber has provided
acceptable service life. If severe thermal shock causes excessive cracking,
a fused silica-based castable may be used instead.
   The cyclone barrel and cone experience very severe conditions, including
temperature swings of 1000 deg F within a few minutes, repeated cycling,
and some erosion. For many thick linings, the repeated thermal shock and
cycling coupled with erosion and pinch-spalling have caused large sections
to fail. Poor results with various repair schemes have led some operators
to replace thick castable linings with brick ones made of insulating brick
or block covered with abrasion-resistant mullite brick. Repairs to these
linings can be made with phosphate-bonded plastic.
   Another possibility is to use a thinner lining made from material with a
low coefficient of thermal expansion--such as a fused silica castable.
However, most fused silica castables have low erosion resistance compared
to phosphate-bonded mullite plastics. Thus, service life is shorter.
   The cyclone cone experiences conditions similar to those of the barrel.
However, here the lining rests on the shell. Vibratory casting is
recommended for strength, erosion resistance, and low thermal expansion of
castables placed in the cone.
   Cyclone dipleg and loop seal. This area has been a source of continuing
problems in some units. Thermal shock coupled with severe erosion and
thermal cycling have resulted in repeated failures. Many of the initial
designs employed thick layers of both dense and insulating
castables--difficult materials to install properly, given the area's
confined spaces and limited accessibility. When installing linings,
insulating castable covered by vibration-cast, shock/abrasion-resistant
castable with both stainless-steel and burn-out fibers should be
considered. Erosion-resistant brick with a backup layer of insulating brick
or castable has also worked well. Phosphate-bonded plastic with stainless
steel fibers is typically used to repair existing units.
   External heat exchangers (EHE), used in some CFB designs, often employ
refractory-covered internal division walls to force ash to flow in a
pattern of hair-pin turns over a bed of heat-transfer tubes. Unlike
external walls, division walls are heated on both sides and are not
fastened to a cool shell. Lack of a supporting shell with anchors means the
wall can bend in and out of its original plane under the influence of
thermal stresses. This out-of-plane movement allows large cracks to open up
and trap circulating bed media, which aggravates the bending action (Figure
6).
   Transfer lines. The insides of transfer lines are covered with
refractories that resist erosion and thermal cycling. The most popular
choice consists of vibration-cast material having excellent volume
stability and erosion resistance. Adding stainless steel and organic fibers
is advisable. Phosphate-bonded plastics, preferably with mullite-based
aggregate for volume stability, can be considered for repairs.

Failures and repairs
   Cracks wider than 1/16 in. can trap limestone and ash particles and
eventually cause a lining failure as thermal cycling induces a wedging
action. The loss of thin layers--down to the anchor tips--can often be
tolerated if the lining is not separating from the shell. Fused
silica-based castables and phosphate-bonded plastics are popular
crack-repair materials.
   Spalling. There are two forms of spalling that are likely to occur in
CFB linings. Explosive spalling usually occurs on the initial heat-up of a
new installation when the water present in the castable or plastic is
converted to steam faster than it can escape from the lining. The buildup
of steam pressure exceeds the tensile strength of the material, at which
point the lining explodes. Organic burn-out fibers used in both castables
and plastics can greatly reduce the chance of explosive spalling. Brick
linings are usually not subject to this failure because the bricks are
prefired and moisture in mortar can escape out the joints between adjacent
bricks. Thermal-shock spalling can occur in both brick and monolithic
linings when sudden changes in temperature force the lining to expand or
contract faster than the material can accommodate the stress.
   Repair methods for spalled areas vary. Brick linings should be replaced
with more spall-resistant brick if large areas fail. Small areas can be
repaired using a phosphate-bonded plastic if an adequate number of anchors
can be installed. Monolithic linings are repaired using either
phosphate-bonded plastics--for small areas--or low-thermal-expansion
castables.
   Erosion. In general, erosion values below 10 cm superscript 3--based on
ASTM test C-704--are required for severe erosion service. A better test
runs at operating temperatures using the actual abrading media (Reference
4). Equipment for this test is not yet widely available.
   The best materials for erosion resistance are the new vibration-cast,
low-moisture castables and phosphate-bonded plastics. The erosion value
varies, depending on the material, the placement method, and the percent
water used.
   Anchor failures can be caused by several factors (Figure 7). Faulty
welding, incorrect spacing, poor anchor selection, corrosion, and
overheating are the most common causes. Ceramic and cast alloy anchors are
recommended for plastic linings because of their superior holding power and
resistance to high temperatures. Stainless steel anchors are used for
castable linings because they cost less and have excellent holding power
when properly designed. Welding specifications should be carefully reviewed
to avoid premature failure.
   Ceramic anchors usually extend all the way to the hot face while metal
anchors are held back at least an inch from the hot face. Thus, if an inch
or more of metal anchor is exposed because of erosion or spalling, an
estimate of the amount of lining left can be made. A decision on whether or
not to reline is then made based on the desired run time until the next
major shutdown.

STOKERS KEEP PACE WITH MODERN COMBUSTION
Often-subtle design and operating details ensure maximum performance from
spreader stokers firing most types of coal and solid waste fuels

By:
Neil H Johnson, Detroit Stoker Co
Edited by Steven Collins

For boilers up to 300,000 lb/hr of steam output, the traveling-grate
spreader stoker remains a viable process for burning coal or waste (Fig 1).
To keep pace with the requirements of modern steam production, improvements
have been made in many areas of the spreader-stoker system-- including
control of fuel and air flow, and emissions reduction.
   Fuel types. The spreader-stoker-fired boiler can burn a wide range of
coals, regardless of their free-swelling characteristics or Hardgrove
index. In general, bituminous, sub-bituminous, and lignite all can be
burned in a given unit to generate similar heat-release rates. Unlike other
boiler types, the requirements of the furnace and gas path, not the
fuel-feed systems, are the main concerns when contemplating a fuel switch.
However, the volatile-matter content of any fuel burned in a spreader
stoker should be above 20% on a dry, basis.
   Theoretically, the coal burned in spreader-stoker-fired boilers should
be sized to include equal proportions of 3/4-in. x 1/2-in., 1/2-in. x
1/4-in., and 1/4-in. x 1/8-in. particles. This ensures even spreading of
the fuel thrown out onto the moving--or vibrating--grate. However, these
sizing recommendations are impractical. To ease the task of sizing coal
correctly, empirical correlations are used. These include: "Distribution of
Sizes of Coal and Recommended Limits of Coal Sizing for Spreader Stokers''
published by American Boiler Manufacturers Assn (ABMA), Arlington, Va.
   In general, coal that is too coarse is more troublesome than coal that
is too fine. Coarse coal requires slower grate speeds and more combustion
air. Many plants are successfully burning coals finer than those specified
by the ABMA curve. However, combustion of fines does create higher levels
of unburned carbon in the flyash, especially as the percentage of
minus-16-mesh coal increases. Higher NO subscript x emissions have also
been linked to excessive fines.
   Spreader-stoker-fired boilers have also been used extensively to burn
many types of waste fuels, including:
   --Wood--from hogged trees to sawdust.
   --Garbage--as refuse-derived fuel (RDF).
   --Bagasse--sugar-cane residue.
   --Industrial wastes--paper, plastics, and wood.
   --Furfural residue.
   --Peanut shells.
   Water-cooled vibrating-grate spreader stokers burning waste fuels are
more reliable and require less maintenance than do traveling-grate units.
   Grate types. The main functions of grates in a spreader-stoker-fired
boiler are to provide a platform on which to burn fuel, to pass combustion
air, and to remove ash. Many different types of grates have been used. But
only the traveling and vibrating grates are able to balance today's
requirements for cost, efficiency, emissions control, availability, and
safety.
   With the traveling grate, fuel is propelled into the furnace towards the
rear wall of the boiler. Some of the fuel is burned in suspension, the
remainder on the grate, which moves towards the fuel-feed end of the
boiler. The speed of the grate is varied according to load. However, speed
also depends on the amount of fuel being burned per square foot of grate
area--an important design value.
   Systems can be designed to produce a heat release rate of up to 750
kBtu/ft superscript 2/hr for most bituminous coals, subbituminous coal, and
lignite. For firing low-volatile bituminous coals, maximum heat release
should be 600 kBtu/ft superscript 2/hr to minimize unburned carbon loss.
   The heat-release rate for refuse fuels such as wood or bagasse can
extend up to 1-million Btu/ft superscript 2/hr. Grate speeds must be slower
for RDF to reduce wear associated with the high amount of abrasive
non-combustibles found in this fuel. Therefore, the maximum design heat
release should be limited to 750 kBtu/ft superscript 2/hr.
   Design heat release rates for vibrating grate stokers are more
conservative because the vibrating action can over-agitate the fuel and ash
bed, hampering complete combustion. Units burning waste fuels having a
moisture content less than 40% have been designed for release rates up to
250 kBtu/ft superscript 2/hr. Coal-burning vibrating-grate units can employ
heat-release rates up to 650 kBtu/ft superscript 2/hr.
   Combustion air. Because the goal of the spreader stoker is to achieve
uniform burning over the entire active grate surface, evenly distributing
air flow throughout the grates is necessary. Careful attention must be paid
to the design of the plenum chamber under the grates. Abrupt changes in
flow direction or other hardware configurations which might cause air-flow
imbalances should be avoided. High-resistance grates, which put most of the
resistance to air flow across the grate rather than the ash bed,
significantly improve air distribution.
   Inlet-air temperature can be at ambient or preheated up to 350F when
burning bituminous or subbituminous coals. If moisture content exceeds 25%,
preheated air is recommended. Lignite, for example, requires preheated air,
typically to 400F.
   Virtually all refuse contains more than 25% moisture and requires
preheated combustion air. Air temperature should be limited to 350F for
systems burning RDF because of the varying characteristics of this fuel.
Water-cooled vibrating-grate units burning high-moisture refuse--above
35%--utilize air preheated to 650F.
   Until recently, overfire-air systems for coal-fired spreader stokers
were limited to supplying 15-18% of the overall air. In light of
increasingly restrictive NO subscript x regulations, new systems use three
levels of overfire air--supplying up to 35% of total air input--to achieve
staged combustion. Overfire air must be supplied with sufficient energy to
produce turbulence and thoroughly mix fuel with oxygen to complete
combustion. Nozzle design is the most important factor affecting the
efficient utilization of overfire-air fan energy.
   Flyash reinjection. The two factors controlling efficiency of the
spreader-stoker combustion system are excess air and carbon loss. Units
should be able to operate at 25% excess air or less if air plenums and
nozzles are designed correctly.
   Carbon loss is the sum of carbon lost in flyash and bottom ash. A
well-run and well-designed spreader stoker exhibits a very low bottom-ash
carbon loss. Therefore, efforts to minimize carbon loss concentrate on
flyash. The most popular technique is reinjecting the flyash caught by the
first-stage of ash removal--usually the mechanical dust collector.
   In the case of units burning eastern bituminous coals, the combustible
content of flyash caught in mechanical dust collectors is about 60%.
Properly designed reinjection systems can reduce this value to about 25%.
Reinjection can improve efficiency significantly and reduce the amount of
ash requiring disposal.
   Emissions. Several factors influence the amount of NO subscript x
produced by a spreader stoker, including: (1) amount of excess air, (2)
design heat-release rate, (3) air temperature, (4) fuel size distribution,
(5) method of fuel feed, and (6) furnace temperature. When possible, follow
these suggestions for reducing NO subscript x output:
   --Limit design heat release to 700 kBtu/ft superscript 2/hr.
   --Maintain under-grate air temperatures near ambient.
   --Keep coal fines--particles below 0.1-in.--to a minimum.
   --Reduce furnace temperature by staging overfire air or recirculating
flue gas.
   Spreader-stoker-fired systems convert virtually all of the sulfur found
in the fuel to SO subscript 2. Thus, some sort of post-combustion SO
subscript 2-control device is necessary. Both wet and dry scrubbers have
been used successfully. There are also many emerging technologies aimed at
combined SO subscript 2 and NO subscript x control (Power, September 1990,
p 26).

DIAGNOSTIC MONITORING--AN OVERVIEW
Diagnostic engineering is a recognized plant-maintenance function. This
article outlines the use of diagnostic monitoring for detection of
incipient failure, to facilitate predictive maintenance

By:
Otakar Jonas, Jonas Inc
Edited by Sheldon D Strauss

Utilities are in constant pursuit of methods to increase plant availability
in their ongoing effort to improve power generation and reduce operating
costs. A fast-developing approach makes use of diagnostic monitoring of key
plant components and systems as a basis for forecasting incipient failures
and for predictive maintenence. Either continuous on-line or periodic,
diagnostic monitoring includes non-destructive evaluation (NDE) techniques,
while expert systems, knowledge bases, and other computer-based tools
contribute to forecasting of failures.
   Upwards of 30 monitoring techniques are available for use in detection
of problems having potential impact on the integrity of almost every
component in a nuclear or fossil-fueled powerplant. Established techniques
are based on analysis of stress, crack growth, leakage, vibration,
metallic-particle content of lube oil, temperature change and distribution,
water chemistry, and corrosion. Across-the-board application of this
monitoring technology could enhance plant availability by at least 2%.
Their application to predictive rather than scheduled maintenance can
contribute to reduced forced-outage rates, shortened scheduled outages,
reduced maintenance and operating costs (through damage reduction and
efficiency increases), better record-keeping, and easier licensing.
   The value of the approach lies in its ability to diagnose abnormal
mechanical behavior at an early stage as a focal point for preventive
equipment maintenance. Thus, the information provided can help avoid a
forced outage and makes it possible to perform repairs on a scheduled
basis. It also is used to ensure that the needed parts and tools are at
hand when the equipment is taken out of service. At the same time,
monitoring systems can reduce plant downtime by avoiding unnecessary
component maintenance during a scheduled outage. Still another benefit is
assessment of equipment life.
   Incipient failure detection and predictive maintenance are addressed
periodically by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) at their
periodic "Incipient Failure Detection Conferences." (Refs 1-3 are typical.)
EPRI's Monitoring and Diagnostic Center at Philadelphia Electric Co's
Eddystone station (Philadelphia, Pa) and Non-Destructive Evaluation Center
(Charlotte, N Car) are in the forefront of development of applicable
diagnostic methods. Much can be learned from proceedings and reports
emanating from these and other sources, some of which are referenced
below.4-12 Technical Briefs issued periodically by EPRI are another
particularly useful source.
   Rather than an in-depth review of the subject, this discussion is
limited to a brief overview of practical diagnostic monitoring methods
available to the industry. Diagnostic monitoring involves a range of sensor
types and signal forms covering the entire electromagnetic spectrum.
Depending on the particular component under study, a predictive maintenance
system will usually make use of several of these diagnostic monitoring
systems, grouped according to application.
   Crack, leak detection. (1) Helium and SF subscript 6 are used as tracers
to locate leaks in steam condensers and general air inleakage, in
conjunction with a mass spectrometer. (2) Acoustic monitors (resonant
100-900 kHz transducers) detect minute shock waves generated by cracks,
material and weld defects, rubbing, or plastic deformation; audible- and
ultrasonic-frequency microphones or acoustic-emission transducers detect
energy generated by a leaking fluid; broad-band acoustic sensors mounted on
piping downstream of valves detect noise produced by flow turbulence. (3)
Fatigue monitors are used to calculate fatigue stresses and life from
temperature and pressure transients. (4) Special electrical conductivity
probe measures moisture on vessels and piping.
   Bearing condition. (1) Ultrasonic piezoelectric sensors embedded in
bearings enable detection of wear through measurement of bearing-pad
thickness. (2) Spectrophotometry is used to monitor non-metallic compounds
in oils by infrared absorption; ferrography is a technique for examining
the composition, size distribution, and quantity of metallic particles in
lubricating oil. (3) Oil temperature is monitored in comparison to baseline
temperature as indicative of a problem, but the method may not have
sufficient sensitivity in particular cases.
   Rotating machinery. (1) Vibration signature analysis is used for
monitoring vibration frequencies, amplitudes, and phases; rotor cracks
(including shallow, transverse types) are detected by use of 1st, 2nd, and
3rd harmonics to separate vibration signals from background noise;
rotor-dynamics balance technique uses vibration signature analysis to track
and diagnose rotor/bearing vibration problems; laser doppler vibrometers
can be used to scan rotating surfaces periodically to measure vibration
amplitude and frequency. (2) Rotor/shell stress analysis is used to compute
thermal stresses from steam and metal temperatures to determine fatigue
damage in thick sections of turbines, nozzles, headers, and piping. (3)
Turbine-blade condition monitor uses acoustic techniques to detect blade
cracks, row damage, flutter, and torsional events in turbines. (4)
Surface-layer activation involves implantation of radioisotopes into metal
surface, plus collection and analysis of debris for nuclide content, to
monitor wear and solid-particle erosion; remaining surface radioactivity
can also be monitored continuously for same purpose.
   Electrical-equipment condition. (1) Motor-current analyzers monitor the
frequency spectrum of electric current supplied to electric components. (2)
Thermography is a method for pictorially recording emission of infrared
radiation by hot spots. (3) Radiofrequency analyzers monitor generator
radio waves to detect arcing.
   Water level, induction, chemistry, corrosion. (1) Water level is
monitored in comparison to reference level by various methods including
ultrasound, conductivity probes, and gamma gauges. (2) Water induction and
waterhammer in steam pipes are monitored by gamma gauges, conductivity
probes, and fast-response thermocouples. (3) On-line, in-line pH monitors
track acidity/alkalinity inside components under operating conditions;
variety of specific ion, gas, particle, temperature, and pressure detectors
are used to analyze water and steam composition throughout the cycle, help
determine sources of impurities and corrosion and deposition in components,
with computerized expert systems providing useful adjunct. (4) Corrosion is
tracked by monitoring H subscript 2 concentration in water and steam;
corrosion-current or water-resistance monitors make use of in-line probes
for same purpose; in-line corrosion-potential probe relates corrosion
potential to type of corrosion under way.
   Miscellaneous. (1) Filter malfunction is detected by monitoring leakage
through filters by particle impact and other methods. (2) Flow rate
monitors compare fluid-flow rate to baseline rate. (3) Particle detectors
provide qualitative or quantitaive information on flow of particles and
liquid droplets in steam lines and air and gas systems. (4) Transformer oil
condition is tracked by monitoring H subscript 2 produced by oil
degradation. (5) Valve-stem strain sensors measure force on valve stems.

GAS TURBINES PACE NEW CAPACITY ADDITIONS
The relentless march of gas turbines into the powerplant arena results from
continued advances in efficiency, ultra-low NO subscript x emissions, coal
compatibility, and unit output. The latest target: base-load power supply

By:
Steven Collins, Assistant Editor


Gas turbines have long been popular as prime movers for a variety of
gas-compression and power-generation applications. Since the 1950s, they
have been used in remote oil and gas fields, on offshore drilling
platforms, and in gas-pipeline pumping stations. In these locations, where
fresh water is often scarce, premium fuel supplies cheap, or space
requirements limited, compact gas-turbine sets have proved invaluable. And
thanks to its quick-start capabilities--as little as 10 minutes from
startup to full load for large machines and less for smaller
ones--gas-turbine/generator packages also found a niche in the market for
backup- and peaking-power systems.
   More-recent advances, such as increased efficiency and fuel flexibility,
have enabled large gas-turbine-based combined-cycle systems to compete with
conventional powerplants for new base-load generating capacity in many
areas. Gas-turbine-based systems below 100 MW have gained widespread
acceptance for industrial power and cogeneration applications (Fig 1).
   Increased efficiency. Large industrial machines--100 MW and up--are now
breaking the 35% simple-cycle efficiency mark. Natural-gas-fired
combined-cycle facilities based on these gas turbines have net efficiencies
topping 50%. And a recently introduced 40-MW aeroderivative reached a new
milestone--the first commercial gas turbine with a reported simple-cycle
efficiency above 40% (see box, p 64).
   Efficiency of large gas turbines continues to be improved today by
raising turbine-inlet temperatures (TIT). When increasing TIT, it is
necessary to increase the compressor pressure ratio, which is the
compressor-outlet pressure divided by its inlet pressure. The newest large
machines feature TITs as high as 2370F and pressure ratios up to 16:1.
   To withstand these extreme temperatures, advanced gas turbines depend
upon state-of-the-art materials, component designs, and manufacturing
techniques. An improved class of superalloys allows metal components to
operate at temperatures only 600 deg F below their melting point for
thousands of hours--even under severe centrifugal, thermal, and vibratory
stresses.
   Because even superalloys begin to melt once temperatures near 2200F,
internal air-cooling circuits are used to cool components in a turbine's
hot gas path. They draw air from the compressor outlet or interstage
locations to cool the combustor liner, the outer shell of the
combustor-to-turbine transition piece, and the first few stages of moving
blades and stationary nozzles. One manufacturer uses ceramic tiles and
air-cooled heat shields to protect gas-path liners from high temperatures
and related thermal loading.
   Thermal barrier coatings protect combustion liners on new
high-temperature units. These coatings are plasma-sprayed onto the hot side
of the combustion liner in thicknesses up to 0.015 in. For each 0.001 in.
of coating, there is a reported 8- to 16-deg-F drop in the liner's surface
temperature. Finally, a manufacturing process known as directional
solidification is used by select manufacturers to improve the low-cycle
fatigue properties of cast components.
   Low emissions. Several methods are used to reduce gas-turbine NO
subscript x emissions, including: (1) injecting steam or water into the
combustion zone, (2) using dry low-NO subscript x burners, or (3) including
a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system in the exhaust train. Dry
burner systems--which reduce NO subscript x production through advanced
control of combustion parameters--have several obvious advantages: (1)
Steam and water injection reduce overall thermal efficiency, and (2)
catalytic reduction entails handling ammonia and disposing of spent
catalysts that contain heavy-metal oxides.
   Two manufacturers reportedly have developed dry burners which can reduce
gas-turbine NO subscript x emissions to below 10 ppm--at 15% excess O
subscript 2--for natural-gas-fired machines (see box, p 63). Machines using
these advanced burners also display near-zero CO emissions and unburned
hydrocarbon levels below 10 ppm when operating at full load. However, CO
emissions may suffer at less than 50% load. One manufacturer estimates
that, compared to a coal-fired plant of similar size, a combined-cycle
powerplant based on these gas turbines outputs 53% less CO subscript 2.
   For units firing distillate fuels, steam or water injection has been
used to cut NO subscript x emissions to 25 ppm. In areas such as California
and Japan, where NO subscript x-control regulations are stringent,
selective catalytic reduction (SCR) with ammonia injection has been used to
further reduce NO subscript x levels. SO subscript 2 emissions from gas
turbines burning premium fuels are negligible.
   Increased unit outputs. The scale-up of gas turbines has played a major
role in the machine's penetration into the base-load powerplant market.
What may be the world's most powerful gas turbine, a 212-MW machine for
50-Hz service, was chosen by Tokyo Electric Power Co to anchor a 2600-MW,
combined-cycle plant--the largest facility of this type planned to date--to
be constructed in the mid-1990s. The most powerful 60-Hz machine in
operation exceeded its base-load design output of 150 MW in 1990 when it
entered service at Virginia Electric & Power Co's Chesterfield station (Fig
2). The unit is part of a 214-MW, combined-cycle powerplant.
   Coal compatibility. Perhaps the most important advancements
underway--upon which the future confidence of gas-turbine users may
hinge--are those being made in coal combustion technologies (Power special
report, Combined-Cycle Powerplants, June 1990). The most promising of
these, coal gasification (CG) and pressurized fluidized-bed combustion
(PFBC), utilize gas turbines in efficient, environmentally sound,
combined-cycle schemes.
   Commercial-scale coal-gasification/ combined-cycle (CGCC) plants have
been successfully demonstrated in the US. While the installed cost of these
facilities is still significantly higher than that of a natural-gas-fired
combined-cycle plant, the economic viability of CGCCs is sure to increase
if and when the price of natural gas escalates, as many industry observers
believe it will. Developers of CGCC plants have already found niche markets
for their facilities--such as in areas where coal is readily available and
natural gas is not, or as part of utility repowering projects, which
increase overall plant output and efficiency while reducing SO subscript 2
emissions. Several large-scale CGCC plants are now being developed
worldwide.
   The world's first PFBC/combined-cycle facility is currently operating at
the Vartan district-heating facility in Stockholm, Sweden. Main components
include two PFBC modules, two gas turbine/generators, two turbine-exhaust
economizers, and one steam turbine/generator. At full load, the new
facility delivers 135 MW to the electric grid and 225 MWt to the district
heating system at an overall thermal efficiency of close to 90%. The gas
turbine/generators supply about 25% of the electric power output from the
plant, the steam turbine/generator the balance. Parasitic power is 11 MW,
including the power needed to operate the heating circuits's hot-water
pumps. Two similar units are operating-- one in Spain and one at American
Electric Power Service Corp's Tidd station (Power, April 1991, p 103).

ADVANCED BURNERS REDUCE NO SUBSCRIPT X EMISSIONS

Dry low-NO subscript x burners represent an area of gas turbine technology
where significant improvements have been made recently. To illustrate: One
gas-turbine manufacturer guaranteed San Diego Gas & Electric Co (SDG&E)
that NO subscript x emissions from a newly installed 100-MW gas turbine
will not exceed 9 ppm for natural-gas firing--without water/steam injection
or an SCR system. The "hybrid'' burner used on this unit can operate in two
modes--as a conventional diffusion burner or as a low-NO subscript x premix
burner.
   In conventional diffusion burners, fuel and air are mixed and combusted
in the same space. This can lead to poor mixing and cause correspondingly
high thermal-NO subscript x production. With low-NO subscript x burners,
premixing of fuel and air allows combustion to occur with a uniform and
relatively high degree of excess air, promoting lower flame temperatures
and reducing NO subscript x production.
   The hybrid burner represents the current state-of-the-art in dry low-NO
subscript x combustion technology (Fig A). Hybrid burners operate as
diffusion burners in the 0-40% load range, because the premix-burner flames
are too unstable to support combustion at low loads. At 40% of base load,
changeover to the premix burners occurs. In this mode, natural gas is mixed
with the primary air by a series of jets upstream of the burner's diagonal
swirler. Flame stability and low emissions are maintained throughout the
remainder of the load range by: (1) maintaining pilot flames on all burners
between 90 and 100% load, (2) using variable-pitch guide vanes on initial
compressor stages, and (3) using mechanical secondary-air shutters in the
combustion chambers to further reduce primary air flow at lower loads.
   The hybrid arrangement allows all four of the machine's burners to
operate identically throughout the unit's load range. When operating on
distillate fuels, steam or water can be injected through ports in the
burners to maintain NO subscript x levels below 50 ppm. At least two other
manufacturers have recently developed premix burners capable of holding NO
subscript x levels below 25 ppm.
   The main difficulty to overcome with premix burners is achieving a
stable flame, especially during load changes. One design accomplishes this
by using adjacent groups of identical dual-fuel conical premix burners (Fig
B). In this system, the stability of premix burner flames is maintained in
two ways: First, the burner's conical design causes a stabilizing
vortex-breakdown region at the center of the flame. Second, during startup
and low loads, groups of the premix burners are operated in a pilot mode
and act to stabilize adjacent burners.
   Another type of premix burner utilizes staged-combustion techniques to
maintain flame stability and low NO subscript x levels over a machine's
entire load range (Fig C). During startup and low loads, fuel is supplied
only to the burner's first stage, which operates in the diffusion-flame
mode.
   In this mode, combustor metal temperatures limit the amount of heat
released and thus lower the firing temperature and NO subscript x
production. As load continues to increase, a flame is ignited in the second
stage. It is initially a diffusion flame as well--in the lean/lean
mode--but fuel splitting limits flame temperatures and residence times to
control NO subscript x production. At 75% load, all fuel is transferred to
the second stage and the first stage flame extinguishes. Then up to 80% of
the fuel is slowly metered back to the first stage, which acts like a
mixing chamber, with the premix flame residing only in the second stage.
Flame stability is maintained by a small diffusion-flame subpilot in the
second stage.

Figure A: Hybrid burners (above) have been used to drop NO subscript x
emissions below 10 ppm.

Figure B: Dual-fuel low-NO subscript x burner (figure below, left) has no
separation between premix and combustion zones, and is said to be
compatible with both annular and external combustors.

Figure C: Staging of fuel between two combustion regions is another method
of minimizing NO subscript x formation (below right)

AERODERIVATIVE UNITS FEATURE HIGH EFFICIENCY, AIRCRAFT-ENGINE PARTS
COMPATABILITY

The thermal efficiency of one recently introduced 40-MW aeroderivative gas
turbine tops 40%. Approximately 80% of its components are borrowed from an
aircraft engine used in modern wide-body jets. The unit's 14-stage
high-pressure (h-p) compressor, two-stage h-p turbine, five-stage
low-pressure (l-p) turbine, and combustor are identical to those used in
the aircraft engine-- except for minor seal changes and a modification to
the turbine shaft needed for coupling to the generator. Its five-stage l-p
compressor is borrowed from an existing aeroderivative design.
   A variable-inlet guide-vane system modulates air flow during startup,
shutdown, and part-load operation. A variable bleed system is also added to
match air flows between the l-p and h-p compressors during off-load
conditions. The modified rear frame area of the engine provides an
l-p-rotor thrust-balance system, necessary to offset the 60,000 lb of
thrust lost with the elimination of the engine's fan.
   The unit weighs over six tons and is only 14 ft long. For
natural-gas-fired units, NO subscript x emissions are expected to be held
to 25 ppm by using steam injection and 42 ppm by injecting water. For
base-load service, 25,000 hours of operation is expected between
hot-section maintenance outages, and 50,000 hours between overhauls.
   Another manufacturer of aeroderivative gas turbines has developed a
26-MW unit with a simple-cycle thermal efficiency of over 39% (photo). A
popular combined-cycle configuration for this model includes two gas
turbines driving a single generator, an HRSG, and a steam
turbine/generator. For this arrangement, gross plant output is 67 MW and
efficiency tops 50%.
   Major advantages of this aeroderivative engine include:
   -- Gas-turbine changeout requires only eight hours.
   -- Starting time--cold start to power generation--is three minutes.
   -- Auxiliary components are of a modular design.
   -- Site required is small--105 x 130 ft for a 33-MW plant, 140 x 160 ft
for 67 MW.

ICE MAKER ADDS LOW-COST KILOWATTS TO PEAKING UNIT

   The move beyond evaporative coolers to stretch gas-turbine output
(Power, July 1991, p 27) is most recently, and perhaps most vividly,
illustrated by the installation of a large inlet-air chiller at Lincoln
Electric System's (Lincoln, Neb) Rokeby station (Figure 1). Although the
project was completed last September, only one day of testing and shakedown
was possible before the cold, according to officials from Burns &
McDonnell, Kansas City, Mo, the owner's engineer for the project. But for
around $165/kW and no expected increase in operating costs, Rokeby's output
will be increased by up to 22% during hot weather. A 4% reduction in heat
rate is anticipated.
   The objective at Rokeby, like several other recent projects, is to
overcome a fundamental shortcoming of gas-turbine peakers--that power
output is inversely proportional to inlet air temperature. But the Rokeby
project is distinguished by the use of thermal energy storage (TES) instead
of mechanical, absorption, or hybrid chillers integral to the gas
turbine/generator. This way, low-cost, off-peak nuclear- or coal-based
power is used to drive the TES system, not power from the peaking unit.
Rokeby's TES system is believed to be the largest for this type of
application in North America.

Hungry for mass flow
   The gas turbine/generator at Rokeby is an early-vintage MS7001B,
supplied by General Electric Co, Schenectady, NY. Peak rating of the
machine, 65 MW when firing distillate fuel at ISO conditions, deteriorates
to 53 MW at 100F inlet air temperature. An evaporative cooler originally
included with the gas turbine maintained output at 57.8 MW at this
temperature. Although installed in 1975, the gas turbine has operated a
total of only 1500 hours.
   Being a mass-flow machine, the gas turbine's output improves as inlet
air temperature decreases and density increases. Reducing inlet air
temperature to 40F increases output by 11 MW above that obtained with the
evaporative cooler operating. To do this, ice is produced, stored as an
ice/water bath, then used to cool inlet air when the gas turbine operates.

Harvesting ice
   Main components of the Rokeby TES system are a refrigeration unit,
ice/water storage tank, and air cooling coils. A traditional ammonia-based
cycle is employed for refrigeration. It consists of a compressor, three
evaporators, and one evaporative condenser.
   System works this way: Cold water from the bottom of the storage tank is
pumped to the refrigeration unit on top of the tank. The three ice-making
evaporators (Figure 2), spaced symetrically around the top of the tank,
cycle between freezing and shedding. That is, ammonia refrigerant passing
through the evaporator coils allows ice to form on the outside of the
coils, then a hot-gas bypass off the low-pressure refrigerant compressor
passes through the coils, melting the ice which subsequently drops directly
into the storage tank (Figure 3). Ice-making capacity is around 23
tons/hr.
   Gas-turbine inlet air passes through the shell side of a heat exchanger
with chilled water pumped from the ice/water tank through the coils.
Indirect heat transfer was selected over direct contact because it was
thought to provide superior protection of the gas turbine against
impurities in the chilled water.
   Cooling coils are spiral-wound copper tubes with aluminum fins. Design
chilled-water inlet temperature is 34F, design turbine-inlet-air
temperature drop is from 101 to 40F. Maximum allowable pressure drop is
0.5 in. H subscript 2 O. Water that condenses out of the turbine inlet air
is collected and routed to site drainage.
   An inlet air temperature of 40F is considered the lowest safe
temperature for avoiding icing of the compressor. As combustion air is
drawn into the compressor, static air pressure drops because of friction
and increased velocity; a corresponding drop in temperature is experienced
as well. Thus air below 40F could eventually drop below freezing by the
time it reached the first stage of compressor blades.
   Another concern was differential expansion of the compressor rotor and
stator as inlet temperature decreased by 60F. To guard against this, a
five-minute, air cooldown ramp will be used after the engine reaches full
speed. In addition, the cooling system is shut down along a five-minute
ramp.
   The ice/water bath is stored in a cast-in-place concrete tank installed
below grade to take advantage of the insulating effect of the soil and to
provide piping-system drainage in the off-season. Ice is distributed by
gravity and floats like a iceberg until the portion below the waterline
reaches the bottom of the tank. This stabilizes the ice pile and allows it
to accumulate in a cone shape. Rotating water sprays continually
redistribute the ice as the size of the cone increases to prevent build up
under the ice-making evaporators.
   Control of the TES system is based on monitoring the inlet air
temperature to the gas turbine. As it increases, a programmable logic
controller signals two butterfly valves to open proportional to the change
in air temperature. The butterfly valves regulate the flow of chilled water
to the coils. Safeguards were added to ensure that the turbine is protected
against minimum temperatures that could lead to ice ingestion into the
turbine's compressor. Interlocks are also provided for periods of reduced
air flow during startup and shutdown.

Exercising the system
   Rokeby's TES system operates on a weekly cycle. It produces ice for 148
hours and melts ice by cooling turbine inlet air 20 hours a week. Each
weekday, ice typically is produced 20 hours and melted four hours; weekends
are dedicated to ice-making. This cycle meets the requirements of Lincoln's
power pool for peak-capacity accreditation.
   Establishing a weekly cycle, instead of a daily or yearly one, involved
optimization among refrigeration capacity, off-peak power consumption, and
ice-storage capacity. The weekly cycle calls for less refrigeration and
power but more storage. An added benefit of greater storage is more thermal
inertia that helps assure a low water-supply temperature to the coils
throughout the operating cycle.

Machine modifications
   Although not required, Lincoln engineers decided to replace the
turbine's inlet guide vanes with ones capable of passing higher air flow.
This increased the turbine's output by an additional 2 MW or 4% above the
machine's capacity at 100F inlet air temperature. The original evaporative
cooler has been removed.
   Also, as part of the Rokeby retrofit, natural gas was brought to the
site and the machine outfitted for dual-fuel firing. The move allowed the
plant to offset what the state authorities considered an increase in the
absolute NO subscript x emissions that would occur with the TES operating
in conjunction with a distillate-oil-fired gas turbine.
   According to Byron Bakenhus, project engineer, Rokeby is now expected to
be among the lowest-cost producers of peaking power in the Mid-Continent
Power Pool. As such, operating hours for the unit should increase.

DEVELOPMENTS TO WATCH

By:
Jason Makansi


The fortunes of coal-bed methane, like many alternative fuels, seem to rise
and fall in the sea of conventional fuelprices. When trouble erupts in the
oil/gas market--the most recent being the Persian Gulf War--and prices
rise, development of coal-bed methane gets attention. When prices fall,
activity dissipates. In the guise of an environmental liability, however,
coal-bed methane has piqued the interest of some engineers in recent
months.
   Methane has been labeled a greenhouse gas with a potential warming
effect up to 10 times that of CO subscript 2, the most voluminous
greenhouse gas.
CO subscript 2 makes up about half of the so-called atmospheric
greenhouse-gas inventory, methane around 18%. Based on these two
parameters, anyway, methane emissions should be causing more alarm than CO
subscript 2 emissions.
   EPA studies have estimated that more than 10% of the worldwide emissions
of methane are associated with coal mining activities. Traditionally,
methane from coal mines is vented to the atmosphere to protect miners and
property around mines from catastrophic explosions and health hazards.
   Coal-bed methane exists naturally in varying quality levels--ranging
from essentially air with trace quantities of methane to a
high-heating-value product that rivals natural gas. And, it must be
collected and distributed to potential user sites. If not of high-enough
heating value, this proposition becomes uneconomic.
   At least one company, O'Brien Energy & Environmental Systems,
Philadelphia, Pa, is pursuing firm business plans for coal-bed methane that
includes cogeneration at the site or the distribution of the gas to
existing and future cogeneration and small-power sites. In addition to many
landfill-gas-powered generating systems, O'Brien owns several
natural-gas-fired cogeneration facilities ranging up to 100 MW capacity in
Connecticut, New Jersey, Florida, and California.
   The firm's initial foray is a joint venture with Cosap Inc, Dallas, Tex,
to develop 15,000 acres of coal-bed methane reserves in southwestern
Pennsylvania. An estimated 40-billion ft superscript 3 of gas is available
at this site. According to O'Brien officials, when fully developed, this
field could supply one-third of the fuel consumed at the company's two
large New Jersey cogeneration facilities, representing a total of nearly
140 MW.
   Whether by O'Brien or others, extensive development of coal-bed methane
involves some knotty legal and institutional roadblocks. Uncertainties
exist about who owns the rights to methane recovered during coal mining
operations. Also, unsound recovery techniques could lead to groundwater
pollution.

Water/fuel emulsions may be the answer for controlling NO subscript x
emissions from oil-fired gas turbines, especially if the unit is operated
infrequently. Tests at two sites with different machines confirm high NO
subscript x removal levels.
   Process-wise, the technique is similar to conventional water injection
into the combustor. In both, the vaporization of water reduces peak flame
temperature in the combustors, adds mass flow to the turbine, but also
penalizes system heat rate.
   Emulsified residual fuel oil has been proven to control particulate and
NO subscript x emissions from boilers. Nalco Fuel Tech, Naperville, Ill,
and Public Service Electric & Gas Co, Newark, NJ, have extended the
technology to gas turbines firing liquid fuels, such as distillate oil.
   Initial work was conducted at PSE&G's Burlington station on an
early-1970s FT-4 gas turbine supplied by Turbo Power & Marine Systems Inc,
Farmington, Conn. Firing pre-emulsified fuel containing 10-15% water
reduced NO subscript x emissions by 50% or more. Stability of the fuel was
unacceptable, however.
   Further work took place at the Kearny station, also equipped with
early-1970s machines. An emulsification system--consisting of a water pump,
control valve, chemical metering pump, and an in-line emulsifier--was
designed and installed. A proprietary surfactant/stabilizer package is used
to keep fine water droplets well-dispersed in the oil, particularly as it
travels under high temperatures and pressures. The emulsifier system feeds
a single A-4 engine operating as part of a 35-MW Twin-Pak.
   Results were encouraging. Immediate NO subscript x reductions were
obtained when small amounts of water were emulsified into the fuel. When
the water level reached 35%, close to 70% NO subscript x reduction was
measured. Plume opacity disappeared when the emulsion contained between 13
and 17% water.
   These results appeared even more favorable when compared to conventional
water injection rates employed by another utility on a recent-model gas
turbine with hybrid burners. Around 50% more NO subscript x reduction was
accomplished using emulsions with equivalent water-addition rates.
   Tests of the PSE&G gas turbine in a natural-gas/fuel-emulsion co-firing
mode were also revealing. When oil comprised 15% of the total fuel input
and was emulsified with around 85% water, NO subscript x emissions were
reduced by 77% over the baseline value. No problems operating the unit were
documented as a result of using oil/water emulsions nor were any deposits
noted on turbine internals.
   Long-term tests, now underway at Kearny, include 200 to 400 operating
hours on two separate machines firing oil/water emulsions followed by
thorough hot-side inspections. A 1500-hr reliability test is also planned.
Engineers expect to more thoroughly investigate heat-rate penalties, power
output boosts, and changes in CO emissions.
   In Berlin, Germany, one 83.5-MW gas turbine at the Wilmersdorf station,
originally equipped with water injection, was also retrofitted with a
water/oil emulsion system. The plant, owned by Berlin's utility, Bewag, was
operating in cogeneration/district-heating mode but after unification,
authorities determined that peaking would be more appropriate.
   According to engineers close to the project, advantages of using
emulsions instead of straight water injection are: (1) The gas turbine's
combustor is not affected, and (2) emulsions more uniformly distribute the
water in the most critical region of the flame. The gas turbine, supplied
by European Gas Turbine Co, Paris, France, has always fired distillate
oil.
   Of particular interest is that emulsifying agents are not added to the
fuel. Only an in-line static oil/water mixer is installed downstream of the
oil and deionized-water pumps. A residence time of less than 24 seconds
between emulsifying and firing ensures the stability of the mixture.
   NO subscript x emissions achieved are shown in Figure 1. As important,
other operating parameters did not deteriorate, particularly noise,
combustion properties, and CO emissions. Only at loads below the range of
the gas turbine could CO emissions increase above the 100 mg/Nm superscript
3 limit governing the site.
   A long-term test was also successful and helped to evaluate mechanical
modifications required of the fuel supply system and the overall control
scheme. Wilmersdorf now plans to convert all three of its machines to burn
water/fuel emulsions for NO subscript x control.

Direct-contact condensers (DCC) could increase unit availability by up to
3% compared to conventional shell-and-tube condensers, according to D
Bharathan, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, Colo, and P
D'Errico, Stone & Webster Engineering Corp, Boston, Mass. Other benefits
include a slightly lower heat rate, ease of maintenance, cleaner
heat-transfer surface, shorter condenser height and thus lower plant
profile, better part-load performance, and better control of dissolved O
subscript 2.
   In the proposed system (Figure 2), the DCC is a vacuum vessel with
internal packing that enhances contact between steam from the turbine and
cooling water. Cooling water is essentially condensate that is returned to
the DCC through a pump-around loop. Note that the DCC concept used here is
similar to the one used in dry cooling systems throughout the world. A set
of parallel-plate heat exchangers transfers heat from the condensate to the
cooling-water loop. The plate heat exchangers (PHE) form the barrier
between cooling water and condensate.
   Because there are far fewer joints in a PHE than in a conventional
condenser, the potential for leakage--the number-one problem with
condensers and a significant cause of unit forced outages--is greatly
diminished. Pressure of the condensate side of the PHE is higher than for
the cooling-water side, helping to prevent in-leakage of contaminants into
the condensate. In addition, heat-transfer rates are double, and fouling
factors are at least five times lower than those for surface condensers.
When cleaning is necessary, individual PHE modules can be taken out of
service with no blip in performance.
   Tradeoffs in design include the need for 30% more heat-transfer area
than a surface condenser, need for a pump-around loop which consumes
auxiliary power and increases system complexity, and adequate filtration
and treatment for biofouling of the cooling water stream to prevent
plugging. Cooling-water passages in PHEs are much narrower than in surface
condensers.

Probabilistic modeling is a multi-functional statistical tool made
practical by the advent of high-speed computing power. In the powerplant
arena, it is being used to characterize uncertainties in the performance
and cost of advanced powerplant technologies (Figure 3) and to assess the
fate of toxic substances in existing and new powerplant designs.
   The unique feature of probabilistic modeling is that it expresses
uncertainty in a process parameter or input assumption not as a single
value as with more common deterministic approaches, but as a probability
distribution indicating the likelihood of various outcomes. Interactions
between uncertainties are also better accounted for. It is particularly
suited to analyzing parameters whose values are very likely to be
uncertain. This includes trace quantities of pollutants at or near the
limits of detection.
   The technique allows you to estimate the frequency that a particular
value of interest might be exceeded. So, given specific uncertainties
inherent to the system under study, the model can conclude that there is a
90% probability a given trace substance will not exceed regulated limits.
   In general, the application of probabilistic modeling becomes more
necessary as more parameters become important, even critical to the success
of the design. For example, if the designer is worried about cost, energy
efficiency, reliability, as well as the discharge of a variety of regulated
pollutants, then probabilistic modeling provides a greater degree of
insight into how design tradeoffs affect those performance parameters.
   In the case of comparing two or more plant designs or technologies,
probabilistic modeling allows each design to reflect the degree of
confidence of the designer in his input assumptions. Simultaneous
input-parameter uncertainties are propagated through an engineering model
to yield an explicit indication of the full range of uncertainties in
output values.
   To fine-tune an R&D program, probabilistic modeling allows the most
uncertain components of given design to be identified and quantified. This
allows better placement of priorities and, subsequently, allocation of
research funds.
   One price for this insight is computing time. To illustrate: To compare
two integrated-gasification/combined-cycle (IGCC) plant designs, a
deterministic analysis might take a half-hour or less of computer time. A
probabilistic analysis could take between six and 12 hours. In addition,
the amount of input information required for probabilistic modeling is far
greater. For more information, contact Ed Rubin or Christopher Frey,
Carnegie Mellon University, Center for Energy & Environmental Studies,
Pittsburgh, Pa.

UPGRADE INDUSTRIAL GAS TURBINES WITH ELECTRONIC TRANSMITTERS

Recently, a major manufacturer of industrial gas turbines upgraded the
instrumentation package on its line of machines. Existing mechanical relays
and switches were replaced with modern electronic devices, such as the
pressure transmitters shown in the photos. The older devices monitored
discrete setpoints like pre-start values, plus low, high, and shutdown
levels.
   At the beginning of the upgrade program, the decision was made to
install such analog monitoring devices as sensors, transducers, and
transmitters on the turbines and link them to a programmable logic
controller (PLC). By switching from mechanical relays to electronic
transmitters, the manufacturer gained the ability to closely monitor and
control its equipment, as well as the convenience of replacing two, three,
and sometimes four switches with one analog device.
   With the electronic transmitter, all alarms, shutdowns, and pre-start
cycles are controlled by the PLC. New setpoints require just a few
keystrokes to update the software--not a hardware switch to new relays. The
pressure transmitters provide analog signals for these parameters: fuel
system, lube-oil system, hydraulic (servo) system, turbine-compressor
discharge, boost-compressor suction and discharge, boost-compressor seal
system.
   The upgrade meets user needs to monitor various functions of the turbine
for performance, safety, sequencing, and troubleshooting. The
microprocessor-based PLC works with the new analog input/output modules to
perform such functions as:
-- Sequencing turbine and auxiliaries.
-- Controlling turbine during startup, loading, and shutdown.
-- Protecting turbine from abnormal internal or external conditions.
-- Monitoring and displaying analog and status outputs.
-- Responding to operator commands.
   Among the options the PLC offers are condition and trend monitoring,
predictive trending, comparative strip charts, and turbine and compressor
performance maps.
   With analog components, savings in inventory and spare parts are
possible. To accomplish this, transmitters are calibrated for a specific
range; PLC software is changed for specific setpoints required for the
application. There's no need to stock a wide variety of pressure switches
with different setpoints for different applications and conditions.--Ametek
Inc, PMT Div.

DETECT HOT SPOTS IN AIR HEATERS BEFORE FIRE OCCURS

By:
Steven Collins


The buildup of combustibles on air-heater elements can lead to disaster.
When enough heat and excess air are available, the deposits undergo
spontaneous oxidation--causing the temperature to rise higher. Once it goes
above 400F, ignition can occur, creating a "hot spot." Left alone, such
areas may grow hot enough for the thin metal elements themselves to
ignite--an extremely dangerous situation.
   Ordinarily, thermocouples are placed at the gas-outlet side of air
heaters to detect fires. However, this method only detects a fire after it
has started and may not be accurate when there is little or no flue-gas
flow through the heater--such as when a unit is put into the hot standby
condition--because it relies on the convective transfer of heat to
thermocouples.
   An infrared heat-detection system, recently developed and tested in
Japan, reportedly has several advantages over the conventional method of
air-heater fire detection, including: (1) Hot spots are detected before a
fire starts, (2) element temperature monitoring is accurate at all times,
regardless of gas flow rate, (3) location and temperature of hot spots can
be depicted graphically on control-room CRT screens, and (4) the system can
be calibrated automatically in-place using a standard heat source.
   The system is a joint development of Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco) and
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd, Tokyo, Japan. It was tested at Tepco's
265-MW Yokosuka Unit 1, which includes a combination coal/oil-fired boiler
with a rotating regenerative air heater (figure, above).
   To enhance long-term reliability, the system is located in the air-inlet
section of the air heater where temperatures are relatively low and the
environment is free of dust and corrosive elements found in the flue-gas
stream. The actual infrared sensor itself is located outsideof the heater.
   Here's how the system works: A track-mounted mirror travels back and
forth, scanning the plane of the rotating air heater. When a hot spot
occurs, the infrared rays it emits are reflected by the mirror at a 90-deg
angle into the sensing unit. A local control panel converts the infrared
intensity to a scaled temperature signal and measures the position of the
mirror on its track and the air heater in its rotational path. These data
are then transmitted to the plant's main monitoring system, which sounds an
alarm. Operators can view the exact position and intensity of the hot
spot--represented by color spectrum--on a CRT screen. This visual imaging
system makes it easy to monitor growth of the hot spots and the
effectiveness of preventive or extinguishing measures--such as cutting air
flow, flooding with CO subscript 2, etc.
   During 14 months of testing at Yokosuka, the unit is reported to have
operated without any notable problems. In the event that dust deposits in
the area of the mirror--one consequence of co-firing coal and oil--it is
easily removed by a small air-jet system.

CUT SCRUBBER O&M COSTS BY ACID-CLEANING FILTER SCREENS

By:
Steven Collins

Charles Hoop, Columbus Southern Power Co, devised a simple and inexpensive
method for cleaning grit and particles from FGD slurry separator screens at
the Conesville (Ohio) station. In less than four hours, the FGD system's
4-ft-diameter stainless steel screens are returned to "like-new" condition
by soaking them in a trough containing a muriatic acid solution (photos,
preceding page).
   Before the soaking method was implemented, the plant's four screens
required replacement every two weeks at a cost of $400/screen. According to
Hoop, the screens have thus far required no replacement. The 28 cleanings
performed each year require 110 hours, or about $2200 worth of labor.
Replacing the screens cost $11,200/yr plus labor. Thus, the plant saves
about $9000 annually by cleaning screens rather than replacing them.

USE MODEL PLANE TO RECORD STACK CONDITIONS

By:
Steven Collins

While serving as a shift foreman at a utility generating station in
Illinois, C G Vernon came up with a "topflight" solution to recording wind
and temperature data near the outlet of the plant's stacks. Researchers
needed the data to check if emissions were being adequately dispersed and
to substantiate future stack designs.
   Because the stacks are several hundred feet tall, researchers first
considered using a helicopter. However, this alternative was deemed too
risky and expensive. Eventually, the necessary equipment was carried up
above the stacks by large balloons. These were difficult to control. One
broke free of its anchor line and came down in a nearby lake.
   The research team next considered hiring a private plane, but soon found
out that none could fly low enough or slow enough. Just when the team was
about to abandon the project, Vernon--whose son was a model plane
fanatic--suggested that a remote-controlled plane be used. The research
team quickly found a model plane large enough to carry the payload of
monitoring instruments. Soon after, the "mini research plane" was
successfully maneuvered up above the stacks, collected the data, and
returned safely to ground.

CALCULATE LOSSES CAUSED BY STEAM LEAKS

By:
Steven Collins

Did you ever wonder how much energy --and money--is wasted because of steam
leaks at your plant? The next time you come across one, use the following
example to estimate losses:
   Assume that a steam trap having a 1/4-in. orifice leaks 100-psig steam
72 hr/week.
   -- Look up energy loss per thousand hours of leakage in the table
below.
   -- Annual energy loss (AEL)
AEL = 72 x 52 x 240-million Btu divided by 1000 hr = 864-million Btu/yr
  -- Annual dollar loss (ADL)
ADL = 864 divided by (1.03-million Btu divided by 1000 ft superscript 3)
x (0.65) x ($2 divided by 1000 ft superscript 3) = $2581

Heating loss caused by steam leaks

COOK ZEBRA MUSSELS BY RECIRCULATING COOLING WATER

By:
Steven Collins

By recirculating condenser cooling water, engineers at a Commonwealth
Edison Co fossil-fired plant were able to double the temperature in the
cooling circuit. Six hours of this treatment killed approximately 75% of
the mussels that were blocking the cooling-water filter screens. The
utility estimates that two such treatments each year can prevent zebra
mussels from posing any problems to operations.

FLOW MODIFIER UPS EFFICIENCY OF GAS-FIRED BOILERS

By:
Steven Collins

Users of packaged boilers and other gas-fired process vessels have reported
significant efficiency increases after installing an in-line device that
changes fuel gas flow from laminar to turbulent (figure, above). These
"turbulators" increase gas temperature closer to the point of combustion by
causing fuel particles to impact each other--and the walls of the supply
pipe-- with greater frequency and force. More important, turbulent flow
results in rapid and complete combustion by ensuring better mixing of gas
and air when the fuel reaches the burner.
   One company, Leader Energy Industries Inc, Chicago, Ill, manufactures
stainless steel turbulators, which reportedly have improved the fuel
efficiency of industrial heating boilers by up to 10% (photo, below). The
device has a more dramatic impact when installed in low-pressure gas-supply
systems--below 20 psig--because high-pressure systems inherently impart
turbulent flow. However, improvements have been documented at higher
pressure levels as well.
   When Duncan Boiler Service Inc, Kenner, La, installed a turbulator in
the 120-psig gas supply line of an 800-hp heating boiler, the device raised
full-load efficiency by over 3%. Improved fuel/air mixing allowed smoother
combustion and reduced the required excess O2 by 27%. As a result,
NO subscript x emissions dropped from 58 ppm to 35 ppm.

HOW SHOULD WE PLAN FOR REPAIRS AFTER FIRE OR STORM?

By:
William O'Keefe

A paper mill near our plant recently had a fire on its turbine floor, with
considerable damage done. I was hired by the management to help with the
repair and return to service of the equipment. The mill management, besides
calling in manufacturers of the major components to assess damage and make
repairs, did much of the work on small equipment and piping. Although the
fire was totally unexpected, starting from electrical troubles, it seemed
to me that the plant lost much time at the start of rehabilitation by not
having any idea of how to proceed. There was no coordinated effort or
guidelines on major decisions. Individual tasks were assigned with no more
than a command to get back on line as fast as possible.
   The effort would have been much more efficient if at least the outline
of a plan of action had been in existence beforehand. This would apply to
many other large-scale interruptions, too, such as floods or storms.
   What experience have Power readers had with preparation of contingency
or disaster plans for steam and electric-power facilities? Have the readers
developed any criteria for evaluating damage and repair-vs-scrap
decisions?--OSR, September Power

SOLUTIONS

Documentation is the first need
In a recent fire restoration in which I was involved, proper documentation
was critical to a quick completion. Lack of available, up-to-date
documentation could have been a problem. Unlimited quantities of repair
personnel, equipment, and supplies will do no good until the engineering
staff figures out what has to be done.
   In our case, we had about 80% of the necessary information within one
day. While the equipment covered by the 80% was being repaired, we had time
to conduct a walkdown and to figure out the other 20% that was
undocumented. All those who are in favor of undocumented modifications or
additions based on sketches tucked away in a file cabinet, take heed--the
upfront time and money saved can be lost several times over.
J Dage, Detroit, Mich

Pre-disaster photos can be vital
One help in restoring conditions is a file of photos taken generally
throughout the plant within, say, a year before the catastrophe. The
photography doesn't have to be studio quality, either. A shot taken from a
vantage point and relating the locations of components to each other and to
any piping, electrical ducts, etc, will prove helpful even if drawings are
available. There will always be add-ons that don't show on any drawing.
Some of the added features may have been very expensive in time and money,
and reconstituting them from memory can be costly. Guards and safety
railing are examples of this.
   Two cautions on photographing the plant:
   -- Keep the photos at a distance from the plant site, so that they will
survive.
   -- Make sure that repeat photography is done at least annually, on a set
date if possible.
   With new high-speed film, even a mid-price camera can get adequate shots
in most plant areas without the trouble of special lighting. Record on the
back of each photo the point from which it was taken, so that the next
year's series can at least start from what were found effective vantage
points in the past.
R J Allison, Sacramento, Calif

First, know the inventory
Of primary importance is an equipment and inventory list which includes
purchase price and date, or current price. The list should cover all
capital costs and assets in the powerplant.
   To evaluate damage, an assessment program by category or discipline of
work--such as mechanical, electrical, instruments and controls, or
civil--should include the following:
   -- Scope of damage.
   -- Labor and material estimate for repair.
   -- Labor and material estimate for replacement.
   -- Age of equipment.
   -- Decision on whether system improvement or upgrade is involved.
   -- Availability of replacement machinery or components.
   Remember to assign a unique sequential-number system for each damage
assessment. Once the plant has finished the damage assessment, categorize
as complete loss, partial loss, or no disaster-related loss. This can be a
percent of replacement cost.
   Accurate and prompt damage assessment is critical. It will make easier
the determination of repair vs scrap status and let cleanup work begin.
Damage assessment will prove valuable even for systems or equipment
adjudged to be a total loss.
   A complete schedule for the work is next. It will give organization,
added cost considerations, and a target for completion of work in timely
manner.
   Repair and replacement work can begin with engineering, contractors,
procurement, invoices, work orders, man-hour records, and all
disaster-repair-related cost-tracking referenced to the appropriate
damage-assessment document number. In many cases, an accounting cost code
system may be desirable for an additional method of
cost-accumulation-summary reporting. As costs accrue, up to the final
resolution, the damage assessment evaluation serves for categorizing the
work.
R Webster, Charlotte, NC

It's an established science now
About 20 years ago, "hazard, fault, and failure analysis" turned into a
formal scientific method of investigating potential problems in the space
program, aircraft manufacture, chemical-processing industries, and several
engineering systems. Simply stated, the method applies analytical
procedures to any system or part of it to find the potential for damage of
physical facilities, the downtime costs, and the lost-production charges.
This method has been developed in-house by many companies and various
government agencies. It is usually taught by a practitioner trained by the
employer and having experience in the field.
   Applying the above-described analysis to the paper mill (considering it
as a failure) would have allowed management to have established procedures
for cleanup, repairs, replacements, and general rehabilitation methods in
advance. Obviously this was not done, as OSR observes. The early efforts
after the mill fire seem to have resembled the oldnavy axiom: "When in
danger or doubt, run in circles, scream, and shout." From my experience, it
is possible not only to analyze potentials for catastrophe at various
levels, but also to find ways to reduce the happenings.
   Damage evaluations and repair-vs-scrap decision criteria are on-the-spot
functions, to be made by the best plant- engineering personnel at the
scene. This includes selection of experienced plant millwright crews.
B B Brown, Greencastle, Pa

Beware of the asbestos threat
One aspect of the rebuilding effort that doesn't draw much attention but
which is looming larger as time goes on is the problem of asbestos
insulation. Many older plants have buildings, components, and piping
insulated with asbestos-containing materials. Although neglect or even
encapsulation may have led to a false sense of security, when a major
disaster hits, there is likely to be considerable loose asbestos on-site,
already released or to be released during repairs.
   Many environmental agencies are now more aware than ever of the
possibilities of health hazards from asbestos released during natural
disasters of the kind that OSR mentions. the disaster itself is bound to
attract attention of the regulatory agencies, and inspectors are very
likely to be on the scene even before the cleanup crews arrive.
   Any disaster program to restore a plant to service has got to take this
into account. Precautions will be necessary during removal of asbestos to
the point where crews can begin work on the major items of plant and
equipment. Any plant preparing plans for recovery from disaster should be
cognizant of what the asbestos situation is now and could be in case of a
disaster.
G V Arcano, Milwaukee, Wis

Don't rush into restoration
OSR is right in thinking that planning ahead of time is crucial for major
events in a plant. From my experience, I can add that over-hasty return to
service can be the start of a long period of trouble.
   In our case, a flood accompanied by a medium-size fire left us with
water-soaked components,fire damage, and a management that wanted instant
return to generation. We didn't realize the hidden damage from sand, silt,
and water when we rushed through perfunctory cleanups and got back on line
as soon as equipment could operate within temperature and vibration
tolerances.
   After about four months, however, we began to pay the price, with damage
to journals, dielectric failures, gasket leaks, and accelerated corrosion.
I never found out exactly what our accelerated and highly praised recovery
effort cost us, but I am sure that the shortcuts were a disaster of their
own.
R A Masniak, Ft Lauderdale, Fla

Your January problem
What's the best way to plan run time of redundant equipment?

Recently, I have been faced with the question of how to handle the run time
of redundant equipment at a generating station. When planning for maximum
availability at acceptable cost, I have wondered what the recommended
procedure is for trading-off standby equipment. Opinions on the advantages
and disadvantages of maintaining equal total-run time vs either staggered
total-run time or a full-time lead and standby situation seem to vary.
   What experience have Power readers had with improving availability by
careful planning of run time for redundant components--such as pumps, fans,
and even turbines or auxiliary drives? Once a total-run-time policy is
established, to what lengths should we go to track total run time to
equipment preventive-maintenance (PM) times or to failure? Have readers had
trouble with excessive running of standby equipment which may not be as new
or equal in quality to firstline equipment? And what is the best way to
keep records on this?--MPC

SETBACK FOR JAPAN'S N-PROGRAMME AFTER MONJU ACCIDENT

Japan's nuclear power programme, the most ambitious in the world, is
facing major repercussions following a major accident at the site of
the country's 280 MW Monju fast-breeder experimental reactor.

While the accident itself was severe - involving the leakage of sodium-
based coolant - and could have led to a near catastrophic series of
events, what is more worrisome was the slow reaction of the operators
and of other officials associated with the FBR programme.

Their subsequent efforts to `cover up' many details of the accident,
which involved the reactor's secondary coolant system, has led the
Japanese news media, the Fukui prefectural government and others to
engage in bitter criticism of the way the national government handles
its comprehensive nuclear energy policy.

For example, Yasuoki Urano, director-general of the Science and
Technology Agency (STA), said he was extremely angry about false
reports given by Monju's operator.

The coverup involved withholding segments of video footage showing the
extensive damage to pipe structures caused by leakage of the sodium
coolant, which itself was the result of an apparent faulty pipe weld.

Located in Tsuruga, Fukui prefecture, Monju is the heart of a
controversy over Japan's use of plutonium and the government's step-by-
step development scheme focusing on eventual construction and use of
commercial fast-breeder reactors.

Indeed, Japan's largest newspaper, the Yomiuri Shimbun, said in a
December 24 editorial: "Outrage and concern over the handling of the
attempted cover up are brought to light. Unless `Donen' (the operator)
changes, it cannot be entrusted with nuclear development in which
safety is most crucial."

The Yomiuri Shimbun is well-known as an advocate of further development
of nuclear power projects, unlike some other Japanese newspapers, so an
editorial on its pages is to be seen as particularly damaging to the
programme.

Because Monju is fuelled by plutonium, the leakage of about three
tonnes of sodium-compound coolant on December 8 could have been much
more severe. The daily coverage in the media in Japan of the accident's
severity (which was only made known in bits and pieces), the falsifying
of details, and the slow response of officials to admit problems, may
in turn result in a drastic re-examination of Japan's policies vis-a-
vis the use of plutonium.

The country had planned to start utilising some plutonium in the form
of mixed-oxide fuel (MOX) in as many as 10 BWRs and PWRs by around 2000-
2002. This is viewed as an effective way to use up some plutonium, so
as to prevent Japan from having an excess amount in storage - which
would make neighbouring countries nervous.

But that plan, which is overseen by the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry (MITI), could be delayed considerably because of fresh
concerns over safety.

There are implications too for the long-term nuclear programme. The
Institute of Energy Economics predicts that Japan should have 75-90 GW
of nuclear power by 2020 and 90 GW-110 GW by 2030. This estimate,
regarded as phenomenal in most nuclear circles, stems from a recent
projection study funded by the STA.

At present, Japan has 39.6 GW of nuclear capacity in 50 operating
reactors with another four under construction or near commissioning.
There are already problem of where to site new reactors.  Also
troublesome is the history of Monju with construction delays, cost
overruns, postponements in starting operations due to equipment
problems, and assorted other headaches.

Last March, a problem with a steam control device was found, and in
June a software-related problem cropped up. Monju had been generating
power since late August, and it had been scheduled to begin full power
tests at the end of the year.

The Nuclear Safety Commission, an independent entity affiliated with
the Science and Technology Agency, is now investigating the accident
and the series of events following the detection of the sodium compound
leak.  On the day of the accident, it took eight minutes for the head
operator of the Monju to get in contact with the "division chief" to
ask permission to shut down the plant, which was operating at about 40%
of output.

The Leakage was detected at 7:47 p.m. on December 8 and the shutdown
did not start until 8 p.m. Late last month, after this detail came to
light, Hiroshi Oishi, head of the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel
Development Corp (PNC), admitted that the delay in shutting down the
reactor - due to the intricate chain of command hierarchy - was,
indeed, a problem. Oishi also admitted that this delay was itself among
the contributing causes to the lag in reporting the accident to the
local municipality.

Meanwhile, the Fukui prefectural government has issued a report late
last month that prohibits Monju from being restarted.without strict
guarantees that accident safeguards are fully implemented by the PNC.
These safeguards focus mainly on leak detection systems and emergency
procedures. That report came out about the same time that the STA
revised a report on the accident.

The STA had to get the PNC to revise the report because PNC's initial
version contained falsified data. Included in the corrections was a
revised time of the first inspection of the accident site (7 a.m.,
December 9) rather than the earlier stated time (10 p.m. the night
before). PNC dismissed four officials associated with Monju, including
one of the directors in charge of operations. "Dismissed" means they
will still be employed by PNC, though at other sites.

Fukui governor Yukio Kurita went so far as to say that the citizens of
Fukui feel "betrayed because of PNC's deceptions." Fukui prefecture has
a total of 15 nuclear reactors, most of which are operated by Osaka-
based Kansai Electric Power Co.

MITI Vice-Minister Tomio Tsutsumi said that MITI was instructing all
power utilities to enhance their training of operators and inspection
processes as well as speed up reporting of accidents to relevant
authorities. His comments were made in direct response to the Monju
accident.

Monju is slated to serve as the technical foundation for a `pre-
commercial' or `demonstration' FBR, which would be followed by
commercial FBRs, according to the government's long-term nuclear energy
development plan. However, critics contend that the post-Monju plant
will be exceedingly expensive and that electric power utilities are not
interested in building and operating commercial FBRs until sometime
after 2030. The Monju accident will definitely have an impact on this
schedule.

It could also create extensive hardships for planners seeking to find a
construction site for the post-Monju reactor. MITI's Agency of Natural
Resources and Energy (ANRE) and other government groups will do their
best to secure such a site, which requires local approval. But in the
wake of the Monju accident that will be a significant challenge.

Additionally, the accident will affect the outlook on the nuclear fuel
reprocessing facility now under construction at Rokkasho-mura, Aomori
prefecture. The planned measures to ensure the safety of that plant,
which will handle spent fuel and plutonium, will likely have to be
enhanced. And that plant will be subject to greater oversight from
local authorities fearing the possibility of the whitewashing similar
to that occurring after Monju's sodium leakage. Aomori has sent
officials to Fukui to investigate first hand the accident and the
subsequent cover up.

Because the Federation of Electric Power Companies (FERC) decided in
July 1995 to cancel the government-led project to construct a plutonium-
burning advanced thermal reactor (ATR) in Aomori prefecture, mainly due
to escalating cost projections, the FBR programme itself may be subject
to greater cost-related scrutiny and other kinds of analysis. Expanding
pressure on utilities to reduce costs - so as to slash rate structures
- is causing power utility executives to look more closely at all areas
where cost-cutting rationalisation can be applied.

One serious after-effect of the Monju accident is that the Fukui
prefectural government has stated that it will delay making a decision
to allow Japan Atomic Power Co. to build two more reactors in the
Tsuruga area. And, as for the time that will be needed to repair
Monju's equipment, some estimates are in the range of two years, if
extensive redesign work is required.

COMPANIES TURN UP HEAT FOR 3 GORGES FUNDING

Western companies are starting to turn up the heat on their development
agencies to ensure they do not miss out on the a piece of the action in
the world's biggest hydroelectric project at Three Gorges on China's
Yangtze River.

The focal point is in the US where it had been understood, unofficially
at least, that US companies could not count on any support from the
Export-Import Bank in their efforts to win power equipment deals at the
high dam project deep in central China, 1,500 km from Shanghai. This
stemmed largely from the Clinton Administration's long dispute with
China over human rights abuses and the more pertinent issue of the
massive dislocation of people affected by the construction of the
17,500 MW-plus complex and the creation of a huge reservoir downriver
from Chongqing.

It is predicted that well over 1m people will be dislocated by the
project, and it is not thought that Beijing will overly concern itself
with how smooth this exodus will be. The estimated value of the project
is now becoming stratospheric and has been put at around $24bn. The
project, in totality,  could be completed by 2009, but is likely to be
finished sometime in the second decade. First power would come on line
early in the next century.

Recent developments suggest that the Eximbank is now yielding to
congressional and private sector lobby pressure to do what it is
supposed to do - back US exports. It became known recently that a
National Security Council interagency committee had concluded that US
government finance should not be made available to such a controversial
project.

However, the caution to Exim by the administration was carefully
worded. In a letter last September from Samuel Berger, deputy assistant
to the president for national security, the NSC said it would be
"unwise" for the government (of which Exim is an agency) should align
itself with the scheme because of environmental and human rights
concerns and should note the legal problems that might arise from any
decision to provide assistance. But also the government should
"refrain" from publicly condemning the project. "Such a condemnation
would unduly strain bilateral relations." In conclusion, the government
should take a low profile on the Three Gorges project for fear of
harming other US trade and investment interests in China.

The reference to  legal problems appears connected with threats by many
environmental agencies contemplating court action against Exim should
it change its mind.

This will pose a major challenge for Martin Kamark, a Washington
lawyer, named last week to succeed Kenneth Brody as chairman of the
institution. Kamarck's wife, Elaine, is a senior policy advisor to vice-
president Al Gore, which suggests he will be under pressure to tow the
Administration's line rather than that of private sector interests.

Nevertheless, as he prepared for his new position - he is already vice-
chairman - news reports last week from the US indicated that the White
House is putting some distance between itself from its earlier advice
to Exim to stay away from Three Gorges. American companies such as
Caterpillar, Rotec and Voith Hydro have applied for $500m in loans from
Exim. General Electric made clear two years ago that it would
aggressively pursue opportunities to cash in on the project's
requirements for up to 16 foreign-manufactured turbine generators for
the dam's power houses.

The concerns of US industry are real enough for it is mainly the US -
and until a year or so ago Canada - that has allowed itself to moralise
about the project. No such worries as yet bedevil the British, French,
German or Japanese governments, whose companies are now positioning
themselves to chase for business, either through direct negotiation or
in competitive tender. China is still thought to be the big
infrastructure order-book prize in Asia, despite its  inarticulate
foreign investment policies, which are still undergoing revisions.

Analysts do concede, however, that the attempted use of foreign aid by
other countries to support Three Gorges - at least in its early stages
- will arouse similar controversy because of the strength of the
international environmental lobby. The British government was badly
burned by the use of concessional finance to back the Malaysian Pergau
Dam scheme; and the Japanese foot-dragged on supporting the World
Bank's now-aborted backing for the Nepal Arun III project.

US companies have noted Canada's `Damascene' conversion to the the
project. When in opposition, Jean Chretien's Liberal Party condemned
the Tory government's support for Three Gorges, but when in power, it
changed its tune - most notably in November 1993 when Chretien, now
Prime Minister, visited China. Said one observer, "He saw the future,
and it was wet."

Chretien has since given the Canadian Export Development Corp.,
Canada's version of the US Exim Bank, the green light to provide export
credits to back Canadian involvement in Three Gorges. Some of the major
regional utilities, full of hydropower expertise but sensitive to the
resettlement issue, are on record as eschewing support for the scheme,
such as BC Hydro and Ontario Hydro. Indeed, BCH's ex-chief executive,
Maurice Strong, is an environmentalist and is now an adviser to the
World Bank's new president James Wolfensohn.

Significantly,  last year Monenco Agra, an engineering consultant, won
a $34.5m contract to provide a computer system to co-ordinate the
Three Gorges resettlement. EDC support of $12.5m has since been
mobilised; indeed, the EDC had already provided $23.5m in finance and
cover to help Dominion Bridge build a cement plant in China, whose
output will be used on the dam.

The existence of a Canadian option is seen as a benefit to those US
companies - of which there are many - with subsidiaries in Canada.
Rotec has indicated it might look to the EDC if Exim backing is not
available.

Solid opposition to the scheme still lies with the environmental
groups. Probe International in Canada has taken some relish at
lampooning Chretien's volte face on the issue. In the US, Human Rights
Watch/Asia has attacked the Beijing government for its suppression of
open debate or, indeed, any criticism of the project.

It reinforced this with publication of  report detailing a devastating
account of two Chinese dam collapses in August 1975, which took the
lives of at least 85,000 and possibly as many as 230,000, but news of
which was hushed up by the government. US International Rivers Network
has added its weight to the chorus of disapproval for the scheme.

Further critiques in the past few years have come in the form of two
publications, Yangtze! Yangtze! by Dai Qing; and Damming the Three
Gorges, edited by Margaret Barber and Grainne Ryder and issued by
Toronto-based Probe.

Among the multilateral aid agencies, the lobby groups appear to have
had success in garnering fairly cohesive  support for their anti-Three
Gorges stance. The World Bank last year took the circumspect view that,
as it had not been asked by China, it could not support Three Gorges.
Under its new president, James Wolfensohn, who is pushing the Bank to
demand greater accountability and signs of commerciality among borrower
nations, this policy towards Three Gorges is now: `if asked, the answer
is no.' Wolfensohn, it should be noted, is a close friend of President
Clinton.

The Bank's view is shared by the Asian Development Bank. Both the World
Bank and the Asian Development Bank (See ADB feature this issue) feel
they are putting plenty of money into China for power projects - some
of them hydro - without getting involved in anything so pregnant with
controversy.

But much schizophrenia still attends the scheme.

In a recent article in Foreign Affairs, the authoritative US bimonthly
publication, writer Audrey Topping noted:

"Estimates of the project's cost range between $17.3bn and $30bn. To
help defray this, the government has been seeking $8bn in foreign
investment. The World Bank, after overseeing a four-year, $8.7m
feasibility study conducted (in the 1980s) by the Canadian
International Development Agency, refused to help with funding.

"Merrill Lynch and other potential investors have also withdrawn
because of the financial and political risks, as well as questions of
human rights violations."

In Hong Kong, Merrill's Robert Graves, senior vice-president for
marketing and communications, last week told Power in Asia: "Merrill
Lynch has never been mandated to work on behalf of or for the Chinese
government regarding the Three Gorges Dam project, nor has any other
foreign bank as far as I know. There have been a lot of rumours in the
past that we were involved, but we never have been approached."

This does not tally with the fact that in 1993 Merrill Lynch,
describing itself as a leading international financial intermediary for
China, published a sponsored statement in the western media providing a
balanced analysis of Three Gorges, explaining the dam's irrigation,
agricultural and power generation benefits while explaining the scope
of the relocation and rehabilitation problem. Said the article:

"Financing for the project, officially estimated at $10bn, will come
from worldwide sources. Merrill Lynch has been working with the Beijing
government to develop the financing plan, which could include bond
offerings.

"Equity financing could account for as much as 50% of the financing in
the early construction stages, and there is also likely to be a
significant amount of strategic partnership investment from
international sources. . . ."

Whatever Merrill's involvement in Three Gorges is, or was, the fact
remain that the project is now  beginning to gear up.

In recent weeks, Shi Dazhen, China's Power Industry Minister, announced
plans for the creation of a nationwide power grid, which could treble
current capacity. This grid was being planned around Three Gorges, and
is aimed at integrating regional and provincial power grids.

Speaking at the annual conference of the country's power industry, Shi
said that the capacity of installed generators, which is now nearly 210
GW, should rise to 300 GW by 2000 and 550 GW-600 GW by 2010, a
breathtaking scenario.

Even more important was the need to boost output. By 2000, he said,
output will have risen to 1.4 trillion kWh, up from 1 trillion kWh in
1995. A total of 170,000 km of power lines capable of handling 220 kV
of power and more will have been installed by then.

Three Gorges will be a centrepiece of the expansion programme. A high
voltage power transmission system will carry power generated by Three
Gorges to other parts of the country. A new company will be set up to
carry out the task.

Added to this will be a nationwide power network to link the grids in
the central and eastern parts of Sichuan province, followed by other
provinces and autonomous regions. Further, a total of 19 major
hydropower schemes and six pumped storage plants will be constructed in
the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze and three other rivers.

This all-embracing plan also calls for power grids in 35 key cities to
be rehabilitated and for coal-fired and hydropower generators to be
renovated, and increased use of less toxic fuels such as liquified coal
or gas.

In Beijing last month, China Securities, a business publication, called
on China to issue bonds in overseas markets to meet a shortfall in
funds for the project. They should then use the hard currency raised to
fill part of an expected Yn50bn shortfall. The article said that China
could provide only Yn200bn of the estimated Yn250bn ($30bn).

According to observers in Hong Kong, there are increasing signs that
China is paying attention to international opinion. "They have to if
they want any really helpful foreign finance, be it commercial lending
or export credits," said one banker.  In addition, officials from the
Three Gorges Development Group explained that China planned to set up a
life insurance company to provide policies to those being resettled.

The officials said that an application had been sent to the central
bank, with an approval expected by 1996. The so-called Three Gorges
Life Insurance Co, will be headquartered in Beijing with offices
located closer to the site.

BLACKOUTS HAMMER INDIA'S ECONOMIC OUTPUT

India is reeling under one of the worst onslaughts of power shortages
in living in memory. The current crisis is reaching national
proportions and has been mounting in intensity for about three months.

According to power officials, the source of the problems stems from the
country's failure to reach its power project installation targets,
inadequate rainfall hampering hydropower generation, continued coal
shortages for a variety of reasons and what has been described as
`inter-grid indiscipline.'  The government in the southern state of
Andhra Pradesh has recently increased power cuts to high tension
industrial customers to between 40% and 60% of their sanctioned loads
above 70 kVa. Restrictions on peak hour consumption for industrial
consumers and five-hour supply cuts daily for household consumers are
facets of the acute power crisis in the state.

According to officials, there is a ban on power consumption for booking
or water heating in houses and on the use of neon signs at shops and on
billboards. Street lighting is even being restricted to alternate
poles.

The curtailment has come just at the end of an earlier power
restriction regime, eased briefly with the belated arrival of monsoon
rains which boosted reservoir levels.

The problem in AP state, however, is being greeted with widespread
scepticism, particularly by business consumers who believe the
government is protecting  the agricultural community at their expense.
The rationale is that the rural vote is too delicate to be tampered
with by the Telgu Desam Party, particularly in an election year.
Therefore urban customers are being made to bear the lion's share of
the power cut regime.

For example, the government is maintaining a certain minimum level of
water in Srisailam reservoir for release to the newly constructed Telgu
Ganga canal system to provide irrigation facilities for the farmers in
the Rayalaseema region. This has resulted in the closure of the
Srisailam hydropower station and the loss of 770 MW of capacity.

Indeed, it is to maintain the promised daily nine hours power supply
for irrigation pumpsets that other consumers are having to take it on
the chin. AP Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu explained to the
legislative assembly that only 4,295 MW power was available in December
against peak demand of 5,219 MW.

In neighbouring Karnataka state, a 50% cut for high tension consumers
and the 30% cut in supply for all low tension commercial, industrial
and non-industrial consumers since late October has led to a power
supply crisis never seen before, say officials.

One stop-gap is a proposal for three barge-mounted generating units
with a total of 400 MW of capacity, which could be delivered within six
months of the issue of letters of intent. If the deal goes through, it
will be some kind of record in a country renowned for its bureaucracy
and slow approvals system - one of the reasons for the power crisis.

Karnataka's problem is that it is 65% reliant on hydropower; this
year's monsoon has been late, leaving Linganamakki, Supta and Mani dam
reservoirs half empty. In Kerala state, the fast depletion of hydro
reservoirs is prompting a similar requirement for belt-tightening.

AP and Karnataka states are also suffering from a long strike by a
majority of workers in the Singareni Colliers Co. (SCCL) coal mines,
which has been going on since mid-October.

The virtual halt of coal supplies from the SCCL mines in AP has hit the
Ramagundam power station operated by the National Thermal Power Corp
(2,000 MW) and Karnataka's only coal-fired unit at Raichur. Generation
dropped to just 600 MW at Ramagundam as daily coal supplies went down
to 20,000 tonnes against 35,000 tonnes normally required.  The NTPC is
being persuaded to pay in advance for the coal in order to generate
between Rs400m-Rs450m required to meet the wage arrears of the striking
workers of the financially-troubled SCCL.

Coal problems are also hitting APSEB. The state utility has called for
offers for 500,000t of imported coal, but has delayed an actual order
placement. The imported coal will cost about Rs2,900 per tonne, very
expensive compared with the Rs700-Rs800 per tonne for domestic coal.
Financially the board is unable to pick up the estimated Rs1.50bn
($42m) bill for the imported coal. The transmission constraints stand
in the way of wheeling surplus power from the eastern region.

The coal authorities, as in the past, hardly admit any supply shortages
by its enterprises, despite the outcry but its customers. Two 250 MW
units at Dahanu power station, operated by the private sector BSES
Ltd., are operating much below capacity due to low supplies from
domestic mines controlled by government enterprises.

But Coal Minister Jagdish Tyler explained to the parliament last month
that the coal companies had supplied 115.8mt of coal to the power
stations in the April-November period, achieving 99.45% of the target.

The reason, then, for the low stocks at the power stations could be
excess consumption of coal by them, constraints in unloading coal from
railway wagons at the power houses and constraints in the movement of
coal. not to mention the perennial problem of non-delivery because of
non-payment of bills by power generators.

As for transmission problems, three major grid disturbances in the
western region in the past few months have led to blackouts and have
prompted much doubting about whether the region is any better off than
other regions of the country. More rude shocks are expected.

For example,  R. Chandramuli, Tata Electric Companies V-P, has warned
that the Bombay metropolis is facing a virtual grid collapse on a daily
basis. Bombay is accustomed to uninterrupted power supplies but
supplies were hit on December 9.

N.A. Joshi, Maharashtra State Electricity Board member/technical,
thinks the state will have power shortages and breakdowns until a new
500 MW unit at Chandrapur goes on line in mid-1997. With peak demand at
8,300 MW and availability at 7,700 MW, the state is at present
witnessing about 600 MW shortage.

At the same time, the perpetual overdraw by the Madhya Pradesh state by
200 MW-500 MW from central power stations at Korba and Vindhyachal has
deepened the shortages in Maharashtra.

This is an example of grid indiscipline, and has led to a dip in the
minimum level of frequency of power resulting in tripping of power
generating stations all over the region.

Factories in Gujarat in northwest India have recorded up to 80
trippings a month since the end of summer. Even continuous process
industries in the state are reeling under a 25% cut in power supply.

"These cuts and supply shortfall will undermine our efforts to make
Gujarat the premier state in the country for industrial investment,"
rues Grish Dani, the president of the Gujarat chamber of commerce, in
reference to some 20% investment injection attracted by the state since
1991. The current shortfall has been estimated by industrialists at
1,500 MW.

ADB NEPAL DEAL SETS OUT POWER PRIORITIES

A $125m loan that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) was due to approve
in 1997 for a hydro project in Kali Gandaki, Nepal, will now be brought
before ADB's board this year, Arun Adarkar, Director of ADB's recently
inaugurated North American Office told Power in Asia in the course of
an interview.

The decision to "accelerate" the Kali Gandaki project was taken because
of Nepal's "new circumstances", explains Adarkar - notably, last year's
cancellation of Nepal's biggest ever hydro scheme - the 210 MW Arun III
run-of-river scheme - when the World Bank withdrew its $175m support
for the scheme.

Adarkar, an Indian national, who was ADB secretary in Manila from 1985-
1991, and a senior advisor in the Southeast Asia and Pacific Department
of the International Monetary Fund before assuming his present post in
Washington DC in May, denies that ADB's decision means ADB is taking up
the slack in power lending in Nepal, or indeed, anywhere else in Asia,
because the World Bank is reducing its support for the sector, or, in
the case of Arun III, completely pulling out.

The Kali Gandaki project is not "a replacement" for Arun III, and nor
is it in "the same geographical area", says Adarkar.

Notwithstanding World Bank lending for power in South Asia is
shrinking.  Between 1986 and 1990 such lending averaged $999m a year.
But between 1991-1995 it had almost halved to $474m a year average.

On the other hand, World Bank lending for power in East Asia and the
Pacific - a region that now includes six economies in transition:
Cambodia, China, Laos, Mongolia, Mynamar and Vietnam - is increasing.
World Bank loans for the power sector in this region averaged $662m a
year from 1986 to 1990 but they almost doubled to $1bn a year average
from 1991 to 1995.

As for the ADB at December 31 1994 it had lent a total of $10.2bn for
power generation, distribution and transmission projects, and over $60m
for related technical assistance/advice.  ADB's borrowing countries
comprise the developing countries of South and East Asia and the
Pacific and some of the newly independent states of the former Soviet
Union, such as Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic.

Adarkar says ADB's projected lending for energy projects generally (oil
and gas as well as for power) will average $4.8bn a year from January 1
1995 to December 31 1997, which is a big increase compared with ADB's
lending in the sector during the previous three years.  Roughly two-
thirds of this projected lending will be for the power sector.

The ADB Director noted that the biggest borrower by far now and in the
foreseeable future is China, a relatively new ADB client.  ADB loans to
China for power over the 1995-1997 period will total $1.8bn, says
Adarkar.  In second place, comes Indonesia ($787m total projected power
sector lending), followed by the Phillipines ($544m).

The ADB is also just beginning to do business or is renewing business
with many other countries in the region.  For instance loans for power
projects amounting to $100m, $35m and $25m are due to be disbursed to
Mongolia, Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic respectively during the
1995-1997 period, while loans to Vietnam to rehabilitate its power
sector are projected to total $140m during the period, ADB only renewed
lending to Vietnam in 1993.

Among ADB's traditional borrowers, Pakistan will continue to be an
important client, says Adarkar, with projected loans for the power
sector between 1995 and 1997 of $300m.

However, India which used to be a big power sector borrower in the
past, now borrows more from ADB for gas.  Total gas sector lending by
ADB to India was $560m in 1993, for instance.  Adarkar reckons, even if
ADB, the World Bank and other development institutions pooled all their
power sector loans for southern and eastern Asia and the Pacific, these
would still not be nearly enough to satisfy the region's massive
estimated $45bn a year sector requirements during the 1990s.

The massive investment needs reflect both specific and general factors.
 Specific failings are that all too often too close a relationship
exists between the functions of power utilities and government in the
region, with the result that the financial management and structuring
of utilities is often not transparent; accounting is inefficient; and
due to unrealistic pricing, and tariffs not matching the real costs of
supply, the utilities' debt servicing is now so onerous that the
utilities cannot go on expanding to meet forecast demand in the 1990s
in the way they did in the 1980s.

Nor can the State bail the utilities out at a time when budget cutting,
controlling inflation and other public investments, for instance in
health and education, are priorities.  As a result, electricity
shortages, power outages and brownouts are common across the region.

Indeed, according to ADB, per capita electricity consumption in Asian
developing countries in now just 500 kWh compared with 6,600 kWh in
OECD countries, and per capita installed capacity is 0.1 KW compared
with 1.9 KW in the OECD.

On top of this, inefficiencies in the generation, delivery and use of
electricity causes serious losses.  Total system losses among ADB
borrowing countries range from 25% to 35% compared with what ADB
considers acceptable loss levels of 15% to 18%.Furthermore, much of the
expansion carried out in the power sector in the 1980s in the region
was done without considering the environmental impact.

The general reasons for the huge capital investment requirements at
least in East Asia are due to under-investment in the past, acute
problem in Vietnam, Laos, Mongolia, Cambodia and the Philippines; rapid
urbanisation (even if the current urban growth rate of 4% a year in the
region slows down more than 1bn people will be living in towns in the
next generation); rising global competition; and dramatically high
economic growth.

East Asia has been the fastest growing region in the world for 25
years.  During the next decade the region is projected to grow at 7% -
8% a year.  One consequence of this huge growth is that the demand for
power has also greatly increased, raising investment requirements.

The need to promote private sector investment is vital.  The gap
between the demand for large-scale financing in the 1990s in the
sector, and what governments and development banks can provide, may
only be bridged by private investment.

So a top priority of ADB's work says Adarkar is helping countries
create the conditions that make private investors participation in the
sector appealing.

The countries ADB lends to are far from homogeneous.  They include
newly industrialised, industrialising, developing and land-locked or
island economies.  Not surprisingly, different nations apply different
sets of reforms in the sector , and are more successful in some areas
than others.

Consider reforms that are indispensable for attracting private
investment in the sector - establishing an appropriate legal and
regulatory framework; putting an end to monopolistic practices by
allowing competition in the generation, transmission and/or
distribution ends of the business; and laying the basis for sound
management in public utilities by restructuring them into autonomous
corporate entities.

Such reforms have been successfully implemented in Malaysia, Indonesia,
Korea, and Thailand in particular, says Adarkar.  In Thailand the
Metropolitan Electricity Authority of Bangkok, and the Electricity
Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) are "models" of government-
owned utilities that are "efficiently managed, enjoy considerable
autonomy, and have a good credit rating", he says.

In many other countries in the region, pending institutional reforms
and/or the privatisation of state-owned power companies, governments
have invited the private sector to invest in independent power projects
often under build-own-transfer (BOT) arrangements.

According to these, the private sponsor finances the building and
operating of power plants while the state-owned public utility
undertakes to buy the electricity under take or pay contracts.

The best example of this approach says the ADB Director, is the
Philippines.  Most electricity distribution was already privately-owned
in the Philippines when the country introduced laws allowing the
private sector to participate in power generation as well as under BOO
and BOT options.

As a result, Japanese, Hong Kong, American and European investors are
currently developing more than 6,000 MW of new generation capacity,
which has relieved Manila of t he daily eight hour brownouts it used to
endure.  Multilateral institutions estimate by 1998 as much as 80% of
national generating capacity could be in private hands in the
Philippines compared to none in 1991.  Meanwhile establishing sound
management in public utilities - essential if the utilities are to
attract private investment - may start with small reforms like selling
a minority of the utilities' stock to the public, (so that they become
more independent from the government), or farming out tasks like
maintenance, and the billing of customers, to the private sector.
Eventually, public utilities need to be allowed to issue bonds and
shares on capital markets to raise long-term finance.

"But most important of all", emphasises the ADB Director," the public
utilities should be allowed to introduce appropriate pricing policies
so that the prices or tariffs they charge reflect the real costs of
supply".  Inappropriate pricing policies for electricity supplies is "a
major problem" among ADB borrowers, Adarkar adds.  "In India, Pakistan
and China, pricing distortions are the  biggest.  Thailand is an
exception".

As for subsidies to the power sector, ADB is pushing borrowers to phase
them out, and to minimise any cross-subsidisation that may exist, of
rural/agricultural consumers by urban/industrial consumers.

A second priority is to make the system work more efficiently by
reducing supply side losses, and encouraging governments to introduce
demand-side management programmes.  The latter is expedient, says
Adarkar.  Studies in the US and Europe conclusively show that it costs
far less to reduce demand by a KW of electricity than it does to add a
KW of generation.

The third power sector priority is making sure the system does not
damage the environment.  For example, ADB has not ever been involved in
the financing of nuclear power plants.  However when it comes to having
a preference for run-of-river over dam-cum reservoir projects, or for
hydro projects over retrofitting of thermal plants to improve the
efficiency of power delivery and reduce pollution, Adarkar says," for
the Bank these options are not contrasting".

"We may do both", he adds.  "It might be necessary in order to expand
capacity to invest in a hydro project.  But at the same time and in the
same country we might help finance retrofitting of a thermal scheme".

All projects financed by ADB are assessed for their environmental
impact and may be redesigned or even discarded if the environmental
impact is found to be too adverse, or cannot be mitigated.  It also
actively encourages borrowers to use clean coal technologies (when
economically viable).

Coal is the primary source of energy in countries that are ADB's
biggest borrowers (eg: China).  And the Bank also provides technical
assistance to countries to help them evaluate the economic
possibilities of developing solar, mini hydro and wind energy options
to meet the demand for electricity in remote/rural areas.

RUSSIAN GROUP LOI FOR TEHRI HYDROPOWER EQUIPMENT

A letter of intent (LOI) has been issued to the Ukrainian-Russian
Energomach consortium for the supply of electro-mechanical equipment
for the phase one segment of the 1,000 MW hydropower project in Uttar
Pradesh.

The deal has an estimated value of Rs3bn ($85.7m), but has been in
limbo for a long time as the Tehri Hydro Development Corp (THDC)
insisted on a performance guarantee from an international bank which
the consortium could not arrange. The corporation now has agreed to
accept the guarantee from the Russian government, and the guarantee
terms are now being drafted.

The consortium includes Russian companies Energomach, Leningrad Metal
Works and Hydro Project Institute, as well as the Ukrainian groups of
Turbatom and Usal Electrotyzamash. The Tehri dam project was to be
funded earlier by the former Soviet Union.

The 4 x 250 MW first phase Tehri project is now scheduled for
completion in 2000 if the THDC does not get entangled in any more
rehabilitation and resettlement (R&R) problems, which have caused
delays.

Time overruns have increased the per-megawatt cost to Rs33m from a mere
Rs330,000 as originally planned in the 1970s. The THDC had announced in
late November a new R&R package for those being uprooted from old Tehri
town by the construction of the dam.

The big increase in compensation for loss of agriculture lands,
financial help in house construction at resettlement sites and cash
incentives for an early shift from the building site by locals are some
of the main features of the project package - and also a reason why the
cost has escalated so precipitately from the 1970s.

Environmental lobbyists opposing the project have been pressing people
to hang on to their lands. The THDC authorities hope all residents of
the town will have shifted to resettlement sites before June, when the
waters brought in by the monsoon rains are impounded by the dam.

A 4 x 250 MW pumped storage plant at Tehri and a 4 x 100 MW hydropower
plant, with a 103 metre high concrete dam at Koteshwar, 22 km
downstream of Tehri, have been planned for the second stage of the
project.

SCHEMES FREED FROM DELHI RED TAPE DELAYS

Power projects with a value of up to Rs4bn ($114m) have been set free
from the time-consuming scrutiny of the Central Electricity Authority
in a move to speed up approvals and hasten construction of smaller
power schemes.

A government notification has specified that only projects allotted
through competitive bidding below this threshold level will be spared
the rigours of CEA techno-economic scrutiny. All other projects will
continue to be governed by the existing guidelines, which provide an
exemption from the CEA clearance only if the capital expenditure is
less than Rs1bn ($28.5m).

The four-fold increase in the exemption limit is targeted at taking the
edge off the official scrutiny process, which is a source of ire to
nearly all project sponsors. Few projects have been cleared by the CEA
in the past five years.

The Power Minister feels that competitive bidding cane take care of the
cost and other factors which the CEA usually examines; therefore the
projects selected through open tender system need not be submitted for
the CEA scrutiny.

CEPA POWER PURCHASE DEAL APPEARS `ALL SET'

A project proposal in which CEPA of Hong Kong, part of Gordon Wu's
Hopewell Holdings empire, would secure agreement to build coal-fired
power stations in India, has moved forward with what are described as
`preliminary agreements' for a power purchase agreement.

CEPA is seeking to set up 10,560 MW of thermal capacity in the country,
probably using a series of 660 MW off-the-shelf base load power units.
The deal, when finalised, would be a record-breaker for India (and for
Wu), given that it would be the largest private sector scheme of its
kind for Asia's second most populous country after China. Negotiations
for the project began in 1993.

Under the agreement, which involves both the central government and
various state authorities, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana
states are committed to lift 1,300 MW, 1,200 MW, 800 MW and 700 MW
respectively from the 6 x 660 MW first phase of the 16-unit scheme. The
units would be installed at Hirma in Orissa State.

The first unit will be commissioned within 36 months of the financial
closure, and one unit is to be added at each subsequent three-month
interval. Power from the first two units will be wheeled to Gujarat.

A significant aspect of the preliminary deals is that the state
governments will establish "an appropriate payment guarantee structure"
for power purchases from the Hirma project. CEPA also wants to tap into
World Bank guarantees, but this will be no easy task given the Bank's
increasing requirements for a more transparently commercial approach to
power generation by the heavily subsidised and money-losing state power
boards.

World Bank financing, or support by other national aid agencies or
multilaterals, will be important for CEPA which, like other private
power sponsors, recognises the need to create a multinational
`cocktail' of financing arrangements to make infrastructure projects in
high risk developing countries work.

Another signatory to the preliminary agreements is Power Grid Corp of
India, which will develop the transmission system necessary to wheel
the power.

PRESSURE ON FOR FURTHER DABHOL TARIFF TRADE OFF

Last-minute jockeying between Enron and its partners in the Dabhol
project consortium and the Maharashtra government was taking place as
Power in Asia went to press, suggesting that Enron Development Corp. of
the US may yield further concessions for lower tariffs for India's
first private sector LNG power project.

The talks have been under way for months between the two warring
parties to revive the two-phase, $2.5bn power project at Dabhol, which
was ordered by the new state government to be suspended last summer
after construction was under way and financial close had been arranged
with the state's previous government.

Enron in Houston was tight-lipped Friday, saying only that "we are
waiting for Saturday" -  by which time a special cabinet meeting of the
Maharashtra state government will have taken place to consider the
latest Enron/government position.

If there is much more delay, arbitration proceedings against the state
brought by Enron and its partners Bechtel and GE Capital, will be got
under way in London. They are scheduled for January 15.

One aspect of the latest speculative offer is a marginal reduction by
Enron in the tariff, at which the 2,015 MW project will sell
electricity to the state power board, to Rs1.89 levelised tariff agreed
earlier in return for which the power board will lift power at more
than the 90% plant load factor mentioned in the original power purchase
agreement.

KERALA FAST-TRACK SHORTLIST

Nine project developers have been selected for small, fast-track
projects as part of the emergency plan of Kerala state to overcome a
400 MW power shortage which is hurting the economy. The projects would
range in size between 15 MW and 30 MW.

Proposals for the projects, to go up in the next year, were called by
the state-owned Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) and the Kerala
State Industrial Development Corp. (KSIDC).

The developers with project locations in brackets selected by the KSIDC
include the following:

* Lok Housing with EDL of Australia (Bekaal, Malappuram and Chavara).

* IPCO-AGVL (Balusseir, Walayar and Kanjikode).

* BSES (Kakkanad and Technopark).

* Kings International Squa Marine Exports/Steag (Koothuparamba).

* Dalmia Bros. (Kanidkode).

These power stations are to come near industrial clusters suffering
from chronic power shortages. The developers have quoted tariff levels
of between Rs2.09 and 2.13/kWh.

The power sales tariff quoted by proposed sponsors picked up by the
KSEB varies from Rs2.10 to Rs2.63. Its choice of developers includes:

* Euro Capital (Vizhinjam, Kuttikatur, Mudakkayam, Nilambur and
Perinthalmanna).

* ABG (Kasargod and Kanhangad).

* Balaji Industries (Kodungaloor).

* Contake Abadi (Veli).

IFC BACKS AES WITH $79M LOAN FOR MUZZAFARGARH

The International Finance Corp (IFC) has signed an investment agreement
with AES Pak Generation (Private) Co. (AESPG) to provide a $79.5m
finance and equity package to help finance the $350m power plant
planned for Muzzafargarh in southern Punjab.

The IFC said the amount will be split into $39m equity and the
remaining will be raised through a syndicated loan.

The AESPG is the second IFC-financed tie-up with AES in Pakistan. The
project calls for construction of a 360 MW oil-fired power complex,
which will be equipped with a flue gas desulphurisation facility, the
first such plant of this type in the country.

Additional financing will come from a variety of sources, with
commercial funding coming from ING, Dresdner Bank, Natwest  and Korea
Merchant Banking Corp. In addition, the Japanese Export-Import Bank
will provide a loan of $148m.

Singapore-based AES Transport, a subsidiary of AES Corp of the US, will
be turnkey contractor for the project. AES will have an equity stake of
$85m, according to Shahzad Qasim, director of AESPG.

He said that AES expects to start generating 720 MW from both its
Pakistan operations by December 1997 - the other unit is under
construction at Lal Pir in Punjab and it reached financial close
earlier this year.

WAPDA, the state power utility, will lift the electricity under a 30-
year agreement, while another government, Pakistan State Oil (PSO),
will supply fuel oil under a 30-year agreement.

Vijay Chaudhry, IFC power division manager, said the agreement brings
to $280m the corporation's investments in the private power sector.

* The privatisation commission has appointed the IFC as financial
adviser to the privatisation of the Faisalabad Electric Area
Electricity Board. The IFC will help lay out a framework for the
separation of the FAEB from WAPDA so that it can operate as a privately
owned and regulated power distribution company.

The regulatory framework will establish rules for the rate-setting
mechanism, FAEB's interaction with WAPDA, the National Electric Power
Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) and private power generators. The success
of unbundling FAEB from WAPDA should provide a guideline for the
privatisation of seven other distribution boards.

NEW DATES FOR SRI PRIVATISATION

The Sri Lanka government has set new dates for starting to privatise
the power sector by calling for a strategic partner for Lanka
Electricity Co, Officials said.

"We have extended the date for submitting expressions of interest to
January 16, 1996 from December 1, 1995," an official of the Public
Enterprise Reform Commission, which oversees privatisations, said.  The
new agenda is the result of requests made by power operators, asking
for more time, the official said.

The commission first advertised locally and overseas in late October,
asking for power operators interested in taking a 51% in LECO, to
express interest by December 1.

"We got over 10 expressions of interest and a host of requests on
December 1, asking for more time," the official said.  According to the
new timeframe, the short-list of operators pre-qualified to bid will be
made available not later than January 23, the official added.

LECO, the second largest power distributor in Sri Lanka, handles nearly
20% of electricity generated in the country.  The balance is
distributed by Ceylon Electricity Board, the state-owned monopoly power
generator.

WB, JAPANESE LOCK DOWN FINANCING FOR GHAZI BAROTHA

The World Bank and the Japanese government have announced their
respective contributions towards the Ghazi Barotha dam. The Bank
announced just before Christmas that it would provide a $350m loan
towards the cost of the $2.25bn scheme. The Bank's financing will
account for 15.6% of the project's requirements.

The Bank's commitment to the scheme shows that it is still backing
large hydropower projects - this was in doubt because of its withdrawal
from the Arun III hydropower scheme in Nepal earlier this year (See ADB
feature).

The  scheme will involve works near the village of Ghazi, a 52 km long
power channel, a power complex near Barotha village to generate about
6,600 GWh of energy annually, transmission facilities and environmental
management and resettlement plans. The forecast of Pakistan's
unconstrained commercial energy demand calls for an annual increase of
about 6.7% up to 2008.

According to Zoubeida Ladhibi-Belk, power engineer at the Bank's South
Asia Department, the project will reduce the high cost of electricity
and will boost access to power in the country's rural areas.

The Bank has been careful to ensure that all environmental pitfalls
associated with such projects have been taken into account before
committing itself to backing the scheme.

According to the Bank, a total of 22,360 people will be affected by the
project, mostly only to a limited extent. Of these, some 900 living in
110 housing units will need to be resettled. An integrated regional
development plan has been developed to provide health and education
programmes.

Meanwhile, Japan's OECF said it will provide $350m towards the scheme.
It will provide the funds in two phases. The first will consist of
$200m and will be offered during the current financial year, while the
second tranche of $150m will be released after the utilisation of funds
for the first phase. The decision to provide funding in two phases
followed detailed OECF analysis. A Japanese delegation declared itself
"satisfied: that the project was economically viable.

WU PROJECT GROUNDBREAKING

Prime Minister Bhutto will perform the ground-breaking ceremony at the
site of the 5,280 MW coal-fired power plant earmarked for Keti Bander
in Sind province. The project is being undertaken by Consolidated
Electric Power Asia, part of Gordon Wu's Hopewell Holdings of Hong
Kong.

The move is a strategic breakthrough, not only because of its
ceremonial value but because it further confirms the momentum that has
gathered behind what promises to be Pakistan's largest thermal power
project, proposed by the entrepreneurial Wu in 1993.

The invitation to the groundbreaking was made by Agha Tariq Khan, the
Sind Mineral Development Minister.

The project's cost, including all the associated infrastructure,
including a coal terminal to handle imported coal and roads to handle
domestic coal at the project's later phases, is put at $8bn. Initially
this will be much less as the project will be built in a series of
single 600 MW units.

The plants would ultimately require 30mt-35mt of coal annually.
Officials close to the government said CEPA had already provided $5m to
the Sind government to carry out a feasibility study of Ket Bander,
where eight units will eventually be installed, providing financing can
be raised for a private power scheme of such a scale.

NEA, NPC BENEFIT FROM CASH ADVANCES

The National Electrification Administration and the National Power
Corp. are among the biggest recipients of cash advances from the
government, which an inter-agency committee wants to stop to lessen
money claims on the Treasury.

Of the Ps44.4bn ($1.8bn) of such advances as of last October, Ps5.6bn
went to the NEA and Ps4.50bn to NPC.

One way in which NPC's dependency on government handouts will be
reduced will be signposted this year when NPC starts offering
hydropower projects to the private sector, to be built on a BOT basis.

The offers will apply to projects planned for completion between 2000
and 2005. This is something of an experiment as the government's and
NPC's privatisation programme has revolved around thermal power
projects, not the more capital-intensive hydropower schemes.

Excluded in the bidding are the construction of two hydros with a
combined capacity of 300 MW in Kalayaan in Laguna, south of Manila, and
the rehabilitation of the 350 MW hydro scheme in Caliraya-Botocan-
Kalayaan, also in Laguna.

Contracts in both are already in the final stages of negotiations with
Argentina's Industrias Metalurgicas Pescamera Sociedad Anonima. NPC is
trying to persuade the Board of Investments to grant tax exemptions and
other fiscal perquisites to hydro schemes.

To lure private investments, NPC itself is thinking of shouldering the
costs of putting up access roads and transmission lines as well as in
obtaining rights of way to and from each project.

Among those to be the subject of bidding are the 29 MW Timbaban scheme
in Visayas in the Central Philippines; and the 32 MW Villasiga unit in
Antique, a 150 MW complex in Bulanog-Batang in Bukidnon in Mindanao;
the 300 MW Pulangi project in Bukidnon and the 224 MW Agus III in Lanao
del Sur.

* The Board of Investments has approved tax breaks for two geothermal
power projects to be built by PNOC-Energy Development Corp. One is a
PS6.04bn geothermal steam field and a 120 MW power plant in Mount Labo
in Camarines, south of Manila. The other project is a PS2.5bn
geothermal steam field and power plant in Negros in the central
Philippines. It has a capacity of 40 MW.

W'HOUSE SETTLEMENT STILL FACES SUPREME COURT CHALLENGE

The infamous saga of the Westinghouse-built Bataan nuclear power
station dispute may be 99% over but there remains a niggling 1% that is
still to be resolved before the case can truly be said to be settled.

The legality of the recent out-of-court settlement of the dispute
between Manila and the US company (over bribe allegations stemming from
the 1976 contract award by the Marcos government to Westinghouse) is
still under challenge in the Supreme Court.

Some senators insist the settlement has to be ratified by them, but the
National Power Corp. has formally lifted the ban on power equipment
manufactured or licenced by Westinghouse.

The lifting of the ban was jointly agreed by the two sides. It paves
the way for a second bidding at a still-unspecified date for a BOT
contract covering a gas-fired project in Ilijan in Batangas.

The first bidding for what was then a 1,200 MW gas-fired power contract
went to Hong Kong's CEPA in venture with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
(MHI).

The bid award was cancelled because of allegations that MHI was using
Westinghouse technology in its turbine equipment. Another bidder, AES
Transpower Corp., was also cited as a user of the offending technology.

PLN ALLOCATES $94M FOR SOUTH SULAWESI HYDRO PLANT

State-owned electricity company PT PLN plans to spend $94m on the
construction of a 74.8 MW hydro-electric power plant near Palu, Central
Sulawesi.

Construction of the plant is due to commence in 1999 and to be
completed in 2003, the official Indonesian news agency Antara reported
in late December.  To be known as Palu-3, the plant will use water from
Lake Lindu, located 40km south of Palu at an altitude of 960m above sea
level.  The lake has a surface area of 35.4 square kilometres, with a
normal debit of 16.5 cubic metres.

Palu-3 will be Central Sulawesi's largest hydro-power plant to date.

Evidently anxious to avoid the civil unrest that has accompanied
previous dam projects, PLN abandoned an earlier plan for Palu-3, which
would have seen the lake's water level rise by 2m, submerging 274.5ha
of cultivated land and 164 houses.

The head of PLN's Palu office was quoted as saying that the project
would not take any land from the local population nor damage the
environment in any way, notwithstanding is location with the Lore-
Kalamanta National Park.

A 983m pipeline with a diameter of 2.6m will channel the lake's waters
to 373m drop at which the turbines will be located.

The primary recipient of the electricity generated will be a cement
plant in the town of Donggala, which lies in the hills to the west of
Palu.  The cement plant will require at least 90 MW.  The difference is
to be made up by electricity from a diesel-powered plant in Silae, West
Palu.

The Silae plant currently has a capacity of 32.7 MW, which is scheduled
to be raised by 100 MW in the course of this year.

PLN's cost estimate for the project does not include a 46.5 km 150 kVa
transmission line linking the power station with Palu.

Central Sulawesi's electricity demand is projected to reach 148.2 MW by
2003.

PGN SIGNS $1.3BN DEAL WITH BRIGHTON LTD

State-owned gas company PT Gas Negara has signed a $1.3bn contract with
Brighton Ltd for the supply of gas to the latter's planned 600 MW
combined cycle power plant on Batam Island in Riau province.

Under the contract, Gas Negara will supply 60,000 standard cubic feet
per day to the Brighton plant for a period of 20 years.  The gas is to
be delivered through the Asmera-Duri-Batam pipeline, currently being
tendered.

The pipeline project is to be funded jointly by the Asian Development
Bank, the Japan Export-Import Bank, the European Development Bank and
Gas Negara.

Construction of the Brighton plant is due to commence in 1998.  It is
scheduled to begin commercial operations in 1999, with an initial
capacity of 150 MW.  To that stage, the project is said to involve an
investment of $100m.  The plant's capacity is to be expanded later to
600 MW, at an estimated additional investment of $500m.

Brighton, which is 55% owned by President Suharto's second son Bambang
Trihatmojo, is registered in Western Samoa.  The Batam power station is
being constructed together with Indonesian company PT Kresna Tara,
which is also 55% owned by Mr Trihatmojo.

Other partners in the project are Johanes Kotjo, Bambang Riyadi Soegama
and Wisma Suhardono.

Located 20 km south of Singapore, Batam Island is growing rapidly as an
export-oriented industrial zone.  As of June 1995 investment on Batam
had reached $5.3bn.  Exports from the island between January and June
1995 were worth $1.055bn, as compared with $1.339bn for the whole of
1994.

TENAGA HOPES FOR TARIFFS DECISION BY EARLY SPRING

Tenaga Nasional, the state-owned power utility, said it is optimistic
that the government will decide on its proposed restructuring of power
tariffs by the first quarter.

Ani bin Arope, the executive chairman, said the utility had submitted a
"rebalancing proposal" on tariff rates but declined to give details.
The move, first announced months ago, follows a government decision
earlier to turn thumbs down to a request for tariff hikes. The move
raised questions about Tenaga's freedom to implement tariff formulas
which affect its earnings and profits.

Ani said the new proposal takes into consideration the ration of power
consumer groups. "Domestic users now accounts for 40% of our customers
and the manufacturing sector 60%. It was the other way round
previously, he said.

The government had earlier suggested to Tenaga that it raise the
minimum rate charged for residential users under its tariff
restructuring proposal. Tariff hikes are important as Tenaga has signed
contracts to buy power from Malaysia's five private power producers;
without higher rates the state group will have to absorb the costs
instead of being able to pass them on the consumers.

Ani said Tenaga spent up to M$1bn for buying power last year and the
amount would rise to an estimated M$1bn in 1996. Tenaga reported a
pretax profit of M$1.64bn for the year-ended August 31, down 17% from
M$1.98bn the year before. This year's result, while nothing to write
home about, should be "no worse" than that recorded in 1995.

In the last financial year, Ani said Tenaga spent some M$3.4bn on
infrastructure. "We will spend M$4bn a year up to 2000 on
infrastructure." He said the country's power demand was growing at 12%-
15% a year.

Ani said Tenaga had signed an agreement to take a 20% stake in a $200m
power project in Pakistan. It was also in final negotiations for its
proposed 25% equity stake in a power project in Karnataka, India.

Tenaga also was considering an offer to take up a 15% stake in the
M$15bn Bakun hydropower project in Sarawak, a scheme, because of its
deforestation implications, which promises to be one of the most
controversial power schemes in Asia, and which has raised a chorus of
international disapproval and opprobrium.

TENDERS IMMINENT FOR BAKUN MEGA HYDROPOWER SCHEME

The Bakun Hydroelectric Corp. (BHC), the brainchild of Ting Pek Khiing,
the Sarawak timber baron, says it will issue its first tenders for the
M$15bn ($5.9bn) Bakun hydropower dam this month. The project will have
a capacity of more than 2,000 MW, including a 650 km subsea
transmission line from Sarawak to the Malaysia peninsula.

The company says it has already awarded a M$247m ($97m) contract to
Dong Ah Construction of South Korea to divert a river at the dam site
keep in the Borneo rainforests. Lahmeyer of Germany has been awarded
the engineering consultancy contract. Sixteen companies are claimed to
be positioning themselves to bid for the main engineering and
construction contracts.

The company says that construction will start in May, pending approval
of an Environmental Impact Assessment from a pro-dam Sarawak state
government, which will be a stakeholder in the project. The key player
is Ting's Ekran Bhd, which owns a controlling stake in BHC. It said
that a rights (new shares for old) and bond issue were still under
preparation and were not yet ready for shareholder approval.

The project has been roundly criticised by virtually every
environmental group looking into it because of the damaging effects of
the massive deforestation, the impracticality of the scheme being so
far from major population centres and the dislocation of local
tribespeople. It is estimated that the dislocation could affect 10,000
people.

Nevertheless, the scheme is going ahead, not least because of the
support of the government, which, through Tenaga Nasional, the state-
owned utility, will be a part shareholder, as will the national pension
fund. Ting and Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad are also close friends.

Ekran spokesman Sunny Khoo said recently that the company hoped to
raise M$400m from the sale of 8m cu. m of logs. Last August, the
company sold the rights to 3m cu. m of timber to a company called
Ultimate Strategies Bhd for M$405m. Khoo said at the time that if the
company could not get the price it wanted for the timber "then we will
log it ourselves." The sam site, and the timber on it, covers 80,000
hectares.

But according to a Kuala Lumpur-based foreign broker, "It is difficult
to see exactly who will want to put their money into Bakun. Local
investors who enjoy a gamble might be interested but then they want
their money back fast. The payback from Bakun could stretch well into
the next century."

Nevertheless, the government deems the project essential because of
anticipated electricity shortfalls in the next century. The government
recently stated it would not review or reschedule mega projects it
considered critical for continued economic development.

PROTESTS FORCE SHIFT OF WASTE POWER SITE

The cabinet has decided to relocate the controversial waste-to-energy
power plant in the northern province of Chiang Mal in a move to end the
year-long protest by locals.

The decision was made on December 26 as protest against the garbage-
lignite fired power house seemed to peak as some 300 villagers from
Hang Dong district, where the 20 MW facility was to be built, staged a
rally at Government House in Bangkok.

The decision is a defeat for the Government, and the Provincial
Electricity Authority (PEA), who failed to convince the local people,
after a public relations stint, that the project was environmentally
friendly.

Speaking after the Cabinet meeting, Technology and Environment Minister
Yingphan Manasikarn insisted the cabinet's resolution does not mean the
scrapping of the project, sponsored by PEA.

He said the cabinet has taken a view that the project should remain
because it would help solve Chiang Mai city's mounting garbage problems
while contributing to the provision of electric power.  It would be
relocated to other districts in the province provided that locals
agree, Yingphan said.

Deputy Interior Minister Kiatchai Chalchawarat, who oversees PEA said
certain areas in San Sai and San Pa Tong districts of Chiang Mai may be
alternative sites for the facility.

At one point four months ago, Kiatchai, who was sent to brief some
5,000 residents about the project at Hang Dong, narrowly escaped an
attack by a mob of villagers angered by the government's refusal to
scrap the scheme.

Villagers feared that their backyard would be turned into a dumping
site of garbage and the combustion of rubbish and the lignite would
create adverse environmental impact to their neighbourhood.

For the time being, it is not known the extent of effect the Cabinet's
resolution has on the $57.2m contract PEA awarded last March to
Kvaerner EnviroPower AB of Sweden to build the plant (PiA 173, Apr 3).

Yingphan only said that PEA would need to negotiate with Swedish
offshoot of Norwegian Kvaerner industrial group about the new operating
environment.

The scheme was earlier set to come on line on December 5, 1996.  But
opposition has delayed construction for nearly a year, making it
impossible to achieve that date.

DSM TO GET $40M

Thailand will earmark 1bn baht ($40m) budget for its demand side
management (DSM) project in 1996 as part of the continuation of its
energy conservation programme.  According to Sithiporn Ratanopas, EGAT
DSM director, 300m baht will go towards advertisement to promote public
awareness on energy conservation.  The advertising effort will focus on
promoting energy-efficient electrical appliance like refrigerators, air-
conditioners, ballasts and compact fluorescent bulbs.  The remaining
700m baht fund will for efficiency testing of air conditioners and
refrigerators, and developing a thermal storage and efficient motor
programmes.

EGAT is attempting to replace 20m typical ballasts in hotels and large
buildings nationwide with those which can save up to 40% of electricity
consumption.  EGAT will also use an energy saving label campaign with
7,00-27,000-BTU air conditioners in 1996.  The degree of energy-saving
capacity indication will vary from one to five.  In 1996, EGAT will
begin to import 20 watt compact fluorescent tubes, which will replace
conventional 100 watt bulb.   They will be sold 20% below import price.
 The volume of import will be 1.6m units, worth 306m baht.

The power authority has spend 87m baht to promote "slim" fluorescent
and energy-saving label campaigns in 1995.  The success of the two
campaign is a booster for EGAT to go further with its energy
conservation campaign in 1996.  Sithiporn said the DSM project would
help reduce Thailand's power consumption by 10%, or 100bn units per
year.

OLD HYDRO SCHEME GETS NEW UNIT

EGAT marked the completion of a 2.71 baht *$108.4m) scheme that further
maximises the hydro benefits derived from Thailand's first
hydroelectric dam.

The opening of the Lower Mae Ping project, an extension of the 31-year-
old Bhumibol dam in the northwestern province of Tak, was officiated by
HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn on December 28.

An additional turbine generating unit, the eighth of Bhumibol and of a
pumped storage type, will beef up Bhumibol's combined installed
generating capacity by 32% to 720.8 MW, starting this month to augment
peak power supplies.

The Lower Mae Ping dam was built across the Mae Ping river some 5 km
downstream of the Bhumibol dam in the province's Sam Ngao district.  It
is 200 metres wide and eight metres high.  Construction began in June
1991, but the cost inflated from 2.35bn baht to 2.71bn baht.

The secondary dam helps to hold back the stream flowed through Bhumibol
and the pumps divert part of the water back to the main dam by a pump
which will be operated during the off-peak period.

EGAT director Somboon Manenava said the Lower Mae Ping dam could helps
to conserve about 450m cubic metres of water annually which would other
be drained out from the system.  The project is capable of pumping back
3.5m cubic metres of water each day back to the main Bhumibol dam for
irrigation and power generation.

Lower Mae Ping turbine generator was supplied by a consortium of
Kvaerner Energy AS and ABB Power Generation Ltd.  The civil works were
undertaken by Vianini Lavori SpA.

Meanwhile, as additional sites for developing new hydro have either run
out or have been restricted by environmentalists' opposition, the Thai
power authority is turing to pumped storage to maximise benefits from
existing dams.

EGAT is now assessing he economic proposition of installing pumped
storage systems at the Khirithan dam in Chanthaburi, the Chulabhorn dam
in the northeastern province of Chaiyaphum and Ta Tung Na dam in the
western province Kanchanaburi.

EGAT g-m Preecha Chungwatana said these possible pumped storage sites
are in various stages of study.  That of the Khirithan seems to be in
the most advanced phase with reports are mostly completed and a public
relation campaign is being exercised to win approval from villagers.

It is too early to say how EGAT would proceed with possible pumped
storage projects nor to detail how much more electrical power they can
render, according to the EGAT chief.  The current installed generating
capacity of Khirithan is 12.70 MW, 40 MW at Chulabhorn 40 MW and 38 MW
at Ta Tung Na.

EGAT has already completed two pumped storage projects, one at the Sri
Nakarin dam in Kanchanaburi with installed capacity of 720 MW and more
recently at Bhumibol.

A third pumped storage scheme now under construction is the Lam
Takhong, rated 1,000 MW, in Nakhon Ratchasima, some 200 km northeast of
Bangkok.  The initial phase of the scheme with is slated to come on
line in stages beginning in the year 2000 (PiA 191, Dec 11).

According to Preecha said the pumped storage hydroelectric projects are
viewed generally as the best method to fully utilise the country's
limited hydro resources both for the purpose of power generation and
irrigation.  EGAT has no firm plan to start any new dam projects.  As
at the end of November EGAT was operating 53 hydro generation units
with a combined installed capacity of 2,690 MW, representing about 18%
of EGAT's total installed capacity of 14,595 MW.

SETBACK FOR MALAY POWER EXPORTS

Malaysia's bid to export electricity to Thailand has initially met with
rejection from its potential Thai buyer, and the prospects for
establishing an agreement now seem remote.

Preecha Chungwatana, EGAT's g-m said the basic power tariff and supply
terms offered by Tenaga Technology Perlis (TTG), part of Malaysia's
Tenaga Nasional Bhd, are unacceptable.

TTG proposed a base tariff of 6 cents/kWh at the delivery point on the
Thailand-Malaysia border as well as requiring EGAT to take delivery of
the entire proposed load of 300 MW on a "fully despatchable" basis, on
a firm and full continuous basis for the entire life of the long-term
supply contract.

The EGAT chief said the proposed price is simply too high as it exceeds
the rate on which EGAT pays for electricity purchased from other
sources such as Laos or for power generated from EGAT's own power
plants in Thailand.  The current base price of power EGAT buys from
Laos is around 4 cents/kWh.

Furthermore, EGAT is only prepared to take the full proposed load
during Thailand's peak afternoon/early evening power demand with a
provision to guarantee a minimum offtake of 50% - 60% of the total
proposed capacity at any time of the day.

EGAT's reaction to the terms proposed by TTG could spell doom of the
large natural gas-fired combined-cycle plant being planned by Tenaga in
northern Malaysian peninsula state of Perils near the Thai border.

EGAT has already made its stance known to TTG and asked the Malaysian
outfit to sweeten its proposal and come up with a new offer later.  But
the EGAT chief expressed doubts if TTG could reduce the offered power
tariff further because the cost of power generation in Malaysia is
high.

According to Preecha, Malaysia initially wanted to sell its indigenous
natural gas to Thailand, but later opted to sell electricity generated
from its natural gas as this energy form provides greater
profitability.  (PiA 178, June 12).

The EGAT chief noted that Thailand, especially its southern region, may
not need to rely on the proposed power sales from Malaysia in the short
term because of EGAT's surplus generating capacity in the region.  EGAT
presently has a combined installed generating capacity of about 1,200
MW in the region while demand is about 1,000 MW, therefore, he added.

Meanwhile, Laos has continued to make new offers to sell electricity
from several of its hydro electric power stations to EGAT.  Lately,
Laos and groups of international companies have presented details of
Nam Thuen I and Nam Ngum projects to EGAT officials, said Preecha.

LAMPANG LIGNITE SCHEME MAY BE BACK ON AGAIN

EGAT is eyeing opportunities to revive a plan to build a huge power
house using indigenous lignite reserves in the northern province of
Lampang.

EGAT Chief Preecha Chungwatana pointed to the possibilities of reviving
the 2,400 MW project, now on the "indefinite" waiting list after being
shelved in 1924.  The process of reviving this multi-billion-dollar
scheme could start as soon as EGAT succeeded in convincing authorities
and the public that the lignite-fired power plant was indeed
environmentally acceptable.

EGAT's existing lignite-fuelled Mae Moh power station in this province,
700 km north of Bangkok, has been in the centre of public criticism and
protests for causing pollution to its neighbourhood due to its emission
of sulphur dioxide and dust for several years.

Over the past two years, EGAT has started to equip sulphur dioxide
control systems to six of the newer generating units at the plant.

For the time being, there seems to be a good chance of proving that the
lignite-fired power station can be environmentally friendly, given that
the desulphurising systems installed in some generating units at Mae
Moh have worked well in effectively curbing sulphur dioxide emission.

The revival of the Lampang project is basically aimed at serving two
purposes.  First, to utilise the remaining lignite reserves at Mae Moh,
estimated at some 600mt in the "mineable" reserve category.  Secondly,
the additional generating capacity would enable EGAT to respond to the
country's fast-growing electricity demand in the future.

NEW ADB PLEDGE TO BACK CHINESE HYDRO AT TING RIVER

A total of 600 MW of peak power generating capacity, capable of
generating an average of 1,520 GWh of electricity a year, will be added
onto a major hydro scheme planned for the Ting River, in the Mianhuatan
Valley in Fujiian Province, China, with the help of a $170m loan from
the Asian Development Bank (ADB).

The project, costing a total $721m, all of which - apart from the ADB
loan - will be financed by Chinese loans and funds, is going to involve
the construction of: a 111-metre high, 302-metre long, roller-compacted-
concrete gravity dam and gated spillway; an underground power station
with four 150 MW turbine generator units and related tunnels; a ship
hoist to enable barges of up to 500t capacity to pass safely over the
currents at the dam site; and two single-circuit, and one double-
circuit 220 kV transmission lines, with a total length of 360 km and
substation facilities, connecting the new power station to the Fujiian
grid.

According to Arun Adarkar, the ADB's US chief direct beneficiaries of
the project will be industrial, residential and agricultural consumers
who now endure power shortages during peak hours, as a consequence of
the province's rapid economic growth.  The latter averaged 13.8% a year
from 1985-1994.

During the same period electricity generation in the province increased
almost fourfold.  However this expansion failed to keep pace with
demand, and the Fujiian Province's Electric Power Bureau estimated
supply shortages in 1994 of over 1,100 GWh, or 7.2% of annual sales.
ADB reckons this may be an under-estimate.

Meanwhile, indirect beneficiaries will be residents, and industrial and
agricultural enterprises situated downstream on the Ting River.  These
stand to gain because a reservoir is going to be created at the hydro
site, 64 square metres in size with a flow regulating storage capacity
of 1,122m cubic metres.  However at the dam site itself an estimated
36,000 people out of 41,000 living in the area will be displaced by
flooding, and will have to be re-located.

The project will help develop hydropower, a renewable resource, and
reduce Fujiian's reliance on coal, which causes pollution and is mainly
imported.  At the end of 1994 the installed capacity of the Fujiian
Power Grid was 5,261 MW; 3,261 MW of this was provided by hydro plants
(62%), and 2,000 MW by thermal plants (38%).  Only about 30% of
Fujiian's hydro potential has been developed so far.

As well as the $170m loan, ADB is providing $300,000 in technical
assistance to implement institutional reforms.  The underlying aim of
these is to separate the management of the Fujiian Province's Electric
Power Bureau from the management of the Fujiian Province's government.
In addition the technical assistance will be used to overhaul the
structure and levels of the Province's electricity tariffs.  ADB
sources say this is an area where a lot of work has to be done as
China's electricity pricing system in general is still extremely
distorted and often relies on subsidies.

The Mianhuatan Valley project will be the biggest of five-cascade hydro
schemes on the Ting River.  The other four are: a 140 MW Qingxi plant
in Guangdong Province, which has been commissioned; a 40 MW Jinshan
project which is under construction; and a 51 MW Huilong project and a
30 MW Shang Hang project which will be constructed after 2000.

The project confirms ADB's commitment to China.  Though a relatively
new borrower of the Bank, China is now the Bank's "biggest borrower"
for power projects, ahead of all of ADB's other clients.

WEAK HK ECONOMY FORCES CLP TO TRIM OUTLAY

China Light and Power has revised down its capital expenditure forecast
for 1992-1999 from HK$54bn to HK$52bn.

It is the second time within two years that CLP has had to revise down
its capital expenditure.  In 1994 the company trimmed capital
expenditure from HK$60bn to HK$54bn.

The reason for the current revision is the same as that given two years
ago, a drop in consumer demand for electricity, according to the
company.  The announcement was made recently at CLP's annual general
meeting in Hong Kong.

The fall in demand has meant that CLP has had to delay the
commissioning of the last four units of the Black Point Power station
until 2002.

The first four units of the 2,500 MW power station will start being
phased in this year.

CLP chairman Sir Sidney Gordon told the AGM that because of the drop in
demand the company had decide not to take part in the Daya Bay two
nuclear power plant at Ling Ao in Guangdong province.  Sir Sidney CLP
has had to react to the economic changes now taking place in Hong Kong.

He said that over the past 12 months Hong Kong had experienced an
unemployment rate of 3.6%, the highest in nine years; a slowing growth
of gross domestic product to 4.8% and flat retail sales.

"From our information some 30 factories either relocated to China or
shut down during the first six months of 1995, due to high operating
costs in Hong Kong, especially wages and rental costs," Sir Sidney
said, "and the trend is likely to continue."

"All these point to the urgent need for Hong Kong to lower its cost
structure in order to make it an affordable place in which to conduct
manufacturing and commercial business," he said.

"Our core business in Hong Kong, a barometer of the local economy, is
showing signs of change.  Sales to the manufacturing sector, for
instance, which used to form the backbone of our business and
contributing more than a third of our total sales, has dropped to half
that figure and is likely to go down even further over the next few
years."

He said that annual growth in overall sales is expected to hover
between 3% and 5.5% in line with GDP forecasts.

Sir Sidney said CLP acknowledged there was a problem, and the company's
senior management had spent the last 18 months carrying out a
comprehensive review of the company's position.  The result has been a
`macro-strategic plan' and a detailed' change plan.'

"The plans will focus on improving the utilisation of assets and
resources, streamlining procedures and setting and achieving a
performance target benchmarked to world's best practices," he said.

"At the same time we are leveraging our core skills in the engineering
and finance streams to develop new businesses in China and other parts
of Asia.

"In essence the strategic plans calls for the company's management to
take active steps to ensure the continued success of the core business
in Hong Kong and to explore investment opportunities elsewhere."

Sir Sidney said that due to the slowing down in local demand the
company had decided to reduce the size or defer the commissioning dates
of various power generating and transmission projects which should
result in large savings.

The delaying in commissioning of the last four units of the gas-fired
Black Point is part of the cost-saving exercise.

Sir Sidney said CLP intended to stretch the transmission and
distribution system by making it "work harder".  In doing so, he
admitted that there would be an "element of risk which, whilst
manageable for a short period, should not be either overlooked or
forgotten."

"In addition, management has imposed stringent control on manpower and
other operational expenses which we believe will bring about
significant savings by the end of the decade," he said.

On tariff increases, Sir Sidney said that "over the next few years
tariff increases will be below the prevailing inflation rate.  This is
no small commitment in view of the fact that in the past 10 years our
basic tariff has lagged behind inflation by nearly 80%," he said.

CHINA PIPING NATURAL GAS TO HONG KONG

China has begun piping natural gas to Hong Kong under a 20-year term
contract to feed the territory's power industry starting January 1,
officials from state-owned China National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC)
said.  The gas is sourced from the Yacheng 13-1 field, located in the
South China Sea.  The field has an annual production of about 3.4bn
cubic metres of gas.  A total of 2.9m will be piped to Hong Kong via a
790 km pipeline, completed in June last year.  The remaining 0.5bn of
gas will be supplied to China's Hainan power station and chemical
plants via another 91 km pipeline.  Yacheng 13-1 development project is
51% owned by CNOOC, 14.3% by Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Corp
and 34.7% by Arco China.  The term supply into Hong Kong was signed
with Castle Peak Power Corp, a 50-50 joint venture between China Light
and Power and Exxon.  The piped gas will be used to feed the CLPs Black
Point Power station in Hong Kong.

MAJOR POWER SECTOR SHAKEUP

The Chinese government is to establish a National Power Corp to
supervise the supply of electricity throughout the country.

According to a report in the China Daily recently, the Ministry of
Power Industry is to be dissolved within the next few months and its
functions transferred to the corporation.

Power Industry Minister, Shi Dazhen made the announcement at a recent
conference in Beijing on China's power industry.

Although details are not clear, it is understood that the government
wants to separate the functions of enterprise from that of government.

According to the China Daily report the supervision of the industry
will be handled by the State Planning Commission and the State Economic
and Trade Commission while the China Electricity Council will act in an
advisory capacity between government, industry and enterprises.  The
National Power Corp will be the first step in the restructuring
process.

According to the report the National Power Corp will be the umbrella,
or parent, with regional companies as its subsidiaries.  Regional
companies will be responsible for provincial power companies who in
turn will be responsible for local power plants.

Science research and design institutes and colleges will become parts
of the National Power Corp and relations between them will be
established on the basis of property ownership.

Shi said China had installed power generators with a capacity of 75,000
MW over the past five years, including hydropower machines with 13,000
MW capacity.  Production of electricity has increased on an average
growth of 9.8% in the last five years, compared with 8.8% during 1986-
1990.

SUMITOMO METAL PLANS TO MOVE INTO POWER SECTOR

Sumitomo Metal Industries, based in Osaka, intends to enter the
electric power wholesaling business by selling excess power that it
generates at its steel mills in Ibaraki, Osaka and Kansai prefectures.

The Kachima facility, Ibaraki, would sell power to Tepco, while the
other two facilities would sell to Kansai Electric if the company
submits successful bids to supply power.

Other steelmakers that are interested in the business are Kawasaki
Steel, Nippon Steel and Kobe Steel. Energy-related companies
considering moves to enter the power wholesale sector include Tomen
Corp., Japan Energy Corp. and Nippon Oil Co.

Moreover, Mitsubishi Materials Corp. is the first Japanese nonferrous
metal company to announce a plan to venture into the business. It hopes
to construct a coal-burning plant as large as 100 MW to sell power to
Nagoya-based Chubu Electric. Another option for Mitsubishi Materials is
to construct a coal burning facility that would supply Kyushu Electric,
which is headquartered in Fukuoka. In either case, the facility would
be constructed at an existing nonferrous metal or cement factory site.

DEMAND TO GROW 0.8%

Japan's electricity demand for this fiscal year ending March 31 is
expected to grow by a mere 0.8% from the previous year to 723.79bn
kilowatt hours, an industry research institute said.  Demand from large
industrial users is low in 1995/96, as a sluggishness domestic economy
has forced them to cut production because of growing inventories, the
Research Institute of Electric Power Industry said in a report.

Electricity demand in fiscal 1996/97 is forecast to rise by 1.9% to
737.41bn kWh.  An anticipated slight economic recovery in 1996/97 is
expected to drive up demand from large industrial users, the report
said.

If Japan goes through an exceptionally hot summer in 1996/97, as in
1994/95, electricity demand will surge by 4.4% from the previous year,
it said.  In electricity demand soared 7.4% from a year earlier.

Power generation in November rose 3.9% year-on-year to 65bn kWh, the
Federation of Electric Power Companies reported.

The federation said the increase in November electricity generation was
due to lower temperatures compared with a year earlier, which pushed up
heating demand.

Of the total electricity generation in November, nuclear power
generation by Japan's nine major electric power companies gained 13.8%
from the same period last year to 21.6bn kWh.

Hydropower generation surged 20.5% year-on-year to 3.5bn kWh.  The jump
reflects extremely low hydropower generation last November because of
water shortages.

Thermal power generation fell 4.7% due to the increase in nuclear power
generation, to 32.3bn kWh.

Japan's power utilities burnt 1.30m kilolitres (kl) of heavy fuel oil
for electricity during November, 1.47m kl of crude oil, 2.33m kl of
liquefied natural gas and 47,669 kl of naphtha, the federation said.

The companies consumed a total of 1.85mt of coal in November.

ENTERGY LOCKS UP CITIPOWER

Entergy Corp. of the US has completed its takeover for Citipower, the
last of five power distributors sold off by the Victoria government.

The deal had been expected. Entergy had been named as the preferred
buyer and will pay a total of A$1.75bn, which includes a capital
payment of A$1.58bn and franchise fees with a present value of A$173m.

Despite the apparent `sell out' to foreign interests - all five
distributors were sold to US companies - the deal is regarded as a
success for Victoria state. It has raised A$9bn, more than domestic
analysts had predicted. A total of $1.3bn of the Citipower sale will go
towards paying off the state's debts.

WHOLESALE PRICING CLAIMED TO BE `ANTI-COMPETITIVE'

Major power users who make up 30% of New Zealand demand believe interim
wholesale pricing arrangements are "highly anti-competitive." They say
there are better ways to provide a learning environment until full
wholesale competition comes in later in 1996.

Competition watchdog, the Commerce Commission, on the other hand has
formed a preliminary view that the benefits to the public from the
interim rules will outweigh any lessening of competition. However, it
will not issue a final opinion until after public hearings on January
18-19.

The rules govern the relationship between Electricity Corp. of New
Zealand (ECNZ), and Contact Energy, the new state-owned power firm
being created by splitting ECNZ. The market will be run by EMCO, the
Electricity Market Company, at present a joint venture of ECNZ,
TransPower (which operates the grid) and the Electricity Supply
Association of New Zealand. Contact is expected to buy part of ECNZ's
EMCO stake.

In a submission put to the Commission before it issued its preliminary
view, the Major Electricity Users Group (MEUG) says it is particularly
concerned that the anti-competitive aspects of the interim arrangements
will carry over into the final rules for the wholesale electricity
market. This group argues that the interim supply agreement and the
asset sale and purchase agreement between ECNZ and Contact preserve
ECNZ's existing level of dominance in the market.

MEUG disagrees that six months of trial is necessary. As there is no
certainty that these rates will flow through to become the final rules,
it suggests the market could invest time and skills in managing the
interim, only to find that experience had become redundant. It suggests
paper trials should be looked at as an alternative.

A different view has been put by the country's largest company,
Fletcher Challenge, which is both a user and a utilities investor. It
sees the proposed rules As a "practical method of moving forward" on an
interim basis. Like others, however, it insists they should only be
interim. It wants a "drop dead" clause before the date at which the
electricity from an independent power plant is due to be dispatched
because the rules provide no incentive for third party generation.

The Commerce Commission is considering the bridging pricing rules to
apply to two interim phases. The first runs to April 6 from the date of
settlement (probably February 1) at the sale of generating plant by the
ECNZ to Contact Energy. The major change during this period will be the
development of competition between Contact and ECNZ to run whichever is
the marginal power station.

In the second phase to end-September, the notified change in ECNZ's
energy supply contracts will be set on a day-ahead rather than a week-
ahead basis, the charge will be calculated using actual rather than
forecast demand and the actual price paid by power purchasers will be
calculated from the marginal cost of the last station used to meet
actual demand.

Arrangements for full competition after that have not yet been
finalised. Key features are expected to be that rather than ECNZ
forming contracts with its customers, generators and purchasers will
contract with a pool; purchasers will be for electricity; that day-
ahead price will reflect the market clearing price based on bids to buy
and offers to sell; that the cap on the price of electricity in force
up to end-September will disappear; and that generators and purchasers
will be able to contract outside the pool and to trade their position.

SAUDIA ARABIAN BUDGET

Saudia Arabia, the world's largest oil producer and exporter, has
announced its 1996 budget, which leaves expenditure unchanged from last
year at 150bn riyals ($40bn) but a slightly higher deficit of 18.5bn
riyals. The 1995 deficit has been estimated at 15bn riyals, but final
figures have not been announced. For the electricity sector, this
year's revenues and expenditures was put at 610.5m riyals. The sector
is involved in several multi-billion dollar power generation projects
involving high power equipment imports. Saudi produces 8m b/d, of which
7m b/d are exported. It is understood that Saudi planners will
calculate oil revenue for this year $14/bbl, unchanged from last year.

BP TO DEVELOP GAS RESERVES IN THE SAHARA

BP has struck a $3.5bn gas deal with Sonatrach and the Algerian
government to develop reserves deep in the Sahara. The deal will boost
BP's worldwide gas production by 30%. The site of the development is
near In Salah, deep in central Algeria and far distant from the civil
war. The joint venture will give BP access to the European gas market.
The venture will sell some 10bn cu. m of gas per year into southern
Europe via the Transmed pipeline into Italy and the under-construction
pipeline between Morocco and Spain. Sonatrach already exports 30bn cu.
m of gas, mainly via Italy.

John Browne, BP Exploration Director, said the deal was the first of
its type signed with Sonatrach, the sole gas producer in Algeria, for
the last 30 years. Under the deal BP will take 30% of the net after
expenses of the gas to be sold. Under a typical production-sharing
contract, the foreign oil company is likely to earn 15% of the net.
BP's favourable terms stems from Algeria's prolonged civil strife And
the high political risk.

Other companies are gathering round too. Exxon is starting talks on a
similar gas development deal. Ammar Makhloufi, the Energy Minister,
said the government would like to see two or three major projects
emerge in the In Salah area. Algeria is said to be anxious for US and
British involvement in the sector, now dominated by French and Italian
companies.  Other companies, such as Total and Repsol of France were
said to be in `negociation avancee' to develop a field, known as TFT
(Tin Fouye Tabankort), close to the Libyan border and several hundred
kilometres from the BP field., according to Al-Hayat newspaper. This
field is said to contain commercial quantities of natural gas (144bn
cu. m); LPG (15.6m tonnes) and condensates (16.6mt).

BANGLADESH GAS DISCOVERY

PetroBangla's subsidiary Bapex has made a `very significant' gas
discovery in the southern islands on the tip of the Bay of Bengal, the
first gas fiend in the area. The site is at Bhola, and the field will
increase the country's known reserves by 10%. Reserves at present are
10,000bn standard cubic feet, says Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, the
Energy Minister. The field will be Bangladesh's 18th commercial field

As part of its liberalisation, the government in 1993 offered several
of the country's 23 blocks for production-sharing. Domestic demand is
expected to rise eight-fold by 2020 to 5.5m cu. f/d. Among exploration
groups are Occidental, Cairns Energy and Holland Sea Search and Rexwood
Okland of the US.  Some 43% of the country's gas is used for the power
sector, 88% of which are gas-fired; 34% is used as feedstock to the
fertiliser industry.

VIETNAM OIL PRODUCTS IMPORT QUOTA

Vietnam's Ministry of Trade has set the oil products import quota for
1996 at 4.7mt, up from 4.5mt in 1995. The quota for crude and
condensates with a low paraffin content was set at 200,000t. The
ministry has allocated imports for diesel at 2.3mt, up from 1.04mt last
year; gasoline at 960,000t, up from 680,000t, fuel oil at 890,000t,
kerosene at 300,000t and aviation fuel at 250,000t. Vietnam's main
importer is Petrolimex, which was given a 3.1mt quota for oil products,
up from 2.8mt in 1995. Petrolimex's diesel quota was set at 1.47mt,
gasoline at 700,000t, fuel oil at 680,000t, kerosene at 150,000t and
jet fuel at 100,000t.

Last December, Petrolimex signed an annual term contract with Kuwait
Petroleum Corp to lift 500,000t of 1% sulphur diesel and 80,000t of jet
fuel starting this month. Petrolimex's remaining requirements will be
met through quarterly tender invitations and spot purchases. The
balance of imports will be handled by other companies, such as Petex,
Vietnam Airline Petroleum Co., and a new oil marketing firm,
PetroVietnam Oil Processing, Distribution and Marketing Co. (PVPDC).

of the US and South Korea's LG Group. The refinery will have a capacity
of 130,000 b/d and is located at Dung Quat Bay, 130 km south of Danang.
The three would replace Total, which withdrew from the project last
year. It had sought to build the refinery at Vung Tau in the south,
where most exploration is being done. Hassan declined to disclose
financial details of the deal.

PHILIPPINES OIL PRICE STABILISATION FUND

PNOC plans to inject Ps8.6bn in the depleted oil price stabilisation
fund, says Energy Secretary Francisco Viray. He said Ps5bn will be
released for the oil fund soon, but state-owned PNOC will have to find
other sources for the remaining balance of Ps3.6bn. The fund was set up
by the government in the 1980s to protect consumers from wild swings in
world oil prices and forex problems. Oil companies give money to the
fund if world oil prices are soft and if the peso is strong versus the
dollar, then draw against it if the opposite occurs.

With the rise in crude prices and a weakening of the peso, the fund has
been dwindling and a deficit of Ps7.6bn was reached by year-end. To
shore it up, the country's three main oil groups, Petron Corp,
Pilipinas Shell Petroleum; and Caltex Philippines have asked the
government to hike the price of oil products, which it did so last week
by three centavos per litre.

MALAYSIAN CONTROVERSY OVER OIL DISCOVERIES

Malaysia is embroiled in controversy as to whether it is preventing
foreign companies from bringing new oil discoveries into commercial
production. Petronas chairman Azizan Zainul Abidin denies that this is
so. "They (foreign oil majors) paid the risk money for exploration and
if they make a discovery and that discovery is commercial, there is no
way we can stop that." Petronas president Hassan Marican added that it
was not possible for Petronas to turn away development plans once a
contractor declares commerciality. But there is much grousing abroad,
with foreign oil company managers saying Petronas stalls the process by
bureaucratic foot dragging over approvals for budgets and field
development plans, including types of platforms, pipelines and other
technical issues. "Technically they are right, you can declare a field
commercial," said one manager. "And once you do that the clock starts
ticking on the lease."

Over the past decade, foreign oil groups have found 2.4bn bbl of oil
and equivalent gas in Malaysia, 20% of Malaysia's remaining recoverable
reserves,but none has been put into production, says Wood Mackenzie.
The 2.4bn bbl of new petroleum finds were discovered by 16 companies.
But since Malaysia offered its first production-sharing contracts to
foreign groups in the 1970s, only Shell and Esso, the original two
contractors, are in production. Of the 16, ten have closed their
offices in Malaysia. Under a standard production-sharing contract,
Petronas is entitled to 85% of all the oil produced, once the foreign
partner recovers costs. The terms are considered among the most
unfavourable to foreign partners. But analysts point out that
production costs are cheap, which is what makes the market reasonably
attractive.

CHINA SEEKING FOREIGN CAPITAL TO FUND OILFIELD

China's first joint venture investment bank, the China International
Capital Corp., is seeking Yn6bn ($750m) in foreign capital to fund the
further development of a large oilfield in Jilin province. The bank is
a venture between Morgan Stanley, China's Bank of Construction, and
smaller shareholders including Singapore Investment Corp. Cal Jinyong
told the Financial Times that the bank was sole financial adviser to
the Jilin development. Funds would be raised  in the next five years to
lift production at the field, where reserves are estimated at 170m
tonnes.  Planned output would be 2mt; CICC might take a small stake in
the venture, but wants large oil companies as equity partners. Morgans
has a 35% stake in CICC, the Bank of Construction 42.5% and the balance
is spread among the others.

ING Barings Bank says that Korea, rather than Japan, could play a
pivotal role in opening up Russian far eastern gas reserves. It is a
natural LNG market and lifts large amounts of LNG from the Middle East
and South East Asia. Far Eastern reserves would be virtually in its own
back garden and would give it greater diversity of supply. According to
the report, Seoul wants to boost relations with Russia and China and
would welcome a natural gas pipeline, which would be a symbol of

CLO CONCEDES ALL TO ENEL

Italy's industry minister Alberto Clo gave a year-end present to the
state electricity corporation. By putting his signature to the
controversial concession which licenses ENEL to operate, Clo has not
only taken the corporation a further step down the path to an initial
public offering of its shares, but also appears to have ensured that
privatisation will not significantly effect the comfortable status quo.

Clo's decision to sign the concession has not won universal approval,
however. Indeed some wonder whether a hidden agenda lies behind the
move of a non-elected minister in a technocrat government that seems to
be rapidly approaching the end of its time.

The haste with which Clo has despatched ENEL's operating concession
from his desk has not been well received by the anti-trust authority.
The competition watchdog's firmly held view is that Clo has put the
cart way ahead of the horse. How Italy's electricity sector should be
reorganised should have been settled before drafting and signing the
concession. But a new structure for the electricity industry requires
parliamentary approval and the industry minister, who may not be much
longer in that job, was not prepared to wait for the politicians to
have their say.

UNAPACE, the autoproducers' association chaired by Giuseppe Gatti, the
former energy director general at the ministry of industry who was
replaced last February shortly after Clo became minister, was wholly
opposed to the minister's precipitate action. In a note sent to the
minister in the week before Christmas, the association wrote,
"UNAPACE's fundamental position is that this concession should not be
signed, but that attention should be directed towards the necessary
legislative reforms".

According to the autoproducers, the concession that Clo has given to
ENEL introduces incurable contradictions with possible new structures
for the Italian electricity industry. The present system will remain a
straitjacket in which ENEL will continue to operate "not only in
monopoly conditions, but substantially as a government offshoot, with a
public-type role incompatible with real privatisation".

In its note, UNAPACE raised various objections to Clo's concession for
ENEL and suggested that:

* the exchange and transmission of electricity produced by other
companies must be made possible to all operators on equitable and non-
discriminatory conditions, on the basis of prices approved and
regulated by the regulatory authority;

* cogeneration should be encouraged as well as renewable sources;

* sub-concessions of ENEL's activities should not be limited to wholly-
owned ENEL subsidiaries or to companies owned jointly by ENEL and
public local utilities;

* the planning of plant capacity needed to satisfy national
requirements should be entrusted to a government body or the regulatory
authority, not to ENEL;

* competitive bidding for new generating plant should apply only for
capacity aimed at supplying the tied, mass market, while simple
authorisation should apply to capacity needed for supplying large,
'qualified' customers, distributors and consortia.

UNAPACE expressed particular concern over ownership and control of
Italy's grid. The autoproducers' association considers that, regardless
of EU decisions or recommendations, a separate grid company should be
established in order to ensure that the costs of transmission and
related activities should be made transparent and to reduce the
possibility of cross-subsidies between production and distribution.
"This company should be made completely autonomous and independent of
every other operator in production and distribution, particularly
ENEL", stated UNAPACE.

The association's note to Clo expressed concern that control of
activities so important to the system's functioning by a private
company could heavily condition access. This would "risk prejudicing to
a substantial extent the effect of liberalising sales to large
'qualified' consumers". UNAPACE told the minister that an alternative
to an independent grid company would be one in which independent
producers and distributors, public utilities and ENEL would have equity
stakes. "However, none should have a controlling interest in the
company."

On the question of grid access tariffs, UNAPACE said that these should
be detailed by type of service and directly correlated to relevant
costs. To guarantee transparency, the regulatory authority should be
responsible for tariff setting.

Clearly, while the operating concession may have brought some seasonal
good cheer to ENEL, Clo's signature on the document has disappointed
UNAPACE, and runs contrary to the ideas of Italy's competition
regulator.

The anti-trust authority gave its opinion in December, though this has
not yet been published, because, it says, it would be improper to make
known its opinion before the concession has appeared in the official
gazette. This is expected in mid-January. The anti-trust authority is,
however, unlikely to let go of an issue on which it has on several
occasions taken a stand wholly divergent from the line Clo has
followed. Italy's competition watchdog is, however, able to bark rather
than bite.

* The year has opened with speculation about who will be appointed to
the chairmanship of the regulatory authority for the electricity
industry. Among the names that have been mentioned is that of industry
minister himself, Alberto Clo.

If the technocrat government headed by Lamberto Dini is replaced or
reshuffled, Clo could be looking for a job. Being able to show a CV
that contains placing the law establishing the regulatory authority on
the statute book and the drafting and signing of ENEL's operating
concession might make him seem the right man for regulator. And, having
been regarded by some as ENEL's man at the ministry, he could then be
known as its man at the authority.

COMMISSION STRENGTHENS IEM RESOLVE

In an unprecedented move at the end of 1995, the European Commission
put forward its first white paper on energy. Basing its document on
three broad objectives - overall competitiveness, supply security and
environmental protection - the Commission said it will use all the laws
at its disposal to liberalise the EU's internal market for electricity
and gas. But it warned that new constitutional powers may be necessary
to reach that goal.

Unveiling the document, Energy Commissioner Christos Papoutis said: "If
we are to achieve all these objectives, the Commission must raise the
question of whether a modification of the Treaty of Rome is necessary,
as Community action I believe is now limited by the absence of clear
provisions."

He said a sound and sustainable energy policy "is critical for our
future economic development. This white paper will be our blueprint for
action into the 21st century."

The 40-page document lays down a programme for the next three years,
covering everything from vehicle emissions to promotion of
cogeneration. It also singles out completion of the EU's internal power
market and achievement of a level playing field for economic operators
in the sector as fundamental objectives.

For example, the paper says the EU needs a set of coherent criteria in
order to apply the Treaty's competition rules more effectively in cases
where public service supply obligations are involved. It also insists
that all forms of energy, including fossil and nuclear fuels, should
have a fair chance to compete, meaning more transparency in their
pricing and taxation is necessary.

"Energy prices, especially electricity prices, should not be used as
parafiscal instruments to support specific forms of energy, since this
will create distortions of competition unless such measures reflect
external factors", says the paper. However, it makes allowances for
support measures in favour of renewables. The Community's range of
instruments that govern the reporting of fuel prices "will be further
developed with a view to including taxation transparency," it observes.

At the same time, the Commission wants a more transparent business
environment for investments in the EU's energy sector and says it will
use the "appropriate tools" such as energy-impact analysis to assess
national regulatory measures in the environmental, social and tax
fields.

Of particular concern, it said, is a need to ensure that procurement
procedures for infrastructure projects "respect key criteria in terms
of transparency and objectivity." Brussels said it will push for
establishment of a new "Energy Consultative Committee" under its
auspices (consisting of representatives from industry and labour
unions) to ensure "as much transparency as possible on the development
of Community initiatives" in energy policy.

Creation of the EU's internal energy market and a multiplicity of
players within it is necessary, says the white paper, for further
diversification of the Union's domestic fuel base, particularly for
electricity production: "Electricity producers should be able to choose
the most appropriate and cost-effective fuel within a competitive
framework as long as it does not undermine diversification "

Thus, according to the white paper, it is difficult to justify a
continued application of the EU's Directive 75/404, which forbids use
of fuel oil under certain conditions for electricity production.
Overturning the directive, it says, "would give electricity producers
increased flexibility, [while] an adjustment of indirect taxation to
ensure equality of opportunity between substitutable fuels would favour
future flexibility in power generation".

In the same vein, the Commission will wage battle against the trend to
encourage intensive energy use across the union. "The evidence suggests
that there remains a substantial potential for improvement," observes
Brussels in its paper. It said EU bodies will have to "mobilise all
their instruments" to support energy efficiency. The Commission plans
to issue a communication later this year analysing how fiscal tools can
be used to promote energy efficiency and renewables.

The Commission will also issue proposals in 1996 to ensure that energy
efficiency is incorporated as an industrial requirement when European
technical standards are drawn up for energy-consuming equipment. It
wants the EU's technical standardisation bodies located in Brussels -
CEN and CENELEC - to create an energy working group to ensure that
their draft technical standards promote energy efficiency, renewable
energies and energy transportation. This could run into problems
however: such an approach will have to reconcile efficiency objectives
with trade freedom and sufficient flexibility for industrial
innovation.

Tipping its hat to the principle of subsidiarity, the Commission says
less direct intervention in the energy market will be the rule of the
day. But it argues that more efficient monitoring tools will be needed
to analyse the sector and ensure that its structural and technical
changes do not conflict with the EU's energy policy goals.

A reinforced monitoring capability is needed, says the paper, to:

* ensure the proper functioning of the internal energy market;

* verify that new production capacity enjoys freedom of establishment,
especially for independent electricity producers;

* enforce fair competitive conditions for independent electricity
producers;

* confirm that different network-access systems yield comparable market
opening and market access in member states;

* establish cooperation on interconnected systems between national
regulatory authorities in both the gas and electricity sectors.

The paper notes that the instruments currently at the Commission's
disposal for ensuring transparency of investments, prices and energy
imports and exports "are unsatisfactory because the administrative
burden is not offset by an operational usefulness."

Such ineffectiveness, it said, is linked to delays in the publication
of data and poor coordination between member states. To correct the
situation, Brussels is proposing to provide national administrations
with a new energy data bank as well as an information network that
processes data more quickly. At the same time, it will lobby for a more
"complete, reliable and harmonised statistical system" at Community
level in the field of energy.

How national capitals will react to such a broad range of initiatives
is still unclear. Most have fought tooth-and-nail against any
intrusion, direct or otherwise, by the Commission on the territory of
taxation. While Brussels can justifiably argue in favour of more
transparency in energy prices, it will probably meet resistance to
"improved monitoring tools" that peek too much into national taxation
regimes and decisions.

Moreover, its call for yet more consultative committees and working
groups may fall on unresponsive ears, considering that the Belgian
capital is already groaning under the weight of endless such
committees.

Perhaps in anticipation of the opposition that its energy policy paper
is sure to spark, the Commission ends its document with a bow to the
need for a proper division of work between EU and national authorities
- subsidiarity - but hedges its position nevertheless. The white paper
places energy policy "within the existing institutional framework" of
the EU. But it concludes saying the Commission will make proposals "on
the question of whether a modification of the Treaty in the 1996
intergovernmental conference is necessary" via a report to be released
in the coming months.

Do not expect any bold move, though. The Commission made a stab at
inscribing energy policy in the Rome Treaty during the previous
intergovernmental conference in Maastricht, and got a resolute slap on
the wrist.

WIJERS PROPOSES DRIVE TO PRIVATISE

The publication at the end of December of the Dutch government's long-
awaited energy policy document confirmed many of the details leaked
through the month (PiE 212/18). The main thrust of the Energie Nota is
that the government is to privatise 35% of the electricity market and
40% of the natural gas market "in the very near future". Within five
years, two-thirds of the country's energy market will be privatised.
The energy infrastructure, however, will remain in public ownership to
safeguard supply and optimal central production.

The policy paper was formally presented by economic affairs minister
Hans Wijers at the end of last month.

The other two goals highlighted in the document - which sets out the
government's vision for the energy sector for the coming 25 years - are
to increase energy efficiency by one-third by 2020 and boost the share
of electricity production from renewable sources from the current 1% to
10%.

The aim, said Wijers, is to stabilise CO2 emissions rather than strive
for a reduction. The minister said that although this was a departure
from existing policy (and contradicts statements by the environment
minister) it is more realistic approach.

He said it was meaningless for the Netherlands to impose stricter norms
unless these were adopted by the EU as a whole. And he added that the
stabilisation of emissions in itself calls for considerable effort
particularly as the country's economy is expected to grow at a rate of
2%/yr in the next 25 years. Unless measures outlined in his policy
document are implemented, energy consumption and CO2 emissions could
actually rise, he warned.

The government's plans concerning privatisation were, to a large
extent, unveiled in advance of the energy policy paper. The document
now outlines the timetable as follows: in the immediate future,
consumers who use more than 10 GWh of electricity or 10 MMcm of gas
will be free to choose their supplier.

They will be followed within five years by users of 50 MWh of
electricity or 170 Mcm gas. In fact, companies in this category will be
able to apply for so-called "non-binding" status before the legislation
is in place although they will have to give a period of notice to their
existing supplier.

Users falling under the specified volumes will remain tied to one
supplier with regulated tariffs. It remains to be seen when this
category of smaller (non-domestic) consumer will enjoy the same freedom
of choice as other commercial users, says Wijers.

The electricity market will also be open to new distributors, both
Dutch and foreign. But the grid will, says Wijers, remain in the hands
of the current owners (the central electricity generating board SEP).
This is the best way to safeguard supplies and ensure optimal central
production, insists the minister. But he adds that an appeal procedure
will be available for electricity suppliers who feel they are unfairly
handled. This "natural monopoly" will also have an independent
watchdog.

Wijers claims that his proposals will place the Netherlands at the
forefront of energy market liberalisation in Europe, along with Britain
and the Scandinavian countries.

Concessions

According to major users, however, the plans fail to meet conditions
for increased competition in the market. Vereniging Krachtwerktuigen,
the association of large-scale users, which account for 80% of
commercial consumption, has urged economic affairs minister Hans Wijers
to focus more on opening up distribution to provide a counterweight to
his proposals to concentrate production.

Wijers' estimate that the reforms will deliver a cost saving of Dfl 500-
600m ($312-375m) is fine, but electricity users can only be sure they
are getting the lowest possible price when there are sufficient
alternative sources of power, a spokesman for the association said.

He said there are too few guarantees that new suppliers would have
access to the national grid under the same conditions as the central
electricity board producers and distributors.

Wijers' plan for an independent watchdog to ensure that every producer
will be treated equally is too vague and open-ended, the association
says, adding that free trade outside the sector will be obstructed by
established players.

Distributors could charge such high fees that it becomes impossible for
independent producers to make money from supplying customers via the
national grid.

While acknowledging the need for a powerful producer to enable the
Dutch energy sector to compete in a liberalised European market, the
association doubts that the plans will stimulate competition from
abroad and from independent producers as envisaged by Wijers. The only
way to achieve this is to give the electricity sector a fully
independent legal and economic status, it concluded.

The proposals contained in the policy document also indicate a
significant concession on the part of the minister on two points. The
first concerns his plans to merge the four existing producers (UNA,
EPZ, EPON, EZH) to create a single electricity production company with
distributors as shareholders. Wijers said this was necessary because
conflict between regional and national interests has led to over
capacity and operational inefficiencies.

The merger proposal caused an uproar (PiE 213/1) and the wording in the
policy document now calls for "one large-scale production company"
which leaves the option open for one or more breakaway production
companies to operate.

This could be the case in the south where the regional producer EPZ and
three local distributors PNEM, NUON and Deltan are already involved in
a far-reaching co-operation agreement. They have calculated that the
formation of a national electricity giant would result in extra costs
of Dfl 265m ($164.4m) for consumers in one province (Noord Brabant)
alone. Larger users would have to pay 25% more for electricity while
smaller customers would see a rise of 13%, they claim.

In the east, distributor NUON also prefers regional integration and
opposes the idea of "its" producer EPON being swallowed up by a
"bureaucratic monopoly".

Nevertheless, the move towards the integration of the production sector
will, says the policy document, have priority and energy director-
general Dessens has since said the outline of the new company will be
completed this year. A merger of all four producers would create a
concern with an annual turnover of Dfl 6bn.

Wijers has warned that reluctant shareholders may be forced to co-
operate with the government's merger plans, although he would prefer to
reach agreements with the parties involved.

Wijers argues that a large production company would benefit from
economies of scale, ensure more compatibility in terms of supply and
demand and - perhaps most importantly - would put the Netherlands in a
better position to compete with foreign producers once the EU
liberalises the electricity sector.

The second concession relates to the shareholding of the new production
company and is aimed specifically at appeasing Amsterdam city council.
The council is currently a shareholder (33%) in its regional production
company UNA but would have to sell its stake to a distributor under the
original proposals, something which it objects strongly to. Now Wijers
has said local authorities can also be direct shareholders in the
national producer.

Wijers' policy paper allocates Dfl 6m a year for a wide package of
energy efficiency measures for electricity generated by fossil-fired
plants. These include more long-term agreements with industrial sectors
and stricter standards for new buildings. Investment is needed because
"simple solutions will be exhausted by 2000" said the minister.

TAXING TIMES FOR NORWAY

The minority Labour government's plan to change the way generating
utilities are taxed is facing mounting hostility from some of the
affected interests.

The keenest criticism is being voiced by the so-called "hydro power
kommunes", local authorities which derive much of their tax revenues
from hydro plants located within their borders. LVK, the national
association of hydro power kommunes, called an extraordinary meeting on
January 10 to discuss the proposals, which it claims will undermine
local authority taxation rights and hit the country's sparsely
populated rural districts. A day earlier the opposition Centre
(Farmers') Party, which traditionally stands up for rural areas, held a
seminar on the tax reform. One of its conclusions was that the measure
was an "attack" on these areas. Media reports predict that LVK will
mobilise "massive opposition" to its approval by the Storting
(parliament).

The draft bill containing the proposed changes was tabled by the
finance ministry on December 15 (PiE 214/21). Initial reactions to it -
by all concerned - were moderate. This was mainly because the ministry
forecast, in the text of the bill, that the hydro power kommunes would
actually see their revenues from the sector rise under the new regime.
Since then, however, LVK has been doing its own sums to see how
specific local authorities would be affected. It claims that these
contradict the official figures.

In a letter to the ministry, LVK director Arvid Lillehauge says that
"... so far [our calculations] indicate that it is impossible to reach
the result indicated by the draft bill. On the contrary our
calculations show a fall in local authority tax revenues of such
magnitude that it does not accord ... with the intentions of the bill".

Lillehauge's request for the background material on which the official
calculations were based has been refused by the ministry, which says
that this material was collected on the understanding that details
would remain confidential.

The main changes proposed by the draft bill are:

* abolition of wealth tax on publicly-owned power utilities (private
companies - including privately owned power plants - have been exempted
from paying wealth tax since the general tax reform of 1992. Treating
publicly and privately-owned power companies in the same way, the
ministry points out, will have the advantage of eliminating an
incentive to privatise publicly-owned power undertakings for tax
reasons.)

* a switch from assessment on the basis of estimated value to
assessment on the basis of [annual] accounts, where publicly-owned
power utilities are concerned. That means, says the ministry, that the
latter will pay tax on profit, like other enterprises, and not tax on
the basis of estimated value as at present.

* abolition of tax exemption for power utilities in the kommunes which
own them. This will effect, inter alia, local authority-owned
distributing activity, which, recalls the ministry, is "to a great
extent ... exempt from tax at present".

* introduction of a 30% tax on the "ground rent" arising from power
production, with the central government and the counties receiving,
respectively, 95% and 5% of the take from this tax. Ground rent is
defined by the ministry as "the return on a natural resource over and
above a normal return... it is proposed to protect the normal return by
calculating an annual free income, which may be deducted from the
ground rent income".

* abolition of the present state production tax, which will be replaced
by the tax on the ground rent.

* the fixing of a minimum level for income tax [payable] to local
authorities (tax on hydro power income). "Hydro power income", says the
ministry, "is to be calculated separately for each individual power
plant for both publicly and privately [owned plants] as a proportion of
an estimated gross income. The aim of hydro power income is to ensure a
minimum level of stability in the income tax [take] of the hydro power
kommunes. It is proposed that hydro power income should be set at 35%
of the estimated gross income."

FOOTING THE NUCLEAR BILL

City lore has it that if the price is right you can sell anything.
Apply this to the UK's viable nuclear industry stripped of its Magnox
park, and the right price is obtained by prudently discounting a number
of factors - liabilities first, political and regulatory instability
next, perhaps public antipathy last. You are left with a business worth
considerably less than its newest, most prized asset, Sizewell B, which
cost #2.5bn.

Crudely put, this is the message coming from analysts, unions and
academics studying the government's plans to privatise Nuclear Electric
and Scottish Nuclear's merged AGR/PWR business as British Energy.
Public enthusiasm for the proposal, never high, has been diminished by
a perceived volte face by the government on its pledge to abolish the
Nuclear Levy on privatisation. The government's position is far from
stable; defections to opposing parties and a shrinking majority may yet
force it to take a more circumspect line on potentially divisive policy
decisions. Nevertheless, privatisation of nuclear and the railways
remain on the agenda.

With this as background, the Commons Trade and Industry Select
Committee investigating the nuclear proposal (PiE 213/4) is due to
report its findings on February 1. Among the most significant
contributions to the committee is a report* commissioned by Friends of
the Earth and the anti-nuclear local authority grouping COLA. It
suggests the government will be tempted to retain the #3bn ($4.658bn)
cost of reprocessing spent AGR fuel presently residing in the cooling
ponds of Sellafield to ensure the AGR/PWR business fetches something
like the #2.6bn value it has placed on it.

The report's authors, Gordon MacKerron of the Science Policy Research
Unit (SPRU) at Sussex University and Mike Sadnicki, a consultant, state
that such a scheme, while superficially attractive, is unsatisfactory
and possibly illegal under European Commission state aid rules.

Provisions in BE assets

The argument that the reprocessing costs constitute a historical legacy
and have nothing to do with the operation of a new company is
fallacious, the report says; "There are provisions in the accounts of
NE and SN of some #3.5bn to cover these liabilities for reprocessing
AGR fuel irradiated to 1995, and these provisions have in principle
been invested in the assets which British Energy will acquire. In other
words the assets contain the provisions for paying for the inherited
spent fuel. To exempt BE from the need to pay for them would be to
allow the company to enjoy the future incomes from the assets while
escaping a major liability which those assets are designed to pay for."

Exemption would result in the total public sector fund necessary to
assure payment of all liabilities growing from #7.8bn (the report's
estimated figure for a Magnox decom fund) to #10.35bn. This possibility
comes on top of regulator Stephen Littlechild's disclosure on December
19 that, despite perceived government promises to the contrary, the
Nuclear Levy will continue after privatisation in order to recover
around #450m of revenue arrears.

The announcement caused outcry from the Labour party, which branded the
government's promise of an 8% reduction in electricity bills "an
extravagance the government clearly can't afford to pay for".
Littlechild said the government had stated the levy would cease on
privatisation "subject to the recovery of outstanding arrears". The
Levy will remain at 10% on English and Welsh electricity bills from
April 1 1996 until privatisation, when a reduction in the rate is
anticipated. Energy minister Tim Eggar said power bills should fall by
6% by autumn 1996.

#809 million o.n.o.

So what value does the report put on BE's worth with all liabilities
factored in? MacKerron and Sadnicki's conventional base case using a 2%
discount rate on liabilities (the rate which the industry itself has
applied in the past) and a 13% discount rate on operational costs
values the company at -#2.6bn. Using a 13% discount rate on liabilities
and present costs - nearer the rate private investors are likely to use
when evaluating costs - the sale value is #809m.

The above cases have of necessity been partly based on statistical
assumptions given the shortage of operational data in the public
domain. BE itself is unable to comment in detail under the Financial
Services Act but was quoted as saying it would rather be judged on its
track record; indeed the report acknowledges the improvement in AGR
performance and Sizewell B's consistent operation at full power.
Neither is the report anti-privatisation per se; it concludes that if
it works well, the electricity market would be completed, some
liabilities would be transferred to the private sector and some cash
raised for the taxpayer. Analysts welcomed the attempt to detail the
industry's value but observers conceded there is as yet not enough core
data for the prudent investor.

If the approximations are at all accurate, the maximisation of the sale
value for nuclear power will almost certainly not correspond to the
division between Magnox and AGRs/PWR, the report continues. Assuming a
price of 2.5p/kWh, Heysham 2's estimated cash cost of 2.07p/kWh makes
it eminently privatisable. AGRs at Dungeness B and Hunterston B
(2.79p/kWh estimate) are not. "Quite probably a combination of Heysham
1 and 2, Torness, Sizewell B (and possibly Wylfa among the Magnox)
could all make money in the private sector, whereas Dungeness B,
Hartlepool, Hinkley Power B and Hunterston B might not", the report
says.

Add in the report's estimated 0.29p/kWh contribution to the independent
trust fund covering AGR decommissioning (PiE 213/5), and British Energy
is left with even fewer viable power stations. Of course, MacKerron and
Sadnicki could be wildly off the mark. After all, the report was partly
paid for by anti-nuclear pressure groups, as BE points out. SPRU,
however, has been near the mark in the past on the viability of new PWR
build and the desirability of a segregated decom fund.

AUSTRIAN ENERGY TAXES

The sudden change in finance ministers will delay but not derail plans
to introduce an energy (CO2) tax on electricity, gas and coal.
Regardless of the government's make up after the mid-December
elections, both the social democrats and conservative Volkspartei
favour extending the energy levy beyond motor fuels, taxed since last
May.

No one pretends any longer than the resultant funds would be applied to
CO2 reduction as originally intended; rather, the income would help
overcome a drastic budget deficit. Arguments have been flying over the
amount of tax to be levied (PiE 210/10) and this will be an ongoing
debate between the two parties as they attempt to reform the coalition
which came undone over budget issues last October. The conservatives
can be counted upon to hold back social democratic moves for a tax at
the higher end of the proposed scale, to avoid making Austria less
attractive for industry.

Coalition negotiations come first, but the energy tax could be a part
of the ultimate package. Nevertheless, given that formation of a new
government is not expected until the end of at least February,
introduction of the tax on electricity probably will not occur before
mid-year at the earliest.

OKA TO BE PARTIALLY PRIVATISED

Oberosterreich Kraftwerke AG (OKA) will be partially privatised this
year, according to the Upper Austrian provincial governor. Currently
the utility - which supplies the industrial centres of Linz and Steyr
as well as substantial agricultural areas with its own as well as
Verbund power - is wholly-owned by the province and, in addition, has a
36% holding in the Salzburg regional utility Salzburger AG fur
Energiewirtschaft (SAFE; PiE 192/12).

No date or procedure has been set for OKA privatisation, but any
arrangement is likely to include a condition which would avoid
shareholding by a German electricity utility: earlier moves to
partially privatise the Salzburg regional and municipal utilities
stumbled when a German purchase was feared. German utilities such as
Bayernwerk have made no secret of their interest in obtaining
transmission right-of-way across Austria, which would enable cheaper
electricity exchange between Germany and Italy.

Meanwhile, OKA has set major rationalisation and investment programmes
for the short-term future. Following a study by consultant AT Kearney,
OKA will reduce personnel from 2,410 to 2,000 through attrition.

Administration will be cut sharply, departments reduced from 60 to 38
and, local offices from 75 to 40. Savings in personnel costs over the
next six years are estimated in the "three figure millions", according
to management, with a Sch800m ($79.1m) cost reduction by 2001.

Growth, meanwhile, is expected from new business areas. The utility
will invest some Sch1.5bn in 1996, Sch1.1bn in plant and equipment, the
remainder in participation investments. The current major plant
investment is in the disputed Lambach generating facility (PiE 213/12).

REGULATION OF ELECTRICITY TARIFFS

The time-consuming procedures for altering electricity tariffs have
been simplified as of the start of this year. The new arrangement (PiE
211/12) allows utilities to institute tariff changes following
notification of the ministry for the economy. Detailed figures
supporting the change must be publicised and the adjustment justified.

The new regulation puts a cap on the amount of any increase and still
allows intervention by interest groups in Austria's "social
partnership" (labour, industry, agriculture) if the adjustments are
judged unwarranted. A 12% "deduction" from the gross increase is
required on the grounds that this amount must be achieved by the
utilities themselves through rationalisation. No increase may exceed
half of the then-current inflation rate.

For the arrangement to apply, individual utilities must agree to abide
by the new regulations. All nine of the country's regional utilities
plus the major municipal utilities have subscribed to the rules
governing the new procedure, but the responses of about 180 small
privately-owned electricity suppliers remains open.

The new arrangement has been criticised by the country's greens,
amongst others, who say the procedure gives utilities no more
initiative to introduce real cost-cutting or efficiencies, nor does it
subject tariff increases to the same scrutiny as did the previous
system.

RESULTS FROM THE FEDERAL VERBUND

High water flows through hydro plants and a 3% increase in electricity
consumption have assured a good year in 1995 for the federal Verbund.
The authority nevertheless has noted the impact of two major
cogeneration plants which have come on-line, measurably trimming
industrial electricity usage.

On the financial side, the Verbund last year experienced unbudgeted
costs of some Sch400m-500m ($39.6m-49.4m) when its long-term borrowings
in Swiss francs had to be revalued to reflect exchange rate
differences. About a fifth of Verbund bonds or Sch10bn are denominated
in francs. Notwithstanding, the Verbund will again pay its (49%)
private shareholders a 16% dividend based on the nominal Sch100 share
face value: this amounts to a 2.6% return relative to the year-end
market price of Sch606 per share. The government as 51% shareholder
will receive an 8% dividend on its stake, or half the private
shareholders' return.

No detailed export-import figures have been released, but the Verbund
notes an export surplus in its electricity trading for 1995. Higher
sales to Germany, Slovenia, Croatia and Hungary have been registered,
although in part these have been achieved at below-cost prices in order
to reduce untenable coal stockpiles (PiE 214/14). Exports to Eastern
Europe made a profit of Sch500m last year, according to management.

Faced with a surplus of electricity as well as generating capacity, the
Verbund has succeeded in cancelling import contracts with the Ukraine,
postponing for another year an exchange contract with Russia and
suspending for five years a 500 GWh contract with Bayernwerk which was
to have come into effect last October. Verbund director Johannes
Sereinig estimates that these moves will save the federal authority
some Sch300-350m annually. At the same time, however, the Verbund has
been unsuccessful in negotiating changes to its 20-year 1,200 GWh
supply contract with Hungary (PiE 213/12) and has begun importing
unwanted and expensive electricity under the terms of the 1986 deal.

VERBUND PARTICIPATION IN RETAIL MARKETS

Regional utilities which have opposed federal Verbund participation in
their retail markets will not be comforted by recent statements by
Verbund director Hans Haider.

"Our direction heads toward heavier participation in the regional
utilities", Haider stated, underlining that the Verbund will "seek to
secure the market" rather than allow intrusion by powerful German
utilities.

"Were Bayernwerk last year to have acquired a holding in Kelag
[regional utility], we'd also now have them in [the generating utility]
Drauwerke", Haider argues. Kelag has a 49% holding in Drauwerke;
intervention by the Verbund last year pre-empted a bid by Bayernwerk
for a controlling holding in Kelag (PiE 185/11).

Next on the Verbund shopping list is STEWEAG, the regional utility
sharing supply to Styria, which could be partially privatised once
ownership in the provincially-owned concern is transferred to a holding
group. The Verbund already controls STEG, the other utility serving the
province, which it acquired in 1992 from Swiss owners (PiE 138/9) in
the face of strong protest from STEWEAG and other regional utilities.

While the Verbund sees greater involvement in Styria as bringing
considerable potential for efficiency, other regional utilities fear
that the federal organisation is seeking to ensure its future at their
expense while protecting itself against divestiture under EU rules of
its import-export and transmission grid monopolies. Haider has
justified wider Verbund shareholding in regional utilities on grounds
that this assures Austrian control over energy polices.

SALE OF SHARES IN VIW CHALLENGED

The sale of shares in Vorarlberger Illwerke (VIW) by the federal
government to the province of Vorarlberg has been challenged by Swiss
minority (4.5%) shareholder Finelectra. The Swiss concern asserts that
the deal between Vorarlberg and the Ministry of Finance for transfer of
user rights to VIW's high-voltage transmission lines (PiE 207/11) is
illegal as it was not put to shareholders.

Vorarlberg officials have registered surprise at the suit since talks
were held with Finelectra shortly before conclusion of the purchase
deal. Details of the Swiss charge are not known, but the challenge has
been dismissed by Vorarlberg's provincial governor as having no
significance.

AUSTRIAN UTILITIES TO ESTABLISH TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK

Austrian electricity utilities have pledged to band together to
establish a ground-based telecommunications network. The decision
follows the failure of either of the consortia in which they had an
interest (PiE 213/12) to win the single mobile telecoms license award.

Both Energieversorgung Niederosterreich (EVN) and the federal Verbund
had been reasonably certain that consortia in which they were
participants would gain the mobile telephone license. Both lost, with
the franchise going instead to a group supported mainly by the German
DeTe Mobil concern, Siemens Austria and the Austrian bank BAWAG.

The electricity utilities now plan to concentrate on development of
their fixed-based facilities with transmission via glass fibre cables
suspended from their high-voltage distribution pylons, in anticipation
of the anticipated telecoms liberalisation in 1998.

SLUMP IN POWER CONSUMPTION IN BELGIUM

Preliminary figures released by the Belgian federation of electricity
producers and distributors (FEB) show a slump in power consumption in
Belgium in 1995 from September, reflecting the wider cooling in
Europe's economy. Net power consumption in the country grew by an
estimated 2.9% last year compared to growth of 4.9% in 1994, said FEB.
In volume terms, net consumption in 1995 was 69,821 GWh versus 67,822
GWh in 1994.

Most of the slowdown was attributed to plunging demand from industry.
Though demand for energy from the sector remained strong during the
first half of the year (5.4%), it tapered off sharply after the summer,
leading to growth in industrial consumption for the year as a whole of
3.7%, or slightly less than in 1994. Demand from Belgium's domestic
sector grew by a moderate 2.0% last year, while its tertiary (services)
sector saw consumption grow by 2.4%.

Net production rose by 3%, from 68,563 GWh in 1994 to 70,605 GWh last
year, according to FEB. As usual, Belgium's private sector accounted
for the overwhelming share of production: 64,943 GWh or nearly 92% of
the total. Public utilities accounted for 4.2%, while the balance of
3.8% came from auto-producers.

Nuclear energy was the largest fuel source, generating 39,063 GWh last
year or 55.3% of total power production. This was followed by solid
fuels (22.9%), natural gas and gas derivatives (17.8%), liquid fuels
(1.5%), hydro-power (1.8%) and recovered steam (0.7%).

Belgium's fuel mix for electricity produced in 1995 saw the greatest
changes in the natural gas and liquid fuel categories. Use of natural
gas and derivatives last year to produce electricity, for example, shot
up by 19.4% compared to 1994. Indeed, according to the country's gas
federation, sales of natural gas to Belgium's power sector ballooned by
20.9% from 70,151 TJ in 1994 to 84,800 TJ last year.

Though its absolute share is minuscule, power derived from recovered
steam rose 18.9% compared to 1994 (523 GWh vs 440 GWh). Nuclear energy
saw its share in total production rise slightly by 1.4%, reversing the
trend of recent years. Liquid fuels and wind power fell sharply (22.6%
and 11.1%, respectively).

Separately, FEB said the sector imported a total of 9,416 GWh from
France, Luxembourg and Holland last year and exported a total of 5,307
GWh, leaving a net balance of imported power of 4,109 GWh. Belgium had
a net balance of imports of 3,983 GWh in 1994.

One gas-fired co-generation unit of 51 MW was put into service at Ham,
near Ghent, in 1995 while a scattering of small steam-power units went
into service at Brugges (0.44 MW), Bressoux (3 0.9 MW units), Deurne
(0.76 MW), Harelbeke (0.165 MW) Middelkerke (0.165 MW) and at Wanze
(0.23 MW and 0.31 MW). As part of Belgium's current ten year (1988-
1998) plan, two 350 MW gas-fired co-generation stations will be put
into service at Ghent and Brugges in 1997.

The country's next equipment plan for the 1995-2005 period, which was
given final government approval on December 20, places even greater
accent on natural gas-fired stations. It also calls for a reduction in
the growth of demand for electricity of 0.9% for the coming year and
lower tariffs, starting in the second trimester of 1996.

FEB said Belgium's electricity grid expanded modestly in most
categories: 0.5 km for 220 kV lines, 3.3 km for 150 kV lines and 15.8
km for 70 kV lines, including 13.8 km of cable. Total capital
investments in production, transport and distribution activities was
Bfr 35.6bn($1.205bn) or nearly 17% more than in 1994 (Bfr 30.5bn).
Electricity prices during the year rose with inflation, or by
approximately 1.5%.

DANISH CHP REPORT

Elsam's recent report to the Danish Energy Council - Integrated
Resource Planning - struck a far from sanguine note. It claims Denmark
is heading towards a major imbalance between electricity production and
consumption. Elsam reckons that 40% of the power produced by wind
turbines and CHP units in 1998 will be superfluous to local consumer
requirements. The company predicts that Danish electricity oversupply
will reach a massive 1,000 GW in four year's time.

Elsam lays the blame with what it calls a "too rapid and uncontrolled
development of CHP" in Denmark. After a heated and very public argument
between the Danish energy minister, Svend Auken, and Elsam in the weeks
leading up to Christmas, Elsam agreed to accept power from 64 new small
decentralised CHP units. When completed, they will have a combined
capacity of 1,225 MW, or about one-fourth of Elsam's entire capacity at
present.

The Danish Energy Council (controlled by the energy ministry) believes
there is scope for 1,500 MW of CHP-produced electricity in the region.
Elsam insists there is no need to build a single new CHP unit before
2003 at the earliest, and says that state operating support for CHP -
Dkr 0.10/kWh ($0.018) and 30% capital construction grants - has
encouraged far too many investors.

Politicians and Elsam have been at odds about the small decentralised
power plants since parliament first decided to promote them vigorously
towards the end of the 1980s. The decision was made on the basis of
several reports which suggested that CHP and biofuel formed the most
eco-friendly solution to Denmark's electricity needs. However, their
opponents now claim that a major disadvantage with CHP is that there is
no central dispatch system co-ordinating them. Electricity production
by CHP is dictated by the need for heat and this means they produce at
full capacity in the winter months while the larger centrally-placed
power plants are forced to cut back on production.

One result of the CHP argument is the resumption of the debate on
connecting Denmark's two separate East and West grids. In 1992
parliament urged Elsam and its Eastern Denmark counterpart, Elkraft, to
work towards establishing a cable to join their grids. As yet, however,
the plan has come to nothing. New calculations on the economic
viability of the plan show that income derived from inter-regional
electricity sales would only meet the ordinary operating costs of a new
cable.

Income would thus be insufficient to pay the estimated Dkr90m interest
associated with the capital costs of the project. However, energy
minister Svend Auken has requested the Energy Council to undertake an
additional assessment of the project. He accepts that the capital costs
would be high, but "it would be a once-off investment which would give
us a great advantage in the coming European energy market", he
concluded. On a more up-beat note, the Elsam reports says it expects to
achieve its targeted CO2 emission reduction five years earlier than the
government had anticipated.

According to the government's energy policy law Energy 2000, Danish
power producers must cut total CO2 emissions to a maximum of 24m tons
per annum by 2005. Elsam claims western Denmark's targeted 14m tons can
be achieved as early as 2000.

ELECTRICITY INTERCONNECTIONS BETWEEN ITALY AND GREECE

The European Commission is setting aside more than Ecu 75m ($98.1m) to
improve electricity interconnections between Italy and Greece. The
grant, approved on January 11, will be financed from the EU's Regional
Funds and forms part of the "INTERREG II" programme.

The lion's share of the money - Ecu55.772m - goes to Greece, with the
balance of Ecu20m for Italy. It will be used to strengthen power
distribution links between the two countries, notably between the 400
kW electricity supply networks that link Arachthos in Greece to
Galatina in Italy.

Two AC to DC conversion stations will be built, along with a line to
carry direct current to connect the two stations. The money will also
fund the installation of a 160 km underwater cable to carry 600 MW
between Oporto Badisco in Italy and the Greek town of Aetos.

ENERGY TAXES

The Commission approved on December 20 a set of Dutch fiscal measures
designed to encourage energy savings and a reduction of CO2 emissions.
The centrepiece of the legislation is an energy tax on small-scale
energy consumers.

The tax will be levied on consumption of the first 50,000 kWh of
electricity and the first 170,000 cubic metres of natural gas. Only
small-scale energy consumers - mainly households and small businesses -
are subject to the tax.

The revenues will be channelled back to taxpayers via a reduction in
direct taxes on capital and labour income, thus constituting a "tax
neutral" mechanism. Large-scale electricity users are exempt from the
tax, as other measures apply to them. Similarly, Holland's
"horticulture under glass" - ie, its sizeable agricultural and flower-
growing sector - is exempt from the tax on gas consumption in order to
maintain its competitive footing internationally.

The Dutch government says its will amend its legislation if a common,
EU-wide CO2/energy tax is introduced.

CGT CALLS FOR FRESH ACTION

The French CGT (Confederation Generale du Travail) trade union called
on its members at Electricite de France (EdF)-Gaz de France (GdF) to
undertake fresh action on January 9 and 11. The latest protests were
aimed at the decision to hold back salary increases this year to 0.7%.

The government has issued instructions to all state-owned firms, as
well as official bodies to hold salaries back in line with an official
target of 2% for inflation. All that EdF-GdF has so far promised its
workforce is an end of year bonus which will increase pay by 0.7% from
1995 levels.

Earlier this year, the CGT was trying to relaunch general protests
aimed at preserving "public service" and the state employees' slightly
privileged pension systems, which were interrupted by a truce over
Christmas. This met with very little support. According to management
figures, no more than 1% or 2% of the utilities' employees backed them;
the four other main unions - FO, CFDT, CGC, and CFTC - did not support
the protests. They were content with the pension guarantees that they
had obtained, and with the delay that had been imposed on liberalising
Europe's power supply system.

* EdF is to pay the state a dividend of Ffr1.5bn for 1995, while Gaz de
France is to pay Ffr970m, according to figures published in the
official journal.

FRENCH WINDPOWER PILOT PROGRAMME

A working group on renewable energy sources has proposed that the
French government buy between 250 MW-500 MW of wind turbine generators
to connect to the grid.  The proposal is being considered by the
government.

Director of energy and raw materials at the industry ministry, Claude
Mandil, noted that ADEME (Agence de l'Environnement et de la Maitrise
de l'Energie), as well as the turbine manufacturers wanted to install
500 MW by 2005, while Electricite de France would prefer 250 MW with a
first tranche of 50 MW.

He added that wind turbines had made considerable technical progress in
recent years and were becoming increasingly competitive.

A committee of experts would supervise the proposed pilot programme.
Tenders would be carried out in stages, allowing the project managers
to benefit from experience in the preceding rounds. Operators would
probably be asked to tender on the basis of the electricity purchase
price that EdF would have to offer to make their proposal viable.

LA MANCHE NUCLEAR WASTE DUMP

France's environment ministry has confirmed that an independent
scientific commission is being set up to supervise the La Manche
nuclear waste dump near La Hague.

Activity at the centre has been in abeyance since November 30, when the
appeal court in Caen ruled that it must be stopped. The court was faced
with a plea by ecological groups arguing that the site was not
functioning properly. The court is due to rule on January 31 whether on
work at the centre can resume.

ANDRA, the nuclear waste agency which manages the site, stopped
stocking additional materials in 1994, and had almost finished covering
the site - with a view to monitoring it for 300 years - when the court
order to stop intervened.

FUEL CONSUMPTION IN ITALIAN POWER STATIONS

Figures for fuel consumption in Italian power stations in the first
nine months of last year show increased gross thermal production, 8.9%
higher at 143,203 GWh than in the comparable 1994 period, compensating
for the 12.0% fall in hydro production to 31,920 GWh.

While gross production from coal increased sharply by 30.7% to 17,444
GWh, it, nevertheless, only provided 12.2% of total gross thermal
production. Fuel oil continued to dominate the Italian scene. Although
gross production from fuel oil increased by a modest 2.3%, from 83,341
GWh in the first nine months of 1994 to 85,265 GWh in the same period
last year, it accounted for 59.5% of gross thermal production.

Natural gas maintained its clear second place, recording an advance of
15.8% in gross production to 33,917 GWh, equivalent to 23.7% of total
gross thermal production. Other fuels used in Italy's thermal power
plant provided gross production of 6,577 GWh during January to
September last year, an increase of 19.2% on 1994 and equivalent to
4.6% of the total.

In terms of consumption, Italy's thermal power plants burnt 18.38mt of
fuel oil between January and September last year (up 2.8% on the same
period of 1994), 8.27 Bcm of natural gas (plus 19.1%) and 5.95mt of
imported coal (plus 28.8%). The statistics show that there was no
consumption of indigenous coal.

State corporation ENEL raised its international profile over Christmas
by providing 300 kW illumination modules for lighting the holy places
in Bethlehem.

Following an approach from the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO),
ENEL decided that equipment from its 'Luce per l'Arte' programme should
be made available to light up the Basilica of the Nativity, the grotto
and the walls of Bethlehem's square. The illumination project ran from
Christmas Eve until January 8, the date of the Islamic new year. In the
season of goodwill, ENEL hopes that its Bethlehem illumination project
will help to bring some business to its international project workload.

The corporation has had discussions with the PLO about electrification
work in the former Israeli occupied territories, and will try to use
the presence of its 'Luce per l'Arte' modules in Bethlehem as a lever
to keep the door open for a successful Palestinian crusade by its
engineering division.

The marketing possibilities of other 'Luce per l'Arte' initiatives
undertaken by ENEL over Christmas and the new year are less obvious.
Since the autumn, the Vittorio Emanuele monument in the capital's
Piazza Venezia has been floodlit by ENEL's modules, and at the other
end of the Via del Corso, the Piazza del Popolo was specially
illuminated for New Year's eve festivities. At the beginning December,
a tailor-made 35 kW fixed but programmable lighting system comprising
259 lamps was switched on in the Basilica of Santa Maria in Trastevere.
Thanks to ENEL's intervention, visitors are now better able to
appreciate the basilica's XIIIth century mosaics and XVIIth century
ceiling.

Earlier this week, the buildings in the Campidoglio capitoline hill
area of the capital and the nearby Roman fori were illuminated by ENEL
for ceremonies inaugurating the start of Italy's European Union
presidency. Perhaps ENEL, whose privatisation plans have earnt
criticism from the Brussels competition authorities, wanted to cock a
snook at the Commission's chairman Jacques Santer and his commissioner
colleagues who were in Rome. Or, by bringing a sparkle to the capital,
the state electricity corporation may have been offering thanks to
Lamberto Dini's government which has allowed ENEL to avoid the
privatisation upheavals that would have been likely under a less
complaisant government.

EDF WITH EDISON PURCHASE 75% OF ISE

Continuing its international acquisitions, Electricite de France (EdF)
has completed the purchase of 75% of the Italian electricity producer
Ilva Servizi Energie (ISE), in partnership with Edison. The two firms
paid L370bn ($233m) for their stake, which will be held through a joint
company called Finel, in which Edison has 60% and EdF 40%. The deal was
agreed conditionally at the beginning of 1995, but the conditions were
not met until towards the end of last year.

EdF commented that this was an important step in developing
collaborations with other power generators in countries which wanted to
encourage independent electricity producers.

ISE already has capacity of some 600 MW, including a thermal power
station at Taranto (in Puglia), two at Piombino (in Tuscany), and a
hydro power plant at Terni (in Umbria). In addition, ISE is building a
500 MW thermal power station at Taranto, which will be fired with gases
from the blast furnaces of the local steelworks.  It will use combined
cycles to generate both electricity, which will be sold to ENEL, and
steam, which will be used by the steelworks. The project is due to come
into operation in the second half of 1996.

DEMAND FOR ELECTRICITY IN THE NETHERLANDS

Demand for electricity in the Netherlands peaked at an all time high of
11,160 MW on December 20 last year, but overall demand of 70 TWh was
down 0.4% or 300 GWh on 1994, according to provisional figures from
SEP, the Dutch central electricity generating board.

SEP said the 1995 peak was 3.3% higher than the previous year's figure
and the first time demand passed the 11 GW mark.

SEP supplied 90% of the power provided through the national grid, with
the remaining 10% coming from combined heat/power plants owned by
industry and energy distributors.

SEP generators produced 2% less electricity last year, reflecting a
rise in power imports, which accounted for 17% of SEP's output compared
to 15% in 1994. At the same time, SEP exports increased four-fold to
320 GWh in 1995 from 75 GWh in 1994.

The steady advance in the share of power generated from coal continued
last year, climbing to 45% from 42% in 1994 and 37% in 1993, SEP said.
The share of natural gas declined further, to 49% from 525 in 1994 and
57% in 1993. Nuclear power accounted for 6% of production, the same as
in previous years.

SEP's total production capacity fell to 14,44 MW last year, 590 MW down
on 1994. Heat supplies from power stations expanded by 1% to 13,997 TJ
in 1995 from 13,773 TJ a year earlier.

SEP said the fuel component in the national basic tariff (LBT) had been
fixed at DFl 0.052 ($0.032) per kWh for daytime production and DFl
0.044 for night-time production for the first quarter of this year. The
night-time tariff is DFl 0.001 lower than in the last quarter of 1995,
while the daytime rate is unchanged.

PNEM SIGNS AGREEMENT WITH WINDFARMERS

Southern Dutch energy distributor PNEM has signed a ten-year agreement
with Windfarmers BV in Moerdijk for the supply of electricity for its
Green Power scheme under which customers can opt to buy electricity
generated from renewable sources (PiE 201/15). Windfarmers will build
four wind turbines, each with a capacity of 1 MW, which will deliver a
total of around 6 GWh of power annually, starting in March next year.

PNEM was the first company to introduce the Green Power programme in
the Netherlands and has won 2,500 clients since the scheme was launched
in June. The company hopes to increase this to 10,000 by the end of
next year.

Customers currently pay Dfl 0.085 ($0.053) more per kWh for
electricity, but this will drop to around Dfl 0.05 when the new eco tax
is introduced on January 1 according to the government's proposals.

* PNEM has announced a Dfl 0.0024 price rise for its conventional
electricity to Dfl 0.1912 (up Dfl0.0047 to Dfl 0.2382 for peak periods
ie 07.00-21.00).

NORWEGIAN-SWEDISH POWER BOURSE

The difference between Norwegian and Swedish power prices has been
shrinking since the Norwegian-Swedish power bourse began functioning on
January 1 - creating what is claimed to be the world's first
international power bourse (PiE 212/20).

From that day, Swedish traders have been able to buy and sell on the
market - operated by Statnett Marked and located at Lysaker, on the
outskirts of Oslo - regardless of whether their companies have the
physical infrastructure needed to import and export electricity between
the two countries. Previously, this was a condition of their being
allowed to do business there.

On January 2, the first working day of the year, 20 Swedish players
traded on the market, according to Hans Randen, a director of Statnett
Marked. This compared to only nine before the new year. January 1,
moreover, saw the abolition of border tariffs charged on power
exchanges between the two countries. Power exchanges between Norway and
Finland and Norway and Denmark are still subject to these tariffs;
apart from this, however, Finnish and Danish traders can operate on the
bourse under the same terms as the Swedes and Norwegians. "We expect
that most of the trade will take place in the day market, and that this
will lead to increased liquidity", Randen told the Oslo business daily
Dagens Naeringsliv.

He predicted that by the end of the year there would be some 40-50
Swedish players dealing on the joint bourse, in addition to the
approximately 100 Norwegians already using it. According to Per Hjorth,
managing director of Statnett Marked, the latter include around 40
generating utilities, 40 distributing utilities, eight to ten
industrial companies and ten brokers.

Power volumes traded via Statnett Marked rose to some 38 TWh in 1995,
from 28 TWh in 1994. Average annual output capacity in Norway is 112
TWh.

"I believe we shall reach 50 TWh this year, and much of the volume
growth will of course be due to the new joint market with Sweden", said
Randen.

PRIVATISATION OF ELECTRICIDADE DE PORTUGAL

Officials of Portugal's new Socialist government have indicated changes
in the way Electricidade de Portugal (EdP) is to be privatised. But
apparent contradictions in their announcements remain to be clarified.
Economics Minister Daniel Bessa told a Lisbon newspaper the first step
in privatising the group would involve finding major institutional
investors willing to buy up to 50% of an initial offer.

Secretary of State for Energy Jose Penedos was quoted as saying the
government plans a gradual privatisation of the group as a whole,
rather than in parts, and intends to disperse the capital widely. He
said this would help stimulate capital markets and make the purchase of
shares more accessible to Portuguese investors.

The previous centre-right government had planned to privatise up to 49%
of Companhia Portuguesa de Producao Electrica (CPPE), the production
arm of the EdP group, and subsequently sell up to 49% of the country's
four regional distribution companies. Penedos said the limit would
remain at 49%. More details are expected when the government presents
its overall privatisation programme, due towards the end of January.

The new government also plans to change the regulatory system for the
power sector approved in mid-1995, making the regulatory body set up
for the industry responsible for energy issues as a whole, not just for
the electricity sector. Penedos said the scope for government
intervention in the regulation of the energy sector would also be
reduced but gave no further details. In particular, the new government
wants the regulatory body to cover natural gas, due to be introduced in
Portugal by 1997.

Meanwhile, EdP has announced price cuts for industrial and commercial
users of 5%-8% in nominal terms in 1996. Taking account of expected
inflation, this represents a reduction in real terms of 8.5%-11.5%,
says EDP. Prices are to be 5% lower during peak hours and 8% lower at
other times. Prices for domestic consumers will be held flat in nominal
terms in 1996. EdP also forecasts its 1995 profits will double from
1994's Es30.5bn ($203.9m).

HEAVY RAIN FILLS PORTUGAL'S HYDRO-ELECTRIC DAMS

Weeks of heavy rain after five years of drought have filled Portugal's
hydro-electric dams to the extent that production has had to be halted
at several plants. All five hydro units on the Douro river in the
north, the country's most important source of hydro power, were shut
down in mid-January because the dams were too full to produce the
required fall of water to drive the turbines that produce energy.
However, annual production was expected to be above average in 1996
after current high water levels subsided.

More than half of Portugal's 64 dams were reported full and some were
discharging water to reduce excess capacity. All but four of the 24
hydroelectric dams belonging to Rede Electrica Nacional, the state-
owned national power grid operator, were full.

Three people died in accidents as parts of Lisbon and other regions
were flooded in the second week of January. The Tagus river overflowed
its banks in the area of Santarem 80 kms north of Lisbon. Portuguese
authorities were monitoring the river upstream in Spain, concerned that
the heavy rains could force Spanish reservoirs to discharge water,
aggravating Portugal's difficulties.

Officials said Portugal's five years of drought were over but the
ability to meet irrigation requirements fully next spring would depend
on rainfall in January and February. Rainfall in the southern Alentejo
region over the past two months was more than in the previous four
years and risks of flooding continued in several regions of Portugal.

SPAIN'S 1996 ELECTRICITY TARIFFS FROZEN

Spain's 1996 electricity tariffs have been frozen for the first time
since 1973. The utilities' association Unesa said the tariff freeze was
"the electricity sector's contribution to the stability of the economy
and the general price index," although Unesa chairman Martin Gonzalez
del Valle said that the tariff had fallen 10.7% in real terms since the
Stable Legal Framework (MLE) was first approved in 1984.

The MLE allows the utilities to factor certain costs - such as asset
costs, some overheads and hydroelectric generation costs - into their
tariff rates.

The December 28 decree which set the 1996 tariff also modified the MLE
in order to cut the utilities' income by Pta29.2bn ($241.3m), or 1.42%
of the tariff, but this will be made up by making other adjustments
according to interest and exchange rates.

The industry ministry's MLE modifications are broadly in line with
those proposed in November by the regulatory body, the National
Electricity Commission (CSEN), which wants to see more competition in
the sector.

The tariff increase has been below inflation for the past five years -
in 1995 it rose an average of 1.48% on inflation an estimated 3.5%.
this year's inflation forecast is also 3.5%. Unesa said on January 5
that between 1959 and 1995 the average price of electricity had fallen
by 39% in comparison with the consumer price index rise over the same
35 year period.

Days earlier, European commissioner for competition Karel van Miert had
told the European Parliament's Foreign Economic Relations Commission
that Spain's electricity tariffs were the highest in the EU.

The industry ministry has also bowed to consumer groups' pressure and
agreed to a new electricity bill which for the first time will contain
information on the client's consumption over the past 12 months, the
average cost per day in that period, as well as the percentage paid
from the bill for domestic coal subsidies, and to subsidise the
utilities' nuclear moratorium debt.

The latter two, being fixed rates, penalise higher consumption. The
1996 percentages, based on the estimated 1995 tariff turnover of Pta2
trillion and a forecast 1996 growth of 3.65% are the same as in 1995 -
3.54% or Pta72.6bn in nuclear moratorium debt, and 4.86% or Pta99.8bn
in coal subsidies.

Unesa said the new invoice model is designed to separate the direct
production costs - supply, generation and maintenance - from the
external and political costs such as the nuclear debt and subsidies.

Announcing the MLE changes, industry minister Juan Manuel Eguiagaray
said the electricity sector would not have to make investments in new
generation until at least 2000. But he said some fuel oil-fired power
stations would be converted to gas. "By February we shall authorise the
conversion to gas of fuel-oil stations with a capacity of 1,400 MW."

ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION IN SPAIN

Industry association Unesa's provisional figures show that electricity
consumption increased by 3.8% in 1995. High-tension industrial
consumption grew by almost 6%, consumption in services and commerce was
up by 2%, while domestic demand fell by 1.5%.

Total consumption last year was 149,834 GWh, while generation was up
2.6% at 168,686 GWh. The fourth year of the century's worst drought
meant that hydroelectric generation fell by 16.8% at 23,968 GWh,
although it shot up in the last two weeks of the year as Spain
experienced almost constant rain from November. Unesa estimates that
the drought resulted in hydro generation at 30% lower than in normal
conditions, costing the utilities more than Pta50bn ($413.2m) in lost
production.

Thermal generation rose by 11.1% over 1994 to reach 89,276 GWh, which
Unesa said was an all-time high, while nuclear generation was up by
0.2% at 55,442 GWh. Spain increased its imports from France by 250%,
and total imports stood at 7,623 GWh, while exports were 3,145 GWh.
Together, imports and exports rose by 143.6%.

BASQUE PLANS TO ACHIEVE ENERGY SELF-SUFFICIENCY

The Basque regional government in northern Spain has warned that it is
"very seriously" studying plans to develop an independent gas-fired
electricity system if the industry ministry in Madrid continues to
block its plan to achieve energy self-sufficiency.

In an interview with the financial daily Expansion, Basque industry
minister Javier Retegi reminded Madrid that the existence of
independent operators outside the integrated electricity system is
enshrined in the government's own year-old Electricity Sector Law
(Losen), even though certain regulatory norms have not been fully
developed.

Retegi's comments are bound to increase tension between the Basque
capital Vitoria and Madrid, which opposes much of the Basque project
such as the conversion of the unfinished Lemoniz nuclear power station
into a combined cycle plant on the grounds that Spain does not
currently need new energy sources.

Euskadi (Basque Country) retorts that it wants self-sufficiency because
it feels that it is at the end of the 'energy line' in the far north,
and it wants to diversify its sources of primary energy, mainly gas. It
is no secret that the Basque nationalists who control the regional
government want energy autonomy as well as political autonomy.

Ironically, the development of independent operations outside the
integrated system is very much in line with the government's plans to
introduce greater liberalisation and competition in the sector. The
problem is that the Basque energy plan is in contrast with the industry
ministry's national plans.

Under the Basque government's Estrategia Energetica de Euskadi, or Plan
3E, the Basque Country would generate 42% of its own electricity by
2000. At the moment, it 'imports' 85% of this energy from outside the
region. Retegi claims that 10% of electricity is lost in transport.

"Our goal of electricity self-sufficiency is quite reasonable", he
says. "We are already negotiating with various foreign companies who
specialise in gas, electricity and independent systems, such as Enron
and Mitsubishi."

Basque energy independence would be based on four gas-fired electricity
generation stations, only one of which is currently on-line. This is
the 360 MW Santurtzi fuel-oil plant which would be converted to
combined cycle operation.

The uncompleted Lemoniz nuclear plant would be converted into a 300 MW
combined cycle plant. Construction was halted in 1982 after ETA
separatist gunmen killed two engineers at the plant, two years before
Spain's nuclear construction moratorium came into effect.

A further two gas-fired generators are to be built - Zabalgarbi, two 90
MW units, and Zergarbi, with a single 90 MW unit.

Retegi said natural gas consumption would rise from the current 15% to
29% of total primary energy use by 2000, which would mean building a
regasification plant in Bilbao port and connection to the French gas
network. "the interconnection between gas and electricity obliges us to
develop a global energy scenario", he says.

"If we had a good understanding with central Administration to achieve
greater self-sufficiency, to use Lemoniz and to guarantee [alternative]
gas supplies, everything would be in order and it would not be
necessary to seek alternatives to the integrated system", concluded
Retegi.

months ahead of schedule. The Grupo Enher, which with Hidruna includes
Termicos del Besos, is now complete and in 1995 had a combined turnover
in excess of Pta200bn ($1.7bn).

Iberdrola agreed to sell Hidruna to Endesa through Enher in a 1993
asset-swap, but the remaining 30% was to have been acquired in two
stages by March 1997. The Pta21.7bn deal was brought forward because of
the healthy situation of both Enher and Hidruna.

THIRD WIND FARM AT TARIFA

A third wind farm has been commissioned at Spain's wind power capital
of Tarifa in the far south. The Pta1bn ($8.3m) farm was built by Planta
Eolica Europea (Peesa), a group led by Danish company Nordtank (44%),
Danish engineering firm Elsam Project (44%), and Spain's Sevillana de
Electricidad (12%). The farm's 12 x 500 kW air turbines have a combined
installed capacity of 6 MW.

Sevillana is active in all three wind farms, which have a combined
capacity of 66 MW. It holds 23% of Sociedad Eolica de Andalucia, and 9%
of kW Tarifa.

Spain could be the world's second wind power producer by 2000,
according to energy secretary general Alberta Lafuente who was
presenting the four-year Pta16bn energy research Plan Estela, which
will investigate all areas of energy generation.

The industry ministry announced that the capacity of all renewable
energies had increased by 80% in the past five years in Spain and
stands at 407 MW. Including hydro generation, renewable energies
accounted for 5% of the national total. Oil accounts for 54%, coal for
19%, nuclear power 15%, and gas 7%. Although wind power has increased
tenfold since 1990, it still accounts for only 0.2% of renewable energy
and 0.01% of all energy generated.

SPAIN'S NUCLEAR MORATORIUM DEBT

The government has finally approved a Royal Decree that will solve the
problem of the Pta729bn ($6.02bn) nuclear moratorium debt. The debt has
been borne by three utilities since construction was frozen in 1984 on
five nuclear power stations in Spain, one year after the Electricity
Sector Law (Losen) incorporated the means to clear the debt.

Losen enshrined the right of Iberdrola (Pta540bn), Sevillana de
Electricidad (Pta178bn) and Union Fenosa (Pta11bn) to receive
compensation for their investments in the plants either through a 3.54%
share of the tariff, with the debt paid off within 25 years, or the
right to pass on to investors the chance to gain the compensation in
the form of securities.

The decree ensures that the State gives a triple guarantee to the
utilities or, in their place, the investors. First, a minimum annual
compensation is guaranteed via the utilities' turnover; second, the
state will make up any difference remaining after 25 years; and third,
the state guarantees to cover the interests incurred by the debts.

* Union Fenosa has reduced its financial debt by Pta30.7bn to
Pta507.4bn. Some 19.3% of this is in foreign reserves, lower than the
average for the sector.

ENDESA AND SEVILLANA PULLING OUT OF CERSA

Public utility Endesa and its associate Sevillana de Electricidad have
made a joint announcement with Gas Natural that they are pulling out of
Spain's third largest telephone paging company, Compania Europea de
Radiobusqueda (Cersa), in which each holds a 9% stake.

Endesa and Sevillana have also broken ranks with Spain's largest
private utility Iberdrola by leaving the telecommunications holding
company Secomtel that they formed in the late 1980s. Iberdrola, which
holds 16% of Cersa signalled its intention to stay in the
telecommunications sector by announcing plans to purchase 40-50% of the
Internet connection company Servicom.

The three utilities have operated in telephone paging since 1992
through the consortium Servicio de Radiotelefonia Movil (SRM), which
holds 96% of Cersa. Secomtel's shares will be divided between SRM and
another mobile telephone company, Teletrunk.

The main reasons for the break-up are the different strategies being
undertaken by Endesa - which has joined forces with Banco Santander and
Banco Central Hispano - and Iberdrola, which appears to be moving
toward an alliance with semi-public telecommunications giant
Telefonica.

Endesa and Sevillana are also moving out of SRM/Cersa for economic
reasons. The late arrival of the paging service in Spain meant that
three large operators with important investors emerged in 1992 just as
the more successful mobile telephone sector was taking off.

This meant that Cersa, with 25,000 clients, lost Pta420m ($3.5m) last
year. A leading contender to purchase the 27% of SRM shares on offer is
Sistelcom-Telemensaje, a consortium which includes two other utilities,
Union Fenosa and Fecsa.

AUTOPRODUCTION IN SWITZERLAND

Autoproducers in Switzerland will continue to benefit from federal
tariff recommendations until end-1998. These have been in force since
mid-1993, have now been extended until the end of 1998. As Switzerland
has few industrial autoproducers, the scheme mainly benefits small
hydro producers and gas-fired CHP plant in buildings.

According to an Evaluation Report just published, 80% of small hydro
plant (less than 300 kW) surveyed have seen the prices paid for their
energy rise and profitability improve since the recommendations took
effect. The federal recommendations are applied "almost entirely" by
electricity companies in eight cantons, but are followed only partly in
nine cantons, and entirely ignored in the principal hydro-producing
cantons of Graubunden, Ticino and Valais.

Here the difference between the production cost of about Sfr0.04/kWh
($0.035/kWh) and the Sfr0.16/kWh recommended for autoproducers is just
too great. The authors of the report claim that a promotion of
decentralised energy production is a national objective, which does not
justify forcing the three "hydro cantons" to accept conditions which
would result in unfair local tariff increases.

The five remaining cantons (Geneva, Neuchatel, St Gallen, Schwyz and
Aargau) provided no information to the evaluators.

The report noted that participating cantons have asked for the creation
of a national fund to finance the extra cost of the scheme to
distribution companies. The report recommended increasing tariffs paid
to CHP operators by 20-50% (solar producers have long been campaigning
for such a rate increase). It noted that in cases where more than 30%
of the energy produced by a CHP unit was consumed on the premises, the
reward for supplying excess energy to the grid was not sufficient to
make CHP attractive to investors. This meant that while the trend to
multiplication of CHP in buildings and heating grids continued, it
received no extra boost from the tariff recommendations.

The report also pointed to disputes over whether or not the
recommendations should apply to an independent autoproducer's total
output or just amounts in excess of own needs. Finally, it recommended
renaming the recommendations as federal "directives" to make them seem
more consequential.

Responding to the report, Martin Renggli, who heads the Federal Energy
Office (FEO) policy service, told PiE that:

Efforts will continue to be made to use the tariffs to promote small
hydro plant, even though technically many are not "autoproducers". He
said there is unlikely to be any question of increasing the tariffs
paid to CHP operators producing from fossil fuel (gas), in view of
parliament's insistence that such measures target renewables, and not
fossil fuels.

He noted that the legislation clearly intends that the special tariff
applies only to excess production. Thus, to avoid unfair profiteering,
independent producers must use the energy themselves as far as
technically possible. A leaflet is currently being prepared to make
this absolutely clear.

Despite another of the report's recommendations, he said there will be
no change in the "5% rule" which requires the REC to pay when
autoproducer input exceeds 5% of a local distributor's total energy
supply.

On the financial points, he noted the Sfr0.16 average tariff paid to
autoproducers who use renewable energy sources is the equivalent of the
long-term marginal production cost. Meanwhile, as the idea of a tariff
fund was broadly opposed during an earlier consultation period for the
new Energy Law, it is unlikely to be considered now.

Switzerland is virtually the only country to apply such a tariff and
the biggest electric companies have not really embraced the
recommendation. According to the report, the amount they "reinject"
from autoproducers is a "minute" 0.2-1.3% of total energy turnover, or
just 0.5-0.7% of costs.

SWISS REGIONAL ELECTRIC COMPANIES TO FREEZE TARIFFS

Five major regional electric companies have agreed to freeze tariffs
for the next three years. The five companies are BKW, NOK, Atel, CKW
and EOS. Announcing the agreement, the ombudsman's office in Berne said
it was made possible by the RECs' "good, and in some cases very good,
1994 results".

Joseph Deiss, one of the members of the ombudsman's team, told PiE that
the announcement was not really the result of a general "agreement" but
rather of separate negotiations with each REC. It was the ombudsman who
had taken the initiative, on the assumption that the excellent 1994-95
results announced by these companies, and the very good hydro
conditions, should benefit the consumer.

Deiss pointed out that as there are over 1,200 electricity companies in
Switzerland, the office had chosen to deal only with the big players on
the assumption that the effect will trickle down. "Our objective is to
reverse the trend of the many recent tariff increase, in excess of the
rate of inflation and at a time when there is an abundance of energy on
the market. We are pleased with our success."

RESULTS FROM CKW GROUP

Switzerland's CKW Group had total energy turnover of Sfr480m ($417m),
an increase of Sfr33.6m improving the Group net profit by Sfr6.3m to
Sfr25m. This was obtained with the help of a 5% tariff increase in
October of 1994, a demand increase in the CKW distribution grid of
5.2%, and to a slight improvement in prices for energy sold on the
international spot market.

Carl Mugglin, chairman of the board of directors, told a January press
conference that CKW would not increase tariffs in 1996, thus giving
"voluntary support to the price ombudsman's efforts to stabilise
tariffs".

Mugglin repeated warnings about the danger of further increases in the
production cost of Swiss electricity, and particularly
hydroelectricity, due to various new taxes. CKW and other Swiss
electric companies have decided to abandon any major new hydro projects
in the near future, such as the Mauvoisin dam.

CKW's profit-and-loss account for 1994/95 amounted to Sfr551.4m.
Operating expenditure was Sfr428.1m. Total investments, in plant and
for drawing rights, were Sfr81.7m. The dividend will be unchanged at 8%
(Sfr40 per Sfr500 share).

Production increased 7.3% and energy from increased use of drawing
rights by 45%. The Leibstadt and Gosgen nuclear reactors supplied 7.6%
more power, due to greater efficiency. CKW's own nuclear production
amounted to 874 GWh, with another 466 GWh from drawing rights.

Nuclear generation accounted for two thirds of the energy supplied to
CKW's grid. The total cost of production increased almost Sfr23m to
Sfr270m. Total demand in the CKW Group distribution grids to 2,400 GWh,
up 4.8%. Total CKW Group energy turnover was 4,300 GWh, up 7.1%.

Demand in the CKW company's distribution grid increased 5.2%, thanks
mainly to a 13.7% increase in demand by three major accounts, and a
4.3% increase in demand by "general industry", indicating a strong
recovery in the Lucerne region's economy. The household/trade/
agriculture/services sector showed a demand increase of just 1.1%.

TURKEY NEEDS 183 POWER STATIONS TO MEET PROJECTED DEMAND

Turkey will have to build a total of 183 power stations over the next
15 years costing around $16bn to meet projected soaring demand,
according to a report compiled by the country's Energy & Natural
Resources Ministry. The report says generating capacity must increase
at around 8% over the period to 43,590 MW from 15,235 MW at end-1995 to
serve a rise in demand to 271,450 GWh from 94,605 GWh at present.

In particular, the report says that a power bottleneck could emerge in
1997, unless existing projects are completed on schedule, no existing
power plants are closed down for environmental reasons, and there is no
shortage in gas supply or upgraded lignite.

To prevent shortages, construction work should also start on planned
build-operate-transfer (BOT) schemes as soon as possible, the report
adds. And state-owned Turkish Electricity Generation & Transmission
Corp (TEAS) should install a sufficient amount of shunt capacitors in
all power distribution systems operating at ratings of 34.5 kV or
below.

The demand forecast is based on rapid population growth, rising living
standards and industrial expansion. Per capital consumption is
projected to rise to 3,267 kWh in 2010 from 1,978 kWh, for example.

The power stations required break down into 106 hydro-electric
stations, 16 thermal plants and two nuclear stations. Further thermal
stations will also be required: 33 lignite or hard coal fired stations,
14 natural-gas fuelled plants and 12 stations fuelled by imported steam
coal.

The present nominal capacity is 20,857 MW, but due to ageing, effective
capacity is only 73% of this figure. The report therefore also says
rehabilitation and modernisation of existing plants will also be
essential.

Because of the high investment costs, foreign financing and capital
investment will be essential, according to the report. The government
will look to the private sector franchise, BOT method as one answer, as
well as the privatisation of existing units requiring updating and
expansion, the report adds.

Contracts so far signed on a BOT basis involve projects with a total
capacity of around 3,710 MW, including two gas-fired plants of around
500 MW each at Eregli on the Sea of Marmara, and a 180 MW plant at
Esenyurt in an Istanbul suburb. Also included is the 672 MW Birecik dam
scheme on the Euphrates river in the southeast, says the report.

Bids were also invited by the ministry for the BOT implementation of
the following plants: Beysehir-Konya (2 x 170 MW); Saray-Tekirdag (2 x
150 MW), Afsin Elbistan (4 x 340 MW), Tufanbeyli (2 x 150 MW, or 1 x
300 MW).

Generally, the report foresees:

* commissioning of the first natural gas-fired plant with a rating of
680 MW in 1996;

* start-up of the fifth and sixth units at the Afsin-Elbistan lignite
plant, each with a rating of 340 MW;

* start-up of the first hydro-electric plant in 2000;

* commissioning of the first nuclear plant with a rating of 1,000 MW in
2005;

* start-up of the first imported coal fired station with a rating of 2
x 500 MW as well in 2005.

* In a separate development, the ministry reckons there is a potential
in Turkey for 30% energy savings annually amounting to 13.2m toe
equivalent or $2.6bn, based on 1994 production and consumption figures.
Had electricity been generated and consumed in the most productive way,
savings would have amounted in the construction sectors and industry
generally to 5.3m toe, or around $1.2bn each; and in the transportation
sector, 2.8m toe, or $262m.

MISSION ENERGY ACQUIRES FIRST HYDRO

Mission Energy of the US has joined Eastern Group at the head of the
independent generator league after its #652.5m ($1.01bn) acquisition on
December 21 of First Hydro, the National Grid's former pumped storage
business.

First Hydro's two plants in North Wales have a combined capacity of
2,088 MW, adding to Mission's 80% holding in the 220 MW Roosecote CCGT
in the northwest and a 33% interest in Derwent Cogeneration Limited, a
214 MW plant in Derby. The final price was considerably in excess of
the #450m value put on the business in NGC's flotation prospectus.

The two stations give Mission a key role in ensuring the security of
supply in England and Wales, particularly in winter when Dinorwic and
Ffestiniog frequently set the pool price. Mission has indicated the
size of the bid - #325/kW - was made possible by its favourable tax
position; it will also have taken into account increasing price
differentials in recent price spikes (PiE 214/28). Its bid topped those
of two others, Scottish Hydro-Electric and Dominion Energy of the US.

Mission and Eastern Group, along with Enron and Applied Power Systems,
are bidding for National Power's (NP's) 4 GW of capacity (PiE 212/24).
James Iaco, Mission's senior vice-president, said the First Hydro deal
made the company keener to win the auction for the three NP coal-fired
stations.

The 12 regional electricity companies who owned First Hydro after it
had demerged from the Grid stated on December 28 that they would retain
the proceeds from the sale. They will, however, have to pay capital
gains tax on their profits.

LITTLECHILD PUBLISHES MODIFICATIONS TO LICENCES

Regulator Stephen Littlechild has published his proposed modifications
to the licences of South Western Electricity (SWEB) and Eastern Group
following their respective takeovers by Southern Electric International
and Hanson.

The modifications, already agreed by Southern and Hanson, deal with
financial ring-fencing of the electricity businesses, restrictions on
activities, availability of resources, disposal of assets and provision
of information to the regulator. The modifications will be applied to
other merged companies in due course.

Littlechild said: "the merged companies will continue to have to meet
their existing obligations under the Electricity Act and licences.
These additional licence modifications will allow me to continue to
regulate effectively and to ensure that customers continue to be fully
protected."

Meanwhile, Ian Lang, President of the Board of Trade, in early January
cleared the proposed #1.6bn southeastern distributor Seeboard by Dallas
utility Central & South West (CSW; PiE 212/25). The bid will not now be
referred to the Monopolies & Mergers Commission, as were the bids by
local generators National Power for Southern Electric and PowerGen for
Midlands (PiE 213/9).

CSW's offer went unconditional the day after the clearance. Unusually,
all executive directors of Seeboard will retain their positions, while
chairman Keith Stuart and six non-executive directors resigned. Jim
Ellis will combine the role of chairman with his current position of
chief executive.

The clearance of Welsh Water's #880m agreed bid for South Wales
Electricity (SWALEC; PiE 214/28), meanwhile, is not proving quite as
smooth. The Office of Fair Trading has delayed its ruling on the bid -
the second by a privatised UK water firm for a privatised UK
distributor - until January 25.

The bid prospects clouded further in early January as Welsh Water
rejected a proposal by the water regulator Ian Byatt that it maintain a
separate stock market listing for the companies following any takeover.
This proposal was believed to be the main condition in a clearance of
the deal by both water and electricity regulators, both of whom are
concerned to retain sufficient comparators to regulate their respective
industries.

However, Welsh Water, noting that North West Water (NWW) was not
required to maintain separate listing prior to clearance of its bid for
Norweb (PiE 211/25), claimed a separate listing would make efficient
management of the new group difficult. The company is continuing
discussions and says it will seek alternative ways to meet Byatt's
objectives.

* The merged NWW and Norweb were merged into a new holding company,
United Utilities, on January 1. The combined group will have a turnover
of over #2.5bn and is capitalised at over #3bn. The companies will
continue to trade under their former names.

NATIONAL POWER TO CUT 400 JOBS

National Power (NP) has announced it is to cut 400 jobs in a cost-
cutting exercise that is expected to save #100m ($155.3m) over two
years from its #1.4bn annual costs. The redundancies will come from
support divisions  in its Swindon headquarters, and equate to about a
third of its headquarters staff and almost 10% of its total 4,900.

Most of the cost savings, however, are expected to come from reviews of
business processes, with some #35m as a result of property
rationalisation.

NP said the review was sparked by the increasing competition in the
electricity market, and was the result partly of its enforced sale of
4,000 MW of coal plant, which is expected to be agreed by March (PiE
209/2).

NP has already cut its workforce by over two-thirds from the 16,000
staff it had at privatisation in 1991.

The move follows the company's mid-December buy back of a further 57m
shares, or 4.4% of its issued capital. The buyback, at a cost of #243m,
would increase gearing by 9 percentage points, said the company, but
would boost earnings per share by 2-3% in a full year.

* The company's finances may also be assisted by a surprising #300m
loan awarded in late December by the European Investment Bank for the
installation of flue gas desulphurisation equipment at its 3,750 MW
Drax coal-fired plant in Yorkshire.

NP, which applied for the loan several years ago, is due to complete
the so far self-financed #750m work on Drax this year.

VENEZUELAN FLOTATIONS EXPECTED BY SUMMER

The Venezuelan government has set out target dates for the
privatisation of its electricity sector, which it plans to start this
summer and extend through 1997.

Potential investors looking for a widely-spread flotation with the
potential for a large shareholding by the investing public will be
disappointed because the government's intention, at least at this
stage, is to place the bulk of power generation in the hands of a
single private sector investor or joint venture. Indications are that a
minority portion of shares will be more widely sold.

The initial piece of the sector to be placed on the market will be the
Margarita Island utility, which comprises a 146 MW power plant and a
100 MW submarine cable, as well as transmission and distribution
networks.

The regional utility has 90,000 subscribers, a high, 92% bill
collection ratio, and forecasts a demand rise of 8%-10% per year. The
utility, serving a resort area, is 15 miles off the coast.

The privatisation programme, disclosed by officials in Caracas, was
further explained in statements by Luis Xavier Grisanti, Director of
the Fondo de Inversiones de Venezuela (FIV), the state holding company
that is overseeing the unbundling process. FIV has $10bn of assets,
half of which are in the power sector (Enelven-Enelco and Enelbar).

According to officials, the state plans to sell Enelbar (Energia
Electrica de Barquisimeto), Enelven (Energia Electrica de Venezuela)
and Enelco (Energia Electrica de la Costa Oriental), and to follow this
- at an as-yet undisclosed date - by the sale of the Planto Centro
thermal power generator. FIV owns 99% of the shares in these three
companies. Planto Central is more problematical, being the country's
largest power generator with 2,000 MW of capacity. Its preparation for
sale will take longer, said Grisanti.

One generation operation definitely not set for privatisation is the
massive Guri hydroelectric complex which is responsible for 10,000 MW
of electricity, more than half of all the country's capacity. The
government has said it will never privatise the hydropower complex;
most analysts concur that it would probably be impossible to do so.

According to Grisanti, the flotations are part of a large privatisation
programme involving tax reforms, establishment of a market-related
foreign exchange rate for the bolivar, a lifting or exchange controls,
price hikes for gasoline/petrol, the opening of the oil sector to
foreign investment (already under way), and an agreement with the World
Bank to supervise the privatisation of the power sector (PLA 5/19, Nov
1995).

In preparation for the flotation, the FIV has outlined a framework, or
action plan, which calls for the establishment of a rational tariff
schedule for 1996/97; a rationalisation of energy prices, such as oil,
gas and hydropower, improvement of utility management, and a market-
oriented regulatory framework for the sector. This last framework was
presented to the Electric Energy Regulatory Commission (CREE) last
autumn and to the utilities in December. The government says the
finalised framework should be ready by next month.

The regulatory framework calls for the following:

* Legal separation of generation, transmission and distribution.

* A single company to operate the national grid; free access to
transmission grid; and establishment of a single power pool.

* Freedom of entry to build generation capacity.

* Distribution companies and large industrial/commercial clients free
to sign direct P & S contracts.

* A new pricing mechanism for the wholesale market; and establishment
of short and long-term wholesale markets.

The action plan also calls for large end users to be able to buy freely
from generators and for distributors to buy wholesale at negotiated
tariffs.

Enelven generates, transmits and distributes thermal power. It has a
labour force of 1,702 and its 1,336 MW of capacity generates 3.6 TWh.
Enelco has a payroll of 480, installed capacity of 40 MW and an output
of 172.953 GWh.

Enelbar's labour force is 896, and its prime operation is to serve Lara
state. Its 150 MW of installed capacity, of which 120 MW is in use,
provides a gross generation of 1.6 TWh.

According to Grisanti, the plan is for a minimum sale of 79.9% of
shares in each of Enelven-Enelco  to a single investor group,
supplemented by an employee stock plan of up to 20%.

A minimum of 79.9% of Enelbar's shares also will be put on the market,
but these will be through an international tender, supplemented by an
employee stock ownership plan of up to 20%.

CHILE'S COLBUN:  PREPARING FOR PRIVATE LIFE

Colbun-Machicura, Chile's state-controlled hydroelectric generator, is
looking for a partner, or even partners, to provide finance and
expertise for a $400m development plan which will double its output in
the next three years.

If the search for a compatible associate is successful, Colbun will
eventually be a sizeable player in the industry, which is currently
dominated by two aggressive private sector companies, Endesa and
Chilgener.

Colbun is not selling off assets, as Jose Luis Mardones, its general
manager, explained in an interview with Power in Latin America.
Instead, the government is using the state company as a way to bring
new competitors into the field, specifically into the central
electricity grid (SIC).

Its model is the northern electricity network (SING), where there are
three private generators - Edelnor (controlled by Southern Company of
the US), Norgener (Chilgener) and Endesa. A controlling share in the
fourth, Tocopilla, owned by Codelco, the state copper corporation, was
awarded this month to a consortium of Powerfin, Iberdrola and Enagas
(see News). In this network prices have fallen steadily over recent
years.

The Colbun management began to develop its plan in the early days of
the Frei government in 1994, and gained approval for it the same year.
It is targeting three main areas, hydro power, gas generation and
transmission.

Hydro

In the hydroelectric sector, Colbun plans to increase capacity from 500
MW to around 730 MW by mid-1998. A first modest increase comes into
commission in May this year, with its 35 MW San Ignacio plant, down
river from the Colbun and Machicura plants. This, its third generating
centre, has cost $30m and was financed mainly with an equity issue
subscribed by existing private shareholders, bringing their share of
the company up from 7% to 15%.

Its fourth centre is the new 108 MW Rucue project, on a new river,
Laja, where it bought water rights from rival Endesa in 1994. Mardones
says preliminary studies are almost finished and a tender is expected
to go out before the end of January. The plant is scheduled to come
into operation in mid-1998 and represents an estimated investment of
$140m.

Gas plants

Colbun plans a move into gas-fired generation by 1998, with a plant at
Limache, in the Fifth Region, one of the most densely populated area
after Santiago. This is a turnkey project (PLA 4/24, Oct 1995), for
which General Electric, Mitsubishi and Siemens are reported to have
been short-listed. The plant will have a capacity of 340 MW-390 MW,
depending on the bid chosen. Colbun had originally budgeted $250m for
this project but now expects to be able to cut the cost by as much as
half.

Mardones said an important reason for locating the plant outside the
Santiago region was that it would not add to pollution in the capital,
which should be declared an ozone-saturated area in March this year. In
addition, being close to sea level gives greater efficiency, compared
to a Santiago site at 1,500ft. Also, the distance is not so significant
as to make transmission costs a major factor in supplying power to the
metropolitan region.

One other factor was also important. According to  Mardones the
government specifically wanted to see natural gas from Argentina taken
to the Fifth Region. Without Colbun's Limache plant, existing and
projected industrial and domestic consumption would not have justified
the $50m extension of the GasAndes pipeline from its route to Santiago.
The Fifth Region is industrially depressed, and the government hopes
the availability of natural gas will give it a comparative advantage
which will enable it to attract new industrial development. (Promoting
government decentralisation policy is not new to Colbun - it opened
offices in the southern provincial town of Talca on government
instructions.)

Transmission

The third plank of Colbun's strategy is a move into transmission, in a
direct challenge to Endesa, whose Transelec subsidiary has a monopoly
to carry power from the hydroelectric generating centres of the south
to the Santiago area.

The decision to build its own transmission line goes back to 1994 when
Transelec announced a hefty rise in its rates, and Colbun started
looking at the option of going independent. Its management decided that
the strategic advantage of having its own lines, and being able to
transmit up to 600 MW at peak time would be a valuable asset, as well
as making it independent of its competitor.

Endesa not surprisingly, has challenged Colbun's project (PLA 6/16, Dec
1995)  and has first option on the most convenient transmission route.
But negotiations are continuing, Mardones says, and Colbun is willing
to share the route and connect with Transelec to avoid duplication. In
that case, Colbun would be willing to upgrade its line to 500 kV and
bring forward its construction schedule to April 1997 to accommodate
Endesa's 447 MW Pangue plant, due on-line then.

But Mardones said a sine qua non was a satisfactory commercial
agreement giving his company freedom to use or sell the excess capacity
which will become available once a transformation bottleneck is
removed. This condition would only be fulfilled, according to Mardones,
if Transelec were to be made independent of Endesa.

In the meantime, Colbun intends to proceed with its plans. On January
3, it announced that it had awarded a contract to Asea Brown Boveri to
build the double-circuit 220 kV line, and given instructions to begin
work immediately. The value of the contract was not revealed, but
Mardones had previously estimated the cost as in the region of $50m.

Advice

Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank, has been advising Colbun on
financing for its development plan, and the government is considering
its report. Kleinworts - which also advised on the Tocopilla sale -
recommended that Colbun's best option was to take one or more strategic
partners. In the case of multiple partners, Colbun would be divided
into three companies, covering hydroelectric and gas-fired generation
and transmission.

Among those mentioned as potential partners for Colbun are Southern
Company (operating in Chile as Southern Electric), CMS Energy, Entergy
and Luksic, a Chilean financial-industrial conglomerate (See News).

The latter recently sold a 6% stake in Enersis (PLA 6/16, Dec 1995),
the holding company which controls Endesa and the Chilectra
distribution company, in a move which was widely interpreted as a
declaration of interest in Colbun, though it is also said to have
wanted the cash. It is expected that, as in the case of the Tocopilla
sell-off, current players in the SIC will not be allowed to bid.

Mardones indicates considerable interest in a Colbun partnership,
claiming the company has already received many enquiries from potential
partners. The timing is still not clear, however, and Colbun has
government authorisation to borrow to bridge any financing gap that may
occur.

Colbun is looking for a partner which will not only bring finance,
Mardones insists, but which shares a philosophy and a set of strategic
goals for the future of electricity generation in Chile. Colbun wants
to promote competition in the sector, reduce prices, to protect the
environment and its workers.

In the meantime, Colbun has instituted a restructuring designed to
increase the company's asset values and make it attractive to
outsiders. Management changes have been implemented, and programmes to
cut costs, increase efficiency and strengthen the company's sales
portfolio have been put in place.

Mardones was brought in at the beginning of 1995 from Enami, the state
copper refining and marketing company. In July a new finance and
administration manager with a private banking background was recruited,
and in September, a new development division was set up. This division
has responsibility for the expansion plan.

Since July, Knox D'Arcy, a UK management consultant, has been working
with Colbun on a cost-cutting programme. This, recently completed, is
expected to bring savings of $1m a year, Mardones says, mostly as a
result of cutting out overtime payments. One of the objects of the
exercise was to increase productivity without staff reductions.
Employees have been redeployed to new projects.

A major change has already taken place in sales policy. Until 1990,
Colbun was allowed to sell energy only to the SIC, essentially
supplying other generators. Changes in the law, introduced in 1990,
opened the way for the state company to sell direct to its customers
and it has since built up a portfolio of clients which it considers one
of its major assets.

As of end-1994 it was supplying six distribution companies, including
Chilectra and Chilquinta, and a selection of industrial users,
including El Teniente, Codelco's major underground mine.

Colbun's direct sales activity was boosted further last year with a 29
MW a year contract to supply the Ventanas copper refinery, belonging to
Enami. And it is targeting further growth in direct supplies to
distributors and industrials, irrespective of - but useful to absorb -
its projected capacity increases. Mardones says that there will be news
on this front in the near future.

In 1994, Colbun made an after-tax profit of $55m, with operating
profits of $53m on sales of $124m. Profits in 1995 will show a drop to
around $40m. Although operating profits increased slightly, non-
operating profits were down as a result of lower monetary correction.

Beyond 1998, Colbun expects to continue investing around $100m per
year, developing a series of small hydroelectric plants, using water
rights which it bought in 1994 at the same time as those for the Rucue
plant. It will also eventually be considering a second gas-fired plant.

COMMERCIALISING POWER TARIFFS

One of the biggest obstacles to creating a truly commercial electricity
supply industry in Latin America is the continued subsidisation of
power tariffs and, in some cases, a political reluctance to wind down
such practices.

The phenomenon is not new, nor is it exclusive to Latin America, being
rampant in Asia and lurking, chameleon-like, within the power sectors
of Europe and North America.

As students of the power sector in the Third World know, no two
countries are exactly alike - populations, histories and political
systems are different. The same holds true of their electricity supply
industries (ESI), with some systems staggering under the weight of
subsidisation and others attacking the challenge of commercialisation
with vigour.

The theme forms an important part of a new study*, Electricity
Generation in Latin America, by David Kurtz, which examines, on a
country-by-country basis, the generation and supply systems of all
countries - save the Caribbean islands - south of the Rio Grande River.

Kurtz points out that electricity subsidisation grew out of the belief
that lower power prices could curb inflation and stimulate economic
growth, a belief, however honourable, which proved to be folly.

What happened instead in the 1972-88 period was that electricity prices
deteriorated in real terms by 22%, while operating costs rose by around
14%. Power was used inefficiently, bill collection deteriorated and the
financial burden on utilities and governments - most power sectors
being nationally owned - increased to the extent that funds to maintain
and upgrade power generating and delivery systems dried up.

By 1990, the Latin American Electricity Organisation (OLADE) was able
to report, unhappily, that only five of the trade association's 26-
members in Latin America and the Caribbean were charging prices at or
above the long-term marginal cost of power.

Even now in Brazil, which is preparing for a major restructuring of its
power sector, electricity prices are kept low for electoral purposes,
with low prices serving as a disincentive to private investors, which
are unable to gain the necessary returns. (It must be noted that the
noises coming out of Brazil for the past year indicate that the central
government is trying to devise formulas to `take this on' so as to
smooth the way for the partial unbundling of Eletrobras.)

According to Kurtz's study, Brazil's tariffs, through July 1994, are,
at best, very marginal, with domestic tariffs being set at 4.78o per
kilowatt hour; commercial at 5.65o and industrial at just 2.86o. (It is
to be noted that commercial rates in the Indian Subcontinent range
around 7o-plus per kilowatt hour on average. Anything much below 6.5o,
the formula used in Pakistan, is a tight squeeze for independent power
project sponsors.) The study indicates that the worst-case scenario is
seen in Venezuela, where domestic power tariffs average just 0.79o/kWh,
commercial 2.31o and industrial 1.61o/kWh.

There is an upside to this as well, notably in Chile, Argentina and
Peru which have embarked on major privatisation programmes which, in
the case of Chile and Argentina, are all but complete. Their collective
tariff levels are, if anything, slightly higher than those of the US,
where domestic tariffs averaged 8.82o/kWh through mid-1994, commercial
8.08o and industrial 5.02o.

The study takes note of some of the individual tariff variations. In
Argentina and Colombia (See Table) domestic rates are much lower than
commercial rates and lower also than industrial rates. "This pricing
method, which is aimed at gaining favour from the voting public,
disadvantages industry", says Kurtz. "However, with the exception of
Argentina, where many industries are in the public sector, what the
government loses in higher industrial electricity costs it gains from
higher electricity revenues.

"By charging the commercial and industrial sectors higher prices, the
government is, therefore, better able to subsidise the residential
sector's prices, in return for electoral gains."

New players

The report is encouraged, nevertheless, by the momentum behind
electricity reform - there is scarcely a country mentioned in the
report that has not undertaken reforms or that is at least actively
planning them. This will mean an enhanced role for foreign concerns
either through sponsorship of new projects within the region or through
 acquisition of existing assets.

The report breaks down the likely big players - many of them already
stakeholders in various countries even now - into three categories.
Among regional companies are such active Chilean majors as Chilgener
and Endesa; from North America, there are Enron, Duke Power, Dominion
Energy, CMS Generation and Liberty Power/Cogentrix (See Bolivia News).

From abroad, meanwhile, the report notes the activities of Broken Hill
Proprietary of Australia, Spain's Endesa and Iberdrola, and the French
state utility Electricite de France. Not mentioned but certainly very
much a player is British Gas which, since the date of the report's
publication, has decided to shift its all-Americas operational
headquarters out of Texas to Argentina.

In spite of the economic difficulties that have beset Latin America -
some of them almost unique by  global standards, such as hyperinflation
- the region's share of electricity supply is, on a per capita basis,
better than that of Asia, the world's fastest-growing economic region.
The Indian subcontinent, with more than 1bn people, has 3% of total
global installed capacity of 2,911 GW, whereas Latin America, with less
than half that population level, has 6%.

China, bigger again, has 7%, with the rest of Asia and Australasia
taking a 13% share. Europe's share is 35% and North America's 28%
(albeit North America's installed capacity per head is nearly twice
that of Europe). Bringing up the rear are Russia/Middle East at 5% and
Africa at 3%.

What will Latin America's share be by 2003? Kurtz claims, using figures
from General Electric of the US, that total new generating capacity
worldwide by then will be 1,089 GW.  Latin America's share will have
climbed to 8%, while other Third World growth areas, such as
Asia/Australia, the Indian subcontinent and China will have increased
their shares to 22%, 6% and 16% respectively.

It is acknowledged that the European and North American electricity
supply industries are "mature", to say the least. Therefore their
global share of new capacity will have diminished to 18% and 17%
respectively. (It is for that reason that European and American
companies are taking such a high profile role in investing in the
electricity industries of developing countries.)

Another area of significant development is the progress made in recent
decades on the rate of electrification. According to OLADE, this
increased from 40% in 1970 to 70% in 1989. The report does caution,
however, that some of this growth increase stems more from urbanisation
of national populations rather than rural electrification. The report
does not ignore the `convenience' factor in spurring growth - the
growth in the sale of refrigerators, of cookers/stoves and even of
microwave ovens.

The most electrified countries so far are Uruguay, Argentina and Chile,
all at around 92% as a percentage share of population with electricity.
Those with the lost level of achievement are Paraguay, at 60%, Bolivia
at about 53 % and Peru at 48%.

CHILE CONTINUES ARGENTINE WOOING

The love affair between Chilean energy groups and their Argentine
counterparts continued in January, when companies from Chile made
further incursions into the electricity market of their trans-Andean
neighbour. New deals followed the important acquisition last December
of 39% of Buenos Aires utility Edesur by Chile's Enersis for $390m.

Chilean companies, looking for opportunities beyond their own
relatively small - though fast growing - domestic market of 14m people,
have increasingly turned their attention to neighbouring Argentina with
its far larger market of 33m consumers. In the past four years, they
have spent well in excess of $3bn on acquiring large chunks of
Argentine distributors and generators, mainly through the privatisation
process that broke up the old state-owned SEGBA. Along with a few other
countries such as the US and Spain, Chile is now one of the most
important players in the Argentine energy market.

For years Chile and Argentina, very different countries despite their
3,000-mile long shared border, were arch rivals. They nearly went to
war in the early 1980s, when both countries were ruled by military
dictatorships, over a dispute about the Beagle channel. In those dark
days, when Argentina was still pursuing a protectionist development
model, the idea of big cross-border investments was unthinkable.

But stability, democracy and rapprochement between former president
Patricio Aylwin of Chile and President Carlos Menem of Argentina paved
the way for much closer economic ties. Chile's participation in
Argentina's electricity privatisation process, an already functioning
oil pipeline and two planned gas pipelines between the two countries
are evidence that old suspicions are being consigned to history.

Indeed, Chilean groups, facing the possibility of a future energy glut
at home, show no sign of losing interest in Argentina, richer than
Chile, though less stable. With most opportunities in Argentina's
national network having been already bought up, Chilean companies are
now turning their attention to the country's provincial power sector.

Early in January, a consortium led by Emec, a subsidiary of Chile's
Sidgo Koppers group, beat off bids from three other hopefuls, paying
$63m in the privatisation of 90% of Empresa Electrica de San Juan. The
regional utility, which supplies an estimated 130,000 consumers in the
western Andean province, turns over around $60m a year. Emec will hope
to raise revenue well above this level by emulating other Chilean
companies which have a strong track-record of clamping down on the
illegal electricity connections, until recently endemic in Argentina.

The Agua Negra consortium, in which Emec has a 66% stake with the
remaining 34% held by Chilgener unit Hidroandes, may have been prompted
to invest in San Juan by the province's significant potential as a
mining region. Argentina's nascent mining industry, concentrated in the
Andean provinces, will need a reliable energy supply should the big
projects that are being predicted come on-line.

Chilean companies are likely to see further opportunities to purchase
provincial energy companies in Argentina. The federal government in
Buenos Aires is making financial aid to its 23, mostly cash-strapped,
provinces subject to a provincial government's willingness to transfer
state assets to the private sector.

Top on the list with banks are provincial generators and distributors,
many of which lose money and tend to be grossly overstaffed. The
Chileans, with hard-won experience of downsizing Argentine energy
companies, may feel they are up to the job of turning round these loss-
making provincial entities.

Among local governments that have already announced plans to privatise
their energy companies are Mendoza, the prosperous Andean province,
Santa Fe, one of Argentina's main industrial centres, Jujuy in the
north-west and Rio Negro in Patagonia. Chilean groups may to be
interested in all these sell-offs.

On the national scene, the Argentine investment arm of Chile's Endesa
has been active, buying an additional 17% stake in Buenos Aires-based
generator Central Constanera, which, following several expansions, now
has a nominal installed capacity of 1,260 MW, the largest in Argentina.
The purchase brings to 45% Endesa's stake in Central Constanera. Only a
few days before, Endesa had bought a 9% stake in generator Central
Termoelectrica Buenos Aires, itself 51%-owned by Central Costanera.

These purchases follow a flurry of activity towards the end of 1995,
which represented something of a second-wave in the assault on
Argentina by Chile's cash-rich utilities (PLA 6/12, Dec 1995).

This saw Enersis paying $390m for 39% of Edesur and then swapping
shares with fellow-Chilean Endesa to raise its Edesur stake still
further. Enersis is now to concentrate on generation, while Endesa will
stick more to distribution. Chilectra, in which Enersis is the biggest
shareholder, and Chilgener, a Chilean generator, also have important
slices of Argentine utilities. Chilean groups also have stakes in
Argentina's provincial hydroelectric plants, such as El Chocon.

According to Charles Barnett, energy analyst at Smith Barney, Chilean
involvement is a positive development for the Argentine energy sector.
Chilean electric utilities are " undoubtedly the most efficient and
best-managed in the region", he says. Most have now overcome the
initial resentment of Argentine consumers, many of whom baulked at
paying their electricity bills to a company from Chile.

Barnett says the fact that, for example, the future of Central
Costanera is in the hands of "top-notch" management from Endesa should
help to ensure this Argentine generator a bright future. The company's
shares are valued at half those of a typical Chilean energy utility,
but over time, says Barnett, their value is likely to catch up with
those of its Chilean rivals.

Chilean groups have had such success in Argentina that some are now
seeking to repeat the performance in Peru. When Brazil liberalises its
energy sector, there is little doubt that Chilean companies will be
there too.

HAITI REFORMS AWAIT NEW LEADER

An improvement in Haiti's deteriorating power supply will have to await
the installation in February of Rene Preval, who will succeed President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Preval will then indicate whether he will start
the implementation of politically unpopular reforms, including the
divestment of several state enterprises, including the power company.

The state of the company's generation and transmission facilities,
however, will deter "even the most optimistic of potential buyers"
according to a confidential report prepared by a US consulting firm.
"The amount of money which will be needed to make the company viable
will be an obstacle, if not to privatisation, at least to the plans for
a significant expansion in generating capacity", the report said.

The modernisation of the power company will cost about $970m, said Erns
Exceus, head of the government's privatisation programme. The company,
which uses oil-fired generators, has nominal capacity of 217 MW, but is
generating 101 MW, he said.

According to the country's economic development plan, Haiti will need
1,250 MW by 2004, reported Exceus. Current demand is 390 MW, said
government officials, and the shortfall from the power company is being
met by small private generators.

"These are expensive problems, but they also represent opportunities
for investors", Exceus said. The government hopes to set up rural
electrification projects using hydro-electric power, he added. The cost
estimates are "frightening", said Richard Archi, an economist with the
Inter-American Development Bank, which is Haiti's biggest international
creditor.

In addition to financing the expansion of company to meet the planned
demand, the investors will have to deal with the politically sensitive
issue of a significant increase in tariffs.

Haiti, with a population of 7m, is the poorest country in the Americas,
and the report suggests that there is an inadequate client base to
financially support the magnitude of expansion which the government
hopes will happen.

Commercial consumption has also been reduced in recent years as
companies closed after an embargo was put on the country to force out
of office the military which had overthrown and exiled Aristide for
three years. "The prospects for a rapid and significant improvement in
Haiti's power supply are not bright", the report said.

$4BN BID FOR YACYRETA?

A consortium formed by Ontario Hydro of Canada and the US company AES
Americas is reported to have offered $4bn to take over Yacyreta, the
monstrously expensive 3,000 MW hydroelectric plant that the Argentine
economy ministry is keen to shuffle off to the private sector.

Argentine newspapers reported that the consortium had offered $4bn,
more than double the $1.8bn set as a target by the government, after
discussions with Argentina's Energy Secretary, Carlos Bastos. Bastos
denied any such offer had been made, although he admitted talks had
taken place.

A western diplomat close to the negotiations confirmed that
representatives of the consortium had been in Buenos Aires on several
occasions with a view to putting together an offer. He did not know if
a concrete bid had been made.

"Everything is still very much in the air", the diplomat said. The
Argentine government, which owns the still uncompleted dam jointly with
Paraguay, had not obtained the go-ahead to privatise Yacyreta either
from the Paraguayan government or from its own Congress, he said.

"It's not clear whether the Argentine Congress will be amenable to the
deal." Neither had the basis for the sale been properly laid out, which
could explain the huge discrepancy between the supposed offer and the
government's figure. "It`s like trying to shoot at a moving target. The
government is still trying to put a package together and explain
exactly what is on offer."

The proposal from the consortium is said to involve payment of a fixed
sum in return for ownership of, rather than an operating concession for
the dam. The government's idea had been to offer a 20-30 year
concession on Yacyreta. The consortium would then assume all the risks
involved in completing the project, a process that would involve adding
15 turbines to the bring the dam to its full complement of 20, as well
as raising the level of the dam from 76 to 83 metres.

The latter process could involve the potentially controversial and
costly displacement of thousands of people. Indeed, it has taken so
long to complete the project that several hundred poor Paraguayan
families are said to have moved close to the dam so that they can sue
for compensation should they need to be relocated.

Bastos, reacting to the reports, said that if the $4bn referred to was
supposed to represent the whole value of Yacyreta, it vastly
underestimated the dam's worth. Yacyreta, dubbed by President Carlos
Menem of Argentina "a monument to corruption", cost an estimated $8bn
to build.

* Central Costanera has reported a rise in revenues and profits for
1995. Net profits reached $40.9m in 1995 compared to $36.7m in 1994, on
revenues up to $302.2m from $271.9m in 1994.

PEREZ BUILDS BA THERMAL PLANT

Perez Companc, the huge energy-based conglomerate, is to spend $230m on
building a 660 MW gas-fired power station in Ezeiza, a Buenos Aires
suburb. The power station, to be called Genelba, will be the second
biggest in the country after Central Costanera. Perez, which has
important stakes in electricity generation, transmission and
distribution, will feed energy from the plant into its own network.

Perez controls 16.6% of Edesur, through its 32.5% stake in the
Distrilec holding company, 5.99% of Central Costanera, the Buenos Aires
generator, and 9.75% of Transener, which owns and operates the 500 kV
and part of the 220 kV Argentine interconnected system.

Work started in mid-January and the plant is expected to be in
production by 1997. Given current market prices, Genelba should produce
energy worth an annual $130m.

Meanwhile, a second new Buenos Aires plant is also on the cards.
Generator Central Puerto has announced that it is planning to install a
360 MW combined cycle plant in the Argentine capital. The plant,
estimated to cost $140m, should be completed by 1998 and is expected to
produce energy at a 30% discount on conventional thermal power.

Central Puerto is keen to reduce production costs given the sharp rise
in power supply and falling prices. According to ING Barings, the
company is already the most leveraged electric utility in Latin
America, with a net debt/equity ratio of 88.7%

Separately, Central Puerto has merged formally with its 60%-owned
subsidiary Central Neuquen, which supplies electricity to parts of
Patagonia in southern Argentina. The purpose of the merger is to allow
Central Puerto to take advantage of tax credits held by Central Neuquen
worth about $25m.

A LITTLE LIGHT TROUBLE

The privatisation of Light, already delayed from December to March 13
(PLA 6/1, Dec 1995), has run into more trouble.

A few days before the scheduled December 28 publication of Light's
privatisation prospectus, the electricity workers' union, which holds
shares in the company, lodged a legal objection to the proposal to
split the company into two - the viable Light Rio, and Light
Participacoes, which would retain the company's 47% stake in the
country's largest distributor Eletropaulo and the R$1bn or so of the
latter's debts to Light.

Light has around half the capital of Eletropaulo whose total value is
put at R$3.5bn (US$3.6bn)  - interestingly close to the new, higher
estimates of Light's value, R$3.7bn, despite its R$1bn of Eletropaulo
debt. According to the Brazilian press, Eletropaulo - whose cost-
cutting includes laying off 5,000 staff in 1995 - is expected to be
operating efficiently in three year's time when Light's stake is
expected to be worth around R$4.5bn.

Although the objection was subsequently overturned in the courts, it
led to the postponement of a shareholders' meeting to OK the split,
which in turn is considered likely to delay the auction date by a
further two weeks to the end of March.

Brazilian observers of the process say, however, that even the end
March deadline is too optimistic and is likely to be met only if Light
desists from the split, which is now due to be approved by shareholders
at the end of January and sells the company along with its debts.
Otherwise, they say, the auction is likely to take place at the
earliest in May.

This will include an element of shares for sale to consumers via a fund
set up in the middle of January by Banco do Brasil. The minimum
investment in the new fund, BB Investment Privatization Fund-Light, has
been set at R$200. Deposits will be held in a fixed interest account
until the Light auction date, when they will be used to purchase
shares. Banco do Brasil estimates that the fund would attract R$50m-
100m. It intends to establish similar funds for subsequent
privatisations.

Meanwhile, once Light is out of the way, Eletrobras intends to move on
to other sales. It is currently studying a strategy for further
privatisations that would begin with Furnas, the south eastern
generator, which has been asked to prepare alternative scenarios for
its future.

These include the sale of one hydroelectric dam; the sale of several
dams on the same river basin or the division of Furnas into several
parts. Furnas is to present its recommendations by the end of January.
Eletrobras controls three other regional generators - Eletrosul,
Eletronorte and CHESF - but Furnas is the most important in terms of
population, industry and consumption. The company currently generates
54 GW and plans to double its capacity in the next 12 to 15 years.

* Emmanuel Nobrega Sobral was appointed president of Eletropaulo at the
end of December. Sobral, formerly Eletropaulo's financial director,
replaces Paulo Feldmann.

ENERGETICA SALE SET FOR APRIL

The auction of Nacional Energetica has been set for April. Originally,
it was thought that the company - with assets of R$185m (US$190.2m) -
would be sold in January, following the November liquidation of its
parent, Banco Nacional, which went into liquidation and was absorbed in
December by Unibanco.

Nacional Energetica, left on the shelf by Unibanco, is currently under
Central Bank control. Its main asset in the energy sector is a 51.54%
stake in the 1,300 MW Serra da Mesa dam on the River Tocantins in Goias
state. The project, under construction in partnership with regional
generation company Furnas Centrais Eletricas, is scheduled for
completion by April 1998, and is expected to generate earnings of $100m-
$400m a year.

Work on the dam continues apace despite the uncertainty over Nacional
Energetica's ownership thanks to Brazil's National Development Bank,
BNDES, which is providing project finance to the tune of R$57m. This
amount is sufficient for construction work to continue until the end of
March. Camargo Correa is carrying out civil engineering on the dam
which is now 70% complete. Nacional Energetica had invested R$247m in
the dam up to the start of this year, and and BNDES - which has pledged
to provide the remaining finance for the project - R$153m.

Nacional Energetica's president, Victor Paranhos, said in late January
that he had already been approached by 28 parties interested in the
company, including nine power companies (seven from the US) the Iven
Consortium which controls Escelsa, and Camargo Correa, Brazil's largest
construction company.

CEEE, CERJ PRIVATISATION PROGRESS

The state energy company of Rio Grande do Sul state, Companhia Estadual
de Energia Eletrica - CEEE, was authorised to open its capital to the
private sector by the state legislature in late December following the
presentation of a bill to this effect in November (PLA 6/2, Dec 1995).

A maximum of 49% of the shares in CEEE - estimated to be worth between
R$2.8bn (US$2.9bn) and R$5bn - will be sold under the proposal. The
company, which has debts of $90m, 9,800 active staff and 2,600
pensioners, is currently 99.8%-owned by Rio Grande do Sul state.

The next step is the evaluation of the company's assets and the drawing
up of a model of energy production and distribution in the state. Three
consortiums and an individual company submitted bids for this task on
December 28: Fator, Nera, Mercados and Arthur Andersen; Andersen
Consulting, Kleinwort Benson, Termoconsult and MMSO; Projeta, Deloitte
and Engevix; and consultant Booz, Allen & Hamilton do Brasil
Consultores.

Prequalifying technical proposals drawn up by the competitors will be
submitted for judgement in mid-January, while their prices for CEEE
will be presented in early February. The winners of the process will be
announced at the beginning of April.

The state government wants the consultants to give a clear definition
of all the steps necessary to place CEEE shares with their true value
on the market. It expects to have this information plus  details of an
energy plan for the state ready by the end of June 1996.

According to state energy secretary, Assis Alberto de Souza, CEEE
should invest R$150m in 1996 with $100m being financed by an issue of
debentures. In 1995 CEEE invested just $37m.

Rio Grande do Sul is the only Brazilian state where coal-fired power
stations predominate using local low grade, high ash deposits. Foreign
companies have shown an interest in making the plants more
environmentally-friendly in recent years. Neighbouring Uruguay has
complained of acid-rain caused by the plants.

The state government will be pressing for coal-fired solutions given
the jobs they sustain in the local mining industry.

Other regional privatisations are also progressing. Rio de Janeiro
state's Companhia de Energia Eletrica de Rio de Janeiro (CERJ) is
currently speeding towards the private sector.

At the end of December the state established a commission to manage the
process of selling off 14 of the state's 26 companies, and has just
published a prospectus for consultants to evaluate CERJ's assets and
prepare it for privatisation. CERJ distributes 25% of the state's
power, serving 1.2m customers; employs 4,806 staff (down from 5,758 a
year earlier) and had debts of R$54m in 1994.

The deadline for bids for the contract to advise on the CERJ
privatisation model isMarch 11, with the state announcing the winner a
month later. The privatisation reports are scheduled to be presented by
the end of August, allowing for privatisation in September. The
National Development Bank (BNDES) has agreed to lend the state R$244m
on the back of anticipated privatisation receipts.

Meanwhile, Mato Grosso state has also recently joined the bandwagon,
with an announcement that the state government was launching a series
of administrative reforms that would make possible the privatisation of
Cemat, as well as the regional bank, Bemat.

These will include regulations for offering concessions for public
services to the private sector and the removal of state subsidies. A
bill authorising the privatisations is expected to be sent to the
legislature by June this year.

* Sao Paulo state's secretary for energy, David Zylbersztajn, has sent
a bill to the state legislative proposing the creation of a public
energy service commission which will have the mission of regulating and
controlling electric energy services in the state.

CPFL UPS SALES, CUTS COSTS

Sao Paulo state electricity company, CPFL (Companhia Paulista de Forca
e Luz), has registered increased power consumption of 6% in 1995, with
an increase of 90,000 in its customer baseto 2.2m, mainly located
outside of Sao Paulo city.

Whether this will be sufficient to help stave off the worst of its
immediate financial problems, however, remains to be seen. In the first
nine months of last year, the company produced a five-fold increase in
net losses, and analysts at Brazil's Garantia bank are forecasting full
year losses of R$84m (US$86.4m) compared to a profit of R$22m in 1994,
as a result of higher operating costs and lower tariffs in real terms
following the July 1994 price freeze.

According to company president, Cesare Manfredi, CPFL is tackling its
costs, and anticipates savings of R$27m in 1996. In 1995, it
restructured its administration and reduced staff from 7,700 to 6,900.

The company has also worked on a restructuring of its business
divisions. In line with the unbundling proposals of state energy
secretary David Zylberstajn, it has now separated the accounting of its
generation, transmission and distribution sectors. CPFL has also
divided its operations into three business units: South East, North
East and North West.

CPFL plans to continue to invest next year, despite the cutbacks,
planning expenditure of R$90m, with R$30m of this used to maintain and
expand its system. During 1996 CPFL intends to build new sub-stations
at Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Lencois Paulista, Campinas, Sumari, Itapira
and Americana.

Amongst Brazil's electricity supply concessionaries, CPFL boasts the
shortest and the least frequent electricity supply interruptions.
CPFL's maximum period of interruption was 8.7 hours while the Brazilian
average was 16.5 hours. CPFL had an average interruption frequency of
6.7 per client compared to 21.5 nationwide.

There are three electricity concessionaries operating in Sao Paulo
state, CESP (Companhia Estadual de Sao Paulo); CPFL and Eletropaulo.
Sao Paulo, covering an area the size of the UK, is Brazil's most
populous state with over 33m inhabitants and is responsible for around
45% of the country's GDP.

ENERGY DEMAND RISES 7.6%

Brazil used 7.6% more energy in the eleven months to November 1995 than
in the same period in 1994, according to the latest statistics released
by Eletrobras. The figures for the full year should show a rise of 7.8%
says Eletrobras, well above the annual average of 3.3% registered in
1990-1994.

Electricity consumption clearly outstripped Brazil's GDP growth of
around 4% and points to energy shortages in the short-term if
investments are not stepped up in the sector.

A significant part of Brazil's increased energy consumption comes from
residential users. Since the introduction of the country's successful
anti-inflation plan in July 1994 there has been a marked increase in
the purchasing power of low income families who have acquired more
electric domestic appliances.

In 1994 these sales rocketed by 35% over 1993. In 1995 these rose a
further 15% with 40m units sold. As a result of using these appliances,
a large number of electricity consumers have moved into the category of
users of over 200 kW/month.

HYDRO OUTPUT BREAKS RECORDS

The world's largest dam, Itaipu, jointly-owned by Brazil and Paraguay
broke its own record in 1995 by producing 77.21 TWh. This was 11.2% up
on the level achieved in 1994. The increase was due to reduced
generator stoppages through improved maintenance programmes. The 18
turbines operated at 93% capacity during 1995. The 77.21 TWh
represented 31% of all Brazil's energy production in 1995.

Despite the progress, Itaipu is still owed large sums - R$1.4bn
(US$1.44bn) - by Brazilian energy distributors. The state government of
Sao Paulo (CESP, CPFL and Eletropaulo) is the largest debtor, owing
$1.2bn for energy used. The remaining $200m is owed by Eletrosul,
Furnas and ANDE.

Meanwhile, output is also breaking records at Companhia Estadual de Sao
Paulo (CESP), which beat its 1993 annual generation high at 10 a.m. on
December 22 last year, with output of 52 TWh. CESP is Brazil's largest
generating company, responsible for 22% of the country's energy
production. It is able to cover the equivalent of all consumption by
Brazil's 38m households. The company expects its revenue from
distribution to increase by R$9m in 1995.

NEW CHAIRMAN FOR BOLPOW

Bolivian Power Co, the only private sector power generator in Bolivia,
has announced the appointment of E. Glen Biggs to succeed Frank Benner
as board chairman. Benner will remain a director of the company, which
has the rare distinction for a Latin America power generator of being
quoted on the New York stock exchange.

The company also announced that Bruce McMillen, senior group vice-
president and chief financial officer of Cogentrix Energy of the US,
had resigned from Bolivian Power's board. He is succeeded by David
Lewis, presently chief executive at Cogentrix Energy.

Bolivian Power, founded in 1925, distributes and transmits power in La
Paz and Oruro. It has a 34% share of all generation in the country,
operates 13 hydo facilities with a total capacity of 134 MW and is
expanding by 62 MW its hydro capacity in the so-called Zongo Valley
project.

Part of this capacity will be on-line this year and all will be
delivering power by 1998. It is also installing a gas-fired plant of 17
MW at El Alto near La Paz, which went on-line last summer. It is
considering a 230 MW hydropower operation in the Miguillas Valley. Its
growth rate this decade has been in excess of 6%.

Bolivian Power's shareholding includes a 17% stake held by Liberty
Power/Cogentrix Bolivia Inc. According to the New Electricity Law, it
will divest itself of power distribution responsibility, and will focus
on generation. Its net income last year was $7.7m on a turnover of
$45.9m.

TOCOPILLA FLOATED

Codelco, the state copper corporation, has chosen a consortium of
Belgium's Powerfin, Spain's Iberdrola and the domestic Enagas as its
strategic partner for the Tocopilla power plant.

The decision was made eventually a month later than the scheduled late
December date as a result of a lengthier and more complex due diligence
process than Codelco had anticipated

The agreement calls for the formation of a new equity partnership in
Tocapilla Holding Ltda., which controls the 615 MW, coal-fired
Tocopilla power plant near Antofagasta in northern Chile.

Powerfin has a 62.5% stake in the bidding consortium, with Iberdrola
holding 25% and Enagas having the balance. The consortium will pay
$177. 8m for a 51% stake in Tocopilla, with Codelco controlling the
remainder. Codelco is to set up a new company to own the 51% stake,
which will in turn be 51% owned by the bidders.

The remaining 49% of Tocopilla will also eventually be sold, 10% to the
plant's workers and the remainder through local exchanges or ADRs.

Powerfin's parent Belgian utility Tractebel said that some $70m needed
to purchase Tocopilla will be funded through project financing. The
balance of $110m will come from the three bidding companies.

Tocopilla consists of ten units, a port and 600 km of high-voltag e
transmission lines. It has a workforce of 400 and will be operated
jointly by Iberdrola and Powerfin under the latter's lead. The site's
electricity is sold mainly via long-term contracts to northern Chile's
copper mines, including that of Chuquicamata, the world's largest open-
pit copper mine, and will supply Codelco's El Abra joint venture with
Cyprus Amax Minerals (130,000m tpy), when it starts producing in late
1996.

Meanwhile, the plant has recently picked up yet another mine contract,
signing a 20-year deal to supply Codelco's Radomiro Tomic mine, which
will have output of 130m tpy from 1997. The Radomiro Tomic contract is
estimated to be worth $55m and is for 70 MW from 1998 to 2002, rising
afterwards to100 MW. It will use part of the same transmission system
as the El Abra mine. A contract for the latter has been awarded to the
Spanish-Chilean firm Abenor S.A.

CONSUMPTION SOARS 9.2%, ANOTHER 8.8% SEEN IN `96

Chile's electricity consumption soared by 9.2% last year compared to
1994, reports the National Energy Commission (CNE). The figures showed
demand for liquid fuels climbed 7.4%, while coal consumption was 14%
higher.

"The sector has been able to supply in an opportune way the growing
energy requirements which are the result of the country's strong
economic and social development", CNE president Alejandro Jadresic
said.

The forecast is for a further increase of 8.8% this year. The energy
sector is one of Chile's most active, with projects worth more than
$4bn under construction or in advanced planning. These include thermal
and hydropower stations, two natural gas pipelines and expansion
projects at oil refineries.

According to the CNE, the two trans-Andean pipeline schemes continue to
advance. CNE`s records show that the GasAndes scheme, led by Chilgener
and Canada's Nova Corp. had already presented its environmental impact
study for approval and has negotiated 85% of the rights of way needed
for the pipeline scheme. TransGas, headed by Tennedo of the US and
British Gas had not yet presented its environmental impact study. It
had agreed 65% of its rights of way, said Jadresic.

Both plan to supply Chile with natural gas from central Argentina but
by different routes, Gasandes linking the Neuquen gasfields in northern
Argentina to Santiago, the Chilean capital, and TransGas traversing the
Andes by a more southerly route.

GasAndes says it will start laying pipe on the Argentine side of the
border in January. In Chile, they are waiting for approval of their
environmental impact study but say they are still on schedule. They are
meeting steady opposition from neighbourhood groups on the route down
to Santiago through a local beauty spot, the Cajon del Maipo.

LUKSIC, US GROUPS TIE UP ATACAMA PIPE SCHEME

CMS Energy and the Williams International Pipeline Co. of the US plan
to go ahead with the Atacama gas pipeline project and have signed
letters of intent with the local Luksic group. Luksic would take a 15%-
20% stake in the $350m project while CMS and Williams keep 40%. The
project is still looking for an Argentine partner.

The pipeline would bring gas from Jujuy in northern Argentina, near the
Argentinan-Bolivian border with northern Chile, to Tocopilla on Chile's
north coast, with branches further north to Iquique and south to
Antofagasta. The new timing is for an open season in the first half of
this year with work starting before the end of the year and the pipe
coming into operation in early 1998.

CMS and Williams say they need to sign contracts with power generators
for between 600 MW and 800 MW of capacity for the project to be viable.
The initial capacity of the pipeline would be 3.4 MMcm per day. Some
doubt has, however, been expressed as to the immediate viability of the
project.

The new Collahuasi copper mine has signed a contract with Endesa (PLA
3/13, Sept 1995) for power which will be generated by its new coal-
fired Patache plant. In the view of the government's National Energy
Commission (CNE), this alone is sufficient to postpone the supply of
gas to the area for the short and medium-term.

It is not clear that the generating companies of the northern
electricity network will want to convert from coal to gas. But a
spokesman for Williams says they are confident about getting the
contracts they need.

The project, if it goes ahead, could bring to three the number of gas
pipelines running from Argentina. The northern link would complement
the more complex Gas Sur and Gas Andes pipelines schemes being prepared
to deliver gas from Central Argentina to the Santiago/ Concepcion areas
on Chile's central west coast.

Endesa has been awarded a two-year provisional licence by the state
auditing board for the controversial 570 MW Ralco dam project on the

The authorisation was given in the face of strong opposition from
environmentalists and locals, who were concerned about the visual
impact on the site, a beauty spot, and the enforced relocation of the
Pehuenche Indians who live nearby.

The licence will allow the state generator to begin detailed studies
into construction prospects for the $600m dam and to examine its impact
on the environment. Endesa wants the hydro plant to be on-line by 2002.

CHILGENER PLANS $500M INVESTMENTS FOR `96

Chilgener's G-M Jose Antonio Guzman announced investments of $500m for
1996. These could rise to $650m depending on the success of the
company's bids in privatisation sales in other Latin American
countries.

Financing will come mostly from bond issues. For example Chilgener this
month issued a `yankee bond,' placing $150m on the US market in the
form of 10-year bonds. The bond issue was placed by Smith Barney, Chase
Securities and ING Barings. A separate private place of $180m will help
refinance its Gualcolda power plant.

The Empresa Electrica de Santiago, which is building the Nueva Renca
gas-fired power plant and in which Chilgener has a 51% stake, will not,
according to Guzman, need new financing. The plant will be built using
suppliers credits.

* Moody's Investors Service has assigned a Baa-1 rating to the $150m
bond. The rating reflects Chilgener's solid financial position and
sound business strategy, says Moody's, emphasising that the company is
also operating in a stable regulatory and economic regime.

About two thirds of the company's resource portfolio is thermal, with
the balance mainly run-of-river hydropower units. Concerns about
Chilgener's higher production costs relative to hydro-based competition
are largely offset by growing electrical demand in Chile and Argentina
and by the company's ability to maintain reliable production regardless
of rainfall conditions, says Moody's.

ENERSIS BOOSTS CAPITAL THROUGH MAJOR SHARE OFFER

The holding company, Enersis, which controls Endesa, the power
generator, and Chilectra, the Santiago distributor, has made a $240m
share offering. The 30-day preferential share option lasted to mid-
January.

Demand in the Chilean market, however, has been high and the options
which the private pension funds have been unable to take up because of
legal limits on exposure have been bought up by other shareholders or
future investors.

The capital increase will go towards financing the company's two major
investment projects - its successful bid for 39% of Edesur, the
distribution company which serves the south and centre of Buenos Aires,
and a planned bid for Rio Light of Brazil.

Together with its distribution subsidiary, Chilectra, Enersis paid
$390m for its new stake in Edesur. Short-term financing took the form
of a syndicated loan from five international banks but a bond issue is
expected to follow.

At the end of December, Enersis transferred a 5.6% stake in Edesur to
the local Chispas investment companies for an estimated $55m. The pre-
arranged move is to help diversify the holdings of the Chispas so that
they become eligible for private pension fund investment. Currently,
the Chispas' main asset are their shares in Enersis.

POWER CRISIS DEEPENS

After a year of chaos in electricity sector, with brown-outs of up to
eight hours a day in the second half of last year (PLA4/4, Oct 1995),
Ecuador is settling down to an equally difficult 1996.

The year began about as badly as was possible. In the second week of
January, electricity employees declared a two-day strike in protest at
the government's power sector privatisation bill, which was expected to
be passed by Congress that week.

The bill foresaw the unbundling of generation, distribution and
transmission and the extention of private sector access to the system.
It also proposed the consolidation of the existing 19 distributors in
the country into four or five companies, as well as the restructuring
and sale of 49% of state-run INECEL. Its proposals also included the
creation of a regulatory agency.

The strike, only affecting administrative functions, was threatening
also to hit the country's already disabled power station production as
PLA went to press, notably the Paute hydro plant, which was in the
hands of the strikers and which provides some 60% of the country's
power.

President Sixto Duran Ballen, meanwhile, has ordered the army to take
over the running of the plants should the bill be passed.

The bill, deadlocked in parliament for almost two years, had been
hailed as the solution to the country's deeper capacity problems, by
facilitating the construction of privately-owned plant. Ecuador
currently has 2,300 MW of installed capacity, but only 1,590 MW of
effective, guaranteed capacity, short of the current 1,760 MW of demand
and leaving no margin for the 6% growth forecast for last and this
year.

PERU OUTLINES EXPANSION PLANS

further 218 MW expansion of generating capacity in 1996. This should be
enough, he says, to preclude power supply problems - always provided
that rainfall is normal.

The bulk of the extra 218 MW will be made up as follows: 100 MW in the
first phase expansion of Edegel, the recently-privatised collection of
hydro and thermal plants serving Lima; 20 MW from the expansion of
thermal capacity at the Zorritos plant, 60 MW from Pucallpa and 13 MW
from Tarapoto.

Additionally, by early 1997, San Roman expects there will be a further
140 MW available from Ventanilla, Lima's thermal power station which
was acquired in December by Endesa of Spain (PLA 6/18).

In a recent interview, San Roman justified the government's decision to
continue with the exemption from the selective consumption tax (ISC)
for fuel used for thermal electric generation.

"There should be no exceptions to taxes applied", he said, "but in this
case it is necessary, otherwise electricity tariffs would have risen".
He accepted that Peru's increased reliance in the short-term on thermal
energy would mean steeper import bills for diesel.

Not all government officials are as sanguine as the vice-minister over
electricity sector prospects. Luis Haro, director-general for
electricity at the mines ministry, told a conference in early January
that current reserves stood at barely 5% of generating capacity when
they should ideally be at 20%.

MANTARO HYDRO HITS TROUBLE

The Mantaro hydro complex, backbone of electricity generation for
central and northern Peru and scheduled for privatisation in the near
future, is facing serious problems.

Experts predict that, given the precarious state of the concrete lining
of the main, 20km tunnel between the main intake and the machine house,
the jewel in Electroperu's hydro crown may fetch far less than
anticipated when it reaches the auction block later this year or next.

Mantaro comprises two separate hydros known as Santiago Antunez de
Mayolo and Restitucion. Together they account for a quarter of total
national electricity generation capacity.

Mantaro's generating potential is 1,015 MW, with normal output ranging
between 850 and 900 MW. Today it is generating a bare 715 MW due,
according to consultants, to build-up of solids in the tunnel and,
probably, the deterioration of the interior walls. The tunnel has never
been emptied for maintenance work in the 22 years since it opened.
Attempts last year by the Canadian company Aquatic Sciences to carry
out inspections with robots were unsuccessful.

OUTPUT UP 3.3% IN 10 MONTHS

Electricity output rise by 3.3% in the first ten months last year
compared to 1994, reports the Energy and Mines Ministry. Total output
stood at 12,236 GWh, said the report.

It said that electrical production, including output from Peru's
interconnected north-central, southwest, southeast and other isolated
systems reached 11,840 GWh in the January-October period. Power from
hydro plants accounted for 84.6% of total output while thermal power
generation made up 15.4%.

According to the statistics, public service firms produced 10,521 GWh
while companies generating their own captive power accounted for 861.3
GWh. Electroperu, the largest of the country's seven state-owned power
generators, produced 6,332 GWh, followed by recently privatised Edegel,
which had an output of 2,203 GWh, and Egasa 587.8 GWh. Peru's total
output in October rose 2% to 1,233 GWh compared to 1,209 GWh in the
same month in 1994.

* The Peru stock exchange has approved the listing of Edelnor. The
state sold 60% of Edelnor, which distributes power in northern Lima to
a consortium of Chilean, Peruvian and Spanish interests for $176m. The
consortium comprises Inversions Distrilima, led by Enersis, and
Distribuidora Chilectra Metropolitana of Chile and Spain's Endesa.

AGUAYTIA DEAL FORMALISED

A formal agreement has now been signed with a six-company consortium to
develop the Aguaytia gas and related power project.

The project involves the development of the Aguaytia gas field, which
has proven reserves of 223 Bcm; the construction and operation of
natural gas processing facilities,NGL storage facilities,  some 140
miles of gas pipeline and 65 miles of NGL pipeline. A 145 MW gas plant
and 265 miles of transmission lines to connect with the existing grid
system were to be added at a later date.

Only three of the initial four US companies which signed an MOU last
August (PLA 2/20) to develop the $200m complex - El Paso Natural Gas,
Panhandle Eastern Corp and Maple Resources Corp - are still on board.
Entergy, which was to have operated the power plant, has pulled out.
The three new participants are Pennsylvania Light & Power arm, Power
Markets Development Company; Illinois Power arm, Illinova Generating
Company; and Scudder Latin American Power.

Work on the project is scheduled to begin in the first quarter of this
year.

GUYANA POWER SECTOR REHAB PLANS HIT SNAGS

Guyana's urgent effort to rehabilitate its decrepit electricity system
and impose a measure of private commercial discipline (PLA 6/20, Dec
1995) is running into snags.

Trade union pressure last month forced the resignation of Raymond
Gaskin, chairman of the Guyana Electricity Corp. (GEC). He had been
appointed by President Cheddi Jagan himself. The main electricity
union, the National Association of Agricultural, Commercial and
Industrial Employees (NAACIE), had taken exception to the speed with
which Gaskin, with government backing, was trying to commercialise the
operation, including successive power supply rate hikes and the sacking
of up to 213 workers.

NAACIE even called a strike at GEC, illegal in an essential service, to
put pressure on Gaskin to withdraw retrenchment notices. He accused the
union of having a `political agenda' and blamed him for the fact that
`things are not going well at GEC.'

Gaskin said he felt he had no option but to resign after the union fed
`lies' about him to the People's Progressive Party (PPP), the senior
partner in the governing coalition, and to the government itself. The
former chairman can claim some credit for making efforts to improve the
troubled utility, whose performance record is probably the worst in the
Caribbean, with the exception of the Dominican Republic's state-owned
electricity company.

He was instrumental in obtaining additional units from various foreign
sources to reduce the gap between supply and demand, and the rate hikes
enabled GEC to do away with treasury subsidies. he also tried to root
out corruption at the corporation, and several former employees are
before the courts on charges of electricity theft and misuse of GEC
funds.

Gaskin's forced departure is only one of the setbacks facing GEC in its
desperate effort to move forward.

The $12m joint venture between the government-owned bauxite company,
Linden Mining Enterprise (Linmire) and the US Resources Recovery
International, has been put on hold following objections by the
government's privatisation unit. The government unit felt the project
should have been put to tender on a wider basis. The joint venture
company was to install 19 MW of new capacity, 5.5 MW of which would
have been sold to GEC.

The $309m investment by four US companies, trading under the name of
United Health Clinics (UHC), to create power from waste, has also been
stalled.

Senior government officials apparently do not believe the group can
deliver what it says. The proposal was to supply up to 60 MW to the
national grid by using heat generated from all types of local waste.
The government investment promotion agency, the Guyana Office for
Investment (GO-Invest) was in favour of the scheme and seemed satisfied
with the bona fides of the participants. But other officials have
stepped into the picture and demanded better feasibility studies of the
project.

GO-Invest's director, Dr. Ivor Mitchell, says he will pursue the matter
because he has seen waste-to-electricity plants operate successfully in
the US and says "I believe they can work in Guyana".

LOCAL TIE-UP STRENGTHENS BIDDERS CHANCES

The two front runners in the bid to purchase the state-owned Jamaica
Public Service Company, the island's electricity monopoly, have formed
consortia with local companies - a move which bankers say will
strengthen their chances of being selected.

Although the government has an official short list of five prospective
buyers, the two which are considered the leading contenders are Houston
Industries Energy Inc of Texas, and Southern Electric of Georgia. Less
fancied are Enterprise Diversified Holdings and Charter Oak Energy,
both of the US, and Ontario Hydro of Canada.

Southern Electric has created its consortium by drafting Life of
Jamaica and Mutual Life, two of Jamaica's largest life insurances
companies. Houston Industries Energy has been joined by Island Life and
Manufacturers Merchant Bank.

"These arrangements will enhance the chances of the companies in their
bid to purchase the Public Service Company, and the final decision by
the government's Divestment Committee could be influenced by what the
local firms can bring to the table", explained one of Jamaica's leading
bankers who is advising one of the consortia.

Life of Jamaica and Mutual Life are joining Southern Electric as
investors. Island Life will also be an investor with Houston Energy
Industries, while Manufacturers Merchant Bank will provide financial
services support. Southern Electric has also recruited influential
support in the form of Andrew Young, the former US ambassador to the
United Nations and mayor of Atlanta, who has been visiting Jamaica
frequently to lobby for the Atlanta company.

Robert Pickersgill, Jamaica's utilities minister, and several
executives of the Public Service Company, have visited the US
headquarters and major power installations of both Houston Industries
Energy and Southern Electric. Government officials say "nothing of
significance" should be read into the fact the installations of the
other three bidders were not visited.

Jamaican officials are also studying the operations of Trinidad &
Tobago's electricity company in which Southern Electric took a 49%
stake just over a year ago.

The government is hoping that the sale of the power company, which is
scheduled to be concluded by the middle of this year, will be followed
by increased stability in power supplies. The company currently has
capacity of 663 MW and average production is 505 MW to meet peak demand
of 405 MW.

With the commissioning of privately owned barge-mounted and land-based
plants, it will have output for the national grid of well over 700 MW
by August.

Jamaicans will feel the effect of the change in ownership almost as
soon as the sale is complete. The government will require the
successful bidder to modernise and improve the Public Service Company's
efficiency by spending about $800m over 15 years. This will not be
financed solely from the company's operations. It reported a net profit
of $5.8m in the 1994-95 fiscal year, $7.5m less than the previous year.

Company officials have complained, however, that the firm's finances
would have been better had the government granted a tariff increase.
The last increase was granted in 1991, and the government has been
reluctant to make adjustments, apparently because it would be
politically unpopular.

Lee W. Hogan, chief executive of Houston Industries Energy, has warned
that divestment of the Public Service Company will be followed by a
rate increase. If his company's bid were successful, Hogan said, it
would try to curb the hike in rates by selling more power.

"You make more money by selling more energy", he said. "The way to make
money in this business is to maximise growth, not price." An acceptable
rate of return for the company would be between 8.5% and 9% on total
assets, adjusted to debt and interest charges, he said.

The Public Service Company's financial position would have been
stronger in the 1994-95 year, were it not for an explosion at the Old
Harbour Station which destroyed over 100 MW of capacity, said Derrick
Dyer, the company's chief executive. "This is not a fire sale", he said
of the impending divestment. "The company is very much alive and
kicking and, in many respects, is a showpiece for other developing
countries. This is the opinion of international agencies."

MEXICO PUTS ITS CLOCKS FORWARD

Mateo Trevino, who is head of the Mexican government's energy saving
organisation, has one very basic problem.

His job is to convince consumers and producers that wasting electricity
makes no economic sense. But with electricity tariffs that themselves
make little economic sense his task is a difficult one. This year, he
and his organisation, the Support Trust for the Energy Saving Program
(FIDE), have to convince the country to put its clocks forward by an
hour for six months, a change the government thinks will bring about
annual savings of $1.5bn.

A presidential decree establishing Mexican `'summer time" appeared in
the Diario Oficial, Mexico's version of the Federal Register, on
January 4 of this year.

Environmental interest groups and government officials said that the
measure,which will affect Mexico's three time zones from April 7 to
October 27, should save up to 1% of the energy the country currently
uses, through rationalising the use of extended daylight hours. From
1996 on, clocks will be set forward one hour on the first Sunday of
each April and back on the last Sunday of each October.

According to Rogelio Gasca Neri, Director General of Mexico's Federal
Electricity Commission (CFE) the time change should result in fewer air
contaminants being released, as well as more efficient dispersion of
airborn pollutants.

The adoption of summer time is the first step of a six point energy
plan Trevino has the responsibility of promoting. In its entirety, the
plan aims to reduce Mexico's energy consumption by 7.3% by the year
2000 through rationalisation of energy use. By the government's own
reckoning, electricity wastage has already fallen by 5% in recent
years.

As a country with many remaining infrastructure problems and hundreds
of isolated communities, Mexico rations itself when it comes to
executing large scale changes in popular perceptions. A proposal to
introduce summer time in 1992 was brushed aside because at the time the
Mexican government was busy with a programme to re-denominate the
currency.

`'The need to introduce summer time has not been so pressing in Mexico
as it has been in countries further to the north, with greater seasonal
variations in their day", said Trevino. `'But we clearly need to create
a culture of energy conservation.''

Many of the campaigns promoted by Trevino and FIDE aim at the
electricity consumer rather than the producer, such as is the case with
two programmes that seek to introduce the use of more efficient light
bulbs and air conditioners. Revamping existing electricity generation
and transmission equipment to increase efficiency and reduce waste is,
after all, a very costly proposition.

NEW ENERGY MINISTER APPOINTED

A Mexican government reshuffle in the dog days of 1995 took most
commentators by surprise by its timing and heralded changes in the
energy sector.

President Ernesto Zedillo's late December restructuring of his cabinet
removed Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza, the former energy secretary, and
something of a member of the ruling party's old guard, replacing him
with Dr Jesus Reyes Heroles, an economist.

Pichardo's position had greatly weakened since he took office a little
more than a year before. Troubled by ill health, and - particularly
during the beginning of his time at the energy ministry - afflicted by
political controversy, Pichardo never seemed the natural choice to
preside over the privatisation and liberalisation of much of Mexico's
energy policy.

At the beginning of 1995, tensions appeared to arise between Pichardo's
energy ministry and the Finance ministry with regard to the future
course of energy privatisations and liberalisation. He will now move on
to a post within the Mexican foreign office, most likely as a diplomat
overseas.

Pichardo's successor, Jesus Reyes Heroles, son of a Mexican politician
from a generation before, won early recognition as head of a Mexican
economics thinktank, Grupo Economistas y Asociaciados.

In the job he held immediately prior to his new appointment, Reyes
Heroles served as head of Banobras, a Mexican state development bank,
where he tried to up investment by innovative schemes including the use
of seed money. Whether he will try similar mechanisms in a sector where
private spending has drawn close to a halt is yet to be determined.

CFE CONFIRMS EXPANSION PLANS

Mexico's Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) announced that over the
next two years it plans to increase its installed generation capacity
by 2,250 MW, to reach a national total of 35,702 MW to meet national
demand.

In a press release, the CFE emphasised the importance of plans to begin
operating units three through six of the geothermal Cerro Prieto
complex, in Baja California, as well as referring to the 350 MW unit 4
of the coal fired Carbon II programme, in the northern state of
Coahuila, and the thermal combined cycle units 5 and 6 of the Adolfo
Lopez Mateos project, which between them will provide 700 MW for the
town of Tuxpan.

The CFE said that hydroelectric dams will be put into commercial use in
the northwestern state of Sinaloa, where two 200 MW units should come
on-line, as well as between the southern states of Veracruz and Oaxaca,
where the Temascal dam will have two units of 100 MW each, and between
the central areas of Hidalgo and Queretaro, where the Fernando Hiriart
dam will have two units of 140 MW each.

The release said that at the beginning of the Zedillo administration in
December 1994, 1,675 MW of capacity was being tested to be put into
operation, while 2,251 MW was in the process of being contracted or
constructed, all of which should enter into operation before the end of
1997.

During 1995, 1,345 MW was put into operation, leaving 2,581 MW to be
switched on over the next two years.

* Luz y Fuerza del Centro, the main electricity distributor in the
Mexico City area with 24m clients, has contracted the services of
Spain's Union Fenosa Acex to begin a modernisation process. Acex is the
international consultancy arm of Union Fenosa, Spain's third largest
utility.

The contract, which will involve a major technical renovation at Luz y
Central, underlines Fenosa's presence in the region, where it already
has development and technical transfer projects with utilities in the
Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Colombia.

ARGENTINA CALLS FOR TENDERS FOR OIL EXPLORATION

Argentina is calling for tenders for oil exploration in seven areas
near disputed waters around the Falkland/Malvinas/Malouines islands.
Tenders will have to be lodged by January 31, says the Energy
Secretariat. Britain withdrew objections last year against oil tenders
in waters bordering its claims after an historic agreement with
Argentina. The agreement allows both countries to charge royalties for
any oil or gas extracted from Falkland waters - Argentina plans to levy
3% and Britain 9% without compromising their conflicting claims to
sovereignty. British Gas and YPF will jointly study hydrocarbon
potential off the islands.

As far as Falkland locals are concerned, there are still tensions, says
Richard Ralph, the new British governor. He said locals do not bear
Argentina any ill-will, despite the 1992 Argentine invasion (and
subsequent eviction with extreme prejudice), but do not wish to have
much, if anything, to do with Argentina so long as sovereignty is
disputed. Despite increased potential for co-operation, notably in
energy and fisheries, Argentines travelling on national passports are
not allowed on the Falklands, apart from relatives visiting the graves
of sons killed in the war.

CALOR GROUP EXPANDING IN LATIN AMERICA

The Calor Group of the UK is further expanding Latin American
operations with a $31m investment in Supergasbras Distribuidora de Gas,
the Brazilian liquified petroleum gas major. The UK group's investment
has been matched by SHV Energy, its joint venture partner in SHV Calor
Brazil, which was set up last year. Calor and SHV are spending $62m for
a 49% stake in Supergas and 50% of the voting rights. Supergas lost
$4.2m in 1994.

Calor was in the news last August with the acquisition of a majority
stake in Minasgas, a bottled gas supplier. It is understood Supergas
and Minasgas will be operated as separate companies. Calor said it
would encourage rival suppliers to draw up a co-operation arrangement
for the future. The two companies supply a combined total of 1.35mt of
LPG to a customer base of 40m people. Calor announced last year plans
to spend #70m ($110m) in projects in Latin America and Asia in
conjunction with SHV Energy, the privately-held Dutch group with
ultimately controls Calor. The strategy is to broaden Calor's base

PIPELINE MAY NOT GO AHEAD

Hondo Oil & Gas of the US is expressing fears that a natgas pipeline
planned by it and Amoco may not go ahead because of changes in pipeline
tariffs and natgas prices. The company said also that its Opon No. 5
development well has been delayed indefinitely because of right-of-way
disputes with landowners. Hondo said the Comision de Regulacion de
Energia y Gas had set a ceiling price for natgas and a maximum rate of
return of 12.5% (before local taxes) for pipeline tariffs. The ceiling
is interpreted to include costs or fees for the processing of natgas,
thus processing costs cannot be passed on to buyers.

As a consequence, these regulations "will reduce the amount the company
expects to receive for natgas and pipeline tariffs in the future", the
company said. The regulations affect the terms agreed to in a MOU with
Ecopetrol for the construction of a pipeline and the sale of natgas.
The agreement was signed on July 31. It calls for an 88 km pipeline
from the contract area to Ecopetrol's refinery at Barrancabermeja.
Negotiations are continuing with Ecopetrol to seek relief from the
regulations so the project can be got under way.

b/d, up from 40,000 b/d in 1994. Guerrilla activity remains a threat
and are estimated to have caused $45m in damage to pipeline and other
facilities since 1986.

ECOPETROL TO ATTEMPT TO SELL ITS STAKE IN PROMIGAS

Ecopetrol is to make a second attempt to sell its stake in natgas
distributor Promigas, with an offer of 38.87% of the company on January
24 at Ps2,800 per share. The shares include 24.99% owned directly by
Ecopetrol and 13.88% owned by Explotaciones Condor. Ecopetrol first
tried to sell the stake locally to employees, pension funds and co-
operatives at the end of 1995. In September 1994, it sold 3.29% of the
company, whose other shareholders include the IFC (11.79%) and
financier Corfivalle (9.82%). The sale is part of a wider divestment of
$235m of Ecopetrol's non-operational assets in 1996.

CUBA HOPES TO PRODUCE MORE CRUDE THIS YEAR

Cuba hopes to produce some 1.5mt, or about 11.3m bbl, of crude this
year, fractionally up from last year's figure of 1.45mt and 1.28mt the
previous year. Granma, the Communist Party newspaper, said the
increased production was due to new technology and injection of capital
and resources through linkups with foreign companies. Current
production was less than one-fifth of the country's total needs of
about 7.5mt a year. Cupet, the Cuban petroleum company, has been on an
investment drive overseas in an attempt to line up more joint ventures
with foreign oil exploration groups.

GOVERNMENT NAMES PRESIDENT OF PETROECUADOR

The government has named Patricio Lopez, an army general, as president
of Petroecuador. Lopez is a former aide-de-camp to President Sixto
Duran Bailen. He succeeds Federico Veintimilla, who stepped down
recently along with top managers after allegations of mismanagement.
Petroecuador produces 330,000 b/d of the Andes nation's 380,000 b/d. It
is now undergoing a major restructuring as a result of the top-level
cleanout, which led to the resignation of all managers at Petroecuador
subsidiaries, such as Petroproduccion, Petrocomercial and
Petroindustrial.

The alleged irregularities were in connection with the purchase of
27.5m gallons of diesel from Hiperoil, a local company which had
imported it from Venezuela. Hiperoil is claimed to have added undue
taxes to the sale price for a profit of 30bn sucres ($10.2m), reports
Reuters.

MEXICAN ENERGY MINISTER TO PRESS AHEAD WITH MODERNISATION

President Ernesto Zedillo has called on Jesus Reyes Heroles, the new
Energy Minister, to press ahead with a modernisation of the sector. He
said Jesus Reyes' main responsibility "will be to promote a rapid
expansion of the energy sector" and stimulating a quicker modernisation
of state-owned companies. Mexico is destined to sell a large part of
its petrochem industry this year. It has been under the control of
Petroleos Mexicanos. The country has already liberalised the natural
gas sector and expects billions of dollars in investment in natgas
transportation as well as in new power plants.

PROPOSAL TO DEVELOP GAS FIELD IN NORTHERN MEXICO

A consortium of US firm Conoco, Canada's Nova Corp and Canadian Hunter
Exploration have presented a proposal to develop a potentially enormous
natural gas field in northern Mexico, according to a report in the Wall
Street Journal. Under the terms of the proposal, made several months
ago, the group would agree a long-term service contract with Petroleos
Mexicanos (Pemex) to explore for and produce gas at Burgos Basin,
bordering Texas. The companies, which would be equal partners in the
deal, would initially invest $100m in the project.

If successful, the proposal, said to be in a very early stage of
discussion, would be taken as a signal that Mexico may relax its
restrictions on foreign involvement in the energy sector. Mexican law
currently forbids foreign ownership of its energy resources.

PETROPERU PLANS TO CUT WORKFORCE

Petroperu plans to cut its workforce before a stage-by-stage
privatisation later this year, the company says. "The programme . . .
foresees the retirement of excess personnel, to whom an economic
incentive will be given as well as legal benefits", it said. The idea
was to make the company's various divisions more efficient before
privatisation. Officials would not say how many of the company's 5,500
workers were likely to go, but speculation is that numbers could be cut
by 1,000 by July.

PERU'S OIL PRODUCTION

Peru's oil production fell 4.36% in 1995 from an average of 127,309 bpd
to 121,762 bpd, according to a report from regulatory agency Perupetro.
The fall was blamed on problems over the past few months with the
depletion of old wells before new wells came on-stream. Officials
expect the situation to improve in 1996, following last year's
signature of deals with foreign oil producers, and the start of a four-
year privatisation programme for Petroperu.

The country produced a total of 44.44m barrels in 1995 compared to
46.47m in 1994, said the report, with some 95.1% produced by state oil
firm Petroperu (14.54m bbl), Petro-Tech (7.09m) and US firm Occidental
Petroleum (20.64m). Private contractors accounted for the remaining
4.9%.

PDVSA PLANS TO INCREASE CRUDE RESERVES

PDVSA plans to increase crude reserves to 66bn bbl in 1996 from 64.4bn
this year, said PDVSA at its annual general meeting. It said it plans
to invest Bol 1.7 trillion next year ($5.86bn at the new official
exchange rate of Bol 290 per dollar in effect since December 11), up
from Bol 901.9m in 1995 ($3.1bn). Most investment will go into
production and exploration, said a company statement.

PDVSA said the programme will allow it to meet production targets "and
increase in 1996 proven reserves of crude to about 66bn bbl, or 1.6bn
more than 1995". PDVSA gave no figures for projected crude output
capacity or the budget that was approved. The company said recently
that its average production was rising to 5.659m b/d by 2005 compared
to 3.157m b/d now.

PDVSA expects oil output to be boosted further by the current
liberalisation programme. The company expects output from the ten
blocks being auctioned to reach at least 500,000 bpd by 2005, according
to president Luis Giusti. Some 60 companies in 20 consortia have bid
for the estimated $11bn of profit-sharing contracts. At the time of
going to press, two winners had been announced - a consortium of Mobil,
Veba and Nippon with a bid of $104m for La Ceiba tract, and Conoco,
bidding $21.2m for a second tract. The remaining concessions will be
announced by the end of January, with exploration beginning possibly by
the last quarter of1996.

VENEZUELA'S AMUAY REFINERY RECORD

Venezuela's Amuay refinery, the country's largest, processed 471,000
b/d last year, a 41,000 b/d rise over 1994, says Lagoven, a subsidiary
of PDVSA. It said that 100,000 b/d were heavy crude, which represented
a new record for the refinery, located in Falcon state. Venezuela
processed an average 972,000 b/d in 1994, say the latest figures. At
the same time, the Eastern Cyrogenic Complex, run by Corpoven, produced
an average of 34m b/d of LNG in 1995, up 9% over 1994. The PDVSA
subsidiary exported an average of 11m b/d of its LNG output, the
remaining 23m b/d sold domestically.

LITTLECHILD REDIRECTS 1998 PLAN

The Regulator has told the Pool and the ESI that it must redirect
efforts to finding a workable and economic arrangement for introducing
full competition in April 1998. He says that the estimated costs of
implementing and running the Pool's proposed Operational Framework are
neither reasonable nor necessary. Offer has proposed a number of
simplifications that it believes will facilitate implementation and
reduce costs. It believes that implementation costs should not exceed
#50m, while subsequent operating costs should be around #15m. These
costs are about one fifth of the Pool's estimates.

The difference in cost estimates reflects two factors:

* a real cost saving arising from abandoning some of the more complex
and expensive systems, most particularly the Pool's proposed
registration system;

* the Regulator's judgement that some of the costs incurred by the PESs
relate to activities that would in any case have to be carried out by
PESs in discharging their duties as distribution companies. Many of
these costs have already been provided for or else the additional costs
are not significant.

In addition to slashing the implementation costs that the industry will
be allowed to cover, Offer has told the industry that customers should
not face any additional charges before 1998. It recommends that
implementation costs should be recovered over five years from April
1998, with all <100kW customers paying in relation to their
consumption. The current non franchise sector would not have to
contribute to the implementation or running costs.

In many ways Offer's recommendations echo the call by a number of RECs
for a major re-think on how best to implement the 1998 project. Three
RECs, Southern Electric, Yorkshire Electricity and Midlands
Electricity, had in late December put forward an alternative framework,
which was dubbed the SYM proposal. This group called for the ESI to
abandon the implementation of the Pool's Operational Framework. It
argued that the industry should switch now, before it was too late, to
a simpler and more manageable programme that could be implemented in
time and yet would meet all the primary objectives.

The SYM plan backers are uncompromising in their criticism of the ESI's
current 1998 plans. They argued that the "Operational Framework
proposals are unlikely to be delivered on time. With a development cost
of #276m (+100%.-50%) and some #80m/yr to operate, it is so expensive,
it makes it very difficult for companies to accept. It also undermines
the benefit available to customers from competition."

They say that a simpler framework is needed in order to meet time-
scales. This must use existing systems, procedures and practices
wherever possible. Not only would this make implementation of full
competition a more manageable task, it would also substantially reduce
costs. They argue that there is no time to lose in pushing forward with
the alternative.

Offer's proposals

Stream-lined registration

Offer thinks that the Pool's registration system is unnecessarily
complex and that it would be more appropriate for the PES to provide a
registration service to meet the requirements of suppliers and the Pool
for all consumers in its area. It is prepared to propose licence
amendments to ensure that the PES fulfil these activities.

The Pool's proposed on-line registration system - the so-called Trading
System Data Provision (TSDP) and its associated Gateway - is generally
regarded as one of the more complex systems the Pool has proposed. The
TSDP would be made up of regional satellite databases (one per REC)
holding data necessary for trading. A common access path to the data
(the so-called Gateway) would allow all suppliers to access the data.
It is envisaged that eventually the system will provide on-line access.

The Regulator proposes a much simpler system based on a unique
identifier for every metering site, which would be printed on all
customers bills and would provide suppliers and others with necessary
information. PES would be responsible for assigning this metering
system identifier (MSID), which would give information on the
distribution exit point, profile, line loss factor and meter reading
frequency and perhaps other data. PESs would maintain databases of all
customers in their area as well as provide a service to respond to
enquiries from customers and suppliers. Suppliers would have an
obligation to alert the PES to any change, and in particular to
register their responsibility for supply to any premises. The PES
databases would also provide the Pool with standing data it requires
for settlement.

Regulatory safeguards, such as performance standards and penalties, are
likely to be required to ensure prompt and non discriminatory provision
of information.

Profiling

Offer accepts the Pool's proposals for eight profiles for 100kW
customers. And while its says that assignment of profiles has not been
a contentious issue, customers and suppliers should have the right to
seek independent determination where there is a dispute. The eight
profiles comprise two profiles each for domestic and smaller non-
domestic customers (unrestricted and Economy 7) and four profiles
(based on load factors) for larger non-domestic customers supplied
through conventional maximum demand metering.

Settlement

Under the Pool's current arrangements metered half hour data and
profiled data for all second tier customers is provided to the Pool's
agents for settlement, while first tier consumption is evaluated on a
grid supply point (GSP) basis as the difference between total second
tier use and total GSP take, suitably scaled for losses. The Pool's PTA
is that the existing arrangements for second tier data will continue
while PESs will be able to choose the basis by which they will submit
first tier consumption data to settlements. The option of continuing
the existing "differencing" approach has not been allowed for, as it
was considered to place too great a risk on PESs, should large numbers
of customers opt for second-tier suppliers.

Instead, the PTA allows the PES to select one of three trading options:

* Global: where the host PES submits customer data on an individual
site basis both for initial settlement and reconciliation, on the same
basis as second-tier suppliers;

* Super customer: where the host PES submits aggregated data for one or
more profile groups to initial settlement and reconciliation;

* Hybrid-difference: where the host PES submits individual customer
data on a global basis at initial settlement, but at the reconciliation
stage only meter data from second-tier customers is used.

The global approach is the most demanding in IT terms - if all RECs
adopted this approach settlement systems would have to handle data on
23m sites. The hybrid-difference approach is the most easiest, as most
of the aggregated data is not processed for Pool use. The super
customer lies in between.

As the amount of data provided for settlement increases so does the
cost, but this must be offset against reduced differencing risk. The
Pool's costings assume that all RECs adopt the global approach, in
order to avoid differencing risk.

Offer says that this is unreasonable and given the balance between
costs and risks there is no justification for adopting the global
option. Indeed in the initial period, Offer proposes that PESs must
stay with the existing differencing approach. It adds that PESs
pursuing the super customer or hybrid difference approach will not be
given an extra revenue allowance to meet the additional costs it and
the Pool incurs.

PESs should be obliged to provide data aggregation services to all
suppliers operating in their area on a non-discriminatory basis.
Suppliers could then decide whether to provide the data aggregation
service to the Pool themselves or through an independent accredited
agent or sub-contract their requirement to the host REC.

Half-hourly metering in reconciliation

The Pool's PTA allows for half hour metered data to be delivered to
outside settlement timescales. The Regulator endorses this as it allows
customers to benefit from half hour metering without installing on-line
communications. This will allow a wider range of tariffs than can be
offered to customers and will reduce the reliance on profiling
techniques for larger customers under 100kW.

Competition in metering and data collection

Offer has re-affirmed its view that suppliers should take
responsibility for metering and data collection in 1998. However in the
non half hourly metered sector of the market, the Offer has endorsed
the Pool's recommendation for a two-year transitional arrangement. This
will involve the supplier sub-contracting to the local PES (or its
agent), those data collection functions that are related to
conventional meters, at least in so far as they are necessary for
trading system purposes. Offer envisages that PESs would enter into
bilateral contracts with suppliers, which would set out the terms upon
which the data collection service would be provided. Any dispute about
terms would be subject to determination by the Regulator.

Parallels with SYM line

In essence the SYM proposal involves applying the existing trading
arrangements to all customers with half-hourly on-line meters, while
assigning responsibility for all other customers to the RECs
distribution businesses. Like Offer, the SYM scheme involves replacing
the Pool's centralised registration system with a simple one based on
PES distribution businesses, while the existing settlement process,
supplemented by a local aggregation and reconciliation system, will be
retained. PESs would continue to trade on the basis of differencing, as
Offer proposes for the initial period.

The Pool would continue to clear on a daily basis. All half-hour meter
data will continue to be processed through the current central
settlements system. This will include all the additional data from
mandatory and non-mandatory half hour meters.

For all non half-hour data, the REC distribution business would provide
a data aggregation and reconciliation service for all supply customers
in its area. Distributors would provide initial estimates of annual
consumption that will be used for settlement purposes. These estimates
would be updated following receipt of physical meter reading, validated
customer own readings or estimates carried out by the RECs' existing
estimating process.

Aggregated data would be fed to the initial settlement. This would be
carried out on a calender basis. In this way it would spread the
profile and line loss risk across all suppliers.

The reconciliation process, carried out between the host PES and second
tier suppliers, would be synchronised with the meter reading data flows
that feed it. The host PES would have to accept the difference risk,
which applies to a small margin between the published and out-turn line
loss factors. These would be small.

Unlike the Pool's proposal the SYM plan would not allow customers to
trade on the basis of half hourly data unless it is provided on-line
within settlement timescales. The SYM backers argue that since few
>100kW customers have chosen to take supply on multi-rate terms, the
gains from continuing to allow half hourly data to be processed outside
timescales, would be outweighed by the savings due to the simplified
settlement task. They point out that it would not be possible to cater
for data delivered outside settlement timescales due to the
differencing principle at reconciliation.

They say that their proposals would enable new suppliers to give
reliable quotations to prospective customers without direct involvement
with the existing supplier or distributor. Equally, the SYM backers
acknowledge that the main disadvantage is the reliance of non host PES
suppliers on effective regulation of host PESs' systems and procedures.
However these concerns can be addressed by appropriate licence
amendments and performance standards. SYM point out that suppliers
would be able verify meter readings on Pool statements against those
contained within DUoS (distribution use of system) statements.

On competition in data collection and metering in the conventional
metering segment, the SYM backers say that while the PES should retain
responsibility for this, there is no reason why actual data collection
and meter operation should not be carried out by third parties. This
would have to be subject to:

* current meter data flow being preserved (in other words the data
collector will have to send data to host REC - the data is anyway
required for billing suppliers' distribution use of system charge);

* data collector and meter operator parties having proper accreditation
and complying with codes of practice;

* maintenance of a evenly loaded quarterly cycle of data processing
(which might imply some data being stored prior to processing). This is
necessary in order that the reconciliation system is not overloaded.

Costs and risks

The cost saving in IT systems of the Offer and SYM alternative
frameworks are huge. The largest savings stem from the removal of the
need to develop new data collection and delivery systems, and to
provide half-hour profile data to the Pool trading system. In addition,
there would be savings in reduced programme management costs and trial
costs. While Offer puts the total implementation costs at under #50m,
SYM's estimate is #89m, and for a system that is more trimmed down than
Offer's. Similarly, SYM's estimate of annual operating costs, c.#25m is
substantially above Offer's.

Simplifying the operational framework will also ease the task of
implementing it, in terms of making development of IT systems more
manageable and also in terms of reducing legal re-drafting of the
Pooling and Settlement Agreement and other arrangement.

The SYM operational framework

Customer driven registration:

* Customer provides new supplier with information from bill.
* New supplier confirms supply to customer.
* New supplier registers customer with host PES registration
  service.
* New supplier sets up billing record.

Industry and customer reaction

The industry has still to digest the Regulator's proposals, which have
taken many by surprise. Many are pleased that Offer is taking a more
proactive stance and that it has at last outlined the principles for
cost recovery. But there is widespread feeling among the PES that Offer
has slashed too deeply into the PESs allowable implementation and
operating costs. Yorkshire's Bill Wilkinson, told Power UK that "On
first impressions, Offer's disallow any extra spend by distribution
businesses, which could be significant, is harsh especially if it
adopts an inflexible approach on ring fencing distribution and supply
businesses".

A number of PESs will certainly be unhappy that Offer will only meet
the costs of trading on a differencing basis, rather than meeting the
costs of alternative, more data-demanding, settlements arrangements.

National Power, PowerGen and the aspiring independent suppliers are
likely to welcome the Offer proposals, if they believe that they will
reduce the costs to customers of taking competitive supply. It does not
matter to them that PESs may find it difficult to keep costs to the
allowed levels, as long as the PES can deliver the required
registration and data aggregation services. However they are concerned
that no key competition elements should be lost in the effort to
simplify. NP's commercial director, Graham Brown told Power UK, "NP
welcomes any proposal that leads to lower costs that will eventually
feed through to the customer, but the industry must be careful not to
over simplify as this could jeopardise competition. We will be studying
the proposals closely".

Customers' representatives and buyers' groups are likely to support the
tougher Offer stance if it reduces the costs of taking competitive
supply. Yvonne Constance, the chair of the Electricity Consumers
Committee, backs the Regulator's decision to allow PESs to start
recovering implementation costs from 1998 rather than in advance.

Larger >100kW customers will be pleased that Offer has proposed that
PESs will be able to recover the implementation costs for 1998 from the
<100kW consumers. Also they will take some satisfaction that Offer has
told the PES that there should be no disruption in the trading
arrangements for the >100kW sector. The Utility Buyers Forum (UBF) only
last week called for a two-year postponement of the 1998 project on the
grounds that there were too many unresolved issues and too little time
to implement the necessary changes. Alan Mitchell Rae, UBF's director
general, said "that many of our members have sites which can
potentially benefit from competition but would rather have an orderly
transition and postpone these benefits than see more major upset
throughout the market."

UBF also say that neither the Regulator nor ESI had yet made a firm
business case for extending competition to residential customers. There
was instead an ideological commitment. According to Bob Spears, UBF's
electricity technical adviser, "its rather like the government
declaring that the UK will join the Single European Currency in 1998,
whatever the costs and benefits and whatever the level of
preparedness".

ESI WARNED OF "POLL TAX ON WIRES"

The ESI's current plans for introducing full competition in 1998 are so
deeply flawed that they could present a "poll tax on wires", according
to a new report by Alex Henney. Henney warns that the systems the Pool
and Offer have in mind are unnecessarily complex and costly, and that
the gains to be had from competition do not justify building a huge
centralised settlement system. He adds that, as with complex IT
systems, there is a more than even chance that they will exceed budget
and will not be more than ready in time. The solution, according to
Henney, is to ditch the current centralised system and develop a
decentralised system based on PESs' distribution businesses.

That this criticism should come Henney - a well known advocate of free
markets, an astute independent thinker, and former Electricity Council
economist, makes it all the more pertinent. That its conclusions are
largely endorsed by the breakaway RECs and now even Offer gives it a
radical manifesto flavour.

ESI's 1998 costs outweigh competition benefits

Henney contends that even if the Pool can contain the implementation
and running costs to the targets set out in its Operational Framework,
the costs may outweigh the benefits from competition. Adding the
operating costs (#80m) to the development costs (#250m, amortised over
four years on a 10% discount rate) and dividing by the number of
customers (23m), yields an annual cost per customer of #5.80. These
costs are about double the level implied by the Regulator, who has
stated that the costs are unlikely to exceed 1% of customers' bills,
which average #300/yr.

What riles Henney is the singular failure of the Regulator or industry
to examine the benefits side of the equation. Henney points out that it
is disengenuous to cite the reductions in prices that followed either
the  opening of the 1MW or 100kW markets as deriving from the effects
of head-to-head competition. The reductions owe more to the fact that
customers no longer had to subsidise British Coal through the REC's
vesting or "coal deal" contracts; and in 1994 to the imposition of
Offer's Pool price cap.

Henney argues that in order to see what the potential gains are it is
necessary to focus on the energy and supply business component of
bills. For a typical domestic customer these components amount to
#157/yr. The great bulk of this is energy (generation costs) with just
#27 accounted for by the supply business, including an average supply
margin of #7.40. This average does of course disguise a range of supply
costs, in the order of #10 for a customer on direct debit to #60 for a
poorly paying credit customer. There is also some variation between
RECs' franchise revenue allowances.

In theory, competition in supply will force suppliers:

* to reduce supply costs by improving efficiency in marketing and
billing through smarter IT systems or by sharing operations with other
utilities. Henney suggests that higher cost RECs could cut costs by 15%
(#6) while lower cost companies might trim costs by 10% (#3).

* to trim margins. The scope for trimming is extremely small given the
small margins: margins on domestic customers are unlikely to be much
over #5.

* to purchase energy more efficiently. With no data available on RECs'
purchasing skills/luck, Henney suggests that perhaps #1-2 might be
available. In addition, some RECs with expensive long-term IPP
contracts will no longer be able to pass the costs on customers, but
will be forced to take the above market cost on their supply business
bottom line. For a few RECs this could amount to #3.00 per typical
domestic customer.

Summing these potential benefits, gives a maximum potential reduction
of #11/customer (where the customer is served by a high cost REC and
poor buying). Expressed as a percentage of the typical bill this saving
is equivalent to 4% of the total bill (7% of energy costs). In an
average REC, potential savings may be nearer #7 or 3% of the total
bill.

These potential saving are not much greater than the costs, which
amount to near #6/customer. On this basis the potential net customer
benefit of competition is perhaps #2-3/customer. Henney questions,
whether in practice even these gains will be realised. Competition will
only bring price reductions where customers are prepared to switch to
take advantage of lower prices. The limited evidence that exists from
other commodity/utility markets and from other countries (most notably
Norway) suggests that the 3-4% savings on offer is unlikely to tempt
many residential customers buying singly to move. Unless residential
buyers are willing to delegate their purchasing to agencies purchasing
for many customers, it is difficult to see many domestic customers
gaining from competition.

Indeed, if the costs of the new systems come out nearer the top end of
the Pool's contingency forecast range (at c.#500m) most domestic
customers will pay for competition. Henney warns that residential
customers may not actually become aware of this situation, as these
increases should be more than offset by reductions elsewhere. The
biggest gain is likely to come with the ending of the RECs' coal backed
franchise contracts.

Complex systems don't always work

The cost-benefit balance looks even worse if the risks of system
failure are factored in. Henney warns that complex IT systems rarely
come in on time, to budget and without operational gliches. He cites
one recent survey of IT programmes in 200 organisations which showed
that 90% of projects were over budget, 60% delivered late and 20%
inappropriate for the task. In recent years there have been notable IT
failures including major system developed for the DHSS, Inland Revenue,
the London Ambulance Service and the Stock Exchange. The Pool's own
experience, albeit so far on a more modest scale, has hardly been
impressive. The Transmission Service Scheme implemented last year to
manage Uplift overshot its target cost by 150%. The proposed settlement
and registration systems are much more complex.

Regulator is key to forcing progress

Like many in the industry, Henney is also concerned about who, if
anyone, is taking responsibility for designing and implementing the
systems for full competition in 1998. He points out that the ESI has no
legal obligation nor financial allowance to design and develop the
systems for 1998. It is the Regulator who has the obligation to
"promote competition in the supply of electricity" and who also has
legal power to propose the necessary commercial framework.

Henney points out that a REC's primary duty is to its shareholders. In
fact it has a duty not to commit funds until such time as licences
obligations require it to do so. And they certainly cannot spend their
customers' money without Offer's authorisation, but as yet Offer has
made no allowance. This is hardly taking a proactive stance, as the
Regulator claims.

Build systems on PES distribution

Henney says that the Regulator should take control and reconstruct an
alternative streamlined programme based on existing distribution
business systems. He proposes an alternative systems that will:

* allow anyone to have half-hourly meters, and allow data to be
processed within or outside settlement timescales;

* build the necessary registration systems on the current system
developed for the current non-franchise market;

* produce pseudo half-hour data with a handful of profiles in the
manner currently proposed;

* use PES distribution businesses to effect local settlement and
reconciliation.

Henney says that adopting such an approach is not a jump into the
unknown, as Norway has already implemented such a system. And under the
current competitive market arrangements, RECs already know to whom each
meter relates and who the suppliers are as they have to recover DUoS
(distribution use of system) charges from suppliers.

Daily settlement through GSP (grid supply points) which is required by
the Pooling and Settlement Agreement (PSA) could be done for profiled
customers by RECs distribution businesses (for a fee) on behalf of all
suppliers in its area. The difference between profiled and metered
supply and final metered use (scaled for losses) would be allocated
proportionally among suppliers.

ENRON APPLIES FOR SUPPLY LICENCE

Enron has applied to the DTI for a second-tier supply licence for
England and Wales. It lodged its application on January 12. If it is
awarded a licence, which should be a formality, it will be able to
offer supply terms to any >100kW customer. The company is already
active in the gas supply business and would be expected to operate a
joint gas and electricity marketing operation.

Enron's application follows Norsk Hydro's successful application for
an STS licence on January 10. NH is now setting up an electricity
trading and supply arm, Norsk Hydro Energi (UK), under the direction of
Jamie Hamilton. Hamilton says he expects NHE to offer and trade CfDs
(contracts for differences) including EFAs (electricity forward
agreements).

NH has already has considerable experience as a supplier and trader in
the Nordic electricity market, which is of comparable size to the UK
market.

Hamilton joined NHE in December from National Power, where he was the
fuel strategy manager. Prior to that he was at Shell.

NH also has manufacturing interests in the UK, and around 2,000
employees.
Contact: Jamie Hamilton, Norsk Hydro Energi (UK), Tel. 0181 255 2510.

SOUTHERN MOVES INTO GAS SUPPLY

Southern Electric is to begin marketing gas to around 40,000 of its
customers in Somerset, who are in the first tranche of customers able
to choose their gas supplier from April 1996. The gas will be sold
through its associated company, Southern and Phillips Gas. Southern
already has extensive experience in the commercial gas market.

BG/HE GO AHEAD WITH SEABANK

British Gas and Hydro-Electric announced on January 22 that they had
formed a 50:50 joint venture, Seabank Power Limited (SPL), which will
construct and operate a 755MW CCGT plant at Avonmouth. The backers say
that the plant will be designed to operate profitably in the mid merit
segment of the market.

The total capital cost of the project is expected to #315m, which will
be funded equally by HE and BG, through a mix of shareholder loans and
equity in an 85:15 split.

HE has signed a power purchase agreement under which it will buy all
the electricity produced by the plant for the first 10.5 years. The
company will  also be responsible for providing fuel to SPL from its
gas portfolio, which has been augmented by a new contract with BG. This
additional gas is understood to have been purchased under a contract
that links the delivered gas price to electricity prices (Pool and
contract). This suggests that HE will be transferring a significant
part of the electricity price risk through to BG.

Siemens has been awarded the turnkey contract for design and
construction, with commercial operation scheduled for late 1998. The
plant will be based on two Siemens V94.3a 250MW gas turbines and a
single 255MW steam turbine, which will give an overall efficiency of
over 55% (on an LHV ISO basis). Firing will be solely by natural gas,
with no distillate backup.

The design configuration does allow space for further units. However,
the partners point out that the current 755MW represents the most
appropriate configuration, given the changing market circumstances
which have seen Seabank project scaled down from a >1.3GW baseload
scheme.

MISSION/EASTERN VIE FOR NP PLANT

Mission Energy is now the City's favourite to win control of the 4GW of
National Power coal capacity following the company's winning bid for
First Hydro. At more than #150m above the next highest bid, Mission's
winning bid is regarded as a strategic entry bid. Many in the City
believe that this acquisition is likely to feed Mission's hunger for
more capacity and a broader portfolio of plant. Industry sources, in
contrast still tend to put Eastern Group as favourite, as it too has
considerable financial muscle and strong ambitions to play a bigger
role in the UK generation sector.

AES and Enron are considered to be outside runners in the contest,
although both have significant interests in the UK generation sector.
But these companies should not be ruled out. Enron has always presented
itself as a clean generation company, so it was something of a surprise
when it declared an interest in the NP coal plant. While Enron have not
confirmed it, most observers (Power UK included) have assumed that
Enron interest in the plant on offer, is driven by the options for
converting or repowering the plant to run on gas.

NP's conversion of two sets at Didcot (1,000MW) indicates that NP at
least thinks there is an economic case for dual firing capability.
However, none of the three stations (West Burton, Ironbridge and
Rugeley) have connections to the gas network (as Didcot has), so the
conversion cost is likely to be somewhat more than the c.#10m (#10/kW)
for Didcot. But even if the cost were double or treble, a conversion
might pay, especially if low cost gas could be secured.

The gas break-even price with coal bought on the spot market (as
opposed to the headline "coal deal" price) is likely to be around 11-
12p a therm. This is achievable at present, but it would be a brave
investor who would count on prices remaining at current levels. This
suggests that if the plants are to have a future burning gas they will
have to be upgraded, which implies a commitment to invest much bigger
sums than a simple conversion. By installing gas turbines and modifying
the boilers and steam turbines, it would be possible to convert the
stations into combined cycle stations. Operating in this mode the
stations could achieve efficiencies of 45-48%, compared with about 38%
running in single cycle mode. The extra efficiency points would give a
higher break-even gas price versus coal, but then it comes at a
substantial investment price, some #200m for West Burton.

Switching to gas would, of course, bring considerable environmental
benefits, most particularly in reducing sulphur dioxide emissions.

PG BRINGS ON DISTA PRODUCTS CHP

PowerGen CHP has commissioned its 10MWe/16MWt combined heat and power
at Dista Products' Merseyside site two months ahead of schedule and
just over 15 months after construction started. The plant will be
operated by PG CHP for 10 years under a total energy management
contract. It comprises two 5MW Typhoon gas turbines provided by
European Gas Turbines and two waste heat boilers each supplying 11.5
tonnes of steam an hour.

PG CHP has also announced that it has won a contract to provide a #23m
gas fired CHP plant at Conoco's oil refinery on the Humber estuary. The
plant's four gas turbines will be supplied with natural gas by a spur
from the main Killingholme-Theddlethorpe line.

NT ALARMED BY ABB INTENTIONS

The National Trust (NT) has reacted with alarm to an approach by ABB
that it develop a 720MW CCGT on NT land adjoining an Exeter substation.
ABB argued that the plant could be appropriately designed and
landscaped to minimise visual impact. By siting the plant next to the
substation, the project would also avoid the need for further intrusive
transmission lines. This didn't wash with NT, which said that large-
scale power generation was incompatible with the NT's goal of
stewardship.

ABB says that the Exeter project had been little more than plucked off
the map - and the approach to NT the land-owners was the first time
that ABB had revealed its intentions. While it may represent a
misjudgment it certainly does not represent a setback for the company.
More importantly, it does indicate that generators are actively looking
for sites in the capacity-short zones of the Grid.

US oil giant Amoco, is also considering entering the UK generation
market. The company's electricity subsidiary, Amoco Power Resources
posted an invitation to tender for turnkey for a 250MW CCGT. Amoco told
Power UK that the company has several potential sites in mind, not just
in East Anglia as mentioned in the Official Journal, and that it needed
price quotes from equipment companies in order to carry out its
economic assessments.

Amoco's invitation to tender follows a series placed by Enron Europe in
December 1995, for various CCGT components for an unspecified site in
the north west of England. The supply contracts includes a 240MW gas
turbine, high pressure steam boilers and one or more back-pressure 75MW
steam turbines and one or more heat recovery steam generators.

Enron would not comment on the site for the plant, but did confirm that
the CCGT in question would be suitable for a combined heat and power
application.

The rating of the plant and the northwest site suggest that Enron is
bidding to provide CHP facilities at Brunner Mond or at ICI Runcorn.

CCGT GENERATION GROWTH SLOWS IN 1995

Current industry estimates are that total CCGT generation in England
and Wales in 1995 reached just over 45TWh. This compares with
projections of over 50TWh made at the beginning of the year. CCGT
generation in 1994 was 36TWh, indicating a 25% increase in 1995.

The lower than expected growth in generation is largely due to the
delayed commissioning of several major new CCGT plants - (most notably,
Little Barford (National Power), Keadby (Hydro-Electric/Norweb) and
Medway (AES, Seeboard and Southern).

Keadby has just this week completed handover (from John Brown
Engineering, the construction contractor). Handover had been originally
scheduled for last summer, but vibration problems meant that the
commissioning programme was disrupted. It is the same story at the
other two stations. Medway now reports, as do the others, that its two
turbines are running fine. However, it does not now expect to complete
handover until late summer, almost a year behind the original scheduled
date. None of the companies would comment on who has borne the burden
of the delay costs, but industry rumours suggest that GE has covered a
substantial portion.

With these three plants now running and with PowerGen's 1,400MW
Connah's Quay expected on in the summer, and a full year's output from
Barking, CCGT generation should exceed 70TWh in 1996.

WELLHEAD GAS GENERATOR SET TO TRADE BELOW GSP

Independent Energy UK, a small West Midlands-based energy company is
set to begin operations at its first on-shore wellhead gas power plant
that will export power onto the local distribution network. The first
plant, due on in April will only be rated at 1MW, but IEUK's commercial
director John Sully, says that the company has licences for several on-
shore sites. He expects to have 30-60MW of generation capacity across
the Midlands within a year.

IEUK has been born from a merger of Ipsco, an oil industry servicing
company, and EUKAN, a small gas company with several on-shore gas
concessions. By diversifying into generation, Sully, who recently
joined from Scottish Power's energy trading arm, says the company is
able to exploit the added value of moving downstream. Sully adds that
the vertical integration does not need to stop at generation and that
IEUK intends to be an active trader in electricity and gas. The company
is also likely to apply for a second-tier supply licence.

COAL GENS TO FACE ONE RAIL COMPANY

The success of Wisconsin Central Transportation in winning all three of
the rail-freight concerns means that the English coal generators will
again face a single railway carrier. Coal industry sources fear that
the generators and coal suppliers will see their bargaining position
weakened, so railage costs could increase which would feed through to
higher fuel costs. National Power is best placed among the generators
as it already has acquired several train sets and has options with
suppliers which would cover its full coal needs.

NEW YEAR SEES PRICE TUMBLE

The run up to Christmas saw a step gear change in the generators bids
which as seen PPP (Pool Purchase Prices) over the last four weeks of
slightly over 2p/kWh, versus an average level from mid November to mid
December of over 6p/kWh. The capacity component of prices has in the
last three weeks (business days) has been just 0.3p/kWh, an order of
magnitude less than the level seen prior to the pre-Christmas tumble.
SMP (system marginal prices) have also come down) to around 2.2p/kWh
versus 3.25p/kWh.

The fall in prices to some extent reflects an increase in available
capacity, especially this month as Nuclear Electric has brought all bar
two of it reactors back on line. As last year, however, the major part
of the reduction reflects a marked change in genco bidding, as the
companies endeavour to make a effort to stop both the time and demand
weighted price caps being broken by a large margin.

Financial year to date prices (PPPs) are still below the cap. As of
January 18, the demand-weighted average is 2.65p/kWh versus a cap of
2.694p/kWh. The time-weighted average is 2.34p/kWh, compared with
2.535p/kWh.

On present trend the time-weighted cap is likely to be under shot by a
significant margin, while it is touch and go as to whether the demand-
weighted cap will be exceeded. The sense of deja vu is obvious, but
this time the generators know the extent to which they can attribute
the failure to meet the cap to "unpredictable events". Some observers
have suggested that this year the generators will be less concerned to
err on the side of caution.

MCILDOON CALLS FOR COMPETITION

Douglas McIldoon, the Northern Ireland Regulator, has reaffirmed NI
Offer's desire to see greater competition in the Province's generation
and wholesale supply businesses*.

In a report, his first since taking office in November last year,
McIldoon reviews the predicament that NI faces in terms of the vesting
structure - particularly the long-term must-take generation contracts.
McIldoon says that even "if NI can avoid to pay for new capacity during
the next seven years, and particularly if the adverse effect of the
Ballylumford gas contract can be minimised, the prospects are for
prices being broadly stable - subject to coal, oil and gas prices not
moving dramatically upwards." But as energy prices are already above
those in the rest of the UK, prices need to be cut, if the Province is
not to miss the opportunities provided by the development of a more
peaceful society.

McIldoon has proposed a number of possible steps that might be taken to
extend competition, which he says are in line with the draft European
Directive on liberalisation of the electricity market and the
government's tenet that customers should pay the full cost of the
energy they consume.

* Ending of Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE)'s power procurement
monopoly. This requirement has already been relaxed for self-generation
projects, but it is possible that once the termination dates for genset
contracts are reached the generators could be freed to sell to
suppliers and customers of their  choice. This could lead to a gradual
expansion of independently contracted generation from as early as this
year if Offer exercises its termination rights on the generation
contracts. However, the earliest termination dates for the bigger
stations, Kilroot and Ballylumford, are not until 2010 (Power UK
10/17). On this basis Belfast West (240MW) could be brought fully into
the independent sector by 2000, with Coolkeeragh joining in 2004. New
independent generators and self-generators would also be allowed to
trade direct to customers and suppliers of their choice.

In order that this could work effectively it would be a logical step to
allow independent generators access to the grid. However, in order that
there was not an excessive build of capacity that could leave NIE with
considerable stranded capacity, the Regulator has suggested that there
might need to be  limits on independent generation. This could be on
the basis of MW ratings of independent and self-generation sites or
restrictions to CHP or renewable generators.

* Allowing independent power lines. There may be scope for allowing
independent generators to construct direct power links to dedicated
customers, but this would have to be weighed against the environmental
impact of such links.

* Liberal interconnector trading. The North-South interconnector could
also be available both for certain customers in NI to buy directly from
the Electricity Supply Board (ESB) or for NI generators to sell
directly to ESB's power procurement business.

* Stimulating the market for energy efficiency. This would include
measures to improve availability and accessibility of energy efficient
appliances, information and awareness campaigns, and soft financing
packages for energy efficiency schemes.

* Renewable energy. New arrangements could be implemented to create a
market for renewable energy. This would take the initial cost of
securing further capacity out of the general tariffs.

* CHP. It is important to ensure that CHP competes on equal terms with
electricity only plant. Removing some current distortions could lead to
new CHP schemes being developed. The Regulator says a paper on this
will be published later.

* Supply competition. While there is no protected franchise in NI,
second-tier suppliers have made no impression in the market place. This
almost certainly reflects the dominant position of NIE as the sole
power procurement body. Once that goes supply competition may blossom.

McIldoon concedes that there is no head to head competition in
generation at present and that the existence of the long-term contracts
ties the Regulator's hand on what can be proposed. He has indicated
that he will want to discuss with the generators and NIE the
possibility of revisiting the vesting contracts. However, the chases of
unscrambling the vesting stitch are must be slim as the generators hold
all the aces.

DTI CLEARS CSW BID FOR SEEBOARD

The DTI has decided not to refer Central and South West (CSW)'s #1.6bn
bid for SEEBOARD to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. This is the
first bid to be approved since trade secretary Ian Lang referred the
bids of National Power and PowerGen to the MMC in November. Lang said
that CSW had given assurances that it would provide the regulator with
all the information he required and that the REC would retain its
financial independence.

CSW's bid is the fifth REC takeover to be cleared. The five approved
bids also include Southern Electric International's for SWEB, Hanson's
for Eastern Group, Scottish Power's for Manweb and North West Water's
for Norweb.

Ian Lang, industry minister, has also decided not to refer the proposed
acquisition of South Wales Electricity (SWALEC) by Welsh Water plc to
the Monopolies & Merger Commission. In making this decision, Lang took
the advice of Offer, the Office of Fair Trading and Ofwat (the water
industry regulator), all of which saw no case for referral on
competition grounds.

Welsh Water has given the DTI assurances that if the proposed
acquisition of SWALEC is successful it will agree to licence
amendments, on financial ring fencing, provision of adequate financial
and management resources and regulatory access to information.

HE FACES TOUGHER SUPPLY STANDARD

Offer has set a tougher target for improvements in the quality of
supply provided by Hydro-Electric over the next five years. The target
for 1999/2000 is for 105 customer minutes for lost supply, arising from
faults in the company's HV distribution network. This represents a 16%
improvement on the 10-year average figure of 125 minutes. The tougher
targets were recommended by the Monopolies & Mergers Commission
published in June last year.

UNDERGROUND STARTS TENDER PROCESS

London Underground Limited (LUL) has formally started the tender
process for a 30-year supply contract to cover its power needs, by
posting notice of the contract in the European Union's Official
Journal.

LUL says the contract would be expected to cover the
refurbishment,operation and maintenance of the company's distribution
network and the provision of DC and AC supplies (either imported or
generated). Presently, total annual electricity consumption amounts to
900GWh. (PUK 17/3).

The company says that a decision to award a contract, which will be
performance-based, is expected to be made by the end of 1996. The
decision will depend on there being a sound business case for
contracting out. A short-list of companies is expected to be drawn up
by end March. The contract is being pursued under the UK government's
Public Finance Initiative.

NATPOWER TO CUT #60M FROM COSTS

National Power has announced that it intends to cut it's annual
operating costs by around #60m following a major review of its non
power station activities. The cost savings are expected to be phased
in, #40m in 1996/97 and #60m in 1997/98, both compared with current
costs. As part of the cost cutting, the company expects to shed around
400 jobs in non power station areas. Most of the job losses will be at
the company's Swindon offices, where around 1,400 staff are employed.

NP says that its renewed cost drive is a response to increasing
competition in the generation and supply businesses, and the expected
reduction in the company's generating capacity following disposal of
4GW of coal fired plant.

* NP's director of fuel management, Keith McNair is leaving the
company. He is returning to the US where he will join CSX. One of the
country's major railroad concerns, as a board-level troubleshooter.

BE PRIVATISABLE ONLY AT TAXPAYERS' EXPENSE SAY MACKERRON AND SADNICKI

On the basis of a detailed station-by-station analysis a new study by
Gordon MacKerron and Mike Sadnicki concludes that the privatisation of
British Energy is unlikely to achieve anywhere near the government's
target of #2.6bn. MacKerron and Sadnicki (M&S)'s results show that
taking a prudent investor's view and applying conventional nuclear
industry discounting practice (whereby liabilities are discounted at a
low (2%) rate), yields a net present value (NPV) of minus #2.6bn. If
the operational discount rate is applied to liabilities that will be
discharged over the operating life of stations, then the NPV is raised
to just over #0.8bn.

The authors argue that investors are likely to take the latter
approach, as there is little commercial reason to treat cash outflows
to meet operational expenses any differently from cash spent on
discharging liabilities. On this basis, investors will see a positive
value for BE.

But M&S point out that this valuation adopts the nuclear industry's
estimates of liabilities and that there are reasons to believe these
could be substantial under-estimates. They claim this is the case with
AGR waste liabilities, where the industry estimates are #0.7bn (#0.3bn
discounted) compared with their own estimate of #6.6bn (#3.6bn
discounted) (- see below). If investors believe waste liabilities are
nearer the M&S estimates than the industry's own estimates this would
of course take the NPV well into negative values. And there are other
potential downside risks, most notably on station performance and
electricity sales price.

Just how the government has come up with its #2.6bn valuation is
unclear as the DTI has provided no hints as to the cost and performance
assumptions nor the discounting approach. M&S suggest that there are
two ways in which such a high value can be achieved, using their cost
and performance assumptions.

* by applying a 6% discount rate to both operational and liability cash
streams, or;

* by unloading liabilities related to pre-1996 operations.

M&S point out that KPMG adopted a 6% discount rate when evaluating
liabilities management options in its report to the DTI as part of the
government's Nuclear Review in 1994. The 6% rate is the lowest public
sector test rate. But the authors argue that it is inappropriate to use
such a low rate, and the government itself advocates a 10% hurdle rate
where public sector concerns sells their output in a competitive market
place. M&S use a 13% discount rate. They argue this is consistent with
what National Power and others had advocated in nuclear review
submissions, and is also the outcome of applying a capital asset
pricing model.

Waste liabilities likely to top #6bn

M&S say that the nuclear industry's estimates of waste liabilities
could be out by an order of magnitude. This conclusion is based on an
analysis of the components of waste costs. According to the authors,
waste liabilities include:

* packaging, storage and disposal of low level waste (LLW);

* disposal at NIREX of intermediate level waste (ILW) produced by
Thorp;

* packaging, storage and disposal at NIREX of ILW produced at stations.

Using data on a US disposal site M&S estimate LLW costs to amount to
#376m.

M&S's assumptions on valuation

* AGR load factors will on average be lower than achieved in the
  last two years, at 69.6% (versus 75.8% and 71.6% in 1993/94 and
  1994/95), but will be higher than the average over the last six
  years, 64.7%.
* Sizewell B load factor will be 70%.
* Station life will be 30 years for Dungeness B, Heysham 1 and
  Hartlepool and 35 for the other four AGRs, while Sizewell B's life
  is 40 years.
* Present capacities will be maintained.
* Average sales price for electricity is 2.5p/kWh.
* Station fuel costs are 0.45p/kWh.
* Non-station operating and maintenance (ORM) costs will fall 5%/yr
  until 2000, and then remain fixed, while station ORM costs are
  assumed stable across the station life.
* Marginal reprocessing costs are estimated to be #598,000 a tonne
  of uranium.
* AGR decommissioning costs amount to #560m per station based on the
  industry's "reference strategy", rather than the "deferred
  safestore" option.
* Annual operating costs of Sizewell B are #90m.
* AGR waste liabilities are estimated to be #0.7bn undiscounted,
  based on estimates by the NUCG (Nuclear Utilities Chairmans'
  Group) and Fred Pallant.
* A 13% discount rate is applied to operational cash streams, while
  a two alternative rates are applied to liabilities (2% and 13%) to
  produce two base case valuations, which M&S call the conventional
  and innovative.

ILW disposal is costed on the basis of the fully built up costs of the
NIREX repository which is assumed to be available by 2011. Using a 6%
discount rate, capital cost of #1.88bn and an annual operating cost of
#15m M&S estimate a disposal cost of #28,000 a cubic metre. This figure
is a factor of three to four times higher than any industry estimate.
Applying this figure to the rate of waste generation, making allowance
for stockpiled waste and adding on waste packaging and transport costs
gives a total ILW disposal cost of #4.7bn.

Plutonium storage costs are estimated on the basis that little
plutonium will be used in making mixed oxide fuels. Taking the AGR
plutonium generation rates and applying US data on storage costs yields
a storage cost which averages almost #50m annually in the period up to
2030. M&S say that these costs are so high that they cut off their
calculation at 2030, on the assumption that the industry would find a
lower cost disposal route. Taking costs up to 2030 gave a total
undiscounted plutonium storage cost of #1.65bn.

Summing these costs together gives a total waste storage and disposal
cost of #6.737bn. When discounted the figure is reduced to #3.6bn.

The City will undoubtedly look closely at the M&S report, as it
provides by far the best bottom up analysis of costs. Not everyone will
agree with the approach adopted or the assumptions. Most analysts
concur with M&S that investors are likely to discount operational and
liability cash flows at the same rate at least over the life of
stations, but several point out that the NPV of the assets is only just
the beginning of the valuation process. They argue that until the
capital structure, tax rules and any government guarantees on risks are
known it is very difficult to put a value on BE. There is also the
issue of terminal value, which is particularly thorny issue for a
nuclear generator. Intuitively, many would say the terminal value must
be negative, due to the high back-end liabilities. Not so, says John
Reynolds, of James Capel, who argue the value could be significantly
positive, if BE is able to generate new assets. Reynolds also says that
the expected stable market share over the next decade gives BE an
advantage over the gencos, which could largely offset the nuclear risk
premium on the discount rate.

ELECTRIC RESTRUCTURING: ELCON Releases Its Blueprint For The Future

The Electricity Consumers Resource Council (ELCON), a Washington,
D.C.-based trade association representing large industrial
customers, has released its "Blueprint for Customer Choice," which
it believes contains the economic and regulatory frameworks, as
well as legislative reforms needed for the emergence of real
competition in the electric industry.

ELCON advocates removal of federal and state impediments to market
entry by any entity that seeks to provide or purchase products or
services presently offered as a bundled service by utilities. ELCON
believes that only a minimum of physical assets and services need
be regulated to ensure the reliable operation of the grid. It wants
all market segments to be unbundled. But while generation service
should not be regulated, the rates, terms, and conditions for use
of transmission and distribution facilities that continue to be
provided as monopoly services should be regulated.

Existing contractual relationships between native load customers
and their utilities, and between utilities and their suppliers,
should be honored. But ELCON advocates that utilities mitigate
stranded costs by writing off or writing down those assets against
earnings, by the sale of those or other nongenerator assets, by
renegotiating purchased power or fuel supply contracts, and by cost
reductions. No utility should be allowed to seek recovery of any
costs associated with uneconomic assets that were incurred
subsequent to enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct).
ELCON desires creation of an independent system operator, splitting
the traditional distribution functions between a "wires" business
and the electric services merchant business, and creation of a
federal-state joint board to recommend actions to state
legislatures.

Cynthia Mansfield, a General Public Utilities Vice President, and
a leader of the PURPA Reform Group, expressed dissatisfaction that
ELCON would deny utilities recovery of prudently incurred costs
associated with uneconomic assets committed to after passage of
EPAct, yet require utilities to continue buying PURPA power for the
indefinite future. Mansfield claimed that ELCON's proposal to
extend PURPA benefits to all producers and consumers who had
achieved PURPA qualifying status by the beginning of the transition
period, would increase stranded costs.

GAS TRANSPORTATION: Bay State Gas To Offer New Programs

The Massachusetts commission has approved a settlement authorizing
Bay State Gas Co. (BSG) to redesign its gas rates and launch a
residential unbundling pilot program, believed by BSG to be the
first of its kind offered in New England.

The pilot will allow participating residential customers to buy
natural gas transportation service from BSG, while choosing gas
suppliers. The program will be conducted in three phases of
development, pilot implementation (by heating season of 1996), and
program assessment.

The settlement will enable BSG to introduce new rates that more
closely reflect the actual costs associated with serving different
customer classes. New rates became effective January 1, 1996.

Other components of the utility's rate redesign will be aimed at
making transportation service from BSG more attractive to a larger
group of commercial and industrial customers. (Presently only 100
of BSG's largest customers buy unbundled transportation service).
Specifically, BSG will offer supplemental gas supply service during
the winter period to meet seasonal demand. Also, it will offer
`needle peaking' service to help commercial and industrial
customers guard against supply shortfalls during the coldest days
when marketers may be unable to guarantee deliveries.

CREDIT RATINGS: Moody's: Northeastern Utilities Are Under Pressure

Moody's Investors Service has released a report, "Northeast Break-
Even Analysis," which foundsthat while wide variations exist in the
cost structures of investor-owned, municipal, and state electric
utilities in the Northeastern United States, that in a deregulated,
price competitive market for electricity, a solid majority of the
utilities would be at a significant disadvantage in relation to
their peers in contiguous regions. If full competition is
introduced, Moody's concluded that Northeastern utilities with
above average costs likely would experience deterioration in credit
quality as some investments are unrecoverable from ratepayers.

Moody's defines the Northeast competitive arena as all major rated
utilities within two transmission interconnects of Consolidated
Edison Co. of New York. It includes 25 IOUs in nine states, as well
as two public power and two Canadian utilities. They represent over
$153 billion in combined assets, $29.7 billion in combined equity,
and over $48 billion in annual revenues.

Moody's said that most of the utilities have the highest "break-
even" prices in the nation. (Moody's defines break-even as the
price a utility must charge for each unit of capacity to cover its
fixed charges after applying all profits or margins from its energy
sales. Because Moody's generating cost model is a residual
analysis, differences in relative cost position are magnified,
which allows for meaningful comparisons among utilities).

Moody's estimated $43 billion in stranded costs in this region
alone, which accounts for about one quarter of all U.S. stranded
costs.

Regulatory initiatives remain at the information gathering stage,
with principles for guiding an orderly transition to competition in
place in New York, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island (see Weekly No.
3234). They are in the process of being developed or endorsed in
New Hampshire, New Jersey, Vermont and Maine (see weekly Nos. 3228,
3230, 3234). Moody's noted that Pennsylvania is leaning toward a
"wait and see" approach, with a recent PUC staff recommendation
suggesting that it is not yet time for extreme change.

Based on average price assumptions, Moody's found that only Hydro-
Quebec would be able to cover all fixed costs and earn a profit
through energy sales alone. Hydro-Quebec and the New York Power
Authority fell at the low end of the scale, with negative break-
even prices, reflecting much hydrogeneration. At the high end of
the price scale are United Illuminating, Long Island Lighting Co.,
and Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric Co-op. Moody's said
it expects downgrades to continue for utilities in the Northeast,
especially due to negative transition cost decisions and definitive
moves toward open access.

ELECTRIC RATES: S.Carolina E&G Pleased With Ruling

The South Carolina PSC has approved a $67.5 million (7.34%) retail
electric rate hike for South Carolina Electric & Gas Co. (SCEG), to
be phased-in over a two-year period. SCEG had requested a $76.7
million (8.35%) increase.

The approved rates are based on a 12% return on common equity,
resulting in an overall return on rate base on 9.59%. The Phase 1
increase of about $59.5 million (6.47%), will become effective upon
completion and commercial operation of SCEG's new, 385-Mw, coal-
fired Cope generating plant, expected January 15, 1996. The total
capital cost of the plant is expected to be about $436 million
(including AFDC), which is under the original budget of $537
million. About one-half of the plant's total capital cost already
is included in base rates due to a June, 1993 order. The PSC now
approved recovery of remaining capital costs and annual operating
expenses associated with Cope.

Also included in Phase 1 is a $4.3 million increase for a storm
damage reserve account, that will be capped at $50 million and
collected through rates over a ten-year period.

The PSC granted SCEG's request to accelerate recovery of almost all
its regulatory assets, and to shift about $257 million of
depreciation reserves from its transmission and distribution assets
to nuclear production assets. The latter change will enhance its
competitive position by reducing the cost of its nuclear
generation.

INTERNATIONAL ACQUISITIONS: Moody's Finds U.K. Deal Manageable

Moody's Investors Service has lowered the commercial paper rating
for Central and South West Corp. (CSW) from `P-1' to 'P-2' in
response to significantly greater leverage assumed by CSW to
acquire SEEBOARD, a regional electric distribution company located
in Great Britain.

The CSW bid valued SEEBOARD at $2.5 billion, and Moody's said it
finds the additional debt manageable given the good competitive
position of CSW's U.S. utilities, and the generally stable business
outlook for SEEBOARD. But Moody's expects the increased leverage to
put some strain on CSW's cash flow, reducing overall financial
flexibility.

CSW plans to fund the acquisition 60% through nonrecourse bank
debts raised in the U.K., and 40% through an equity contribution
from the U.S. parent corporation. It has negotiated an $850 million
unsecured bank facility to raise funds for the equity contribution.

ELECTRIC FUTURES: NYMEX Looks Forward To Approval

The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) expects approval of its
two West coast electric futures contracts by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (CFTC) this month, and anticipates launching
them before the second half of 1996.

The futures, the first ever for electricity, have the same delivery
terms but one has a delivery point at the California-Oregon border,
while the other is at Palo Verde, Arizona.

Meanwhile, the two proposed electric options contracts, which are
based on the futures contracts, are expected to receive CFTC
approval later in 1996.

DISCOUNT RATES: Vermont Customers to Get Break

Green Mountain Power Corp. (GMP) has asked the Vermont commission
to approve a one-year pilot electric discount program, which would
be available to residential and small business customers who use
more electricity in 1996 than they did in 1995.

The program is aimed at GMP's smaller customers and would provide
a 25% discount on electricity use that exceeds the amount a
customer used during the previous year. The discount would be
limited to 15% of additional electricity use, and customers would
not have to sign up for the program but instead would automatically
qualify.

"Qualifying customers can take advantage of the discount without
increasing the cost to other customers, said GMP President and CEO
Douglas G. Hyde. "That is because there is a surplus of electricity
in new England, and we are giving out customers an opportunity to
take advantage of this unusual energy situation," Hyde added.

NATURAL GAS PIPELINES: Nixed Sale Leads To New Deal

Tenneco Energy (TE) has agreed to sell its 50% interest in the Kern
River natural gas pipeline system to the Williams Companies, Inc.
for $205 million. The companies are joint venture partners in the
Wyoming to California pipeline.

The plan came about after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ruled
at the end of December that the sale by TE of its 50% interest to
Questar Pipeline could result in market power by Questar in the
Salt Lake City area (see Weekly No. 3235). But the new sale plan
still requires FTC approval.

"Based on discussions with our partner, Williams over the past few
days, we concluded it was in Tenneco's best interest to avoid the
time and expense involved in restarting the bidding process, and go
ahead and finalize the terms of the transaction before year end,"
said Steve Chesebro', TE Chairman and CEO.

LEAST-COST PLANNING: Oregon PUC Finds Idaho Power Reasonable

The Oregon PUC on December 29 acknowledged Idaho Power Co.'s (IP)
least-cost plan, which implements new conservation programs and
system efficiency improvements, continues efforts to relicense its
hydroelectric plants, and continues solar and windpower
development.

PUC acknowledgement of a least-cost plan means that the plan seems
reasonable to the PUC at the time, but favorable ratemaking
treatment is not guaranteed. It gives considerable weight in the
ratemaking process to utility actions that are consistent with
acknowledged plans.

TELEPHONE COMPETITION: Colorado Works On Local Rules

The Colorado PUC is beginning hearings this month on proposed rules
to open the local telephone market to competition beginning July 1.
The proposed rules would implement state legislation passed last
year instructing the PUC to open up local service to competition.

For six months, various working groups have attempted to agree on
interconnection and number potability, resale, high cost funds, 911
services, and certification. Each group drafted a set of proposed
rules, and consensus was reached in the areas of 911 requirements
and certifications. More than one set of proposed rules were
drafted for the other areas, and the PUC need by law only give
substantial deference to those rules where consensus was reached.
The hearings run through March, with an initial decision expected
in early April, and a final decision by May 31.

ELECTRIC COMPETITION: Tribal Choice Causes Lawsuit

Madison Gas and Electric Co. (MGE) on January 3 filed a lawsuit in
court and a complaint at the Wisconsin PSC against Wisconsin Power
& Light Co. (WPL), because WPL will provide electricity to a Native
American tribe's bingo hall to be located in MGE territory (see
Weekly No. 3232).

WPL on December 1, 1995 had won the bid to provide service to the
tribe. Although present state law only allows provision of service
by a certificated utility in its own service territory, the tribe
has raised the argument that it is excluded from the law because it
is a sovereign nation.

In court, MGE has asked for treble actual damages -- lost margins
on electric sales made by WPL. MGE also asked for punitive damages
and award of attorneys' fees. At the PSC, MGE asked it to require
WPL to remove any electric lines and related plant from  MGE's
service territory.

INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATORS: FERC To Hold Technical Conference

The FERC on January 4 announced that as part of its electric
transmission open access NOPR, it would hold a technical conference
on independent system operators (ISO) and reform of power pools
under the federal power act. The conference will be held January 24
at 9:30 A.M. at the FERC.

The FERC said that at its December 5 and 6, 1995 conference on
comparability for power pools, that several speakers had described
proposals for developing ISOs as one method to address full
competition. It wants to (1) define the essential elements and
operational characteristics of an ISO; (2) explore principles to be
used in reforming power pools; and (3) explore utility formation of
ISOs.

Electricity -- Flexible Rates

The Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities has approved a new
"market-based" electric tariff for Fitchburg Gas & Electric Co., a
combined electric and gas utility. The new Energy Bank Service
offers rates for new or expanding industrial customers that are
priced competitively with average industrial rates in the United
States.  While the utility had supported the new rate offering as
consistent with the state's restructuring goals of greater customer
choice and access to wholesale market prices, the department
rejected the utility's position that the new discount customers
should be exempted from any specific stranded cost charges in the
future.

According to the company, it currently has no excess capacity and
intends to meet the power requirements for the new service offering
form wholesale markets through short-term contracts of one month or
less.  The department said that utility's proposal deserved
stricter scrutiny than other discount proposals recently approved
for utilities who had extra power to sell. Nevertheless, it found
that revenues would more than offset incremental power costs and
separate fuel procurement and accounting procedures devised by the
utility would allow the department to determine whether the new
service offering affected costs for other ratepayer groups. The
department also directed the company to include in the new tariff
a statement that the structure and design of the new rate might
change as a result of the implementation of a restructuring plan
for the utility. Re Fitchburg Gas and Electric Co., D.P.U. 95-75,
Nov. 30, 1995 (Mass.D.P.U.).

The Missouri Public Service Commission has turned down a request by
Kansas City Power and Light Co., an electric utility, for approval
of a generic tariff for special contract offerings to its large
industrial customers. The proposed service would have allowed the
utility to "flex down" from rates in its established Primary Large
Service tariff in order to meet a competitive threat. The utility
had proposed to limit availability of the discount service to
customers with demands of 1,000 kW or greater who are faced with
competition from other energy suppliers. It would have provided the
service at a rate not less than the greater of 1.3 cents per kwh on
an annual average basis or its annualized incremental cost per kwh.
The commission rejected allegations that special rate contracts
were unlawful and also ruled that the protection of confidential
business information associated with the contracts was within its
authority, but it concluded that a generic tariff for discounts
should be considered as part of an investigation of the utility's
overall rate design. Nevertheless, the commission found that the
type of competition currently facing the utility could require a
"bundled service" offering of the type suggested by the utility. It
also said that an unbundled service offering with a price ceiling
and price floor for each service component might also be necessary
in "preparation for the full range of competition" in the utility's
service territory. Re Kansas City Power and Light Co., Case No. EO-
95-181, Dec. 6, 1995 (Mo.P.S.C.).

Electric Industry Restructuring

The Maine Public Utilities Commission has launched a formal inquiry
into the restructuring of the electric industry in the state. The
state legislature had allotted the commission a one-year period,
beginning on January 1, 1996, to develop at least two plans for the
transition to a competitive retail electric market including: (1)
a plan to achieve full retail market competition by the year 2000
and (2) a plan to achieve retail competition "wherever effective
competition is likely" while maintaining regulation where
necessary. Under the legislative mandate the commission is required
to provide a range of estimates of stranded investment associated
with each restructuring proposal.  the commission seeks comments on
a variety of issues including whether rate decreases can be
expected  and whether retail competition would provide benefits to
consumers that cannot be obtained through enhanced wholesale
competition.  Re Electric Utility Industry Restructuring, Docket
No. 95-462, Dec. 12, 1995 (Me. P.U.C.).

Mergers -- Rate Increases

The Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission has turned
back a pre-merger attempt by Puget Sound Power and Light Co. to
make permanent a $165.5 million rate increase allowed under its
periodic rate adjustment mechanism (PRAM), a ratemaking clause
designed to remove disincentives to utility conservation efforts by
"decoupling" revenues from sales levels and instead relying on a
revenue per customer approach to cost recovery. The utility had
earlier agreed to defer a scheduled base rate filing pending review
by the commission of its proposed merger with Washington Energy Co.
The commission said that it had approved the deferral subject to
the utility's agreement to file a rate case by April of 1996 if no
merger application was filed, but that any extension of the PRAM
collections beyond their scheduled expiration on October 1, 1996
would be treated a temporary rates subject to refund. It added that
the utility could choose to file a base rate case at any time
seeking permanent recovery of the PRAM collections. Washington

Light Co., Docket Nos. UE-901183-T et al., Nov. 7, 1995

LECs -- Competition -- Interconnection tariffs

The New York Public Service Commission has ordered New York
Telephone Co., a telecommunications local exchange carrier (LEC),
notify customers of the newly instituted opportunity to choose an
alternative carrier for intraLATA toll calling. Interexchange
carriers in the state had complained about the LEC's plans for
implementation of a recent order by the commission reqiring equal
access for intraLATA toll services. (Prior to the "intraLATA
presubscription" ruling, customers who desired their "local" toll
calls to be carried by an interexchange carrier such as AT&T, MCI,
or Sprint were required to dial special code numbers in addition to
the telephone number.)  The LEC had proposed that in negotiating
new services with customers its representatives would not inform
customers of the rule change or ask customers who they want as
their intraLATA toll carrier. It claimed that to do so would place
it at a competitive disadvantage and increase the cost of
processing new service orders. The commission disagreed with the
carrier finding that while the claims may have some merit, the LEC
had ignored the advantages it possessed in controlling the
telephone order processing function and from beginning the equal
access process with 100% of the presubscribed market. For a
competitive market to develop customers must be informed of
available choices, the commission said. It also noted that without
specific instructions from regulators "irresistible incentives"
would develop to sell the LEC's service unfairly. Re New York
Telephone Co., Case Nos. 28425 et al., Dec. 1, 1995 (N.Y.P.S.C.)

Trimble County Generating Plant -- Rate Disallowance

The Kentucky Public Service Commission has approved an agreement
finally concluding a long standing case governing rate treatment of
the investment by Louisville Gas & Electric in the Trimble county
generating facility. The matter had been before the commission in
one form or another for well over a decade.  In 1989 the commission
determined that 25% of the 495 megawatt coal-fired plant was
disallowed from rate base. Under the approved agreement the utility
will refund current customers $22 million with $5.3 million
reserved to special contract customers and the rest refunded to all
other customers through a per-kwh credit over a five year period.
The utility also agreed to apply an additional $4.5 million to fund
low-income energy assistance programs over the same five-year
period. Commissioner Linda K. Breathitt expressed concern in a
separate concurring opinion over the length of time necessary for
residential customers to receive their refunds while certain
industrial customers would receive immediate payments. She also
noted that the agreement was an example of a recent trends in
settlement agreements presented to the commission where the
utility, its large industrial customers, and low income customers
are the obvious beneficiaries of ardent representation at the
bargaining table while the vast majority of customers appear to
have a much smaller voice in the process. Re Louisville Gas and
Electric Co., Case No. 10320, Dec. 8, 1995 (Ky.P.S.C.).

BIG RIVERS AND PACIFICORP ARE EXPECTED TO SIGN THEIR DEAL BY END OF
JANUARY

By the end of January, Big Rivers Electric Corp. and PacifiCorp hope to
announce a ``letter of intent'' under which PacifiCorp would lease and
manage Big Rivers' coal-fired power plants in western Kentucky over the
next quarter century.
   ``We're working on it diligently right nowhopefully we'll see something
in the next two to three weeks,'' a PacifiCorp spokesman told Southeast
Power Report on Jan. 8. A spokeswoman for financially troubled Big Rivers,
based in Henderson, Ky., echoed that sentiment.
   Meanwhile, Big Rivers' two largest customers--Alcan Aluminum and
Southwire/NSA--were trying to insert themselves in the process to guarantee
that their desire for lower, more stable electric rates is addressed.
Together, aluminum smelters operated by Alcan and Southwire/NSA at Sebree
and Hawesville, Ky., respectively, consume nearly 70% of the electricity
generated by Big Rivers.
   The late December announcement that Big Rivers was negotiating with
PacifiCorp on a 25-year lease/operation agreement ended months of
speculation over which of several suitors would meet with Big Rivers'
approval.
   Even with the ongoing Big Rivers/PacifiCorp talks, however, several
suitors have not given up all hope. At least three--U.S. Generating, an
independent power producer, Cinergy Corp. and Louisville Gas &
Electric--reportedly believe they still have a chance if the PacifiCorp
discussions collapse.
   While neither Big Rivers nor PacifiCorp, an aggressive Portland,
Ore.-based investor-owned utility, apparently believes that will happen,
the Big Rivers spokeswoman stressed, ``We're not going to close any doors.
It wouldn't be wise considering the investment we've made in this process
so far.''
   Big Rivers has been trying to find a solution to its $1.2-billion debt,
much of which is owed to the Rural Utilities Service for construction of
the 440-MW D.B. Wilson coal-fired plant in the early 1980s. Some of the
offers submitted to Big Rivers were to buy the generation and transmission
cooperative and/or its generating assets.
   PacifiCorp's, however, was different. The Oregon utility would create a
subsidiary that would lease and operate Big Rivers' three plants: 480-MW
Green, 455-MW Coleman and Wilson, in addition to the 315-MW Station Two
plant that Big Rivers operates under a long-term contract with the owner,
the city of Henderson.
   The subsidiary would sell power to Big Rivers, which would resell it to
its four distribution cooperatives, Henderson-Union Electric Cooperative,
Jackson Purchase Rural Electric Cooperative, Meade County Rural Electric
Cooperative and Green River Electric.
   Perhaps as importantly, if not more so, the PacifiCorp subsidiary also
would handle Big Rivers' coal-buying activities and sell surplus
electricity from the power plants to other utilities in the eastern U.S.
   Big Rivers' past coal-buying practices have been the subject of state
and federal investigations. They have resulted so far in the conviction of
three individuals on bribery/kickback charges involving former Big Rivers
general manager William Thorpe. Thorpe, who has denied any wrongdoing, is
expected to stand trial next summer on related charges.
   Most observers believe PacifiCorp, the largest wholesaler of bulk power
in the western U.S., would be more successful than Big Rivers has been in
marketing surplus power.
   ``We have said we want to take our core skills in that area and use it
in markets outside the West,'' said the PacifiCorp spokesman. ``We want to
do that in Kentucky.''

ENRON POWER MARKETING, OGLETHORPE IN 4-MONTH SALES, PURCHASE DEAL

Oglethorpe Power Corp. announced Jan. 5 that it began a major four-month
energy sales-and-purchase deal with Enron Power Marketing Inc. Under the
arrangement, Enron will have the first option to buy energy from
Oglethorpe's 5,000-MW system, while covering energy requirements of
Oglethorpe's 39 member cooperatives through April 30 (SPR, 29 Dec. 95, 1).
   Oglethorpe customers can expect to save ``several millions of dollars''
as a result of the arrangement because Enron will meet their needs at a
price lower than the current Oglethorpe energy charge. Enron expects to
make a profit on sales of energy which some Oglethorpe members cannot use.
   The two sides have not released details of the deal. However, Oglethorpe
officials acknowledged that a major selling point of the arrangement was
Enron's first option to all energy available from Oglethorpe plant
entitlements and contracts. Oglethorpe estimates that Enron will buy more
than 5.2-million MWh of energy over the four months.
   Oglethorpe resources include 1,185 MW of must-run nuclear capacity and
1,500 MW of dispatchable baseload fossil capacity in Georgia at Wansley
Units 1 and 2 and Scherer Units 1 and 2. It also has 636 MW of dispatchable
pumped hydro capacity at the new Rocky Mountain plant and contracts for
baseload and peaking power with Georgia Power and a 300-MW independent
power project at Hartwell, owned jointly by American National Power and
Destec.
   Under the arrangement, Enron essentially will take over the marketing in
the region of Oglethorpe's excess, bearing the risks of a flat market as
well as the potential gains from a strong market. Its strategy proved
profitable in the early part of January when the Southeast was hit with
several days of subfreezing weather.
   Oglethorpe will continue to operate its system and control area and
carry out dispatching. But Enron will also be present in the Oglethorpe
control center and will have a say in decisions affecting energy based on
provisions in the contract.
   Oglethorpe officials said the Enron contract contains no provisions for
a follow-up deal after April 30.
    But the company sees the arrangement as one possible model for future
operations. A second alternative would be an energy pool operated by
Oglethorpe itself, which was proposed in late 1995 and is now in
preparation.
   Officials at Cooperative Power Inc., made up of six large Oglethorpe
members, said they are still on track to contract with a marketer
themselves to handle their power trading and procurement after April 30.
   Because of the Enron arrangement and other developments at Ogelthorpe,
including December's restructuring announcement, Georgia Power is delaying
a request for proposals for power purchases in 2000. The RFPs had been
scheduled to go out in early January.
   Georgia Power had told the state Public Service Commission in October
that it planned to seek bids for up to 600 MW of peaking and intermediate
supplies using both traditional and options contracts.
   But since the company currently has contracts to sell 750 MW of power to
Oglethorpe, which could be canceled over the next three years, it has
decided to review its future needs because of the Oglethorpe
restructuring.
   Oglethorpe itself is still holding in suspension a 1993 RFP for 600 MW
of 1999 peaking power while it works out its future plans and power needs
under the restructuring.

COLDEST WEATHER IN SIX YEARS CAUSES RECORD PEAKS THROUGHOUT FLORIDA

While snow blanketed much of the East Coast of the U.S., Florida felt the
coldest weather in more than six years, as high demand set new winter and
all-time peak records throughout the state.
   The state's three largest utilities all set new all-time record peaks,
as temperatures dropped nearly to 20F in much of the state on Jan. 9. The
primary source of heating in Florida is electric, which puts an additional
stress on the system. Still, state-wide reserve capacity was about 3,800 MW
on Jan. 9, according to Tom Hallam, staff engineer of the Florida Electric
Utility Coordinating Group.
   Tampa Electric, which is normally the chief supplier of purchase power,
hit a new all-time peak of 3,526 MW about 7:11 a.m. on Jan. 9. A spokesman
said TECO had no reserve capacity and had to crank up its rarely used
combustion turbine units in order to meet demand. TECO had expected a low
of about 31 degrees and a demand of about 3,400 MW, which would have
exceeded the previous all-time peak of 3,339 MW set on Feb. 9, 1995.
   Florida Power broke records on both Jan. 8, when it hit 8,086 MW, and
again on Jan. 9, when demand soared to about 8,500 MW, a spokesman said. To
meet demand, Florida Power exercised about 600 MW of residential load
control and cranked up all but one of its small combustion turbine units.
It did not resort to interrupting its large industrial and commercial
customers, which would have given it another 700 MW, a spokesman said.
   Florida Power & Light hit a new all-time demand record of about 17,300
MW on the morning of Jan. 9, which easily exceeded the previous record of
16,563 MW set on Feb. 9, 1995, a spokesman said. At the time, about 34,000
or 1% of its customers were out of service due to scattered distribution
problems. To meet demand, FP&L used about 300 MW of commercial load
control, but was not forced to use the 500 MW of residential load control
it had available.
   The Orlando Utilities Commission broke all-time peak records on both
Jan. 8, when demand reached 893 MW at about 7:30 am., and Jan. 9, when the
peak was 917 MW at about 7 a.m. OUC operates a power pool for itself, the
Florida Municipal Power Agency, the Lakeland Electric & Water Dept.,
Kissimmee Utility Authority and the city of St. Cloud. An OUC spokesman
said the pool set a record of 2,272 MW on Jan. 8, then broke that record on
Jan. 9 at 2,410 MW.
   In North Florida, the Jacksonville Electric Authority broke its previous
all-time peak of 2,247 MW, which was also set on Feb. 9, 1995, on Jan. 8,
when demand hit 2,339 MW. On Jan. 9, JEA came within 5 MW of breaking that
record, a spokesman said. Gulf Power set a new winter peak of 1,821 MW on
Jan. 8, beating its previous winter peak of 1,821 MW on Dec. 23, 1989.

REGIONAL STATE-BY-STATE SCORECARD OF ELECTRIC INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING

    Over the last three months, restructuring debates have heated up in
most parts of the country, with 30 states now reporting some sort of
activity. The California Public Utilities Commission came out with a major
compromise plan in late December, several New England states are asking
their utilities to file restructuring plans in the coming six months, and
regulators have issued initial restructuring guidelines in several
Midwestern states. Restructuring debates have even begun in a few Southern
states, even though lower power prices in the region kept activity at a
minimum. The following is a state-by-state survey of restructuring activity
in the Southeast. All dates are 1995 unless otherwise noted.

ARKANSAS
In early 1995, a bill was introduced in the state Legislature that would
allow large industrial users to switch retail suppliers under certain
conditions. But the bill was quickly withdrawn without a major debate.
State regulators say they expect to start a restructuring proceeding in
1996, but so far the Public Service Commission has issued no initial
notice.

FLORIDA
The state Legislature has created a special subcommittee to investigate
competition in the electric industry. The panel will gather information and
could make legislative proposals in 1996.

GEORGIA
The Public Service Commission said it will hold an investigation in 1996
on whether the state's current territorial franchise system needs to be
adapted to the more competitive electric industry environment. The current
system lets large users choose among supply options when adding new load
but gives no freedom of choice to smaller customers.
In December, a bill was introduced in the state Legislature that would
force utilities to provide retail wheeling services to all customers and
give customers wide rights to switch retail suppliers without penalty. The
bill contains no stranded investment provisions and is strongly opposed by
utilities.

LOUISIANA
A group of industrial users proposed in May that the city of New Orleans
consider an open-access approach, with several suppliers competing for
retail users using the existing New Orleans Public Service distribution
system. But the plan got a cold reception from the City Council, and
planned hearings on competition issues have been postponed indefinitely.

MARYLAND
The Public Service Commission is carrying out a proceeding on competition
(Case No. 8678). In comments filed in January, industrial users have
favored full retail competition, while utilities have backed some
deregulation of generation and limited retail competition tied to stranded
investment. The PSC final report issued Aug. 18 rejected the use of retail
wheeling, saying that the relatively low power rates in the state meant
Maryland did not need ``dramatic fixes'' at this time.

NORTH CAROLINA
In February, industrials asked the Utilities Commission to begin an
investigation into retail competition. After receiving generally negative
comments from utilities, the commission decided on July 21 not to implement
retail wheeling at this time (Doc. No. E-100, Sub. 77). It said wheeling
presented too many legal uncertainties and that it preferred to wait and
see what other states did. It asked parties to offer further comments on
the issue.
   In October, large industrials warned that the go-slow approach would put
the state at a competitive disadvantage and called on the commission to
sponsor a new round of public meetings on retail competition in early
1996.

OKLAHOMA
In June, the Legislature set up a 14-member task force to review all
aspects of the electric industry in the state. It is not clear how much the
group will deal with competition issues.

SOUTH CAROLINA
In July, the Public Service Commission turned down a request from
industrials to initiate a formal review of retail wheeling. Instead, the
PSC staff will carry out a low-key study of the issue.

TEXAS
A major bill passed by the Texas Legislature in late May ordered various
changes in the operation of the state's wholesale market. But due to a
political stand-off, the bill did not change the status quo on retail
wheeling issues. A proposal for a retail wheeling pilot was dropped from
the bill, as were various anti-retail wheeling provisions. Instead, the
Legislature asked state regulators to conduct studies on key issues. Since
then, industrials have begun to organize a wider coalition in support of
retail competition and hope to apply greater political pressure in the 1997
legislative session.
   The Texas Public Utility Commission in October opened a general
restructuring proceeding (Docket No. 15000) to make recommendations to the
Legislature by 1997 on competition and stranded investment issues. Parties
were asked to comment on specific unbundling and stranded cost concepts
floated by commission members.
   The PUC also is asking for comment by January 1996 on a separate
transmission rule. It would set up a regional postage stamp pricing system
for use of the state grid and also bring in an independent system operator
to manage the system.

VIRGINIA
In September, the Virginia State Corporation Commission announced it was
opening a formal review of electric industry competition and restructuring
issues. It said its staff would issue a report on March 31, 1996, making
policy recommendations. After a 60-day public comment period, the SCC will
make final decisions.
  In its notice, the commission said its staff had already held informal
talks with key parties and that even though Virginia already had low
electric prices, there could be improvement through increased competition.
In comments submitted to the SCC in December, Virginia Power urged a
go-slow approach to retail competition and said the commission should
concentrate first on alternative ratemaking for utilities.

AEP DROPS NAMES OF OPERATING UNITS; ALL CALLED AMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER

After decades of operation, Kentucky Power, Appalachian Power, Wheeling
Power and Kingsport Power are no more. In early January, the four utilities
adopted the name of their parent company, American Electric Power.
   The change--AEP's three other subsidiaries outside the Southeast were
affected as well--is part of AEP's ``New Directions Next Steps'' program to
prepare for competition and deregulation in the utility industry by trading
on its ``brand name'' recognition. AEP's other units are Columbus Southern
Power, Indiana Michigan Power and Ohio Power.
   All seven operating companies are now known as one company: American
Electric Power. From now on, the AEP logo will be emblazoned on company
facilities, vehicles and communications with customers. For the first time,
AEP's corporate headquarters in Columbus, Ohio, will bear a large ``AEP''
logo atop the building.
   Also this month, individual company publications are being consolidated
into one publication that will have a tabloid newspaper format.
   ``We've always been AEP, a world-class energy company dedicated to
hometown service, and our employees have worked under a variety of company
names in the past,'' said AEP chairman Linn Draper. ``Using AEP as our name
throughout the company is a sign that all of these individuals have joined
a single team to find ways to serve our customers even better.
   ``We do not need to change legal, financial, rate or regulatory
relationships as the result of the new one-company strategy,'' continued
Draper, ``but we expect our customers will see many benefits and
efficiencies from this change in days to come.''
   Not everyone within AEP was an enthusiastic supporter of the name change
last summer when Draper first disclosed plans to phase out operating
company identities. Over the years, fierce loyalties and friendly
competitions had developed within the seven subsidiaries.
   In the end, change won out as it is doing more frequently these days in
the utility industry.
   In keeping with its one-company philosophy, AEP has named new AEP
presidents as top statewide contacts for customer groups, legislators and
regulators. Effective Jan. 1, new state presidents include Timothy Moser,
Kentucky; Dana Waldo, West Virginia; and Daniel Carson, Virginia and
Tennessee.
   The state presidents will discuss what AEP believes are the benefits of
competition in the electric power industry with the company's customers,
regulators and legislators. They are expected to ``work diligently to build
a consensus on industry restructuring,'' Draper said.

VIRGINIA POWER TO CUT STAFF BY 30%; MAY PUT TWO 882-MW UNITS IN RESERVE

Virginia Power said Jan. 8 that its fossil and hydro business unit is in
the final stages of a far-reaching restructuring and downsizing effort
aimed at optimizing the cost-competitiveness of the utility's hydroelectric
facilities and plants fired by coal, oil and gas.
   Among other things, Virginia Power said, the fossil and hydro unit plans
to reduce by about 30% the number of salaried and hourly employees and to
``remission'' two large oil-fired plants from regular to emergency-only
use. These and other moves, it said, should save the utility $55 million to
$65 million a year and help maintain the utility's position as one of the
lowest-cost generators in its region.
   In a series of announcements over the past several months, the most
recent of which was Jan. 8, the fossil and hydro unit has said it will trim
its salaried and hourly payroll by a total of 537 positions by early March.
That will leave the unit with 1,254 employees.
   The utility said reductions are part of a ``comprehensive redesign
effort'' that grew out of the utility's Vision 2000 strategic planning
process.
   Last year, teams composed of fossil and hydro unit employees examined
potential efficiency and cost-cutting measures. In addition to recommending
the staffing reductions, the teams had urged that two 882-MW oil-fired
plants that have been providing intermediate and peaking capacity since the
mid-1970s--Possum Point Unit 5 and Yorktown Unit--should be placed in
emergency reserve, and be run four weeks each peak season.

SOUTH CAROLINA ALLOWS SCE&G TO SHIFT DEPRECIATION FROM T&D TO NUCLEAR
ASSETS

The South Carolina Public Service Commission has decided to allow South
Carolina Electric & Gas to transfer nearly $257 million in depreciation
reserves from its transmission and distribution assets to its nuclear
generation assets as part of a rate case (Docket No. 95-1000-E).
   The move has angered non-utility generators, industrials, and the
state's Dept. of Consumer Affairs, who claimed that the ruling will give
SCE&G--already one of the lowest-cost generators in the Southeast--an
unfair competitive advantage over other generators after deregulation, and
will increase the cost of accessing SCE&G's T&D system.
   The PSC also granted a 7.34%, $67.5-million rate hike for the utility.
   Nancy Vaughn Coombs, deputy consumer advocate at the state Dept. of
Consumer Affairs (DCA), explained that the depreciation-reserve shift will
result in a lower ``book value'' for SCE&G's two-thirds stake in the 900-MW
V.C. Summer nuclear plant, and a higher book value for the utility's T&D
assets.
   That, Coombs continued, will have the effect of shifting SCE&G's costs
away from its generation sector, which is likely to face increasing
competition as deregulation takes hold, to its T&D sector, which is likely
to remain a monopoly.
   In the increasingly competitive generation market, she said, other
generators and power marketers will be forced to compete with the
artificially lower generation costs SCE&G will be able to offer thanks to
the depreciation-reserve shift. Generators and marketers also will be
forced to pay artificially higher costs to wheel power across SCE&G lines
because those costs are based in part on the book value of its T&D assets.
   An irony in the matter, Coombs said, is that SCE&G already was unusually
well-positioned for generation competition even before it secured the PSC's
approval for the depreciation-reserve shift. ``Its rates are the lowest of
any investor-owned utility in South Carolina,'' she said, ``and are among
the lowest in the Southeast, which as a whole has the second-lowest rates
of any region in the country.''
   Coombs said the DCA will ask the PSC to reconsider its ruling, and added
that if the commission fails to do so, her agency is likely to file a legal
challenge in state court, asserting the depreciation reserve transfer
violates South Carolina law.
   The DCA's concerns were echoed by Craig Roach, a principal with Boston
Pacific Co. Inc. of Washington, D.C., who represents the Carolina
Competitive Energy Producers, a NUG group. ``The whole point of
unbundling,'' he said, ``is to reveal the true cost of generation,'' and
any effort to artificially lower the cost of generation is ``clearly
anti-competitive.''
   Roach added, however, that while he wishes the DCA well in its effort to
reverse the PSC's ruling, the group he represents cannot commit the
financial resources that would be involved in joining the fray. ``There are
too many battles to fight,'' he said.
   Also expressing concern about the depreciation-reserve shift was Arthur
Fusco, a Columbia, S.C., attorney who represents the South Carolina Energy
Users Committee (SCEUC), a 57-member industrial group that was been
pressing state regulators to accelerate deregulation and retail wheeling.
   Fusco said the depreciation reserve transfer would increase the wheeling
costs industrials would pay if, once retail competition arrives, they were
to buy their electricity requirements from a utility other than SCE&G.
   He said SCEUC also will urge the PSC to reconsider the magnitude of the
rate increase itself, which he said was ``way too high,'' in part because
the commission will allow SCE&G to earn a 12% rate of return on common
equity--a full percentage point higher than it had been earning.
   SCE&G general counsel Belton Ziegler defended the PSC's ruling, however,
and dismissed assertions that the transfer is anti-competitive. He said the
ruling will help his utility ``prepare for competition.''
   Among other things, Ziegler said the reserve shift is a necessary
preemptive step to ensure that any large retail customers that leave the
utility for other suppliers help pay for assets SCE&G had developed to
serve them. Without the shift, he said, residential and small-commercial
customers would likely end up paying for ``100%'' of the utility's stranded
investment, ``and we don't think that would be fair.''
   He continued, ``If you look at the natural gas industry, the benefits of
deregulation went for the most part to large customers who could move off
the system'' and avoid, as much as possible, the responsibility for paying
off the investments their old gas companies had made to serve them.
   ``We are telling industrials that if they leave as generation customers
they still will have to pay [for the nuclear assets SCE&G developed for
them] as transmission and distribution customers.''

`BLIZZARD OF '96', WHILE DUMPING MUCH SNOW, CAUSES RELATIVELY FEW OUTAGES

Given the magnitude of the snowstorm that swept through the northern tier
of the Southeast on Jan. 6 and 7, utilities in the region fared relatively
well, reporting customer outages that--taken together--ran only into the
tens of thousands.
   American Electric Power, which serves portions of Virginia and West
Virginia under what used to be called Appalachian Power Co. (see story on
its name changes this issue), said four of its smaller transmission lines
in the Virginias--one 138-kV line and three 69-kV lines--lost service
during the storm, but no customers were affected because power was
automatically rerouted through other lines.
   A total of about 15,000 customers elsewhere on the AEP system in
Virginia, West Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky lost power for a time
because of downed distribution lines, a spokesman said. Power was restored
to most within hours.
   Virginia Power, meanwhile, said as many as 30,000 customers lost power
during the storm, including 2,400 mostly commercial customers in downtown
Norfolk midday Sunday, Jan. 7, due to a conduit fault in an underground
11-kV circuit.
   A spokesman said the utility quickly replaced some 3,000 linear feet of
conduit so it could restore service to all but a few customers by early
Monday. The cause of the fault is still under investigation.
   The bulk of the outages on the Virginia Power system, however, were in
the Northern Neck and Gloucester area south of Washington, D.C., and on the
western shore of the Chesapeake Bay.
   Duke Power, in turn, said that as many as 34,000--or about 2%--of its
1.7 million North and South Carolina customers were without power at the
same time during the storm, mostly because of ice-related distribution-line
problems in and near Charlotte, N.C., and Greenville and Clemson, S.C.
   About 8,000 customers remained cut off Monday morning, a spokesman said,
but service was restored to most of them later that day.
   Carolina Power & Light, whose North and South Carolina service
territories experienced a mix of snow, sleet and rain, said it experienced
only one significant outage--affecting about 5,000 customers in the
Sanford, N.C., area, south of Raleigh.
   And Monongahela Power, whose West Virginia service territory was
blanketed with two feet of snow, said only a few dozen customers lost power
during the storm. A spokeswoman noted that while cold temperatures
increased residential demand over the weekend and on Monday, demand from
industrial and commercial customers was off sharply as businesses closed
because of the snow.

ENERGY INITIATIVES WINS FIRST ROUND ON FIRM CAPACITY PAYMENTS IN FLORIDA

Lake Cogen, a 112-MW project developed by Energy Initiatives, won a partial
summary judgment Jan. 4 in a case filed against Florida Power in state
circuit court in Lake County (No. 94354 CA-01, Division 8).
   The case revolves around whether firm capacity payments should be made
based on a model used by Florida Power, or a separate method the developers
of the gas-fired cogeneration facility said was specified in the contract.
Florida Power pays NUGs both capacity and energy payments when the
theoretically avoided generating unit would operate, but only as-available
or energy payments if the avoided unit would have been off-line.
   Florida Power claimed the theoretically avoided 500-MW pulverized coal
plant equipped with a scrubber, which was used to determine capacity and
energy payments, would be used by the utility based on four criteria to
determine when the plant would be dispatched on an economic basis. The four
parameters were the cost of variable operations and maintenance, the price
of coal, the heat rate of the unit, and a fuel multiplier of 1.
   In its motion, Lake Cogen contended other factors, such as environmental
compliance, should be used in determining economic dispatchability of a
generating unit. It said an actual, operating plant should be used for
comparison, namely Florida Power's coal-fired Crystal River units Nos.
1-2.
   Judge Don Briggs ruled the parameters for dispatchability should be
based on a real unit and not only the four Florida Power was using. He
ordered that a more accurate model be developed to determine how much Lake
Cogen should be paid. That cost information will be compared to actual
payments, which could be used to determine an award at a later date,
assuming the model shows Lake Cogen was underpaid. A schedule for further
proceedings had not be set.
   Fama confirmed that two other NUGs, Pasco Cogen and Orlando Cogen, have
similar court actions pending.
   Lake Cogen is located in Umatilla, Fla., and sells steam to Golden Gem
Growers. Partners in the project along with Energy Initiatives are Lake
Investment Holdings and NCP Lake Power Inc.

PANDA ENERGY, FLORIDA POWER CONTINUE FIGHT OVER PROJECT IN POLK COUNTY

Panda Energy and Florida Power have traded lawsuits in a dispute over
Panda's proposed project in Polk County.
   Panda was allowed to voluntarily withdraw without prejudice a
$345-million federal suit it had filed against Florida Power (SPR, 1l Aug
'95, 1), but Florida Power has since filed suit against Panda. In addition,
the state Public Service Commission denied two requests made by Panda in a
related action.
   The anti-trust suit Panda withdrew in U.S. District Court for the Middle
District of Florida, Tampa Division (Case No. 95-992-CIV-T-24 C), alleged
Florida Power unfairly interfered with its construction of a cogeneration
plant which was to have supplied Florida Power with 74.9 MW of firm power
under a standard offer contract.
   Panda's general counsel Bill Nordlund said the withdrawal was a
strategic move, ``and we still plan to prosecute this matter and move
forward on it.'' He would not specify when or in what venue.
   The countersuit filed by Florida Power at the end of December sought
declaratory judgments answering the allegations included in Panda's suit,
in case Panda refiled the case, according to Florida Power attorney Jim
Fama (95-2145-CIV-T-25-B).
   Florida Power asked the court to rule that:
Panda did not have a superior legal right to negotiate for a natural gas
transmission contract with the city of Lakeland, and that the utility did
not interfere with Panda's rights with the city;
  -- Panda is not entitled to a standard-offer contract if it builds a unit
larger than 75 MW;
  -- Panda is not entitled to payments under a standard-offer contract
beyond December 2016; and
  -- Panda has breached its contract by failing to begin construction on
the unit.
   The suit also sought relief from the court.
   On Jan. 3, the PSC refused to reconsider a decision the PSC made on Dec.
5, which said the PSC did have jurisdiction over standard-offer contracts
and the Florida Power/Panda dispute. It also refused to grant Panda a
90-day extension beyond Jan. 5 to file testimony in that case (Docket No.
950110-EI). As a result, a hearing at the PSC was scheduled for Feb. 19, a
staff recommendation was due April 18, and the commission was scheduled to
vote on April 30.

NCEMPA-1 TO USE NEW METERING EQUIPMENT TO EASE ENTRY INTO WHOLESALE MARKET

North Carolina Municipal Power Agency No. 1 said it is gearing up to enter
the Southeast wholesale power market over the next few months, and is
installing new wholesale delivery point metering equipment that will enable
it to predict with considerable accuracy how much surplus non-firm energy
it has to sell.
   NCMPA-1, part of Raleigh-based ElectriCities of North Carolina Inc.,
arranges wholesale power for 19 municipal utilities in the western part of
the state, including larger munis like those in High Point and Gastonia and
smaller ones like those in Lincolnton, Cherryville and Pineville.
   Through plant co-ownership and exchange agreements it signed with Duke
Power more than a decade ago, the agency is entitled to 850 MW from Duke's
2,200-MW Catawba nuclear power station in Clover, S.C. The investor-owned
utility agreed to buy back a significant portion of NCMPA-1's entitlement
initially, then decreasing amounts until the buy-back period ends around
the turn of the century.
   In part because Duke also agreed to buy back--at a relatively low
price--any surplus energy NCMPA-1 may have, and because of a
first-right-of-refusal clause that enabled Duke to match any offer another
potential buyer might make for that surplus, the agency made no real effort
in the 1980s and first half of the 1990s to market its surplus to others.
   Recently, however, NCMPA-1 and Duke reached an agreement that resolves
the first-right-of-refusal issue, and the agency decided to install special
metering equipment at key wholesale delivery points to its member munis to
provide it with real-time information about muni demand.
   That data also will enable NCMPA-1 to predict how much surplus energy it
will have available for sale, said Woody Adams, NCMPA-1's power-supply
manager.
   Adams told Southeast Power Report that while his agency always has had
the right to sell surplus energy, ``we didn't havethe ability to know on a
timely basis how much surplus energy we had'' available for sale.
   He predicted that in 1996 NCMPA-1 will have at least 500 GWh and
possibly as much as 600 GWh of surplus energy for sale either through the
Automated Interchange Matching System (AIMS) or through bilateral deals,
and that that amount would grow to at least 1,000 GWh by 2000.
   ``The surplus will be available primarily in the off-peak hours,'' Adams
said, with more--including, perhaps, some peak-hour energy--available in
non-summer months, but at least some available at night and on weekends all
12 months of the year. He said summer-peaking NCMPA-1 sees particular
promise in ``seasonal diversity'' deals with winter-peaking entities to its
north and west, as well as daily or even seasonal ``energy swaps.''
   The cost of producing the energy in question, he noted, is
``characteristic of typical generation costs for a well-run nuclear unit,''
but he declined to provide specifics. Duke is generally considered to be
one of the nation's premier operators of nuclear facilities.
   ``What we intend to do initially,'' Adams said, ``is to market the
surplus energy on AIMS'' beginning later this winter, ``as well as to enter
into exchange agreements with power marketers and with utilities that are
either directly connected to Duke or that have ready access'' to the
investor-owned utility.
   Duke would have ``as much right as anyone'' to buy power through AIMS,
he said, adding that NCMPA-1 already has signed exchange agreements with
several marketers, including Citizens Lehman Power, Enron Power Marketing,
and LG&E Power Marketing.
   The major advantages of participating in the market, Adams said, ``will
be to give us the contacts and experience we'll need to be active in those
markets as they evolve.''
   The impact of surplus energy sales on NCMPA-1's balance sheet, ``while
significant, will not be a make-or-break thing for us. We see it more as an
initial step toward becoming competitive in deregulated power markets,'' he
said.
   Meanwhile, NCMPA-1 also is installing equipment to monitor the loads of
``well over 50'' of its munis' largest retail customers. That equipment,
said Mark Otersen, the agency's supervisor of demand-side operations, will
let NCMPA-1 gather information on customer demand and chart customer load
``shapes''--or patterns of demand.
   That load-shape data, in turn, should help NCMPA-1 design new
demand-side management-related rates for industries with common load
shapes, and help its member munis convince large energy users of the
benefits of using such rates, Otersen said.
   He noted that relatively few of the large retail customers served by
munis in western North Carolina currently participate in load-management
programs that provide incentives to those who agree to let their utility
curtail or interrupt power during peak periods, or who agree to run
peak-shaving standby generators.

LG&E POWER MARKETING SEEKS TO BROKER POWER SALES AND PURCHASES BY TVA

LG&E Power Marketing Inc. (LPM) has asked the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission to approve changes in its accounting practices to cover a
contract under which the marketer will broker power sales and purchases by
the Tennessee Valley Authority and assign all gains and losses to its
affiliate Louisville Gas & Electric.
   In a Dec. 15 filing to FERC, LPM said that it was about to enter into an
interchange agreement with TVA under which it would sell energy to TVA and
buy energy for resale to third parties (Doc. No. ER94-1188-000).
   While it will take title to energy received from TVA, it will pass all
benefits from the transactions on to LG&E, thereby maintaining its broker
status in the deals.
   LPM officials said they already perform this non-exclusive brokering
function for LG&E with other energy sellers based on existing general
arrangements with LG&E on file at FERC.
   In the TVA case, however, the two parties will change a system under
which the marketer pays a fee to LG&E for dispatching and transmission
services. Instead of a straight fee, LPM will use the dispatching fee as a
``true up'' mechanism to insure that LG&E receives the full benefit of any
deal involving TVA energy.
   It asked FERC to approve this new arrangement now so that questions
about accounting procedures will not arise later which might hinder LPM's
marketer status and ability to use market-based pricing under FERC
regulations.
   In its filing, LPM also asserted that it was entitled to enter an
interchange agreement with TVA despite a Congressional ban on TVA sales
outside its own territory, because its affiliated franchise, LG&E, was
grandfathered under the 1957 TVA ``fence'' law.
   It also noted that its arrangement with LG&E was not exclusive since any
of its competitors with similar rights could carry out the same services
for LG&E. It said the deal did not in any way increase its market power or
result in undue discrimination or preference and would not be detrimental
to LG&E ratepayers.
   FERC asked for comment by Jan. 12. It appears likely that some utilities
in the region may raise questions about the ``fence issue.''
   Already, in September, when the issue of an interchange between LPM and
TVA first arose, members of Congress asked for an explanation of its legal
aspects. At that time, TVA sent a letter to Sen. Lauch Faircloth (R-NC)
assuring him that the arrangement could be done under current fence rules
(SPR, 22 Sept '95, 1).
   At the same time, industry sources said it is possible TVA will attempt
to attach a last-minute amendment to the current budget bill to create a
more explicit permission to allow such interchanges with affiliates of the
14 grandfathered utilities.
   Last summer, TVA publicly pulled back from a plan to introduce
legislation to bring down the fence, and it remains to be seen if it now
will take a piecemeal approach, starting with energy sales to marketers and
energy pools which have immediate applications in the region.

WTU TO SUPPLY CO-OP WITH 11.7 MW, INCLUDING NEW COTTON SPINNING PLANT

Central and South West unit West Texas Utilities has signed a 10-year deal
to supply a total of 11.7-MW to Midwest Electric Cooperative of Roby,
Texas.
   The pact takes effect in two stages. On Sept. 1, 1997, WTU will begin
supplying 5 MW to Midwest to serve the Lortex Industries cotton spinning
plant in Snyder, Texas. The plant represents new load and the entry of a
new industry to that part of Texas.
   On June 1, 1998, it will begin supplying another 6.7 MW. That capacity
has been supplied by TU Electric.
   The contract also has an extended terms provision, meaning that WTU also
will supply any load growth that Midwest experiences at the Lortex
facility.
   WTU said the pact would have a non-fuel revenue impact of $1.4 million
annually when fully implemented. To supply Midwest, WTU will build 39 miles
of 69-kV line and two substations.
   Midwest serves 5,640 members in 10 Texas counties.

LG&E AND LG&E MARKETER MAKE DEAL
WITH OHIO ED SWAPPING COAL FOR POWER

An unusual agreement is in the works among Louisville Gas & Electric, LG&E
Power Marketing and Ohio Edison under which LG&E would supply high-sulfur
coal to Ohio Ed and LPM would receive 300 MW of electricity for one year
from Ohio Ed's Burger power plant.
   An Ohio Ed spokesman confirmed that negotiations are under way but said
a final agreement has not been reached. An LPM spokeswoman said she could
not comment on the proposed arrangement until it is finalized.
   A source familiar with the pending deal said the talks are being
governed by ``very strict confidentiality agreements.'' Apparently, here is
how the transaction would work: LG&E would supply up to 1 million tons of
high-sulfur coal, reportedly from West Virginia, this year to the Burger
plant, located at Shadyside, Ohio.
   In return, LPM would have access to 300 MW of electricity from Burger to
supply its own customers.
   Another Ohio Ed spokesman said he could not comment on the proposed bulk
power agreement because of the ``increasingly competitive'' bulk power
market and electric utility industry.
   The source told The McGraw-Hill Companies' Power Markets Week that such
arrangements may become more commonplace as competition and deregulation
come to the utility industry. ``With a dramatically changing industry such
as the power production industry, you're going to see unusual agreements
more and more,'' she said.
   LPM has been very aggressive since its formation last August. It and
LG&E are subsidiaries of LG&E Energy Corp.

NYMEX LOOKS TO TVA, SOUTHERN COMPANY
AS POSSIBLE FUTURES CONTRACT SITES

With its two proposed electricity futures contracts on track to be
effective this spring, the New York Mercantile Exchange is considering
delivery points in the East to launch further contracts. Among the systems
under consideration in the Southeast are the Tennessee Valley Authority and
the Southern Company system.
   Patrick Thompson, president of the New York Mercantile Exchange, last
week predicted the Commodity Futures Trading Commission will act on the
exchange's two proposed electricity futures contracts before the end of the
month, which could allow trading to begin by the end of March or early in
the second quarter of this year.
   NYMEX filed supplemental information on its proposed futures contracts
with the CFTC late last month. The material, responding to commission
inquiries concerning the deliverability of the commodity and potential
regulation of electricity futures by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, was filed under a claim of confidentiality and was not made
publicly available.
   The confidential filing cleared the way for CFTC staff to begin
preparing a memorandum for consideration by the commission. The four
sitting commissioners likely will begin considering whether to approve the
contracts later this month, according to a CFTC source.
   Assuming the supplemental filing from NYMEX answers all the questions
raised by the CFTC staff, the memorandum now being drafted could be sent to
the commission within two weeks, the CFTC source said.
   ``I'm really confident now that the CFTC has had all of its questions
answered--both technical and regulatory,'' NYMEX's Thompson said in a
telephone interview last week. ``I expect the approval process to conclude
very quickly.''
   NYMEX is expected to launch both contracts at the same time. The two
contracts are virtually identical, except for the physical delivery points
at the Palo Verde nuclear station switchyard and the California/Oregon
border intertie. The exchange plans to let the markets decide whether one
or both futures contracts will be sustained in the long term.
   NYMEX's advisory group is also considering the Pennsylvania-New
Jersey-Maryland Interconnection and American Electric Power's grid as
potential delivery points for further futures contracts in the East.

GREENVILLE, N.C., MUNI USES COINCIDENT
PEAK RATES TO CUT INDUSTRIAL COSTS

Officials of the Greenville Utilities Commission in North Carolina said
that coincident-peak-based rates have not only allowed the muni's existing
industrial customers to cut electric bills, but are helping the muni to
lure new business to the city.
   John Chaffee, executive director of the Pitt County Development
Commission, said industrials that are taking full advantage of the CP rates
pay no more--and sometimes less--than they would for power from neighboring
investor-owned utilities and electric cooperatives that serve areas around
Greenville.
   GUC buys all its wholesale power from the North Carolina Eastern
Municipal Power Agency, which in turn buys most of its power from Carolina
Power & Light.
   Because a significant portion of NCEMPA's and the muni's wholesale power
costs is based on their demand during CP&L's highest systemwide demand hour
each month, the muni agency and Greenville have been working hard to
minimize their monthly peaks through, among other things, aggressive
residential load control programs, and programs to help industrials install
peak-shaving generation.
   GUC general manager Roger Jones said the Greenville muni also in
mid-1994 replaced its traditional industrial rate schedule with a new menu
of CP-only rates that all customers with a demand of 750 kW or more must
choose from.
   The GUC typically notifies its industrial customers by automated signal
when it expects a potential coincident-peak period to be approaching; at
that point, the rate agreement says, the customer ``may utilize any means
deemed suitable to reduce its coincident peak demand,'' including, for
instance, temporary production cuts and/or the use of muni-approved
peak-shaving generators.
   Jones said that the muni's 750-kW-plus customers, who also include some
large commercial and institutional accounts, together comprise about
one-quarter of Greenville's total energy use. The CP rates have encouraged
them to reduce their peak-period demand by 15 to 20% from what it typically
would have been without the coincident-peak rates.
   The magnitude of reductions in coincident-peak demand varies widely from
customer to customer, the muni manager said. Some are able only to trim
their demand slightly, while others have been ``very aggressive'' and have
slashed peak-period demand by more than 50%.
   For example, a large Proctor & Gamble manufacturing plant in Greenville
that typically demands about 8 MW reduces its demand to between 1 and 1.5
MW during coincident peaks, Jones noted, saving both P&G and the muni
thousands of dollars in monthly power costs.
   Chaffee said P&G ``basically shuts down production [during forecasted CP
hours] to achieve the maximum possible savings.'' To make the best use of
its down time, he noted, the manufacturer performs required maintenance on
its production and other equipment.
   Chaffee gave as an example the new automobile parts plant that Japan's
ASMO Co. Ltd. in 1994 developed--and in 1995 expanded--in Greenville. The
combined $50-million facility demands about 2.5 MW.
   ``An important issue for ASMO in deciding where to site the [initial]
plant was power costs,'' he said. ``We were able to demonstrate that by
utilizing Greenville's CP rate and installing [a 1-MW peak-shaving
generator to further reduce CP demand] that they would be paying rates
competitive with'' industrial rates offered by Duke Power and other
low-cost, investor-owned utilities in the Southeast.
   Chaffee added, finally, that in his view the CP has been a significant
factor in enabling Greenville to draw increasing numbers of new industries.
He noted that while industrial firms announced $20 million in new
investments in the city in 1992 and $33 million the year after that,
industrial investment jumped to $43 million in 1994 and $55 million in
1995--the first two years the CP rates were mandated.

TECO ROE CAPPED AT 12.5% IN AGREEMENT
TIED TO 260-MW COAL GASIFICATION PLANT

The Florida Public Service Commission voted Jan. 3 to cap the 1996 rate of
return on equity for Tampa Electric at 12.5% and to determine at a future
time how over-earnings might be distributed (Docket No. 950379-EI).
   The action, coming after TECO earned about $45 million more than its
allowed ROE in 1995, will forestall a rate case that would have been filed
in 1996 to pay for a new generating unit.
   In an earlier stipulation with staff, TECO's 1995 earnings were capped
at 12.75% and about $45 million of over-earnings will be deferred until
1997, after TECO's new $550-million, 260-MW integrated coal gasification
combined cycle plant which is in Polk County goes on-line in late 1996
(SPR, 19 May '95, 16). TECO's actual ROE for 1995 was expected to be about
16%.
   The deal between staff and TECO effectively replaced negotiations the
utility was conducting with the Office of the Public Counsel, which
represents ratepayers at the Florida Public Service Commission, according
to OPC attorney Roger Howe (SPR, 31 Dec '95, 11).
   The PSC's action, which was the result of last-minute negotiations
between staff and TECO on 1996 earnings, could mean that any excess
revenues could be used for the plant, a refund, to offset regulatory
assets, or for depreciation in 1997 or later. The PSC will likely make a
decision on disposition of 1996 excesses sometime in early 1997, according
to Tim Devlin of the PSC's Auditing and Finance Division.
   Under the arrangement for 1996, TECO will have an ROE range of 11.5% to
13.5%. However, all of the earnings over 11.5% will be split, which
effectively caps earnings at 12.5%. TECO estimated it will earn about
13.27% in 1996.
   The Polk unit will go into rate base in late 1996 and based on TECO's
earnings projections, which are considered conservative, it will still earn
in excess of its allowed ROE. The 1995 excess carried forward was also
expected to cover the additional cost of the new unit through 1997 and,
possibly, beyond.
   Howe said that, because interest rates were expected to further decline
during the next few years, it was likely the PSC would reduce TECO's
allowed ROE for 1997, which could mean additional excess earnings in that
year, despite the new unit.

NEW GEORGIA POWER RESIDENTIAL DSM
PROGRAM SHIFTS CONTROL TO CUSTOMERS

Georgia Power has proposed to state regulators a new residential load
control program which it says will create 156 MW of savings over 10 years.
   Under the plan, customers would buy the control equipment from Georgia
Power at discounted prices. While this approach is expected to limit
participation to about 10% of all homes, it will only cost the utility a
$20.1-million investment during the 10-year period, meeting the new state
policy limiting DSM spending.
   Under the proposal, submitted to the Georgia Public Service Commission
in December, Georgia Power will give its residential users a choice of
three approaches to carry out load control.
   The most sophisticated will be a home control system based on Scientific
Atlanta's ``SuperStat'' thermostat, which will adjust home power use in
response to a ``critical price signal'' from the utility.
   The second approach would use the SuperStat equipment to cycle air
conditioners and other appliances at different times of day based on
prearranged peak and off-peak demand periods. And the third approach will
be to simply offer time-of-use rates to customers with conventional
thermostat control equipment and encourage them to take advantage of price
differentials by voluntarily setting controls.
   Georgia Power said it expects 11,000 customers to actively participate
in this third approach over ten years with a potential savings of 33 MW.
The three programs together would involve about 81,000 homes after 10
years, representing about an 11.2% penetration of the Georgia Power
customer base.

FLA. COMMISSION APPROVES DSM GOALS
AND PLAN FOR LAKELAND ELECTRIC & WATER

The Florida Public Service Commission approved on Dec. 19 conservation
goals and plans for the Lakeland Electric & Water Dept., after the
municipal utility reached agreement with the state's Dept. of Community
Affairs.
   The conservation plan says that by the end of 2005 Lakeland must
guarantee 26.9 MW in winter and 33.5 MW in summer of savings from
residential customers (Docket Nos. 930556-EG and 950445-EG). That same
year, Lakeland plans to guarantee 3.2 MW in winter and 11.6 MW in summer of
savings from commercial/industrial customers.
   The PSC, however, rejected the muni's request to use demand and energy
savings from one customer class to make up shortfalls in another customer
class. The PSC said a ruling on that issue was premature and that Lakeland
should not ask unless the situation occurred.
   Plans for nine other of the state's largest muni's and cooperatives were
approved by the PSC in late November, while plans for the state's four
largest investor-owned utilities received commission approval in May (SPR,
1 Dec., 11; 2 May, 11). Only two utilities required to submit plans remain:
Tallahassee Electric Dept. (Docket No. 930559-EG) and Florida Public
Utilities (Docket No. 930552-EG), which is a small investor-owned utility.

DTI RAISES POSSIBILITY OF SHIPPERS' LEVY FOR TAKE-OR-PAY COSTS

The take or pay liabilities faced by British Gas continue to tax minds
and stir emotions in the industry.  While BG has taken on a chief
negotiator to "lead and direct the renegotiation of gas purchase
contracts", the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has dropped a
potential timebomb in the shape of a possible levy on shippers to cover
the extra cost of high-priced take-or-pay gas.  In addition, delays in
the drafting of licences for shippers and public gas transporters and
the associated transfer documents and special licence conditions have
meant the Appointed Day has slipped from 1 February to 1 March.  This
has raised concerns over a potential delay to the domestic competition
pilot scheme, due to start in the south-west on 1 April.

At a high-level panel meeting between shippers, BG TransCo and Ofgas
last Saturday (6 January), DTI head of oil and gas John Michell
outlined verbally a new Condition 12 for the shippers' licence,
currently being redrafted for release "very soon".  This would allow
the Secretary of State to impose a levy on shippers, via the
transportation charge, to financially benefit suppliers with long-term
take-or-pay obligations.  The size of this levy is not certain,
although 1p or 2p a therm has been mooted.  It is uncertain also quite
how this levy would be passed from TransCo to the appropriate supplier
and whether the recipient will be just British Gas Supply.

While everyone in the industry is waiting to see a written version of
the proposal before giving a considered response, this "Top Gas" type
scheme, similar to that used in Canada, raised initial alarm with both
shippers, who questioned why they should pay for BG's problems, and
with the Gas Consumers Council which feared customers would pick up the
tab.  The last minute nature of the addition of condition 12 means
there will be little time to consider its full implications.  BG said
it remained keen to reach agreement with producers over renegotiated
contracts, but it considered the levy proposal to be a useful
contingency plan.

British Gas has indicated that the first producers to agree to
renegotiate contracts with BG will get best terms.  So far North Sea
producers have shown no inclination to revamp long term take-or-pay
contracts to supply BG at prices well above current competitive market
levels.  The job of BG's new chief negotiator Kenneth Gardener, a
director of Charterhouse Bank, is to persuade producers to come to the
table.  Gardener, who took on his new post on 1 January, has given up
executive duties at Charterhouse but remains a director.

On his appointment last month he acknowledged producers would be
reluctant to re-open legally binding contracts but said he believed a
"win win" position could emerge from negotiations.  He has agreed to
give at least two years to the problem.  BG also underlined the
increased significance of legal issues in its affairs with the
appointment of William Friedrich, formerly with international law firm
Shearman & Sterling, as its general counsel.

Levy proposal

The DTI is maintaining that its levy proposal is still under
consideration and would be included in the licence on a contingency
basis only.  No decision has been made as to whether the condition
would be invoked.  The government may be using it as a threat to
producers to encourage them to sit down with BG to renegotiate
contracts.  However, this could backfire if producers feel they risk
being hit with a "double whammy" whereby they accept a lower price for
gas from BG and are then hit by a levy because other producers have
been unwilling to renegotiate.  Thus the messages coming from the DTI
appear somewhat confusing.

The Gas Consumers Council is concerned that a levy will keep prices for
domestic customers higher than a free market would otherwise deliver.
Council director Ian Powe said: "Contingency provision for a levy on
all shippers would, if implemented, be passed on to consumers in prices
higher than they would otherwise pay.  It must not be seen as anything
more than an insurance policy against British Gas' failure to sort out
its own problems.  Customers can accept no blame for this predicament.
We would need to have very different information than we have now in
order to concede that any of British Gas' contractual liabilities
should be passed on to its own and other suppliers' customers".  The
Council has asked for full disclosure of all facts before any levy is
imposed and on 12 December proposed that the House of Commons Trade and
Industry Committee should conduct an enquiry into public interest
issues arising from BG's take-or-pay commitments.

BG is now working on the transferal of its supply contracts (and the
related take-or-pay obligations) to a new subsidiary.  Under the new
Gas Act the same company is not allowed to act as a public gas
transporter and gas supplier.  This restructuring will take place on
the Appointed Day.  During debate of the Gas Bill, producers expressed
concern that BG would be able to offload its take-or-pay liabilities
into a number of subsidiaries without proper guarantees.  Amendments to
the Act mean there will be a single trading subsidiary, but some
questions still remain over the fact that this subsidiary will have no
parent guarantee.  How will the DTI ensure the long-term funding and
solvency of the subsidiary to make sure it is not allowed to fall into
bankruptcy to avoid take-or-pay commitments?

Appointed Day

Another important issue discussed at the panel meeting was the timing
of the Appointed Day for licences and introduction of the Network Code.
 DTI confirmed that while a final draft of the suppliers' licence had
been issued, the shippers' licence still needed completion of the
controversial condition 12.  Michell said the public gas transporters'
licence, the transfer scheme and special licence conditions had slipped
badly in the drafting timetable, due to the time required to turn
policy into legal drafting, as opposed to policy difficulties.
Slaughter and May was working on the special conditions, but he was not
entirely confident that all the licence documentation would be in place
by 1 February, the proposed Appointed Day.  Accordingly it was agreed
that the Appointed Day should be moved to 1 March, with a panel meeting
on 2 February to confirm this date.  Energy balancing will be
introduced from 1 September.

The big question is how this delay will affect the proposed 1 April
date for the introduction of the domestic competition pilot scheme.
While it is the job of the Domestic Competition Steering Group, chaired
by Clare Spottiswoode, to discuss this issue, it was agreed at the
panel meeting that TransCo should continue with its current timetable
for systems implementation and testing.  SPA is already under trial,
and nomination and confirmation of all sites by shippers will utilise
the SPA system from 1 February.  The Gti system would not be used for a
start date of supply beyond 1 February, but would be retained for
invoicing purposes.  While some shippers were still concerned over the
accuracy of their sites and meters portfolios, most felt they were
workable and were not a reason for delay, as long as a suitable
reconciliation process for disputes was established.  Dual billing of
sites was being tackled among the shippers themselves, but some sites
remained without any nomination.

The running and testing of SPA is seen by many shippers as one of the
most important systems steps for the domestic trial, and suppliers such
as Amerada Hess and Total, who are committed to participating in the
first trial, remain optimistic that the 1 April date can be maintained.
 However, TransCo itself has been giving conflicting messages over its
attitude to the timing of the pilot.  Having originally requested six
months between the implementation of the Network Code and the domestic
competition pilot, in order to test systems thoroughly, TransCo had
reluctantly agreed to first a four-month and then a two-month gap.  The
shift from 1 February to 1 March for Network Code implementation means
the gap will narrow to one month, although systems testing will be
underway before the official start date.

Systems failure

While some in TransCo appear to have indicated a willingness to
consider this option, managing director Harry Moulson came out very
strongly in favour of delaying the pilot in a Times interview this
week.  He suggested the introduction of domestic competition should be
delayed until June because the computer system is untried and could
fail.  He said it would be "ludicrous" to press ahead with the trial in
April, as there were significant risks, including the worst outcome
where a breakdown left TransCo unable to maintain pipeline pressure.  A
more likely risk, he suggested, would be an inability for TransCo to
confirm meter readings if too many customers wished to switch supplier.
 He also admitted that TransCo's service to its customers had been
"bloody awful" last year, and although it was improving he felt there
was a way to go.

Ofgas has indicated there should be "a searching review to determine
why the 1 April date cannot be retained for the introduction of the
domestic market".  Chris Rees from Touche Ross has been taken on as a
"troubleshooter" reporting to Ofgas, to examine whether the 1 April
deadline is feasible or whether the start-up date should be delayed by
a month or two.  He is currently visiting interested parties and is
expected to make his recommendation in late February.  It is likely the
introduction will be on a quota or rationed basis, with say a maximum
of 1,000 confirmations per day in the early days to minimise system
strain.

BG RANKED SIXTH IN SURVEY OF OVERALL GAS COMPANY PROFITABILITY

British Gas ranks sixth in terms of overall composite profitability in
comparison with 159 gas companies surveyed worldwide in 1994, according
to a survey* compiled by the Sheffield Energy & Resources Information
Services (SERIS).  Based on 1992-1994 information, the survey uses
operating and financial data to rank the upstream and downstream
activities of gas companies in 48 countries, according to 25
competition and performance indicators.  The information is also used
to compile a profitability index, headed in 1994 by Statoil as the top
performing company, against which the remaining companies are measured
(see table).  In the index the company's absolute profit, profit margin
and rate of return on assets are combined and given equal weight.
However, SERIS points out that the accuracy of the information is
dependent on the operations of each company and on its willingness to
disclose such data.

In compiling the survey, SERIS considered each company's upstream
operations and downstream gas pipeline and marketing segments, and used
the information to rank the following companies:

* top five gas production companies in 1994: Russia's Gazprom with
20,150.7 billion cubic feet (Bcf), Algeria's Sonatrach (4,569.8 Bcf),
Indonesia's Pertamina (2,661.0 Bcf), the UK's Royal Dutch/Shell Group
(2,574.0 Bcf) and Saudi Arabia's Saudi Aramco (2,479.1 Bcf);

* top five companies for gas pipeline sales in 1994: Dutch company
Nederlandse Gasunie with 2,899.4 Bcf, Germany's Ruhrgas (2,006.1 Bcf),
Italy's ENI subsidiary SNAM (1,707.9 Bcf), France's Gaz de France
(1,329.5 Bcf) and the US's Tenneco (870.5 Bcf).  British Gas, in second
place in SERIS's 1993 ranking, declined to disclose a figure for gas
sales because of "the commercial sensitivity of the data in the run up
to competition in the gas market".  Similarly, British Gas's market
rivals were equally unwilling to disclose figures to SERIS;

* top five companies for total gas pipeline throughput volume in 1994
(gas pipeline sales plus gas transported for third parties): Canada's
Nova Corp with 4,089.0 Bcf, the US's Tenneco (3,328.0 Bcf), Nederlandse
Gasunie (3,164.2 Bcf), Slovakia's Slovak Gas Industry (SPP) (2,765.0
Bcf) and the US's Panhandle Eastern Corporation (2,498.0 Bcf).  British
Gas's figures for throughput volume (2,197 Bcf) put the company into
eighth place in 1994 compared with fifth place in 1993;

* top five companies for gas marketing sales in 1994 (sales of bought-
in third party gas by marketing subsidiaries): US company Enron Corp
with 2,489.6 Bcf, the US's Natural Gas Clearinghouse (1,286.0 Bcf),
Canada's Transcanada Pipelines Ltd (1,171.3 Bcf), the US's Panhandle
Eastern Corp (1,134.6 Bcf) and the US's Coastal Corp (989.0 Bcf);

* top five most profitable gas companies in absolute terms in 1994:
Italy's SNAM, with an operating profit of US$1,920m, British Gas with
$1,356m, Gaz de France with $872.8m, Transcanada Pipelines with $733.9m
and Norway's Statoil with $603.4m.

SOME GAS PRICES LINKED TO PRICE OF ELECTRICITY

It appears some companies supplying gas to power plants have been
offering contracts where the gas price is linked to the price of
electricity in the pool, thus protecting generators from a price
squeeze following changes in the electricity price.

This is seen as a marketing tool to secure sales in a market under
pressure from falling gas prices and surplus supplies.  It carries
risks of large losses for the gas supplier and such deals may be
offered at a premium.

Scottish Hydro is one generator that is believed to have agreed a gas
contract with around 40% linked to the electricity pool price.

Gas prices are more usually linked to an indicator such as the retail
price index.

UK ENERGY PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION

Provisional statistics showing energy production and consumption in the
three months September to November 1995, published by the Department of
Trade and Industry, show that production of indigenous primary fuels,
at 67.9 million tonnes of oil equivalent (mtoe) was 5.4% higher than in
the corresponding period a year ago.

Production of coal, natural gas, primary electricity and petroleum rose
by 12.0%, 7.8%, 4.3% and 3.2% respectively.  Deep-mined coal was 21.0%
higher than in the same period a year ago as the newly privatised
companies increased production.

Total inland consumption of primary fuels, which includes deliveries
into consumption, during the three months September to November 1995,
at 52.9 mtoe was 0.6% less than in the same period a year ago.

Consumption of natural gas increased by 9.0% largely due to low
consumption in November 1994 because of exceptionally mild weather, and
a significant increase in use for electricity generation in September
to November 1995, compared with the same period a year earlier.

Consumption of petroleum and coal fell by 3.7% and 9.7% respectively.

BRITISH GAS TO DRILL OFF THE LANCASHIRE COAST

British Gas Exploration and Production (E&P) is to drill an exploration
well some 11 kilometres southwest of Formby Point on the Lancashire
Coast.  This will be the fifth well it has drilled in exploration block
110/14.

A jack-up drilling rig, the Global Adriatic XI, will be towed to
location and will drill to a depth of approximately 1,350 metres
beneath the seabed.  Drilling will last about two weeks.

The target reservoir is the same as the Morecambe fields, already
developed by British Gas.  An extensive survey of the area was
undertaken before the decision was made to drill, said BGE&P.

British Gas is the main acreage holder in the Irish Sea, currently
operating 19 blocks in the East Irish Sea, North Channel and Caernarvon
Bay, and participating in four others in the East Irish Sea.

OFGAS SEMINAR ON PREPAYMENT METERS

Ofgas held another seminar last month at the Church House Conference
Centre, this time to discuss and seek views on the thorny issue of
access by future domestic gas suppliers to prepayment meters.

Suppliers need access to prepayment technology to be able to meet their
licence obligations. The current Quantum System is viewed as the only
realistic technology for the competitive market, however it is a system
firmly stamped with the BG logo.

The aim of the seminar was to discuss and get agreement on what has
been called a short term solution to allow prepayment  supply from the
start of a competitive gas market, but which is not necessarily the
long term solution.

The main thrust appears to suggest suppliers will need to agree among
themselves a series of prices for gas supplied through a prepayment
meter.

Data constraints in the Quantum System, which was originally designed
for an integrated supplier, mean that it would be difficult and costly
for each supplier to have its own individual price.

BG TRANSCO PROPOSES HIGHER RANGE FOR COST OF CAPITAL ESTIMATES

BG TransCo has published a paper on its cost of capital, the first in a
series that will consider specific elements of the current price
control formula review.  The paper has been made public to stimulate
debate and add transparency to the process, said TransCo.  It concludes
that the range for TransCo's cost of capital, or allowed rate of
return, is now 7.4%-8.9%, with the actual cost towards the upper end of
this range.  This compares with the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
1993 enquiry which estimated the range for TransCo's cost of capital
was 6.5%-7.5% pre-tax.

In a letter to Ofgas director general Clare Spottiswoode, TransCo
managing director Harry Moulson said the change in estimate is partly
due to factors exogenous to TransCo including the MMC's revised figures
for the equity risk premium and changes to the advance corporation tax.
 However, he suggests a more specific reason is a change in the
riskiness of TransCo relative to the stock market as a whole.  He said
the beta coefficient had become more volatile and had risen to a value
in the range 0.83-0.93, compared with the MMC beta estimate of 0.86.

Moulson suggests this increase reflects changing market and regulatory
conditions and is likely to continue over the next few years.
Separation of transportation and trading and the introduction of
competition have increased the market-related risk of transportation.
The report suggests "the systematic risk that TransCo faces is
comparatively high in relation to other utilities.  On a qualitative
assessment of the market risk facing utility companies, TransCo ranks
higher than the water and electricity companies, but lower than
telecommunications".  TransCo argues that the company should therefore
have a higher cost of capital, towards the upper end of the range of
7.4%-8.9%.  It suggests "failure to provide this will be to the
detriment of the financial viability of the business and will undermine
incentives to invest".

TransCo is organising a seminar early this year, to which it will
invite Ofgas, shippers and academics to discuss its analysis.  It
intends to publish a second paper on the asset base for consideration.

DECEMBER 1995 FIRM GAS PRICES NEARLY 30% LOWER THAN YEAR BEFORE

A sample of prices from clients of energy specialists John Hall
Associates showed that for customers using more than 25,000 therms per
year, the volume weighted average firm gas price in December 1995 of
18.72 pence per therm was down 3.01 ppt on the previous month (21.73
ppt) and 3.25 ppt below October's average price.  This December price
was down 7.81 ppt (29.4%) compared with the same month the year before
(December 1994, 26.53 ppt).  However, JHA points out that prices for
currently renewable firm gas contracts are significantly lower at
around 11.5 to 12.0 ppt for customers with good volume and load factor,
a little below the levels in November.

The December 1995 volume weighted price of firm gas in the markets
below 25,000 therms was 23.97 ppt, according to Hall sample figures.
This is 7.95 ppt (24.9%) below the price in the same month the year
before (December 1994, 31.92 ppt), and 1.45 ppt lower than the previous
month's figure (November 1995, 25.42 ppt).  New contracts are being
quoted as low as 15 ppt, or even lower if attached to above 25,000
therm volumes, according to JHA.

At 15.11 pence per therm (ppt), the volume weighted average price of
interruptible gas in December 1995 was down 0.36 ppt on the price the
month before (15.47 ppt) and 0.43 ppt less than the average price in
October (15.54 ppt).  This average December 1995 price is 4.40 ppt
below the average price in the same month in 1994 (19.51 ppt) - a
reduction of 22.6%.   As with firm gas prices, the best interruptible
prices for new contract business are considerably lower at between 10
and 11 ppt, with prices having stabilised over the last few months of
1995.

Having remained steady at around 9.05 to 9.10 ppt during late October
and early November, spot gas prices rose sharply in the last half of
November to break through the 10.00 ppt barrier, based on Bacton
prices.  Prices have since stabilised around 9.95 to 10.15 ppt, with
some increases seen during the period of cold weather.

The discount for supplies from St Fergus compared with Bacton was
around 0.20 to 0.25 ppt until around mid November, when it increased to
over 0.30 ppt.  During December, the discount tended to be around 0.2
ppt.  Prices for the first quarter of 1996, based on Bacton, were
around 10.2 ppt in late December, with the differential between St
Fergus and Bacton ranging between 0.45 and 0.65 ppt during the month.

IRISH INTERCONNECTORS FACE FLAK ON SAFETY AND ECONOMIC GROUNDS

Following a demand from George Foulkes MP for a public enquiry into
safety aspects of the construction by British Gas of the Scotland-
Northern Ireland gas pipeline, the Scottish Office has released results
of its preliminary underwater survey.  Concern had been expressed that
recent pipelaying work had disturbed Second World War explosives dumped
in and around Beaufort's Dyke in the Irish Sea.

Phosphorus flares have been washed up along the south-west Scottish
coast, and the British Geological Survey reported underwater explosions
in this area of the Irish Sea.  The Scottish Office report shows that
munitions were strewn in and around Beaufort's Dyke, sometimes in
relatively shallow water, but concluded there was no risk to the public
or marine life.

Offshore pipelaying work by Premier Transco, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of British Gas, was halted briefly in late October, but the prohibition
order was lifted by the Health and Safety Executive after five days (UK
Gas Report, issue 47, 3 November 1995, page 4), allowing the company to
finish laying, trenching and pressure testing of the complete offshore
section of the pipe.

A Premier Transco spokesman told UK Gas Report 42 kms of 24 inch pipe
had been laid and some work had been completed on the onshore section
in Scotland.  This work had been suspended during the winter for
environmental reasons, to reduce land damage, and would resume in the
spring, together with work on the 3km onshore link to the Ballylumford
power plant in Northern Ireland.

He said the project was on schedule for completion in October this
year.  Planning permission had also been given for a pipeline to
Carrickfergus to allow the development of a downstream gas market in
Northern Ireland (UK Gas Report, issue 47, 3 November 1995, page 12).
He anticipated the first customers could be supplied with natural gas
by the end of the year.  It is believed that competition in supply for
industrial and commercial customers will be introduced three years
after the start of operations, with full competition after eight years.

Premier Transco has always claimed its offshore pipelaying work posed
no threat to safety or health and had been carried out in accordance
with government safety procedures.  The Scottish Office suggested more
research was needed to see if there was a conclusive link between work
on the pipeline and the emergence of up to 4,000 incendiary bombs on
local beaches.  Commissioning and operation of the pipeline will be
discussed by Premier Transco, the Scottish Office and the Health and
Safety Executive, and Transco says it will continue to act in
accordance with procedures agreed with the DTI, HSE and Ministry of
Defence.  Foulkes and environmental groups have condemned the survey as
being held too late and in the wrong place.

Meanwhile, Ireland's Department of Energy (DoE) has been criticised for
its role in the completed Scotland-Southern Ireland gas interconnector
pipeline, with claims by the country's Comptroller and Auditor General
that the department got its figures wrong in its estimates for the
$373.5m line.  The comptroller, in a report to the government on the
pipeline, says the DoE made serious blunders in its calculations at the
planning stage of the interconnector.  Administration and design cost
$41.2m, some 45% more than budgeted for, while entire costs overran by
$16.5m.  This the comptroller says, was reasonable.  "The $16.5m
represents a reasonable overrun because the scale and complexity of the
project made cost estimation particularly difficult and also because
extra work above that envisaged had to be undertaken."

However, the DoE is blamed for faulty estimates on its rate of return
to the Irish economy, initially estimated at between 23% and 39% but
eventually found to be only around 15% by the EU which assessed the
project for grant aid.  The comptroller found the rate of return to the
economy to be even lower at only 11%.  The department based its rate of
return calculations on costs of $300m at 1990 prices but sought
government approval for the project based on costs of $360m.  In
addition, no provision was made in estimates of project returns for the
foreseeable costs of developing and upgrading existing natural gas
infrastructure, estimated at $240m.

Controversy continues in Ireland over this interconnector, with critics
claiming it is unnecessary and that had Southern Ireland been patient
it could have taken an overland spur from the British Gas
interconnector at a modest cost of around $45m or less.  However,
others argue that the separate pipeline provides valuable security in
alternative supply options.

BG FACES CLAIMS FROM SERVICE CONTRACT CUSTOMERS LEFT IN COLD

British Gas has confirmed that it will compensate domestic customers
covered under its Three Star Service contracts, after repair services
were severely disrupted by freezing weather conditions over the
Christmas period.  The company faced widespread criticism after an
estimated 150,000 of the 3m customers covered by the #104 contract -
the most expensive and popular of four service agreements offered by
British Gas - were left without heating for up to four days.  Under the
terms of the agreement, British Gas pledges to send an engineer to
repair a faulty system within 24 hours if the fault is reported before
7.30am and depending on demand.

According to a spokesman, British Gas plans to "consider each case on
its individual merit" but will award #10 for each day after the 24 hour
call-out period that a contract customer awaited an engineer.  The
company added that it will consider paying costs incurred by customers
covered by the service who were forced to use another company to carry
out repairs.

The Gas Consumers Council criticised British Gas for the delays which
it said were due to the company's redundancy and restructuring
programme.  The Council added that British Gas had failed to make
contingency plans to cope with the cold period after the Council had
warned the company in early December of potential disruption to
services due to staff shortages.  Ian Powe, director of the Council,
said the problem was "fundamental" rather than seasonal, with
complaints about British Gas service contracts trebling in the year
ending November 1995.  He suggested BG should amend the terms of its
three-star contracts or take on more engineers to provide a better
service to justify the high cost.

Responding to the criticism, British Gas said the number of engineers
operating in 1995 (7,500) was the same as in 1993, and that all
businesses had been affected by the extreme weather conditions.  A BG
spokesman added that during the disruptions, priority had been given to
"customers most in need, particularly the elderly and families with
young children and households suffering from a complete central heating
breakdown".

REGULATORS GIVEN DISCLOSURE GUIDELINES AS REVIEWS CONTINUE

Utility regulation is under the spotlight once again as the London
Stock Exchange issues guidelines for regulators releasing sensitive
information and the Labour Party sets up its policy review of energy
regulation.  In addition, it appears the Committee on Standards in
Public Life, chaired by Lord Nolan, may include utility regulation in
its wide-ranging remit.

The London Stock Exchange guidelines conclude a review of the control
of information which could affect the share prices of companies under
the supervision of privatised utility regulators.  Last summer, a row
erupted when information on price controls provided by electricity
director general Professor Stephen Littlechild to regional electricity
companies was leaked, causing a crash in electricity share prices.  The
new guidelines have been drawn up with the agreement of regulators in
the fields of gas, electricity, water, telecommunications, rail,
aviation, environment, television, gaming, and the Lottery.  The Office
of Fair Trading, although not an industry regulator in the same sense,
has agreed to the same guidelines.

The guidelines include:

* a minimum period - not normally more than 24 hours - between giving
sensitive information to a company and its advisers and releasing it
publicly;

* limitation of access to information on a need-to-know basis;

* advice to be given to other parties on the confidential nature of
information;

* lists to be kept of people to whom information has been shown in
advance;

* notification to the Stock Exchange and companies simultaneously;

* consultation with the exchange in the case of a leak, and if
appropriate, immediate release of information.

However, the voluntary guidelines have a get-out clause in that the
exchange recognises that regulators may not always be able to stick "to
the strict letter of these guidelines".  Critics have also suggested
that the guidelines would not have stopped the electricity price
control leak last year, as Offer officials claim they were already pre-
releasing sensitive information no more than 24 hours before
publication.  Some suggest that only simultaneous release of
information to companies and to the exchange could really guard against
that kind of price manipulation.

Richard Kilsby, director of market services at the exchange, said the
new guidelines would "help to prevent disorderly markets and potential
insider dealing in shares of regulated companies before the official
release of sensitive information by the regulators".

Meanwhile, the Labour Party has begun work on its review of energy
regulation, headed by shadow energy minister John Battle.  He believes
the current structure of regulation has failed the customer in terms of
service and prices and is lacking in transparency and consistency.
Labour is thought to favour a single energy regulator served by a panel
of advisers.  A group of industry specialists is being recruited by the
Party to draft a new regulatory framework.  The subject may also come
under further scrutiny by the current government if Lord Nolan decides
to include utility regulation in this year's programme for the
standards in public life committee.  The recent row over the behaviour
of the Lottery watchdog chief has raised again questions of
accountability and standards for regulators.

CONTRACTING ACTIVITY IN DECEMBER STIRS UP JHA MARKET SHARE FIGURES

Figures provided during December to John Hall Associates (JHA) by firm
gas clients using more than 25,000 therms/yr show some significant
changes in market share, reflecting an increase in activity in December
when many of the contracts on the database were due for renewal.

Mobil remains the market leader in this sector, although it lost 1% to
hold a 22% share.  Kinetica gained 1% to 16%, taking over second place
in the sample from Alliance which dropped 6% to 13%.  Eastern Gas
(eGas) saw its recent aggressive marketing pay dividends with a 6% rise
in share to 11%.  AGAS and Quadrant each gained 1% to 8% and 5%
respectively, while Amerada Hess lost 2% to reach 7% of this market in
December.  The "others" category also fell back 1% on the database.

Similarly, within the sub-25,000 therm sector, there was some movement
in market share figures during December.  Alliance remains the major
player, although its share fell 4% to 30% of the non-BG market in the
JHA sample.  Quadrant (including Gas Direct) maintained its overall 22%
on the database, while eGas gained 1% to 10%.  The "others" category
rose 3% to 10%.

A breakdown of figures provided to JHA by interruptible customers
during December shows a sharp increase in eGas' market share, gaining
4% to reach 17% of the total in the sample database.  Using the JHA
database that now excludes single sites of over 100m therms per year
consumption, Business Gas' (BG Supply's) share of the interruptible
market stayed at 25% in December, while Amerada Hess increased by 1%.

Alliance Gas remains a dominant force in this sector, although it lost
4% to register a 24% share in the December JHA sample.  Alliance showed
falls in all market sectors on the database, reflecting JHA's
perception that the company had been much less prominent during the
latest contracting round.  Alliance told UK Gas Report it had been
considering each renewal carefully in the light of tightening margins,
but it had not changed its policy and was not withdrawing from any
markets.  Other significant players in the interruptible gas market
include United Gas (7%), Accord (6%) and Quadrant (5%).  AGAS, Mobil
and Amerada Hess each have a 4% share on the JHA interruptible
database.

EUROPEAN COMMISSION ADOPTS ENERGY POLICY WHITE PAPER

At a meeting on 19 December, the European Commission adopted energy
commissioner Christos Papoustis' proposal for a white paper, entitled
"An energy policy for the European Union", which lays down guidelines
for EU energy policy into the next decade.  However, Papoustis raised
the question of whether it will be possible to achieve the white
paper's objectives without the addition of an Energy Chapter to the
European Treaty - currently the subject of ongoing discussions.

The white paper is the outcome of detailed discussions and
consultations held on the EC's green paper, which was published in
January 1995.  It sets out three strategic objectives for EU energy
policy: overall competitiveness; security of energy supply; and
environmental protection.  To achieve its objectives, the white paper
has established a number of policy guidelines, the first of which is
integration of energy markets.  Liberalisation of the internal market
for electricity and for natural gas is considered to be the key factor
in market integration.

The second policy guideline deals with concerns over the increasing
energy dependency of the EU.  However, the Commission feels that
despite the political risks in some important supplier countries and
growing world energy consumption, security of supply does not at
present warrant crisis measures.  Instead, the Commission will aim to
encourage fuel diversification, energy efficiency and renewable energy
sources as a means of helping to preserve security of supply.

The Commission sees no inherent conflict between improving
competitiveness and protecting the environment and recognises that the
internalisation of environmental costs and benefits offers a way to
integrate environmental concerns by working with the market rather than
against it.  The need to promote sustainable development means the
Commission will seek to encourage energy efficiency and the use of
renewables via a range of policy instruments.  The Commission also
agreed that the role of local authorities should be given more
recognition in national and Community energy policies, as many aspects
of energy policy affect local communities.

Speaking at the meeting where the white paper was adopted, Commissioner
Papoustis said: "A sound and sustainable energy policy is critical for
our future economic development.  This white paper will be our blue-
print for action into the 21st century".  Papoustis outlined the
importance of the paper's objectives to achieve environmental
protection, secure energy supplies, job creation, industrial
competitiveness and balanced regional development.  However, he said:
"If we are to achieve all these objectives, the Commission must raise
the question of whether a modification of the Treaty is necessary, as
Community action is now limited by the absence of clear provisions".

ONSET OF WINTER SEES N.SEA GAS OUTPUT SURGE IN NOVEMBER 1995

British gas production was up 51% in November over the month before,
and 25% higher than in November 1994, according to the latest Royal
Bank of Scotland Oil and Gas Index.  Production reached 8,551 million
cubic feet per day (MMcfd), taking the bank's gas index to 251.6.  Gas
sales were helped not only by the colder weather but also increasing
demand for electricity generation, said the bank.  Gas revenues were
estimated to have risen by #5.17 million a day to #15.86 million a day
during November last year, about 28% higher than in the same month in
1994.  Gas production was at its highest level since March last year.

British Gas' Morecambe field saw the largest increase in output, up 754
MMcfd to 1,325 MMcfd in November.  BP's Bruce field was up by 195 MMcfd
to 667 MMcfd.  Hamilton's Ravenspurn field increased by 194 MMcfd to
291 MMcfd, Marathon's East Brae was up 150 MMcfd to 438 MMcfd, Shell's
Sole Pit field output rose by 136 MMcfd to 339 MMcfd and Shell and
Amoco's Indefatigable field produced 311 MMcfd, up 70 MMcfd on October.
 BP's Cleeton field came back into strong production, rising from just
1 MMcfd to 197 MMcfd.

There were few falls in production, but Mobil's Beryl and Conoco's
Murdoch fields fell by 43 MMcfd to 372 MMcfd and by 41 MMcfd to 38
MMcfd respectively.  At the terminals higher production saw Bacton and
Barrow increase throughput by 752 MMcfd and 754 MMcfd respectively.
Easington increased by 483 MMcfd.

ROUND TABLE CALLS FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN ENERGY LIBERALISATION

The UK Round Table on Sustainable Development will shortly publish a
report giving broad support for energy market liberalisation, but
calling on the government to set a framework which ensures that energy
markets operate in a way that is consistent with sustainable
development.

The round table is a government appointed committee, set up to provide
advice to the government on sustainable development in the wake of the
Rio environmental conference.  It is chaired by secretary of state for
the environment, John Gummer, and includes representatives from
business, environmental organisations and academics.

At its meeting on 11 December, the round table suggested the
development of competitive markets should increase efficiency of
production and supply and generally provide benefits of reduced prices
and better services for customers.  However, it felt that the market
would not of itself meet all the environmental and social objectives of
a sustainable energy policy.

For this reason the round table concluded that the government should
set objectives and be prepared to use economic instruments, incentives
and regulation where necessary, to ensure that liberalisation is
achieved in the context of a sustainable energy policy.

EUROGAS SLAMS COMMISSION DIRECTIVE ON INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING

The proposed European Commission directive on integrated resource
planning (IRP), aiming to introduce rational planning techniques in the
electricity and gas distribution sectors, is "unnecessary, potentially
harmful and discriminatory, as far as gas is concerned" according to
the European Union of the Natural Gas Industry, Eurogas.

The group calls for the directive to be withdrawn and for EU policy to
focus on developing economic conditions, to encourage energy efficiency
through a competitive, commercial market structure.

Eurogas' main objection to the IRP directive proposal, which covers
rational planning activities in both the gas and electricity sectors,
is that it fails to take account of recent efforts by the gas industry
to increase efficient, economic and environmentally acceptable energy
supply and consumption.

These include end-user instruction on efficient energy use, the
promotion of energy audits, R&D into and increased use of energy
efficient appliances and plant, and cooperation with the construction
industry to encourage energy efficient housing, according to Eurogas.

Eurogas also believes an IRP directive is "potentially harmful" since
it threatens to intervene in market conditions where the need for
additional regulation is "not explained or documented".  In particular,
Eurogas says, commercial competition encourages the development of
efficient energy services, especially where companies must compete
against other energies to offer "best economic conditions to their
customers' needs, which includes energy efficiency and low cost, and
which applies to gas as much as to the alternative fuels".

Furthermore, the proposal is unfairly biased towards gas and excludes
other energies which compete in the same market and on balance
"contribute for each unit of energy produced more to greenhouse gas
emissions", said Eurogas.  Bearing in mind that the objective of the
IRP directive proposal is to reduce emissions, Eurogas feels that the
energy efficient merits of gas over other energies such as oil should
be given greater consideration.

Finally, the group points out that the directive "ignores and
misrepresents the actual situation in the European energy market" by
referring to out-of-date studies relating to electricity.

Instead, Eurogas calls on the Commission to compile a comprehensive
study of Europe's energy market needs and of possible initiatives to
"support existing policies and practices promoting energy efficiency in
the market place", with a view to publishing the findings as a
Commission Communication or Recommendation.

POWERGEN CHP CONTRACT TO SUPPLY CONOCO'S HUMBER REFINERY

PowerGen CHP Ltd has been awarded a contract to supply the electricity
and steam requirements of Conoco Ltd's Humber Refinery.

The contract, which reflects a long-term commercial relationship
between the companies, will involve the construction of a new gas-fired
combined heat and power plant rated at 24 megawatts electrical and over
90 megawatts thermal.

The CHP plant - with capital costs of almost #23 million - will feature
four independent gas turbines with back-up systems to ensure continuous
running even when the primary gas supply is unavailable.

To coincide with the plant construction, a connection between the
refinery and the existing Theddlethorpe to Killingholme gas pipeline
will be installed by Kinetica, the PowerGen/Conoco joint venture.

PowerGen CHP managing director Bob Kennett said: "We have broken new
ground in meeting the requirements of Conoco for efficient but flexible
plant.  Both parties can be confident that the energy supply will
support the refinery's demands in future."

STATOIL CONSIDERING SELLING ESTUARY FUELS

Statoil is thought to be considering selling its Irish oil and gas oil
importer, Estuary Fuels Ltd, which it acquired recently when it took
over Aran Energy, the Dublin explorer.

Estuary is 80% owned by Statoil, with the remainder held by Irish
farmer co-ops who are thought to be keen to liquidate their holdings
and diversify into CHP.

Estuary leases 44 petrol filling stations in the south and south west
of Ireland and owns a further two.

Two potential buyers are thought to have considered Estuary prior to
the successful Statoil bid for Aran, and Bord na Mona, the state peat
producer, is considered a likely buyer.

Bord na Mona is keen to diversify into other energy markets, including
gas.  The peat company was recently freed of most of its debt mountain
by the Irish government, and is managed by Dr. Eddie O'Connor, formerly
head of energy supply purchasing at state electricity company, ESB.

NESTE TO SELL ITS 50% SHARE IN SOVEREIGN

Following the completion of the sale of Neste's UK oil assets to Sands
Petroleum AB, Neste Oy, the Finnish oil, energy and chemicals company,
has agreed to sell its 50% share in Sovereign Exploration Ltd to
Northgas Ltd, a subsidiary of Northern Electric plc.

In January 1994 Neste and Northern Electric formed an upstream gas
company based on Neste's Southern Gas Basin interests, including the
Victor gas field (UK Gas Report, issue 4, 28 January 1994, page 1).

In addition to Victor, Sovereign Exploration has holdings in the
Schooner field which starts production at the end of 1996 and in the
Windermere development.

Neste has stated its intention to focus its upstream activities on
Norway, the Middle East and Russia.  Coinciding with the sale of its UK
activities, Neste is relocating its international business unit (which
is responsible for activities in the Middle East) from London to new
offices in Dubai.

IRISH BOTTLED GAS COMPANY TRADING PROFITABLY

Blugas plc, the Irish bottled gas company that fell into surprise half
year losses of Ir.#400,000 to the end of September last, now says it is
trading profitably, having shed top management and drafted in
accountants to manage the company short term.

However, part or the entire equity of this company may be sold.  Around
70% of the equity is Swiss controlled, through Jones group plc of
Dublin, with the remainder held by Irish interests.

Some of this equity may be taken up by Irish state peat board, Bord na
Mona, already selling peat and coal to households, and keen to expand
into other energy products.

Blugas has around 15% of the local bottled gas market, a fiercely
competitive market dominated by Calor and Flogas.

Calor and Flogas combined last year with Temp Technology of Dublin for
an assault on the local LPG-CHP market, but Blugas was excluded.

BRISTOL CITY COUNCIL TENANTS TO BENEFIT FROM NEW CHP SYSTEM

Bristol City Council and its tenants are to benefit from lower energy
bills and better heating following the installation of a new, high
efficiency combined heat and power (CHP) system at the City's Barton
Hill estate.

The project, according to the CHP Association, was supported by a grant
of #75,000 from the Association's Residential CHP Programme.

The new CHP system generates heating for the 715 homes on the estate,
and power to offset the City Council's electricity costs.

CHPA said that tenants across the city will benefit from the energy
cost savings which CHP's inherently high efficiency delivers to the
council - a proportion of the savings will be invested in further
initiatives by the City's Energy Efficiency Unit. Meanwhile electricity
bills for the City's Council House will be reduced by an estimated
#43,000 a year.

The new system, opened on 7 December by CHPA vice president Peter Rost,
is the latest in a series to be supported under the #2 million
Residential CHP Programme, created and managed by the CHPA for the
Energy Saving Trust.

CAMPAIGN TO WIN SUPPORT FOR DISPOSAL OF OFFSHORE INSTALLATIONS

The oil and gas industry has launched a campaign to win over public
support for a wide range of disposable strategies for its redundant
offshore  installations.

The industry has refused to rule out deep sea dumping as an option for
the future, despite the Greenpeace Campaign which forced Shell to
abandon its plans to dump the Brent Spar facility. However, players
have acknowledged the need to be more transparent and open when
considering options.

"Events of the past few months have persuaded the industry that we need
to do more to understand better public concerns and to encourage
positive participation on the issue," said Dr Harold Hughes, director
general of the UK Offshore Operations Association (UKOOA).

With over 300 oil and gas installations due for decommissioning in the
North Sea and North Atlantic, Hughes estimated about 50 installations
could be decommissioned in the next decade at a cost of #1.5 billion.
As much as half of that cost would be met by the taxpayer.

UKOOA has suggested at least 75% of the installations will be disposed
of on land.

The European Commission will be reviewing the "economic and
environmental aspects" of the dumping of platforms in its review this
year.

However, no decision has been made in Brussels on whether to ban deep
sea dumping.

BORD GAIS OFFERING GRANT TO SWITCH TO NATURAL GAS

Irish state gas distributor, Bord Gais, is offering households a grant
of Ir.#800 to switch heating systems to natural gas.

This scheme is believed to be annoying the local LPG, electricity and
coal industries,

who see it as an abuse of the state company's monopoly position.

There is also independent criticism from builders, who claim they
notice in the course of renovation of homes that owners wastefully
leave on their central heating, even in summer.

It is claimed householders are trying to use sufficient units to reach
targets set by Board Gais that bring qualification for company bonus

Other critics suggest Ireland is giving little thought to likely gas
prices in the decades to come, assuming a never ending era of low gas
prices.

HOUSEHOLD BILLS COULD RISE BY ONE THIRD

Charity Age Concern has estimated that the average household bill could
rise by almost one third this winter because of the bitterly cold
weather and the addition of 8% VAT to domestic gas bills.

The government has a system of cold weather payments for households
which are payable when the temperature falls to freezing for seven
consecutive days.

However, only certain people are eligible for the #8.50 allowance.

To qualify for the payment, recipients must be claiming income support
and either 60 or over and claiming the basic state pension, disabled or
living with a disabled person, or with a dependent child under five.

TESORO RE-ASSURES JOBBERS FOLLOWING BOARD OVERTHROW THREAT

Dissident shareholders may push Tesoro to sell refining
division, following move to oust entire board of directors.

Bid, led by Lafayette, La.-based Stone Energy Corp. chairman
James H. Stone, seeks to improve company value through increased
stock price.

To reach that goal, group would install handpicked board and
likely sell off Tesoro's refinery business to focus instead on
exploration and production, according to papers filed with
Securities & Exchange Commission Dec. 26.

Shareholder action comes on heels of company decision to pull
out of California market (OW 12/25).

Company shuts down terminals at Sacramento, Calif., (172,000
barrels) and Stockton (57,000 bbl.) by mid-January.

Meantime, Tesoro's branded push in Pacific Northwest (OW 7/3)
shouldn't be affected by legal swirl.

Several Tesoro jobbers in Oregon told Oil Week last week that
company has assured them Tesoro flags will continue to fly
regardless of shareholder suit outcome and shut-down of
California terminals.

"We're not concerned by news" after talking with marketing rep,
jobber said.

Other jobbers report sales have picked up since they rebranded
to Tesoro.

Portland-area jobber Johnson Oil rebranded Astoria station in
June and followed with Seaview and Knappa sites in Fall.

"The brand's working," jobber said.  Johnson will rebrand fourth
station in Manzanita when it gets signage approval from city
council.

Tesoro spokesman declined to comment on dissident shareholder
suit.

Stone spokesman also declined comment.  However, Stone Energy
issued statement last week saying move was part of Chairman
Stone's personal investment strategy and not a company action.

GREENS SLAM ELECTRIC CAR DELAY

California Air Resource Board staff report recommends axing 2%
electric car sales in 1998, delaying "zero-emission vehicle"
mandate until at least 2003.

CARB would vote on final plan in March following public
hearings.

Agency earlier told staff to come up with a new plan because E-
car technology is too primitive, expensive and consumer-
unfriendly (OW 11/27).

ZEV Environmental Alliance, a "green" group favoring electric
cars, fears latest CARB delay may be prelude to yet another E-
car delay when 2003 deadline for 10% ZEV sales approaches.

Massachusetts and New York may also delay any ZEV mandate
because they're following whatever California does.

Anti-ZEV group, Californians Against Hidden Taxes (CAHT),
praises CARB staff report for axing 1998 deadline.

But group says it's dismayed that CARB plan would eventually
mandate electric cars, since that would only result in a 1% air
quality improvement at a cost in excess of $20 billion.

CAHT spokesperson Anita Mangels says it's time for CARB to look
for other, more cost-effective measures to clean up the air.

CARB might "chicken out" on costly, consumer-unfriendly ZEV
mandate as 2003 approaches, but Mangels says consumers have no
assurance that.

Many observers feel CARB can't mandate ZEVs in 1998 because of
growing voter/consumer revolt against costly, impractical
government mandates and subsidies.

DEALERS ASK COURT TO STOP BELOW-COST

Below-cost sales fight in Southern Florida heats up, with a
jobber filing a below-cost selling lawsuit against an Amoco
branded retailer.

Jobber, Maximo Investments, is joined by Mobil dealer Jorgelina
Lago, M & H Citgo, and Sunshine Gasoline Distributors in suit
against ISJ Energy.

Suit, filed in circuit court in Dade County, also names Jay
David Weinstock as defendant.

Suit seeks damages in excess of $45,000 under state's Motor Fuel
Marketing Practices Act.

Sunshine owns and manages Miami Palm Plaza Mobil with Lago as a
contract operator.

Sunshine also provides management services for a Miami-area
Citgo station owned by Maximo.

M & H Citgo is a contract operator for Maximo's station.

ISJ owns an Amoco branded station nearby, managed by Weinstock.

Florida law prohibits below-cost sales where the effect injures
competition.  Retailers are, however, allowed to sell below
their cost in order to meet competition.

Suit alleges Amoco station has sold between 7-11 cents/gal.
below cost on all grades since November 1.

That's in a market where dealer laid-in cost was about
$1.059/gallon for regular unleaded and retailers were selling
for 99.9 cents/gal.

Suit seeks actual damages in excess of $15,000, plus attorney's
fees.  Suit also seeks injunctive relief.

ISJ signed consent decree with attorney general in 1992 for
below-cost selling at another Amoco branded outlet.

In light of alleged violation of consent decree, suit requests
court treble actual damages.

Retailers in Southern Florida complain Attorney General rarely
enforces below-cost law because it is unpopular politically.

So, jobbers and dealers are taking matters into their own hands
in the courts.

SUWANNEE SWIFTY EXITS ALA.

Florida-based C-store chain Suwannee Swifty completes exit from
Alabama with sale of four stores to Griffin, Ga.-based
PetroSouth.

PetroSouth, which operates about 135 units in Alabama and
Georgia, will rebrand the sites to Citgo or its own brand,
company says.

Sites will be rebranded first quarter 1996.

Buy is part of PetroSouth's goal to grow by at least 50
locations by end of 1996.

Company plans to move into in Florida early 1996.

Meantime, Suwannee Swifty's exit from Alabama is part of
company's plan to focus on core markets, company says.

Company raised eyebrows in Tallahassee, Fla. this month when it
closed three stores overnight.

One store still had help wanted sign in window, while another
had a happy holidays sign on reader board.

Suwannee Swifty says closures were planned.

Company says although it is consolidating now, it expects to
start growing in core markets early in 1996.

Company now operates about 200 stores in South Georgia and
Northern Florida.

ALTERNATE FUELS MAY GET VASTLY CHEAPER COMPETITOR

Engine/heavy equipment giant Caterpillar takes another big
stride in quest to prove its "A-21" naptha/water/surfactant
emulsion as a clean, cheap alternate fuel.

Fuel has made headlines since Caterpillar's announcement last
year of a scientific breakthrough with new fuel, invented by
scientist Rudolph Gunnerman of A-55/Advanced Fuels of Reno,
Nevada.

Fuel is an emulsion of about half water and half petroleum
naptha; large-volume production eventually would cost about 35
cents/gallon ex-tax at refinery gate.

Plus, fuel would get about same mileage as conventional diesel
or gasoline, according to company test results submitted to
Nevada Bureau of Air Quality.

Fuel would require no changes to oil industry distribution
structure and only minor, relatively cheap changes to engines.

Fuel also would save refiners from further costly upgrades to
refineries and eliminate costlier alternate-fuel competitors.

Few details about the fuel have emerged since initial
announcement.

However, Nevada just certified A-21 fuel for use as a clean
alternative fuel, with a ringing endorsement from Gov. Bob
Miller.

Now, Nevada State Energy Office says it's pushing for
demonstration of A-21-fueled power generator at a new alternate-
fuels facility, formerly the nuclear Nevada Test Site.

Still, Caterpillar has yet to register A-21 fuel with EPA or get
it certified by federal Dept. of Energy as an "alternate fuel"
that fleets could use to meet costly Energy Policy Act mandates.

But company officials met with DOE Secretary Hazel O'Leary
recently, and a DOE policy office has begun to take a look at
the fuel, we've learned.

Meantime, several demonstration test projects are underway, some
involving stationary engines and some involving motor vehicles.

Test results submitted to state of Nevada for designating A-21
as an "alternate fuel" describe fuel as an emulsion of 52% water
(by weight) and 48% hydrocarbon plus 0.5% hydrocarbon surfactant
holding fuel in stable emulsion.

Fuel could be used in either spark or compression-ignition
engines.

Spokesman for Advanced Fuels, Caterpillar's joint-venture
partner in fuel, says water emulsion keeps engine temperature
down, allowing slower, more complete combustion and much lower
emissions.  Similar principle was used in World War II
airplanes.

A nickel catalyst installed in cylinder, possibly employing a
small nickel plate or a nickel spark plug, might promote
combustion of hydrogen molecules in water-fuel emulsion, or so
theorizes fuel's inventor.

In any case, water vapor is a major component of tailpipe gases,
even if water molecules actually provide little or no energy.

Test results submitted to Nevada Bureau of Air Quality show fuel
passes California's tough Phase 2 emission regs and EPA's tough
new regs for diesel engine emissions.

Assuming fuel passes federal regulatory hurdles, marketing would
initially target diesel fleets, then any fleets in areas
affected by "alternate fuels" mandates.

Fuel would require dedicated tank storage.  In extra-cold areas,
fuel may require some ethanol blending to prevent icing.

If demand grows enough, then shipping from naptha
refiner/blenders via pipeline to terminals would become more
feasible, an Advanced Fuels spokesman says.

TOP CHEMIST, JOBBER: CLEAN ENGINE BEATS ALTERNATE FUEL

Properly-tuned cars with properly-maintained oil and fuel
systems do far more to prevent air pollution than multi-billion-
dollar alternate fuels programs.

That's what University of Denver chemistry professor Don
Stedman, inventor of increasingly-popular "remote sensing
device" (RSD) pollution detector, has been telling EPA for years
(OW 1/2/95, 2/21/94).

But politicians have had more fun beating up on oil companies by
mandating costly alternate-fuel programs, rather than insisting
consumers keep their vehicle systems clean, Stedman says.

About 10% of cars on the road today cause most air pollution,
studies show.

So, detecting those "gross polluters" and then fixing them with
good maintenance would save U.S. consumers and taxpayers
billions of dollars wasted on alternate fuels and oxy-fuels.

California jobber Steve Kludt heartily agrees with Stedman.

That's why Kludt has been trying to get government agencies to
promote good maintenance over alternate fuels.

He's also prodded one local agency to test "Super Tune" oil and
fuel system cleansing additive, a mixture of common, well-known
chemical solvents that he's marketed to fleet accounts for
years.

Kludt agrees that well-tuned vehicles with good maintenance and
regular oil changes don't necessarily need an extra dose of
cleaning solvents to cut air pollution.

But some vehicles do need that extra shot of engine cleanser
from time to time.

Fleet vehicles can even extend oil change intervals, offsetting
cost of the solvent additives, he says.

Unlike goofy fuel-system magnets and other "secret formula"
snake-oils, Super Tune is nothing more than toluene, methyl-
ethyl-ketone, isopropyl alcohol and a lightweight mineral
carrying oil.

Those are well-known, common oil/chemical industry solvents,
Stedman confirms.

While Stedman personally doesn't recommend any sort of
additives, he concedes that perhaps 10% of vehicles may
occasionally need something extra, such as solvents, to remove
pollution-causing dirt from engines.

As Kludt explains, "you cannot properly tune an engine if it has
crankcase and fuel system deposits."

Cleaning those systems, properly tuning vehicle and changing oil
regularly will cut pollution dramatically.

Ironically, auto manufacturers now push 50,000 mile tuneups and
lengthy oil change intervals.  That not only causes pollution,
but could ruin engines.

Planned obsolescence could explain those automaker
recommendations, Kludt says.

Meantime, consumer revolt against costly alternate fuels
continues to grow, as evidenced by more states opting-out of
costly RFG programs and California beginning to back-off
electric-car and natural-gas-car mandates.

So now may be right time for oil industry to propose far-less-
costly alternatives, such as better emissions inspections, tune-
ups for dirty cars and proper oil/fuel system maintenance.

While many automotive aftermarket bottlers target dirty fuel
systems, "nobody thinks about crankcase deposits," Kludt says.

Those deposits can foul PCV valves, which in turn cause tailpipe
pollution.  Proper oil changes, plus a solvent treatment for
especially-dirty cars, could clean up crankcases that cause so
much pollution.

At only about $3.75 per bottle with regular oil changes,
solvents such as Super-Tune could fix pollution problems a lot
cheaper than $40,000 electric cars, $30,000 CNG cars or RFG
gasolines costing 10-25 cents/gal. more than ordinary gasoline,
Kludt maintains.

Kludt also says he hopes to get more jobbers interested in
promoting maintenance over alternate fuels.

10TH CIR.: WILLIAMS BOUND
TO BUY GAS BEYOND 20-YEAR
TERM OF 'TAKE-OR-PAY' PACT

     The 10th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled Dec. 5 that,
under the terms of a 20-year "take-or-pay" natural gas purchase
contract forged in 1982, Williams Natural Gas Co. is obliged to
continue buying gas beyond the contract period if the plaintiff
sellers do not revise prices or contract terms.  Talus Properties
Limited Partnership et al. v. Williams Natural Gas Co., No. 95-
1056 (10th Cir.).

     Seeking reversal of a U.S. District Court ruling affirming
the validity of the contracts with plaintiffs Yuma County Oil
Co., Talus Properties Limited Partnership and others for natural
gas produced in Yuma County, CO, Williams argued that the
agreements were ambiguous.  Williams said the U.S. District Court
for the District of Colorado erred in rejecting its request to
enter extrinsic evidence of the parties' intent to remedy the
ambiguity.  It also said the trial judge erred in not reaching
its claim in favor of reformation of the agreements.

     In a non-binding order and judgment, the 10th Circuit said
the contracts were clear and unambiguous.  "The primary term of
each of the contracts is twenty years.  Once the primary term
expires, the contract will remain in effect under the same terms
and conditions, unless, during the allotted time periods, the
respective plaintiffs offer to sell the defendant the gas under
different terms and conditions," the panel ruled.  "Because the
relevant provisions are unambiguous, defendant cannot introduce
extrinsic evidence to vary or contradict their terms."

     The panel said Williams' purported extrinsic data is not
permitted because it is not evidence of additional contract
terms.  "Under the plain language of the contracts, defendant
continues to be obligated to purchase gas from plaintiffs after
the expiration of the primary term unless plaintiffs offer
defendant a new price for the gas, which defendant rejects.
Defendant, however, wants to introduce extrinsic evidence that it
contends establishes that defendant has no obligation to purchase
gas from plaintiffs after the expiration of the primary term.
Because the evidence would vary, rather than supplement, the
written terms, it is not admissible under the guise of CO Rev.
Stat. Sec. 4-2-202(b)."

     The 10th Circuit's opinion, by Circuit Judge Deanell Reece
Tacha, said there was no evidence to support Williams' claim that
the contracts should be reformed because of the mutual mistake of
both parties of not including provisions for a drop in natural
gas prices.

     "The provisions at issue originated with defendant and
became part of the final contracts without any discussion by the
parties.  Nothing suggests that plaintiffs failed to consider the
possibility of future declining prices when they executed the
respective contracts," concluded the court.  "To the contrary,
the contracts work to plaintiffs' advantage in a declining
market.  Nor is there any evidence that plaintiffs knew at the
time they executed the contracts that defendant's assent to the
contracts was based on its mistaken belief that future gas prices
would not fall."

DC CIR. VOIDS FERC'S
INTERPRETATION OF 1968
GAS SALE CONTRACT

     The District of Columbia Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on
Dec. 12 vacated a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission order that
said a 1975 gas sale contract between Jack Grynberg and Rocky
Mountain Natural Gas Co. was illegal because the gas sold under
the pact was dedicated to interstate commerce in a 1968 contract
between Grynberg and another interstate pipeline.  Grynberg et
al. v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Nos. 94-1699 and 95-
1134 (DC Cir.).

     The court's ruling comes after both Grynberg and Rocky
Mountain challenged the FERC's finding that since the Colorado-
produced gas had been dedicated to interstate commerce, the
maximum lawful price would be lower than the price paid by Rocky
Mountain.  Grynberg contested the FERC's dedication to commerce
ruling, while Rocky Mountain challenged the Commission's refusal
to order Grynberg to refund certain overpayments.

     In an opinion by Judge A. Raymond Randolph, the DC Circuit
said that, even in allowing jurisdictional deference, the FERC's
interpretation of the 1968 agreement between Grynberg and
Mountain Fuel Co. was "not reasonable" because that contract did
not tie future production from those fields to interstate
commerce usage.  The panel remanded the case for further FERC
review without considering Rocky Mountain's petition.

     "The Commission's reading of the contract is entitled to
judicial respect..., but here the Commission has gone beyond a
fair construction to reach a result it has not supported," said
the DC Circuit.  "The Commission viewed the 1968 agreement as
having dedicated all of the gas underlying the fields described
in the contract to Mountain Fuel."  The FERC, said the panel,
improperly derived its finding from an introductory "Whereas"
clause in the beginning of the 1968 contract which states:
"WHEREAS, Seller owns or controls, and desires to sell and Buyer
desires to purchase Seller's share of gas underlying the lands
and leaseholds (subject lands) described in Appendix 'A'...."

     The DC Circuit said the FERC reached its conclusion based on
the introductory clause and "brush[ing] aside" a subsequent part
of the contract (Article II-1) prohibiting application of the
1968 contract to lands adjoining the pertinent wells.  "Ignoring
the rest of the contract, the Commission offers little more than
an assertion to support its idea that the prefatory Whereas
clause defines the scope of the dedication," wrote Judge
Randolph.  "According to the Commission, Grynberg agreed to sell
all of the gas underlying the subject lands to Mountain Fuel.
But if the Whereas clause defines the extent of the obligation to
sell and dedicates all of the gas to Mountain Fuel, what is the
role of Article II-1?"

     Nancy J. Skancke of Grammer, Kissel, Robbins & Skancke
represents Grynberg.  The FERC is represented by Commission
Attorney Jill L. Hall and Solicitor Jerome M. Feit.  John T.
Miller Jr. argued the cause for intervenor Rocky Mountain.  All

5TH CIRCUIT VACATES
APPOINTMENT OF CAJUN
BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE

     Holding that a trial court's appointment of a bankruptcy
trustee for debtor Cajun Electric Cooperative is not in the best
interest of the parties involved, as required under 11 U.S.C.
Sec. 1104(a)(2), a divided Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on
Nov. 20 vacated the appointment at the request of Cajun and
several of its creditors.  In re Cajun Electric Power
Cooperative, Inc.; Cajun Electric Power Cooperative, Inc. v.
Central Louisiana Electric Co., Inc., No. 95-30760 (5th Cir.);
see Utilities Industry LR, July 1995.

     After making a threshold determination that the appointment
of a trustee by a district court sitting in bankruptcy is a final
appealable order, the Fifth Circuit ruled 2-1 that such an
appointment here was wrong because it was based on the trial
court's incorrect assumption that there was a conflict of
interest in the makeup of Cajun's board of directors.

     Cajun chose Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after
sustaining major losses from investments in the ill-fated River
Bend Nuclear Power Facility and then being ordered to lower its
rates by the Louisiana Public Service Commission.  The court
below appointed a bankruptcy trustee for Cajun after board
difficulty by board members in deciding whether to appeal the PSC
order.

     Although the board voted to appeal the rate reduction
ruling, the trial judge said the decision was complicated by the
fact that many Cajun board members were either managers or board
members of Cajun's 12 member companies, all of whom bought power
from Cajun.  A vote to appeal would mean they were attempting to
raise rates for their subsidiary companies; not to appeal would
mean added difficulty for Cajun to pay its debt obligation.  A
trustee was appointed at the request of Rural Utility Service
(RUS), the federal agency from which Cajun received a $1.6
billion loan to invest in River Bend.

     On appeal, the Fifth Circuit majority said that the
appointment of a trustee is an extraordinary remedy under Sec.
1104(a)(1), one for which the moving parties failed to meet their
burden of proof.  The panel said that while the district court
offered several reasons for its decision, they all stemmed from
the inherent conflict between the interests of its member-
customers and those of its creditors.

     "However, because this inherent conflict results from
Cajun's organizational structure " a structure that Congress
encouraged it to adopt " the conflict is insufficient to justify
the appointment of a trustee," said the majority in an opinion by
Judge Reynaldo G. Garza.  "The fact that Congress and the RUS
encouraged " if not required Cajun to organize itself as a
cooperative leads us to believe that any conflict inherently
arising from Cajun's organization as a cooperative is
insufficient to justify the appointment of a trustee."

     "Further," the panel added, "holding that these inherent
conflicts constitute cause for appointing a trustee would create
a per se rule permitting the appointment of a trustee in any case
involving a cooperative."

     Writing in dissent, Judge Emilio M. Garza disagreed with the
majority's per se rule assumption, saying the trustee's
appointment should stand.

     "The conflicts present in this case go beyond the 'inherent'
conflicts under which all healthy cooperatives operate," he said.
"Presumably, healthy cooperatives do not fail to collect monies
owed by member-customers or attempt to deny member-customers
access to information.  Nor do members in healthy cooperatives
consider strategies which seem designed to break-up and scavenge
the assets of the debtor....  Once cooperative members begin
working at cross-purposes, to the extent Cajun's members have,
the appointment of a trustee may be the only effective way to
pursue reorganization."

CONVICTION REVERSED IN
DESTRUCTION OF KY NATURAL
GAS TRANSMISSION TOWER

     A divided Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Nov. 29
reversed the conviction of a defendant who hired people who
mistakenly destroyed an interstate transmission tower owned by a
natural gas company.  United States v. Howard, No. 95-5433
(6th Cir.).

     The 2-1 majority said defendant Ricky Nelson Howard did not
intend to destroy an interstate transmission facility but had
mistakenly targeted the wrong tower.

     Howard, who owned a Kentucky cable television company,
offered to pay a man $1,000 to destroy a tower operated by a
competitor, but mistakenly pointed out a nearby Columbia Gas
Transmission Corp. tower as the target.  That man recruited a
friend to assist.  When Howard refused to pay the $1,000 fee
because the wrong tower had been destroyed, the disgruntled
accomplice contacted the FBI.

     An Eastern District of Kentucky grand jury indicted all
three for conspiracy and aiding and abetting in the destruction
of an interstate facility under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety
Act (NGPSA).  The two men who carried out the destruction pleaded
guilty.  A jury convicted Howard at trial before Judge Joseph M.
Hood.

     The Sixth Circuit reversed in an unpublished, 2-1 per curiam
decision.

     Howard unsuccessfully argued the Columbia Gas tower was a
communication rather than transmission facility and was not a
pipeline facility under NGPSA; it had an electronic system to
convert pipeline pressures and flow rates into electrical signals
and to transmit the results to a central monitoring location.  He
also unsuccessfully argued the tower was exempt from protection
under NGPSA because it was located in a rural area.

     However, the majority said the conviction must be reversed
because the conspirators lacked specific intent to cut down a gas
tower.  As a result, it said a jury could not reasonably conclude
that the defendants knowingly and willfully destroyed a gas
pipeline facility.

     Dissenting, Judge Harry W. Wellford said the mistake as to
ownership of the Columbia Gas tower was insufficient for
reversal.  Howard, in fact, did point out the Columbia Gas tower
to a co-conspirator, he said.

11TH CIR.: GA PRISON
OFFICIALS DUE IMMUNITY IN
POWER CONTRACT BID SUIT

               Although ruling that two low-bidding electric cooperatives
held a state-created property right in electrical service
contracts granted to high-bidder Georgia Power Co. by Georgia's
Department of Corrections (DOC), the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals on Nov. 15 reversed a district court's denial of
qualified immunity for DOC officials and remanded the case for
further state law action.  Flint Electrical Membership Corp. v.
Whitworth et al.; Pataula Electric Membership Corp. v. Whitworth
et al., Nos. 94-9199 and 94-9227 (11th Cir.).

     The court's action came in the consolidated treatment of
separate lawsuits by Flint Electrical Membership Corp. and
Pataula Electric Membership Corp. (the EMCs), which claimed they
were denied their due process rights to supply power to certain
DOC facilities when DOC violated Georgia's State Purchasing Act
and awarded the contracts to Georgia Power.

     U.S. District Judge Horace T. Ward of the Northern District
of Georgia originally dismissed the actions on the pleadings for
failure to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983, holding that
the EMCs had no federally protected property interest in the
contracts.  The 11th Circuit, in an earlier ruling, reversed
Judge Ward on the grounds that Georgia law requires electrical
service contracts to be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder
"whenever possible."

     Holding that DOC officials should have known the are
required to follow competitive bidding procedures, the 11th
Circuit remanded the case to trial court, where DOC and Georgia
Power, also a defendant, moved for summary judgment.  Upon the
court's denial of all such motions, the DOC officials appealed to
the 11th Circuit.

     In a per curiam opinion, the panel found that although the
EMC's right to a property interest in the contracts remain, the
DOC defendants are now entitled to qualified immunity due to a
change in the law under the 11th Circuit's 1994 ruling in
McKinney v. Pate.  In that case, the 11th Circuit held that Sec.
1983 substantive due process claims arising from nonlegislative
deprivations of state-created property interests are no longer
cognizable in the circuit.

     The panel noted that the EMCs should have, but did not, file
suit against DOC in state court under Georgia law O.C.G.A. Sec.
50-5-79, designed to challenge the issuance of improperly bid
state contracts.  "Because they failed to do so, and because the
rule of law announced in McKinney must be applied
retroactively..., their Sec. 1983 due process claims are not
actionable," the court concluded.

DEMAND EXCUSED BY MAJORITY
HOLDER'S INFLUENCE ON
BOARD MEMBER, SAYS DE CT.

     A shareholder plaintiff was excused from making pre-suit
demand on the board of York Research Corp. by a Delaware state
court judge who on Dec. 4 found that a majority of the board
lacked independence due to a dominant director/shareholder's
ability to exert "considerable influence" over a swing vote
director.  Friedman v. Beningson et al., No. 12232 (DE Ch. Ct.).

     In his memorandum opinion, Chancellor William T. Allen
rejected a motion to dismiss breach of duty and insider trading
charges from Delaware Chancery Court, finding that in order to
allege lack of independence, it was not necessary to show that
the swing vote director's continued employment and remuneration
hinged solely on the whim of the controlling director.

     At issue in the derivative suit by Irving Friedman was the
decision of York Research Corp. " a Delaware company that
develops, constructs and operates co-generation power plants " to
issue interest-free loans to several of its directors and
officers so that they could buy large blocks of stock in the
company.  According to the complaint, the directors and officers
then made false statements regarding revenue growth and future
business prospects to inflate York's stock price and sold their
shares before announcing that revenues would be significantly
below projections.

     Friedman alleged that the defendant officers and directors
not only misused corporate office but cost the company a $500,000
settlement used to obtain the dismissal of shareholder securities
suits in federal court in New York City.

     After the suit was amended, defendants in July 1993 moved to
dismiss it for failure to make demand on the board before
initiating the action.  Friedman contended that he was excused
from making pre-suit demand because the majority of the three
board members lacked both independence and disinterest.  He said
defendant York director/president Robert Beningson was the
mastermind of the interest-free loan and insider trading scheme
and that he exerted a controlling interest over board member John
Ellis through his control of his remuneration.

     The court said it need only address the first prong of the
two-prong test used in Aronson v. Lewis, DE Sup. 473 A.2d 805, 8
(1984), i.e., whether plaintiff has alleged particularized facts
creating a reasonable doubt whether those directors could, under
the circumstances, exercise a judgment on the suit and demand
that would qualify for the deference of the business judgment
rule.

     "This inquiry may include the subject whether some or all
directors are 'beholden' to or under the control, domination or
strong influence of a party with a material financial interest in
the transaction under attack, which interest is adverse to that
of the corporation," the court wrote.  "Such circumstances alone
may sometimes raise a reasonable doubt that directors in such a
situation could exercise judgment on behalf of the corporation
concerning the transaction involving such dominant or influential
party."

     The court noted that the state Supreme Court held in Rales
v. Blasband, DE Sup. 634 A.2d 927, 936, that "although the
director/officer's continued employment and remuneration did not
hinge solely on his relations with the defendant directors, the
official authority of the defendant directors 'placed them in a
position to exert considerable influence over the director
officer.'"  Ellis's continued receipt of consulting fees,
"...when considered in the context of the other facts alleged,
represents a substantial interest subject to possible corporate
retribution had he exercised judgment in a way displeasing to the
financially interested shareholder/CEO," the court concluded.

     The court also noted that Beningson's ties to York's
principal client empower him in relation to the other directors,
"...since they must remain cognizant of and sensitive to his
ability to affect York's business prospects."  The chancellor
also noted (1) the size of the loans " the loan to Beningson was
greater than the company's net revenue that year; and (2) York's
settlement of the federal class actions without any director
contribution, despite the profits earned by Beningson.

     Plaintiffs are represented by Joseph Rosenthal and John Day
of Rosenthal, Monhait, Gross & Goddess in Wilmington; and Ronald

CA CT. GRANTS JUDGMENT
FOR DEFENSE IN OFFICE
EMF EXPOSURE CASE

     Holding that the plaintiffs would be unable to submit causal
evidence associating electromagnetic field exposure to the
development of cancer in humans, a California Superior Court
judge on Dec. 8 granted defendant Southern California Edison's
(SCE) motion for summary judgment in a suit by office workers who
say they developed cancer due to the location of an SCE
transformer beneath their office.  Johsz et al. v. Koll Co. et
al., No. 726765 (CA Super. Ct., Orange Cty.); see Utilities
Industry LR, October 1995.

     Orange County Superior Court Judge H. Warren Siegel said he
agreed with SCE's assertion that plaintiffs' proffered testimony
would not meet the Kelly-Frye admissibility test as laid out in
the California Supreme Court's 1976 ruling in People v. Kelly.
Such testimony, which was to have been given at trial beginning
this month, he said, failed to conclusively say EMFs caused
plaintiff's cancers.  The testimony expected from plaintiffs'
experts Samuel Milham, M.D., M.P.H., and David Michael Ozonoff,
M.D., suggested only that "there is a causal association; that
based on statistics it 'may' be a cause," the judge ruled.

     The judge added, "Statistics may lend credence to an opinion
that EMF caused plaintiff's cancers, but there is no expert
opinion that it did in these cases and Ozonoff and Milham are the
only causation experts proposed by the plaintiffs on the EMF
issue."

     Co-defendants Koll Co. and Grubb & Ellis joined in the
utility's summary judgment motion.

     Plaintiffs Michael and Jill Johsz, James and Christianne
Nichols, and Mary Ann Stewart voluntarily withdrew their causes
of action for battery and fraudulent concealment and their
request for punitive damages after SCE moved for summary judgment
on Nov. 7.  Plaintiff attorney Annee Della Donna, who plans to
file a motion for a new trial this month, says the ruling does
not affect companion cases Younkin v. Southern California Edison
(see Utilities Industry LR, September 1995, P. 11,032), in which
a March settlement conference is slated, or Muir v. Southern
California Edison (see Utilities Industry LR, June 1995), which
is scheduled for trial on May 20, 1996.

     The plaintiffs discounted SCE's summary judgment motion
claim that the Kelly-Frye test is inapplicable, arguing that it
applies only to admissibility of "new scientific methods, devices
or techniques" in criminal cases.  Instead, they said that their
conclusions and opinions should be judged, and are shown
reliable, under the 35-year-old "Hill Criteria," developed in
England.  The Hill Criteria, they argued, include strength,
consistency, specificity, temporality, biological gradient,
plausibility, coherence, experiment and analogy.

     "Plaintiffs argue that the Kelly-Frye rule is not applicable
to the scientific principle of whether EMF causes cancer, but
rather is limited to novel scientific techniques, methods or
tests," SCE responded.  "In support of this argument, plaintiffs
cite several California decisions which have held that the Kelly-
Frye rule is not applicable to medical opinion testimony based on
an examination of a particular physical or psychological injury."

     "However," the utility continued, "the cases cited by
plaintiffs on this point are inapposite in that the issue with
respect to Edison's motion for summary judgment is not the
admissibility of medical opinion testimony that EMF caused
plaintiffs' specific cancers, but rather the admissibility of
scientific evidence on the threshold issue of whether EMF causes
cancer generally.  This distinction is highlighted by the fact
that the expert declarations submitted to plaintiffs in
opposition to Edison's motion for summary judgment do not
indicate that either of the declarants have ever examined any of
the plaintiffs in this action, but rather base their opinions
solely upon scientific literature and epidemiologic studies
regarding the health effects of EMF."

     Opposing SCE's motion, the plaintiffs challenged the
qualifications of defense experts Philip Cole, M.D., Chairman of
the University of Alabama School of Public Health's Department of
Epidemiology; and Jack D. Sahl, M.S., M.P.H., Ph.D, an SCE
research scientist since 1983.  Both men, the plaintiffs argued,
"are so tied to the utility companies that their testimony is not
credible."

     SCE replied, "in contrast to the declaration of Dr. Cole
[that there is no causal relationship between human cancer
development and EMF exposure], the declarations submitted by
plaintiffs are devoid of any reference to general acceptance
within the scientific community of the principle that EMF causes
cancer.  Rather than addressing the consensus of the scientific
community, Dr. Milham simply states that there are a number of
biological mechanisms by which EMF 'may' cause cancer, that EMF
'may' affect and compromise the immune system, and that, in his
opinion, EMF exposure promotes a number of cancers."

     The plaintiffs are represented by Della Donna and Wylie A.

SCE is represented by Duncan Barr and Joel C. Lamp of O'Connor,

CA COURT VOIDS FRAUD,
CONDEMNATION, NUISANCE
CLAIMS AGAINST TANC

     A California Superior Court judge ruled Nov. 21 that the
plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of proving that the
Transmission Agency of Northern California (TANC) committed fraud
in refusing to disclose the potential dangers of electromagnetic
fields when it acquired a 200-foot-wide right-of-way across their
100-acre farm in 1991.  Jess et al. v. Transmission Agency of
Northern California et al., No. V-0072568 (CA Super. Ct., Alameda
Cty.); see Utilities Industry LR, Feb. 15, 1994.

     Judge Richard A. Hodge said that although TANC had a duty to
inform John Jess Jr. and his wife, Nell Jess, of the "existence
of a public controversy" concerning the effects of EMF on human
health, TANC did not defraud the couple when TANC right-of-way
agent Robert Gray negotiated a deal to purchase the 11.4-acre
strip of land for $80,960.  Claims for reasonably foreseeable
health hazards resulting from the placement of the 500kV
transmission line, the court added, are moot under a waiver
contained in the right-of-way contract.

     The fraud, inverse condemnation and nuisance suit charged
TANC with failure to reveal that the operation of the line at
full capacity would result in a 1 milligauss (mG) EMF or more
over an area of up to 600 feet from the center of the
transmission line.  The complainants said there was a diminution
of the value of their property as a result of the EMF and that
there was an interference with their use and enjoyment of their
property.

     Weighing the testimony of opposing property appraisers,
Judge Hodge said the estimated valuation drop suggested by
claimants' appraiser Arthur Gimmy was inconclusive because it
failed to differentiate between the loss attributed to EMF fear
and that due to the general installation of a high voltage line
across a rural property.

     "The court...was not persuaded that Mr. Gimmy had adequately
distinguished loss of value from perceived health problems from
loss of value attributed to the manifold negatives otherwise
associated with transmission lines," Judge Hodge wrote.  "In this
regard, it is important to observe that the plaintiffs negotiated
their easement and right-of-way contracts with full appreciation
of the visual, aural, and 'convenience' negatives.  Presumably,
the plaintiffs calculated these negatives in their acceptance of
the $80,960 contract price."

     The court ruled, "The fact that EMF MAY engender biological
effects of unknown consequence is not sufficient to establish a
basis for damages.  Plaintiffs' proof of actual harm derived from
asserted biological effects of EMF has been singularly lacking in
persuasive force."

     Judge Hodge concluded, "Plaintiffs have failed to meet their
burden of proof to establish fraud, inverse condemnation or
nuisance.  Plaintiffs have failed to establish any damages.
There is no established nexus between EMF exposure and any known
health hazard.  While a diminution in property value may be
expected from the proximity to EMF transmission lines, here
plaintiffs have been unable to demonstrate any diminution in
value attributable specifically  to the fear of health hazards as
opposed to other of the known detriments.  Plaintiffs negotiated
and accepted a price for the easement which accurately reflected
the damage to their property."

     TANC is represented by Ivor E. Samson of Sonnenschein Nath &
Rosenthal and by Valerie Smith Boyd of Marron, Reid & Sheehy,
both of San Francisco.  The plaintiffs are represented by Paul N.
McCloskey Jr. and John J. Keating of the Law Office of John

9TH CIR. DETERMINES HEALTH
ASSESSMENT TO CONSTITUTE
REMOVAL OR RESPONSE

     The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 7 affirmed a
Washington federal court's dismissal of a citizens' group's bid
to compel the Agency for Toxic Research and Disease Registry
(ATSDR) to initiate a health assessment program in the region of
the Hanford Nuclear Reservation.  Hanford Downwinders Coalition
et al. v. Dowdle et al., No. 94-35100 (9th Cir.).

     (The opinion is available from Andrews Document Access
Service.)

     The panel agreed that no federal court jurisdiction existed
over the claim and concluded that the ATSDR's ongoing health
assessment activity in the region constituted a removal or
remedial action for the purposes of CERCLA's Timing of Review
provision.

     The litigation stems from ongoing cleanup efforts at the
Hanford facility in Richland, WA, which for some 30 years
produced plutonium for the Department of Defense.  The facility
generated releases of radioactive iodine and other hazardous
substances into the atmosphere, soil and water of the region.

     In 1988, the EPA proposed adding the Hanford site to the
National Priorities List (NPL).  The following year, the EPA,
Department of Energy and Washington Department of Ecology
outlined their response.  The ATSDR was assigned specific
responsibilities under the response plan to prepare preliminary
health assessments, and was given the discretion to expand them
to full health assessments if warranted.

     The Hanford site has remained the subject of continued
research by the ATSDR.  In 1993, the ATSDR declared the site to
be among the Superfund sites posing the greatest threat to public
health, and has applied the results of the Centers for Disease
Control's 1994 study to its criteria for determining whether
medical monitoring would be appropriate.

     Plaintiffs Hanford Downwinders Coalition Inc. (HDC) brought
the instant litigation in July 1993, alleging that the ATSDR has
a mandatory duty under CERCLA Sec. 9604(i)(9) to commence a
health surveillance program in the region, including medical
testing and monitoring for individuals exposed to radioactive
iodine.  The Eastern District of Washington granted the defense's
dismissal motion, concluding that the ATSDR's health-related
activities at Hanford constituted ongoing removal or response
activity, and that the plaintiffs' claim was therefore an
impermissible challenge.

     Affirming, the Ninth Circuit first rejected the plaintiffs'
contentions that the language of the statute supported their
construction of the statute.  The HDC asserted that when Congress
instructed the ATSDR to "effectuate and implement [CERCLA's]
health-related authorities" in Sec. 9604(i)(1) of the statute, it
meant to distinguish these health-related authorities from
"response authorities" as defined under Sec. 9604.  "There is no
indication that Congress' characterization of ATSDR authorities
as 'health related' was intended to render the Sec. 9604
'response authorities' section superfluous as to ATSDR actions,"
the panel rejoined.

     The panel found that the language of Sec. 9604(i)(1) "should
be read narrowly as a means to distinguish between different
types of response authorities, rather than interpreted broadly as
an effort to differentiate ATSDR health assessment and
surveillance activity from response actions protected by the
Timing of Review provision."

     Cautioning that not all Sec. 9604 "response authorities" are
to be considered removal or remedial actions per se, the Ninth
Circuit engaged in an analysis of whether the ATSDR's conduct
could be shown to be removal or remedial activity.  "The ATSDR
health assessment and surveillance activities challenged by the
HDC," the panel wrote, "are a necessary part of the government's
efforts to safeguard the public health at NPL sites....  [The
ATDSR] is an integral part of Congress' effort to protect the
health of those exposed to hazardous releases from facilities
listed on the NPL."

     The court reconciled the instant case with its holdings in
Durfey v. E.I. DuPont (1995) and Price v. U.S. Navy (1994), which
declared that independent private actions for medical monitoring
were not removal or remedial actions.  "The reasoning in Durfey
and Price does not apply to health assessment and surveillance
actions engaged in by a governmental agency pursuant to explicit
CERCLA provisions," wrote the panel.

     The plaintiffs pointed to the structure of CERCLA, noting
that Sec. 9607(a)(4)(A), which provides for the government to
recover "all costs of removal or remedial action," is separate
from Sec. 9607(a)(4)(D), which provides for the recovery of "the
costs of any health assessment" made by the ATSDR.  The panel
rejoined that Sec. 9607(a)(4)(D) was in fact part of the 1986
SARA amendments, and "decline[d] to read the failure of Congress
to accomplish the seamless integration of ATSDR provisions with
the other authorities found under subsection 9607(a)(4)(A) as
compelling proof of Congress' intent to distinguish ATSDR
activities from removal and remedial actions."

     The plaintiffs also pointed to the separate treatment of
response costs and ATSDR costs in CERCLA Sec. Sec. 9611(a) and
9611(c).  Noting the fact that the legislative history was silent
as to why the distinction was made, the panel stated its
obligation "to choose the interpretation that is most consistent
with the remainder of the Act."

     Having established that the ATSDR's conduct constituted
removal or remedial action, the Ninth Circuit disposed of HDC's
assertions that the requirements of the Timing of Review
provision were otherwise unsatisfied.  The panel looked to its
1995 holdings in MESS v. Perry and Razore v. Tulalip Tribes in
concluding that the HDC's suit was a "challenge" to the ongoing
removal or remediation.

     Tom H. Foulds, Seattle, represents the appellants.

     Elizabeth Ann Peterson of the U.S. Department of Justice,
Environment and Natural Resources Division, Washington, DC,
represents the appellees.

9TH CIR. ASKED TO DECIDE
NGA AND 'HINSHAW' STATUS
OF MOJAVE'S CA EXPANSION

     In an intervenor's brief filed Dec. 18, Process Gas
Consumers Group (PGCG) told the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals to reject the California Public Utilities Commission's
petition to vacate two Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
orders asserting regulatory authority over Mojave Pipeline Co.'s
planned 400-mile-plus "Northward Expansion" gas transmission line
from Sycamore, CA to the San Francisco Bay area.  Public
Utilities Commission of the State of California v. Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, No. 95-70611 (9th Cir.); see related
story, Pacific Gas & Electric v. Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, Utilities Industry LR, June 1995.

     PGCG sided with Mojave's Dec. 13 intervenor brief, which
urged the court to affirm FERC authority over the project based
on the FERC's finding that Mojave will neither be (1) engaged in
local gas distribution and subject to state jurisdiction under
Natural Gas Act (NGA) Sec. 717(b); nor (2) under PUC rule through
the NGA's "Hinshaw Amendment" exemption.

     In November, the PUC asked the Ninth Circuit to vacate the
FERC orders (No. 61,194, Feb. 15, 1994; No. 61,167, Aug. 4, 1995)
that rendered void a 1993 PUC order asserting PUC jurisdiction
over the high-pressure line.  The FERC said it holds authority
over the line because it is designed to provide direct
transportation-only service to end-users, not local distribution
retail sales.

     The PUC, however, says the project meets the criteria for
Hinshaw Amendment exemption from NGA rule, which are that,
"(1) the person or facilities must either transport or be legally
authorized to transport gas which is 'received by such person
from another person within or at the boundary of a State';
(2) 'all the natural gas so received [must be] consumed within
such State'; and (3) 'the rates and services of such person and
facilities [must] be subject to regulation by a State
commission.'"

     The PUC argued that "[i]f Mojave's Northward Expansion
application were granted, both Mojave " the 'person' " and the
'facilities' used by Mojave to transport gas received by Mojave
in California and ultimately consumed in California, would be
exempted from FERC jurisdiction by the plain language of the
Hinshaw Amendment.  The FERC is therefore, without jurisdiction
to grant the expansion certificate requested by Mojave.  Such a
certificate can only be granted by the PUC, which has certified
to the FERC that 'it has regulatory jurisdiction over the rates
and services of the Mojave Pipeline Co. and the facilities used
by Mojave to transport gas received by Mojave in California and
ultimately consumed in California and that it is exercising such
jurisdiction.'"

     On Nov. 14, a joint intervening brief was filed on the PUC's
behalf by Associated Gas Distributors (AGD), the National
Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, Pacific Gas &
Electric Co., San Diego Gas & Electric Co. and Toward Utility
Rate Normalization, a consumer action agency that says
residential and small business customers have experienced
significant rate hikes in recent years due to interstate pipeline
bypass.

     AGD and the joint intervenors say the record "amply
demonstrates that Mojave's Northward Expansion project will
engage in the local distribution of natural gas and is therefore
exempt from FERC regulation."  The FERC's assertion of authority,
they add, is "inconsistent with the statutory language,
legislative history, and case law of Sec. 1(b)."

     The PGCG added on the FERC's behalf, "The proposed
facilities are not Hinshaw facilities exempt from the NGA.
Mojave's pipeline crosses the Arizona-California border,
and...Mojave's integrated pipeline transports gas as part of a
continuous stream of interstate commerce.  The fact that some gas
might potentially also be received from Kern River [Gas
Transmission Co.] in California does not change the interstate
character of the transportation.  In order to qualify as a
Hinshaw pipeline, a pipeline must operate exclusively in one
state; Mojave does not.  The mere existence of an extension or
branch located within a state does not render an integrated
interstate pipeline company a Hinshaw pipeline.  Nor would
receipt of gas from another interstate pipeline within the state
alter the multi-state pipeline's interstate character."

     The PUC brief was filed by PUC attorneys Mark Fogelman,
Peter Arth Jr. and Edward W. O'Neill of San Francisco.  Mojave is
represented by corporate attorney Michael D. Ferguson of
Bakersfield, CA, and by Mary Anne Mason, Kenneth L. Wiseman, and
Kenneth M. Minesinger of Andrews & Kurth L.L.P., in Washington,
DC.

     The AGD intervenor brief was filed by Frederick Moring and
Ann H. Kim of Crowell & Moring in Washington, DC.  PGCG is
represented by Edward J. Grenier Jr., William H. Penniman, Glen
S. Howard and Daniel E. Frank of Sutherland, Asbill & Brennan.

CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT
AFFIRMS $1.3M WRONGFUL
DEMOTION AWARD

     A company that demoted two employees without following the
procedures outlined in its personnel manual was ordered to pay
$1.3 million in damages to those workers by the California
Supreme Court on Nov. 13.  Scott et al. v. Pacific Gas and
Electric, No. S042601 (CA Sup. Ct.); see Utilities Industry LR,
April 19, 1994.

     In a unanimous decision on an issue of first impression, the
court said that there was no reason why an employer's policy that
its employees not be demoted except for good cause could not
become an implied term of an employment contract.

     Plaintiffs C. Byron Scott and Al Johnson were engineers with
defendant Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E)'s technical and
ecological services unit when they were demoted in 1988.  Just
prior to the demotion, PG&E's internal auditing department began
an investigation into Scott's and Johnson's supervisory practices
and outside business interests.  According to court documents,
both men were partners in an outside consulting firm, and PG&E
had been informed of this involvement from the outset.

     As a result of the investigation, Scott and Johnson were
accused of being negligent supervisors and of resolving against
PG&E any conflicts of interest that arose from their dual
positions as proprietors of an outside business and employees of
PG&E.  They were suspended with only a brief explanation of the
charges against them and were denied copies of the report.  Their
response to the report was submitted in three days, and contained
extensive documentary support for their denials that they favored
vendors or employees of their outside business while employed by
PG&E.

     Scott and Johnson filed suit, claiming that PG&E breached an
implied contract term not to demote employees without good cause.
Their theory was based on the company's detailed personnel
policies, and there was evidence at trial that PG&E intended to
bind itself to those disciplinary policies.  There was also
testimony that neither Scott nor Johnson had shown any
favoritism.

     The jury found in favor of the employees and awarded them
$1.325 million in economic damages and $75,000 each for emotional
distress.  A divided state Court of Appeal reversed, finding a
contract action for "wrongful demotion" inherently vague.  The
court also concluded that judicial involvement in employment
decisions short of termination would constitute an unacceptable
intrusion into the employer-employee relationship.

     The California high court reversed, agreeing with the
plaintiffs' argument that their breach of an implied-in-fact
agreement with PG&E not to be demoted without good cause is
substantially similar to an action for breach of an implied-in-
fact contract not to be discharged without good cause.  The
latter cause of action was held to be enforceable in Foley v.
Interactive Data Corp., 47 Cal.3d 654 (1988), noted Justice
Stanley Mosk, who delivered the opinion of the court.

     The principle that implied contract terms may arise from an
employer's official and unofficial policies and practices is one
that pre-dates Foley, and has not been confined to the area of
wrongful termination, said Justice Mosk.  Where an employer
promises to confer a significant benefit on an employee " such as
a promise to restrict termination or provide for severance pay "
it is a question of fact whether that promise was reasonably
understood by the employee to create a contractual obligation,
said the court.  Here the jury resolved that issue in favor of
Scott and Johnson.

     Turning to the evidence of an implied contract adduced in
the instant case, Justice Mosk concluded that that evidence was
"not merely substantial, but compelling."  He cited the company
detailed "positive discipline" and testimony from PG&E's own
human resources managers to support the jury's conclusion that
there was an implied contract, and that its terms were not too
vague to enforce.

     Scott and Johnson are represented by Christopher Platten of
Wylie, McBride, Jesinger, Sure & Platten in San Jose.  Counsel
for PG&E is corporate attorney Maureen Fries in San Francisco.

PLAINTIFF IN ILL HEALTH
SEEKS EXPEDITED APPEAL
OF CA DEFENSE VERDICT

     The plaintiff in a personal injury suit against the owners
and operators of the St. Onofre Nuclear Generating Station
(SONGS) will petition the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals
this week for an expedited appeal of a jury verdict in favor of
the defense after losing a bid for a retrial on Dec. 5, according
to his attorney, Don Howarth.   James v. Southern California
Edison Co., No. 94-1085 (SD CA).

     Howarth filed a notice of appeal on Dec. 22.  He said that
his client, Glen James, 63, who is suffering from chronic
myelogenous leukemia, is in rapidly deteriorating health and that
he wants to expedite the appeal on James' behalf "while it may
still do him some good."  James, an engineer, worked at SONGS in
the mid-1980s.

     Howarth moved for a new trial after the eight-person jury
returned a verdict in favor of defendants Southern California
Edison and Combustion Engineering Inc. on Oct. 12.  He argued
that the jury was improperly influenced by the O.J. Simpson trial
and by juror misconduct.

     Howarth argued that the verdict was against the weight of
the evidence, that it was the product of improper passion and
prejudice and that the jury improperly considered extraneous,
prejudicial information.

     According to the motion, one of the jurors, Genevieve
Fitzwater, told the others that she had received radiation
therapy for thyroid cancer and that "it had saved my life."  In
addition, after the jurors were allowed to watch the verdict in
the O.J. Simpson case, Fitzwater also allegedly told the others
that they must apply the same "reasonable doubt" standard used in
the Simpson murder case to the evidence in this case.

     James also alleged that a second juror told a post-verdict
gathering that he had made his mind up for the defense early in
the trial before all of the evidence had been presented and that
he had never wavered in his belief.

     Southern District of California Judge Napoleon Jones Jr.
rejected all of those arguments, finding that under the Federal
Rules of Evidence, most of juror Gregory Hafen's declaration
supporting the allegations of juror misconduct is inadmissible.

     According to Rule 606(b), a juror may not testify to
anything that may have influenced his decision during
deliberations except on the question of whether extraneous
prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury's
attention.

     Under that rule, only Fitzwater's statements about her
radiation treatment and applying the reasonable doubt standard
may be admissible if they can be shown to be extraneous
information and prejudicial by a preponderance of the evidence,
Judge Jones said.

     He ruled, however, that Fitzwater's alleged statements about
her radiation treatment are not prejudicial extraneous
information but "are best classified as personal experience
applied to the evidence in the case...."

     Citing to Hard v. Burlington Northern Railroad Co., 870 F.2d
61 (9th Cir. 1989), Judge Jones said, "The type of after-acquired
information that potentially taints a jury verdict should be
carefully distinguished from the general knowledge, opinions,
feelings and bias that every juror carries into the jury room."

     In Hard, he said, the Ninth Circuit found that it is
acceptable for a juror to use his own personal experience to
interpret the evidence in a case.  In addition, even if
Fitzwater's statements did constitute impermissible extraneous
information, the plaintiff failed to show prejudice by a
preponderance of the evidence.

     On the reasonable doubt issue, Judge Jones found that such
allegations are not admissible because they constitute testimony
on the mental processes of the jury.  He found no Ninth Circuit
precedence on the issue, but he cited two Fifth Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals cases that hold that once a verdict is rendered,
the court may not inquire into the jury's deliberative process to
determine if the jury properly followed the court's instructions
(United States v. D'Angelo, 598 F.2d 1002 [1979] and Robles v.
Exxon Corp., 862 F.2d 1201 [1989]).

     In addition to Howarth, the Jameses are represented by
Suzelle M. Smith of Howarth & Smith in Los Angeles.  Southern
California Edison is represented by Jack Reding of Crosby,
Heafey, Roach & May in Oakland, CA.

CA SUP. CT. TO DECIDE
MOBILE HOME SUBMETER
SYSTEMS RATE DISPUTE

     A consortium of California mobilehome park owners on Sept.
12 asked the California Supreme Court to decide if the state
Public Utilities Commission misinterpreted the public utilities
code in barring park owners from recovering the unreimbursed
costs of operating their submeter utility systems.  Western
Mobilehome Parkowners Association et al. v. Public Utilities
Commission of the State of California, No. S048893 (CA Sup. Ct.).

     Western Mobilehome Parkowners Association (WMA) sought the
court's review after the PUC refused WMA's motion to rehear the
issue in August (Decision Nos. 95-02-090 and 95-08-056).  The
group, whose members operate 5,780 master-meter/submeter electric
and gas distribution systems, says they have been disadvantaged
by the PUC's refusal to let them recover, via rent increases,
system operation costs above the discounted rate provided by
their local utility.

     WMA says that since Public Utility Code Sec. 739.5(a) does
not expressly prohibit parkowners from recovering unreimbursed
costs, the PUC has overstepped its authority and has illegally
engaged in rent control by forcing them to make up the difference
out of their pockets.  The PUC issued the ruling after mobilehome
park residents complained they were, in some cases, being double-
billed for park system maintenance costs, once in the rates they
paid and again in landlord-imposed rent increases.

     The Supreme Court petition maintains that since the
implementation of Sec. 729.5(a), the submetering discount
provided parkowners "has been set based on utility comparable
costs which have been determined to be substantially lower than
the reasonable costs of master-metered mobilehome park owners of
providing submetered service."  It adds that "the PSC in D.95-02-
090 has now decided that as between owners of mobilehome parks
and residents in mobilehome parks, mobilehome park owners must
underwrite all those reimbursed costs, that is losses incurred in
owning, operating and maintaining submetered systems, WITHOUT ANY
RECOURSE."

     In an Oct. 16 answering brief, the PUC says the issue was
appropriately decided because Sec. 739.5 bars subsystem operators
from recovery of costs above the submetering discount.  The PUC
says the legislative intent of the section was not to allow full
compensation for subsystem operations, but to give a "sufficient
differential to cover the reasonable average costs to master-
meter customers of providing submeter service."

     "Moreover," the PUC added, "the regulation may serve a
legitimate public purpose in preventing the potential for the
double recovery of costs by park owner.  The double recovery may
exist if the leases provide for rents that include the capital
costs related to the submetered system, and these same costs are
factored into the discount received by the park owner, and the
tenants do not receive a credit.  Thus, this double recovery
would be a windfall for the park owner.  The elimination of such
a windfall is a legitimate public interest."

     WMA is represented by Richard L. Hamilton and James E. Young
of the Law Office of Richard L. Hamilton in Sacramento.  The
answer was filed by PUC attorneys Peter Arth Jr. and Helen W. Yee
of San Francisco.

DC CIR. REVERSES FERC'S
APPROVAL OF 'BLENDED RATE'
FOR MICHCON GAS SERVICE

     Siding with an ANR Pipeline Co. petition that alleged the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission arbitrarily and capriciously
allowed Michigan Consolidated Gas Co. (MichCon) to employ a
"blended rate" schedule for natural gas transport services, the
District of Columbia Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 12
reversed the FERC ruling and remanded it for further review.  ANR
Pipeline Co. v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, No. 94-1705
(DC Cir.).

     ANR asked the court to review the FERC's decision,
complaining that it violated the Commission's own anti-rate
blending edict in Order No. 636.  In that order, the FERC
mandated use of a straight fixed-variable (SFV) rate plan for
intrastate or "Hinshaw" pipelines operating in cooperation with
interstate lines under Sec. 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act of
1978 (NGPA).

     The panel noted that ANR opposed MichCon's use of blended
rates as an intervenor in FERC proceedings and that the
Commission approved the rate plan despite ANR's insistence that
the approach would provide MichCon the anticompetitive ability to
provide a discount in its rates under Michigan law, which is
unavailable to federally ruled interstate lines.

     "The reasons given by FERC fail to explain why MichCon's
blended rates would not present the ills that FERC concluded in
Order No. 636 would result from continued authority to blend
rates," said the DC Circuit in an opinion written by Judge Judith
W. Rogers.  On remand, said the panel, the FERC must address
ANR's concerns about MichCon's use of blended rates and
"...provide a reasonable justification for excluding MichCon from
the SFV requirements, in view of FERC's conclusions about rate
blending and about the necessity of the SFV rate method to
promoting congressional directives for a natural gas market."

     The court added that the FERC "missed the point" when it
answered ANR's rate-blending concerns by holding that ANR and
other interstate pipelines can remain competitive by discounting
their rates.  "A pipeline that cannot blend rates is unable to
recover fixed costs foregone as a result of discounting its
demand charges.  Conversely, a pipeline with the ability to blend
rates can recover such fixed costs by shifting them from the
demand charge to the usage charge."

     Daniel F. Collins, G. Mark Cook and Christine R. Pembroke of
The Coastal Corp. represent ANR.  The FERC is represented by
Commission Attorney Katherine Waldbauer, Solicitor Jerome M.
Feit, and Deputy Solicitor Joseph S. Davies.  All are located in
Washington, DC.  Intervenor MichCon is represented by corporate
attorney Dennis R. O'Connell of Detroit and Steven H. Neinast of

CA SUP. CT. ASKED TO
REVIEW REQUEST FOR
GAS CONTRACT DATA

     The California Supreme Court has been asked by two utility
consortiums to issue a writ of mandate compelling the state
Public Utilities Commission to open its files on four Southern
California Gas Co. (SoCalGas) natural gas transmission contracts
for inspection under the provisions of the California Public
Records Act.  Southern California Utility Power Pool et al. v.
Public Utilities Commission of the State of California; Southern
California Gas Co., real party in interest, No. S049667 (CA
Sup. Ct.).
               Southern California Utility Power Pool (SCUPP) and Imperial
Irrigation District (IID) comprise publicly owned utilities that
say the PUC violated the public access provision of Sec. 6250-65
when it denied their access requests as contrary to the public
interest.  The PUC conceded that while California Public Utility
Code Sec. 489 charges utilities with the responsibility of filing
and keeping "open to public inspection," rate schedules and
contracts that affect rates, SCUPP and IID, as potential SoCalGas
competitors, are not entitled to view the unredacted contracts.

     Allowing the petitioners access to the proprietary
information on rates charged by SoCalGas under the agreements,
said the PUC, would be unfair because neither SCUPP nor IID are
under PUC regulation, thus denying SoCalGas any opportunity of
requesting inspection of their transmission agreements.  Each of
the pacts at issue was approved under the PUC's "Expedited
Application Docket" (EAD) process, which allows transmission
companies to provide discounts for customers threatening to
"bypass" the utility for another power source.

     The PUC's reciprocity argument, says SCUPP/IID, is
"misplaced" because "neither the members of SCUPP nor IID compete
with SoCalGas to provide gas transmission service.  They operate
publicly owned electric utility systems that consume gas to
generate electricity for their retail electric customers."  SCUPP
includes the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and the
cities of Burbank, Glendale and Pasadena.

     The petitioners told the Supreme Court that the PUC denied
the request despite the fact that it knew the contracts were not
eligible for exemption from public inspection under the Act.
"For an agency to properly apply the law that it is empowered to
enforce, it must first look to the language of the statute to
determine if it is clear.  If the language is clear, the agency
must apply that language," argued SCUPP and IID.  "It is not
within the discretion of the agency to rewrite the provisions of
the relevant statute to fit its goals.  Any actions that are
inconsistent with the clear pronouncement of the legislature must
be overturned."

     In a Dec. 1 answer, the PUC said its actions were warranted
under Public Records Act Sec. 6255, which holds that "the agency
shall justify withholding any record by demonstrating that the
record in question is exempt under express provisions of this
chapter or that on the facts of the particular case the public
interest served by not making the record public clearly outweighs
the public interest served by disclosure of the record."

     The PUC contended that "SCUPP/IID can ignore Commission
orders to disclose records while demanding (as it does here) that
the Commission order SoCalGas to disclose the very same type of
document.  The legislature did not intend to create unfair
competition.  That is exactly what will happen under SCUPP/IID's
version of the law in this case in that SoCalGas would be placed
in an unfair competitive position in negotiations with SCUPP/IID
and other entities if disclosure of its similar gas contracts is
required.  On these facts, the conclusion that non-disclosure
outweighs disclosure was lawful."

     On Nov. 21, SoCalGas, as real party in interest, filed a
Supreme Court brief opposing the writ petition.  It said the PUC
properly based its denial of the contract access requests on the
increasingly competitive California natural gas market.  "The
Commission's EAD decision noted that in light of the imminent
threat of bypass of historic public utility facilities (two major
new interstate pipelines have commenced service in California
since 1990, providing service to customers previously served by
SoCalGas), the Commission determined to prevent public disclosure
of the information in arrangements which could be detrimental to
the competitive position of the public utility company and its
remaining ratepayers during the period such bypass threats
continue.

     SoCalGas says the Records Act, based on the federal Freedom
of Information Act, "was enacted with the clear intent to exempt
from disclosure those documents on file with the government
which, if made available, would result in business disadvantage
to a company vis-a-vis its competition."  SCUPP and IID's
discussion of the Act, it adds, "fails to comment specifically on
the long-standing exception to disclosure for BOTH corporate
trade secrets and commercial information likely to cause
competitive harm."

     The petitioners are represented by Norman A. Pederson and
Kirstin Porter-Whitley of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue in Los
Angeles.  The PUC is represented by agency attorneys Peter Arth
Jr., William N. Foley and Lawrence Q. Garcia of San Francisco.
The SoCalGas response was filed by corporate attorneys Daniel G.
Clement and Norman J. Provost.  All are located in Los Angeles.

NC COURT OF APPEALS
DENIES EASEMENT FOR
UTILITY INSTALLATION

     An easement that does not expressly permit access for
utilities cannot be judicially expanded to authorize installation
of underground utility and telephone lines, the North Carolina
Court of Appeals ruled Nov. 21 in a 2-1 decision.  Swaim v.
Simpson et al., No. COA94-1205 (NC Ct. App.).

     The majority said the easement holder is bound by the
express and limited language of the conveyance.

     Rickey Swaim was granted a recorded easement to his
residential lot for a "right of way for ingress and egress" over
a lot owned by Elmer and Joan Simpson in Yadkin County, NC.
After the Simpsons refused him permission to install underground
utility and phone lines along the easement, Swaim filed a
declaratory judgment complaint in Yadkin County District Court,
where Judge Samuel L. Osborne granted summary judgment in favor
of Swaim.

     The Court of Appeals reversed in a majority opinion by Chief
Judge Gerald Arnold.  Once an easement is established, the
easement holder cannot change the use for which it was created in
a way that increases the burden on the subservient land, said the
panel.  Allowing the location, installation and maintenance of
facilities for domestic utilities on the Simpsons' property would
increase that burden, it said, and the easement cannot be
judicially expanded.

     Dissenting, Judge Clifton E. Johnson said Swaim's
underground utilities would not encumber the Simpsons' property
or use of the easement.  He also said it is reasonable to
interpret the easement language as including the right to install
utilities to a residential lot.

     C.R. "Skip" Long Jr. of Morrow, Alexander, Tash & Long
represented the Simpsons.  N. Lawrence Hudspeth III and Douglas
P. Mayo of Shore Hudspeth & Harding appeared for Swaim.

CONSEQUENCES OF FEDERAL UTILITY DEMAND-SIDE MANAGEMENT
(DSM) LEGISLATION TO UTILITIES

This (Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories) paper
reviews some of the potential consequences of recent
federal legislation on Demand-Side Management (DSM) to
utilities.  It covers the 1992 Energy Policy Act
(EPAct), the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act, and
FERC Order No. 636.  The paper: outlines the contents
of the federal legislation regarding utility DSM
programs; explains some of the impacts of these laws
and regulations on utility programs, particularly the
likely effects with respect to the emerging competitive
utility market; and seeks to understand where and how
action will be needed to carry out many of the
provisions of these laws in the most cost-effective
manner.

Examples of specific activities regarding DSM in
Pennsylvania are included for illustration.  Each of
the federal laws under discussion is unique in terms of
origin, goals, and focus; nevertheless they all focus
on the regulated energy industries in such a way that
their effects tend to combine to force massive changes.
In the regulated electric and natural gas industries,
this synergy is compounding the complexity of
management and, at least in the short term,
contributing to increases in the cost of doing
business.  In the long term, these federal initiatives
are likely to lead to a massive reassessment of
state-regulated energy sources in production and end
use, and their environmental consequences.  The overall
effect of all three pieces of legislation is to
increase competition among the state-regulated
utilities.  The differences between competitive and
regulated industries are also noted in an effort to
explain the effect of inducing competition among energy
utilities.  This has particular relevance to
utility-sponsored energy-efficiency programs such as
DSM, and other customer-assistance activities.

UTILITY DEMAND-SIDE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS: 1989 THROUGH
1998

Over the pest five years, the Energy Information
Administration (EIA) has been collecting data annually
from U.S. electric utilities on their Demand-Side
Management (DSM) programs, both current and projected.
The latest data, presented in this (Oak Ridge National
Laboratory) report, cover activities for 1993 and
projections for 1994 and 1998.

In 1993, 991 utilities operated DSM programs and spent
$2.8 billion, a 13% increase over 1992 expenditures.
These and earlier DSM programs saved 44,000 GWh of
energy and reduced potential peak demand by 40,000 MW,
30% and 22% increases over the 1992 values,
respectively.  While some people predict the demise of
electric-utility DSM programs, the data do not paint as
bleak a picture.  In most parts of the country, DSM
programs grew in 1993, and utilities (as of Spring
1994) projected continued growth through 1998.
Expenditures grew from 1.3% of revenues in 1992 to 1.5%
in 1993, and are expected to grow 2.5% per year faster
than inflation.  Thus, DSM spending is expected to stay
constant at 1.5% of revenues through 1998.

Because of the cumulative effect of DSM programs,
energy savings are expected to grow from 1.2% of sales
in 1992 to 1.6% in 1993 and 3.0% in 1998.  Potential
peak reductions are expected to increase from 5 9% of
peak demand in 1992 to 6.8% in 1993 and 8.9% in 1998;
however this growth in spending is not as rapid as the
8% annual real growth projected a year earlier. Actual
expenditures in 1993 were 6.5% lower than projected
early that year; while energy savings were the same as
projected earlier.  Potential peak reductions were
actually 9% higher than previously projected.

IMPACT EVALUATION OF UTILITY DEMAND-SIDE MANAGEMENT
(DSM) PROGRAMS

Over the past several years, four of the largest
investor-owned California utilities have completed more
than 50 evaluation studies designed to measure the
energy and demand impacts of their Demand-Side
Management (DSM) programs.  The four utilities are:
Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), Southern California
Edison (SCE), Southern California Gas (SoCalGas), and
San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E).  These studies
cover residential, commercial, industrial, and
agricultural DSM programs and provide a wealth of
information on program impacts.

This (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) report summarizes
the results of these DSM evaluation studies in order to
describe what DSM has achieved in California.  It
assesses how well these achievements were forecast and
compares the effectiveness of the different types of
DSM programs.  It also documents the sizable
investments made by the California utilities in their
1990-1992 DSM programs.  Between 1990 and 1992, the
four utilities spent $772 million on energy-efficiency
and energy-conservation programs.  The report
summarizes the realization rates estimated by the
50+ evaluation studies.  Realization rates -- defined
as ex-post net savings estimates divided by ex-ante net
savings estimates -- are summarized for 158 programs
and program segments.

IMPACTS OF ELECTRIC UTILITY DEMAND-SIDE MANAGEMENT
(DSM) PROGRAMS ON ELECTRICITY PRICE

As competition in the electricity industry increases,
utilities (and others) worry more about the upward
pressure on electricity prices that Demand-Side
Management (DSM) programs often impose.  Because of
these concerns, several utilities have recently reduced
the scope of their DSM programs, or have focused them
more on customer service and peak-demand reductions and
less on improving energy efficiency.

This (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) study uses ORFIN
(the Oak Ridge Financial Model) to calculate the rate
impacts of DSM.  ORFIN is used to examine the two
factors that contribute to DSM's upward pressure on
prices: (1) the cost of the programs themselves; and
(2) the loss of revenue associated with fixed-cost
recovery.  The second factor reflects the reduction in
revenues caused by the DSM-induced energy and demand
savings that exceed the reduction in utility costs.

The analysis examines DSM price impacts as functions of
the following factors: (1) the DSM program itself,
including: cost; conservation load factor; geographic
focus on deferral of transmission and distribution
investments; and mix across customer classes; (2) the
utility's cost and pricing structures, which include
factors at least partly under the utility's control,
such as: retail tariffs; fixed vs. variable operating
costs; and capital costs not related to kW or kWh
growth; and (3) external economic and regulatory
factors, including: the level and temporal pattern of
avoided energy and capacity costs; rate-basing vs.
expensing of DSM-program costs; shareholder incentives
for DSM programs; load growth; and the rates for
income, property, and revenue taxes.

STUDY OF NET LOSS REVENUE ADJUSTMENTS FOR UTILITY
DEMAND-SIDE MANAGEMENT (DSM) PROGRAMS

Utility shareholders can lose money on Demand-Side
Management (DSM) investments between rate cases.
Several industry analysts argue that the revenues lost
from utility DSM programs are an important financial
disincentive to utility DSM investment.  A key utility
regulatory reform undertaken since 1989 allows
utilities to recover the lost revenues incurred through
successful operation of DSM programs.  Explicitly
defined net lost revenue adjustment (NLRA) mechanisms
are the states' preferred approach to lost-revenue
recovery from DSM programs.

This (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) report examines
the experiences that states and utilities are having
with the NLRA approach.  The report: determines whether
NLRA is a feasible and successful approach to removing
the cost-revenue disincentive to utility operation of
DSM programs; identifies the conditions linked to
successful implementation of NLRA mechanisms in
different states; assesses whether NLRA has changed
utility investment behavior; suggests improvements to
NLRA mechanisms; identifies states having NLRA
mechanisms where utilities are recovering cost revenues
from DSM programs, through interviews of regulatory
agency staffs in these states and utility staffs in
four states; analyzes regulatory agency orders
involving NLRA, as well as associated testimony,
reports, and utility lost revenue recovery filings; and
uses qualitative and quantitative indicators to assess
NLRA's effectiveness. Contrary to the concerns raised
by some industry analysts, the results indicate that
NLRA is a feasible approach to the lost-revenue
disincentive.

A SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACT MODEL FOR STUDYING THE
DEMOGRAPHIC IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE UTILITY RATE DESIGNS

Historically, utility customers have been
differentiated into various customer classes based on
their utility service demand characteristics.  This
(Argonne National Laboratory) paper argues that greater
differentiation based on value and cost of service can
be justified on grounds of economic efficiency, and if
done properly, can also promote economic equity.  Doing
this would require a break with traditional customer
classifications.  With this break, more detailed
information on how and why certain utility services are
consumed would be required.

In line with the issue of heterogeneity within the
residential customer class, is the differential impact
that different utility rates might have on different
population groups.  The paper shows how differences in
the pattern of energy use may give rise to disparate
economic impacts, depending on the rate structure, and
how more equitable and efficient outcomes might be
achieved if these differences are taken into account.
For this purpose, an analytical model has been
developed.  The Energy Policy Socioeconomic Impact
Model (EPSIM) is an econometric simulation model to
assess the economic impact of utility rate designs and
Demand-Side Management programs on various population
groups.  The paper provides a conceptual description of
the theoretical underpinnings associated with the
EPSIM.

ELECTRIC AND GAS RATES FOR RESIDENTIAL, COMMERCIAL, AND
INDUSTRIAL SECTORS IN 1994 FOR 45 U.S. CITIES

This 2-volume report (by Casazza, Schultz and
Associates) contains electric and gas rates for the
residential, commercial, and industrial sectors in
45 U.S. cities during 1994.  The rates were collected
from the utilities that serve the 45 cities involved in
the study.  These rates apply to the residential,
commercial, and industrial sectors of service and
include both general service and various innovative
rate structures.  The information compiled from the
utilities is compared to data from other sources to
ensure consistency.  Additional contacts were made with
specific utilities to resolve observed conflicts of
information.  The information is organized in several
lengthy appendixes (A, B, and C in Volume 1, and D, E,
F, and G in Volume 2) with introductory explanatory
chapters in Volume 1.  Appendixes D and E provide rate
abstracts for the South and West regions; Appendix F
provides a list of known utility rate revisions; and
Appendix G provides 1994 utility sales data.

STUDY OF THE EXTENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IN THE
PRODUCTION OF ELECTRICITY

This (Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories) study
focuses on technological change in electricity
production.  The study is based on empirical economic
research on production functions in the electric
utility industry.  It advances a seldom used approach,
called the engineering-production function, instead of
the more common neoclassical approach used by
economists.  Combined with this approach is a major
departure from the type of data used to conduct
econometric estimations of production parameters.  The
research draws upon a consistent set of ex-ante or
blueprint data that better reflects planned technical
performance and cost data elements, in contrast to the
more customary expect-type of data from actual firm
and/or plant operations.  The results from the
examination of coal-fired technologies indicate the
presence of technical change.  Using data for the
period 1979 to 1989, it finds technical change to be
capital-augmenting at the rate of 1.8% per year.

ELECTRIC UTILITIES' ROLE IN BUILDING THE NATIONAL
INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE (NII)

In two particular aspects, from a lawyer's perspective,
that are briefly investigated in this (DOE) study ,
electric utilities appear uniquely well-positioned to
contribute to the National Information Infrastructure
(NII).

One aspect concerns the legal powers that utilities
have derived from their charters and operating
authorities and confirmed in their rights-of-way, to
carry out activities and functions necessary for
delivering electric service.  These activities and
functions include building telecommunications
facilities and undertaking information services that
are essential to manage electricity demand and supply.
The economic value, to utilities and society, from the
efficiencies made possible by telecommunications and
information could be substantial.  How great remains to
be established, but by many estimates, electric utility
applications could fund a significant share of the
capital costs of building the NII.  Although utilities'
legal powers to pursue such efficiencies through
telecommunications and information appear beyond
dispute, it is likely that effort to do so will produce
substantial excess capacity.  Who will benefit from
this excess capacity is a potentially contentious
political question that demands early resolution.  Will
this windfall go to the utility, the customer, or no
one because of political paralysis, or will there be
some equitable and practical split.

A second aspect, one of inquiry, points to another
contemporary issue of very great societal importance
that could very well become the platform on which the
first question can be resolved fortuitously: how to
achieve universal telecommunications service.  In the
effort to fashion the NII that will now continue, ways
and means to maximize the unique potential contribution
of electric utilities to meet important social and
economic needs -- in particular, universal service --
merit priority attention.

concerns project considerations and design systems for
the wheeling of cogenerated power.  The term "wheeling
electric power" refers to utility transmission of power
that it doesn't own.  The term "cogeneration" refers to
simultaneous production of electric and thermal power
from an energy source that, in many instances, is more

ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC FIELD LEVELS FROM HIGH-VOLTAGE
TRANSMISSION LINES VERSUS THEIR DESIGN OPTIONS AND COST

This (Argonne National Laboratory) report provides
background information regarding electric and magnetic
fields (EMFs) of high-voltage transmission lines at
typical voltages and line configurations and typical
transmission line design-option costs, to assist with
alternatives for environmental control of field
strengths.  EMF strengths up to 200 ft from a
transmission-conductor centerline are calculated for:
an ac overhead line; a 345-kV and a 230-kV ac
underground line; and a (+ or -)450-kV dc overhead
line.  Compacting and height sensitivity factors are
computed for variation in EMFs when the line conductors
are moved closer or raised.  Estimated costs for the
lines are presented and discussed, so that the impact
of using alternative strategies for reducing EMF
strengths, and the implications of implementing the
strategies, can be better appreciated.

SUPERCONDUCTIVITY FOR ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS

This (NREL) report presents a program overview of
superconductivity for use in electric power systems.
Largely due to government and private industry
partnerships, electric power applications based upon
high-temperature superconductivity are now being
designed and tested, only 7 years after the discovery
of high-temperature superconductors.  These
applications offer many benefits to the national
electric system, including: increased energy
efficiency; reduced equipment size; reduced emissions;
increased stability/reliability; deferred expansion;
and flexible electricity dispatch/load management.  All
of these benefits have a common outcome: lower

CONCERNS REGARDING ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFICIENCY
IN COMPETITIVE POWER MARKETS

For years the electric utility industry operated as a
regulated monopoly, largely immune to market forces
except those of competing fuels.  That era came to an
end with the Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act
(PURPA) of 1974, which created a market for non-utility
generated power. Within 20 years, non-regulated
non-utility generators have become the primary supplier
of new energy resources.  Their market power is matched
by their political power, as evidenced in the Energy
Policy Act of 1994 (EPAct) that requires open access to
utility transmission lines to facilitate inter-utility
bulk power sales.

Conventional wisdom regarding this issue believes that
active wholesale power markets with competition among
alternative generators will lead to lower
power-development costs and cheaper retail power
prices.  However, the trend towards alternative bulk
power sources at low prices intersects with large
retail power customers' interests in accessing
alternative power supplies.  In many instances, these
alternatives to local utilities are at a lower cost
than retail rates.

For the most part, proponents of generation competition
have remained silent about potential environmental
consequences.  However, skeptics of increased
competition, including some major environmental groups,
cite environmental impacts among their concerns.  This
(Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories) paper deals
with energy and environmental efficiency in competitive
power markets, and examines these concerns.

ELECTRICITY REGULATION IN GERMANY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE
EUROPEAN MARKET

This translation from Germany (Oldenburg University)
concerns electricity regulation in Germany in the
context of the European Market.  It presents a survey
of the electric power regulatory thinking and situation
in Germany with respect to ongoing European Market
reform.  Electric utilities in Germany are semi-public
or private enterprises having a wide variety of size.
The large producer-utilities operate the high voltage
grid on the basis of private contracts.  Regional
distribution companies, mostly without a considerable
share in production and often in cooperation with local
distributors, deliver electricity in the non-urban
areas; whereas mostly city-owned electric utilities
supply the large cities, often with a considerable
share of electricity produced in cogeneration plants.
In the past, the equilibrium between the parts of this
system was ensured by a legal framework that protected
local monopolies, as well as by long-term contracts
between producers and distributors.  This equilibrium
derived its stability from political, more then
economic, factors.

Now, deregulation trends inherent in European Market
legislation on competition threaten this stability.  In
the first phase of this legislation, resistance against
a more competitive order seemed unanimous.  Since that
time, however, the different players have had time to
rethink their positionS.  The European Council has now
proposed a more moderate regulation, taking into
account the large differences among the different
member countries.  The German Government has made a
proposal for some important changes in the European
Market Energy Law and connected passages in the
Competition Law, which would introduce some
more-competitive elements into the system.  Wholesale
producers and regional distributors, as well as
customer groups, are in favor of this reform, whereas
the local distributors fear they will become the losers
in the ongoing reform process.  Environmentalists
express concern that a more competitive order could
lead to a lowering of environmental standards.

HOW A SMALL ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP HELPED REFORM ELECTRIC
UTILITY REGULATION

This (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) paper tells a
story about David and Goliaths; how a small
environmental group helped reform electric utility
regulation.  In 1991, the Land and Water Fund of the
Rockies (LAW Fund) -- a regional environmental
organization -- started an energy project with two
lawyers and a scientist to challenge the
energy-efficiency, renewable-resource, and
environmental-protection practices of utilities in the
vast six-state Rocky Mountain region.  Within three
years, Colorado and Utah had adopted comprehensive
Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) rules, and several
utilities had developed plans to expand their
Demand-Side Management (DSM) activities.  The paper
discusses the role that this small band of lawyers and
policy analysts played in stimulating these changes.
It also comments on the substantial influence and
valuable services that such a small group can provide.

DIRECT CONVERSION OF METHANE TO METHANOL

This (University of Colorado) report covers a program
to demonstrate the effectiveness of a catalytic
membrane reactor (a ceramic membrane combined with a
catalyst) to solely produce methanol by partial
oxidation of methane.  Methanol synthesis and
separation in one step would make methane more valuable
for producing chemicals and fuels.  Both ceramic and
metal membranes are tested, and similar results are
obtained.  A cooling tube is inserted inside the
membrane reactor to create a low-temperature zone that
rapidly quenches the product stream.  This
non-isothermal non-permselective membrane reactor has
proved effective for increasing methanol selectivity
during CH4 oxidation.

THE NET ENERGY BALANCE OF CORN ETHANOL

Studies conducted since the late 1970s have estimated
the net energy value of corn ethanol; however,
variations in the data and assumptions used among the
studies have resulted in a wide range of estimates.
This (Economic Research Service) study identifies the
factors causing this wide variation and develops a more
consistent estimate.  It concludes that the net energy
value of corn ethanol has become positive in recent
years due to technological advances in ethanol
conversion and increased efficiency in farm production.
It shows that corn ethanol is energy efficient, as
indicated by an energy ration of 1.24.

WEST AFRICAN DEEP WATER DRILLING SET TO TAKE OFF END YEAR

A new market for high specification semi-submersibles opens up in deep
water off West Africa at the end of this year.  Suitable drilling units
will need to be brought in from outside the region to cope with water
depths varying from 2,500 to over 4,000 feet.

Co-operation is likely between the operators planning to drill during
1995/6 to reduce mobilisation costs and avoid undue competition within
the small worldwide pool of suitable rigs.  This will probably limit
the number of deep water rigs required offshore Nigeria to two - one an
upgraded third generation or standard fourth generation unit operating
in intermediate water depths of around 2,500 ft, and the other a
specialist deep water rig capable of drilling in 4,000 ft or more.

There are also deep water drilling programmes planned elsewhere
offshore West Africa, notably in Angola, but also in Congo, Gabon
Equatorial Guinea and potentially Namibia.  These could provide
continuing employment for one other deep water unit. The DP drillship
Pelerin has begun to establish a foothold in this segment of the
market.

Pelerin moved from South East Asia last year to drill two deep water
wells for Elf in the Congo, although the contract was terminated after
a single well.  However, after modifications in Cape Town, Pelerin will
drill two deep water wells for Shell in Block 16 in Angola starting in
May.

The critical players in the Nigerian deep water semi market are Shell
and Statoil, the latter operating on behalf of the Statoil/BP
consortium.  Statoil and Shell are due to drill up to six wells apiece
in the period 1995 to 1997, amounting to approximately six months
drilling by each company per year.

Initially, the two operators investigated combining their programmes,
and sharing a suitable rig.  A pre-tender was issued late last year for
a semi for a one year term starting at the end of 1994, with two
further one year options. Partly as a result of this pre-tender the
incompatibility of the two programmes in terms of rig specification and
timing became clear.

Both operators require semis equipped with 15,000 psi BOP stacks for
programmes starting early in 1995.  Shell plans three wells in over
2,500 ft of water and one in over 4,000 ft.  Two of these are planned
to be drilled from the first quarter of 1995.  After a four month gap
to early 1996, a further two wells will be drilled.  Shell is then
considering two further deep water wells in 1997.  In contrast five of
six wells planned by Statoil are understood to be in around 2,500 ft of
water, while one well in deeper water is being deferred until 1997.

For its programmes in 1995 and 1996, Statoil is believed to consider an
upgraded third generation semi to be suitable, whereas Shell will need
a more specialised fourth generation deep water rig.  Having
established the mutual incompatibility of their
programmes, the two operators are now seeking alternative partners to
fill the gaps in their requirement with a single rig contract.  Shell is
talking to Esso which is planning a well in over 3,250 ft of water in
the third quarter of 1995, and could, with minor adjustment, neatly fill
the gap between Shell's 1995 and 1996 programmes.

Statoil is understood to have circulated other operators with the
results of its joint pre-tender exercise with The Norwegian state
company is expected to tender by early April for a semi to start work
at the end of 1994.  As well as attempting to set up a partnership with
one or more other operators, it is thought Statoil could base its
contract on anything from one to six firm wells plus options.

Other operators in Nigeria
Other operators planning deep water wells offshore Nigeria from the end
of 1994 have already begun their own market inquiries.  This month Agip
has sought details of availability and indicative rates for a semi for
one firm well plus two options starting between December 1994 and
February 1995 based on one of two possible scenarios.  Option A is
based on a water depth of 3,600 ft and Option B on a maximum depth of
2,650 ft.  In both cases a 15,000 psi BOP, three mud pumps and
chain/wire mooring with propulsion assist form the basis of the
requirement.  In terms of start date Agip's plans appear to clash with
both Statoil and Shell, so some compromise may need to be worked with
one or the other depending whether Agip goes for Option A or B.

Among others planning deep water wells off Nigeria, Dupont has a
location in about 2,700 ft of water, although the spud is not now
expected until late in 1995.  Elf could also drill in 1995, although it
has indicated it might be 1996 before it drills on its acreage in
permits OPL 222 and OPL 223 where the water depth ranges from 3,000 to
6,000 ft.  Mobil has yet to formulate definite plans for its deep water
Nigerian acreage, but has indicated it intends to work with other
operators to ensure it has access to a suitable rig at the appropriate
time.

Angolan deep water market
Apart from its two wells this year with the drillship Pelerin, Shell
also plans three more deep water wells in Angola Block 16 starting in
mid-1995.  While it is not yet definite that the Pelerin will be
retained for this work, Shell does have options on the rig.  Subject to
successfully concluding its initial two well programme with Shell, the
Pelerin should be well placed to win a further contract with Elf which
is planning a well in Angola Block 17 in 3,300 ft of water spudding in
August or September 1994.  Also in Angola, BP is operator on Block 15
for a consortium including Statoil and Exxon where deep water drilling
will be required, although details of the start date are not yet known.

Congo, Gabon, Namibia and Equatorial Guinea
Elsewhere in West Africa exploration is gradually moving into deeper
water off the edge of the continental shelf.  In Congo, Elf has already
drilled a deep water well in 1994 and could return in the next year or
two to drill deep water well Moho-1. This had previously been planned
for a 1994 spud.  In Gabon, British Gas could drill a well in 1995 in
around 1800 ft of water, while Shell is planning a well in similar
depths on its Kenguerie Marin permit in mid-1996.

UMIC/Mobil is understood to be planning a well in 1700 ft of water
offshore Equatorial Guinea at the end of 1994.  Some acreage in the
recently licensed Namibian offshore also includes deep water territory.
 Norsk Hydro's block is in water depths up to 6,000 ft, but although
consideration has been given to drilling a well in around 3,000 ft of
water, this prospect now appears to have been dropped in favour of
concentrating on more accessible prospects.

OFFSHORE RIG TOP DRIVE SURVEY

Use of top drives in Americas below world average.

The Gulf of Mexico lags behind the rest of the world in the fitting of
top drives or power swivels on offshore rigs.  The top end of the jack-
up market in the US Gulf is well supplied with top drives, as would be
expected in an area with so much development drilling.  This is not the
case for the lower specification units.  However, recent increased
competition, with many rigs mobilising to the area last year, should
result in a rise in the number of top drives fitted.

Experience in the North Sea has shown that while there may well be an
initial dayrate premium gained by rigs with top drive, this disappears
as top drive installation becomes a necessity in order to remain in the
market.  All the competitive jack-ups and all the marketed semi-
submersibles in the North Sea are equipped with top drive.

Just under 52 % of the competitive offshore rig fleet is now equipped
with a top drive or power swivel.  64 % of semis in the world have top
drives, largely reflecting operator preference in the North Sea, where
many semis are still based.  Only 49 % of jack-ups worldwide have top
drives, reflecting the lower percentage of rigs so equipped in the
major jack-up market, the US Gulf, and in other parts of the Americas.

In India top drives are not an ONGC requirement, so statistically there
are a below average number of top drives in the Middle East/India
region.  Top drives are, however, widely used in the Middle East Gulf,
and to a slightly lesser extent in the Gulf of Suez.

Only three drillships have top drives, just 16 % of the world fleet,
principally because drillships are mostly involved in exploratory
rather development drilling.  Of the three which are fitted, Canmar has
two, and Sonat has one on the Discoverer 534.

Rigs with a higher initial capital cost and/or of a more sophisticated
design tend to be fitted with top drive. (see table p 3)  70 % of
deeper water jack-ups and 86 semis are equipped with top drive or a power
swivel.  Many older rigs are not marketed, and upgrades are not
contemplated, so the percentage of marketed rigs with top drive or a
power swivel .  Many older rigs with top drives amongst 1st and 2nd
generation semis and shallower water jack-ups is higher than it appears
statistically.

The provision of top drives and power swivels is dominated by Varco,
which has supplied 215 or 83 % of the top drives to the offshore mobile
competitive rig fleet.  Maritime Hydraulics is having increased success,
and to date has supplied 11 % of the units to the mobile fleet.
Portable top drives have been developed
by both companies.  National Oilwell and ACB,  the market.

A comparison of the investment which drilling contractors have made in
fitting top drives to offshore rigs is interesting.  Seven of the major
contractors (managing over 80 % of their rigs equipped with top drives.
 This figure would be increased to eight., if Global Marine had not
recently purchased three 116 jack-ups which arees.  Although the Gulf
of Mexico has, on average, a lower proportion of top drives compared
with the rest of the world, several of these contractors have the bulk
of their fleet in the US Gulf.

The figures for top drives fitted by contractors is revealing about
contractor status in the largest jack-up market in the world: the US
Gulf.  Three types of controse with over 50% of their rigs equipped
with top drives: Diamond, Dual, ENSCO, Global Marine, and Rowan.  Those
that have a few of their rigs so equipped: Chiles (although that rig is
currently in West Africa,) Marine Drilling, and Noble; and those with
no top drives yet fitted: Falcon Drilling, NR Marine and Southwestern.
Competition will ensure that more top drives are bought.

Explanation of definitions used in top drive tables
The accompanying tables (in the hard copy) on pages 5 to 13, and also
on page 3, give a 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th generation description for each
semi-submersible.  Many rigs, however, have been upgraded to have some
of the characteristics of the next generation of units; the earlier
Sedco 700 series being a particular case in point.  However, some
subjective demarcatioon of a generation to a semi-submersible has been
made more on build date than on physical characteristics.

Jack-ups in India have been grouped with those in the Middle East,
whereas drillships in India have been grouped with those in Asia,
reflecting the way the market for these two types of rigs tends to
function.

NORTH SEA SEMI DEMAND TUMBLES

As expected there has been a dramatic drop in the utilisation levels of
semi-submersibles in the North Sea.  In January there were 34 semis
working in NW Europe.  This is expected to drop to 22 or 23 in the next
month.  With the large exodus out of the North Sea at the end of last
year, demand elsewhere in the world for North Sea semi-submersibles has
for the foreseeable future mostly been satisfied.  There are few
opportunities for contractors now, and lay up for most is a
probability.

For the surplus North Sea semis there may be work for one in the
Mediterranean for Repsol off Egypt, and two deepwater units will be
required in West Africa at the end of the year.  Competition for these
will be strong, with the West African deepwater tenders likely to be
bid also by contractors with rigs in the Americas.  However, of the
North Sea semis, West Delta is mobilising to the Far East for a one
well plus two options contract with Mobil Indonesia in 1,800 ft of
water.  On previously awarded contracts Dan Baroness is substituting
for Dan Countess for Unocal Trinidad, with Dan Princess now mobilising
to LASMO Vietnam, leaving the older Dan Countess stacked in UK.  The
jack-up market in NW Europe has fairly low utilisation levels
anticipated for the rest of 1994, but demand is at least expected to
stay constant.

MEDITERRANEAN MARKET POSSIBLY NOW IN BALANCE

In the Mediterranean a potential shortage of a jack-up in the area has
probably been solved by Santa Fe which plans to mobilise Key Hawaii for
a 2 well plus option contract with Samedan offshore Tunisia.  Key
Hawaii is currently working for Mobil Nigeria, but NNPC payment
problems have made it difficult for Mobil to confirm a definite
extension of a proposed contract.

There are longer term tenders in the Mediterranean area, notably with
TPAO in the Sea of Marmara and Agip Italy where the results are as yet
undetermined.  Sonny Voss is a candidate for mobilising through the
Suez Canal, if the rig is awarded work in the Mediterranean.  INA's
jack-up Labin, based in the Mediterranean, was refused work in Tunisia
at the turn of the year as a protest against political events in former
Yugoslavia.  Whether this will extend to other Muslim countries remains
to be seen, but in such a small market, currently just nine jackups,
this could be of importance.

The award of QGPC's term programme off Qatar will affect rig contracts
in the Gulf of Suez, and possibly the Mediterranean.  QGPC tenders were
lodged at the end of December, and the operator is nearing a decision,
but has not yet awarded the work.  Santa Fe has offered a rig to QGPC,
and is apparently in competition with Maersk for the contract.  If
Santa Fe is successful it will have to mobilise a rig from outside the
Arabian Gulf, probably from the Gulf of Suez or Singapore.

GULF OF MEXICO JACK-UP MARKET FUTURE UNCLEAR

The Gulf of Mexico jack-up market, apart from the Far East and West
African floater markets, now remains the only one in the world where
utilisation in 1994 might be reasonable.  As current natural gas prices
are still well over the $2/mmbtu level, as are the futures prices, the
prognosis is good.  Confidence has not fully returned to the market
after the optimism shown at the end of 1993 before the oil price drop.
Plans being formulated at the moment by many of the operators will be
critical for the market.  A survey of operators' intentions was
intended earlier in the year for this issue of World Rig Forecast, but
in the event, many plans were not firm enough to make a comprehensive
survey worth publishing.

With the large number of mobilisations into the Gulf of Mexico in 1993,
and the heavy refurbishment programme of previously stacked units,
there must remain a doubt about utilisation levels of jack-ups in 1994.
 The top end of the market is showing continuing strength with high
specification units being extended at end 1993 rates.  Those wishing to
re-enter the market after lay-up are having to cut rates.

CHRISTOPHER CREEK, SONOMA COUNTY--LARRY WALKER LIKES THEIR TWO REDS;
CO-OWNER SUSAN MITCHELL SUGGESTS FOOD PAIRINGS;  THEIR CHARDONNAY,
WHICH WALKER ALSO LIKES, IS AVAILABLE ONLY AT WINERY: 707/433-2001

  If Rhone-style wines go out of favor in the USA, most producers of
syrah, mourvedre, carignane and the like can go back to blending those
rich wines into their other reds.

  But tiny Christopher Creek Winery, just south of Healdsburg, has bet
the farm they bought almost ten years ago on petite sirah and the true
Rhone, syrah, both of which win them numerous medals and much praise.
Except for an acre or so of chardonnay, which is distributed mostly from
the winery, their land is devoted to the two reds.

  Larry Walker recently tasted the wines and recorded co-owner Susan
Mitchell's food suggestions, in the California Visitors Review, a great
weekly magazine, $40 per year from PO Box 92, El Verano, CA 95433, tel.
707/938-3494, fax 938-3674 (they don't have e-mail yet, I guess).

    -- The 1991 syrah, $14, brought forth from Walker's quill "lush;
rich;  dark velvety fruit;  full;  layered."  Susan Mitchell, mother of
the teen-age Christopher for whom the winery is named, says hearty
cassoulet is a great match.

    -- The 1992 syrah, also $14, is big and powerful, Walker says-- but
because of tasty fruit, there's a certain graceful quality about it as
well.  So Ms. Mitchell suggests "a chicken and turkey meatloaf with
garlic mashed potatoes and a green salad."

    -- The 1992 petite sirah runs true to its varietal character --
deeply intense, lots of flavor including a full-flavored finish, and
what Walker calls "meaty tannins" which must mean you can pair it with
some hard-knuckled, hot-tempered foods:  sure enough, here's Ms.
Mitchell suggesting pepperoni pizza!  Maybe next year it'll be perfect
with the grilled steak, prime rib or roast pork loin she also mentioned.

    -- There's a 1994 chardonnay whose oak makes its statement from
"behind" a citrus character.  The wine is "elegant, stylish, poised and
balanced," says Walker, mentioning a winery price of $16.  Food?
Grilled chicken or light pasta dishes.

  If you contact Christopher Creek, ask for their recipes matched to
their wines.  Here's one.

SUSAN'S WINTER POTATO SOUP

      1/4 cup olive oil
        1 medium yellow onion, chopped
        4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
    2-1/2 lbs Yukon gold or red potatoes
        3 cups chicken stock
    Also, freshly-ground pepper and salt to taste
      and sun-dried tomatoes, finely chopped, or fresh Italian parsley,
            finely chopped.

  Saute onions and garlic one to two minutes in heated oil.  Use a
large, heavy pan.  Don't peel potatoes, but wash and cube them and add
them, with the chicken stock, to the pan;  add water as necessary to
cover the potatoes.  Simmer over heat until potatoes are tender, about
20 minutes.  You can serve from the pot, or puree after allowing the
soup to cool a bit.  Use the tomatoes or parsley as garnish atop each
bowl, and accompany it with warm crusty bread and syrah.

'SONOMA ODYSSEY' JUNE 1, 1996--WORTH A VISIT

  Perfectly in tune with the high quality of Sonoma County food and
wine, the gorgeous, even breathtaking scenery, and laid-back exurban
lifestyle of Sonoma County is its off-the-beaten-track (but not far)
Sonoma Odyssey, June 1, 1996.

  From 1 to 5 PM, at Richard's Grove--Saralee's Vineyard, you can meet
food and wine authors, taste premium wines from 30 producers, sample
Mediterranean style foods (Sonoma County is a dead ringer for Tuscany
and a number of other "mid-earth" ambiances), buy new, used and rare
books, and participate in an auction the nature of which-- who knows?

  To get there you go north from Santa Rosa to the River Road exit of US
Highway 101 (the Luther Burbank Center for the Performing Arts dominates
the view here;  you can't miss it) and go west on River Road to Slusser
Road and turn north to number 3375.

  Tickets are $20.  Information from co-sponsor the Sonoma County Wine
Library, PO Box 43, Healdsburg, CA 95448, tel. 707/433-2485.  The other
sponsors are National Public Radio state KRCB-FM and PBS KRCB-TV,

MURPHY-GOODE 1993 SONOMA COUNTY FUME BLANC-- DON'T RUSH OUT TO GET IT
BECAUSE IT'S SOLD OUT, BUT THEIR 1995, $10.50 IS WIDELY AVAILABLE

  The Airport Club, the health facility where our family spends time and
money (too bad the effects don't show on me), has been serving a 1993
Murphy-Goode fume (sauvignon) blanc that's so good I've wanted to write
about it.  I thought I'd wait for their 1995 to show up on the market,
and taste them side by side.  Not really possible.  But a certain house
style will connect the two, I think, and so I'll tell you the 1995 is
available, list price $10.50, and give you the winery phone number, and
let you know what I think you might want to prepare to go with it.

  The '93 probably has just a hint of residual sugar;  I can just about
detect it and my "threshold" is 0.03 percent.  Alcohol is 13 percent and
in a white wine that level in a crisp wine can make it "hot" but I felt
no such effect.

  Delightful lemon and grapefruit with a background hint of tropical
fruit (typical for the Alexander Valley) come through in a wine that's
crisp from start to lemon-zesty finish.  It's so clean it would be
perfect with any dish with a rich white sauce -- perhaps fettucine so
sauced, with seared and braised tuna slices or chunks?  To prepare that
fresh tuna steak, I'd sear it on a bed of course-ground black pepper,
remove it from the hot iron pan, reduce the heat to medium high and
braise it over lemon slices with enough of the fume blanc to come half-
way up the height of the tuna flake;  remove from the pan when it seems
the tuna will just barely begin to flake, and slice or cube it.

  Alternatively you could make a lemon-garlic creamy white sauce (I use
Knudsen non-dairy sour creme for that).

WARNERVISION ANNOUNCES BUYOUT PLANS

     As expected, WarnerVision Entertainment Pres. Stuart Hersch
will participate in buying company he founded as A*Vision
Entertainment in 1990.  Company announced agreement in principle
for Hong Kong-based Tiger Eye Investments Holdings to buy it from
Warner Music Group.  Deal is expected to close early this year.

     Executives couldn't be reached for comment over holiday
season, when WarnerVision was among many industry-related companies
taking week off.  However, news of Hersch's plans had been expected
for several months.  Fate of WarnerVision and Hersch had been in
question since executive shakeup began at Warner Music Group
earlier last year.  Sources had posed various scenarios -- Hersch
leaving company altogether or leaving Warner Music but taking
WarnerVision with him, as is occurring (VW Nov 6 p6).

     Although ownership is changing, WarnerVision won't sever its
distribution ties with Warner Music -- it has 4-year deal to be
distributed by WEA, sources say.  Name will be changed, though --
WarnerVision name, adopted less than year ago (VW Jan 16 p5), is
likely to revert to A*Vision, name with which company was founded
as affiliate of Warner's Atlantic Records.

     Price Tiger Eye will pay for WarnerVision is in $50-$70
million range, sources said.  Gross sales of WarnerVision, known
for its aggressive stance in acquiring nontheatrical properties,
are believed to be in $120-million range.  It has major share of
fitness video market and owns leading direct response fitness
equipment distribution company Fitness Quest, which it acquired in
1994.  It also distributes children's, music and other special
interest videos along with some direct-to-video movies.

     Tiger Eye Pres.-CEO Robert Book will become chmn. of new
company.  Tiger Eye specializes in acquiring media, publishing and
entertainment companies.  Hersch is expected to continue to run
WarnerVision.  Before founding it he was COO of King World
Productions, serving as key figure in taking company public.

     Time Warner won't lose much by selling WarnerVision, which it
still will distribute.  Although losing ownership of one video
company, Time Warner will gain others if pending merger with Turner
goes through.  Time Warner owns Warner Home Video and HBO Video
along with direct response specialist Time Life;  it will gain
Turner Home Entertainment and New Line.  

     Sale of WarnerVision comes after months of turmoil in
executive ranks of Warner Music Group that most recently resulted
in resignation of Michael Fuchs (VW Nov 20 p7).  Earlier ousters at
Warner Music included Doug Morris, who originally set Hersch up at
Atlantic and now is at MCA -- one of possible future homes that had
been rumored for WarnerVision.

LARGE VIDEO CHAINS GETTING BIGGER PIECE OF PIE

     Stores making up top 100 video chains now represent more than
25% of the more than 28,000 video specialty outlets in U.S.,
according to annual Top 100 report in Video Store Magazine.  Total
number of stores among top 100 chains for 1995 was 7,220 -- 24%
increase over 1994.  However, total revenue for top 100 amounted to
$4.06 billion, only 3% increase over $3.95 billion in 1994.

     Consolidation was main reason for increase in number of
stores, report said.  Acquisition-hungry newly public chains
swallowed many smaller chains that had made Top 100 in past,
leaving room for 24 chains to make list for first time.  Top 20
chains earned $3.65 billion -- up $15 million in year.  Increase
came despite overall decline in video rental business, which Video
Store documents as down 6% for retailers on industrywide basis from
1994.

     However, average Top 100 store grossed only $568,000 in 1995
-- off 16% from $679,000 in 1994.  Drop followed 3 consecutive
years of advances.  Report said decline is "more a result of the
swelling ranks of Top 100 retailers than anything else."  Increase
in total stores of 24% was far greater than any in history of
report since 1987.  Commenting on overall revenue gain of only 3%
for Top 100 chains, report said that "as chains grow, it takes a
while for new stores to come up to speed."

     Video revenue inched up 2% for Top 100 and ancillary revenue
5%, indicating growing importance of such products as snacks,
audiobooks, CD-ROMs, videogames, music, magazines, licensed
merchandise.  Biggest ancillary category, videogames, accounted for
9.8% of average Top 100 store's revenue -- up 4% despite overall
slump in 16-bit market.  Videogame rentals accounted for 8.3%,
sales 1.5%.  Sales and rentals of laserdiscs and CD-ROMs went up
slightly to 0.9% each from 0.8%;  food and drink sales were down
slightly to 0.7% from 0.8%.

     Percentage of average Top 100 store's revenue earned from
videocassette rentals actually increased slightly to 77% from 76.3% 
after several years of decline.  Only 8.3% of average Top 100
store's revenue came from video sellthrough, and almost half of
that was from previously viewed cassettes.  Total was down 10% from
preceding year's 9.3%.

     Blockbuster continued to dominate Top 100, although its power
was slightly diluted because of challenges from newly public
competitors and chains hoping to go public soon.  Blockbuster's
share of Top 100 revenue amounted to 62% in 1995, down from 67% in
1994, and its gross revenues for 1995 were $2.6 billion.  Company
had 3,350 domestic locations at year-end.

     Hollywood Video, which went public in 1993, exploded to 280
stores in 1995 from 97, increasing revenues to $165 million from
$73 million.  Movie Gallery, which made initial public offering
(IPO) in Aug. 1994, grew to 665 stores in 1995 including 90
franchisees, from 279, increasing revenue to almost $200 million
from $90 million.  Video Update, whose IPO was in July 1994, rose
to 250 stores from 45, growing revenue to $82.5 million from $26.9
million.  Moovies, only chain to complete IPO in 1995
(Aug.),expanded to 107 stores  from 11, with revenue soaring to $49
million from $5.5 million.

     Home Vision, which filed registration statement for IPO in
Oct. that has yet to hit market, increased its store count to 53
from 38 during year, with growing to $25.5 million from $18.8
million.  West Coast Entertainment, franchiser that was purchased
by smaller Giant Video in 1995, had about 500 franchised locations
throughout year, with revenues increasing to $195 million from
$183.6 million, report said, and plans IPO early this year. 
Roadrunner Video, which became public by merging with shell company
Business Data Group in July, maintained 53 stores throughout year
with annual revenues of $22 million.  First National Entertainment,
public company that originated as film distributor, purchased
25-store Video Tyme of Las Vegas, with annual revenue of $13.1
million.

     Top 10 chains accounted for 84.8% of Top 100 revenue -- $3.44
billion.  Preceding year's top 10 accounted for 83.2% of total.  Of
entire video specialty business, top 10 chains drew 39% of income,
up from 34% in 1994.  Top 10, ranked by 1995 gross revenue, were
(1) Blockbuster, (2) West Coast, (3) Hollywood, (4) Movie Gallery,
(5) Tower Records/Video, (6) Video Update, (7) Moovies, (8) Video
Connection (recently sold to Movie Gallery), (9) Palmer Video
(expected to be sold to West Coast), (10) Home Vision.

     Chain with most revenue per store was tiny 2-store Odyssey
Video of L.A. -- No. 82 on Top 100 list, its locations had average
rental revenue of $1.45 million.  Blockbuster Video stores averaged
highest amount of rental income -- $645,900 per store, down from
$826,300 in 1994.  Chain with highest sellthrough revenue per store
was RKO Warner Video, which ironically was forced into liquidation
at year-end despite almost doubling sellthrough income to $241,500
per store from $143,182 in 1994 (see separate item in this issue). 
Average Top 100 store earned only $37,776 from sellthrough in 1995.

     Lion's share of consumer dollars spent on video sellthrough
isn't claimed by video specialists.  Video Store puts total
industry retail revenue at $14.5 billion for 1995, $8.3 billion of
it spent in video specialty stores ($7.6 billion rental and only
$690 million sellthrough).  That leaves whopping $6.2 billion spent
in nonspecialty outlets, most of them sellthrough-oriented.  Top 10
stores of any type carrying video in N. America in 1995, according
to report:  (1) Blockbuster, (2) Suncoast Motion Picture Co. (410
stores, $280 million in video revenue), (3) Wal-Mart (2,189 stores,
$271 million in video revenue), (4) K mart (2,163 stores, $249
million), (5) merged Price Club/Costco (242 stores, $173 million),
(6) West Coast Video, (7) Wherehouse Entertainment (327 stores,
$155 million), (8) Sam's Club (433 stores, $141 million), (9)
Musicland/Sam Goody (869 stores, $139 million), (10) Hollywood
Video.

NOV. VCR SALES HIT RECORD, CENSUS TOPS 150 MILLION

     Our running count of VCR sales since inception in 1975 shows
cumulative total U.S. sales hit 150 million in Nov. after just over
20 years on market.  In other Nov. hardware news, EIA figures show
dealers' purchases of VCR and several other consumer electronics
products set records for month despite less-than-enthusiastic
estimates of holiday sales potential.

     TV/VCR combo sales showed biggest advance of all -- 49.1% --
but fell shy of record for month because of huge combo sales in
Nov. 1993.  VCR decks, achieving record, were up 23.5%.  VCR census
passed 150 million unit mark in 4th week of Nov., reaching
150,039,297 (VW Dec 11 p8).

     Here's how 1995 probably will go down in record books, based
on seasonal rates for first 11 months:  Direct-view color
(excluding combos), 23.56 million, down 4.8% from last year's
record 24.71 million.  Projection TV, 828,700, big 30.3% gain over
1994's record 636,177.  TV/VCR, 2,190,000, record 8.5% more than
1994's 2.02 million.  VCR decks, record at 13.71 million, 4.7% over
13.09 million last year.  Camcorders, 3.66 million, topping 1994
record of 3.21 million by 14%.

     Following is table of EIA figures on sales to dealers for
Nov.:

16-BIT VIDEOGAMES HOLD SHARE AMID NEW FORMAT BATTLES

     "Old-fashioned" 16-bit videogame systems probably will hold
onto major market share even this year as manufacturers wage war of
words, games and marketing dollars over high-powered new
technology.

     Sparking latest contretemps were comments by 3DO Chmn. William
(Trip) Hawkins that internal "bus" structure of Nintendo Ultra 64
would severely limit performance of system overall, and was like
"squeezing a fire hose into a garden hose."

     "That's bull," said Nintendo of America Sales & Mktg. Exec. Vp
Peter Main.  At issue is ability of Nintendo's system to move
information from one part of machine to another.  Some portions of
Nintendo's machine use 32-bit bus structure.  Hawkins says that
will limit system's performance, Main and Nintendo engineers say
absolutely not.  What's clear is that such battles definitely will
wind up dominating media coverage and high-end game scene -- but
perhaps not dollar volume.

     Introduction of Ultra 64 in Japan is absolute lock for April
21, Main said.  Picture in U.S. is far fuzzier, with potential
launch dates ranging from May to Aug.  Some observers are betting
on spring launch themed on Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in
L.A.  If that's to be case, Nintendo is going to have to do some
fast advertising footwork.  In visit last week to Nintendo's
Redmond, Wash., hq, company told our affiliated publication
Consumer Multimedia Report that no ads had been placed in game fan
periodicals, even though deadlines are drawing near.  Another sign
that Ultra may come later rather than sooner:  Despite flying
half-dozen journalists to Redmond, Nintendo had only Ultra 64
videotape to show, not game itself.

     One thing is sure:  1995 was tough year for videogame
industry, Nintendo included.  "This year was called the great year
of confusion," Main said.  One big challenge:  Primary audience --
8-12-year-old boys -- is getting more choosy than ever before,
willing to skip products that don't offer dramatic edge in
performance and game play.  "We're dealing with 8-12-year-olds
acting like 35-40-year-olds in terms of savvy," he said.  That's
resulted in good and bad news for Nintendo -- software sales have
been strong, but company's new hardware introduction, Virtual Boy,
is struggling so hard that company is planning "relaunch" in both
U.S. and Japan.

     "It was the year of hits, not bits," Main said, with winner
determined by "who is going to have the greatest content."  He
pointed to Nintendo's Donkey Kong Country 2 as both hit and good
software product.  "Even while other software is selling at best
60-70% of last year's totals, this one has worldwide demand of
110-120%," he said.  One sign that strength of 16-bit market caught
Nintendo as well as most of rest of videogame market by surprise is
fact that DKC2 is sold out on global basis.  Main predicted 16-bit
strength would continue to lesser degree through 1996.  "At this
time next year [16-bit] is going to represent 35-40% of the
videogame market," he said.

     While Donkey Kong may be doing well, rest of videogame market
isn't setting any records.  Projections were that game market would
be down anywhere from 5-6% to 20%, Main said.  He thinks total
decline will come to 10-12%, with U.S. videogame dollar volume at
$3.8-$3.9 million.  Once counted out, 16-bit products represent 2/3
of that, he said.  Market share of 16-bit games declined to 66% of
total sales in 1995 to 77% in 1994.  Hand-held market share also
slumped, to 15-16% from 25%.  That still represents some
significant volume, though.  "We've got 19 million Game Boys sold,"
Main said.  "This year we'll be moving 5.7 million pieces."

     New technology, including 32-bit games and Virtual Boy,
account for only fraction of total market, about 19%, Main said. 
He estimated that fewer than one million units of 32-bit consoles
sold.  Of that number, Sony's Playstation accounted for
400,000-500,000, Sega's Saturn for 200,000 and 3DO for 150,000,
with Atari's Jaguar and other devices accounting for rest.  By
contrast, 16-bit Super Nintendo Entertainment system sold 2.4
million units, he said.  Virtual Boy's sales were far under
expectations, Main admitted.  "It's been a long year for Virtual
Boy in the U.S."  Even though 3D game playing units have sold far
under expectations, "we are not finished with Virtual Boy," he
said.

     Nintendo has sold 400,000 Virtual Boys in U.S. and 250,000 in
Japan, Main said.  Games released for unit just scratch surface of
its unique capabilities, he said.  In Japan, "they are planning to
relaunch the product in February," he said, with similar relaunch
set for U.S.  "It has not seen its full potential.  It is going to
have another round."

     One area Nintendo isn't planning to explore is CD-ROM games. 
Cost structures in CD-ROM market benefit manufacturers, not
consumers, Main said.  When it comes to adding bulk memory capacity
to Ultra 64, Nintendo is going to stick with recordable magnetic
disc that company already has announced, he said.  Disc will move
at 8 times CD-ROM speed.  Position may leave Nintendo vulnerable
when DVD hits market, since competing M-2 and Sony PlayStation
systems reportedly will be able to play back DVD discs with
relatively simple upgrade.  Signs are that Ultra 64, with its
proprietary magnetic discs, won't have that capability.

     Rental prebook record was shattered twice in 1995.  Fox last

     Rental prebook record was shattered twice in 1995.  Fox last
month reported orders of 735,000 copies of Die Hard with a
Vengeance in N. America, including revenue sharing and not
including laserdisc and direct mail.  Film released on video Dec.
19 grossed $100 million at box office.  Buena Vista earlier
reported 715,000-piece order for Pulp Fiction, highest total since
LIVE released Terminator 2 (VW Sept 4 p5).  Both Die Hard 3 and
Pulp Fiction prebooked during period when retailers overall were
experiencing downturn in rental business.  Record numbers reflect
fact that video business is becoming increasingly hit-driven, with
top titles dominating while other categories suffer.  Figures also
attest to growing importance of revenue sharing, with Rentrak now
servicing many top chains;  both Fox and Buena Vista, which have
contracts with Rentrak, are benefiting from increased orders for
their titles from Rentrak by settling for less money upfront while
awaiting share of retailers' income from rentals.

     Buena Vista's sellthrough lineup for first 6 months of 1996
could be its strongest ever for first half thanks to March 6
release of Pocahontas, March 27 release of The Many Adventures of
Winnie the Pooh (previously released only at rental early in
industry's history), and April 24 direct-to-sellthrough debut of
animated classic The Aristocats.  Last-named, just announced, will
be backed by tie-in with General Mills, which will offer $5 rebate
with Big G cereal purchase.  Disney will offer own $5 rebate on
$26.99 title with purchase of another video.  Film was released
theatrically 3 times, first in 1970;  children have been awaiting
its video debut since trailer appeared on The Lion King.  On rental
side, Buena Vista also plans big first half.  Its "Thriller Picks
in '96" program features 3 thrillers, The Prophecy (March 12), The
Tie That Binds (March 19), The Innocent (April 9).  Titles will be
marketed together on 3-sided standee, with oversized consumer
postcards along with theatrical size posters and cross-trailering. 
Company also will release Operation Dumbo Drop to rental market
March 19.  Family film that grossed $25 million theatrically will
be supported by radio promotions and POP including mobile.  Also,
Miramax Home Entertainment's March 12 rental release Muriel's
Wedding will be supported by Caribbean trip sweepstakes for
consumers in which retailer where winning consumer entered wins
vacation too.  Company is standing behind film's rentability with
rental guarantee buyback program offering $15 per tape May 13-June
13 for any tape bought in 3-unit prepacks.

     Rentrak signed long-term revenue-sharing deal with First
National Entertainment, company that recently acquired 25-store
Video Tyme of Las Vegas.  Rentrak will boost its stake in company
as part of deal, agreeing to purchase additional 357,143 shares --
it currently holds less than 5% of company.  In other news, Rentrak
said it's discontinuing most of its computer software business
development because of slow rate of return.  It took
$200,000-charge in its fiscal 2nd quarter to reflect decision.  It
now will focus on core pay-per-transaction and retailing
businesses.

     Commenting on 3M's leaving videotape manufacturing business,
TDK Mktg. Vp Tim Sullivan warned retailers to beware of
"nonmanufacturing tape suppliers who will seize the opportunity to
build market share by cutting prices."  Buying from such suppliers
could be "penny wise and pound foolish," he said, because 3M's
departure could create supply shortage, leaving those suppliers
with inadequate quantities.  With demand high for blank and pancake
tape, "suppliers who lack the capacity to manufacture their own
product will not be able to service their retail customers with
sufficient quantities of tape," Sullivan said.

SLANTS AND TRENDS


SUPERFUND HIT-The toxic-waste cleanup program joins the rest
of EPA in the federal budget-morass shutdown today when
Superfund's tax-and-spend authority expires. Officials say
this means furloughing about 2,500 agency employees who
oversee contractor activities at waste sites. The employees
were able to continue working beyond the Dec. 18 government
shutdown because Superfund's operating authority is separate
from the rest of the agency. This authority ends today, and
officials say that without the site supervisors, "we're
going to have to shut down the program nationwide"-except
for emergencies. The waste cleanup trust fund does not lack
money, only the congressional go-ahead to spend it.

A LITTLE LATE?-First, EPA gives in to state opposition and
drops its unpopular test-only requirement for vehicle-
emission inspection and maintenance stations. Next, Congress
takes steps to ensure that test-only mandates remain on the
regulatory shelf. Finally, with the barn door wide open, the
Association of Vehicle Inspection Companies was formed in
Washington last month by the firms that operate test-only
facilities under state contracts. Its rear-guard mission:
"to provide sound information to help educate the public,
state officials, political leaders and others on the
significant benefits of test-only contractor-operated
vehicle inspection programs."

EMPLOYERS OFF THE HOOK-Another mobile-source pollution-
prevention program headed for the discard bin when President
Clinton signed legislation Dec. 23 repealing the Clean Air
Act mandate for employers in polluted areas to adopt plans
to reduce commuting by employees. The Mobility Coalition for
Clean Air, the ad hoc group that lobbied for the repeal,
said it expects most states to abandon mandatory trip-
reduction requirements.

THE CHLORINE FACTOR-Findings by resear-chers at Queen's
University in Canada could have a bearing on U.S. EPA's
ongoing evaluation of drinking water disinfectants and
disinfection byproducts. The researchers report that from 10
percent to 13 percent of bladder or colon cancer cases in
Ontario may be caused by long-term drinking of and bathing
in surface water treated with chlorine. Professor Will King
said people with a 35-year exposure to chlorinated
byproducts have a 60 percent risk of bladder cancer than
people with little or no exposure. "We think the results are
important, but we don't think they mean stop using
chlorination. It's still much safer to use chlorinated water
than to use untreated water."

WHAT'S HOT IN MINNESOTA?-In a year-end review of its top
environmental issues of 1995, the state Pollution Control
Agency listed "the curious discovery of numerous deformed
frogs" in wetlands in southern Minnesota last August.
Officials are still seeking answers for the frogs' missing
legs.

PROCESS BORROWED FROM THE COLD WAR
VALUABLE ALLY FOR WASTEWATER PLANTS


   A process borrowed from U.S. and Russian Cold War
technology may perform a wide array of valuable functions
for wastewater treatment plant operators, according to
Scientific Utilization Inc. (SUI).

   In pilot studies, the pulse power process increased the
rate of anaerobic digestion in treatment units, the Decatur,
Ala., company reports. It also can boost methane production,
lower the volume of solids and neutralize cryptosporidium,
SUI says.

   Using pulse power, plant operators may be able to double
anaerobic digestion of sewage sludges, SUI says. This can
help boost methane production to power blowers, generators,
heaters and other devices in treatment plants, according to
SUI.

   The technique works by subjecting sludge to high-energy
electric arcs as it enters a plant's digesters. The arcs
rupture the cell walls of aerobic bacteria, making their
nutrients immediately available to anaerobic bacteria and
reducing the time it takes anaerobic organisms to consume
aerobic microbes and cut solids volume.

   Pulse power also may help turn sewage effluent into
potable water, according to the company. When used with
ozone and oxygen generation, the system has been shown to
render cryptosporidium non-infectious. For more information,

EPA AUDIT POLICY PROVIDES LENIENCY
BUT GRANTS NO 'PRIVILEGE' TO RESULTS


   Companies that report self-discovered environmental
violations within 10 days and act to correct them will be
eligible for reduced penalties or waivers of civil
violations and no criminal sanctions under EPA's final
policy on environmental audits.

   The policy (Federal Register, Dec. 22, 1995, p. 66706)
does not apply to violations that harm human health and the
environment. EPA said it had been studying the issue of
self-audits for 18 months and that the policy is "the
optimum way to encourage voluntary self-policing while
preserving fair and effective enforcement."

Will Override State Laws

   Under the approach, EPA retains its power to levy fines
that equal any economic gain created by the violation in
order to "preserve a level playing field." EPA also will
override state laws shielding results of corporate self-
audits from enforcement if the violations threaten public
health or the environment. At the same time, the agency said
"where a state has obtained appropriate sanctions needed to
deter such misconduct, there is no need for EPA action."

   The final policy is basically the same as an interim
policy released last March. The earlier statement applied
only to self-audits, while the final statement covers other
self-discovery steps such as due diligence. EPA defines due
diligence as systemic efforts to prevent, detect and correct
violations.

EPA Restates 'No Privilege'

   EPA will continue its policy of not routinely requesting
the results of corporate self-audits, although the agency
reiterated its position that environmental self-audits and
related corporate self-discovery activities are not
privileged information protected from public disclosure.
This contrasts sharply with an increasing number of state
laws that provide varying degrees of privilege for audit
results.

   EPA will reduce gravity-based civil penalties-those based
on the severity of the pollution problem and not on the
economic gains a company realizes-by up 75 percent. In some
cases they could be waived. To be eligible for reduced or no
civil penalties provisions of the policy, EPA said companies
must meet these conditions:

Violations must be discovered through a company's self-
audits or due-diligence process.

Violations must have been discovered voluntarily and not as
part of an EPA- or court-mandated monitoring, and the
violations must be reported promptly in writing to EPA.

Discovery of a violation cannot be based on any third-party
action such as a citizen suit or local government
investigation.

The violation must be corrected as soon as possible, and any
environmental damage must be mitigated.

The company must take steps to prevent any reoccurrence of
the violation.

Leniency is not available to repeat offenders. Repeated
offenses are defined as "the same or closely-related
violation...[occurring] previously within the past three
years at the same facility or...part of a pattern of
violations on the regulated entities' part over the past
five years."

Not eligible are violations that led to substantial
environmental harm or presented an imminent and substantial
danger to public health or which violated the terms of a
court order.

A company must cooperate with EPA and provide data that
could reveal related violations.

   Copies of the seven-page policy statement signed by
Steven Herman, assistant agency administrator for
enforcement and compliance are available from BPI's %
DocuDial Service as Doc. #03-1103.

ASME: CHLORINE LEVELS OF FEEDSTOCKS
HAVE SCANT ROLE IN DIOXIN EMISSIONS


   The chlorine content of combustor or incinerator
feedstocks has little or no effect on the composition or
quantity of dioxin emissions, the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers and other participants found in a study
of various combustion facilities.

   The conclusion contradicts arguments by public interest
groups that there is a direct relationship between chlorine
and dioxin emissions. The groups have advocated regulations
restricting the amount and type of chlorinated waste that
can be combusted in various types of combustion systems.

   The study was conducted on municipal waste combustors,
medical and hazardous waste incinerators, waste-fired
boilers, cement kilns and biomass combustors at 169
facilities. More than 1,900 test results were analyzed for
The Relationship Between Chlorine in Waste Streams and
Dioxin Emissions from Waste Combustor Stacks.

   Researchers say they found no statistically significant
relationship between chlorine input and dioxin emissions in
gas streams at 80 percent of the facilities. Ten facilities
showed higher dioxin/furan levels consistent with increases
in chlorine input, but eight other facilities showed a
decrease in dioxin/furan emissions, the study says.

   "The failure to find simultaneous increases in most
cases-and finding a few inverse relationships-indicates that
whatever effect waste feed chlorine has on [dioxin]
concentrations in combustor flue gases, it is smaller than
the influence of other cau-sative factors," ASME said in a
statement. "Any effect chlorine has on...concentrations in
commercial-scale systems is a factor of air pollution-
control system temperature, ash chemistry, combustion
conditions, imprecise measurement and localized flow
stratification."

   Besides ASME, other participants in the study included
the Vinyl Institute, the Chlorine Chemistry Council and
Environment Canada. For a copy of the study, contact ASME at
(800) 843-2763.

UPCOMING NSR RULE TO GIVE FLEXIBILITY
TO STATES IN MAKING BACT DECISIONS


   Proposed new source review (NSR) rules to be announced
soon by EPA will recommend a "top-down" approach for
determining best available control technology (BACT), but
they will give states some flexibility in determining what
method to use.

   The proposal will allow states to develop their own BACT
determination criteria so long as they take into account the
top technologies available. Under the plan, states will be
given a set of minimum criteria they must use in developing
methods for making BACT determinations.

   Dennis Crumpler, head of the NSR section of EPA's air
quality planning & standards office, told EW the government
shutdown and furlough affecting EPA would delay the schedule
to reform NSR.

   BACT is an emission limitation based on the maximum
degree of emission reduction achievable through application
of production processes, available methods, systems and
techniques. Crumpler said the rule will propose using a top-
down approach to identify BACT technology.

   New emissions sources located in areas that are in
attainment with ambient air quality standards are required
to install BACT under "prevention of significant
deterioration" requirements. BACT is determined on a case-
by-case basis for each source required to install it.

   Under the top-down method, available control options are
ranked by effectiveness for the pollutant under review.
Initially, the most stringent option is regarded as the
BACT, but source-specific energy, environmental, or economic
considerations may alter the initial determination. States
are given the discretion to determine what is the BACT for
the sources they regulate, but EPA adds two core conditions
to the state's deliberations.

   First, a source must consider all available controls in
making a BACT determination, especially the most stringent
control. Second, the draft rule will say, "the selection of
a particular control system as BACT must be justified in
terms of the statutory criteria and supported by the record,
and must explain the basis for the rejection of the other
more stringent candidate control systems."

OCCIDENTAL TO PAY U.S. $129M TO SETTLE
LANDMARK LOVE-CANAL POLLUTION CASE


   Ending a landmark case that provided the impetus for the
Superfund program, Occidental Chemical Corp. has agreed to
pay $129 million to cover costs associated with the massive
pollution of Love Canal. The settlement announced by the
Justice Department ends a 16-year-old cost-recovery case
that began after a toxic-waste nightmare forced abandonment
of more than 1,000 homes near Niagara Falls.

   The proposed settlement "should send a message of federal
persistence and tenacity," Attorney General Janet Reno said
Dec. 21. She said the government will recoup all of the $101
million it spent on the cleanup, plus $28 million in
interest.

   EPA's Superfund program will receive $102 million from
Occidental, with $27 million going to the Treasury on behalf
of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, DoJ said. FEMA
provided funding for early cleanup and relocation efforts
before creation of the Superfund program in 1980.

Remediation Actions Taken

   After enactment of the Superfund law, the U.S. government
and New York remediated the Love Canal site. Creeks and
sewers adjacent to Love Canal were cleansed of dioxin
wastes, and federal and state agencies improved a leachate
collection system to contain contaminated groundwater.

   Occidental was considered a "responsible party" under
Superfund. The company has insisted that the United States
also was a responsible party and should contribute toward
cleanup costs based on regulatory actions and alleged
dumping by several federal agencies. Under the settlement,
the government will pay $8 million in cleanup costs to
resolve this claim.

   One bright spot for Occidental could be a proposed $64.5
million tax credit for its Love Canal payment-a proposal
that was criticized by Lois Schiffer, head of DoJ's
environmental section. "This would destroy the fundamental
principle that a polluter should pay to clean up its own
mess."

   Joining Reno in supporting the agreement was EPA
Administrator Carol Browner, who said it represented "this
Administration's firm commitment to ensuring that polluters,
not the American people, pick up the tab for cleaning up
toxic waste dumps." FEMA expressed relief that "the
Superfund law has enabled us to recover our money." The
settlement will not be final until after a 30-day public
comment period. For more information, call DoJ at (202) 616-
2771.

EPA OFFICIALS: BUDGET REDUCTIONS
COULD LEAD TO MAJOR STAFF LAYOFFS


   The temporary furloughing of EPA workers under the
partial government shutdown may turn into permanent layoffs
for up to one-quarter of the agency's 17,000 employees by
spring, EPA officials warn. Unless Republicans substantially
increase EPA's funding, the agency's cut in employees "will
be devastating," EPA Administrator Carol Browner says.

   While officials have repeatedly said they cannot predict
how deep personnel cuts would be, they estimate that under
the EPA appropriations bill vetoed by President Clinton, the
agency would have to lay off one-third of its workers who
promulgate regulations, issue permits and perform
inspections. Researchers and employees involved in
environmental cleanups would not be cut, according to one
official.

   At a press conference Dec. 18, President Clinton said he
vetoed the $5.7 billion spending bill-that called for a
decrease of 21 percent from the fiscal 1995 level-because
environmental enforcement would be cut 25 percent, safe
drinking water aid to local governments would be slashed 45
percent and the air would become dirtier. The cuts would
condemn "10 million children under the age of 12 to living
near toxic waste sites that might not be cleaned up for
years," Clinton said.

   The spending bill (H.R. 2099) contains six policy riders,
including a first-ever provision that would prevent EPA from
overriding Army Corps of Engineers' wetlands decisions. The
package also proposes a 50 percent cut in funding to
implement the Montreal treaty for protection of the ozone
layer.

   In his veto statement, Clinton said that "when I agreed a
few weeks ago to work with the Congress to balance the
budget in seven years, Congress committed to a budget that
protects the environment. These bills that I have to veto
today, I do because they do not meet that test. For 25
years, leaders of both parties have recognized that our
country is stronger when we control pollution and protect
public health. Environmental protection is not, or at least
it never has been until now, a partisan issue."

   In response to earlier Democratic attacks on EPA funding
cuts, Sen. Christopher Bond (R-Mo), chairman of the Senate
Appropriations subcommittee that handles EPA funding, said:
"I am first to admit EPA did receive some targeted budget
cuts in the appropriations process, but the reductions come
from areas which were identified by the National Academy of
Public Administration and others as being unnecessary,
wasteful or duplicative."

SENATE ENVIRONMENT PANEL MEMBERS
BACKING LIMITED REWRITING OF CWA


   Key members of the Senate Environment Committee are
making it clear they support little more than a fine-tuning
of the Clean Water Act in the 104th Congress-not the
sweeping rollback bill passed by the House (A/WPR, May. 22,
1995, p. 163).

   Chairman John Chafee (R-R.I.), in the first of a series
of hearings on reauthorizing the CWA, said he favors a
modest bill with a limited agenda because a more ambitious
package such as H.R. 961 would be harder to get through the
legislative process and would engender strident opposition
that would undermine more important goals.

   The panel's ranking Democrat, Max Baucus of Montana, said
the CWA is a "major, major success story" and that "House
efforts to gut" it were "shortsighted, misdirected and
wrongheaded....No CWA reauthorization would be better than
the one the House suggested." Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.)
added that health and economic benefits for the fishing and
tourism industries have justified the high costs of CWA-
mandated improvements.

   A frequent critic of environmental laws, Sen. Christopher
Bond (R-Mo.), told the hearing that the CWA deserves credit
for rehabilitating the Mississippi River. He said water
quality has been getting better over the past two decades
and that he supports continued progress. Bond said he will
work to fix CWA stormwater provisions he considers "broken"
and will stress the importance of proceeding with an
understanding of what local entities, states and the federal
government can afford. "We have cities spending upwards of
$650,000 to obtain [stormwater discharge] permits. This
expenditure does not result in cleaner waters." Bond added
that "assessing humungous [CWA] fines against small
communities with limited resources is probably the dumbest
thing you can do if you want to improve the environment."

   The focus on the hearing was the CWA's impact on state
and local governments. Sen. Larry Pressler (R-S.D.) urged
the committee to consider his proposal, S. 1390, to allow
CWA fines to be invested in local pollution prevention and
remediation rather than sending the money to Washington.

Move to Ease Privatization

   Lautenberg has introduced S 1436 to help local
governments privatize wastewater facilities by addressing a
legal quirk setting different standards for privately- and
publicly-owned systems. The bill would expand the definition
of a publicly-owned treatment works to include systems that
were constructed, owned or operated by government but
transferred to the private sector. Ronald Dungan, president
of the National Association of Water Companies, testified
that more private-sector participation is needed in
wastewater treatment because the cost of repairing and
maintaining infrastructure is beyond the finances of
governments and municipal utilities. Dungan said S 1436
would provide a "single and clear definition of a wastewater
treatment facility based on purpose rather than ownership."

   Al Bilik, president of the AFL-CIO's public employee
department, said organized labor strongly opposes
privatization because it would result in a deterioration of
the quality of public works. Businesses' top priority is
making money, not public well-being, he testified. Investors
might be able to buy public utilities at bargain-basement
prices and milk them for profit while maintaining an outward
appearance of functioning well, Bilik said. If the utility
goes bankrupt, the government will be left holding the bag
because these services are vital, he warned.

   Robert Perciasepe, head of EPA's water office, said that
in order to make $2 billion in loans to states annually for
the next 30 years, $10 billion needs to be invested in the
wastewater state revolving fund (SRF) over the next seven
years. President Clinton requested $1.59 billion in fiscal
1996 to support the SRF program. The appropriations bill
passed by Congress would provide $1.25 billion for
wastewater capitalization grants for 1996, Perciasepe said.
EPA is requesting authorization levels of $1.3 billion for
fiscal 1997 and $1 billion for 1998 through 2005.

API ASKS EPA TO REVISIT RFG PHASE II
TO REPEAL NOX-REDUCTION PROVISIONS


   The American Petroleum Institute is asking EPA to repeal
provisions in the second phase of the reformulated gasoline
(RFG) program requiring reductions in nitrogen oxide
emissions. The trade group says in a petition that the NOx-
reduction requirements are not a cost-effective means to
control summertime ozone and may not be beneficial. API also
argues that reductions in NOx have been demonstrated in some
cases not to be an effective way to curb ozone.

   The NOx requirement was based partly on a 1991 National
Research Council report that said more attention should be
focused on NOx as a means to control ozone. The second phase
of the RFG program calls for NOx emissions reductions of 5
percent to 7 percent, beginning in 2000. API's petition
states that although EPA used findings from that study, it
discounted "those portions of the same studies showing that
NOx control may be counterproductive in many areas,
depending on the VOC/NOx ratio."

Disagreement over Costs

   There is considerable debate on the cost of the
desulfurization of gasoline, a major part of the RFG
program. While EPA contends that reducing sulfur to 138
parts per million would have a nationwide cost of about
$5,200 per ton, API counsel David Deal said the cost is
closer to more than $10,000 per ton. Deal said this cost
would be passed on to consumers. "We have good reason to
want to reassess the program before people make a
commitment."

   The petition makes another point concerning costs,
stating that the cost of controlling NOx emissions in fuels
relative to the cost of stationary sources has not been
given enough attention by EPA.

   API wants the agency to respond promptly so refiners may
have enough time to make the necessary adjustments to their
facilities. Although phase II of the RFG program does not
begin for another five years, "the lead time to make
refinery changes is about three years. So sometime in 1997
is the time by which it is important to know what the story
is," Deal said. A copy of the 32-page petition is available
from BPI's % DocuDial Service as Doc. #03-1104.

EW FOCUS: OPEN MEETINGS
HAZWASTE INCINERATORS, GREEN GROUPS
CHALLENGE EPA-CEMENT NEGOTIATIONS


   A lawsuit seeking to prevent EPA from using closed-door
meetings with the cement kiln industry to reach an
"enforceable agreement" on cement kiln dust (CKD) disposal
rules is coming down to whether the selective process can be
defined as a federal advisory committee. The
plaintiffs-Environmental Technology Council (ETC), Sierra
Club and four local environmental advocacy groups-contend
that EPA-cement industry meetings since March violate the
Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). The cement industry
and EPA argue they do not.

   A cement industry official told EW Dec. 27 that despite
the diverse makeup of the plaintiffs, the case is being
pushed by the incinerator industry in an effort to gain
competitive advantage in the market for waste-treatment
services.

   The suit (Huron Environmental Activist League et al. v.
U.S. EPA, DC DC, No. 95-2124) was filed Nov. 15 (EW, Dec. 4,
1995, p. 473). The battle widened when the Cement Kiln
Recycling Coalition (CKRC) and the American Portland Cement
Alliance (APCA) intervened as defendants on Nov. 29. Since
then, papers have been flying: motions for summary judgment
were filed by all sides Dec. 8; all sides filed responses
Dec. 15, prompting still further motions. Judge Charles
Richey of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia will decide soon as to whether EPA's meetings with
the cement industry violate FACA requirements.

   FACA is meant to control how private groups become a
source of advice and recommendations to Federal agencies. It
requires notice of meetings in the Federal Register and that
an agency official approve agendas and be present at all
meetings.

   EPA and the cement industry had been negotiating since
March over an enforceable agreement on CKD disposal. The
agency had already decided not to expose cement kilns to all
of the rigors of the Resource Conservation & Recovery Act's
(RCRA) Subtitle C, which governs disposal of hazardous
wastes. The plaintiffs charge that seven EPA-cement industry
meetings violated FACA. EPA got advice on management
standards from only one interest group, "closed its meetings
with the cement industry...and denied plaintiffs' request
to attend the meetings," says the Dec. 8 defendants' motion
for summary judgment.

   EPA allegedly provided no public notice, no meeting
summaries and no agendas, and no documents developed from
the meetings were made available to the public. The
plaintiffs also charge that EPA utilized APCA and CKRC as an
"advisory committee" in the sense of FACA without formally
establishing one. Once the cement industry proposed that the
agency promulgate an "enforceable agreement" to manage CKD
standards, EPA crossed the line into territory governed by
FACA, the plaintiffs contend.

   In its motion, EPA contends that the cement kiln groups
cannot be defined as "advisory committees" under FACA
because they were not established, funded or controlled by
the government. Mere use of the committee's work product is
not enough to trigger FACA rules; the government must
exercise strict management over the group, EPA argues. EPA
referred to the only FACA case judged by the U.S. Supreme
Court (Public Citizen v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 491 U.S.
1989), in which the justices upheld EPA's consultations with
the activist group founded by Ralph Nader. In that case, the
majority wrote: "We cannot believe that FACA was intended to
cover every formal and informal consultation between an
agency and a group rendering advice."

   In a response filed Dec. 15, the plaintiffs maintain that
EPA managed the advisory group and its agenda; controlled
the process by identifying the issues for the group to
address; controlled participation by denying plaintiffs'
requests to attend meetings; and suspended its efforts to
develop regulatory standards in order to conduct the
advisory-group process. The plaintiffs also argue they will
not have meaningful input on an enforceable agreement if
they cannot meet simultaneously with the cement industry and
EPA.

   Andy O'Hare, vice president of APCA, told EW that the
rival waste-incineration industry "has been meeting with EPA
all along but claims that only the cement kiln industry's
private meetings are in violation of FACA." In its motion,
EPA says that it met at least once since March with all of
the plaintiffs on the enforceable agreement.

   O'Hare, while claiming CKD is "innocuous" from a public
health standpoint, said the plaintiffs are led by the
incinerator industry. "This whole case should be seen as an
attempt by the incinerator industry to regain
"competitivity." It is not an environmental issue; it is a
market-share issue." ETC, formerly known as the Hazardous
Waste Treatment Council, filed the case using their lawyer
and brought along the environmentalists to bolster the case
for the incinerator interests, he charged.

   ETC lawyer David Case was not available to respond to the
statements about the suit's genesis.

CALIFORNIA AIR BOARD MOVES TO DROP

   California has begun formalizing its retreat from its
smog-fighting mandate for zero emission vehicles (ZEVs) to
comprise at least 2 percent of the new cars and light trucks
marketed in the state in 1998.

   The action throws into doubt whether Massachusetts and
New York will maintain their similar mandates, which would
translate into minimum sales of electric vehicles.
Massachusetts Gov. William Weld (R) said, "We think the
California Air Resources [Board] staff made the wrong
recommendation, but the decision does not bind
Massachusetts." In New York, a spokesman for Gov. George
Pataki (R) made only the following statement: "the staff is
evaluating New York State's legal obligation in the wake of
California's decision."

   Electric car supporters and clean-air advocates charge
that California Gov. Pete Wilson (R) gave into the massive
anti-electric vehicle advertising and public relations
campaign financed by petroleum refiners and car
manufacturers.

Mandate for 2003 Retained

   California's Air Resources Board (CARB), which pioneered
ZEV-sales mandates, will sponsor ZEV demonstration projects
in Los Angeles and Sacramento. They will use only 3,750
ZEVs, rather than the 60,000 projected under the shelved
mandate. CARB maintains its requirement that 10 percent of
total vehicles sales in the state will be ZEVs in 2003.

   CARB Chair John Dunlap said: "This [revised] plan
provides for a successful launch of commercially viable
electric cars that protect public health and will provide
new high-tech jobs in California. This plan promotes a
market-based introduction of ZEVs and will unleash the
engineering and the marketing prowess of automakers."

   A spokesman for the California-based Coalition for Clean
Air said the group has "seen no scientific or technical
reason for delay. The agency responsible for worldwide
adoption of catalytic converters, unleaded gasoline and
reformulated gasoline has never before buckled to political
pressure."

   The ZEV retreat is laid out in a CARB staff proposal that
is subject to change pending final action in March. Other
staff recommendations include:

Automakers voluntarily introduce ZEVs, with an annual
production capacity of 5,000 in 1996-1997 rising to 14,000
in 1998.

Automakers produce cleaner standard cars to make up for the
shortfall in lower emissions without the ZEVs.

Automakers place 750 ZEVs in 1998 and 1,500 in 1999-2000 in
the Los Angeles and Sacramento areas.

Automakers commit to continued ZEV research and development.

CARB creates extra ZEV credits for longer-range vehicles and
early introduction of electrics.

Each year the state will buy some advanced-battery vehicles.

The staff proposal also calls upon all automakers to change
their media publicity and legislative initiatives from
attacking the ZEV mandate to supporting the state-
manufacturers' ZEV partnership.

COSTLY RULE SETS MACT STANDARDS
FOR NEWER MUNICIPAL INCINERATORS


   Newer municipal waste combustors (MWCs) will be required
to install a combination of high-efficiency pollution-
control equipment starting Jan. 29, if a direct final rule
from EPA does not draw significant negative comments. While
the rule enables EPA to reduce several pollutants
simultaneously, it is expected to impose substantial capital
costs.

   The maximum achievable control technology standard will
affect existing and new MWCs capable of combusting more than
35 metric tons daily. It establishes emissions limits for
dioxins, furans, cadmium, lead, mercury, particulate matter,
hydrogen chloride, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and
fugitive ash. Stricter performance standards apply to MWCs
with capacities greater than 225 metric tons a day.

   The rule, published in the Dec. 19 Federal Register,
mandates that MWCs built after Sept. 20, 1994, or modified
after June 19, 1996, will be subject to new, more stringent
performance standards. MWCs built between Dec. 20, 1989 and
Sept. 20, 1994, or modified before June 19, 1996, will
remain subject to MWC performance standards for plants built
after the 1989 date. This provision was promulgated Feb. 11,
1991. The dates were set to avoid same MWC plants being
subject to overlapping rules.

   EPA says there are about 307 operating MWC units at 128
plants, providing a total combustion capacity of 94,000
metric tons per day. It says that 179 MWCs will be affected
by the rule; about 100 are publicly owned. Costs for the
updated standard exceed those for the 1991 standard by $156
million for capital investment and by $43 million for annual
operations. Total capital costs from investments mandated by
both rules approach $780 million, or an added $13 per metric
ton of solid waste combusted.

   The agency says the benefits include annual emissions
greater than the 1991 rule: 3,000 fewer metric tons of SO2
and 4,000 fewer metric tons of hydrogen chloride. For most
categories there is less than a 10 percent improvement, but
for mercury, the new standard will eliminate 200 percent of
the amount removed by the 1991 rule. In total, the rule
expects to reduce emissions of several hazardous air
pollutants by about 110,000 tons per year, EPA says.

   If a facility combusts less than 10 metric tons a day of
solid waste, regardless of capacity, it is exempted from the
rule. Tire-burning facilities are exempted from the
performance standard but not re-cordkeeping requirements.
Small independent power producers, cogeneration facilities
and metals recovery facilities are not subject to MWC
standards.

   The regulation, simultaneously released as a direct final
rule and a proposed rule, takes effect Jan 29 unless
significant adverse comments are received by Jan. 18. For
more information call Walter Stevenson, emission standards
division, (919) 541-5264.

EPA CITES NPS FOR RCRA VIOLATIONS
AT HAWAII VOLCANOES NATIONAL PARK


   EPA is asking the National Park Service (NPS) to pay a
$243,800 penalty for allegedly storing hazardous wastes at
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park last year without the
required Resource Conservation & Recovery Act permit. The
wastes included acetone, chromium, lead, xylene, phenol,
arsenic, mercury and other substances generated by road
building, automotive maintenance and labs studying
volcanoes.
   NPS also was cited for storing wastes in containers that
were rusted or leaking despite having acceptable containers
on site which could have been used. The park removed the
containers with the waste in October 1995. EPA has ordered
the facility to develop a hazardous waste-management plan
within two months. It must include procedures ensuring that
all hazardous waste is moved off site shortly after it is
generated. For more information, contact EPA's Lois Grunwald
at (415) 744-1588.

EPA: HEALTH BENEFITS EXCEED COSTS
OF REDUCING ACID RAIN PRECURSORS


   The Clean Air Act's acid-rain provisions will provide
between $3 billion and $11 billion worth of health benefits
in 1997 to residents of 31 eastern states, according to an
assessment by EPA.

   The agency's report also says the value of health
benefits from reducing acid-rain precursors will be even
greater once the controls are fully in place by 2010. The
cost of complying with the acid-rain provisions are expected
to range from $1.2 billion to $2.4 billion in 2010, the
report adds.

   Sulfate aerosols comprise about 40 percent of inhalable
particulate matter in the eastern United States, according
to the report. Reductions in the number of new cases of
chronic bronchitis account for another 9 percent of the
health benefits, with other avoided problems accounting for
the remainder.

   EPA's Regional Acid Deposition Model provided the basis
for the report, which also used SO2 emission reductions
projected to occur under Title IV to estimate atmospheric
sulfate aerosol concentrations in the eastern United States
and Canada. This data were combined with 1990 Census data to
forecast population levels in portions of the two countries
where changes in sulfate levels are projected.

   The study used published epidemiology studies that link
certain health effects with sulfate level changes and
willingness-to-pay estimates published in economic
literature to put a value on changes in health, according to
EPA.

   The report was prepared by EPA's acid rain division as
part of an effort to estimate the total costs and benefits
of the Clean Air Act. To obtain a copy, call EPA's Acid Rain
Hotline at (202) 233-9620 or the Acid Rain Division's
homepage on the Internet at

EPA, ASIWPCA ISSUE DRAFT GUIDANCE
FOR EVALUATING NONPOINT PROGRAMS


   States would have nine major components upon which to
evaluate and upgrade their runoff pollution-control
programs, according to a draft guidance issued by EPA and an
association of state officials.

   The guidance allows states to review and revise their
programs to include:

Explicit short- and long-term goals for protecting surface
and ground waters.

A balance between statewide, nonpoint-source programs and
on-the-ground management of individual watersheds where
water bodies are polluted or threatened.

Abatement of water quality impairments from current sources
and possible future activities.

Identification of waters and watersheds polluted or
threatened by polluted runoff.

A review, upgrade and implementation of all program
components required under Section 319 of the Clean Water
Act.

Efficient and effective program management.

Strong working partnerships with appropriate groups.

Identification of federal lands and goals that are in
harmony with state program goals.

A feedback loop through which the state reviews, evaluates
and revises its nonpoint-source program and its management
every five years.

   A state that follows these requirements would be
considered a Tier I state and would be given more
flexibility than other states, the draft guidance says. EPA
would also provide states with the necessary technical and
financial assistance.

   The final guidance is slated for release in March 1996.
Comments are being sought through Jan. 19. The draft
guidance is available through the Internet at
http://www.epa.gov/owow. It also is available from the
Association of State and Interstate Water Pollution Control
Administrators at (202) 898-0905.

STATE OFFICIALS SEE HWIR PROPOSAL
COMPLICATING WASTE MANAGEMENT


   While some industry officials are cheering possible
exemptions of certain hazardous waste from strict management
requirements under the proposed Hazardous Waste
Identification Rule (HWIR), state management officials are
expecting their role to become more complicated.

   The self-implementing rule would require state officials
to conduct more sampling and inspecting at facilities to
ensure these businesses are complying with the rule, said
Jennifer Kaduck, chief of the hazardous waste branch for the
Georgia Environmental Protection Department. The proposal
sets concentration levels below which generators can manage
hazardous process waste constituents under Subtitle D of the
Resource Conservation & Recovery Act.

   The rule would be difficult to enforce, Kaduck said.
Although state agencies already have done much inspection
and sampling, HWIR will increase these responsibilities
considerably, she said. "We have an obligation to the
public" to ensure businesses are properly complying with the
rule, she said.

Many Questions Expected

   States also would have to consider the costs of adopting
the rule, according to Susan Ferguson, director of waste
policy for the Texas Natural Resources Conservation
Commission. An overlooked upfront cost states would incur is
the time spent answering questions from the regulated
community, Ferguson said. The rule is self-implementing for
businesses, and companies are likely to ask about testing of
waste to determine the hazardous concentration, she said.

   The proposed rule (EW, Nov. 27, 1995, p. 451) also may
skew state funding, officials say. Many state agencies
receive federal funding based on the management of hazardous
waste, Ferguson said.

   State officials do not know how many businesses would
seek to remove waste from Subtitle C requirements through
the HWIR or how much of the waste stream would meet the new
exit level, Ferguson said. The levels are fairly low, and
treatment residue and wastewater possibly are the most
likely to exit Subtitle C. Ferguson said she hopes companies
will modify processes to limit the amount of listed
hazardous waste they generate.

   Some officials also are concerned about a section in the
rule's preamble asking for comments on a future proposal to
set contingent management exit levels for Department of
Energy mixed waste, Ferguson said. "States have not been
convinced by the data" showing mixed waste is safe in low
concentrations, she said. For more information, contact
Ferguson at (512) 239-5000 or Kaduck, at (404) 656-4713.

PHYSICIANS' GROUP SOUNDING ALERT
ABOUT DANGERS FROM AIR POLLUTION


   The American Medical Association's House of Delegates has
adopted policy resolutions urging doctors to inform the
public about air pollution's impact on the body, protecting
biological diversity and the dangers of the sun's
ultraviolet rays. The group based the recommendations on the
premise that "human health is inseparable from the health of
the natural world."

   Resolution 404 seeks to alert doctors, patients and the
public of damage to body organs and systems by indoor and
outdoor air pollution. Exposure to air pollutants occurs
through the lungs, skin and digestive tract, the resolution
states.

   John Kimball Scott, vice president of the National
Association of Physicians for the Environment, said that "it
is important to understand that pollution can affect not
only the lungs, but virtually every organ and system of the
body."

   Resolution 403 urges physicians to be aware of biological
diversity and its relationship to human health, especially
in terms of the development of drugs and biologicals derived
from plants, animals and other elements of the natural
world. Resolution 405 is intended to alert the public about
dangers from excessive exposure to ultraviolet rays in
advance of the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta.

GREENHOUSE 'CAR TALKS' REPORT URGES
BOOSTING CAFE STANDARD TO 45 MPG


   Raising the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE)
standard to 45 miles per gallon is the single biggest step
that can be taken to slow global warning, according the
Clinton Administration's Policy Dialogue Advisory Committee
on Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions From Personal Motor
Vehicles. Because the technology to raise CAFE to 45 mpg is
available, benefits from this step would be evident before
those produced by reduced driving and alternative fuels, the
"car talks" committee says.

   The recommendation is contained in an executive summary
issued by a majority of the committee, which was unable to
reach consensus following more than a year of discussions
among regulators, environmental advocacy groups and affected
industries such as automakers and oil companies. Although
the process stalemated, the committee majority said in its
Dec. 13 report that three key actions can be taken to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions: higher CAFE, reduced driving and
cleaner fuels.

Tire 'Feebates' Recommended

   Higher CAFE standards, plus research and development
support, should be implemented in 1998 to provide market
incentives, the summary says. Introducing "feebates" for low
rolling-resistance tires will also help fuel economy, it
adds.

   Recommended alternative fuels measures include supporting
further research and development for electric vehicles and
infrastructure; tax credits for natural gas vehicles and
infrastructure; more support for liquid biofuels research
and development; and production incentives for low-emitting
fuels.

   Driving-reduction steps include encouraging the equitable
shift of state and local road subsidies to cost-of-driving;
encouraging land-use away from auto dependency by improving
fixed-route and on-demand transit services plus bicycle and
pedestrian access; and reforming workplace parking-subsidy
programs.

   The committee majority contended that its suggestions are
needed if the United States is to meet its obligation under
the Framework Convention on Climate Change. Besides reducing
vehicle emissions, the suggestions should also reduce urban
smog and consumer expenditures, create jobs and eliminate
U.S. reliance on imported oil, the summary says. For a copy
of the report, contact Roni Lieberman of the Sierra Club at
(202) 675-7903.

EPA PROPOSES AIR PERMIT EXEMPTIONS
FOR SOME NON-MAJOR AREA SOURCES


   Chromium electroplaters, dry cleaners and commercial
sterilizers would benefit from amended EPA rules for new
area sources of hazardous air pollutants. A rule proposed
Dec. 13 would give these source categories a reprieve from
Clean Air Act operating permit requirements.

   Except in the case of Subpart X, the action proposes to
lift the requirement that these non-major sources obtain
Title V operating permits. An EPA amendment to Subpart X
confirms that existing non-major secondary lead smelting
facilities will still be subject to Title V permit rules.

   EPA says the purpose of the proposal is to reduce the
regulatory burden on states and local agencies, EPA regional
offices and industry "at a time when tremendous resources
are necessary for the initial implementation of the Title V
permit program."

   Regulatory agencies, overburdened by a backlog of permit
applications, will be unable to assist nonmajor sources,
forcing these small businesses to go through greater pains
to deal with the regulation. Loosening the permitting rule
will not affect a source's obligation to implement maximum
achievable control technology by the assigned date,
according to EPA.

   On a case-by-case basis, states will consider whether to
grant facility exemptions for perchlo-roethelyne from dry
cleaners, ethylene oxide from commercial sterilizers, hard
and decorative chromium electroplaters or anodizing tanks
and halogenated solvent cleaning. Only the standard for
halogenated solvent cleaning previously had a permitting
exemption. EPA decided to grant a permanent exemption from
permitting requirements to decorative chromium operations
that use either fume suppressants or trivalent chromium bath
technologies to reduce emissions.

   The exemptions would not apply to secondary lead smelters
because the agency judged that meeting permitting
requirements would not impose an "undue burden" on them.
There are only 16 secondary lead smelters, and five of these
are non-major sources, the proposal states. "Additionally,
the five non-major smelters are owned by relatively large
companies [that]...should be better equipped to handle the
Part 70 permitting process than the small businesses
characterizing the other source categories." Comments on the
proposal will be accepted through Jan. 12. For more
information, contact Lalit Banker of the emission standards
division, (919) 541-5420.

REFRIGERATOR MAKERS SETTLE LAWSUIT
OVER 'CFC-FREE' ADVERTISEMENTS


   Three manufacturers have agreed to change advertising
claims about ozone-depleting chemicals used in their
refrigerators to settle a California lawsuit brought by
three environmental advocacy groups.

   The lawsuit, Ozone Action v. Amana Refrigeration, (No.
973282) was filed in San Francisco Superior Court by
Environmental Law Foundation, Earth Day 2000, and Ozone
Action. It alleged that General Electric Co., Amana
Refrigeration Inc., and Whirl-pool Corp. and several
retailers were making false claims about so-called "CFC-
free" refrigerators in violation of California's "Green"
labeling law and Federal Trade Commission guidelines for
environmental marketing claims.

   The refrigerator manufacturers agreed to furnish stickers
to dealers stating the refrigerators contain HCFC-14b, a
known ozone depleting chemical, and to display store posters
listing the HCFC content of the refrigerators. The three
manufacturers, as part of the settlement announced Dec. 22,
also are making a $100,000 grant for further study of ozone
depletion.

   The suit said the "CFC-Free" ads, while true, were
misleading consumers into believing the refrigerators did
not harm the ozone layer. HCFCs contribute to ozone-layer
loss, but are a far smaller factor than CFCs. The
defendants, which included Sears Roebuck & Co., Circuit City
Inc., Montgomery Ward & Co. and Basic Living Products, said
they did not believe the advertising was misleading.

   In a separate action, the three environmental groups said
they and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group will sue
Maytag and Sony for allegedly failing to label their
refrigerators as containing CFCs-a designation required by
the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments.

GREAT LAKES EFFORT COULD BE DAMAGED
BY GOP BUDGET CUTS, BROWNER SAYS


   The Republican-drafted EPA appropriations bill vetoed by
President Clinton may cost the Great Lakes initiative more
than $245 million in water quality funding, EPA
Administrator Carol Browner says.

   Browner issued the findings of an economic analysis
estimating costs and benefits of the final guidance issued
by EPA that sets water quality standards for the Great Lakes
area. She noted that EPA has made strides in the Great Lakes
cleanup over the past 25 years but that the fiscal 1996
spending bill threatens the Great Lakes effort.

   The bill also would limit EPA's ability to take
enforcement actions in the Great Lakes area, Browner said.
EPA and the Great Lakes states made more than 19,000
inspections and took more than 2,000 enforcement actions in
the eight-state area in 1994. "With the Republican budget,
the environmental cop would not be on the beat," she said.

   Great Lakes Superfund sites would also be hurt, according
to Browner, who said 434 sites in the area would not be
cleaned up because the bill "cuts funding of toxic waste
cleanup by 25 percent."

   The cost-benefit analysis that was performed on the area
justifies the potential costs of the Great Lakes initiative,
according to EPA. Three case studies of representative
communities were used for the analysis: the Fox River near
Green Bay, Wis.; the Saginaw River near Bay City, Mich.; and
the Black River near Cleveland.

   The analysis said the Fox River area would pay $3.6
million for water-quality improvements and receive benefits
worth $4.5 million, while the Saginaw River area would pay
$2.6 million and receive benefits worth $4 million. However,
the Black River area would pay $2.1 million and receive
benefits worth $900,000, according to the study.

   Copies of the Great Lakes reports are available by
calling (513) 489-8910. For more information on the
guidance, contact Jim Hanlon (202) 260-5400 or Mark Morris

CALIFORNIA'S AIR RESOURCES BOARD
MANDATES CLEANER-BURNING FUEL


   The California Air Resources Board has mandated that
cleaner-burning gasoline be sold statewide, a step officials
expect will reduce vehicular emissions by about 1 billion
pounds annually. The gasoline is produced by changing the
refinery process to reduce toxic compounds and sulfur
content of gasoline.

   Although the price of the gasoline cannot be predicted
because prices are dependant on market conditions, CARB
estimates that production costs will be between five and 15
cents a gallon.

   CARB officials says the new gasoline has undergone
extensive testing, with more than 800 cars driven more than
5 million miles. It will be available in the same octane
levels as the current gasoline. For more information, call
(800) 566-6655.


   CALIFORNIA-The San Diego Regional Water Quality Control
Board has refused to reduce two fines totaling $6.2 million
against the San Diego for sewage spill and treatment
violations. City officials offered $1.1 million toward a
proposed $3.7 million fine for a 1993 spill in Los
Penasquitos Lagoon and a separate $2.5 million fine for
inadequate sludge treatment. A senior deputy city attorney
said the city is negotiating with the regional board. San
Diego has gone to court seeking relief from the fine, and
Superior Court Judge Judith McConnell remanded the matter to
the board for a rehearing.

   COLORADO-Home Depot U.S.A. Inc., U.S. EPA and the state
have announced a prospective-purchaser agreement to resolve
potential liability claims and foster commercial property
development in Denver. The deal requires Home Depot to clean
up a portion of a Superfund site in exchange for agreement
by the governmental agencies not to sue it for liability.
The company also will operate and maintain the property to
ensure there will be no risk to the public health or
environment from past contamination. Home Depot plans a
store on the remediated site. Cleanup will be supervised by
the state Department of Public Health and Environment.

   DELAWARE-The Department of Natural Resources and
Environmental Control has proposed a trading program for air
emissions. The proposal would allow industries to earn
credits for voluntarily reducing emissions of volatile
organic compounds or nitrogen oxides below levels set under
state regulations. If a facility exceeds the targeted levels
for emission reductions, 90 percent of the excess could be
banked, with the remainder retired to assure additional air-
quality improvements. A facility seeking to expand
operations could use its banked credits to offset additional
VOC or NOx emissions or buy credits from another facility at
whatever price it can negotiate. A program audit would be
conducted every three years, and public comment would be
solicited during the permit-approval process. Two public
hearings will be held this month, with final adoption of the
rules expected in April.

   MASSACHUSETTS-The legislature has authorized $100 million
in bonds to continue state hazardous site cleanups. A $60
million fund that has paid for cleanups since 1987 had
fallen to $150,000 when the House passed the reauthorization
bond. The state had halted cleanup at 73 sites and had
expected to close down the remaining remediation operations.
Contractors are working again on all state cleanup
activities, a state official said. For more information,

   NEW JERSEY-Auto emissions testing is being threatened by
Republican leaders in the Assembly. Assembly Speaker Garabed
Haytaian and Majority Leader Jack Collins have said they are
willing to make changes in the law to respond to public
concerns about the program. The testing has become
controversial because other states are bailing out of the
federally mandated program and because of publicity that
claimed the law would lead the state to confiscate cars. The
law regulating testing, passed just five months ago,
requires owners of vehicles that fail the test to correct
problems. Both lawmakers have said there is enough time to
make changes because the program is not scheduled to start
until 1997.

   TEXAS-The Border Environmental Cooperation Commission has
approved a $11.7 million waste water treatment and reuse
project for El Paso. BECC, a bilateral body arising from the
North American Free Trade Agreement, will certify additional
projects at its next meeting. They are expected to include a
$40 million wastewater treatment plant in Ciudad Juarez,
Mexico; a $1 million wastewater treatment plant in
Matamoros, Mexico; a $7.8 million tire recycling project in
Mexicali, Mexico; a $52 million water distribution and
treatment project in Nogales, Mexico; a $770,000 water
supply and waste water treatment plant in Naco, Mexico; a
$118 million urban development and environmental improvement
project in Rio Tijuana, Mexico; a $2.7 million upgrading
plan for a wastewater treatment plant in Somerton, Calif.;
and a $2 million upgrading plan for a water system in
Douglas, Ariz.

AGING DNEPR RIVER HYDRO PROJECTS
THREATEN MANY AREAS OF UKRAINE


   Decrepit Soviet-built hydroelectric works along the Dnepr
River are putting vast areas of Ukraine at risk of flooding,
according to an group of international experts. The group
warns that excessively high water levels may cause the sand
and soil foundation of the Kakhovka Reservoir to collapse.

   The failure of this dam would release a 20-30 meter high
wave moving at 130 km. per hour, capable of destroying some
cities and hundreds of towns in the Kherson, Odessa, Crimea
and Nikolayev regions, the authors of the study document
said.

   Chemicals, oil products and waste contained in the
reservoir would create an environmental disaster, destroying
soil in the Dnepr Basin and life in the Black Sea and
irreparably damaging coastal areas and resorts on the Azov
and Black seas. Vasyl Durdynets, Ukraine's minister for
state security and emergencies, said the government is aware
of the consequences of a disaster and will submit a plan for
the safe functioning of the Dnepr reservoirs to the
government's commission on environmental safety.


   AUSTRALIA-The nation has withheld endorsement of three
Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development
environmental resolutions, surprising observers who expect
environmentally friendly actions from Australia. The main
blockage is over binding resolutions to extend to non-member
countries mutual acceptance of data and guidelines for
chemical testing. Australia also has reservations about
guidelines on setting up a pollutant release and transfer
registry modeled on the U.S. Toxic Release Inventory.
Another source of discord may concern the "greening" of
government operations. Contact: Bill Long, OECD, (+33 1) 45
24 8200.

   CANADA-British Columbia has adopted Canada's most
rigorous new-vehicle emission standards. They are aimed at
reducing pollution at least 50 percent by 2010 and 70
percent by 2020 in the southwest corner of the province. The
law stipulates that by 1998, all cars sold in British
Columbia will have to meet U.S. emissions standards, which
are stricter than Canada's. By 2001, all new vehicles sold
in the province will have to be certified under "California"
standards and emit on average 70 percent less of certain
pollutants than current vehicles, if they are to sold in the
province. The standards also mandate that zero-emission
vehicles comprise 10 percent of the market by 2003. Contact:
Environment Canada, (819) 997-2800.

   CHILE-The Ministry of Mining says government and private
sector actions against air pollution will bring mining
operations and smelters up to U.S. and European standards by
2000. Technical requirements to set emission levels and
other standards should be passed by next June, and existing
decrees aimed at specific pollutants have already affected
mining, ministry official say. Large sources such as copper
producers Codelco and ENAMI, are said to be committed to
becoming more environmentally responsible. Contact: Janet
Maritano, Ministry of Mining; (+56 2) 696-5872.

   ECUADOR-Fundacion Jatun Sacha has acquired 4,000 acres of
wet forest, with the goal of preserving the last 0.8 percent
of land in western Ecuador. It describes the land as having
the world's richest biodiversity. The group says it needs
12,500 acres to adequately protect life forms but is
competing with a logging company that is eyeing the entire
area. Contact: World Parks Endowment, 1616 P St. NW, #200,
Washington, DC 20036; (202) 939-3808.

   JAPAN-The Ministry of International Trade and Industry
has asked private businesses to prepare new voluntary anti-
pollution plans to conform with ISO 14000 environmental-
management standards. MITI's directive also promotes
recycling, non-polluting vehicles, measures to reduce air,
water, soil and noise pollution and alternative energy
sources, including solar power.

   NEPAL-This Himalayan nation and the European Union have
agreed to improve environmental cooperation. The accord, the
first between the E.U. and Nepal, calls for the creation of
a permanent mechanism for facilitating communication on
environmental and other issues.

   NEW ZEALAND/AUSTRALIA-A cooperative waste program
announced at the 10th bilateral Environment and Conservation
Council creates an "interim biogeographical regionalization"
of the two nations to identify shortcomings in national
wildlife protection. The governments will create a
comprehensive mechanism for protecting natural areas.

   SOUTH KOREA-Seoul has decided not to build a nuclear
waste repository on Kulop Island because two fault lines
were located about two miles away, the Environment Ministry
has announced. The facility was to store up to 1 million
drums of waste. South Korea now has no specific site to
store waste from its 10 nuclear power plants. Five more
plants are under construction. Contact: Environmental
Attache, South Korean Embassy, (202) 939-6463.

VOLKSWAGEN JOINS THE RACE FOR FIRST COMMERCIALLY VIABLE ELECTRIC CAR

Volkswagen AG has plans to unleash an electric vehicle
called the Chico car by the end of 1993.

The company has just developed a computerized system that will
greatly assist in mass producing the vehicle.  Volkswagen hopes that
the Chico will put it in the front-running position of the newly
developing electric car market.

ITALIAN CHEMICAL CO. INTRODUCES NEW, CLEANER DIESEL FUEL

Diesel-Bi is the name of a clean diesel fuel produced in part from
vegetable oils and methanol.  An Italian company, Novamont, based in
Milan and a subsidiary of the Ferruzzi-Montedison Group, will begin
field testing the fuel this month in South Dakota.

The company has worked closely for two years with Senator Thomas
Daschle (D-SD) who hosted a March 28 ceremony to inaugurate the field
tests.  A company spokesman said Ferruzzi is seeking eventual EPA
approval of the product so that it can be commercially sold in the
U.S.  Testing will take place in the EPA-certified laboratory in
Sioux Falls, and data from these tests along with other company tests
will be compared to 1993 and '94 clean diesel emissions standards
adopted in California.

Diesel-Bi is made of 90 percent vegetable oil and 10 percent methanol
that is "combined in the presence of a catalyst to produce a methyl
ester," a company official said.  Ethanol could be used, but methanol
is preferred by the company as more price competitive.

Palm, sunflower, soya and other oils can be used to produce
Diesel-Bi.  In Europe, canola is the feedstock most commonly used.
Some test results have shown that sulphur emissions have been
eliminated and particulates and carbon monoxide have been reduced up
to 50 percent.  The fuel can also be used in combination with
traditional diesel fuel.

Ferruzzi began his work on Diesel-Bi about two years ago and held the
first field tests in Zurich last summer.  Two buses in Sioux Falls
are scheduled to operate solely on the fuel for four months.

CHINA MOVES TOWARD VISION OF GIANT HYDRO DAM, DISPLACING 1.3 MILLION

The dream of damming the flood-prone Yangtze, which captivated Mao
Zedong in the 50's, is moving toward realization.

Everything about the project is enormous.  It will generate 84
billion kilowatts of hydroelectric power per year by 2008.  The l85-
meter-high dam will be the biggest hydropower station in the world,
as well as the world's largest ship-lift.  The price: an estimated
$l0.5 billion.

But the human cost will be equally enormous.  Some 1.3 million people
will be displaced from 140 towns (some with populations of over
l00,000) and countless villages.  Also lost will be 58,800 acres of
arable land, 159 smaller power stations, and 675 factories.

Resistance is so strong, particularly from small farmers, that a
third of the deputies to the National People's Congress, usually a
rubber-stamping body for government decisions, voted against it.

Adding to the tension is an inequality of benefits.  Sichuan
province, with 85 percent of the people to be displaced, stands to
receive only l0 percent of the power generated.  It will also face a
heightened risk of flooding.

Critics worry about the risk of the reservoir, induced earthquakes
and river bank collapses.  They also contend that the rapid
accumulation of silt will wipe out much of the gains in generating
capacity.

The dam will be financed through bonds, preferential foreign loans,
state funds, and power generation (expected to start nine years after
construction is begun).

LOS ANGELES SET TO ADD 150 MEGA-WATT GEOTHERMAL COMPLEX

Los Angeles joins the China Lake Naval Weapons Center at Coso, CA in
tapping local geothermal energy. The Los Angeles Department of Water
& Power (DWP) has awarded a contract for a nearby 150-megawatt power
complex to Calpine Corporation, which built the Navy's plant there
five years ago.

The Los Angeles DWP will lease a site from the Weapons Center, 200
miles north of the city.  Calpine, builder of both plants, also
maintains and operates the Navy's geothermal facility.

No figures have been divulged, but observers estimate the cost at
about $200 million.

SLANTS AND TRENDS


   GOOD BUDGET NEWS - Researchers and health officials
working on lead issues received good news Jan. 5 when
Congress passed a bill that will fund the National
Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) through Sept. 30, the end of
the fiscal year. This means NIH and CDC now can disperse
grants and carry out disease surveillance and other
programs. NIH received $11.9 billion, a 5.7 percent increase
over its fiscal 1995 budget. CDC, which supports a variety
of lead education and other programs, was essentially flat-
funded at $2.1 billion. The two agencies were the only ones
to be fully funded, although the targeted appropriations
measure (H.R. 1358) also allocated money for specific
federal programs such as Black Lung benefit payments. H.R.
1358, however, does not clearly define how NIH should divide
the appropriations among its 24 institutes, centers and
divisions. The House intended for the institutes to be
funded at levels close to those detailed in H.R. 2127, which
the House passed Aug. 4, committee staff said. But NIH may
be able to make some adjustments, staff said, adding the
White House Office of Management and Budget is reviewing the
question.

   However, EPA and the Occupational Health and Safety
Administration (OSHA) were not so lucky. Separate continuing
resolutions (H.R. 1643 and H.J. Res. 134) sent employees
back to work but allocated funds only through Jan. 26.
Republican Whip Sen. Trent Lott (Miss.) said Jan. 10 the GOP
will not force a third government shutdown. Instead,
Congress likely will pass targeted appropriations. "We'll
fund the programs we think are important, and we won't fund
programs we don't think important," said House Budget
Committee Chairman John Kasich (R-Ohio Jan. 14. EPA and OSHA
consistently have been targets of the GOP's frustration with
government. "[T]he Republican leadership does not care about
EPA; does not care about consumer protection; does not care
about OSHA...Corporate interests are going to have a field
day," said Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), referring to the
omission of these programs from the recent targeted
appropriations.


   LOOPHOLE NEARLY CLOSED - Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge (R)
is pushing to close a regulatory loophole benefiting
asbestos-removal companies that has long frustrated state
officials. Of the five states in the Environmental
Protection Agency's Region III, Pennsylvania is the only one
with no method to target and prosecute unscrupulous
contractors, said John Curries, spokesman for the state
Department of Labor and Industry (L&I). Pennsylvania began
the effort in 1990 when the state legislature created an
advisory committee made up of government, academic and
industry representatives to determine whether the state
should enact a licensing system. The committee endorsed the
idea and in April 1995, the L&I drafted language to turn the
recommendation into law. Ridge plans to approve the plan and
seek a legislative sponsor.

COSTLY RULE SETS MACT STANDARDS
FOR NEWER MUNICIPAL INCINERATORS


   Newer municipal waste combustors (MWCs) will be required
to install a combination of high-efficiency pollution-
control equipment starting Jan. 29, if an EPA final rule
does not draw significant negative comments. While the rule
enables EPA to reduce several pollutants, including lead,
simultaneously, it is expected to impose substantial capital
costs.

   The maximum achievable control technology standard will
affect existing and new MWCs capable of combusting more than
35 metric tons daily. It establishes emissions limits for
dioxins, furans, cadmium, lead, mercury, particulate matter,
hydrogen chloride, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and
fugitive ash. Stricter performance standards apply to MWCs
with capacities greater than 225 metric tons a day.

   The rule, published in the Dec. 19 Federal Register,
mandates that MWCs built after Sept. 20, 1994, or modified
after June 19, 1996, will be subject to new, more stringent
performance standards. MWCs built between Dec. 20, 1989 and
Sept. 20, 1994, or modified before June 19, 1996, will
remain subject to MWC performance standards for plants built
after the 1989 date. This provision was promulgated Feb. 11,
1991. The dates were set to avoid same MWC plants being
subject to overlapping rules.

   EPA says there are about 307 operating MWC units at 128
plants, providing a total combustion capacity of 94,000
metric tons per day. It says that 179 MWCs will be affected
by the rule; about 100 are publicly owned. Costs for the
updated standard exceed those for the 1991 standard by $156
million for capital investment and by $43 million for annual
operations. Total capital costs from investments mandated by
both rules approach $780 million, or an added $13 per metric
ton of solid waste combusted.

   The agency says the benefits include annual emissions
greater than the 1991 rule: 3,000 fewer metric tons of SO2
and 4,000 fewer metric tons of hydrogen chloride. For most
categories there is less than a 10 percent improvement, but
for mercury, the new standard will eliminate 200 percent of
the amount removed by the 1991 rule. In total, the rule
expects to reduce emissions of several hazardous air
pollutants by about 110,000 tons per year, EPA says.

   If a facility combusts less than 10 metric tons per day
of solid waste, regardless of capacity, it is exempted from
the rule. Tire-burning facilities are exempted from the
performance standard but not recordkeeping requirements. And
small independent-power producers, cogeneration facilities
and metals recovery facilities are not subject to the MWC
standards.

   The regulation, simultaneously released as a direct final
rule and a proposed rule, takes effect Jan 29 unless
significant adverse comments are received by Jan. 18. For
more information call Walter Stevenson, emission standards
division, (919) 541-5264.

LBP STUDIES POINT TO LACK OF RESEARCH
ON DANGERS FOR CONSTRUCTION WORKERS


   State and federal officials are not sufficiently
protecting construction workers from the hazardous effects
of lead-based paint (LBP), according to two studies. Each
report recommends officials pay greater attention to worker
safety as infrastructure repair work is performed on steel
structures and bridges.

   The two LBP studies were conducted separately by the
Alliance to End Childhood Lead Poisoning and by the New York
State Department of Health in conjunction with the Mount
Sinai Medical Center.

   Years of neglect and oversight have resulted in an
increased effort on infrastructure repair, Deborah Nagin,
industrial hygienist and researcher with the New York
Department of Health, told the annual convention of the
American Public Health Association (APHA). She said more
than 90 percent of these bridges and structures needing
repair are coated with LBP.

   In addition, state and federal authorities provide
minimal protection for workers who must repaint and repair
steel structures and bridges containing LBP, said Pierre
Erville, director of environmental and housing policy for
the Alliance to End Childhood Lead Poisoning, also speaking
at the APHA convention. The alliance is taking an active
interest in worker safety because it believes inadequate
safety practices on the job can spread lead contamination to
others.

Widespread State Effort Needed

   The two research efforts analyzed worker safety standards
in California, Connecticut, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland,
Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Texas and Washington.
Erville's alliance targeted the scientific procedures used
to prevent lead exposure, the rate of infrastructure repair
and the state of current occupational lead poisoning
prevention procedures.

   Only five states - Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York,
New Jersey and Maryland - have passed specific legislation
to protect workers from lead exposure, Erville said. He
pointed specifically to New York transportation authorities,
who require detailed reports on medical testing for workers
exposed to lead from contract bidders and who also require a
lead exposure control plan. The result of these protections
are that contractors bidding on construction projects will
not attempt to underbid a contract and then make up for the
financial loss by ignoring health and risk prevention
programs.

   Because most states do not have specific legislative
requirements on worker protection, the U.S. Department of
Transportation should take the lead in educating and
training state authorities on the risks of lead exposure,
Erville said. One method he suggested is a system where
contractors who bid on projects gather for "pre-bidding"
conferences where the specific level of lead content is made
known to help contractors make accurate bids and prepare for
the necessary level of worker protection.

   Erville also called upon state officials to: explicitly
list lead poisoning prevention provisions in their
contracts; consult with industrial hygienists with lead
prevention expertise; and ensure a level of contractor
training and worker training programs are developed and
implemented. He also urged that contractors be required to
establish a worker blood-lead level reporting system to be
submitted to state officials.

   Following up on that point, Nagin said many of these
types of requirements already exist. The specifics of the
rules and regulations, however, vary widely among states,
she said.

HAZWASTE-BURNING CEMENT KILN WAS
SOURCE OF LEAD IN BLOOD, STUDY SAYS


   A hazardous waste-burning cement kiln in Alpena, Mich.,
contributed 75 percent of the lead found in the blood of
nearby residents, according to researchers with Rutgers
University.

   In 18 of the 24 residents living near Lafarge Corp. and
whose blood was sampled, the levels of lead in blood were
the result of exposure from the cement kiln dust. The blood-
lead levels in most of the residents were under the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention's warning level of 10
micrograms per deciliter (ug/dl), though one resident showed
blood-lead levels of 11.87 ug/dl.

   The researchers said they aimed to trace where the lead
came from rather than the levels of lead the exposure
caused. The Association for Responsible Thermal Treatment -
a trade group of commercial hazardous waste incinerators who
compete with cement kilns in the waste burning market -
sponsored the study, performed by Gene Hall in Rutger's
chemistry department.

Seven Households Sampled

   The researchers used samples of people living in seven
households close to the Lafarge facility, with one other
household located farther away from the plant used as a
control. The study also collected samples of cement kiln
dust at Lafarge and samples of paint, tap water and house
dust from the sample households.

   Currently, cement kiln operators are allowed to store
piles of dust anywhere on their property. The Rutgers
conclusions could take on added importance as EPA still is
contemplating how and if cement kiln dust will be regulated.
In 1994, EPA sent a report to Congress recommending that in
some circumstances, cement kiln dust could be regulated
under Subtitle C regulations in the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act (RCRA).

   Most hazardous waste incinerators are fully permitted
under RCRA, with incinerator ash considered a hazardous
waste to be disposed of in Subtitle C landfills with triple
liners, ground water monitoring requirements and leachate
controls. EPA currently is working to unify emission limits
for hazardous waste incinerators and boilers and industrial
furnaces, which include cement kilns. A proposed rule that
accomplishes such a goal now is being reviewed by the White
House Office of Management and Budget.

BALTIMORE RESIDENTS FILE LAWSUIT OVER
FORTHCOMING LEAD-PAINT REGULATIONS


   Three Baltimore residents filed a class action suit this
month in a challenge against Maryland state lead-paint
regulations slated to take effect next month. The suit
argues the regulation favors landlords and will result in
child poisoning.

   The suit calls for an injunction prohibiting the Maryland
Department of the Environment from implementing and
enforcing its lead-paint removal and cleanup regulations,
which were adopted in November 1994 and scheduled to begin
Feb. 24. When passed, the law sought to prevent childhood
lead poisoning while being sensitive to the state's
decreasing supply of affordable housing. Disputes and
disagreements between childrens' advocates and property
owner representatives over how to implement the bill have
stalled it thus far.

   Joseph Espo, an attorney to the tenants who filed the
suit, said the way the forthcoming law is structured,
landlords would get immunity from lawsuits in the event a
child was poisoned in the lead abatement effort. Officials
from the Maryland Department of the Environment and the
Property Owners Association of Greater Baltimore declined to
comment on the suit. D. Robert Enten, with the Property
Owners Association, did say, however, that the legislation
in question seeks to strike a balance between the business
community, the maintenance of affordable housing and the
prevention of child lead poisoning.

   Landlords are willing to combat the lead problem, but
they also want protection from increasing numbers of
lawsuits filed by former tenants who claim their children
were poisoned. The property owners say this litigation will
soon drive them out of business with any controls.

   Under the bill, owners of pre-1950 rental housing must
reduce lead-poisoning risks on their properties by removing
and repainting surfaces that are flaking and peeling paint.
In return, the landlords would be immune from lawsuits if
any children living on the property become poisoned.

   The bill require landlords to follow some safety
precautions during abatement, and tenants may be forced to
vacate the unit while work is done. At issue, however, are
exemptions to the safety requirements when doing electrical
or plumbing work, or if repairs are performed on a painted
space in a room less than 25 square feet.
Fat Intake Could Increase Blood-Lead
Absorption in Children, Study Shows

   Children exposed to lead will absorb less of it if they
eat less fat, a new study suggests. Certain nutrients have
long been known to affect the rate at which the body takes
up lead, which can retard children's development, lower
their IQs and damage their hearing, according to
researchers.

   In a study of 296 inner-city preschoolers, 9 months to 3
years old, the researchers found that those with high levels
of fat in their diet were more likely to have dangerous
levels of lead in their blood. Dietary calcium and iron are
known to block lead absorption, but the effects of many
other nutrients have not been explored. The researchers also
learned that poor children are the most likely to be
exposed.

   The researchers said if further study supports their
findings, it "would further strengthen the recommendation of
a low-fat diet as a healthy one for children." Federal
health officials recommend no restrictions on fats for
children under 2 because it might harm their growth.

   Lead levels among the children ranged from 1 to 55
micrograms per tenth of a liter of blood, and averaged about
11. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says
anything above 10 can cause lead poisoning in children. The
quantities of fat in the children's diets were not
estimated; the researchers used only relative intakes based
on questions asked of parents.

Calories May Increase Absorption

   The study also found that higher levels of calories - not
just fat - were associated with higher lead absorption.
However, this point is disputed by a longtime lead
researcher, who expressed doubt that higher calorie intake
is linked to higher lead absorption.

   Kim Dietrich, a developmental psychologist at the
University of Cincinnati School of Medicine who has studied
lead for 15 years, said lead is more readily absorbed on an
empty stomach. That is one reason doctors see higher lead
levels among poor children, he said. He agreed, however,
that higher fat consumption is related to higher lead
levels, possibly because the fat increases absorption of
lead in the intestine.

   The research was led by Susan Lucas of the Department of
Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine at the University of
Maryland School of Medicine. The findings are reported in
the January issue of the journal Pediatrics, published by
the American Academy of Pediatrics.

   Lucas warned children can be exposed to lead through
dust, dirt and drinking water, along with toys and houses
painted before 1975, the last year lead-based paint was
used. Water can be contaminated if it flows through lead
pipes, and children may eat paint flakes or inhale or lick
lead dust, which tastes sweet.

BLOOD-LEAD MONITOR IN CONNECTICUT
MAY BE APPLIED WITHIN OTHER STATES


   A program to monitor levels of lead in blood in
Connecticut that also includes worker protection measures
has been so successful in lowering blood-lead levels that
efforts are underway to expand the program to other states,
according to a report in the Dec. 15 issue of Morbidity and
Mortality Weekly Report, published by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

   The program, the Connecticut Road Industry Surveillance
Project (CRISP), began in 1990 in an effort to reduce lead
exposure, contamination and toxicity in bridge workers in
the state. In order to comply with the program, contracts
must carry health and safety language, and medical
management of workers with centralized data reporting and
intervention is required.

   The CDC report shows, by contrast, that blood-lead levels
continue to afflict bridge workers even in states with
regulatory lead requirements and workplace safety and health
standards. Among bridge workers from eight states, a quarter
had levels of blood lead above 40 micrograms of lead per
deciliter of blood.

   Connecticut, however, had only 2 percent of workers with
elevated blood-lead levels, which owes to the state's worker
protection measures incorporated into road construction
contracts, the CDC report said.

DAMNING DOCUMENTS SINK OCF
AS FIRM'S APPEAL FALLS SHORT


   Documents are critical to successful litigation against
asbestos manufacturers. The paper trail often leads to the
all-important answers to the questions of what did the
company know of the dangers of their product and when they
knew it.

   A case in point concerns asbestos giant Owens-Corning
Fiberglass Corp. (OCF), which recently appealed a judgment
by arguing in vain that the trial court should have excluded
damaging documents about the company. Three men who suffered
asbestos-related diseases after exposure to OCF products
received a total of $3 million in compensatory damages and
$500,000 each in punitive damages due to the company's
failure to warn them of asbestos' hazards.

   The documents that led to the verdict included since-
declassified Navy reports from World War II detailing the
dangers of asbestos as well as internal OCF communications.
In its appeal, OCF said the court improperly admitted these
documents. OCF argued the Navy reports should have been
excluded from trial because - as classified documents - the
company could not have known the findings they contained.

   As for the company memoranda, OCF said the plaintiffs had
altered their copies to highlight damaging statements to
inflame the jury. However, the Texas Court of Appeals in
Houston Jan. 4 rejected OCF's argument, saying the company
had access to the same information in the Navy reports and
knew the contents of its own corporate memoranda.

Navy Documents Admitted

   The court also noted that, in a failure-to-warn case,
what the company knows of its product's dangers is sometimes
less relevant than what other experts in the field know. "It
does not matter whether a manufacturer was aware of
information regarding the dangers of asbestos use at the
time of exposure and marketing because an asbestos
manufacturer is charged with the duty to know the dangers of
asbestos products," the court ruled. "If the dangers of
asbestos were known by other manufacturers or by the Navy at
or before the time of the plaintiffs' exposure, the same
risks were scientifically discoverable by OCF."

   In any event, the internal OCF documents introduced at
trial indicated OCF had information - at about the same time
the Navy did - on the hazards of asbestos, the court said.
"As early as the 1940s, OCF had in its files documentation
about shipyard insulation workers who had developed
asbestosis," the court said. "It had copies of public health
bulletins about the effect of inhalation of asbestos dust.
In letters to OCF, doctors conducting tests on Fiberglass
repeatedly made reference to the dangers of asbestos."

   OCF cited markings on the plaintiff's exhibit and argued
the trial court had improperly admitted into evidence
doctored copies. However, the Texas appeals court agreed
with the trial court that the markings - if indeed the
plaintiff made them - were harmless.

Court Admits Photocopies

   "The documents about which OCF complains are
photocopies," the appeals court said. "OCF does not assert
that the photocopies do not accurately reproduce the
originals; instead, it complains about marks made on
duplicates after reproduction .... However, we have reviewed
the documents and we agree that the markings on the
documents are not significant."

   The Navy report and OCF documents were only a sampling of
the documents the plaintiffs brought to trial on asbestos.
Much of the damning evidence that had been allowed at trial
was struck from the record before jury deliberations. For
example, the plaintiffs introduced the testimony of a Dr.
Irving Selikoff at an Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) hearing in 1984. "The asbestos disease
disaster which we now face largely unsuccessfully bears
witness to our failures," Selikoff said. "We have
consistently greatly underestimated or ignored warnings of
disease and death."

   Saying the testimony should have been excluded as
hearsay, the trial judge told the jury to disregard
Selikoff's testimony before OSHA. OCF urged the judge to
declare a mistrial, arguing there was no way for the jury to
ignore such testimony. The judge rejected the company's
request, and the appeals court agreed that the instruction
to the jury to ignore the testimony was sufficient. [Owens-
Corning Fiberglass Corp. v. Malone, 1996 WL 3563

NEWSBRIEFS


   Paint Contamination Control - The Institute of
Environmental Sciences seeks voting members for Working
Group (WG-029) in its Contamination Control Division, which
is writing a Recommended Practice (RP) on "Contamination
Control Considerations in Paint Spray Applications." A
"home-stretch" draft will be issued for discussion at the
institute's annual technical meeting May 12-17, in Orlando,
Fla. The RP is intended to provide guidelines for controlled
paint spray environments and related operations. The goal is
to establish a uniform basis for describing, procuring,
operating and testing as these relate to paint and coatings,
air handling, surface cleaning and preparation, paint-
related consumables, personnel garment systems and related
laundering, facility cleaning, paint-delivery systems, and
environmental considerations. "The diversification of
backgrounds and experience in the working group membership
has been a key element," said Charles Berndt, working group
chair. "The cross-pollination of ideas that are brought to
the table...has led to the quick progress on this RP." For
more information, call the Institute of Environmental
Sciences, (708) 255-1561.

   Demolishing Suit - A couple living in Arapahoe County,
Colo., have filed a lawsuit in district court saying
asbestos particles were blown over their home during
demolition of a building located next to them. Kathleen
Collins and Theodore Singer named FTSC Partnership,
developer of the Polo Reserve now being constructed in place
of the building; Randall & Blake Inc., the demolition firm;
and the city of Littleton, Colo., which the suit says
permitted the demolition. Singer and Collins argue in their
suit that a crew demolished the building in June during
windy weather. The incident threatened the couple's health
and caused emotional distress, the suit said.


   Lead Contract Award - Versar Inc., Sprinfield, Va., was
awarded with three contracts with a combined potential value
of $1.5 million. The contracts include a $600,000 two-year
contract with the Federal Highway Administration to assess
containment efficiency in environmental exposure from lead
paint removal and maintenance on bridges. The second
contract, worth $700,000, is to provide a variety of
infrastructure deism services to Leigh City, Utah. The third
contract, for $100,000, was with the state of California's
Division of State Architect Seismic upgrade program.


   Quality Control - The American Society for Testing and
Materials (ASTM) is preparing to release a draft standard
for institutions to use for certifying environmental
professionals. Once the standard is approved, only about 25
percent of the nation's approximately 130 credentialing
institutions are expected to pass muster. The credentialing
guidelines, the result of nearly two years of work, will be
circulated to members of ASTM's subcommittee on
environmental credentialing and ultimately to all ASTM
members. The model for the standards effort is the Council
of Engineering and Scientific Study Boards, said Anthony
Buonicore, chairman of the task force developing the
standards. The draft standard states it "does not propose to
address any specific certification program for environmental
professionals." It does, however, specify criteria for
credentialing organizations. Contact: ASTM, (215) 299-5400.


   Directory - The National Conference of State Legislators
(NCSL) has issued a new listing of who in the states is
leading various lead-poisoning prevention activities. Lead
Poisoning Prevention: Directory of State Contacts costs $20
plus shipping, and can be ordered through NCSL's Marketing
Department: (303) 830-2200.

New Instrumentation Detects Toxic Gases

GMD Systems, Inc. (Old Route 519, Hendersonville, PA 15339; Tel
412/746-3600 or 800/736-4666, Fax 412/746-1359) has commercialized
its Remote Intelligent Sensor (RIS) for the detection of toxic
gases such as hydrazines, phosgene, and isocyanates.  William T.
Hughes, Product Manager, told us that the RIS is a highly accurate,
single point, fixed position area monitor expandable into a network
of up to 120 sensors connected by a 2-way communications link, and
computer-supervised from a central location.  Since each RIS also
retains "stand alone" capability, the units can continue to operate
during power outages or computer failures.  The RIS employs a
quick-response, microprocessor-controlled sensing system that uses
a combination of colorimetric paper tape, cassettes, and electro-
optics.  GMD is an affiliate of Bacharach, Inc. (625 Alpha Drive,
Pittsburgh, PA 15238; Tel 412/963-2000, Fax 412/963-2091).

Sierra Monitor Gas Sensors Employ Four Sensing Technologies

Sierra Monitor Corporation (SMC, 1991 Tarob Court, Milpitas, CA
95035; Tel 408/262-6611, Fax 408/262-9042) offers 4 sensor
technologies to match the best gas sensor performance with
application requirements.  Catalytic bead sensors are used to
monitor combustible gases.  The sensor provides reliable zero
stability and a linear response to combustible gas over a wide
temperature range.  The sensor consists of 2 alumina beads each
surrounding a platinum wire operating at approximately 450 C.  One
bead is passivated so it will not react with combustible gas.  The
other bead is catalyzed to promote a reaction with combustible gas.
Effects of changes in ambient temperature and relative humidity are
nullified by placing the two beads in separate legs of a wheatstone
bridge circuit.  When the catalyzed bead reacts with the
combustible gas, it heats up, which increases its resistance.
This, in turn, increases the output of the wheatstone bridge
circuit used as the sensor signal.

Stephen R. Ferree, Vice President - Marketing, told us that SMC's
semiconductor sensors have a resistance in air which is affected by
oxygen adsorbed on the surface of the sensor.  Oxygen atoms capture
electrons on the semiconductor surface, thereby increasing its
resistance.  The sensors may be impregnated with dopants such that,
when the sensor's resistance changes, specific gases displace the
adsorbed oxygen.  For example, SMC's thin film metal oxide sensor
does not respond when exposed to 5% methane in air.  Other
semiconductor sensors are available for combustible gases, carbon
monoxide, and ammonia.

Electrochemical sensors are fuel cell-like devices consisting of an
anode, cathode, and electrolyte.  The components of the cell are
selected so that a subject gas allowed to diffuse into the cell
will cause a chemical reaction and generate a current.  The cells
are diffusion limited so the rate at which the gas enters the cell
is solely dependent on the gas concentration.  The current
generated is proportional to the rate of consumption of the subject
gas in the cell.  Unlike electrochemical sensors, where gas
diffuses through membranes into the cell, SMC sensors allow gas to
diffuse into the sensor through a simple capillary.  The result is
a stable sensor with low pressure and temperature coefficients and
the capability to measure gas as a % by volume.

In SMC infrared (IR) sensors, gas molecules absorb IR light within
a narrow, characteristic wavelength.  Light is emitted from an IR
source and passed through the gas to be analyzed.  The amount of
absorption corresponds directly to the gas concentration.

SMC gas sensor modules condition the sensor signal and provide an
industry standard 4-20 mA output that can interface with single-
and multiple-channel controllers and distributed control systems.
Gases monitored by SMC modules include ammonia, carbon dioxide,
carbon monoxide, chlorine, combustible gases, hydrogen, hydrogen
sulfide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, oxygen, and sulfur
dioxide.

HNU Systems Uses Photoionization to Measure Gases

HNU Systems, Inc. (160 Charlemont St., Newton, MA 02161-9987; Tel
617/964-6690 800/724-5600, Fax 617/558-0056) Model 201 continuous
gas monitors allow the long term monitoring of volatile organic
compounds (VOC's).  Brian Sheppard, National Sales Manager, told us
that the instruments are suited for the continuous measurement of
process streams, stack gas, or ambient air.  They use the
photoionization detection principle, which provides measurements
accurate to sub parts per million (ppm) levels.  The instruments
can often measure over a range of 0.1 ppm to 2000 ppm, with higher
ranges available upon request.  An ultra-stable, sealed ultraviolet
(UV) light source used as an ionization source, plus electronic
circuitry, provide instrument stability and repeatability.  Also
unusual is the mechanical simplicity of these photoionization
instruments (the meter movement and the sampling pump are the only
moving parts) which helps to ensure stability.  By employing the
photoionization detection principle, the Model 201 instruments
eliminate other problems common to older techniques.  There are no
optics, lenses, or mirrors involved, which eliminates periodic
alignment and coating.  There are no flames that can go out nor any
flow regulators  needed, since photoionization is independent of
flow, and there are no compressed gases required for operation.

Photoionization analyzers can be used to monitor a wide variety of
organic and some inorganic gases.  Aromatics, ketones, chlorinated
hydrocarbons, hydrogen sulfide, reduced sulfur compounds,
phosphine, ammonia, iodine, and hydrazine are among the gases which
can be measured.  The photoionization principle of operation
includes the absorption of UV light by a molecule which leads to
ionization via: R + hn  = R+ + e- where R+ is the ionized species
and hn represents a photon which has an energy greater than the
ionization potential of the species.  The sensor consists of a
sealed UV light source that emits photons which are energetic
enough to ionize many trace species (particularly organics) but do
not ionize the major components of air such as oxygen, nitrogen,
carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and water.  A chamber adjacent to
the UV source contains a pair of electrodes.  When a positive
potential is applied to one electrode, the created field drives any
ions formed by the absorption of UV light to the collector
electrode where the current (proportional to the concentration) is
measured.

Air Instruments & Measurements' Model 8000 Can Measure Up to 6
Gases in Real Time

Air Instruments & Measurements, Inc. (AIM, 13111 Brooks Dr. Suite
D, Baldwin Park, CA 91706-7901; Tel 818/813-1460 or 800/969-4AIM,
Fax 818/338-2585) has introduced its Model 8000 open-path analyzer
to measure up to 6 gases in real time across an extended (100 feet
or more) path length.  Raj Adani, National Sales Manager, told us
that the system is based on the company's double-pass optical
system which features automatic self-calibration with an internal
reference mirror and sealed gas cells and/or bandpass filters for
a known up-scale response.  The system is mounted in a sealed,
double-ended enclosure, and the sensor assembly includes a
thermostatted heater for weather protection.  Optional cooling is
also available.  The retroreflector end is passive, with no
electrical or moving parts, eliminating the need for thermal or
explosion protection.  AIM says the system is particularly well
suited for the detection of leaks and spills of hazardous, toxic,
corrosive, and/or condensable gases since it measures the sample in
place in the air with no sample contact.  Measurable gases include
HF, HCl, HCOH, benzene, toluene, vinyl chloride, CH4, NO, N2O, SO2,
CO, CO2, NH3, HCN, and water.

Legislated Acid Rain Requirements Will Reduce Fine  Particulate
Emissions

EPA, Congress and environmentalists will be pleasantly surprised to
learn that the scrubbers being installed to reduce acid rain will
also reduce fine particulate air pollution by 20,000 to 40,000 tons
per year.  These conclusions are contained in a new report issued
by the McIlvaine Company (Northbrook, IL) entitled  Heavy Metal
Removal from Coal-Fired Boilers .

There is renewed concern that fine particulate is the most serious
air pollution problem.  The utility industry is the largest
stationary source emitter.  The old coal-fired plants are not
regulated as to particulate emissions by any federal laws.  The new
SO2 reduction requirements for these plants allow either fuel
switching or scrubbers.  Scrubbers capture 80% of the fine
particulate (not captured by the precipitators) along with the SO2.
Most utilities are fuel switching in Phase 1, so this impressive
fine particulate reduction will be accomplished by only 15,000 MW
of scrubbers.

Scrubbers have the further benefit of removing air toxics.
Scrubbers would also remove 20,000 to 60,000 tons per year of
chlorine and 7000 to 8000 tons per year of fluorine.  The scrubbers
would also remove the toxic heavy metals which are measured in
pounds per year instead of tons per year.  The scrubbers would
remove 12,000 to 36,000 pounds/year of mercury and 13,000 to 42,000
pounds of chromium.  Even greater quantities of lead and manganese
would be captured.  Equal or smaller quantities of arsenic,
selenium, cadmium and other toxics would also be removed.

Liquid Fuels from Coal-Derived Synthesis Gas

Coal-derived syngas can be converted to methanol using liquid phase
methanol synthesis (LPMeOH) process.  Methanol can be further
converted to gasoline using the Mobil methanol-to-gasoline (MTG)
process.  The combination of syngas-to-methanol technology with the
MTG process thus provides a ready synthetic route for liquid
hydrocarbon fuels.  Sunggyu Lee and Conrad F. Kulik (Department of
Chemical Engineering, The University of Akron, Akron, OH 44325)
have developed a process for one-step synthesis of dimethyl ether
(DME) from syngas.  This DME process improves the reactor
productivity and syngas conversion by as much as 100% over the
LPMeOH process.  One-step DME synthesis is thus an ideal front end
for further conversion to gasoline.  This substitution is justified
not only because DME yields an identical product distribution as
methanol, but DME is also a true intermediate in the MTG process.
The integration scheme has been termed the dimethyl  ether-to-
gasoline (DTG) process.  The advantages of the UA/EPRI process over
the conventional MTG process are in enhanced syngas conversion,
superior hydrocarbon yield and selectivity, and integrated energy
efficiency.  The researchers summarized their work in a paper
delivered at the 206th American Chemical Society (ACS) National
Meeting in Chicago, IL August 22-27, 1993.

Biodiesel Offers Environmental and Economic Advantages

Biodiesel fuel is produced by esterifying vegetable oils or animal
fats by reacting them with methanol in the presence of a catalyst
to produce methyl ester.  Its major attraction, besides its reduced
emissions characteristics, is its ease of use.  As opposed to
natural gas or electric power, biodiesel fuel can power existing
diesel engines with no modifications.  The Comprehensive National
Energy Policy Act of 1992 raised the expectations of the industry
since it redefined and broadened the term "alternative" fuel to
include any fuel "substantially not petroleum."

In May 1993, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
provisionally approved petitions to register methyl soyate and
methyl tallowate as motor fuels and fuel additives permitting their
sale in that capacity.  Final approval depends upon research
demonstrating that methyl soyate and methyl tallowate are
"substantially similar" to diesel fuel.  While biodiesel fuel
reduces carbon dioxide, hydrocarbon, and particulate emissions, it
is an oxygenated fuel and, accordingly, increases nitrous oxide
emissions.  Some industry sources expect EPA to consider each
emissions category separately instead of evaluating it for its
aggregate emissions reduction capability.  Such a decision could
jeopardize biodiesel's "substantially similar" designation.

The American Biofuels Association (ABA) expects mass transit to
provide most biodiesel activity over the next 5 or so years as EPA
urban fleet emissions requirements take effect in January 1995.
Since biodiesel is priced at $2.50-3.00/gallon, the ABA is pushing
for tax exemptions and credits at both the federal and state levels
to make the fuel competitive with conventional diesel fuel and
ethanol and bio-based methanol.  The ABA estimates that 3.4 billion
gallons of biodiesel could be produced annually in the U.S., which
would place land now idled by agricultural subsidies back into
production.  Excess soybean oil and yellow grease stocks would also
be utilized.

Waste Incineration Technology Produces Syngas

The Thermoselect waste incineration process gasifies unsorted
municipal solid waste (MSW) to produce syngas,  which is scrubbed
and fired in a conventional gas engine to generate electricity.
This results in significantly less waste gas emissions than in
traditional MSW incinerators, claims developer Thermoselect S.A.
(Locarno, Switzerland).  A demonstration plant at Verbania, Italy
has been operating at 100 metric tons/day of MSW and generating a
net positive balance of 300 kW.  Emissions per metric ton of waste
burned are lower than the proposed European Community (EC)
emissions standard, with actual emissions of 90 kg of hydrogen
chloride and 1 kg each of dust, hydrogen fluoride, mercury, and
cadmium.  The volume of unsorted waste is first reduced by a factor
of 10 in a conventional press.  The compressed waste is then fed
into a 600 C coking oven, where metals and inorganic substances
form a solid matrix with the charred organics.  Following a
residence time of 1-2 hours, the solid matrix is fed directly to a
gasifier at 2000 C to convert the organics to syngas and to liquefy
the inorganics and metals.  Each metric ton of MSW yields 30 kg of
recyclable metal, 250 kg of vitrified slag, and 600 kg of syngas.

Quantum Considers Increasing Methanol Production

Quantum Chemical Corp. (99 Park Ave., New York, NY 10016; Tel
212/949-5000) has taken its LaPorte, TX methanol plant off the
market.  The unit, which has a capacity of 200 million
gallons/year, is operating at only 100 million gallons/year due
mainly to a shortage of hydrogen feedstock.  The company says the
move is unrelated to its pending acquisition by Hanson PLC (1
Grosvenor Pl., London SW1X 7JH, England).  The company is studying
options to increase the output of the plant to respond to a
perceived increase in demand for methanol stemming from oxygenated
gasoline requirements.

Ceramic Engine Fueled by Methanol

A compact, low polluting ceramic engine which runs on methanol has
been designed by the Kanagawa Academy of Science and Technology
Foundation (3-2-1 Sakado, Takatsu-ku, Kawasaki City, Kanagawa Pref.
213, Japan; Tel +81 44 819 2043, Fax +81 44 819 2027).  It is
claimed to be about 30% more fuel efficient and to perform
similarly to a comparable diesel engine.  The prototype engine has
4 cylinders and a displacement of 2000 cc.  It occupies about 20%
less space than a diesel engine in the same class and weighs about
150 kg.  It is air cooled and can withstand temperature differences
of 800 C between the interior and exterior surfaces of the
cylinders.

Allied-Signal Increases the Production of CFC Alternatives

Allied-Signal (Box 2245, Morristown, NJ 07962; Tel 201/455-2000)
has completed a 6-month expansion program at its El Segundo, CA
facility as part of a $250 million investment in the development
and commercialization of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) replacements.
The company has doubled its annual capacity to 50 million pounds,
for hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC)-141b, which is used as a
replacement for CFC-11 as a blowing agent in insulating foams.
HCFC-141b is also used in new Allied-Signal specialty solvents.

The company expects to start full-scale commercial production of
Genetron AZ-50, a mixture of hydrofluorocarbon (HFC)-125 and (HFC)-
143a, at its Baton Rouge, LA facility in June 1994.  Allied-Signal
has also received Underwriters Laboratories (UL) approval of the
product, certifying it for use with UL-approved equipment.
Genetron AZ-50 is a replacement for the refrigerant R-502, a
mixture of CFC-115 and HCFC-22.

AT&T and Chrysler to Eliminate CFC Usage

Chrysler Corporation (12000 Chrysler Dr., Highland Park, MI 48288;
Tel 313/956-5741, Fax 313/956-1462) says that it will eliminate
chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-12 refrigerant from air conditioning
systems in all Chrysler-built vehicles by January 1, 1994, two
years ahead of Federal mandates and faster than previously
announced.  "We've moved as aggressively as possible in removing R-
12 from our product line, and we believe our rapid deployment of
air conditioning systems using R-134a is in the best interests of
our customers and the environment," said Ronald R. Boltz,
Chrysler's Vice-President for Product Strategy and Regulatory
Affairs.  Chrysler reports that it is already using 134a on more
than 750,000 of its 1993 model year cars, the most of any automaker
selling vehicles in the U.S.  In addition to efforts on new cars,
Chrysler says that it is taking steps to help consumers with older
cars.  It is developing a CFC-free "drop-in" substitute with
Intermagnetics General Corporation (Box 566, Guilderland, NY 12084;
Tel 518/456-5456), which it says looks promising based on
preliminary data.

Separately, AT&T (550 Madison Ave., New York, NY 10022; Tel
212/605-5500) says that it has ended the use of all Class 1 ozone-
depleting materials from its consumer and business manufacturing
operations.  In 1986 AT&T's manufacturing operations emitted 2.5
million pounds of CFC's.

Disagreement Surfaces over HCFC and Methyl Bromide Bans

European proposals for controlling ozone-depleting
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC's) and methyl bromide have provoked
disagreement from several companies and countries.  The proposals,
which were finalized on June 9, 1993, are undergoing examination by
European experts.  These proposals stipulate the banning of HCFC's
by 2015 and a production and usage freeze on methyl bromide
starting January 1, 1996.  France, the only European Community (EC)
country where methyl bromide is produced, is anxious to protect its
industry and is unwilling to apply measures more stringent than
those of the Montreal Protocol.

The major corporate opposition in France stems from Elf Atochem
(Paris, France), Europe's only methyl bromide producer.  The
company is participating in a $400,000 program to develop
technology to prevent emissions of the gas, which is used primarily
as a soil fumigant.  Elf Atochem's 1990 methyl bromide production
was 5000 metric tons; European consumption of 14,000 metric tons
was met by imports from the U.S. and Israel.  Worldwide methyl
bromide production is about 65,000 metric tons per year.  The U.S.
plans to ban methyl bromide in 2000.  Accordingly, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is granting accelerated
reviews to methyl bromide alternatives.

Southern EC member countries Spain, Portugal, and Greece also
oppose the HCFC phaseout part of the plan.  Belgium, which has
minor reservations, supports the plan, along with Italy, the U.K.,
and Ireland.  Denmark, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Germany
want an even faster HCFC phaseout.

U.S. CFC Users Seek Exemptions

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has received about
20 requests from chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) users seeking exemption
from the ban on the production of the ozone-depleting chemicals
which is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 1996.  When they
voted in November 1992 to accelerate the phaseout of CFC's, the
parties to the Montreal Protocol On Substances That Deplete the
Ozone Layer included provisions for exemptions for essential uses.
Each country must formally nominate potential exempt uses to a
United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) technical review
committee.  By its July 19, 1993 deadline, EPA had received 5
requests for exemptions for medical devices and 3 for refrigeration
or air conditioning uses, according to Nina Bonnelycke of EPA's
Substitutes Analysis and Review Branch.  Other exemption requests
were for the use of CFC's in analytical tests, as leak detectors
for nuclear submarines and power plants, in adhesives, in a wasp
killer, and in the manufacture of small caliber ammunition.  The
EPA will convene an interagency review group to decide which
applications warrant forwarding to UNEP.  In order to receive an
exemption, petitioners must demonstrate that the  use of CFC's is
critical to the functioning of society; that no alternatives are
technically, economically, or legally viable; and that no recycled
CFC's are available.

Ceramic-Based Catalysts Reduce NOx Emissions

Cormetech, Inc. (Treyburn Corporate Park, 5000 International Drive,
Durham, NC 27712; Tel 919/620-3000, Fax 919/620-3001) produces
ceramic-based extruded honeycomb catalysts for nitrogen oxide (NOx)
removal from coal-, oil-, or gas-fired stationary combustion
systems, such as utility and industrial boilers and gas turbines.
End users include electric utilities, petroleum refiners, and
chemical producers.  The homogeneous, titania-based, selective
catalytic reduction (SCR) catalysts resist heat and chemical
attack.  In the SCR process, ammonia is injected into the flue gas,
where it reacts with NOx in the presence of the catalyst to form
nitrogen and water.  SCR systems have no moving parts and produce
no by-products.  When used in SCR systems at 400-1000 F, they can
remove more than 90% of NOx emissions.  The honeycomb structure of
Cormetech's high surface area titanium dioxide catalysts maximizes
catalytic activity while minimizing gas flow resistance.  Each
catalyst element is 150 mm square and can be provided in lengths up
to 1000 mm.  Variations in catalyst composition and cellular
structure are determined by the nature of each application,
especially the type of fuel being burned.  Catalysts are engineered
for each application to minimize erosion and exposure to plugging.

Gerhard F. Koenig, President and CEO, says that Cormetech can
simulate flue gas conditions, including space and linear velocity
relationships, at its in-house pilot testing facilities.  Bench-
scale "micro-test" reactors are part of the company's resources for
use in catalyst manufacturing process control or when limited
representative sampling is needed.  Flow modeling technology is
also available from Cormetech and permits gas flow simulation of
conditions encountered in the plant, including conditions in the
reactor itself.  Flow modeling options include cold flow techniques
as well as computer modeling.  The company can perform and
recommend system design modifications such as installation of
static mixers, vanes, and other devices to reduce gas flow
variations.  Reducing variations optimizes the efficiency of the
catalyst while preventing erosion and plugging, i.e., information
derived from the flow modeling permits "conditioning" of the flue
gas before it reaches the catalyst to optimize catalyst
performance.  The company delivered catalysts during the summer of
1993 for the U.S.'s first large utility retrofit using SCR
technology.  The project involved 2 power plants in southern
California.  Cormetech was formed in 1989 by Corning, Inc.

Air Products Unveils NOx and N2O Reduction Technologies

Research scientists at Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (7201
Hamilton Boulevard, Allentown, PA 18195-1501; Tel 215/481-4911)
have discovered two catalytic technologies to reduce industrial
pollution.  One of the technologies reduces nitrogen oxides (NOx)
emissions from stationary and mobile sources, while the other
prevents nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from certain chemical
processes from entering the atmosphere.

The NOx technology employs metal-exchanged zeolite catalysts, along
with methane in an oxygen-rich atmosphere, to convert NOx to
nitrogen gas, carbon oxides, and water.  The company says that the
process offers an environmentally and potentially economically
attractive alternative to currently available NOx removal
technology that uses ammonia for reducing emissions from stationary
sources, such as industrial boilers or natural gas-fueled power
stations.  Methane used in the Air Products process is already
available at many facilities which emit NOx, and their NOx-
containing exhaust streams typically contain high levels of oxygen.
Air Products' John N. Armor said that the technology may also lead
to improved catalysts for removing NOx from mobile engine
emissions.

The company's technology for removing N2O emissions from off-gases
of certain chemical processes uses a different family of metal
loaded zeolite catalysts that decompose N2O into its benign
components, gaseous nitrogen and oxygen.  These catalysts are said
to be long-lived and stable over a broad (200-800 C) temperature
range.  In addition, some of the catalysts readily destroy N2O in
the presence of water vapor.  Air Products' Yuejin Li said that
these characteristics make the technology especially suitable for
the clean-up of off-gases from major sources of N2O emissions
formed during the manufacture of nitric acid and nylon-66.  Since
the "industrial revolution" began, the concentration of N2O in the
atmosphere has been steadily increasing about 0.2% per year.
Because the gas has an atmospheric lifetime of about 150 years, the
need exists to develop a commercially viable process for its
decomposition.

Technology Reviewed for Catalytic NOx Reduction

A large amount of equipment is in operation which uses ammonia in
V2O5-TiO2-W(Mo)O2 system (the selective catalytic reduction, or
SCR, method) to remove high temperature nitrogen oxides (NOx) from
generating sources, such as boilers and incinerators.  In these
systems, even when oxygen of high concentration is present, ammonia
reacts selectively with the nitrogen oxide (NO) and the reaction is
accelerated.  A conventional SCR process uses V2O5-TiO2 as the
catalyst.

Some European systems using zeolites are in operation, with about
50% applied on diesel engines.  This equipment is said to have
several advantages, including operation over a broad temperature
range (300-480 C), the ability to use either 25% ammonia solution
or pure ammonia gas as the reducing agent, the use of monolithic
ceramic catalysts containing no heavy metals, the absence of
sulfuric acid generation due to the low oxidizing capacity of SO2,
the storage capacity of NH3 and NOx is large enough to withstand
partial pressure fluctuations, and long catalyst life.

All SCR processes use ammonia to react with NO.  Problems of
untreated ammonia are being addressed by a research group at
Japan's Hokkaido University.  The group is evaluating a process
which uses hydrocarbons as reducing agents.  Their research is
fully described in the Japanese High Technology Monitor, Vol. 11,
No. 10.

Goal Line Environmental Technologies Introduces NOx and CO
Reduction Process

Goal Line Environmental Technologies (GLET, Box 58324, 2045 East
Vernon Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90058; Tel 213/233-2224, Fax
213/233-7428) has filed a patent application for its SCONOx
technology.  GLET President Robert Danziger told us that the SCONOx
process cost effectively reduces nitrogen oxide (NOx) and carbon
monoxide (CO) to below measurable levels at natural gas-fired power
plants.  The technology oxidizes nitric oxide (NO) to nitrogen
dioxide (NO2), which is then absorbed and recycled into the power
plant's engine.  GLET is a co-venture of Sunlaw Energy Corporation
(Los Angeles, CA) and Advanced Catalyst Systems (Knoxville, TN).
Sunlaw, which operates two of the ten largest power plants in the
Los Angeles basin, plans to install a full-scale SCONOx system by
the end of 1993 and a second system in June 1994.

Catalyst-Coated Panels Can Reduce NOx Levels

High-rise buildings and sound barriers lining highways may act as
scavengers of 20% of such "greenhouse" gases as nitrogen oxides
(NOx) if the walls and sidings are coated with a mixture of
titanium oxide, activated carbon, and a  small amount of iron (III)
oxide.  In laboratory-scale tests at Japan's National Institute for
Resources and Environment (NIRE, Tsukuba, Ibaraki Pref., Japan),
panels coated with such catalysts have removed more than 90% of NOx
from a 0.05 parts per million (ppm) stream under irradiation,
equivalent to conditions on a cloudy day, by near-ultraviolet
light.  Nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are oxidized
by TiO2 to NO2 and NO3-, respectively.  The activated carbon
component serves to fix the NO-derived NO2 so that it can be
further oxidized to NO3-.  In practice, rain water will wash the
NO3- off the panels.  In a country with Japan's level of rainfall
(1.5 m annually), only a slight decrease in the pH of any runoff,
equivalent to about 10 ppm, is expected, according to NIRE.  A 5-
year project to develop a viable technology began in April 1993.

Alumina Catalyst Aids Low Temperature NOx Reduction

Cosmo Oil Co. Ltd. (1-1 Shibaura 1-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo 105,
Japan; Tel 03-798-3211) has succeeded in keeping nitrogen oxides
(NOx) particles from diesel engine exhaust to less than 100 parts
per million (ppm) for more than 2000 hours by utilizing a honeycomb
alumina catalyst and alcohol as the reducing agent.  The company
considers this an important first step in the practical use of the
technology for the difficult job of controlling NOx emissions in
the presence of high-concentrations of oxygen.  Cosmo plans to
continue the research and testing in an effort to raise the under
100 ppm time interval from 2000 to 4000 hours.  The company also
has targeted the 200kW diesel engine of a cogeneration system for
demonstration testing.  The technology features low temperature
(300-400 C) NOx removal to minimize the deterioration of the
catalyst due to steam.  Sakai Chemical Industry Co. (Ebisujima-cho
5-chome, Sakai City, Osaka Pref. 590, Japan; Tel 0722-23-4111) and
several diesel engine manufacturers are also participating in the
test work.  The technology was first developed by Japan's National
Institute of Materials and Chemical Research and its Petroleum
Energy Center.

Pulp and Paper Process Reduces Sulfur and Chlorine Emissions

Formic acid and hydrogen peroxide replace sulfur- and chlorine-
based compounds in the cooking and bleaching steps of a pulp and
paper process under development by Kemira Oy (Helsinki, Finland).
The driving forces behind the Milox technology have been
legislative mandates in Europe and the U.S. to reduce chlorine
emissions from wastewater and to remove sulfur compounds from waste
gases.  The Milox process is in operation in a 150 kg/h pilot plant
and, says the company, could be in operation in a 5000-10,000
metric tons/year demonstration plant by 1995.  Lignin, the gum that
binds the cellulose fibers in wood, is removed by reaction with
hydroxonium ions (H3O+) in 3 stages.  The first and last stages are
carried out at 80 C in a solution of 80 wt % peroxyacetic acid,
formed by the reaction of H2O2 and HCOOH, while the second stage is
an 80 wt % solution of HCOOH at 100 C.  Milox pulp produces paper
of similar quality and brightness to chlorine-bleached kraft pulp,
says Kemira.

German Process Cuts SO2 and HCl Emissions

Caldyn Apparatebau GmbH (Ettlingen, Germany) has devised a process
for cutting sulfur dioxide (SO2) and hydrogen chloride emissions to
20 parts per million (ppm), well below the 100 ppm German limit.
The company claims that the process consumes only 33-50% of the
lime required by competitive processes.  Flue gas enters a dryer at
250-1000 C where it is sprayed with 50 mm diameter lime particles.
In this step, the lime is completely consumed, reducing SO2
concentration by 70%.  Following de-dusting, the gases are washed
in a second scrubber that combines an additional nozzle-sprayed
lime slurry with a water aerosol.  At this step, the lime
concentration, 70%, is 7 times higher than in competitive
processes, reducing the scrubber size by 50%.  Following a final
de-dusting step, the gases are released.  In addition to the
company's 500 m3/h mobile pilot plant, Caldyn has installed a 3200
m3/h system on a chemical waste incinerator in Bonn, Germany, which
started in June 1993.  Negotiations are in progress for a 44,000
m3/h unit for an incinerator at an animal feed plant in eastern
Germany.

Natural Gas Technology Cuts NOx Emissions

Institute of Gas Technology (IGT, 3424 South State Street, Chicago,
IL 60616; Tel 312/949-3650, Fax 312/949-3700) in tests at the
Anchor Glass plant in Huntington Park, CA  confirmed that an
advanced glass melting technology is effective in reducing nitrogen
oxides (NOx) emissions.  Hamid A. Abbasi, IGT's Assistant Director
- Applied Combustion Research, told us that the technology uses
staged natural gas combustion with oxygen enrichment to lower NOx
levels below 3 pounds of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) per ton of glass
produced.  A consortium of gas utilities led by Southern California
Gas Company and the Gas Research Institute is supporting the
development of this technology.  The process does not increase
natural gas consumption, and oxygen requirements are low (less than
5% of stoichiometric) for operating conditions that reduce NOx
remissions below the Southern California regulation of 4 pounds of
NO2 per ton of glass produced.  To demonstrate the stating concept,
IGT and its commercial partners, Combustion Tec, Inc. (Box 607693,
Orlando, FL 32860; Tel 407/299-7317) and Air Products and Chemicals
(7201 Hamilton Blvd., Allentown, PA  18195; Tel 215/481-4911), made
only minor modifications to a 165 ton/day glass melter.  Glenn C.
Neff, President - Combustion Tec, said that the changes are
transparent to furnace operators, and no adverse effects on the
quality of container glass have been observed.  According to Buddy
Eleazer, Air Products' Technology Manager - Glass Applications,
three months of additional testing are now under way to acquire
design data for the commercial introduction of the technology.

Ammonia Injection Lowers Engine NOx Emissions

James W. Davis (277 Kavenish Dr., Rancho Mirage, CA 92270) has been
assigned a patent for a method of reducing engine pollutants,
particularly nitrogen oxides (NOx).  The process described in US
Patent 5,224,346, issued to Lester P. Berriman, John M. Zabsky,
James W. Davis, and William M. Hylton on July 6, 1993, involves the
injection of ammonia into a conduit between the cylinder exhaust
valves and the catalytic converter.  Ammonia injection occurs far
enough downstream of the exhaust valves to avoid burning of the
ammonia and at a location where the exhaust gases are at a
temperature of at least 1200 F.  The ammonia reacts with the NOx in
the exhaust gases prior to the gases reaching the catalytic
converter, which eases the load on the catalyst.  To minimize
ammonia use, it is injected only one minute or so after cold engine
startup when the catalyst is too cold to be effective and during
operation of the engine at high power levels, when the greatest
amounts of NOx are produced.

efficiency, power, fuel economy, and emission control.  The
benefits described in US Patent 5,224,460, issued to Peter H.
Havstad and Rodney J. Tabaczynski on July 6, 1993, are obtained by
phase shifting of both the intake and exhaust valve timing events.
Also, reed valves restrict the backflow of exhaust gases into the
intake ports.  The phase shifting and use of intake reed valves
optimize the intake and exhaust event timing at the four major
engine operating conditions: idle, part load, wide open throttle
low speed, and high speed.

Osaka Gas Co., Ltd. (4-1-2 Hirano-machi, Chuo-ku, Osaka 541, Japan;
Tel 6 2022221, Fax 6 2261681) has a patent for a gas burner which
has low nitrogen oxides (NOx) generation and combustion noise
levels and improved combustion load and  ignition performance
characteristics.  The gas burner described in US Patent 5,224,855,
issued to Hajime Toyonaga, Toshio Nishida, Yasuo Takeishi, and
Masao Shiomi on July 6, 1993, uses two sets of flame openings.  The
first set discharges stable, self-combustible, high-concentration
gas; and the second set of flame openings discharges unstable, non-
self-combustible, low-concentration gas.  The two sets of flame
openings are arranged in an alternate pattern.  The stable flame
formations at the first set of flame openings assists stabilization
of flame formations at the second set of flame openings.
Consequently, the gas burner may have a high air excess ratio to
reduce its NOx generation and to prevent incomplete combustion.

EPA Delay in Implementing Air Permit Rule Causes States to Miss
Program Submission Deadline

Title V of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) charged the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with issuing a permit
rule that would identify minimum elements of state permit programs
and govern the implementation of state efforts.  Disagreement among
EPA, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the Council on
Competitiveness delayed the rule's issuance for 8 months.  This has
hindered implementation of the Title V permit program since some
states have waited for the final rule to be issued before
developing their own programs.  Similarly, certain state
legislatures waited for the final rule before enacting legislation
authorizing agencies to fully implement programs and assess fees to
cover their costs.  Because the final rule was issued after many
state legislatures adjourned in 1992, many state agencies had to
wait until 1993 to obtain legislative authority.  As a result, some
states doubt that they will be able to submit their program plans
to EPA by the November 1993 deadline.

Cost estimates by some states indicate that they will face problems
in funding their permit programs.  Although many state agencies
have adopted the $25 per ton of emissions presumptive fee set by
Congress in Title V because of political and economic pressure to
keep fees low, many state officials do not consider this fee
adequate to fund their programs.  For example, Texas' permit
program costs are expected to increase by nearly 300% when Title V
is fully implemented, from the current level of about $15 million
to about $42 million, or $30 to $35 per ton of emissions.  North
Carolina's Clean Air Act Advisory Council has determined that the
state's cost of meeting Title V will be $12 million, or $36 per ton
of emissions.  Wisconsin has estimated that Title V will increase
its needs from $9 million to $18 million.  Wisconsin officials
believe that the state's permit fees should be set between $35 and
$40 per ton to generate the necessary revenue.

Center for Resource Economics (CRE) Report Criticizes EPA

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is failing to carry
out its mission because of gross under-funding and skewed
priorities, according to a study by the Center for Resource
Economics (CRE), a Washington, DC-based nonprofit environmental
research organization.  EPA needs a budget increase of at least 13%
"to provide even minimally adequate environmental protection," the
report says, but instead is facing an 8% cut in its 1994 budget.
The CRE report found that EPA has a 22% budget shortfall in its
core operating programs and, as a result, is unable to fully
enforce a single environmental protection statute.  EPA spends 80%
of its funds on pollutants ranked as relatively low risks by the
agency, with 20% going to high risk pollutants, charged CRE.
Inactive toxic waste sites and point source discharges to surface
water, two of the low risk categories, receive 54% of EPA
resources, while high risk air pollutants receive only 6%.  Worker
exposure to chemicals, radon, wetlands destruction, and global
climate change - all high risk areas - receive less than 1% each of
EPA's resources.  "More than 2 decades after its creation, EPA
cannot guarantee the safety of pesticides and other toxic
substances widely used in the U.S.," CRE said.  EPA officials say
that their priorities are largely determined by laws passed by
Congress and that the agency's budget is constrained by the federal
budget deficit.

Sulfur Dioxide Emissions Allowances Auction Canceled

The Chicago Board of Trade (CBT) canceled its scheduled June 1993
auction of sulfur dioxide emissions allowances because the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has not implemented a
computer-based allowance tracking system.  CBT successfully ran
EPA's March 1993 auction.  EPA says that the tracking system is
unnecessary for companies to trade the allowances privately.

U.S. Leads in Pollution Control Equipment Exports

The U.S. was the world's leading exporter of pollution control
equipment in 1991 with a trade surplus of $1.1 billion according to
a report released by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA).  Germany led in 1990, but U.S. companies took the lead in
1991 with $188 million more in exports than Germany.  U.S.
environmental exports increased 70% from 1989 to 1991, while
imports increased 45%.

Inst. of Clean Air Companies says Smog Control Costs Exaggerated

The Institute of Clean Air Companies, Inc. (ICAC, 1707 L Street NW
Suite 750, Washington, DC 20036-4201; Tel 202/457-0911, Fax
202/331-1388), the national association of air pollution control
suppliers, has released cost figures for high efficiency control of
nitrogen oxides (NOx) that are only 20-50% of the costs assumed by
state regulators in determining reasonably available control
technology.  ICAC released the figures in comments on a report,
Evaluation and Costing of NOx Controls for Existing Utility Boilers
in the NESCAUM Region, (Evaluation Report) prepared by Acurex
Environmental Corporation for the Northeast States for Coordinated
Air Use Management (NESCAUM) and the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA).  ICAC's cost figures show that much more NOx can be
removed for a given level of investment than air quality regulators
have assumed.  For example, the Evaluation Report pegs capital
costs for retrofitting hot-side selective catalytic reduction (SCR)
technology on a 200 MW pulverized coal boiler at about $150/kW.
ICAC says that current market transactions show that this cost is
$30-70/kW, depending on the difficulty of retrofit.  Costs for oil-
and gas-fired retrofits, as well as for new installations, are even
lower.

States are revising their Clean Air Act implementation plans to
further cut NOx emissions, which contribute significantly to urban
smog and acid rain.  "Clean air policy depends on assumptions about
the cost of air pollution controls.  In the case of NOx, reliance
on inflated cost estimates is leading decision makers to establish
unnecessarily loose standards based on controls that can remove no
more than half of a boiler's NOx emissions, when SCR technology is
available to achieve 80-90% emission removal," stated Jeffrey C.
Smith, ICAC's Executive Director.  "The market  history of SCR
technology exemplifies the path of most air pollution controls
commercialized in the U.S. over the past 30 years.  Competition
pushes costs significantly lower and raises performance and
reliability dramatically," Smith added.  A copy of ICAC's written
comments is available from the organization, which has prepared
comments highlighting what it claims are inaccuracies in the
treatment of selective non-catalytic (SNCR) reduction of NOx in the
Evaluation Report.

Cost Effectiveness of Eliminating CO Vehicle Emissions Studied

The cost effectiveness of identification and repair of vehicles
with excessive carbon monoxide emissions was investigated over the
1991-1992 winter period in Provo, UT.  This pilot program used on-
road remote sensing at two locations to identify repeat gross
polluting vehicles.  The owners of gross polluters observed at one
of the locations were solicited for a free repair program carried
out under the direction of the Utah Valley Community College, Auto-
Diesel Division.  The same two locations were revisited after the
repair program had terminated and the vehicle emissions were
remeasured.  Gary A. Bishop, Donald H. Stedman, James E. Peterson,
Theresa J. Hosick, and Paul L. Guenther (Chemistry Department,
University of Denver, University Park, CO 80208-0179) obtained more
than 17,000 measurements on over 10,000 individual vehicles.  As
observed elsewhere, half of the total carbon monoxide was emitted
by only about 10% of the vehicles.  Solicitation letters were sent
to 114 owners, and 47 vehicles were recruited and repairs
attempted.  Of the 47 vehicles, 28 were remeasured when the site
was revisited at the end of the program.  They had improved their
on-road emissions by more than 50%.  The vehicles which were
identified as gross polluters at the second location, but not
notified of their status, were used as the control group.  Their
emissions were also reduced, but only by 14%.  This pilot program
demonstrated carbon monoxide emissions reduction at a cost
effectiveness of $200 per ton, not including the cost benefits of
gas mileage improvement.  $200 per ton is lower than many current
or proposed mandatory programs.  The owner's repair cost would more
than pay for itself in terms of improved fuel economy.  The program
would also generate the on-road fleet emissions data necessary to
evaluate its effectiveness.  Without such data, a program is forced
to rely on computer modeling with its known limitations.  The
researchers published the results of their work in Air & Waste,
Vol. 43, July 1993, 978-988.

Multi-Layer Coating Reduces VOC's

Du Pont (Wilmington, DE 19898; Tel 302/774-1000) has been assigned
a patent for a low volatile organic compound (VOC) multi-layer
clear coating.  The process described in US Patent 5,227,201,
issued to Lee R. Harper on July 13, 1993, forms multiple coats of
finishes on a substrate by first applying a color basecoat layer of
pigment-containing acrylic polymer latex.  Before the basecoat is
cured, a clear coat acrylic polymer having crosslinkable groups and
a crosslinking agent in a volatile organic solvent is applied.  The
layers are cured simultaneously.

VOC's Thermally Stripped from Soil

Richard and Junior L. Crosby (7819-105 Calibre Crossing, Charlotte,
NC 28227) has  a patent for a process which thermally strips
volatile organic compounds (VOC's) from soil using a recirculating
combustible gas.  The transportable system described in US Patent
5,228,803 was issued on July 20, 1993 and includes a vessel in
which contaminated soil is placed in contact with a hot gas.  The
gas is discharged from the vessel, and ambient air is introduced
into the gas to ensure that it remains combustible.  A blower
circulates the gas to a cyclone separator, where fine soil
particles and ash are removed.  The VOC's in the gas are removed by
combustion in a burner fired with a supplemental fuel.  A portion
of the combusted gas is exhausted to the atmosphere, and the
remainder is recirculated to the vessel where the process is
repeated.

Low VOC Cleaner Used Automotive Refinishing

Du Pont (Wilmington, DE 19898; Tel 302/774-1000) has  a patent for
a low volatile organic compound (VOC) cleaner.  The composition
described in US Patent 5,230,821 was issued to John C. Larson and
Gary L. Horton on July 27, 1993.  It includes an aqueous emulsion
of a non-aromatic organic phase stabilized with a blend of
surfactants.  The emulsion is characterized by a low content of
VOC's and superior cleaning properties.  It is particularly useful
for removing water- and organic solvent-soluble materials from
automotive surfaces being refinished.

VOC Emissions from Glycol Dehydrators Reduced

The Gas Research Institute (Chicago, IL) has been assigned a patent
for a system to control volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions
from glycol dehydrators.  The system described in US Patent
5,209,762, issued to Philip S. Lowell on May 11, 1993, places a
glycol in contact with a natural gas stream to extract water from
the gas.  The glycol is regenerated by heating it to vaporize the
absorbed water.   The vented steam VOC contaminants flow from the
glycol regenerator to the bottom of a steam stripper column.  The
vapors from the top of the steam stripper column are condensed to
produce a water stream with a relatively high concentration of
VOC's.  The water stream is passed to the top of the steam stripper
and then through the stripper counter-currently to the vented gases
and steam.  The condenser water stream is thereby stripped of most
of its organics content and emerges from the bottom of the stripper
column.

RESOLV  Vapor Recovery Systems Capture VOC's

New chemical vapor recovery systems developed by Air Products and
Chemicals, Inc. (7201 Hamilton Boulevard, Allentown, PA 18195-1501;
215/481-8451, Fax 215/481-5431) are helping the chemical process
industries (CPI) meet volatile organic compound (VOC) emission
regulations mandated by the Clean Air Act Amendments (Air Toxics
emissions) while reducing costs through the recovery of valuable
chemicals.  RESOLV  chemical vapor recovery systems can remove 95-
99% of the VOC's by using liquid nitrogen to cool process vent
streams to targeted temperatures, condensing, and capturing the
VOC's in liquid form.  The VOC's are captured before they are mixed
and diluted by other waste streams, thereby significantly reducing
disposal costs.  The recovered chemicals can then be sold or
recycled in the manufacturer's operation.  Additionally, further
cost savings can be achieved, since the required quantity of
nitrogen to operate a RESOLV system is often already available on-
site.

In a typical RESOLV installation, liquid nitrogen and VOC emission
streams pass through an indirect condenser.  In the condenser, the
cold liquid nitrogen condenses the VOC's and captures them in
liquid form, while the liquid nitrogen simultaneously converts to
gaseous nitrogen.  The clean, VOC-free vent stream exits the
recovery system, and the clean, gaseous nitrogen is then used
elsewhere in the chemical manufacturing process such as in inerting
processing or storage vessels.  The purity of the nitrogen remains
intact, since it does not come into direct contact with the VOC's.
As a result, Air Products' RESOLV systems permit chemical
manufacturers to realize both the cryogenic and inerting benefits
of their nitrogen supply without the cost and performance
disadvantages associated with freeze-thaw systems.

Air Products says that RESOLV systems offer several advantages over
alternative technologies for meeting VOC regulations.  Air
Products' systems are flexible and can accommodate changes in VOC
regulations without re-engineering the system.  The amount of VOC's
recovered with a RESOLV system can be adjusted simply by reducing
the  temperature of the indirect condenser.  In addition, capital
costs are less; permitting of flares, incinerators, or catalytic
combustion equipment is avoided; and there are no environmental
problems associated with nitrogen oxide and small amounts of non-
combusted VOC's.  RESOLV systems also eliminate the disposal
problems created by adsorption technology or scrubbers.

Air Products' Dr. Bud Dalton, Commercial Development Manager for
the technology, stressed that "RESOLV systems are more than end-of-
pipe solutions; they can be integrated upstream into manufacturing
processes to achieve additional savings."  Air Products customizes
these systems to cost effectively address each customer's VOC
stream composition and recovery/compliance targets.  In some
instances, the CPI customer may only require supplemental cooling
to meet current emission standards.

RE-THERM VF Units Treat VOC's

Research-Cottrell Reeco, Inc. (Box 1500, Somerville, NJ 08876; Tel
908/685-4000, Fax 908/685-4181) is marketing its RE-THERM VF system
to oxidize volatile organic compounds (VOC's) and other airborne
pollutants.  Nicholas Coppola, Senior Vice President - Sales, told
us that the technology offers destruction efficiencies of 96-99%.
During operation of the RE-THERM VF system, contaminated process
air enters the unit through an inlet manifold.  Flow control valves
direct the exhaust into those regenerative chambers that have just
switched to the "inlet" mode.  These chambers contain hot ceramic
stoneware that has absorbed most of the heat energy from a previous
batch of exiting cleaned air.  When the incoming, contaminated
exhaust is drawn through the hot stoneware bed, its temperature
increases.  This causes many pollutants and odor-causing compounds
to auto-ignite even before they reach the main purification
chamber.  Gas or oil burners in the main chamber maintain the
required purification temperature.  If the incoming gas stream
contains enough VOC's, the unit can self-sustain, keeping fuel
costs very low.  The purified air is channeled out through a
stoneware bed that has switched to the "outlet" mode.  There, it
deposits most of its heat energy which is transferred to yet
another batch of incoming, contaminated process exhaust.  In most
applications, warm, clean air is then vented to the atmosphere.
Another option is the return of the warm exhaust to the plant to
heat dryers, ovens, or other equipment.  In some units, waste
solvent can be used as auxiliary fuel, further reducing operating
costs and alleviating the plant's solvent disposal problem.  Single
units with a horizontal flow design can treat up to 500,000
ft3/minute.

Fate of VOC's in Municipal Activated Sludge Plants  Investigated

The fate of volatile organic compounds (VOC's) in municipal
activated sludge plants has been investigated at pilot and full
scale.  Wayne J. Parker, Doug J. Thompson, John P. Bell, and Henryk
Melcer found that more than 80% of the mass flow of non-chlorinated
compounds was biodegraded while less than 20% was removed by
stripping.  Conversely, 46% of the mass flow of chlorinated
compounds was biodegraded and 47% was removed by stripping.
Adsorption of VOC's onto waste sludge was not a significant removal
mechanism.  The pilot plant used effectively emulated the liquid-
gas phase partitioning and overall compound removals of a full-
scale plant.  There was little difference in liquid-gas phase
partitioning for coarse and fine pore diffusers in spite of
differing mass transfer characteristics as demonstrated by oxygen-
transfer measurements.  This implies that equilibrium between the
liquid- and gas-phase concentrations was achieved with both
diffuser types.  Stripping of VOC's increased with air flow, but
the extent of stripping increased at a declining rate.  The
researchers summarized their work in a paper published in Water
Environment Research Vol. 65, No. 1.

ICI Paints Reduces VOC's with Water-Based Formulations

In an effort to reduce volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions
from paint solvents, ICI Paints (Slough, UK) has developed what its
says is the first water-based metallic paint for automotive
refinishing.  About 15% of the 800 million liters/year of paint
sold by ICI goes to the auto refinishing market.  The product is
scheduled for introduction in both Europe and the U.S. later in
1993.  The company estimates that European auto repairs account for
about 117,000 metric tons/year of VOC emissions.  ICI has been
active in the Canadian auto refinishing market for many years and
entered the U.S. arena in September 1992 with its existing organic
solvent-based product line.  The new water-based product, which
adapts a microgel latex paint system used in car manufacturing
since the early 1980's, contains only about 15% organic solvents
instead of the 85% or so contained in conventional metallic paints.
ICI hopes to reduce the organic solvent content below 10% by 1994.
The price of the new paint will be 5-30% higher than the existing
product line, but ICI points out that users will be able to avoid
the installation of VOC emissions control equipment.  The company
is manufacturing the new paint at Stowmarket, UK and is undecided
about U.S. manufacturing plans.

Influence of Landscape Variability on Atmospheric  Dispersion

Using idealized distributions of surface moisture, Roger A. Pielke
and Marek Uliasz (Department of Atmospheric Science, Colorado State
University, Fort Collins, CO) have shown that with a significant
synoptic prevailing flow over regions of surface variability,
dispersion is generally enhanced over heterogeneous surfaces as
compared to horizontally homogeneous conditions.  The importance of
heterogeneity becomes less as the large-scale wind speed increases
and/or the spatial scale of the heterogeneities become less.  The
work demonstrates that the use of Gaussian regulatory models in
areas of landscape variability is inappropriate.  The researchers
published the results of their work in Air & Waste, Vol. 43, July
1993,989-994.

Atmospheric Sulfur Oxidation Influence by Droplet Size in Clouds
and Fog

Cloud and fog have traditionally been assumed to be composed of a
chemically homogeneous population of droplets.  Model predictions
and experimental investigations by Xin Rao, Aaron Bator, and Jeff
Collett, Jr. (Institute for Environmental Studies, University of
Illinois, 1101 West Peabody Drive, Urbana, IL 61801) indicate that
this assumption may not be correct.  Variations in chemical drop
sizes across the drop size spectrum have been predicted and
observed in a number of environments.  The researchers examined the
influence of such variations on aqueous phase oxidation of S(IV) in
the atmosphere.  Measurements of the composition of various drop
size fractions in clouds and fog often reveal differences in pH.
Measurements of S(IV) and H2O2 concentrations in radiation fogs in
California's central valley revealed a dependence on drop size as
well.  Simultaneous variations of pH, S(IV), and H2O2
concentrations across the drop size spectrum complicate predictions
of net rates of sulfur oxidation.  The researchers believe that it
is unlikely that the average rate of sulfur oxidation across the
drop spectrum will be equal to the rate predicted based on average
cloud or fog drop compositions.  They summarized their work in a
paper, Chemical Variations Across the Cloud Drop Size Spectrum and
Their Influence on Sulfur (IV) Oxidation in the Atmosphere,
delivered at the 206th American Chemical Society (ACS) National
Meeting in Chicago, IL August 22-27, 1993.

Software Models Processes and Tracks Chemical Usage

ModelVision Software, Inc. (13186 Trail Hollow, Houston, TX 77079;
Tel 713/461-0043) has commercialized a process modeling and toxic
chemical tracking system.  The software, Visual Chem Track ,
provides both integrated process simulation and lifetime tracking
for more than 1100  chemicals.  "PC-based simulation and accounting
within individual processes and facility-wide meets the critical
needs of managers," said John Shaffer, ModelVision President, who
added, "Federal, state, regional, and local environmental, health,
and safety regulations mandate precise documentation and reporting.
At the same time, good management practice calls for constant
analysis and revision, both of individual operations and entire
processes.  Since businesses must keep accurate information for
compliance, our software builds on that base by means of a dynamic
model."

Shaffer said that the software is user-friendly and that the on-
line "help" feature allows users to master the software at their
own learning pace.  Each engineer or process manager describes in
detail the facility, production unit, and component operations
including the names and quantities of chemicals involved.  Once the
model is built, the system provides continuous, accurate tracking
of all chemicals, showing where efficiencies can be obtained in
both chemical use and by-product generation.  Using Visual Chem
Track, engineers and process managers describe facility and
individual production units in visual, process flow diagrams; enter
chemical substances involved in each step of facility operation;
track chemical consumption, processing, and by-product generation
at both the production unit and total facility levels; fine tune
operations using a mass balance transfer function to automatically
tabulate and balance chemical inputs and outputs; track more than
1100 compounds by CAS number, usage, or generation threshold,
regulation, and/or type of operation; provide a basis for comparing
operations with plans, assuring that both the total facility and
individual production units and sub-units operate optimally.
Visual Chem Track prepares federal and state environmental forms,
and produces reports tailored to management's specifications to
analyze trends and aid decision making.  The software requires
Microsoft Windows 3.1, an 80386 or higher microprocessor, and at
least 2 megabytes of RAM.  Visual Chem Track is priced at $2000.

German Technology Cuts Toxic Incinerator Residue

GSB mbH (Munich, Germany), a waste disposal company, has pilot
tested a process to cut the amount of toxic residue from 4500
metric tons/year to 3900 metric tons/year at a 70,000 metric
tons/year incinerator in Ebenhausen, Germany.  In the process,
fluegas from the incinerator first passes through an electrostatic
precipitator (ESP) to remove the dust.  Sulfur dioxide is then
removed from the fluegas in a 2-step washing process.  By
dissolving the dust from the ESP in the acidic wash water from the
first step of the fluegas cleaning process, GSB can transfer up to
80% of the dust  collected by the ESP to the wastewater stream,
which is then neutralized with calcium hydroxide or calcium
carbonate.  The undissolved material, including the metal
hydroxides, is filtered and vitrified in 2 stages at 500 C and
1000 C, respectively.  The dissolved salts, mainly calcium
chloride, go to a wastewater treatment plant.

Vitropore Ceramic Candles Clean Hot Flue Gas

Pall Corporation (2200 Northern Boulevard, East Hills, NY 11548;
Tel 516/484-5400 or 800/645-6532, Fax 516/621-3976) Vitropore
ceramic filter candles are intended for hot gas solid separation
processes.  Hot combustion gas is too corrosive and contaminated to
be filtered by any media other than ceramics.  If not adequately
filtered, solid particles and acid gases will cause erosion and
fouling of energy recovery system components.  Vitropore ceramic
candles combine high burst strength and thermal shock resistance
with high permeability, high filtration efficiency, and corrosion
resistance in a rigid silicon carbide medium.  They can remove
and/or recycle catalysts from any catalytic reaction.

The candles are made of finely-ground silicon carbide grains.
During manufacturing, grain size is carefully controlled to achieve
an even pore size distribution throughout the candle's length.
After blending the grains, the candles are isostatically pressed
and machined to specific dimensions.  Porosity and permeability are
uniform throughout the entire length of the candle, which provides
consistent filter performance during blowback operations.  Pall
claims that its Vitropore candles collect more than 99.9% of
influent solids on the surface of the filter medium.  The company
says that this high removal efficiency is due to the candle's top
surface layer which is a thin, du rable, fine-pore membrane
composed of one or more layers of bonded ceramic material.  This
surface membrane is supported by a thicker, coarser substrate which
enables the candles to function as barrier filters.  They are
especially suited to pulse cleaning or blowback operations, since
particle penetration of the filter body is minimized.  The result
is quantitative solids separation, free of migration or unloading
of particulate matter and consistently good effluent quality.  Pore
says that a major advantage of Vitropore candles is their ability
to withstand heat up to 1000 C due to a proprietary binding
material highly tolerant of thermal shock.

Vitropore candles remove contaminants and/or recover product in
halogenated hydrocarbon, petrochemical, catalyst activator, fluid
catalytic cracking (FCC), hazardous materials incineration, and
fluid bed coal gasifier applications.

The Changing Climate of Collaboration

     One dividend of our exploration of space has been that
series of photographs of earthrise over the moon -- of our
blue-green planet, fragile and entire in space.  As part of its
copyrighted series of op-ed ad pieces in the New York Times and
Wall Street Journal, Mobil Corporation (MOB-NYSE) last month
invoked the earthrise image to call for a new era of
collaboration between the camps of business and environmentalism.
Mobil says business "gets the picture."  That we are indeed all
in it together on spaceship earth and that changing times have
brought business to an understanding of environmental
responsiveness and activism.
     Mobil isn't alone.  A rising tide of collaborative studies,
initiatives, and projects large and small indicate a trend away
from confrontation and toward cooperation.
     Jim Middaugh, spokesman for the US Environmental Defense
Fund (EDF), told BATE "After twenty years of litigating, we're
finding that the carrot of improved profits is as compelling as
the stick of legal action."  And, true to that promise, EDF is
working with McDonald's Corp. (MCD-NYSE) in a major study to find
ways to reduce, reuse, recycle, and compost the solid waste from
the 11,000 McDonald's around the world.
     The EDF-McDonald's joint task force, a first between a major
environmental group and leading fast food retailer, will spend
six months looking at every step in McDonald's business.  The
joint announcement lists redesign and reduction in use of
packaging and shipping materials, increased use of materials with
less environmental impact, increased recycling and use of
recyclable packaging, composting of organic wastes, increased use
of reuseables shipping containers and foodware, and increased use
of recycled materials as possible areas of examination.
     The consultancy is distinctive because of the potential
leverage from its findings and the nature of the relationship.
In addition to the 11,000 McDonald's stores, there are another
130,000 fast food outlets and 330,000 restaurants in total in the
U.S. that stand to gain  from what is learned.  And every day,
McDonald's serves 22 million customers.   That's 22 million
chances every day to implant an environmental responsibility
message in the public mind.
     The agreement is carefully structured.  The study will be
made public and the feasibility of the recommendations assessed.
McDonald's says that, where feasible, they will implement the
recommendations.  If EDF and the hamburger maker disagree
materially, each has the right to issue a dissenting or separate
opinion.  Either party can end the project if no agreement looks
possible, and each is paying its own share to ensure
independence.
     So . . . within a week of one another, we have US$50 billion
Mobil saying "We don't see two camps.  Energies that ought to be
joined in collaborative efforts are far less productively
employed when slinging gibes or lawsuits.  When we work in tandem
-- or at least pull in the same direction -- a lot gets done."
And we have Fred Krupp, executive director of EDF, saying his
organization is "hopeful that this process (with McDonald's) will
illustrate ways in which business and environmental groups that
have significantly different perspectives can nevertheless work
together to achieve environmental improvements that are in the
public interest."
     Mobil's public call for conciliation and the EDF-McDonald's
venture are both discrete news events and points in a growing
trend.

Changing the Minds of Utility Regulators

     Other examples of corporation-environmental organization
collaboration are beginning to produce measurable results.  In
the summer of 1988, the US Conservation Law Foundation (CLF) and
New England Electric (NES-NYSE) agreed to work cooperatively on
conservation and load management programs and the attendant
regulatory and rate adjustments in the face of reduced sales.
     The transition from an adversarial to a cooperative
relationship has had an appreciable impact.  Armond Cohen, a
senior attorney on the CLF staff told BATE that in 1990, "New
England Electric will spend US$56 million on conservation,
exclusive of load management.  Over the life of that investment,
the NES outlay will yield savings to customers of $154 million in
current dollars."  Cohen reports that of the net $98 million pool
of savings, $80 million will be returned to the ratepayers, $10
million will cover costs, and $8 million will be returned to the
shareholders -- a .5% addition to the stockholders' return on
equity.  Cohen calls that an "attractive incentive to encourage
continued investment in conservation.  And," the Boston lawyer
continues, "those numbers don't reflect the reduced societal
costs of fewer dirty windows, less air pollution, fewer
respiratory problems."
     In 1991, says Cohen, the utility's conservation investment
will jump to $80 million, with $180 million in resulting savings
over the life of the investment.  The success of the CLF-NES
collaboration, particularly with state regulatory commissions,
has now been extended to 12 retail electric companies in New
England and New York and the development of a national
electricity conservation program for Jamaica.  $40 million was
invested across New England in conservation in 1987.  That figure
jumps to $200 million for this year, in part the result of the
initiative between New England Electric and CLF.  And the
investment will rise to $250 million in 1991.  The result?  In
what Cohen calls a conservative estimate, one third of otherwise
needed power plants in the region out to the year 2010 won't have
to be built, freeing that capital for other uses.
     At the National Audubon Society, Senior Scientist Jan Beyea
reminds that the Coalition of Northeast Governors (CONEG) has
brought together representatives of environmental organizations,
the various states' agencies and most importantly, 12 corporate
members in an extended collaborative effort to hammer out
standards and definitions of environmental terms -- leading to an
environmental seal for consumers.  In addition to his CONEG
participation, Beyea says he is often consulted informally by
corporations seeking Audubon's advice or opinion on new packaging
or product introductions.

European, Pacific Examples Surfacing

     While BATE's sources in Europe and Australasia all concede
that they are not aware of collaborative examples as remarkable
as the lion and lamb union of McDonald's and EDF, new initiatives
are surfacing.  In the United Kingdom, 30 non-government
environmental organizations have formed a coalition to foster
co-operation and environmental advocacy.  The Environment Council
calls its Business and Environment Programme "a major element" of
its work.  Steve Robinson, Chief Executive of the Environment
Council, numbers more than 300 corporations on the program's
membership rolls.  In an interview, Robinson told BATE the aim of
the Business and Environment Programme is "to promote the concept
that environmental sense is commercial sense."
     Robinson cites a recent exercise with 3M U.K. PLC during
which "50 environmental practitioners from our member
organizations sat down with 3M to talk about the benefits of a
complete corporate environmental policy -- how to prepare,
formulate, and most important, implement a company-wide
environmental policy.  As a result," said Robinson, "3M has just
adopted and made public a comprehensive environmental policy."
     On the Pacific Rim, Phil Noyce of Australia's Commission for
the Future (and soon to head Greenhouse Action Australia) advises
that his agency has been advising the international accounting
and management firm of Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu on a potential
expansion from financial to environmental auditing.
     David Stephenson, an environmental strategist and senior
counsel at the Boston marketing communications firm of Agnew,
Carter, McCarthy, sees more strategic collaborative alliances
ahead.  "There are probably thousands of saplings out there this
summer dying from neglect.  They were planted by companies who
wanted or needed an Earth Day press release, and then forgotten."
McCarthy thinks one-shot environmental gestures are fading.  As
senior managers incorporate environmental considerations into
every step of planning, budgeting, producing, and selling, the
expertise and experience of environmental groups will offer an
attractive opportunity for synergy.  Measurable new profits and
immeasurable public benefits can result.

European Environmental Venture Fund Reaches First Round Funding
Goal; Will Make Commitments By Year's End

     A European venture capital fund based in the United Kingdom
has exceeded its first round funding goal and is already in due
diligence on a variety of startups aimed at solving European
environmental problems.  The fund, the first of its kind in
Europe, is called the TR ECOTEC Environmental Fund.  The venture
fund is a limited partnership combining the skills of Touche,
Remnant & Co. in London and ECOTEC Investment Service Limited of
Birmingham.  ECOTEC is an independent corporate strategy,
economics, and marketing group specializing in the environmental
protection and waste management industry.  Touche, Remnant's
specialist technology investment team is seven years old and has
some 190 million pounds under management.
     The fund's objective is to secure high total returns through
capital growth, by investment in emerging companies engaged in
the environmental protection and waste management industry in all
of Europe.
     Richard Haines, Director of ECOTEC, told BATE the fund has
16 million pounds in hand, 1 million pounds more than their
interim goal.  "Within two years, we seek to have raised 30
million pounds," said Haines.  The fund is an unrecognized
collective investment scheme under the UK's Financial Services
Act.  Which means investment by private individuals is
prohibited.  Haines says "pension funds and blue chip
corporations predominate among the subscribing institutional
investors."
     Asked to characterize the proposals the fund has gotten so
far, Haines called them "all over the lot as to technology,
strategy, and polish -- as you might expect.  The greatest number
are water and waste water treatment schemes, tertiary processes
in membranes and other advanced filtration processes where the
technology is just emerging.  Next in quantity," Haines
continued, "are the land remediation companies.  And we're seeing
a lot of joint ventures between Northern European and US
companies on the one hand and Southern European companies on the
other.  An example is proposal by a Danish air pollution
management company and a Spanish engineering firm for a joint
venture in Spain."
     No investments have yet been made, but, says Haines, "We're
down to a dozen or so in due diligence and we expect to make two
commitments by the end of the year."

Internal, External Forces Affect Earnings at Big Waste
Collectors

     The New York-based Value Line investment service ranks the
US environmental companies first among 97 sectors for relative
share price performance over the next 12 months.  In an era of
rising environmental awareness and expectation, these growing
companies can count on continued public and private scrutiny --
on operations and on stock performance.
     Houston-based Browning Ferris Inc. (BFI-NYSE) posted third
quarter sales of US$767.562 million and operating income of
$82.378 million, up 18.5% and 8.8% respectively over the similar
period last year.  Analysts said BFI had reduced the out-of state
waste it accepted at its big Ohio landfill to appease regulators.
Diminished volume there and eroding margins as competition
heightens abroad accounted for results below expectation.
     For Waste Management Inc. (WMX-NYSE), it wasn't the second
quarter results -- earnings up 26%, to $178.872 million -- but
rather how an article in Barron's looked at Waste Management's
accounting that created ripples.  An article by Abraham Briloff
cites the booking of a non-taxable gain of $70.8 million
resulting from the unrealized appreciation of shares of its
Chemical Waste Management after Chemical's initial public
offering as an example of "liberal accounting."
     Rollins Environmental Services (REN-NYSE) saw quarterly net
go from red to black ink as the Wilmington, Delaware company saw
big new incinerators begin to operate at close to capacity.
Rollins netted $7,224,000 on $52,486,000 for the quarter ended 30
June.  That compares to a loss of $33.5 million on sales of $39.
6 million for the comparable quarter in 1989.  Rollins is on
target for a $200 million year with earnings of $19.179 million
on sales of $146.492 million for the first three quarters of its
fiscal year.
     The addition of used oil recycling and waste fluid recovery
to Safety-Kleen's (SK-NYSE) core business of automotive and
industrial parts and tool cleaning is producing steady gains.
From Elgin, Illinois, Safety-Kleen reports second quarter
earnings of $11,995 million -- 15% better than the same period
last year.  Sales were $132.885 million for the quarter and
$258.488 for the first six months of 1990.  Net earnings rose
from 31 cents to 35 cents per share quarter to quarter over '89.
     Chemical Waste Management (CHW-NYSE), 78% of which is still
held by Waste Management, added four cents to its per-share
earnings for its second quarter.  The largest of the US hazardous
waste handlers booked earnings of $43.081 million on revenues of
$270.446 million for the period ended 30 June, lifting earnings
from 17 cents to 21 cents per share over 1989.

Regulatory Uncertainty Whipsaws a New Public Company

     Even after the worldwide dip in equity markets brought on by
the Iraqi crisis, U.S. shares of pure environmental companies are
performing better than other sectors.  Of five environmental
companies that have gone public this year, four are trading above
their IPO prices.  The shares of Mid-American Waste Systems Inc.
(MAWS-OTC), Environmental Elements Corp. (NLCO-OTC), Sanifill
Inc. (FIL-AMEX), and Tetra Technologies (TTRA-OTC) are all
showing gains.  Sanifill, which closed at US$25 as we went to
press, was offered in April at $9.50, up over 150%.
     The laggard is Horsehead Resource Development Company
(HHRD-OTC) whose experience underscores the changing, expanding
regulatory climate facing environmental remediation companies and
the need for investors and businesses to be both nimble and
diligent.  Horsehead, offered at $14.50 a share in July, rose to
$22, but closed as we went to press at $13.75.  The company
recovers zinc in steel mills in western Pennsylvania that recover
steel from scrap metal.  Horsehead resells the zinc and also
recovers lead and cadmium from the steelmaking dust and sells
that to other processors.  The recycling produces a slag and the
slag is the problem.  The US Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) doesn't regulate the slag, and indeed the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation is a Horsehead client and uses the
slag on icy roads.  Because the process isn't regulated, the
costs are low compared to regulated landfills and other waste
treatment and recovery operators.
     The trace lead, cadmium, and chromium in the slag has
produced an unusual alliance.  Environmental groups and the
Hazardous Waste Treatment Council, the waste treatment operators,
have joined to challenge the EPA to regulate the slag.  A federal
district appeals court in Washington, D.C. said last month that
the EPA does indeed have the power to regulate the slag and asked
that it begin to do so.
     Only in its final offering document did Horsehead mention
the federal court case, saying even then that the ruling was
immaterial.  Horsehead contends that its recovery technology is
the industry standard and that the EPA accepted that notion.
     The company is at work on a process to use the slag to
reclaim more heavy metals from waste water, but the regulatory
pressure is there.  Reports on all these developments by Debra
Coy, an analyst for County NatWest subsidiary Washington Analysis
Corp. and the volatile price of zinc have combined with market
volatility to move Horsehead's shares lower.

Taxes on Carbon Proposed on Two Continents

     Businesses operating in the European Community may soon be
subject to a carbon tax.  The notion is part of a position paper
on potential economic and fiscal instruments of EC environmental
policy.  Action may come as soon as next month.  The paper calls
greenhouse gases "one of the most pressing problems of the energy
sector."  The carbon tax would be based on the amount of carbon
dioxide produced by each kind of fuel.  And presumably would
reduce greenhouse emissions by increasing efficiency and spurring
conservation and non-carbon based alternative energy research.
Depending on the array of conservation measures and energy
performance standards for buildings and appliances, a carbon tax
could increase fossil fuel prices by 20-30%
     The ideas raised in the EC paper will be on the agenda of an
informal meeting of EC environmental ministers in Rome next month
and may be acted on in formal session in October.
     The carbon tax idea is surfacing on the other side of the
Atlantic as well.  In an op-ed piece in the New York Times on
August 6, David Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council
and Alan Miller of the University of Maryland's Center for Global
Change, the authors urge President Bush to adopt a carbon tax,
saying the measure "would yield billions while sharply reducing
greenhouse emissions."

EPA Announces Stringent Sulfur Reduction Rule for Diesel Fuel

     In 1988 US petroleum refiners and diesel engine
manufacturers prepared a joint proposal to the EPA for on-highway
diesel fuel modification.  That landmark collaboration is the
basis for an EPA measure to reduce sulfur by 80% in diesel fuel.
Earlier rules resulting from the industry initiative limit heavy
duty particulates.  This new standard, to be met by 1 October
1993, reduces sulfur content of diesel fuel from 0.25 percent to
0.05 percent by weight.
     The rule will add as much as 2.3 cents per gallon to diesel
prices.  The EPA estimates annual costs to refiners between
US$380 and $910 million in 1995, and as much as $1.3 billion by
2010.  The measure will reduce the cost of emissions control
devices, saving buyers $60 to $325 per vehicle.  Fuel savings
from the newer more efficient catalytic technology will amount to
$200 million in 1995 and $465 million in 2010.  The measure may
cut engine wear, bringing the direct economic benefit above the
increased cost per gallon.  Nevertheless, expect the fuel
increases to be passed on by transit authorities and every
shipper using diesel trucks to virtually all of the nation's
commuters and consumers.
     The US measure is projected to reduce sulfate particulates
by 196,000 tons by 1995 and reduce sulfur dioxide levels by
580,000 tons annually.  Sulfur dioxide further oxidizes in the
atmosphere to form sulfuric acid and ammonium sulfates,
components of acid rain.
     European pressure to match the US standards has prompted a
cost study by CONCAWE , a consortium of 36 petroleum companies
controlling 90% of Western European refining capacity.  CONCAWE
finds, depending on diesel demand and the availability of low
sulfur crude, that to produce 0.05% sulfur content diesel fuel,
the 12 EC countries could expect to make an additional capital
expenditure of between US$3 billion and $4.3 billion; that the
cost per ton of sulfur removed would range between $6,000 and
$9,000; and that the total manufacturing costs would reach to
between $12 and $18 per ton of diesel fuel.  (These are metric
tons, which equal 1.102 US tons.)
     For more information on the EPA rulemaking, the contact is
Martha Casey at +1 202 382 4378.  Information on the CONCAWE
study can be gotten from Denis Lyons, CONCAWE, Madauplein 1,

Superfund Changes Put EPA (and Taxpayers) Between Banks and
Environmental Groups

     The US Superfund is a two-pronged federal tool to clean up
toxic sites.  The law sets a standard of liability for those who
pollute that is strict, joint, and federal.  That means a person
or corporation can be liable regardless of fault, and that the
government can go after cleanup costs from any one defendant.
The other prong is the pool of money, Superfund itself.  Those
dollars can be used to clean orphan sites where those
responsible cannot or will not pay.
     Although Superfund can cast a wide net, lenders have
typically been protected from the law's reach.  Merely holding
collateral or other security interest, typically a mortgage, in a
contaminated property will not set off Superfund liability.
     In return for this protection, banks and savings and loan
institutions are obliged to exercise due diligence in evaluating
environmental risks as part of their lending.  That has soured
some deals, but more importantly produced heightened awareness
and environmental protection, possibly staving off some future
Superfund sites.  In the Senate, S.2827 exempts lenders "from any
law imposing strict liability for the release . . . of hazardous
substances from property (1) acquired through foreclosure; held
in fiduciary capacity; or (3) held, controlled, or managed
pursuant to the terms of an extension of credit."
     That, says William J. Rogers of the Environmental Defense
Fund, guts Superfund's powers and preempts state laws.  Lenders,
the environmental groups testify, will look the other way,
avoiding the diligence current law mandates.  A similar bill,
with 273 co-sponsors, awaits the House Transportation and
Hazardous Waste subcommittee when Congress returns.
     Bankers, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), and the
Resolution Trust Corp. (RTC) all say they need the safe haven of
the new law's protection.  FDIC chairman William Seidman told the
Senate panel pollution liability is a major impediment to
government sale of properties acquired in the S&L bailout, with
the delay raising costs to taxpayers.   The EPA has recently said
that the banks and federal agencies have legitimate concerns.
And taxpayers, in framing advocacy, must decide whether they wish
to pay higher taxes for more Superfund relief or higher taxes for
increased costs in the S&L bailout.  The economics will be
thrashed out in September when the Congress reconvenes.

California Firm Ready for Expanded Pollution Rights Sales, But
Some Companies Won't Sell

     On the list of market-based incentives against acid rain,
one of the wildest is pollution rights.  The US EPA has
established a practice of creating and granting rights to pollute
the air.  Robert Beck of the Edison Electric Institute in
Washington, DC told BATE power plants are assigned a fixed number
of allowances.  "Allowance" in this case means a ton of sulfur
dioxide that the plant is allowed to emit annually.  "They're
assets," says Beck.  "Companies can lease them, trade them, buy
and sell them.  They can only be used forward in time and they're
recognized on a calendar year."
     Markets crave efficiency; pollution rights are no different.
Enter AER*X,  a pollution rights brokerage firm in Los Angeles,
the brain child of John Palmisano, who started the system while
he worked for the EPA.
     AER*X has just been sold by WPL Holdings to NaTec Resources
(NATC-OTC), which in turn is 44.8% held by CRSS Inc. (CRX-NYSE).
The $1.4 million company may benefit from expanded pollution
rights in the clean air bill that will move out of conference
when the US Congress returns in the fall.
     But there are uncertainties.  Tom Zosel, manager of
pollution prevention at Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing
(MMM-NYSE), cautions that "the EPA is tightening its market
mechanisms in non-attainment areas.  Companies that use the
credits are essentially going forward and modifying as they go.
For a time, the EPA was making policy in response to specific
instances, so the initiators were ahead of the curve . . . but
everyone learned to live with a high degree of ambiguity."
     Zosel reports that 3M is no longer selling emission credits,
but is buying.  "3M has spent $160 million to implement
substantial emissions reductions.  If we turn around and sell the
rights to what we've gained, we've done nothing for the
environment.  We're keeping the rights for future growth or to
return to state and local agencies as improvement in air
quality."

Regional Center Will Build Foundations for Environmental Action
in Central and Eastern Europe

     That the governments of Eastern Europe did not provide clean
air and clean water contributed in part to their overthrow.  Now,
as these new governments move away from command economies, they
are inundated by sellers of environmental remedies.  Because the
problems are so large, so are the opportunities to profit.
     One international initiative on the environment that stands
to rationalize the process is the Regional Environmental Center
for Central and Eastern Europe in Budapest.  The center's charter
was signed earlier this summer by the US, The Netherlands,
Hungary, and the European Community.  Other nations in the region
are expected to sign on.
     The Center will operate as an independent, not-for-profit
non-governmental organization under a 15-member international
board.  BATE asked Helen Petrauskas, vice president for
Environment and Safety Engineering at Ford Motor Company and one
of three US board members, where the board will begin.
     "We're starting from scratch," said the Ford executive,
"defining the kinds of institutions and the level of democratic
participation.  You must remember those nations must draft whole
new sets of environmental laws and create and staff environmental
ministries."
     "I hope we can create a credible neutral meeting place for
government, industry, and the environmental NGOs to come
together," Ms. Petrauskas continued.
     The Center's charter calls for work in four areas:
collection and dissemination of data; development of
institutions; education; and matching available resources with
regional needs -- a clearing house.  Asked whether this function
could be viewed as a trade mission, Ms. Petrauskas said, "There's
no doubt we're in the role of exporting economic expertise,
getting help on what's worth buying.  Poland, for instance is
besieged by environmental vendors and is trying to sort out the
claims.  But we have to be careful not to assume our way is the
best way."  Asked what she meant, Ms. Petrauskas said that a
regional model similar to the European community might offer the
best solutions.
     Philip Warburg, director of the Central and East European
Environmental Program for the Environmental Law Institute in
Washington, DC, echoed Ms. Petrauskas's observations. "First,
credible environmental protection regimes must be put in place,
and that raises issues of appropriate public involvement, the
public right of access to information, citizen suits, and the
role of the judiciary."
     Warburg cautioned environmental businesses that would go to
the region to be aware of "considerable differences in
receptivity in different countries.  Where the Hungarians are
entrepreneurial, Czechoslovakia, for instance, is emanating a
certain ambivalence to industrial perspectives.  In their vision,
they don't feel the need for a carbon copy of western values.
But," continues Warburg, "that skepticism shouldn't be penalized,
but understood."
     In succeeding issues, BATE will look at the public and
private initiatives under way in the region, identifying what and
who is working and why.  The US contact for the regional center

European Automakers Lead in Recycling

     For decades, rebuilt parts were an example of Yankee
ingenuity -- the reuse of durable, well-designed parts.  But U.S.
OEMs are struggling to catch their competition, particularly in
Europe, where a longer look at the lifecycle of all the materials
in cars is yielding interesting innovations.  Cars are being
designed to be reused and recycled, from bumper to bumper.  In
the face of stiffened recycling rules pending for EC members, the
German automakers are especially active.  BMW is building a
recycling plant in Wackersdorf.  Volkswagen is recycling
thermoset plastic sheet molding from its front ends on Golf
models and using it on engine shields in the same car.  The
thermoset technology is particularly interesting because the
thermosets, unlike the easily meltable thermoplastics, are
created from strong interlocking compounds, and therefore resist
easy handling.  Grinding and pyrolysis -- high heat (760 degrees
C) and no oxygen -- are beginning to produce results.  Mercedes
Benz has built a demonstration car with all its recyclable
components in green.  Mercedes is recycling excess plastics from
trunk floor production, reprocessing thermoplastic and
polyurethane panels to fabricate cable wrappings and wheel wells,
extracting and reusing the "noble" metals -- platinum, rhodium,
palladium, and cerium -- from catalytic converters.
     VDA, the German automobile manufacturing association, has
developed a labeling program for automotive plastics.  The plan
is designed to ease sorting and recycling.  Volvo, perhaps the
most environmentally proactive car maker, has joined the Germans
in adopting the VDA standards.

Du Pont Paired with Industry Council to Reduce Delaware Waste

     In another public-private partnership, Du Pont (DD-NYSE) and
the Council for Solid Waste Solutions are each giving the state
of Delaware grants of US$20,000 to fund a computer software
system for the statewide reduction of solid waste.  The software,
called WastePlan, was designed by Tellus Institute, a public
interest consulting firm.  The system is in place as a statewide
planning tool in Michigan and New York and as a municipal
planning tool in Boston.  The system helps state and local
planners assess the economic and environmental impacts of
collection and disposal systems.
     Du Pont's share will pay for the software license.  The
council's half will go for training and continuing technical
support.  Du Pont's Paul Wyche put the Delaware initiative in
context, telling BATE "Du Pont has pilot solid waste projects in
Florida, Tennessee, Texas, and Illinois.  In Illinois, we're
working with the state department of transportation to make
highway safety barriers from high density polyethylene.  That
project is up and running."
     Asked whether the money for the Delaware and other solid
waste initiatives came from a corporate giving budget or a line
budget, Wyche said the grants came from operating funds, and that
the set-asides for such projects were growing as Du Pont's and
the communities' awareness grew.

Trans-National Corporate Progress Against Ozone Depletion

     Company by company, CFCs and other ozone-depleting compounds
are being eliminated around the world.  Some recent developments:
     Intel Corp. (INTC-OTC), the Santa Clara, California
semiconductor maker, has plants in Ireland, Israel, Singapore,
Penang, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and the USA.  Intel says it
will eliminate chloroflourocarbons (CFCs) from its worldwide
manufacturing processes by 1992.  The company began tracking CFC
use in 1987.  Using conservation and alternate technologies,
Intel has reduced its CFC usage some 30% to date.  Intel has
substituted an aqueous-based cleaner for CFC-113 on its circuit
boards and targets not only CFC-113, but also CFC-11, 12, 114,
115, TCA, and carbon tetrachloride for elimination by the target
date.  The company announcement calls the program "one of the
most aggressive in the industry."
     The Big Three Japanese carmakers are making inroads on
CFC-12, the automotive air conditioning refrigerant.  Honda has
begun a worldwide program to get cfc recycling units in the hands
of its authorized dealers.  The units capture CFC-12 from the car
systems for purification and reuse.  Each unit will cost 260,000
yen or some US$1,700.  In Japan, Honda says 2,000 of its 2,600
dealers will have the units by this fall.
     Toyota set up its CFC Action Committee in April 1989.
Toyota says it will have CFC recovery and recycling units in its
service shops worldwide by next summer.  Toyota targets the
elimination of CFC-based foaming agents in its upholstery by the
end of 1991, and like every car manufacturer, is testing
substitute refrigerants and reconfigured A/C systems using HCFC
and other more ozone-benign compounds.
     Nissan says its CFC recycling hardware will be in place at
all its dealerships and service centers worldwide by March of
1992.  And Nissan will phase out CFCs in its autotomotive air
conditioners by the end of 1995.
     Lockheed, (LK-NYSE), the aeronautics and space manufacturer,
was stung in June by a Greenpeace allegation that the company was
a "laggard, failing to halt its use of ozone-destroying
chemicals."
     Lockheed's internal timetable calls for elimination of
ozone-depleters by the year 2000, a policy it points out is
consistent with Montreal Protocol targets.  In the last two
years, Lockheed has reduced its CFC-113 emissions 39% and TCA
(1,1,1 trichloroethane) emissions by 43%.
     Lockheed's government relations manager, Katherine Strehl,
pleads that the company's requirements "are often more stringent
technically and operationally . . . because ours frequently
involve spacecraft that must function for years without repair or
replacement of parts."
     In Toronto, Northern Telecom (NT-NYSE) says it has reduced
CFC use by half in the last 18 months.  The communications giant
has saved US$1.5 million in CFC-113 reduction and another $1
million in US CFC consumption taxes avoided.  The company has
joined with the US EPA to publish a manual on CFC management
practices for small and mid-sized CFC-113 users.

Flakt Will Retrofit Taiwanese Power Plant for $115 Million

     The ABB Environmental Systems Division of Flakt, Inc., a US
subsidiary of Asea Brown Boveri, will design, engineer, and build
a wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) system for Taiwan Power
Company's Lin Kou station near Taipei.
     Robert A. Agonis, vice president -- FGD systems for the
ABB/Flakt unit, is the project manager and just back from Taipei.
Agonis told BATE that a rising tide of democracy after the
lifting of martial law in Taiwan has produced a vocal, involved
populace with environmental concerns a high priority.  "With air
pollution going wild in Taipei," said Agonis, "the prime minister
is under considerable political pressure to make a success of
this plant."  Agonis's division won the job in competitive
bidding with contractors from Japan and West Germany.  Flakt Inc.
is the world leader in installed capacity for FGD systems.  The
US division accounts for US$500 million of the Stockholm-based
company's $2.8 billion in sales.  And Flakt's volume in turn is
part of ABB's $20.56 billion in global sales.
     The Taiwanese contract calls for the retrofit of two 350 mw
generating units -- the delivery of a turnkey FGD system.  The
technology will reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by 90% in a
process that combines limestone and a water spray with the flue
gas from the coal-fired plant.  As a by-product, the system
produces a commercial grade of gypsum for use in construction,
road building and concrete manufacture.
     The contact comes as the Republic of China's Economics
Ministry is launching a nation-wide energy conservation campaign.
Add the Republic of China to the list of countries, many of them
in Eastern Europe, where environmental technology vendors can
find new markets.

CALIFORNIA PLANNING DEVELOPMENT REPORT via NewsNet
JANUARY 1996

RESEARCHERS CALL FOR CEQA REFORM

  The California Environmental Quality Act should permit wide-
ranging discussion of environmental issues at the planning
stage but provide tightly focused analysis at the project level,
according to a new report from a team of researchers at the
University of California, Berkeley.
  "Fixing CEQA," a report published by the California Policy
Seminar, is the latest in a long series of documents suggesting
how CEQA might be reformed. It comes on the heels of a recent
policy report by the Little Hoover Commission, which also
proposed some changes to CEQA. But the Berkeley report also
contains a great deal of data on how CEQA is used by planning
practitioners in California.
  Underlying both reports is the ongoing question of what the
relationship should be between CEQA and the planning process.
Comparing CEQA to the National Environmental Policy Act and
17 other "mini-NEPAs" around the country, the research team
concluded that CEQA is much more widely used at the project
level than its counterparts P a fact that often makes it the
"driver" on many planning issues. Only the mini-NEPAs in
Washington and New York are used in so wide a range of
situations, but development activity in those states is a fraction
of what it is in California.
  Like the Little Hoover Commission report, the Berkeley team
recommends greater involvement of state and regional
agencies in the CEQA process and incentives to provide greater
certainty all along the line. "The fundamental problem with
CEQA," the researchers report, "is that it fails to encourage
fairness and consistency in the review process or in the
required impact mitigations." This problem is reflected in what
Berkeley planning professor John Landis, the lead researcher,
calls "the 90%/10% problem." "For 90% of the projects which
are not controversial, CEQA works fine," he said. "For the other
10%, it falls apart."
  Unlike the Little Hoover Commission report, however, the
Berkeley report does not recommend that CEQA be used as the
primary tool for environmental decision-making on a regional
and state basis. (For more information on the Little Hoover
Commission report, see CP&DR, December 1995.) "They want to
regionalize CEQA," Landis said. "I'm not sure that's the right
thing to do." Landis acknowledges that four regional issues
continually pop up in CEQA analyses: air quality, water, wildlife
habitat, and traffic. Instead of using CEQA as a regional tool to
solve these problems at the project level, the Berkeley team
recommends using CEQA in a different way at the plan level
and the project level. The Berkeley researchers also
recommended a series of improvements to cumulative impact
monitoring to handle regional issues.
  "At the planning stage," concluded the research team, "CEQA
should encourage a broad and open-ended discussion of
alternatives and environmental impacts. This discussion should
be integrated with ongoing local, regional, and state planning
processes. Environmental review of specific projects, by
contrast, should focus on the impacts of that project in relation
to all underlying adopted plans, still attempting to establish
feasible mitigation measures for all significant adverse
impacts."
  The Berkeley team's five specific recommendations are:
  1. Improving the involvement of state and regional agencies
in the CEQA process. This is similar to the Little Hoover
Commission's recommendations and it draws from the research
team's observation that state and regional agencies are
unpredictable players in the CEQA process.
  2. Increasing the certainty and consistency of local CEQA
review. Like the Little Hoover Commission, the Berkeley
researchers noted that a lack of consistent thresholds and other
standards makes it difficult for applicants to know how the
process is going to move forward. Among other things, the
Berkeley researchers propose that localities be forced to adopt
standardized thresholds and standardized mitigation measures
to be used in mitigated negative declarations.
  3. Improving mitigation and monitoring of cumulative
impacts. To overcome CEQA's chronic project-oriented
approach, the research team recommended such steps as an
expanded use of tiered environmental impact reports,
standardized mitigation measures to deal with regional
cumulative impacts, and greater use of pro-active regional
planning and conservation efforts.
  4. Making alternatives analysis better or else eliminating it.
The researchers characterized current alternatives analysis as
little more than a "scaling exercise" that shows how
environmental impacts can be reduced if the scale of the
project is reduced. The researchers proposed expanded
alternatives analysis at the plan level and a more fine-grained
alternatives analysis at the project level. But if these cannot be
achieved, the researchers concluded, the alternatives analysis
is not worth keeping.
  5. Creating more consistency and predictability in CEQA
litigation. The research team concluded that CEQA currently
contains few incentives to mediate disputes and/or avoid
litigation. The team recommended that the Governor's Office of
Planning and Research create a series of guidebooks to
establish "best CEQA practices" in areas where judicial direction
has not been clear or consistent.
  "Fixing CEQA" is available by contacting the California Policy
Seminar at (510) 642-5514.

  What distinguishes the Berkeley study from previous CEQA
analyses is the huge amount of data collected by the
researchers. Among other things, the researchers surveyed
local governments in California and quantified their use of
CEQA; did an in-depth comparison between CEQA and the other
"mini-NEPAs" around the country; and a case study analysis of
CEQA use in 14 local jurisdictions ranging from Calaveras
County to Rancho Cucamonga. (Some of the survey data,
analyzed by University of Illinois planning professor Robert
Olshansky, was discussed in the October 1994 issue of CP&DR.)
  Here are some of the research team's most interesting
findings:

  CEQA Is More Widely Used Than Comparable Laws Elsewhere.
  The researchers compared the use of CEQA in California to the
so-called "Mini-NEPAs" in other states. Mini-NEPAs exist in 15
other states plus Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. Yet
CEQA is more widely used in California than in any other state P
and, in fact, it's more widely used than NEPA, the National
Environmental Policy Act.
  Whereas California undertook some 1,300 environmental
impact reports in 1990, the equivalent figure (in 1992) was
only 364 in New York, 126 in Washington, and 69 in
Massachusetts. Connecticut undertook no environmental impact
reports/statements in 1992. Even the federal government,
operating under NEPA, initiated only 456 EIS's in 1992.
Similarly, while California processed more than 25,000
negative declarations in 1990, the equivalent figure (for 1992)
was 1,800 in New York, 7,500 in Washington, and only 12 in
Connecticut.
  Part of the reason for the difference is that the breadth of
CEQA's application is greater. But part of it is simply that
California's construction activity is so much greater than any
other state. When adjusted for the amount of construction
activity, the researchers found that only Washington and New
York have approximately the same amount of CEQA-type
activity. Hawaii and Minnesota lag far behind, while all other
states are barely even on the radar screen.

  EIRs and EIR Litigation Is Rare In Statistical Terms
  The researchers found that, statewide, well over 90% of all
CEQA actions result in negative declarations. Only about 6% of
CEQA cactions lead to EIRs in cities and 3.5% in counties. And
only one in every 354 CEQA reviews (less than 1/3 of 1%)
results in a lawsuit. But because CEQA is so widely applied, the
raw numbers are high even though the percentages are low.
The Berkeley numbers indicate that somewhere around 1,300
EIRs were being undertaken in 1990, while more than 400
CEQA lawsuits were filed in the five-year period between 1986
and 1990.
  The case studies revealed large variations in these numbers,
however. In Santa Barbara County, for example, 21% of all
CEQA reviews led to an EIR P a figure almost three times higher
than any other case study jurisdiction.
  The researchers also discovered that EIRs are far more
commonly used on residential projects than on commercial or
industrial projects. On a per-capita basis, more than twice as
many EIRs are initiated for residential as opposed to
commercial projects, and this finding holds true for both cities
and counties.

  Thresholds Are More Common for Counties Than Cities.
  The Berkeley researchers found that 80% of counties used
standardized thresholds in CEQA review compared to only 12%
of cities.

  Mitigated Negative Declarations Are Commonly Used
  The researchers found that mitigated negative declarations
are used more than half the time in CEQA reviews, though they
noted this includes a wide variety of different situations. This
figure was considerably higher for counties (66%) than for
cities (48%). More than 70% of all jurisdictions reported that
they have a mitigation monitoring program in place.

ADELANTO PAYS PRICE FOR BASE, WATER FIGHTS

By Morris Newman
   The City of Adelanto in San Bernardino County finds itself
isolated and on the brink of municipal bankruptcy, partly as a
result of longstanding fights with its Victor Valley neighbors
over control of a closed military base and the regional water
supply.
  The city is running a $4 million deficit and, until recently,
appeared in danger of defaulting on its bond payments.
Adelanto is also facing a $5 million settlement on a lawsuit
with San Bernardino County, and must borrow money from the
county to make its debt payments on redevelopment bonds.
The financial problems have also forced Adelanto to abide by a
regionwide water allocation that the city initially resisted.
  The story of this High Desert city is a worst-case example of
what happens when one city decides to resist regional
cooperation. It is also an extreme example of the trend in
California for jurisdictions to conduct business with each other
through the courts, and the consequences of doing so. While
most of the blame seems to lie squarely with the city's elected
leadership, recent news reports suggest that San Bernardino
County, the City of Victorville, and the Mojave Water District
each played a role in chastening the maverick city.
   Currently, Adelanto is desperately trying to avoid defaulting
on its bonds. In October, the city's bond underwriter, Tony
Wetherbee, disclosed at a council hearing that the city was
running a $4 million deficit after having spent more than $9
million in lawsuits against
neighboring jurisdictions. As of December, the redevelopment
agency was $760,000 short of a $2.4 million payment on a
bond issue of $46 million.
  Wetherbee is refinancing the redevelopment agency's bonds
by structuring a new issue of $55 million that would allow the
city to make its bond payments while allowing enough extra to
pay off the hefty settlement to San Bernardino County.
  Adelanto's path to near-ruin began in 1989, when the federal
Base Realignment and Closure Commission listed George Air
Force Base on its closure list. Adelanto, which borders the base,
wanted to annex the entire base and rejected the option of
joining the local reuse authority, the Victor Valley Economic
Development Authority (VVEDA), which includes San
Bernardino County and the neighboring cities of Victorville,
Hesperia, and Apple Valley.
  At one point, Adelanto offered the Air Force $25 million to
buy the base outright. The Air Force, however, recognized
VVEDA as the local reuse authority, and Victorville eventually
annexed the former base in 1994.
   Refusing to take the decision lying down, Adelanto fought
back with a host of lawsuits challenging the environmental
impact report for the reuse of George. At the height of the court
battle, there were a total of 34 lawsuits that cost the parties at
least $11 million in legal fees, according to the Base Reuse
Report, a Sacramento-based newsletter. Adelanto's
litigiousness, however, ultimately backfired by dragging the
city through a series of costly legal defeats. In 1994, a
Riverside Superior Court judge ruled that Adelanto could not
use redevelopment money in its effort to acquire George. And
in a court-ordered settlement conference in January, 1995,
Adelanto finally stood down and relinquished its claim on
George.
   At the same time, however, Adelanto got into another dispute
with its neighbors over the water rights at George. When
George was an operational military base, the state created a
special arrangement for the city and the base to share a
common allocation of water. However, last fall, at the
instigation of the Mojave Water Agency, a Riverside County
judge issued a comprehensive settlement of all water rights
claims in the area. Under the agreement, all water users were
required to reduce their water use and the Mojave Water
Agency, which sells water to 250,000 residents in the High
Desert, was named special master. (CP&DR, November 1995.)
  Adelanto did not agree to the settlement, continuing to claim
it had a "prior and paramount" right to the waters of the
Mojave River. At this point, however, the Mojave Water Agency
shrewdly used Adelanto's financial troubles on the
redevelopment front as a lever to get the city to buy into the
water agreement.
  Adelanto's redevelopment troubles began in 1993, when the
San Bernardino County Grand Jury audited the city's attempt to
acquire George. The Grand Jury found that the city was
borrowing money from its well-funded redevelopment agency
(most of Adelanto is carpeted in redevelopment project areas)
while the redevelopment agency attempted to keep itself afloat
by issuing new bonds with interest rates higher than the city
could afford. In its report, the Grand Jury found that the
redevelopment agency had "exhausted all available resources
for operations," while lacking "any financial plan detailing its
projected expenditures, bond proceeds and other revenues
over the next several years."
  Based on the Grand Jury's findings, San Bernardino County
sued Adelanto in November 1993. The suit alleged that the city
had spent more than $4.2 million to acquire George, and had
illegally dipped into redevelopment funds for city operations.
The suit requested a group of city officials, including then-
Mayor Mary Scarpa, five city councilmembers and City
Manager Patricia Chamberlayne to pay the redevelopment
agency $6.34 million for the tax increment used to pursue
George and other non-redevelopment purposes. The settlement,
signed in October, required Adelanto to pay the county $5
million by the end of 1995, while allowing the Adelanto
Redevelopment Agency to borrow $100,000 of the county's
"fair-share" cut of the city's tax increment revenues to make its
bond payments. The settlement also authorizes Adelanto to
float the $55 million bond issue, which would enable the city to
restructure its existing bond portfolio and raise the additional
$5 million to pay off the county.
  Adelanto city officials were angered, however, when news
reports revealed that the City of Victorville had quietly lent the
county $800,000 to fund the lawsuit against Adelanto.
Victorville's role was surprising, because it appeared to violate
a January 1995 settlement agreement between the two cities
not to engage in further litigation. But Mike Rothschild,
Victorville Mayor Pro Tem, said in an interview Adelanto had
broken the peace by prosecuting the water issue, which he said
was part of the "total settlement package."
   The final humiliation for Adelanto, however, came in
November, at the hands of the water agency. The city clearly
needed to move ahead as quickly as possible on the new bond
issue. But the city could not move forward without the
approval of the Mojave Water Agency. The water purveyor,
however, threatened to sue Adelanto over a crucial part of the
recovery plan P the merger of two redevelopment areas in the
city P unless the city agreed to the regional water-sharing plan.
Advisers to the city pleaded with the mayor and
councilmembers to give into the water agency, and avoid
catastrophe.
  "Adelanto is insolvent," bond underwriter Tony Wetherbee
told the council. Said City Attorney Robert Corrado at the same
meeting: "Municipal bankruptcy is an ugly, ugly thing. We're
going to be in litigation forever." Later, when the council
appeared adamant against the water deal, he pleaded, "This is a
mistake of cosmic proportions and it means the end of
Adelanto as we know it."
  Notwithstanding those pleas, Mayor Judy Crommie and two
other council members voted against accepting the water plan.
Almost immediately after the meeting, according to local news
accounts, Crommie changed her mind, and scheduled an
emergency meeting for the following Thursday, when she
switched her vote.
   Adelanto had attempted to complete the restructuring of its
redevelopment bonds by December 31, 1995, which was the
deadline for the $5 million payment to San Bernardino County.
Because Standard & Poor rated the issue (BBB-) P an important
precondition of the bond sale P only in the closing days of the
year, the county granted the city an additional 10 days to the
city to make its payment; the new bond issue was scheduled to
close on January 9, according to the Victor Valley Daily Press.
Michael Sakamoto, acting city manager and the only Adelanto
official who would agree to be interviewed for this story, was
reluctant to comment on whether he thought the city had done
wisely in spending so much of its treasury fighting for George
and the Mojave River. "I don't want to comment on the

SACRAMENTO FINALLY GETS OUT OF HYATT HOTEL DEAL

  The City of Sacramento has finally cut all ties to the Hyatt
Regency Hotel, a 15-story luxury hotel across the street from
the State Capitol that the Sacramento Housing and
Redevelopment Agency helped subsidize. The deal releases the
redevelopment agency from its obligations without laying out
any cash.
  In December, the city agreed to surrender title to the land
under the hotel and the adjacent parking garage (of which the
redevelopment agency owned 48%) to Mutual Life Insurance
Co. of New York, the hotel's current owner. In exchange, the
redevelopment agency has been released from its obligation to
provide a $1.5 million annual subsidy to the hotel's owners for
the next 68 years.
  The Hyatt opened in 1988 as part of a public-private
partnership between the redevelopment agency and several
prominent private developers in Sacramento including Joe
Benvenuti and Gregg Lukenbill. It was designed as a
centerpiece project for downtown Sacramento. The Hyatt is the
most luxurious hotel in downtown Sacramento by far, and its
meeting room facilities are located close to the downtown
convention center. The city invested $13 million in the project
and agreed to the annual subsidy for 75 years, retaining
ownership in the land and part ownership in the parking
garage.
  But Benvenuti and Lukenbill ran into financial trouble when
the real estate market went sour in the early '90s, and MONY P
the primary lender on the project P assumed ownership in
1992. Ever since, MONY and the city have sought to reach an
agreement that would take the city out of the project
altogether.
  In 1991, on the eve of MONY's foreclosure, the city offered
$11 million in order to be released from its obligations but
MONY rejected the offer. Earlier this year, one consultant
suggested that the city offer MONY $7.7 million and the hotel
land. But Mayor Joe Serna and some other members of the City
Council were reluctant to agree to a deal that called for the
redevelopment agency to turn cash over to MONY.
  Under the deal as agreed, the redevelopment agency will not
be required to provide any cash to MONY. In fact, MONY will
actually pay the redevelopment agency $196,000 for a small
parcel of land at the southwest corner of the hotel. And if
MONY seeks to sell the property, the city could profit. Under
the deal, the city will receive 25% of any sales price over $62
million. MONY officials said they have not decided whether to
sell the hotel.

ACCORD REACHED ON VERMONT AVENUE
  Los Angeles's leading politicians have reached an agreement
with First Interstate Bank to reduce the city subsidy on the
controversial mixed-use project proposed for the corner of
Vermont Avenue and 81st Street.
  A city loan to buy the property was approved by the City
Council in November but vetoed by Mayor Richard Riordan.
(CP&DR, December 1995.) Subsequently, however, the council
passed a unanimous override of Riordan's veto. In the ensuing
weeks, Riordan, Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, and First
Interstate agreed to a new financial agreement which calls for
the bank to put more money into the project so the city's
subsidy will drop from $90,000 per housing unit to $70,000
per housing unit.
  Riordan opposed the project for two reasons: opposition from
a nearby homeowners association and the high subsidy per
unit. Riordan became interested in the project after
neighboring homeowners P U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters among
them P said they are opposed to any housing development
along the commercially zoned Vermont Avenue corridor. He
also questioned the $90,000 subsidy, which is close to double
the typical subsidy in a city-assisted housing project.
  Under the agreement with Riordan, the project still retains 35

moderate-income townhomes. Yet Riordan claimed victory for
the neighborhood, saying that he, unlike other politicians, had
listened to a group of residents who have traditionally been
disenfranchised.
  The Vermont proposal arose from a design/build competition
for affordable housing sponsored by First Interstate after the
1992 riots. The project is to be built on a mostly vacant 1.7-
acre site that served as the original location of Pepperdine
University. As currently designed, the project will include 35
townhomes (selling for between $88,000 and $130,000 each),
six small retail storefronts, and a satellite office of the USC
Business Expansion Network, to be located in an historic art-
deco building on the site. The project was strongly embraced
by Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who represents the area.

MALIBU PASSES GENERAL PLAN
  Facing a deadline from the Governor's Office of Planning &
Research, the City of Malibu has finally approved a general
plan that many council members claim is not restrictive enough
even though outside critics call it too restrictive.
  Approval of the general plan came more than four years after
the city's incorporation. The city has been engaged in a highly
political dispute with OPR last year over a time extension for
approving the plan. OPR denied a time extension after claiming
the plan does not provide affordable housing choices. Property
owners are likely to challenge the city's general plan in court
on housing element grounds.
  The plan calls for one-acre lots (or lower density) on 95% of
the undeveloped residential property in the city. A few
residential properties will be permitted to build four to six
units per acre. The plan also prohibits construction in areas
previously designated by Los Angeles County as
"environmental sensitive habitat areas" (about 9% of the city
altogether) and discourages development of sidewalks, street
lights, and other typical suburban infrastructure.
  The plan calls for permitting the construction of one hotel
near Pepperdine University, which city officials hope will
produce enough revenue to keep the city solvent.
  Property owners and state officials were not the plan's only
critics. Officials in nearby Santa Monica also complained about
the plan, which says Malibu's homeless will probably have to
find shelter in Santa Monica. Mayor Paul Rosenstein told the
Los angeles Times: "There have been rumors for yers that other
cities have been sending their homeless people to Santa
Monica. This is the first time I have seen a city admit it."

FISH & GAME FEE TO BE REINSTATED

  After a new legal challenge, a Sacramento judge has ordered
the state Department of Fish & Game to resume collection of the
Fish & Game environmental review fee. But the state has not
yet begun collection of the fee and the judge has not yet
decided whether to make collection retroactive.
  However, Fish & Game may seek a legislative solution by
asking the legislature to repeal the law that instituted the fee
in the first place. Fish & Game General Counsel Craig Manson
said the agency has spoken to some legislators and legislative
staff members but no bill has been introduced yet.
  The latest set of developments are the most bizarre yet in the
controversial history of the fee. On the one hand, Sacramento
Superior Court Judge Jeffrey Gunther has ordered Fish & Game
to start collecting the fee once again even though he had
previously ruled the fee unconstitutional. And on the other
hand, Fish & Game has taken an official position against the fee,
even though the agency benefits financially from it.
  Last summer, Fish & Game agreed to stop collecting the fee as
part of a legal settlement with several plaintiffs who
challenged the fee as an illegal tax. (CP&DR Environmental
Watch, July 1995.) The legal settlement came after Gunther had
initially ruled against the fee. But the settlement was
subsequently challenged by the California Association of
Professional Scientists (CAPS), the union that represents most
of the biologists who work for Fish & Game.
  CAPS argued that a state department cannot stop enforcing a
state law unless ordered to do so by an appellate court.
Gunther agreed and ordered the state to begin collecting the
fee again. However, in early January, the Fish & Game
Department had not yet begun to collect the fee because
Gunther had not issued a final written ruling.
  The Fish & Game fees were instituted by a bill that passed the
legislature in 1990. Local development applicants subject to the
California Environmental Quality Act must pay $850 for Fish &
Game to review environmental impact reports and $1,250 for
the department to review negative declarations.
  As Fish & Game's revenue from hunting and fishing licenses
has declined, the fees have provided a new source of revenue,
bringing the agency approximately $3 million per year, or
about 2% of its total budget. The fees have always been
controversial because no other state agency has statutory
authority to collect such fees and because local governments
were required to collect the fees for Fish & Game.
  The fee was originally challenged in 1991 by Redding
property owner Albert Mills. Mills claimed that the fee was not
a fee for service and therefore constituted a tax. He further
argued that as a tax, the fee was invalid because it did not pass
the Legislature by a two-thirds vote. Mills later formed
Californians for Fair Government Fees, representing 112 other
applicants who had paid the fees. Mills's lawyer, Walter McNeill
of Redding, filed a separate suit because of a Fish & Game fee
he had paid personally.
  Last March, Gunther ruled in favor of Mills, saying that the
fees were really taxes because the state had never determined
the actual cost of reviewing environmental documents before
passing the law. Pessimistic about the chances of success on
appeal, the agency agreed to a settlement which called for
refunds to Mills, McNeill, and members of Mills's group, as well
as a ban on further collection of the fees.
  Craig Manson, Fish & Game's general counsel, said that
collection of the fees would not begin until Gunther issued his
written ruling. He also said Gunther's ruling would address the
question of whether Fish & Game should collect fees
retroactively from applicants who had not paid the fees
because of the legal settlement.

ORANGE COUNTY NCCP RELEASED
   A wildlife habitat plan calling for preservation of 39,000
acres of undeveloped property has been released in draft form
by Orange County.  About half the preserve will consist of
coastal sage scrub, the habitat of the controversial California
gnatcatcher. The Orange County Planning Commission is now in
the process of reviewing the plan and the Board of Supervisors
is expected to act on the plan in March.
  The plan is part of the "Natural Communities Conservation
Planning" program undertaken by local, state, and federal
agencies in 1991 when the gnatcatcher was first proposed for
listing under state and federal endangered species laws.
  Called the Central/Coast NCCP/HCP (habitat conservation
plan), the plan calls for preservation of almost 20% of all
property in a 325-square-mile portion of Orange County that
stretches from Cleveland National Forest south and west to the
Pacific Ocean near San Juan Capistrano. Much of the land to be
preserved is owned by The Irvine Co. The plan is designed to
protect a total of 42 species, most of which are not currently
listed under the state or federal endangered species laws. Part
of the plan's purpose is to provide property owners with
assurance that they will have met their legal obligations if any
additional species are listed in the future.
  The Central/Coast plan is the first of three "sub-regional"
plans dealing with different areas of Orange County. An NCCP
plan for south Orange County is expected to be released later
this year, and a third NCCP for north Orange County is also in
the works. Three NCCP plans are also under way in San Diego
County.

PACKARD BELL DEAL LOOKS GOOD--BUT COMES AT A PRICE

  One year after the conversion of the Sacramento Army Depot
into a regional headquarters for Packard Bell, the deal is
shaping up as one of the most successful conversions of a
military base in California. Part of that success can be credited
to extraordinarily high subsidies provided by the City of
Sacramento. Also sharing the credit is a base-conversion
method known as an "economic development conveyance,"
which allowed local authorities to acquire the base at no cost in
return for sharing the profits of base reuse with the military.
  To date, the conversion of the Army Depot has far surpassed
initial expectations of both job creation and tax revenues.
Packard Bell had projected employment for 1,000 jobs at the
end of its first year; the company currently employs 5,000
people at the former depot, which is now an assembly plant for
personal computers. In addition, the new plant has spurred the
creation of an additional 2,500 to 3,000 jobs in the community
at large. The payroll, initially projected at $60 million to $80
million, is currently about $200 million. The plant also
generates about $1 million annually in local taxes. City officials
claim that enterprise zone tax credits have encouraged a
greater level of hiring and have taken several hundred local
residents off the welfare rolls.
  The Army Depot is the first closed military base to use the
economic development conveyance. Without it, Sacramento and
the Army might still be arguing about the value of the Depot,
according to Bill Farley, the city's economic development
manager. "When we first met Army officials, it was clear in a
few hours that we would never be able to agree on the value of
this real estate," he said. Army officials based their valuations
of the Depot based on the money they had poured into the base
over the years. City officials saw a group of outmoded buildings
that had to be rehabbed and marketed in a depressed real
estate market. Although he would not disclose the Army's
asking price for the Depot, Farley acknowledged that "we were
tens of millions of dollars apart. We could not even agree on
how to approach the method of valuing the property." In
contrast, "the economic development conveyance and the
profit-sharing provisions really took that extremely
contentious issue out of the equation," Farley said. Under the
plan, the city can sell portions of the base to private businesses,
and will eventually pass along $7 million to the Army in sales
and/or lease proceeds.
  Sacramento's initial reuse plan called for confining the Army
to a single portion of the base, while finding new uses for the
2.5 million square feet of buildings on the site. The city
planned to spend $19 million to clear out or refurbish old
Army  buildings ("These buildings were built to very high
standards, and they cost a fortune to demolish," Farley said.) To
market the Depot to private businesses, the city would
subdivide the base into individual parcels of 40 to 80 acres
apiece, and eventually to sell the parcels to private businesses
for a total of $15 million.
  Sacramento's great stroke of luck was the Northridge
earthquake of January 1994, which dislodged Packard Bell
from its plant in Northridge and sent the company looking for
potential new sites in less seismically active areas. In July,
Packard Bell officials asked Sacramento officials to identify
possible locations. The strongest selling point for the depot  was
the inclusion of the Army Depot in a State Enterprise Zone
program, which allows employers to take a tax credit of $6,000
for every disadvantaged worker hired, according to Debra
Nyland, an assistant economic development director for the
city. The credits enabled the company to save between $2 and
$4 million annually, according to Nyland.
  The agreement between the city and the computer maker was
a 20-year lease for 2 million square feet of rehabbed space for
$50 million. Annual lease payments began at $5 million and
drop to $2.5 million after the fifth year. In the tenth year the
company has an option to buy the property for $7 million, or
extend the lease for 35 years at $1.25 million annually. For its
part, the city provided a $17 million loan for tenant
improvements, plus a $9 million loan as a moving allowance.
The rents are higher in the first five years, so the city can
recoup the moving loan, which "was fairly risky because it was
unsecured," Farley explained. The tenant improvement loan is
being amortized over 12 years of lease payments.
  The city also indemnified Packard Bell against any costs
relating to environmental issues. Although the military clearly
has the responsibility for any environmental clean-up issues
under CERCLA, the federal Superfund law, the company
apparently wanted additional assurance.
  (Separate from the deal, the city also paid $800,000 to
relocate Vietnam Veterans of California, which was using the
site under the McKinney Act. The city has also requested other
public agencies, which have priority to take space in former
military bases, to forego the depot.)
  The Packard Bell lease negotiation was remarkable for its
speed. The company and the city struck a deal in less than two
months, and in September 1994 the deal was approved by
state lawmakers in 18 days. Packard Bell took occupancy of the
buildings in November, almost a month before it signed the
lease in December.
  The deal is all gravy to the Army, which spends nothing and
actually saves $1 million annually in maintenance costs for the
Packard Bell facility.
  Farley describes the economic development conveyance as "a
great tool" for local governments. Cities, he said, are "in the
business of redeveloping properties through various programs
the state has created. We never had a tool to accomplish the
same tasks with military bases, so this really makes the city
into a player in the redevelopment of the base."
  Despite the national publicity on the success of the depot
conversion, Farley was quick to add that the city's work is not
done. "As you start to build new facilities, and add onto the
existing infrastructure of the base, it leads to certain problems."
One problem is a $1 million "catch up" fee that the Sacramento
County regional sewer plant is attempting to charge the base.
(When the Depot was a military base, it was exempted from
sewer fees. Now that the depot is under local control, the
sewage plant is attempting to bill the depot for all the fees it
had not paid while it was still under military control.)
  Listed for closure in 1991, the 480-acre Depot officially closed
in March. The Army remains on 80 acres of the facility.

LISTING OF SPECIES STALLED

  A Republican attempt to block new endangered species
listings by denying appropriations for the listing process has
been upheld by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The
decision is likely to hold up attempts to list more than 100
species in California alone.
  Overturning a district court judge's ruling, a three-judge panel
of the Ninth Circuit acknowledged that Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt missed the statutory deadline for making a decision on
whether to list the California red-legged frog as endangered.
But the court found that Babbitt "is unable to comply with his
listing duty under the Act" because Congress rescinded listing
funds in last year's appropriation and has continued the ban on
new listings in the continuing resolutions during this fiscal year
as well.
  The ruling came even though the statutory deadline for listing
the frog occurred before last year's appropriation bill was
passed.
  The ruling, written by Judge Betty Fletcher, contained a stern
warning against legislation by appropriation and stated that
the Endangered Species Act is still in full force despite the
appropriation bill. Quoting TVA v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153 (the so-
called "snail darter" case), Fletcher said: "Repeal of legislation
by implication is disfavored," especially when "the claimed
repeal rests solely in an Appropriations Act."
  Ultimately, however, Fletcher concluded that Babbitt was
prohibited from making a final determination by the terms of a
rider to the 1995 appropriation bill. "The use of any
government resources P whether salaries, employees, paper, or
buildings P to accomplish a final listing would entail
government expenditure," she wrote. "The government cannot
make expenditures and therefore cannot act, other than by
appropriation."
  The red-legged frog case was widely watched because the
listing process has been halted on 120 species in California and
240 nationwide.
  The 1995 appropriation bill specifically rescinded $1.5 million
allocated for listing and determination of critical habitat and
also stated that the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service cannot use any
other funds for this purpose. Originally passed on April 10,
1995, this rider has been contained in the continuing
resolutions passed to keep the government operating during
the recent budget negotiations.
  At the time the rider was passed, the Fish & Wildlife Service
was already engaged in lengthy litigation with the
Environmental Defense Center of Santa Barbara over the listing
of the red-legged frog. Under the Endangered Species Act,
Babbitt should have made a final determination on whether to
list the frog by July 19, 1993. When Babbitt missed the
deadline, EDC sued, but the two parties eventually agreed to a
settlement agreement requiring a final decision by November
1, 1993.
  Babbitt missed that deadline also, however, and EDC sued
again. Finally, the Fish & Wildlife Service published a proposed
listing on the Federal Register on February 2, 1994. Under the
Endangered Species Act, Babbitt then had one year P until
February 2, 1995 P to make a final decision on the listing.
Babbitt missed the deadline again, and EDC sued in May of
1995. By then, however, the appropriations rider was in effect.
  U.S. District Court Judge Manuel Real in Los Angeles issued
summary judgment in favor of the EDC and ordered Babbitt to
take a final action by September 15, 1995. However, the U.S.
Supreme Court issued a stay of this order and the Ninth Circuit
heard the case on an expedited schedule.
  In Fletcher's ruling, the Ninth Circuit ordered the final listing
"delayed until a reasonable time after appropriated funds are
made available" and ordered Real to establish the time frame.

STATE SUPREME COURT LAYS DOWN CC&R RULE

  The California Supreme Court has ruled that CC&Rs
(covenants, conditions, and restrictions) in two Woodside
subdivisions should be enforceable even though they are not
mentioned in the subdivisions' property deeds. In the process,
the court majority laid down a sweeping new rule to govern
the enforceability of private property covenants: If restrictions
are recorded before the sale of property, "the later purchaser is
deemed to agree with them."
  The controversial ruling may be the first step toward clearing
up a complicated real property law issue and is likely to have
an important impact on private land-use restrictions. "It's a
good decision," said UCLA law professor Susan French, one of
the leading scholars in the area of private covenants.
  But it may also lead to further confusion, because the court
declared that the new rule should be applied retrospectively
and because it declares that all information about a piece of
property need not be included in the deed. In a strong dissent,
Justice Joyce Kennard wrote that the ruling will transform
deeds "that on their face are unrestricted conveyances of the
landowner's entire interest into deeds conveying only a portion
of the landowner's interest." (French disputed Kennard's view,
saying that the restrictions will turn up in title reports.)
  The case drew the attention of many outside groups, including
the California Association of Realtors, the California Building
Industry Association, and the Coastal Commission, all of whom
intervened on behalf of the neighbors seeking to enforce the
CC&Rs. The Coastal Commission argued that if all CC&Rs must be
included in deeds, the agency's many not be able to enforce
conditions it imposes on new development projects along the
coast.
  The role of CC&Rs in land-use planning and regulation is
growing. Especially in California, more and more planned
communities are created with a "private" municipal
government made up of homeowner associations that enforce
private deed covenants.
  However, as CC&Rs have grown in number they have also
generated a lot of complicated litigation about how, when, and
by whom they can be enforced. French has called the law
surrounding CC&Rs "the most complex and archaic body of
American property law remaining in the 20th Century." Several
recent appellate court rulings have dealt with CC&Rs. Last
September, the Court of Appeal ruled that a homeowner
association may record a notice of violation with the county
recorder even though such actions are sometimes taken
because they are cheaper than suing the homeowner.
(California Riviera Homeowners Association v. Superior Court,
CP&DR Legal Digest, October 1995.) The Supreme Court
decertified this case shortly before issuing its ruling in the
Woodside case.
  The new case involves Jared and Anne Anderson, who bought
two parcels of property in Woodside and obtained a conditional
use permit from the city to operate a winery. The two parcels
were originally part of two separate subdivisions, each of
whose subdividers had recorded CC&Rs restricting the property
to residential use. Claiming that the Andersons had violated the
CC&Rs, a group of neighbors organized as the Citizens for
Covenant Compliance and sued the Andersons. However, the
Andersons claimed they had no knowledge of the CC&Rs
because there was no reference to them in the deeds of either
parcel they had purchased.
  San Mateo Superior Court Judge Harlan K. Veal ruled that the
CC&Rs were not enforceable, and the First District Court of
Appeal affirmed. But on a 6-1 vote, the Supreme Court
overturned the lower ruling and declared the covenants
enforceable despite the defects in the deed, establishing the
new rule in the process. "The CC&Rs of this case were recorded
before any of the parcels were sold ... they state an intent to
establish a general plan for the subdivisions binding on all
purchasers and their successors; and they describe the
property they are to govern," wrote Justice Armand Arabian
for the majority. "...Therefore ... the fact that the individual
deeds do not reference them is not fatal to their enforceability."
  To arrive at the new rule, Justice Arabian's majority opinion
reached deep into the legal history of easements, covenants,
and equitable servitude (sometimes known as restrictive
covenants), all of which seek to govern the enforceability of
private land use restrictions. Traditionally, a covenant is a
restriction that "runs with the land" because it affects the use
of the land in some way.  Beginning in the 19th Century,
English and then American courts adopted the doctrine of
equitable servitude, which permits enforceability of covenants
that would not be strictly enforceable under the doctrine of
covenants. Because the Woodside covenants impose a burden
on the property P rather than simply a benefit P and because
they are agreed to between grantor and grantee P rather than
between landowners P they fall under the doctrine of equitable
servitude and not covenants.
  Legal scholars have noted that legal doctrines surrounding
covenants and equitable servitude are similar and perhaps
should be combined. California law treats them similarly, and
in the majority opinion Arabian stated that the Supreme
Court's new rule should apply equally to both doctrines.
  In reaching his conclusions on the Woodside case, Arabian
said that the basic issue was not whether the restrictions run
with the land but whether they ever took effect in the first
place given the fact that they are not mentioned in the deeds.
The Andersons argued that the CC&Rs never took effect
because they were not mentioned in the deeds. But Arabian
said that accepting this argument would lead to "byzantine"
results. What if some deeds included the CC&Rs and others did
not? According to case law, he concluded, any property sold
subsequent to the first property whose deed mentioned the
CC&Rs would be subject to the CC&Rs P even if the particular
deed in question did not mention them. Claiming that this
greatly complicates title searches, Arabian said the result
would be a "crazy-quilt pattern of uses."
  In laying down the new rule, Arabian stated: "The overall
plan, and not individual deeds, should determine what
restrictions are in effect, and between whom." He also
concluded that the rule should apply retrospectively.
  In her dissent, Justice Kennard wrote that the new rule "blasts
a gaping hole through the structure of real property law that
has been painstakingly erected by the Legislature and by the
courts over the past century." She said that the rule will allow
"for the unilateral creation of enforceable land use restrictions,
contrary to established law," and that it will deny constructive
notice to land purchasers under state law. She also stated that
retrospective application of the new rule will wreak havoc
throughout the state. Noting that land subdivision in California
dates back to the 1860s, she said: "If the subdivider of any of
these thousands of lands recorded a plan of common
restrictions for the lots but conveyed the lots by unrestricted
grant deeds, retroactive application of the majority's new rule
will now bring those restrictions to life no matter how long
they have lain dormant."

APPELLATE COURT STRIKES DOWN FRESNO-AREA ARTS TAX

  Fresno's so-called "Arts-to-Zoo" tax violates the California
constitution because the organization that administers the tax
is a private entity, the Fifth District Court of Appeal has ruled.
  The Fresno Metropolitan Projects Authority was created by
the state legislature in 1993 as a vehicle for administering a
1/10-cent sales tax in the Freno area for cultural facilities.
Fresno-area voters approved the tax by a 57% majority in
1993. Under the Government Code, half of the tax proceeds are
distributed to the local zoo, the philharmonic orchestra, and
two museums, 25% are distributed for cultural programs, and
25% are distributed for a variety of other purposes including
capital improvements for cultural facilities. The authority is
governed by a 13-member board. As specified in the law, the
city and the county each choose one board member. The other
11 members are selected by such organizations as the Parent
Teachers Association, the Chamber of Commerce, the local
taxpayers association, the Farm Bureau, the Fresno-Madera
Central Labor Council, the League of Mexican-American
Women, the West Fresno Ministerial Alliance, and the local
division of the California Retired Teachers Association.
  The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association sued and claimed
that the state law creating the authority was a violation of
Article XI, section 11 of the state constitution, which prohibits
the legislature from delegating the power to tax to a private
entity. Fresno County Superior Court Judge Stephen J. Kane
ruled in favor of the Jarvis group and the Fifth District affirmed
his ruling.
  Before the Fifth District, the Metropolitan Authority made a
series of arguments, including the argument that it is a public
body because it performs public functions. But the court
pointed out that only two of its 13 board members are
appointed by public bodies. "The electorate cannot remove
those who are chosen as director of the Authority and the
electorate cannot remove those who choose," wrote Presiding
Justice James Ardaiz for the court. "But the electorate must
bear the consequences of the decisions of those who compose
the authority. ... As we see it this is a distinction that marks the
Authority as a private body."
  The Metropolitan Authority also argued that the tax was
levied by the people and not by the Authority, but the court
rejected that argument, stating that the law specifically
authorizes the Authority to levy the tax. The court also
concluded that voter approval did not render the constitutional
provision inapplicable to this particular tax, as the Authority
claimed.
  "The voters have no say in the matter of fund distribution for
the next 20 years short of repeal of the entire tax," wrote
Ardaiz. "This appears to us to be precisely the type of situation
the framers sought to avoid by prohibiting the delegation to a
private body of the power to tax."
  Finally, Ardaiz rejected the Metropolitan Authority's
argument that its "regional" nature exempts it from the
constitutional provision in question. The court's review of case
law, he concluded, "leads us to conclude that the present article
XI, section 11 means just what it says: that the  Legislature
may not delegate to a private person or body the power to levy
taxes. The section does not contain any exception for any
particular type of tax, 'regional' or otherwise."

SUPP EIS NOT NEEDED FOR DOPPLER WEATHER STATION

  The federal government did not need to prepare a
supplemental environmental impact statement for a Doppler
weather radar tower atop Sulfur Mountain in Ventura County,
the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled.
  Environmental review of the weather station was challenged
by the Environmental Coalition of Ojai and two individual Ojai
residents including actor Larry Hagman. Among other things,
the Environmental Coalition claimed that the federal
government should have prepared a supplemental EIS just for
the Ojai site and that other environmental documents should
have been updated to reflect new research about the
environmental health dangers of radiation from the weather
system. However, the Environmental Coalition has lost the case
all the way down the line and the Sulfur Mountain facility is
now in operation.
  The Sulfur Mountain station is part of the National Weather
Service's national modernization program known as NEXRAD
(for Next Generation Weather Radar). The system is being
constructed jointly by the Commerce, Transportation, and
Defense departments. Doppler radar systems must be located
away from "electronic pollution" contained in metropolitan
areas.
  The Environmental Coalition originally asked U.S. District
Court Judge Terry Hatter to enjoin construction of the project
but he refused and eventually he granted summary judgment
in favor of the government. The Court of Appeals affirmed his
ruling.
  The NEXRAD system has been the subject of a long series of
environmental documents, including a programmatic EIS and a
supplemental environmental assessment, which examined the
environmental impact generally and the radiation issue
specifically. Based on this information, the government chose
not to produce a supplemental EIS for the NEXRAD program
and instead filed a finding of no significant impact, or FONSI, in
1993. (A FONSI is the equivalent of a negative declaration
under the National Environmental Policy Act.)
  With regard to the Sulphur Mountain site, the government
produced an initial environmental assessment in 1986 and an
in-depth site survey in 1987 and as a result of those
documents issued a FONSI for the site in 1989.
  The Environmental Coalition's case contained two key
components. First, the Coalition argued that the government
should have prepared a site-specific EIS for the Sulfur
Mountain site. And second, the Environmental Coalition argued
that the government should have done a supplemental EIS for
the whole NEXRAD program after new research on the radiation
became known.
  In ruling for the government, the Ninth Circuit relied heavily
on the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Marsh v. Oregon Natural
Resources Council, 490 U.S. 360 (1989). In that case, the court
concluded that the federal government need not prepare a site-
specific EIS for every federal project. In the Sulfur Mountain
case, Judge Arthur Alarcon, writing for the Ninth Circuit, said:
"In its 1986 and 1987 site-specific EAs (environmental
assessments), the Government considered the environmental
impact of the NEXRAD installation on Sulfur Mountain. Having
determined that the Sulfur Mountain NEXRAD installation
would have no significant local environmental impact, the
government reasonably issued a FONSI in 1989 instead of
preparing a site-specific EIS."
  On the question of a supplemental EIS on the radiation issues,
Alarcon listed a long set of materials reviewed by the
government in its supplemental environmental assessment. "In
each instance," Alarcon wrote, "the Government found that
although initial studies suggested an association between RFR
[radar radiation] and ... diseases, more rigorous subsequent
studies either failed to confirm the initial results or yielded
negative findings." Based on this review the government
concluded that the radiation would not be an environmental
health hazard. "Accordingly, its previous conclusion that the
weather stations would have no significant adverse
environmental impact (published in the preliminary EIS)
remained valid," Alarcon wrote. "Therefore, the Government
determined that it was not necessary to prepare a
supplemental EIS."
  The court also rejected the Environmental Coalition's
argument that the government had failed to provide adequate
notice for the environmental documentation on both the radar
system generally and the Sulfur Mountain facility. The Ninth
Circuit concluded that Ojai citizens were not required to receive
specific notice on the nationwide system issues, and that the
government had satisfied notice requirements on the local
issues by filling documents  with state and local clearinghouses.
  The Case:
  Environmental Coalition of Ojai v. Brown, No. 94-56164, 96
Daily Journal D.A.R. 40 (January 2, 1996).
  The Lawyers:
  For Environmental Coalition of Ojai: Dale G. Givner, (805) 485-
4454.

Attorney, (213) 894-2451.

ECONOMYUS UP, BUT CONSTRUCTION ISNUT

  After showing signs of a rebound in 1994, California's
construction industry slid back into decline in 1995, reviving a
five-year dip in building activity in California. The renewed
slump confirms the break in relationship between building and
the rest of the economy here, and draws into question a range
of community development dictums that revolve around
growth.
  Two years ago, we announced that the sector that once set the
course of economic trends had instead become a follower
(CP&DR Numbers, January 1994). Last year, we reported that
construction experienced its first growth year in the last six
(CP&DR Numbers, January 1995.) All three sectors (residential,
non-residential, and heavy) experienced increases in total
construction dollars in 1994 relative to 1993, indicating that, at
long last, the building industry had rebounded.
  As it turned out, 1995 was the year that entertainment and
bio-tech replaced a goodly portion of the jobs lost in the
aerospace/defense industry, the year that home prices actually
began to climb in some of the state's zip codes, and the year
when even aerospace/defense saw some job growth linked to a
revival of some B-2 and  McDonnell Douglas passenger jet
orders. But the building industry took a dive again. With 10
months of data in hand, the Construction Industry Research
Board is forecasting a retraction year in total construction
dollars, led by slides in residential and heavy construction.
  If there is any economic bright spot, it is that the $29.9 billion
spent last year did not drop to the 13-year record low year of
1993, when only $28.8 billion were spent. The other positive
statistic is the employment data: though total construction
dollars are down, construction jobs enjoyed a second straight
year of growth.
  This is all quite confounding for industry watchers such as
Ben Bartolotto of the CIRB. After all, a year ago he had
predicted an 11.8% increase, rather than the 1.7% drop he now
estimates. (Final numbers will be available in March. ) "All of
the dynamics were in place: job growth, drops in vacancy P the
drop is frustrating," Bartolotto said. The job growth data
apparently reflects ongoing reconstruction or renovation that
does not show up in regular construction figures.
  Bartolotto suspects that the disconnect between employment
and housing demand may be resulting from lower levels of real
personal income compared to, say, 10 years ago. And this time,
L.A. cannot be blamed for holding the state back: of the 25
markets surveyed by CIRB, Los Angeles-Long Beach, along with
San Francisco and Santa Barbara County, were the only housing
markets that increased housing construction from 1994 to
1995. Rates from other types of construction varied widely be
region, but one thing has emerged as constant: the building
industry is not a reliable indicator of economic health in
California. And a healthy economy does not necessarily
translate into a booming building industry.
  The lesson may be an important one for planners, who should
P now more than ever P think about implementing community
goals in ways that do not rely on new construction activity.
  Which brings us to the forecast for building in 1996: Does
anybody still care? Once again, the CIRB calls for a comeback
year, with an 11.9% increase in overall dollar spent. This is
expected to be paced by a strong surge in housing construction,
with a 29.8% increase in activity over 1995. Cynical as one is
tempted to become about such forecasts, it is true that the
housing industry seems to be poised for some kind of
turnaround. Analysts have been saying that the pent-up
demand for housing may find an outlet as potential buyers
come to market in order to avoid the 2.5% increase in prices
expected in 1996. But one thing we have learned: We won't
draw any conclusions about the larger economy based on the
construction industry.

REMAKING DOWNTOWN FRESNO

  The Fulton District in Downtown Fresno has much in common
with other aging city centers across the state: high vacancy
rates in older buildings, out-of-date infrastructure, inadequate
parking, a perception of crime, and a general lack of vital
pedestrian activity. The district also has a number of positive
attributes, including a number of existing cultural institutions,
most notably the Fresno Metropolitan Museum, which attracts
250,000 visitors annually.
  The "Met," as it is known locally, is in an expansion mode, and
museum directors have acknowledged that a bigger and better
Met needs to be supported by other institutions in the
immediate area. The notion of a cultural district was already
suggested in the downtown master plan created in 1993 by
developer Wayne Ratkovich, and some city officials view the
area as the cultural center not only for the city but for a 125-
mile radius of the San Joaquin Valley. A team of consultants,
made up of Keyser Marston Associates, Barry Howard Limited,
and RTKL Associates Inc., have proposed a cultural district,
with the Met serving as the nucleus, surrounded by at least six
other museum or museum expansion sites, including new
locations for the Afro-American Museum and Arte de
Americas.
  The cultural district would be buttressed by an
entertainment/retail district immediately southwest, anchored
by that tried-and-true generator of urban foot traffic: a multi-
plex cinema, which is expected to bring in 1 million people
annually. The pedestrian quality of the cultural district could
benefit from another proposal to convert one-way streets to
two-directional traffic. Neo-traditional designers favor two-
way traffic as a means to slow traffic and make streets more
comfortable for pedestrians, although few cities have had the
gumption to convert one-way streets P a favorite of traffic
planners P back to two-way traffic.
  A strength of the plan is the high number of existing and
proposed museums oriented on Van Ness Avenue. The plan
identifies at least two vacant lots on important thoroughfares
as parking sites, which could blight the experience for
pedestrians, unless the parking structures incorporate street-
level retail. The plan has been approved by the museum's
board of directors, and is awaiting a vote by the Fresno city
council.
  1. The Fresno Metropolitan Museum. This well-attended
institution is the anchor of the area, and seeks to expand into
neighboring buildings (2) and (3).
  4. A multi-plex theater is the "traffic generator" of the Fulton
District, and is hoped to attract up enough visitors to activate"
the downtown district. To handle the parking, the museums
and other buildings would make parking available to the
theater on evenings and weekends.
  5. Multi-plex parking.
  6. Proposed future site of the Asian Museum.
  7. Proposed future site of the Afro-American Museum.
  8. Proposed future site of Arte de Americas.
  9. Fulton Street. Two-way traffic is proposed for this one-way
street.
  10. Van Ness Avenue.
  11. Existing theaters: the Wilson and the Warnor.
  12. Proposed museum/museum expansion sites.
  13. Proposed surface parking.
  14. Fulton Street.
