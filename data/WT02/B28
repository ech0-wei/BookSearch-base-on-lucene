The Liberty Boat</H1><H3>Nathan Kripz</H3><H5>Nathan Kripz is a freelance journalist working in Ireland. He is especially concerned with religious issues and current affairs.</H5><BR><BR>
Though I am from a Jewish background, my late father's experiences as a naval commander during the war persuaded him that if there was a great fairy in the sky he, she or it was a damned fool. He therefore became a born again evangelical atheist and raised me as a secular Jew, i.e. one who though made aware of his ethnic origins and identity was not smothered in religious gobbledegook. Accordingly, I grew up without the hindrance of undue pressure to accept irrational mythological philosophies and was therefore in a position from a fairly early age, as soon in fact as I became aware of wider social and moral issues, to appraise the respective arguments for myself without any preconceptions to cloud my judgement and colour my conclusions.<BR><BR>Consequently, while still in my teens, I had formulated a rational personal philosophy about many matters, among them issues relating to death and dying. It seemed to me that if the consensus in society was that it was humane and appropriate to put a seriously injured or terminally ill dog painlessly out of its misery, them there could not possibly be any objection to applying the same principle to a human animal. The vast difference of course is that whereas the dog would have the decision taken for it as it would be capable neither of considering the implication of such a decision nor voicing an opinion, the human animal, being possessed of reason, intellect and communication skills, would ideally prefer to be personally involved in any such decision, particularly as there might always be the possibility that any one making such a decision for another person might not always be giving selfless consideration to the genuine needs of that individual.<BR><BR>My father died almost twenty years ago and for the last three years of his life he existed in mental anguish. The ravages of Alzheimer's disease reduced this once strong and dignified character to a pathetic shell. His memory became so erratic that if he managed to leave the house unaccompanied he could never find his way back. Frequently he failed to recognize me and spent hours looking for Rusty, his long dead cocker spaniel. He was always very helpful about the house and usually assisted Mum by preparing the vegetables for the evening meal. However his sense of time disappeared and one night we found him downstairs around 3.00AM peeling potatoes. As if that was not bad enough, the sink was full of blood where he was quite obviously peeling as much skin off his fingers as off the potatoes. During another night I nearly flattened him. My wife and I were lying in bed sound asleep when we both awoke with a start and realised there was a prowler in the bedroom. I jumped out of bed and was just about to administer a general anaesthetic with my fist when a feeble little voice said "It's only me - I'm taking the watch tonight". Dad was back in the Navy and we started sleeping with the door locked.<BR><BR>I am a musician and used to spend a great deal of time at home, especially in the mornings, practising, arranging scores and meeting pupils or other musicians. Dad would come into my studio when I was working to ask me to fasten his shoes or to put a knot in his tie. He would then sit on, rendering work virtually impossible. He kindly produced a cup of tea on one occasion. Unfortunately he neglected to first boil the water.<BR><BR>One day I had to go into town to pick up some music. On returning shortly after 11.00 AM I was greeted with a rather pungent odour. Facing me on the stairs was a trail of excrement culminating in a pair of none too wholesome trousers on the landing outside the bathroom. The lavatory and walls were plastered with the stuff and dear old Dad was nowhere to be seen. I went downstairs and found him in the kitchen attempting to wash his underpants in the sink which was clogged and overflowing. "Oh, hello Son - I've had a little accident", with a smile. I wept.<BR><BR>That was the last straw. I rang our GP and arranged for Dad to go into hospital. Two days later he was admitted to a geriatric unit where he was to remain until he died about eighteen months later. While he was in hospital he suffered a series of minor strokes. We were summoned by staff with such frequency that we began to think he would never die. After three nocturnal calls in as many weeks we told the staff that in future if we received a call during the night we would not come out until the morning. It was following such a call that he eventually died, just under an hour before we arrived at the hospital.<BR><BR>On the many frequent occasions when we visited him we frequently thought that if ever there was an undeniable argument in favour of euthanasia, or assisted suicide, this was it. Sometimes he was lying in bed weak, helpless and uncomprehending. At other times he was conscious and moving about, but clearly confused and frankly, not my Dad. But worst of all were the few occasions on which we briefly got a glimpse of the man he once was.<BR><BR>One such occurrence took place on Christmas Day, the year before he died. I offered to play the organ in the hospital chapel for their carol service and afterwards I visited Dad in his villa. He looked straight at me and said "Son, I hate this place. I wish I was dead." Our eyes filled up and we both began to sob.<BR><BR>Long after Dad's death I used to ponder the question "What if the doctors caring for my father had been able to assist him to die with dignity?" I found this question often led to other questions, such as "What if his doctors had suggested to me that it might be timely to end Dad's suffering?", or "What if I had found the courage to assist him to commit suicide?" But, another question which I found a little frightening was "Do I want Dad to be released from his suffering or from mine?" You see, some times there is a danger of looking at some one you love, who is slowly dying and in great distress, and to feel such personal pain at their condition that you want them to die because you just cannot bear another minute of it. This unfortunately is only a small step away from desiring some one's death because they have become objectionable or a nuisance to look after, or costly to maintain and perhaps eating into possible legacies.<BR><BR>It is to protect against this extra step and to minimise the possibility of any one being coerced either actively or inactively into agreeing to euthanasia that any possible legislation must be very carefully worded. Not only should the right to die in dignity be recognized and upheld by law, but the individual consciences of those persons who may be called upon to assist in acts of euthanasia, either by authorising, supplying, prescribing or procuring the means, advising on methodology, counselling or administering, must be honoured and protected. We must also recognize that for some people dying in dignity may mean seeing it through to the end. Their consciences too must be honoured and protected, and if that means providing hospices and extreme medical care then that is as it must be.<BR><BR>Those of us who believe that we have a right to determine when our own lives are no longer worth living due to unbearable physical or mental suffering, have a right to do so, but if we are to be taken seriously and not to be labelled as dangerous cranks we must rely upon the voice of gentle persuasion and afford alternative viewpoints the same respect we seek.<BR><BR>Once when I was visiting Dad he said "Hello Nathan, I haven't seen you for a while" (I visited him twice a week); "I'm just waiting for the liberty boat". That was the name given to the boat which took officers and crew from ship to shore and leave. I do not know if he really recognized me as his second officer, after whom I was named, was also called Nathan, but I thought "Dad, I hope your liberty boat comes in soon". It did, about three years too late. <BR><BR>

<h3><BR>Cheryl K. Smith</h3>
</CENTER>
<HR>


<cite>
Cheryl K Smith is Legal Services Director, Oregon Rehabilitation Association and was a primary drafter of the Oregon Death With Dignity Act. She has written extensively on death and dying and has been an Honorary Research Associate to VESS since working as Interim Director and Staff Attorney for Hemlock. Here she examines the historic U.S. Judgement that has rocked the movement around the world. How did it reach its conclusions?
</cite>

<hr>

Delighting right to die advocates and shocking opponents, on 7 March 1996, the 9th Circuit Federal Court ruled 8-3 that Washington state's law which prohibits "aiding" in suicide violates the US Constitution. This was the first ruling by a federal appeals court in support of physician-assisted suicide. It opens the door for doctors to begin responding to requests from dying patients to help end their suffering. It also may accelerate removal of the injunction that has held up the implementation of Oregon's Death with Dignity Act for the past year and a half.
<br><br>
Although technically confined to the nine states within the 9th Circuit's jurisdiction, the detailed analysis of the arguments at such a high level is sure to reverberate in courts around the world.
<br><br>
Judge Stephen Reinhardt noted in the ruling that the decision applies only to "the prescription of life-ending medication for use by terminally ill, competent adult patients who wish to hasten their deaths." The opinion did not reach the issue of whether physicians may administer such drugs. Despite that, anti-euthanasia campaigners immediately began painting pictures of the involuntary euthanasia of innocents they claim will occur if we allow dying people to "determine the time and manner" of their death.
<br><br>
US District Judge Barbara Rothstein, in 1994, had previously ruled the Washington law unconstitutional, but a three-judge panel of the appeals court had overrruled that decision a year ago in a 2-1 decision. In an unusual turn of events, a majority of the entire appeals court then voted to refer the case to the 11-judge panel for a rehearing, and this ultimately generated the affirmation of Judge Rothstein's original decision.
<br><br>
The well-reasoned and comprehensive majority opinion ( Compassion in Dying v. State of Washington, No. 94-35534), is morethan 100 pages in length. While the decision is significant in itself and is expected to be widely cited throughout the United States, it applies directly only to those states and territories in the 9th Circuit - Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Guam and the Northern Marianas. As a result the decision had no effect on the concurrent trial of Dr. Kevorkian.(1)
<br><br>
In arriving at its holding, the court first had to determine whether a liberty interest in choosing the time and manner of one's death exists, and then to balance that against any state interests. It relied heavily on previous abortion cases to make out a liberty interest, in particular Planned Parenthood v. Casey.(2) Casey characterized the type of liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment as a matter "involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime," a choice that is "central to personal dignity and autonomy".(3) This writer believes that to be a very apt description of the right to choose to end one's life when suffering a terminal illness.
<br><br>
<h3>Finding a liberty interest</h3>

Here we need to examine the technical methods which the court used to navigate through the ethical and legal minefields.
<br><br>
In order to determine whether a liberty interest exists, the court relied on a "substantive due process test", first used in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), a famous contraceptives case.(4) Under such an analysis, interests are seen on a continuum, where "the more important a right or interest, the more persuasive the justifications for infringement" must be.
<br><br>
This is in contrast to what may be referred to as a multi-tiered scrutiny approach, in which interests are first determined to be "fundamental" or "nonfundamental" and then the standard for review is applied. If a right is considered fundamental, the level of review - called "strict scrutiny" - requires that an overriding state interest be "compelling" and "necessary" to achieve the end. In other cases only a rational relationship between the statute and legitimate state interest is required to find the statute constitutional.(5)
<br><br>
The court noted, however, that whether the substantive due process test or the multi-tiered approach is used, the interest in this case clearly rises beyond the level at which the lesser rational basis review is appropriate.
<br><br>
The court goes on to note that previous failure to recognize the existence of a certain liberty interest, or even previous prohibition of its exercise, does not preempt recognitionof its existence. They cite laws previously overturned, including those against interracial marriage and abortion. This parallels the situation with laws against assisted suicide, which currently exist in over half of the states. Clearly, acceptance or prohibition of practices in the past alone is not enough to preempt recognition of a liberty interest relating to those practices in the present.
<br><br>
As part of the inquiry regarding whether the right to assisted suicide is an important liberty interest, the court provides an extensive review of the history of suicide and how it was viewed in various cultures.
<br><br>
Rather than being totally prohibited throughout history, suicide has been considered acceptable, if not honorable, at times. Even when disapproved of, exceptions existed. The most notable exception appears over and over throughout this review - in cases where an individual is suffering from illness. Even while it may have been considered wrong, or resulting from a mental disorder, in most states neither suicide nor attempted suicide has been criminalized since the turn of the century; and no state currently prohibits either by means of statute. 
<br><br>
After discussing recent polls that indicate societal approval of suicide or assisted suicide in cases of terminal illness, and comparing the refusal of treatment to assisted suicide, the majority moves its analysis to prior relevant court decisions which were decided between 1925 and the present.
<br><br>
All these cases involved "decisions that are highly personal and intimate, as well of great importance to the individual", and the court correctly noted that "few decisions are more personal, intimate or important than the decision to end one's life, especially when the reason for doing so is to avoid excessive and protracted pain." They rest their conclusion that "a liberty interest in controlling the time and manner of one's death is a protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment", citing two major cases - Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 112 S. Ct. 2791 (1992) and Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dept. Of Health, 497 U.S. 261 (1990) (this latter was the historic case that lead to the introduction of living will legislation and concerned a woman in persistent vegetative state after a car crash).
<br><br>
The language of Casey, which reasserted the liberty interest of women in obtaining an abortion, is most persuasive in making the case that such decisions are protected by the Due Process Clause:
<br><br>
"These matters, involving the intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. At the heartof liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of the State."
<br><br>
Although that case was referring to abortion, the language could have easily have been about the right to choose to die. In fact, an arguably stronger case exists in this context, because only the individual whose life it is, not a fetus, is implicated in the decision.
<br><br>
Further supporting the court's contention that such decisions are protected was the Nancy Cruzan case, which dealt with the refusal of unwanted medical treatment. The court concluded that "Cruzan, by recognizing a liberty interest that includes the refusal of artificial provision of life-sustaining food and water, necessarily recognizes a liberty interest in hastening one's own death." Because the intent in both cases is death, with the only difference being that one patient is being maintained by artificial life support and the other not, it logically follows that both would be encompassed by such a liberty interest.
<br><br>
<h3>Balancing interests</h3>

The court goes on to identify six state interests that must be balanced against an individual's liberty interest in controlling the time and manner of his or her death. These include:
<br><br>
<li>A general interest in preserving life

<li>An interest in preventing suicide

<li>An interest in avoiding the involvement of third parties and in precluding the use of arbitrary, unfair, or undue influence

<li>An interest in protecting family members and loved ones

<li>An interest in protecting the integrity of the medical profession

<li>An interest in avoiding adverse consequences that might ensue if the statutory provision at issue is declared unconstitutional.

I will touch on the court's response to some of these issues below.

<h3>Preserving life</h3>

According to the majority, the state's general interest in preserving life is not always the most important factor, and may vary in strength according to the particular case. The individual's medical condition and his or her wishes are particularly important. The court harkened back to the "living will" statute, which determined that the state's interest in preserving life should give way to the wishes of a competent, terminally ill adult who refuses medical treatment.
<br><br>
As they so aptly put it, "When patients are no longer able to pursue liberty or happiness and do not wish to pursue life, the state's interest in forcing them to remain alive is clearly less compelling." They did not, however, rule out the imposition of safeguards on decision making.

<h3>Preventing suicide</h3>

In justifying its statute, the state of Washington relied primarily on the argument that its interest in preventing suicide outweighs the interest of a competent, terminally ill individual to commit suicide. The court found this interest a relatively easy obstacle to overcome, by reasoning that "not only is the state's interest in preventing such individuals from hastening their deaths of comparatively little weight, but its insistence on frustrating their wishes seems cruel indeed."
<br><br>
In analyzing the issue of whether physicians should be allowed to assist patients, the court carefully elaborated on the evolving ethical and legal line-drawing that has taken place over the years, and concluded that just as "ordinary" versus "extraordinary" treatment are not valid distinctions, neither is the distinction between "double effect" and physician assisted suicide. In a similar vein, they reasoned (disingenuously perhaps) that just as termination of tube feeding is not to be considered "suicide", neither should "terminally ill patients taking medication prescribed by their doctors" be so labelled.(6)
<br><br>
They also gave credence to the phenomenon well-known to those of us in the right to die movement of dying individuals choosing not to end their lives when they are secure in the knowledge that they have the means to do so if desired.

<h3>Avoiding involvement of 3rd parties and undue influence</h3>

In discussing these two areas of concern, the court focused mainly on i)the various slippery slope arguments that the dissenting judges found so enticing, ii)the argument that we must first have universal health care, and iii)the claim that physicians will become hardened to death, rejecting them all.

<h3>Protecting Families</h3>

The court rightly noted that "witnessing a loved one suffer a slow and agonizing death as a result of state compulsion is more likely to harm than further the interests of innocent third parties." Although not mentioned, I would add that knowing your dying loved one is planning to end his or her life with a doctor's assistance is also likely to be much lessshocking and painful than finding the results of a failed or violent suicide.

<h3>Protecting the integrity of the medical profession</h3>

The court concluded that the integrity of the medical profession is not at risk with lawful physician-assisted suicide for the terminally ill. They noted that the current situation criminalizes attending to the needs of patients and so creates conflict with professionalism, or making criminals of compassionate doctors whom we know are now helping their patients.
<br><br>
Recognizing the right to assisted-suicide would not mandate that doctors do anything contrary to their ethics either, according to the court.

<h3>Balancing</h3>

In balancing these interests against the liberty interest, the court first considered the strength of the liberty interest in this case. They found that "when a mentally competent adult is terminally ill, and wishes, free of any coercion, to hasten his death because his remaining days are an unmitigated torture, that person's liberty interest is at its height." 
<br><br>
Conversely, the court found that the state interests were "for the most part at a low point" in this case. They also noted that the interests in preventing assisted suicide were "different only in degree and not in kind from its interests in prohibiting a number of other medical practices that lead directly to a terminally ill patient's death."
<br><br>
In applying the balancing test, the judges were convinced, in part, by "specific testimony involving individual patients" (see sidebar), as well as various publicized accounts of individuals who were unable to obtain a doctor's assistance, that the statute was unconstitutionally burdensome. A state may make reasonable regulations to promote the state interests but not make a blanket prohibition.
<br><br>
While not prescribing specific regulations that would pass scrutiny under the Constitution, the majority did refer to the Oregon Death with Dignity Act and other model acts, as well as mentioning a number of procedural safeguards that might be appropriate. These include witnessing, a waiting period, second medical opinion, psychological examinations, and reporting requirements to prevent abuse.
<br><br>
Finally, the court considered the decision in the case of Lee v. State of Oregon, 891 F.Supp. 11429 (D. Or. 1995), which held the Oregon Death with Dignity Act to be unconstitutional. They felt that the reasoning of Judge Hogan was incorrect, noting that it was antithetical to their own reasoning. 
<br><br>
Specifically, they stated: "The Oregon District Court's reasoning conflicts squarely with the reasoning of this opinion and the legal conclusions we have reached. Here, we determine that a statute that prohibits doctors from aiding terminally ill persons to hasten their deaths by providing them with prescription medications unconstitutionally burdens the liberty interests of the terminally ill. The benefit we conclude the terminally ill are entitled to receive in this case--the right to physician-assisted suicide--is precisely what Judge Hogan determined to be a burden and thus unlawful. In short, Lee treats a burden as a benefit and a benefit as a burden. In doing so, Judge Hogan clearly erred. Lee not only does not aid us in reaching our decision, it is directly contrary to our holding."
<br><br>
<h3>Dissents and other problems</h3>

In addition to procedural issues, which I will not discuss here, the three dissenting judges in the case gave a variety of reasons why the Washington state law should not be considered unconstitutional.
<br><br>
These include usurpation of the rights of states to regulate the practice of medicine, a version of the slippery slope argument, a claim that the public disapproves of suicide as evidenced by current laws, and most worrisome, that no fundamental right is implicated, and the abortion cases cited by the majority to justify its use of substantive due process analysis actually reflected the Supreme Court's attempt to abide by previous decisions.

<br><br>At least one commentator has expresssed concern over the court's use of the substantive due process standard in this case, because it is vague, appears to be based on the values of the judges that made the decision, and is related to an historical abuse of judicial power.(7) While such fears may be valid, another equally valid concern is that if the decision is appealed, the Supreme Court will characterize the right at issue here in such a way as to deem it not fundamental.
<br><br>
In fact, in his dissent Judge Beezer suggests that inquiry in this case should be whether we have a "fundamental right to commit physician-assisted suicide" rather than the right to control the time and manner of one's death identified by the majority.
<br><br>
He also mentions a notoriously wrong-headed opinion by a severely divided Supreme Court in 1986, Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186, as a basis for his conclusions.8 In that case, the court indicated a reluctance to expand the rights that are considered fundamental. In order to be recognized as fundamental, an interest would have to be essential to ordered liberty and be "deeply rooted in history and tradition." Clearly, physician assisted suicide for people with terminal illness would fail the latter test, just as the right to abortion would have failed had the same requirements been applied when Roe v. Wade (the abortion case at the root of current American law on termination) was decided.

<h3>Where are we now?</h3>

We undoubtedly have not heard the end of the debate on the law of physician-assisted suicide in the United States, despite this historic ruling.
<br><br>
A similar appeal of a negative ruling has been made to the 2nd Circuit District Court in New York and on a similar statute. If that Circuit's ruling conflicts with this one, we can expect the U.S. Supreme Court to settle the issue. In addition, if the Washington Attorney General decides to appeal this case to the Supreme Court, we could potentially see a temporary injunction against physician-assisted suicide as well as a different ruling. As to Oregon's Death with Dignity Act, it has been sent back to Judge Hogan by the 9th Circuit for a rehearing. It, too, may end up with the U.S. Supreme Court.
<br><br>
Two of the nine states covered by the 9th Circuit Court, Nevada and Idaho, have no law against assisted suicide on the books; all the others do. Only one of the states - Oregon - has a statute that regulates physician-assisted suicide for the terminally ill, and it is enjoined from implementation. 
<br><br>
Both right to die advocates and opponents now have an opportunity, and even a sense of urgency, to work together to assure that physician-assisted suicide legislation with reasonable regulations and adequate safeguards is passed.

<hr>ADDENDA:
<br><br>
The Attorney-General of Washington State lodged an appeal to the US Supreme Court on 25th March against the March 6, l996, decision of the 9th Circuit Appeal Court that the Washington state law forbidding physician-assisted suicide for the terminally ill is unconstitional. (Whether the Supreme Court chooses to take the case remains to be seen, but given its controversial nature it is most likely to.)
<br><br>
Judge Michael Hogan has denied the motion to immediately dismiss his injunction blocking Measure 16 (The Oregon Death With Dignity Act, permitting physician-assisted suicide, approved by voters in l994). Instead he has scheduled a full hearing for April 24 to hear arguments for and against dismissal of the injunction in the Eugene Federal District Court. (The 9th Circuit said on March 6 that his ruling was wrong in law.)

Mounting evidence suggests that living wills only work when part of a communication process. Relying on the document alone is not enough. Taken into hospital on Christmas Day, the husband of one of this country's greatest living will campaigners, died two days later. We are privileged to tell his story.</cite></center>
<br><br>
Albert Goodheir, former minister, Esperanto expert and author, died at age 83 "in accordance with his living will." The phrase was picked up by newspapers around the country. To his devoted wife Phyllis, the moment was wonderful, even though doctors had pleaded to give him surgery: "I told the doctors, `I want to let him go.' I repeated it a second time, `Let him go.' He didn't suffer and I didn't suffer because we knew that was what he wanted. It was wonderful because he died in peace. His death was a joyous occasion."

<center><h3><cite><font color="blue">"As his quality of life disappeared, he was sustained by a deep belief in the emptiness of all things of the world, compared with the eternal - those things which endure despite all, a sentiment that often appears in his poetry...</font></cite></h3></center>
<br><br>
Albert was born at Utrecht in the Netherlands in 1912, and obtained a Ph.D in history at the University. During the war he suffered greatly under the Nazi occupation, suffering near-starvation and witnessing horrors that were to have a profound effect on his later life and outlook. He was very sure of what he believed, yet it was more an inner sense than a great sprouting of words. Following the war, he took a degree in philosophy and trained to become a minister, afterwards working for lowly pay in small parishes.
<br><br>
<br>
<center><h3><cite><font color="blue">Reading the living will and seeing his handwriting was like him talking to me...</font></cite></h3></center>
<br><br>
Later he became a Quaker and author, often inscribing his thoughts on toilet paper as he worked as an orderly in a mental hospital. His published works include much poetry and a book on the Dutch philosopher Spinoza, which he wrote in Esperanto. He met his second wife, Phyllis, whom he married in 1970, through his interest in Esperanto. Settling in Coatbridge, he became Secretary of the Glasgow Esperanto Society for 20 years, and published a journal, Esperanto in Scotland, which was circulated internationally. He became a life member of VESS in 1984.
<br><br>
In February 1995, Albert suffered a stroke and his health gradually declined. His sight became too poor to study seriously, he could no longer enjoy hill walking or gardening, attend musical concerts or visit his family (five children, 11 grandchildren, two great-grandchildren and three step-children). As his quality of life disappeared, he was sustained by a deep belief in the emptiness of all things of the world, compared with the eternal - those things which endure despite all, a sentiment that often appears in his poetry and shared by his wife Phyllis, also a Quaker. Phyllis has distributed more than 8,000 living wills in the last eight years. Their motto was "Enjoy life, die in peace." Yet, when Albert was hospitalised and in severe pain from a twisted colon, the piece of paper alone was not enough to see that his wishes were respected.
<br><br>
Again and again, the doctors remonstrated with Phyllis to allow them to perfom surgery, saying that if they weren't successful they would just "stitch him up again." She had to be quite forceful with them before they finally agreed to respect his living will, which he had updated only six days earlier. "Reading the living will and seeing his handwriting was like him talking to me." The document was on the front of Albert's notes at Monklands Hospital in Lanarkshire. It was the key that provided convincing evidence of his wishes. All Phyllis had to do was to communicate it effectively, but it took a lot of perseverance before the doctors finally listened to her. When she repeated that Albert was not to have the proposed operation, in front of witnesses, the doctors finally felt they had no choice, and allowed Albert to die in peace.

Notes: In the UK, a relative has no legal authority to make treatment decisions for an incompetent adult, but it is not uncommon for hospitals to act as if this was not the case. A validly executed living will has legal force if it applies exactly to the circumstances, but often medical scenarios are not sufficiently clear cut. The whole effectiveness of the living will, in practice, relies on communication, not on laws or on the piece of paper itself. Close communication between the doctor and patient, while competent, with the strong active support of relatives when the patient becomes incompetent, are the most reliable options. A living will or values history is a valuable, perhaps even critical, part of this communication process. - Ed</cite>

<h3><BR>Interview with Clare Penny</h3>
</CENTER>
<HR>

<br><br>
In many countries - New Zealand, Australia, Canada - AIDS support organisations work hand in hand with right to die societies (who, in turn, have learnt not to be HIV-phobic!). Not so in Britain. The needs and demands of people living with the HIV virus include trying to choose the time of one's own death. Conservative to the core, such needs are ignored by the politically correct organisations set up with government money to "help" people with AIDS.
<br><br><br>
<center><h3><cite><font color="blue">There is this myth that people don't die in pain...</font></cite></h3></center>
<br><br>
So it came as a pleasant surprise when a reporter from Positive Times rang the VESS Office. Unlike many mainstream groups, the people behind Positive Times get no government funding: the only source of income is from advertising in the paper itself. Clare Penny, the editor, spoke not of patients she had known but of friends. Her involvement is grass-roots; her commitment is tangible. She can be in her office from ten in the morning till the following midnight. She believes in getting results that make a difference, and the paper is notable for its head-on approach to tackling difficult issues with candour and a zest for living.
<br><br>
"There is this myth that people don't die in pain. My stepmother died of cancer - very painfully. I was close to her and nursed her through, but it made a deep impression on me. But with AIDS there is more capacity to die in pain - there are so many diseases that a person with AIDS might succumb to. I've seen a person where the bones were actually pushing through the skin."
<br><br>
Positive Times ran a general article on euthanasia and followed it swiftly in the next issue with a second one, Dying to Live, which focussed more acutely on suicide and the work of VESS. It featured a picture from the Pepsi advert and a caption: Life to the max: a right which should not be exclusive to Pepsi-drinkers and skydivers.
<br><br>
The article explained that the option of suicide can serve as a safety net to those living with the virus, that planning your exit had more to do with living than with dying.
<br><br>
"I know several people who have attempted suicide with paracetamol," said Clare. "One friend took 60 and survived." Paracetamol is not only very unreliable, but often causes terrible internal damage. Clare was full of praise for the work of VESS with Departing Drugs. "There is a great reassurance in knowing how to commit suicide. Often, of course, when the time comes, the person is physically incapable, and so friends make suicide pacts. They talk in the pub about assisting suicides, but they worry over the legalities."
<br><br>
Without a change in the law, everything has to be very secret. No safeguards, dignity lessened, and the danger of failure through inadequate knowledge and backup and/or prosecution if caught. "The law failed Dr Cox big time. People like that shouldn't be prosecuted!"
<br><br>
Many "voluntary" organisations are plagued by power struggles for key positions. Not so Positive Times and its companion The Pink Paper. Clare is about to step down as Editor and carry on as a medical science / health correspondent.
<br><br><br>
<center><h3><cite><font color="blue">Some people find that planning their suicide as a contingency plan can actually be a very life-enhancing experience, even if most people who consider it don't actually carry it out.</font></cite></h3></center>
<br><br>
Why? "Because I feel strongly that the editor should be an HIV positive man - after all, that's what Positive Times is about." Nice one, Clare! We salute your integrity. Hopefully AIDS/HIV support groups and right-to-die societies will learn how to learn from each other more as the campaign continues. The testimony of a man suffering from AIDS was instrumental in the recent Ninth Circuit decision (see cover story), and in Australia, where the first ever law on euthanasia seems set to come into force this year, AIDS support groups lobbied parliament and referred members to VESS to obtain drugs information.
<br><br>
Some people find that planning their suicide as a contingency plan can actually be a very life-enhancing experience, even if most people who consider it don't actually carry it out. In the words of Positive Times: "Somebody once said that the thought of committing suicide had helped them through many a bad night. For most people with HIV or AIDS considering it, it will remain just that - a thought. Planning a suicide may have a lot more to do with living than with dying."

<BR><BR>
"Euthanasia means a good and easy death" - how many times do we here this recited like some mantra meant to convince our opponents? Okay, so that would be the translation if we followed the Greek roots of the word but it is not what the word means today in general usage. People generally think of one of two things when we say euthanasia: the active termination of life at the patient's request as it occurs in the Netherlands (or similar proposals in other countries); or the Nazi extermination program of murder. Some people take an extreme view, while many fall somewhere between the two camps. Dictionary definitions avail us little, as there will always be large groups of people that claim it means something else. (We see the unfortunate tendency to use dictionaries to define words rather than attempting to arrive at an understanding of what we truly mean.) The apparent derivation (from the Greek, eu - thanatos) hardly describes what we mean. Even extending the definition to include "bringing about of this, especially in the case of incurable and painful disease" hardly covers it - hospices often succeed in bringing about a peaceful death, but they don't perform euthanasia!
<BR><BR>
Proponents often go on to stress the importance of the word "voluntary" and we end up with a sort of mini mission statement without getting any closer to defining what we mean. In fact, our "definition" is so poor that, rather than helping our cause, it provides easy meat for opponents. We complain that words like "killing" and "murder" are emotive, and then commit the same error. Emotive buzzwords will mean different things to different people and are often a stumbling block to civilised discourse.
<BR><BR>
At a recent gathering of "pro-life" and "pro-choice" people of widely differing views (but sincerely committed to exploring them) we looked first at what terminology we could use to communicate. Case examples were useful for discussion, but phrases such as those used in the Netherlands proved the least troublesome, such as "Decisions that result in the ending of life with/without the request of the patient." Voluntary cannot be objectively determined, and opponents will always be concerned over whether the "request" was truly voluntary. The request itself, however, can be objectively observed as an event. It either existed or it didn't, and safeguards such as avoiding undue influence are ancilliary. A "decision that results in the ending of life" avoids needless divisions, for instance, over whether double-effect was involved. It avoids the moral opprobrium that some people connect with the "e" word. They are important decisions even when no request was involved, such as in the case of Tony Bland. A slightly broader heading might be "treatment decisions at the end of life."
<BR><BR>
<h3>Conceptual terms vs popular language</h3>

If the above holds true, then why retain such words in the name of the Society? There are many reasons. Changing the name would involve a lack of continuity, but there are also deeper reasons that have a sound historical, social reform basis. The history of reform shows the need for strong campaigning alongside clear reasoning. In analysing a situation we need clear conceptual arguments, but in conducting a campaign we need words that generate feeling and with which broad sections of the public can identify. Headlines are not made up of long sentences with words of many syllables - accuracy is sacrificed for attention-grab. We should be aware of the difference, and the different uses. Similarly, in part perhaps because of its very vagueness, voluntary euthanasia provides a focal point for all interest in that subject - from the public, the media, researchers - they all know to come to us. The same point applies to the word "living will" - vague, but the most popular term in the public's eye (we leave it to serious analysis to consider whether we mean, by that, an advance directive, an advance statement, an advance declaration, all of which have different shades of meaning.)
<BR><BR>
<h3>The language of rights</h3>

A similar and very serious problem occurs with the language of rights. Talk of "rights" produces a rapid public response, polarisation of feeling, public debate, an airing of the basic issues. The division is perhaps more problematic, as the use of the word "right" in the phrase "right-to-die" is, generally speaking, an abuse of the terminology. The ethicists and the courts will usually examine the issue in terms of an "interest" in dying. So when should we shout about "rights" and when should we be less confrontational in our choice of language? Sometimes, cultural differences may be important factors. The Australian euthanasia law is called "The Rights of the Terminally Ill Act" - and is in the Northern Territory where the issue of rights is a politically important subject in an area where there is a large Aboribinal population. The USA, with its written constitution, can analyse rights in terms of that constitution. Elsewhere, the logical flaws in the use of such language are more apparent and may serve to perpetuate conflict with "pro-life" groups. It is a difficult balancing act, and can only be accomplished if protagonists understand the difference rather than believing that the "buzz-words" are the language of serious discourse. There's no need to shoot the piano player - simply to realise that the rendering is hardly a symphony.

<P><I><TT>The law on negligence plays a great part in governing how patients'
refusals of treatment are handled. Chris Docker suggests it is need of
overhaul... (Note: this article has been slightly shortened from its original
formats. Comments are welcomed to the author at vess@euthanasia.org.)</TT></I></P>

<P><B>Introduction</B></P>

<P>What I shall attempt to argue in this paper is that negligence has developed
an overloaded framework that disguises bad law, and I will suggest that,
if the evolution of the common law fails to mutate the tort of negligence
to accommodate changing needs within modern society, then statutory adjustment
may be desirable. Would that statutory embodiment should prove unnecessary
but, unless the necessary reform can be achieved within the current system,
some such shake up may be necessary.</P>

<P>Antiquated law[1] is attempting to deal with the technology explosion
of the last fifty years and the attendant need for information and ethical
awareness. Non-medical problems, that are more a question of ethics or
resources, are being treated as if they were medical. The tests which the
law attempts to apply (e.g. &quot;Bolam&quot;[2], best interests[3]) are
controversial and in need of overhaul. I will argue that one of the best
ways to tackle an accessible part of this problem would be to separate
out ethical from purely medical concerns.</P>

<P>Medical negligence occasions vast expenditure from the public purse,
yet there is low confidence that it attains the degree of justice that
it should.[4] It is estimated that the sorely pressed NHS[5] spent upward
of &pound;45m on medical negligence claims in 1990.[6] There is no doubt
that most of these claims were time-consuming, expensive and potentially
destructive, many of them bettering neither patient or doctor.[7] The figure
had risen to &pound;150m by 1995[8] and looks set for further increase.[9]
These costs are a considerable drain on healthcare and, even though there
is still much debate over whether costs can be sensibly reduced, it is
important that we also look at how those costs are distributed and whether
such distribution can be achieved more fairly. Negligence does not simply
cover applying medical technique badly, it includes failing to give appropriate
information to a patient before obtaining consent,[10] and it is to this
latter category[11] that I particularly wish to turn.[12] It is different
from medical diagnosis and treatment inasmuch as it a more distinctly ethical,
rather than medical, issue. With increasing technology[13], it is an area
that will assume increased importance, not less, as we approach the next
century. There may be little reason to suggest that a patient should not
benefit from more appropriate expertise in these matters, simply because
it is not readily available under the present system.</P>

<P>There have, of course been many proposals and attempts to overhauling
the whole of the tort of medical negligence,[14] adopting a &quot;no-fault&quot;
system, or implementing many less drastic changes across the board, such
us with the very recent paper of Lord Woolf.[15] Unfortunately, although
a tort of negligence may be an imperfect means of compensating for wrong,[16]
other options may be even less desirable,[17] and some of the supposed
advantages of alternate systems have not been borne out by practice.[18]
The debate is clouded by popular beliefs: although some claims are undoubtedly
ill-advised[19] and patients are becoming more inclined to go to court,
there is evidence, for instance, that too few, rather than too many, claims
result in a successful action.[20] What needs to be done is to separate
out the groups of wrongs currently handled as negligence and build more
appropriate procedures and standards to assess them. Recent steps to promote
mediation,[21] for instance, or augment the powers of the General Medical
Council,[22] or modifying judicial procedures,[23] tackle specific aspects
in relative isolation and can be thought of as improvements to the present
system[24] that may reap lesser or greater rewards (and may themselves
also need further refinement). These smaller, specific measures have the
great advantage of being implementable rather than major, sweeping alterations,
that not only might fail from using too large a brush but from the lack
of parliamentary time needed for proper debate of such extensive bills.[25]</P>

<P>It is one thing to acknowledge that doctors may lack ethical expertise,
even if they are, with beneficent intentions, often capable of disguising
moral decisions as clinical judgements; (this need not infer moral culpability
on the doctor: someone whose training is overwhelmingly concerned with
the diagnosis and treatment of organic illness cannot easily acquire or
display the conceptual and interpersonal skills that a truly informed consent[26]
demands.[27]) it is then quite another thing to demand that they suddenly
acquire that expertise,[28] and perhaps not even entirely reasonable: we
encourage nurses to acquire proficiency in many areas of medicine for instance,
but we don't expect them to double up as doctors. There are times when
a doctor will practice better medicine from an awareness of medical ethics,
but that does not make her an ethicist - in fact there might even be a
conflict of interests between the two roles. I am thinking of a nurse or
ethicist particularly as a patient advocate[29], concentrating on patient
values that may seem at odds with priorities of diagnosis, treatment and
resource allocation. Of course, often the courts will encompass this role,
but it could be argued that this could, in some instances, merely be exchanging
medical paternalism for legal paternalism.</P>

<P>As these areas are non-medical ones, strictly speaking, we might argue
that in some instances, such as information-giving and withdrawal of treatment
decisions, the tort of negligence should be patient-centred rather than
medical team -centred.</P>

<P>It is perhaps the point made by Lord Mustill when he ventured:</P>

<H5>...I venture to feel some reservations about the application of the
principle of civil liability in negligence laid down in Bolam v. Friern
Hospital Management Committee... I accept without difficulty that this
principle applies to the ascertainment of the medical raw material such
as diagnosis, prognosis and appraisal of the patient's cognitive functions.[30]
Beyond this point, however, it may be said that the decision is ethical,
not medical, and that there is no reason in logic why on such a decision
the opinions of doctors should be decisive.[31]</H5>

<P>Yet the British courts have long retained the emphasis on doctors' duty
in questions of information disclosure, as Professor McLean pointed out
in her seminal work on the subject,[32] and they have done so possibly
at the expense of emphasising what Lord Scarman in <I>Sidaway[33] </I>called
&quot;a basic human right&quot; relating to the right to make one's own
decisions - and the fact that &quot;the doctor's duty arises from his patient's
rights&quot; not vice versa. The courts' protection of human rights is
more basic and far-reaching than the handling of medical scenarios and
so its significance is not to be underestimated.[34]</P>

<P>A danger of medicalisation of the law becomes apparent, for instance,
in the inconsistencies of judgements such as that of Lord Browne-Wilkinson,
who, whilst advocating a prudent patient position in <I>Sidaway[35] </I>makes
the error of calling information &quot;advice&quot; when he lumps together
&quot;diagnosis, advice and treatment.&quot;[36] The typical bias is thus
introduced: doctors presenting information in the way that they would persuade
the patient. This further tips the scales in what is already an uneven
balance; as Freidson observed:</P>

<H5>It is my impression that clients are more often bullied than informed
into consent, their resistance weakened in part by their desire for the
general service if not the specific procedure, in part by the oppressive
setting they find themselves in, and in part by the calculated intimidation,
restriction of information, and covert threats of rejection by the professional
staff itself.[39]</H5>

<P>Bias, if any,[40] should actually, be that of the patient. Some attempts
to enhance this have met with little success against a backdrop of medical
paternalism or bureaucratic lethargy. Much is talked about informed consent,
but it remains, in practice, little more than a quasi-ethical platitude.[41]
Not only is informed consent a concept that has no formal standing in British
law,[42] but consent is frequently obtained, quite legally, without the
disclosure of information that is ethically required for such consent to
be valid. Lord Donaldson, in his historic judgement in <I>Re T, </I>suggested
that forms[43] used for patient refusal and consent could enhance patient
awareness[44] of possible consequences by &quot;different and larger typeface,
by underlining, the employment of colour print or otherwise.[45] Yet the
Department of Health came up with little improvement other than window
dressing and &quot;added verbiage&quot;.[46] In a more constructive vein,
the Law Society in conjunction with the BMA more recently came up with
arguments about 'enhancing capacity': &quot;Doctors should be aware both
that medical disabilities can fluctuate and that there are many factors
extraneous to a person's medical disorder which may adversely influence
capacity. It is the duty of the assessing doctor to maximise capacity&quot;[47]
They suggest that capacity can be enhanced as much as possible by treating
secondary symptoms, by carefully considering the time and place for vital
communication, third party considerations, and a suitable time scale and
supportive framework for digesting the information before a decision is
required.[48] Competence to consent is as important as the information
on which to make a decision about consent or refusal. Some of these simple,
very human approaches[49] can be seen in the better pre-natal clinics,
particularly for pregnant women contemplating the possibility of a child
with Downs syndrome; but even in this area facilities vary widely across
the country and are sometimes non-existent.[50]</P>

<P>The notion of informed consent probably grew out of the concern for
research subjects and a perceived need to minimize the potential for harm,[51]
but as it became reinforced with the growth of, and demand for, patients'
&quot;rights&quot;,[52] it may have taken on a mantle which it can ill-support.</P>

<H5>Without much exaggeration it can be said that all of medical ethics
is but a footnote to informed consent. It is the concept that first called
medicine out of its paternalistic slumber and into the open light of public
scrutiny. Informed consent serves as the foundation upon which answers
to new questions and problems are constructed. Informed consent is a kind
of doctrine, that is, an amalgam of legal and philosophical reasoning with
a conceptual framework and a number of specific prescriptions. This framework
entails a few basic actions and presupposes certain conditions. At the
heart of the doctrine is the legal principle that &quot;the right of a
competent person to refuse medical treatment is virtually absolute.&quot;
The exercise of this right presupposes that the patient must receive all
information relevant to the decision to undergo or forgo a proposed treatment
and that he or she must comprehend the information. The legal principle
indicates that the patient needs to be competent and it is relatively freely
made. Although influence is acceptable, all forms of coercion are beyond
the pale.[53]</H5>

<P>We can go on to look at the limitations of the doctrine with a view
to refining it, but that process cannot effectively start until we address
the basic anomaly of the law in Bolam, that makes one person (the patient)
the apparent decisionmaker, and another person (the doctor acting in accordance
with an accepted body of medical opinion) the ultimate arbiter of that
very information needed to make the decision.[54] In other words, developmental
progress for patient advocacy, or reconceiving the contextual basis of
autonomy (as examined by Hardwig[55] and Kuczewski[56] and others) will
be wasted effort until the fundamental loophole is corrected. One cannot
improve on, or enhance patient autonomy, if the very basis for that autonomy
is effectively denied by simplistic application of common law.</P>

<P>There has been some hope that the common law would gradually come to
refine its use of the Bolam test, using it, quite reasonably it might be
argued, as a benchmark for assessing negligence in matters of medical technique,
and avoiding it for cases of information disclosure. Sadly the practice
has been dilatory to say the least.</P>

<P><I>Bolam </I>was cited, for instance to justify an action against a
surgeon who failed to warn a patient that an operation to treat rectal
prolapse might mean that the 28 year old man would be unable to have sexual
intercourse. The fact that the case was won for the plaintiff, arguably
by such misappropriated case law, did little to establish patients' rights
on a more secure footing.[57]</P>

<P>One might suggest that emphasis on rights rather than duties is hair-splitting,
but the practical implementation demonstrates a more marked difference.
In many cases, effective assertion of patients' rights requires advocacy
- someone to be there in the patient's corner. Many patients entering hospital
will seem to be &quot;capable&quot;, but the reality is that their effective
assertiveness may be limited by disease or injury and the attendant stress
and worry, not to mention the business-like atmosphere encouraging him
to &quot;do as he's told&quot; as he lies helpless in a hospital bed. Psychologically,
the dice are weighted against the patient. It seems no small coincidence
that in the currently popular vogue for &quot;living wills&quot; or &quot;advance
medical directives&quot; the only well known instances where these documents
have been or would have been followed are where there was a patient advocate
- either in the form of a determined relative[58 ]or in the form of the
courts.[59]</P>

<P>It would be too easy to say that the role of patient advocate should
be taken on more formally by nurses. Although there is a place for this,
greater formalisation could lead to greater conflict between nursing and
medical professions, possibly within the same healthcare team.[61] Ad hoc
arrangements might work - we are generally looking at the careful application
of basic human qualities of communication that may be overlooked or overstretched
in a professional setting. But the importance of informed consent is so
great that more secure provision should perhaps be made. A statutory duty
on health care facilities to provide a surrogate patient advocate[62] where
none was available would better serve this end. The level of skill required
should be commensurate with the dilemmas likely to be faced, but there
might be an increased role for a hospital ethicist, perhaps even with professional
liability.[63] Such a system, particularly in the current arrangement of
NHS trusts, might also go some way to standardising negligence claims,
reducing costs both by easing the identification of liability and by reducing
the incidence of information-disclosure negligence. NHS Trusts might make
savings on the latter count, but even if ease of access to litigation resulted
in the savings being absorbed, a more equitable system would have at least
seen national resources better spent.</P>

<P>The basics of negligence should be retained - duty of care - breach
of that duty - resultant damage. Merely the reliance on the Bolam test
should be changed. So, in <I>Goorkani v. Tayside Health Board (O.H.) [1991]
SLT 94, </I>the result would probably be the same, as it seems Mr Goorkani
would have chosen the same treatment, even if he had been informed about
the risk of infertility, in order to preserve his eyesight. However, in
<I>Gold v. Haringey Health Authority [1987] 2 All ER,64 </I>the result
would probably have been the opposite, as the appeal court, relying heavily
on <I>Bolam, </I>overturned the lower court's decision to award damages
in negligence to a woman who had undergone a sterilisation to avoid further
pregnancy, without sufficient warning from the physician of the failure
rate of the operation, and without being given information about the alternative
of a vasectomy for her husband. In allowing the appeal, Brown LJ also drew
selectively on Sidaway, agreeing with Lord Dipcock's rather simplistic
view that the general duty of a doctor is &quot;not subject to dissection
into a number of component parts to which different criteria of what satisfy
the duty of care apply.&quot; This decision is cognate with similar reasonings
in <I>Blyth v. Bloomsbury Health Authority [1993] 4 Med LR 151 (CA) </I>and,
in Scotland, in <I>Moyes v Lothian Health Board [1990] SLT 444 1 Med LR
463.</I></P>

<P>The legal change should be supported by social and other measures to
enhance capacity and increase patient advocacy. Social changes that are
not supported by a fundamental shift in the law relating to standards of
information giving could result in forms, promises and guidelines that
are not worth the paper they are written on. As West expressed it:</P>

<P>The entire process will be for naught if all we accomplish is to change
the old saw from &quot;The operation was a success, but the patient died,&quot;
to &quot;The patient died, but his physician stayed within the practice
guideline.&quot;65</P>

<P><B>Summary</B></P>

<P>If there is not a reversal of common law trends to follow the Bolam
principle in deciding claims for medical negligence where information disclosure
is at issue, then statutory or declaratory guidance should be devised.
When patient autonomy has been thus enabled by adequate information, it

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>1.&quot;Negligence derives from trespass by way of the
action of the case, and like all derivatives of case, it is actionable
only on proof of damage, i.e. not per se. However, the modern tort of negligence,
arising from breach by the defendant of a legal duty of care owed by him
to the plaintiff, takes its origin from the early nineteenth century. Since
then it has developed in &quot;disconnected slabs&quot; - Candler v Crane
Christmas &amp; Co (1951) - so that even today it exhibits little generality.&quot;

&quot;It has also been said that negligence 'properly connotes the complex
concept of duty, breach and damage thereby suffered by the person to whom
the duty was owing': Lochgelly Iron Works &amp; Coal Co. v. M'Mullan (1934),
per Lord Wright. This is the modern definition.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>2.The so-called &quot;Bolam&quot; test, based on the case
of Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee [1957] 1 WLR 582, indicates
that a doctor is not negligent if he or she acts in accordance with a school
of thought accepted at the time as reasonable by a responsible body of
medical opinion, even though other doctors adopt a different practice.
This has been the subject of common law debates in many jurisdictions (some
of which have rejected it altogether) and also within the UK, for instance,
when the judges in Sidaway v. Governers of the Bethlem Royal Hospital and
Maudsley Hospital and Others [1985] 1 All ER 643 (HL) had considerable
differences of opinion on it. A detailed discussion occurs in McLean S.,
A Patient's Right to Know - Information Disclosure, the Doctor and the
Law. Hants: Dartmouth 1989:104-122. Classic alternative doctrine to the
Bolam test is presented in the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals
case of Canterbury v. Spence 464 F 2d 772 (DC, 1972); and the Canadian
case of Haughian v Paine [1987] 37 DLR (4th) 624 (Sask CA), for instance,
illustrates that the doctor's duty should extend not only to disclosing
all relevant risks but also, in principle, to alternative forms of treatment.</FONT></P>

seen in Veatch: &quot;For a clinician to guess at what is the best course
for the patient, three assumptions must be true regarding a theory of the
good. First, the clinician must be expected to determine what will best
serve the patient's medical or health interest; second, the clinician must
be expected to determine how to trade off health interests with other interests;
and third, the clinician must be expected to determine how the patient
should relate the pursuit of her best interest to other moral goals and
responsibilities, including serving the interests of others and fulfilling
any moral duties she may have that happen to conflict with her interest.&quot;

litigation should be as level as possible,' he says. 'There are often cases,
medical negligence for example, where the plaintiff cannot afford a trial
involving multiple expert witnesses duplicating the same work. In that
sort of situation, the procedural judge would have a very significant decision
to make. He would have to decide whether the plaintiff is right and the
case could produce a reasonably just result in the way he proposes. The
alternative would be to do it in a much more elaborate way. The judge will
say to the defendant who has much more substantial means, &quot;If you
want to do it in that more elaborate way, you've got to pay (even if you
win) the difference between doing it on an affordable basis and doing it
on an unnaffordable basis.&quot;'&quot; - Ward S., &quot;Let the legal

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>28.This is not to say that medical ethics is not being
increasingly taught. &quot;We wish, however, to correct the impression
given by Mary Kearns that doctors who pass through Edinburgh University
Medical School have not studied medical ethics. ... In the pre-clinical
years, students are introduced to the principles underlying medical ethics
and these are related to issues of confidentiality and informed consent.
The application of medical ethics then features formally as part of at
least four clinical attachments, and involves particular consideration
of issues surrounding dying and euthanasia, human genetics, fertility,
abortion and decision-making.&quot; - Boyd K., Thomson D., Porter M., Watson
G., Fleming S., &quot;Medical ethics&quot; The Scotsman (letters) 25 May
1996. Yet in the history of medicine there can be observed, for instance,
a bias against truth-telling both in the disclosure of information and
in admitting fault, and that this is inconsistent with public morality
and that of other professions is apparent. Solicitors, for instance, are
&quot;obliged by the rules of professional conduct to inform a client if
they have acted negligently or improperly in the performance of their work.
This is not incumbent on ... the surgeon or physician who tends you in
ill health...&quot; - Napley D., &quot;The ethics of the professions&quot;
Law Society Gazette 1985;82:818-825, quoted in Gillon R., Philosophical
Medical Ethics, Chichester: John Wiley &amp; Sons 1995;pp.168-169. Sometimes
the law does not seem overly tolerant at this lack: &quot;How much and
what sort of information should be given to the patient? Where there has
been a mishap the patient must be told. Where in giving treatment by injection
a needle was broken, without negligence, and left in the patient's body,
it was held to be negligent not to tell the patient of the presence of
the broken needle (Gerber v Pines, 1933, 79 S.J.13...)&quot; - Carrier
J., Kendall I., Medical Negligence: Complaints and Compensation, Gower

has generally been absent from medical codes even from the time of Hippocrates.

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>29.&quot;Suppose a nurse ... discovers that a patient
has been prescribed twice the normal dose of a drug. Although he is dubious
he gives it anyway, claiming that his only responsibility is to administer
drugs as prescribed by the doctor. If the dose is incorrect, this nurse
considers that it is the doctor's fault and not his. this stance conflicts
with the idea of a nurse as an autonomous practitioner and patient advocate.
The UKCC encourages nurses to act as advocates for patients and defines
advocacy as being 'concerned with promoting the well-being and interests
of patients and clients'. ... The nurse remains morally and legally accountable
for his own actions and if he fails to clarify the situation, then it must
be assumed that he has good reasons for giving the drug or has chosen to
disregard the fact that he is accountable. He will have difficulty justifying

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>36.It has been observed that Dunn LJ, in Sidaway, seemed
not unreasonably led astray by this. &quot;Thus, Dunn LJ's conclusion,
that the standards of the medical profession are to be applied, begs the
question by assuming that information giving is the same as advice giving.
This mis-analysis is clear when Dunn LJ goes on to argue that 'in giving
advice the professional man will normally refer to the advantages and disadvantages
of the course which he recommends.' But this is precisely to misstate what
patient self-determination is all about. Advantages and disadvantages are
evaluations which only patients can make. What doctors must give is information
about alternatives and consequences, including risks, thereby enabling
the patient to judge for him- or herself.&quot; Kennedy I. op. cit., supra,

to influence patient choices - even while preserving the appearance of
obtaining informed consent. The Latinate obscurity of medical diagnosis
and the overwhelming nature of too much medical information often contribute
to this possibility. Thus, many physicians claim they can get patients
to agree to nearly anything they propose; it is simply a matter of how
the choice is framed.&quot; Battin M., op. cit., supra, p.169.</FONT></P>

to respect someone's &quot;autonomy&quot; other than that of the doctor
infringing the autonomy of someone else, as for instance, in the controversial
case of Re S (adult refusal of treatment) [1992] 4 All ER 671, (1992) 9

on how such information is to be shared. Some practical suggestions are
made in McNulty C., &quot;Mentally Incapacitated Adults and Decision-making:
a psychological perspective&quot; Medicine, Science &amp; the Law 1995;35(2):159-164,
viz: &quot;The phrases 'simple language' and 'broad terms' are ambiguous.
To be of assistance, these phrases need to be operationalized in a way
that leaves no room for uncertainty.&quot; (p.161), and: &quot;Other practical
techniques for assisting a person to engage in decision-making include
the presentation of information in non-verbal formats: for example, Carson
(1993) suggests breaking information down into discrete units and perhaps
employing flow charts and diagrams.&quot;(p.162).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>43. Consent forms are only one means of obtaining consent,
but have their place if designed with consideration of the ethical dynamics
involved. They cannot, of themselves, be a substitute for interactive giving
of information, no matter how much information is contained on them. A
consent form does not take into account what facts might be most important
to that particular patient. Neither does it explain facts in the way that
that patient might have reasonably have desired. &quot;Truthfulness is
not the bald communication of facts: it is the kind of sensitivity to individual
need which knows that there is a time to speak and a time to remain silent.&quot;

<P>The word euthanasia, from ancient Greek, means 'good death'. Today,
the advocates of euthanasia, who speak of death with dignity, also mean
a good death. And of c</P>

<P>ourse we all want a good death or a death with dignity. Yet, different
people would seem to mean very different things when they speak of a good
death or of a death with dignity.</P>

<P>If I propose legislation to give old people, or severely ill people,
approaching the end of their earthly journey, the right to a good death
or a death with dignity, most people would probably not object. But if
I suggest that old people or severely ill people who are approaching their
end should be killed, then my suggestion would probably meet with less
approval. The word 'kill' has a negative and threatening ring. What this
shows is how important it is to be clear about how we use different terms,
especially when we discuss serious matters such as euthanasia.</P>

<P>By euthanasia one might mean the intentional killing by a doctor of
a patient by an act or omission. However, this was not the definition offered
by the Walton Committee, the House of Lords' Select Committee on Medical
Ethics, which was set up in 1993 after the famous Tony Bland case. When
the Committee reported in February 1994, it described euthanasia as a 'deliberate
intervention' rather than as a 'deliberate omission intended to terminate
life'. This is noteworthy, for it is also possible for a doctor or a nurse
to intentionally kill a patient in his or her care by means of an omission,
such as a deliberate failure to give insulin to a diabetic patient.</P>

<P>I shall discuss omissions later, but first let us talk about euthanasia
in the sense of active euthanasia, that is giving a drug such as potassium
chloride to end a patient's life. Now, the Voluntary Euthanasia Society
and the World Federation of Right to Die Societies are asking for active
euthanasia and assisted suicide by patient request. But they are careful
to point out that they do not wish to introduce anything like the Nazi
euthanasia programme. That is to say, they insist that they do not wish
to see non-voluntary euthanasia introduced; they do not wish to see patients
being 'helped to die' unless they have asked for it. However, they argue
that autonomous moral agents should be free to make end-of life decisions
for themselves, including euthanasia. Patient autonomy and patient self-determination
is what they are asking for. And one reason why they think it is so important
for people today to be able to choose to have help to die is that they
fear over-interventionist medicine and a prolonged death attached to tubes
and gadgets. They fear pain and they fear being reduced to a state of utter
dependence. And, of course, we can all sympathise with this fear. But at
the same time, it is important to consider carefully whether the reasons
the advocates of euthanasia give for legalising voluntary euthanasia really
are good reasons.</P>

<P>First, as concerns the fear of pain, with modern pain-relief and palliative
care, it would seem that most - though not all - pain can be successfully
relieved. Secondly, as regards the fear of dependence, even if nobody wants
to be dependent on others for the most intimate of tasks, and even if many
of us might consider such a situation undignified, is it not true that
each one of us, every human being, possesses an inherent dignity which
can never be taken away however undignified his or her situation is? We
must distinguish between undignified human beings and undignified or embarrassing
circumstances. A person does not become undignified because his or her
circumstances are. To take an extreme example, it is very undignified to
be raped, but the rape victim does not therefore lose her human dignity.</P>

<P>We must also ask ourselves the question: What are the risks attached
to introducing voluntary euthanasia? One of the dangers in introducing
voluntary euthanasia lies in the fact that in some situations it might
be hard to distinguish between voluntary and non-voluntary euthanasia.
The elderly or disabled may come under pressure from society or from their
own relatives to ask for 'help to die'. They may be made to feel that they
ought to die because they are a burden. And so they may ask for 'help to
die'. But should a request made under such pressure be considered voluntary?</P>

<P>And this is not the only problem; voluntary euthanasia may lead to what
is without a doubt nonvoluntary euthanasia. The advocates for euthanasia
say that there is no reason why this should happen. But there is. No doctor
would grant a patient's request for euthanasia, unless he or she believed
that the patient's life was of poor quality and not worth living. For if
the doctor helps a cancer patient who asks for it to die because he thinks
the patient's quality of life is so poor that he would be better off dead,
would it not then also be reasonable for the doctor to help another cancer
patient in a similar state to die, even if that patient has not asked for
it? If the doctor feels that he is acting out of mercy in the case of the
patient who asks for euthanasia, why should he not also wish to be merciful
to the other patient who has not asked for it?</P>

<P>You can see the problem. If you allow mercy killing on request, it may
seem cruel not to allow mercy killing which has not been requested. And
yet would it not be rather dangerous if doctors and nurses were allowed
to kill patients because they felt pity for them? In other words, it would
surely be wrong to allow some members of society, say doctors, to kill
other members of society, say patients, out of pity or because they thought
some patients had lives not worth living. Surely, if we allowed this to
happen, we would end up with a situation not unlike Nazi Germany. And,
do you not think that many people would stop using the health services
or refuse going to hospital, if doctors were allowed to end the lives of
patients whose lives they considered to be of a poor quality? Is it not
true that, if we allowed doctors to kill, doctors might no longer be trusted?</P>

<P>The fact that voluntary euthanasia seems to lead to non-voluntary euthanasia
becomes even clearer if one looks at the situation in the Netherlands,
where the law for a number of years has allowed voluntary euthanasia, even
if strictly speaking the practice is not legal. That is to say, provided
certain conditions are fulfilled, a Dutch doctor who performs euthanasia
will not be prosecuted and penalised. One requirement, at least until recently,
was that the patient must be terminally ill and dying. Another requirement
- at least until recently - has been the free, explicit and repeated request
the patient.</P>

<P>But let us look at the famous Remmelink Report, published in September
1990. This report on end-of-life decisions in the Netherlands, defined
euthanasia as an active intervention to terminate another person's life,
performed upon the latter's request. However, as the Report showed, the
lives of thousands of patients were actively ended without their request.
Should we be surprised? No, for, as I explained, once you introduce voluntary
mercy killing, it will seem natural to administer mercy killing even if
patients have not asked for it.</P>

<P>Of course, doctors should do what they can to alleviate suffering. And
it is a well-known and widely accepted practice to provide high doses of
pain-killers to, for example, cancer patients. In some cases, this may
apparently shorten the patient's life. But if this happened, would it be
euthanasia? The answer is that it depends upon the doctor's intention.
It depends on the intention with which the doctor gives or prescribes the
pain-killer. If the intention is simply to relieve pain and if no other
means exist, then it can be argued that it is not death but pain-relief
that is intended and that the death, if it follows, as to be regarded as
an unintended side-effect of giving pain relief.</P>

<P>Arguing against this distinction, advocates of euthanasia might say
that the doctor's intention could be mixed. However, to meet this objection,
it should be pointed out that there is a difference between providing adequate
pain-relief with drugs such as opiates which are analgesics, and giving
drugs such as potassium chloride which are not analgesics. If the doctor
gives analgesics, then this is an indication that his intention is not
to kill. If, on the other hand, he uses potassium chloride, it would be
obvious that his intention was to kill. In other words, it seems good sensible
practice to distinguish between pain-relieving and life-relieving drugs,
when discussing euthanasia.</P>

<P>To return to the Dutch law, which allows euthanasia with life-relieving
drugs, it is in fact becoming more and more elastic. Patients used to have
to be terminally ill, before being granted a request to receive 'help to
die'. But a couple of years ago a doctor was cleared of legal charges after
having helped a depressed, but not otherwise ill, woman to die. The woman
was a widow who had lost her two sons one after the other, and who felt
she no longer had anything to live for. Of course, we can all sympathise
with her plight. Yet we also know that people can live through grief and
come out of depression and again be grateful for living, despite their
past. A law which allows euthanasia on request in the case of depression
risks depriving lots of people of worthwhile futures.</P>

<P>To turn to withholding and withdrawing treatment, as opposed to active
provision of drugs to endlife. Let us start with 'living wills' or advance
directives as they are also called. Such directives concern non-treatment.
They state that under certain specified conditions, the patient does not
wish to be resuscitated, and wishes to forego treatment aimed at prolonging
or sustaining life. That is to say, they state that the patient declares
now, while of sound mind, that if he were to become mentally incapacitated
and unable to express his wishes, he would not wish to be resuscitated
or to receive life-sustaining treatment under such and such conditions.
Are such documents helpful and would it be a good idea to make them legally
binding?</P>

<P>It is partly because people might change their minds that many people
argue that such advance directives would not be a good idea. Earlier this
year the Government decided not to introduce the Law Commission's Bill
on Mental Incapacity, which would have made advance directives legally
binding. The decision went against the recommendations stated in the British
Medical Association's Code of Practice of April 1995, which suggested that
advance directives are legally binding according to common law. That is
to say, the BMA pointed out that patients of sixteen years or over and
of sound mind have a common law right to refuse treatment. And so they
argued that, if people refused certain future treatment options while of
sound mind, then their request should be respected when they were no longer
capable of making an informed decision about their treatment. However,
as the law stands today, it seems unclear whether advance directives are
legally binding.</P>

<P>Leaving the legal status of advance directives to the side, let us discuss
their advantages and disadvantages. Those who argue for advance directives
argue for patient autonomy and against medical paternalism. Moreover, it
is often pointed out that such documents might be helpful for doctors and
nurses when a mentally incapacitated patient is suffering from malignant
disease or AIDS or from an advanced degenerative disease of the nervous
system, or severe and lasting brain damage, or severe senile or pre-senile
dementia. If he or she has made an advance statement, it might make it
easier for the doctor to decide how to treat the patient.</P>

<P>Against these arguments, others point out that individuals who draw
up advance directives are not making informed decisions, because they cannot
know in advance precisely what situations they may face. Hence, they argue,
an advance directive could actually amount to a blank cheque for the doctor,
which would be contrary to what would have been intended by signing an
advance directive. That is, some people hold that advance statements could
protect doctors from legal suits and make it easier for them to decide
on non-treatment. In other words, there are those that argue that advance
directives would actually protect the doctor rather than the patient.</P>

<P>As I also said, people's attitudes may change. The thought of a lingering
death or a few months of slowly dying might seem futile to a healthy person.
And so many a healthy person might think it is a good idea to sign an advance
directive to the effect that in the case of a degenerative illness such
as senile dementia, he or she would not want to receive even, for example,
antibiotics. Yet, it is probably true to say that many people with such
conditions are quite happy to be living.</P>

<P>Another objection to advance directives is that the put the onus on
the patient to demand a certain type of care. But are doctors and nurses
not under a professional obligation to provide the most intelligent and
compassionate care they can give? And if so, surely doctors and nurses
ought to seek to avoid administering futile treatment or prolonging suffering
when there is no real hope of recovery.</P>

<P>However, this does of course raise the question of where to draw the
line between euthanasia by omission and other omissions, as well as the
question of whether tube-feeding should be regarded as medical treatment
or as basic nursing care which can never be withheld.</P>

<P>In the famous case of Tony Bland, who had been in a persistent vegetative
state for three years, the High Court and the Law Lords seemed to argue
that artificial nutrition and hydration is to be regarded as treatment
rather than as nursing care, and ruled that it was in the patient's bestinterests
that fluid and nutrition be withdrawn in order not to prolong his life.
The case was not intended to set a precedent. And some of the judges who
had been involved in the case were worried about the fact that matters
such as these were decided in the courts and recommended that it was for
Parliament to debate and decide these issues. The establishment of the
House of Lords' Select Committee was a move in this direction. As you know,
the Select Committee opposed the legalisation of active euthanasia and
assisted suicide, but did not pronounce on deliberate death-causing omissions.</P>

<P>So we are still left with the problem of drawing a line between euthanasia
omissions and non-euthanasia omissions. Well, it seems reasonable to suggest
- and it seems to be the practice in hospices - not to provide medical
treatment which no longer corresponds to the real situation of the patient,
either because it is disproportionate to any expected results or because
it imposes an excessive burden on the patient. For example, when death
is clearly imminent and inevitable, it seems reasonable to forego treatment
that would only secure a precarious and burdensome prolongation of life.</P>

<P>Indeed, if the patient is dying, even food and fluids could be justifiably
withheld if giving such sustenance was futile and burdensome. That is to
say, according to hospice ethics, it is justifiable to forego medical procedures
which are disproportionate to any expected results, and it is justifiable
to forego medical treatment and even food and fluids to avoid imposing
an excessive burden on the patient.</P>

<P>Take the example of a terminally ill cancer patient whose painful death
is being prolonged by artificial feeding. The patient's life might be prolonged
by weeks. If the patient expresses the wish no longer to be artificially
fed, then his request would be granted. For the feeding will not prolong
his life for very long anyway, and what would be the point in prolonging
the process of dying? In this situation, provision of food and fluids could
be described as both futile and too burdensome. </P>

<P>Of course, in some situations it may be difficult to say whether a treatment
is too burdensome. In this respect the suicidal person poses a special
problem. For he or she might describe just about any treatment as too burdensome.
Here I think that wisdom, experience and compassion are required to decide
whether a certain treatment is or is not too burdensome. What is required
is care based on shared understanding of the sick person's suffering -
and this understanding only comes with experience.</P>

<P>In November 1995, my centre, the Centre for Bioethics and Public Policy,
organised a conference in Brussels. The theme was euthanasia and there
were a number of British experts on palliative care in attendance. Interestingly,
they all testified to the fact that good palliative care is the best answer
to a demand for euthanasia. The request for euthanasia is usually a request
for help,they said. When receiving good palliative care, even depressed
terminally ill patients seem to regain a taste for life.</P>

<P>However, if the patient cannot speak for himself, the situation is quite
different. How is one to decide what constitutes disproportionate treatment
in those circumstances? Here there is no question of the treatment being
too burdensome. What matters here is whether it is proportional to expected
results. If a certain treatment gives hope of recovery, it should obviously
be given, but otherwise their is little point in it. In other words, if
a dying patient gets pneumonia, there is clearly no point in giving him
antibiotics. And to take the difficult situation of a PVS patient, if one
can be sure that there is no misdiagnosis, then even in this case it might
be argued that giving antibiotics to overcome pneumonia would be pointless,
for it would not help the patient to get over the main irreversible and
severe condition from which ne is suffering.</P>

<P>But could the same argument be applied to food and fluids? Is the provision
of food and fluids more basic than the proivision of antibiotics and indeed
so basic that we cannot deprive a person of food and fluids unless he is
dying and has asked for it? If the food and fluid were to make the patient
more comfortable there would certainly be a point in it. But if it obvious
that feeding him is futile and will only prolong the process of dying,
then it cannot be in the patient's best interest to pump food or fluids
into him only to prolong the inevitable.</P>

<P>A PVS patient, however, is not actually dying, though he will forever
remain in a state of unawareness of the world around him. So the question
is whether in this situation tube-feeding should be regarded as obligatory
care. The answer is that the kind or level of care that should be provided
must be decided by considering a number of circumstances. Those who are
in the caring professions know that experience is the only teacher of good
judgement in the concrete situation. And to argue that withholding or withdrawal
of food and fluid from PVS patients might in some circumstances be justified,
would not be the same as advocating euthanasia by omission.</P>

<P>Take the case of a patient who has been in a PVS for five years. Is
it right to keep him in such a state of suspended animation for years and
years to come? Is it right towards the patient, and is it right towards
the relatives? And is it right to provide nursing care indefinitely for
a person in that state if there is a shortage of staff or other resources?
These are big questions - and it is not for me to provide all the answers.</P>

<P>But let me repeat, what matters here is experience coupled with a caring
attitude. Without experience, which can only be gained by practice, it
is impossible to understand what treatment might improve or ease a patient's
condition and what is futile treatment, or to understand what is medically
possible and what is not. As to the attitude required in caring for the
gravely ill and those who suffer, it is that of the Good Samaritan. The
Good Samaritan was moved by compassion and recognized the injured man by
the wayside as his neighbour, as a fellow human being, and treated him
as he would have wanted to be treated himself.</P>

<TITLE>Research findings - Physician assisted suicide</title>

<head><h2>Research findings - Physician assisted suicide</h2></head>
<br><br>
In a survey published 23rd May, the first of its kind in Britain, it is revealed that a majority of doctors in Britain believe they should be allowed to help suffering patients to end their lives.
<br><br>
Professor Sheila McLean, who is Professor of Law & Ethics in Medicine at Glasgow University, has conducted Britain's first ever research into the issue, the aim of which, she says, is to draft a bill which would legalise physician-assisted suicide. The controversial step would require the support of the medical profession. Her survey results indicate that she has the majority of the medical profession on her side.
<br><br>
Under the law in Britain at the moment, prescribing lethal drugs to help someone to die can be punished as culpable homicide in Scotland or as assted suicide/manslaughter in England.
<br><br>
54% of the doctors who responded to the confidential questionnaire said they would support a change in the law that would allow them to help patients to die. 16% said they would help in terminal cases, 11% in cases of physical suffering, and 7% simply if the patient wished it. A considerable proportion said they been asked by a patient to assist in suicide, and 3% admitted that they had in the past helped patients to die, and privately  the figure is thought to be higher.
<br><br>
The Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society commented:<br><br>
This ground-breaking research is most encouraging - it seems to confirm what we suspected, that a majority of doctors are caring people who want to respect their patients' wishes - even when doing so would mean prescribing drugs that would enable a suffering patient to choose quality over quantity of life. Until now, patients have not had the support of the medical profession or the law when taking these difficult decisions - this is one of the reasons why the Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society issues, under certain conditions, literature on "self-deliverance." We hope now that parliament will recognise the wishes of the public, the medical profession, and the humaneness of allowing death with dignity at a time of a patient's own choosing. We know there will be problems with any such legislation, but such problems are not insurmoutable - by doing nothing we would simply allow a heartless sentence to run its course for individuals whose indignity and suffering cannot be relieved - people deserve the key to the door marked "Exit" if that is what they want.
<br><br>
VESS made a grant of 42,000 available to Glasgow University to perform the research.

<H1>Benefits of a Code of Ethics</H1>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A code of ethics developed from the basic principles of
Mensa's Constitution would be acceptable whether defended from altruistic
or self-improvement motives.</FONT></P>

<LI>1. To be a socially responsible organisation</LI>

<LI>2. To provide Employees and Official with guidelines</LI>

<LI>3. To establish a better corporate culture</LI>

<LI>4. To improve Mensa's public image</LI>

<LI>5. To improve management</LI>

<LI>6. To minimize the risk of white collar crime</LI>

<H4>Whilst the development of a Business Code of Ethics is a highly skilled
and specialised task, implementation of conflict-avoiding ethical procedures
can often be achieved by calling on the experience and free assistance
of bodies such as the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations. External
standards, of themselves, tend to reduce friction from internal factions.</H4>

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>The Greatest Agent of All</STRONG></FONT><P>


	The most successful agent of all time, Ben Feldman, fit no mold.  When he was about to
enter to the
business of selling individual insurance, he thought of himself as "a hayseed, a hick from
the sticks -
how could I sell life insurance?  They told me I didn't look the part ..."<P>


	Knocking on the door of a New York Life manager in Youngstown, Ben sat down and took an
aptitude
test.  He failed to fit the formula.  A vice president emphatically said, "This ordinary
business isn't for
you.  You'll fall flat on your face."  Ben kept returning, the essence of persistence.  "You
toss me out this
door," he would say to the people in Youngstown, "and I'll come back in that one."  When he
finally
joined the company, on February 15, 1942, he was 29.

<P>


	He quietly made people conscious that his company controlled more money than many of the
flashier establishments and that it had paid dividends and kept all its promises for
generations.  With
those credentials out of the way, he presented himself as a high-level specialist who stood
outside the
traditional business hierarchy.  If he needed to get a skeptic's attention, he wrapped five
$100 bills in a
note reading, "I'll swap these for five minutes." <P>
<P>
	Every sales agent has a unique sales strategy, but none were as successful as Ben
Feldman.  Ben
was Top Club president in 1955 and led the company in sales every year thereafter until the
late 1970s,
when he asked that his name be removed from all sales results lists.  During the 1970s, Ben
annually
outsold 1,500 of the industry's 1,800 companies.  In 1992, New York Life ran a sales contest
to
commemorate Ben's 50th year with the company.  The winner?  Eighty-year-old Ben Feldman.

<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Site Navigation Tips</STRONG></FONT><P>

We have incorporated several features to make is easy for you to make your way around this site.<P>  

<STRONG>Relative Location Within the Site</STRONG><BR>
At the top of this page, you can see a header entitled "Welcome".  Other pages in this site have similar headers and, in some cases, subheaders.  A subheader will be located directly beneath the header (this page has no subheader).  The header and subheader indicate your relative location in the site.<P>

<STRONG>Returning to the Top of a Section or Subsection</STRONG><BR>
If the headers or subheader is bright blue it is an active "hyperlink".

If you click on a blue header title, the top level page for that section will be displayed.

If you click on a smaller blue subheader title, the top level page for that particular subsection will be displayed.<P>



<STRONG>Navigating Within a Section or Subsection</STRONG><BR>
At the bottom of most pages within a section, you will also see lateral links to other pages within that section. <P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>The page you are on will be displayed in bold type, but will not be active.  For example, at the bottom of this page, you can see that you are on the "Site Navigation Tips" page.  <BR>

	<LI>Any other pages listed are active links. For example, you can click on the "Welcome" link below to connect to that page.  Try it now!

	On April 12, 1845, twenty public-spirited men arrived at fifty-seven Wall Street on
horseback and in
fine carriages for a brisk meeting that established the purpose of the company that would
soon be
named New York Life.  It was time, they felt, for a bold experiment.  Their mission was to
focus the
energies of the young company on the mutual life insurance business so it could capitalize on
the
opportunities they saw ahead.<P>
<P>  
	The benefits of membership in a mutual society were spelled out in one of new York
Life's first
advertisements.  "One of the peculiar advantages attending insurance with this company is
that all the
assureds share annually in its profits and are interested in its success."  The trustees of
the company
pledged that company funds would "be invested for the benefit and security of all the parties
involved."<P>
	Underwriting American lives in the perilous mid-nineteenth century was a new game that
had to be
invented.  By today's standards, it was an era of unusual risks and uncertainties.  The
hazards of
pioneer life took a heavy toll, as did wars on the frontier, outbreaks of disease, poor water
and sewage
systems, and cities and towns made of wood that often burned to the ground, causing large
losses of life.

<P>
	Life insurance companies and agents in the nineteenth century faced a challenging task: 
creating
consumer demand for a product that was largely unknown.  Assigning a dollar value to human
life
seemed irreligious to some.  Others associated life insurance with gambling.  Despite the
public's lack
of awareness regarding the need for life insurance and the difficulties of estimating the
hazards of
human life, New York Life accumulated assets of $1 million during its first decade.  Building
and
maintaining a strong financial foundation allowed it to pay out another $1 million to policy
holders and
beneficiaries during that decade.

 "While nothing is more uncertain than the duration
of a
single life, nothing is more certain than the average duration of a thousand lives," said the
great life
insurance authority himself, actuary Elizur Wright.  The broader the coverage of the
population, the more
favorable the averages.  In an age of primitive medicine and harsh everyday risks ranging
from
contaminated food to unsafe buildings, New York Life managed the risks by cultivating an
in-house
ability to assess risks that was second to none.<P>
	In 1892, the era of "scientific" management was just beginning, and the trio of George
Perkins,
Darwin Kingsley, and Thomas A. Buckner would lead the company in it.<P>

	Perkins was given the daunting job of reorganizing the entire sales operation.  He
upgraded the
company's sales force and replaced the general agency system with a new marketing structure.  
Of all Perkins' innovations, creating a corps of professionally trained, full-time agents did
the most to
advance the reputation of the life insurance industry as a business on the same footing as
banking.  To
improve the quality of service to policy owners, to stem the widespread turnover in the
business and to
eliminate the erratic sales performance of the less-dedicated agents, the company created a
new
method of compensation called "Nylic for Agents."<P>
	Under this plan, an agent received a guaranteed lifetime monthly income after twenty
years of
service, provided he did not enter the service of another life insurance company.  His
lifetime monthly
income was based on his sales production during those twenty years.  The plan's deferred
compensation and old-age security elements were rare for any industry in 1895.<P>
	
	 With Chairman McCall's full encouragement, Perkins proceeded to select the
branch
managers, who in turn recruited and supervised the activities of individual agents whose
contracts were
made directly with the company rather than with the intermediary general agent.<P>
	McCall and Perkins took their inventiveness to other departments as well.  In 1892, the
company
astonished the industry by offering a policy that swept away all restrictions except the
insured's
obligation to pay the premium on time.  Standard policies were then riddled with restrictive
clauses and
exceptions, often to the dismay of hard-selling agents.<P>
	The policy introduced by New York Life in 1892 removed all previous restrictions with
respect to
occupation, residence, travel lifestyles or manner of death.  Also for the first time in
1892, a life
insurance policy included a policy loan feature.  To cement New York Life's intention to
provide
coverage, regardless of the circumstances, the company determined that after one year the
policy was
incontestable.<P>
	" . . . What may be called the Life Insurance Era began about 1845; what may be called
the
'Crusades' began about 1890."  The results, said Kingsley, dwarfed any other business
undertaking.  In
1898,  "The Great International Life Insurance Company" appeared on the company's letterhead
and on
its policies.  New York Life had by then extended operations far beyond U.S. boundaries to
eighty-three
countries, and on May 23, 1899, it reached $1 billion in policies in force.  For almost half
a century, the
company worked hard to create and broaden a global market for life insurance until war on an
unprecedented scale in 1914 brought the crusade to an end.

	During the first third of the twentieth century, punch-card machines based on Dr. Herman
Hollerith's electrical tabulatory equipment
were sped up and modified.  New and faster equipment was designed to handle payroll,
accounting,
billing, sales analysis and other areas.<P>
	By World War II, the leap was made into electronic equipment.  ENIAC (Electronic
Numerical
Integrator and Calculator) was developed at the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of
Electrical
Engineering by J. Presper Eckert and physicist Dr. John W. Mauchly.  They eliminated the need
for
moving parts by adapting electronic circuits and using electronic pulses to flip vacuum tubes
on and off
like switches, with the "on" and "off" states representing zeroes and ones, the roots of
computers'
binary language.  <P>
	New York Life took delivery of its first modern computers in the 1950s - one from RCA and
one from
IBM.
<P>

	Paternal management made everyone feel like a member of a big extended family.  As a
perquisite,
the company acquired two employee vacation properties, located in the rural Bear Mountain
region of
New York State about an hour's drive north of New York City.  Camp Nylic, for male employees
and
their families, offered cabins named after company officers.  Women employees were housed
separately at Elm Valley Farm, twenty-five miles away. The rate charged for full room and
board was $1
a day.  Anyone sent to the camps for convalescence by the medical department got in free.<P>
	One of the most conspicuous results of the company's prudent management was unveiled in
1928 when the company moved into its new Manhattan Home Office at 51 Madison Avenue.  
In 1889, the first Madison Square Garden occupied the site.  New Yorkers  for the next
thirty years
turned to the Garden for championship fights, operatic recitals, six-day bicycle races, horse
shows and
a potpourri of live entertainment.<P>
	The cornerstone of New York Life's new Home Office was laid with appropriate ceremony on
June
17, 1927.  Architect Cass Gilbert, famous at the time for many structures - including the
Woolworth
Building, once New York's tallest and the U.S. Supreme Court Building - had prepared plans to
build "a
Cathedral of Life Insurance," using the Salisbury Cathedral in England as the inspiration. 
In November
1928, the entire office force from 346 Broadway moved into the new quarters, requiring
practically every
piece of moving equipment in the city for all the files and furniture.<P>
	An opening-day speech by New York Life President Darwin P. Kingsley was broadcast
nationwide
over NBC.  President Calvin Coolidge pressed a button in the White House that unfurled the
United
States flag in the lobby of the new building.<P>
	For the life insurance industry, the downward plunge in the thirties was just as
spectacular as the
boom of the twenties.  Yet New York Life, without taking elaborate preventive measures,
preserved the
assets of its policy owners.  With no equities in its portfolio, it was able to exercise
tight control over its
own destiny. Unlike many other life insurers, New York Life's receipts continued to exceed
disbursements.  In 1933, the deepest year of the depression, the company met obligations of
$366
million and still managed to increase assets to over $2 billion.

	Just prior to the war's outbreak, New York Life had begun to give serious consideration
and intensive
study to housing as a medium for direct equity investments.  By 1946, the company was ready
to
proceed with a long-range program of investing in owned and managed housing developments.<P>
	In October 1949, the last of 3,000 families moved into Fresh Meadows, a 173-acre,
self-contained
community of 10,000 people in Queens, New York.  Built on a former golf course, Fresh Meadows
contained a department store, banks, a theater, doctors' offices, restaurants, fifty
specialty shops, a
bowling center, a post office, and a school.<P>
	All told, the housing effort was enormous.  The company estimated that it had provided,
in the five
years between 1946 and 1950, enough apartments and small homes for 300,000 people.  Besides
providing owned and managed housing in New York, New Jersey, and housing on a former slum site
in
Chicago, some $778 million was invested in more than 79,000 residential mortgage loans around
the
country, most of them for less than $10,000 each.<P>
	
	New York Life also led the way in recognizing the need for new methods to finance
thousands of
miles of superhighways, parkways, thruways, turnpikes, bridges, and tunnels as auto and truck
traffic
increased.  The company proposed revenue bonds as an alternative to government borrowing,
which
would increase federal, state, and local taxes.<P>
	For over a century, New York Life had confined its business to "ordinary" whole life
insurance for the
individual. In 1951, it was the world's largest in this category, with over 4 million
policies in force. 
During World War II, however, the inclusion of fringe benefits in labor contracts stimulated
the growth of
group insurance.  After the war, management-labor bargaining led to an almost universal use
of group
life and health insurance in multi-year contract packages.<P>
	In the mid-1950s, the company positioned itself to become more of a financial services
company
than a life insurer.  The notion of cradle to grave private insurance was revolutionary, and
New York Life
prepared to meet the ever-growing needs of the expanding nation.<P>
	While new products and services were being developed, the Home Office decided its
traditional
business needed a thorough shaking-up as well.  Assumptions, policy language, and premiums
were
not keeping pace with the rapid changes of the national economy and demographics; the
contracts
customers were signing as the company entered the 1950s were nearly the same as those their
grandfathers had signed decades ago.<P>
	When President Devereaux C. Josephs implemented a new product line, every other big
insurer tried
to follow New York Life's lead.  But New York Life agents had the pioneering advantage.  They
were first
in the market with products specifically designed for an insurance-buying public that was
becoming
more value and cost-conscious.  Everyone seemed to be going up a notch or two on the economic
ladder in one of the swiftest and most thoroughgoing changes in history.

	The 1957-79 period encompasses a considerable amount of the company's history.  Yet the
point is
worth making that the series of episodes recounted here, the people, the product development
and the
evolution of sales, management and electronic systems, took place in an environment of
unalloyed
American optimism.  While the United States had diverse view points on almost everything from
education to entertainment, practically everyone felt that the unique American democratic
system would
provide a better and better standard of living for all.  The great American boom became a
standard part
of life, no more surprising than Detroit's ads plugging the two-car family, or each family's
dream of the
three-bedroom suburban home.<P>
	The Keogh plan, named after a U.S. congressman from Brooklyn, was enacted in 1962,
making
tax-free private pension funding almost universal in the United States.  In the expanding
world of
savings, "investing for growth" had become as legitimate and desirable as "investing for
income."  The
new mindset created increased competition between different sectors of the financial services
industry.<P>
	In the midst of an increasingly competitive climate, the life insurance industry seemed
to be thriving. 
The number of life insurance companies grew by the hundreds in the 1960s and 1970s.  The
Institute
of Life Insurance's surveys showed that 85 percent of American families had some sort of life
insurance coverage; in more than half the families, all members of the household were
insured.  But
the percentage of disposable income spent on life insurance was declining every year, and
there
seemed to no way to stop it.  A strategic move into an expanding market like equities seemed
inevitable.<P>
	The exciting actuarial breakthrough made by Charles Sternhell, John Fraser, and Walter
Miller in 1969
opened the door to the move into equities.  Their discovery that the premium basis for a
variable policy
could be the same as for a fixed-dollar policy brought them industry-wide acclaim.<P>
	The rest of the industry created products from the New York Life formula, but the
company did not
enter the business until 1983, when it became possible to pay regular commissions on variable
life.  In
retrospect, it was the best possible decision, and not just for the protection of the agency
force.  Equities
- and the new variable life policies - did not perform well in the seventies.

	To maintain its top ratings, which became more important as the 1980s rolled on, New York
Life
moved cautiously into making some major investment portfolio adjustments.  In 1982, the
company
smoothly completed a $1.6 billion restructuring of its pension fund portfolio, which
measurably
increased the quality of its security holdings.  This immense transaction, achieved with the
help of
trading experts at Salomon Brothers, involved the sale of 104 issues and the purchase of 57
others. 
Computer simulation prior to the actual event made the transaction go through without a
glitch.<P>
	The stock market crash of 1987 prompted another major shift in investment strategy.  In
October
1987, the stock market lost twenty-two percent of its value in a day after five fat years
during which the
Dow Jones industrial average roared from below 1000 to 2700.  New York Life saw the value of
its bond
portfolio rise sharply as the stock market tumbled.<P>
	Competition for consumers' dollars brought intense challenges to New York Life's
individual
insurance operations.  More and more Americans were making a distinction between the
protection
afforded by insurance and the investment potential of permanent, cash value insurance, which
they
viewed as inferior to CDs and other investments.  The logic of this comparison seemed to
dictate "buy
term and invest the difference."<P>
	Anyone combing through the $8 trillion financial-services world in the late 1980s for a
blue-chip firm
with the ability to tailor products to the needs of all sorts of individuals and groups would
find the search
daunting.  Credit ratings systems were so lax, by design or otherwise, the resulting
information could
really turn out to be misinformation.<P>
	Some straight talk was needed about the value of safety, security and conservatism in
the investment
field.  "The Company You Keep" slogan was first seen by American consumers September 17,
1989, in
a New York Life TV commercial.<P>
	Plenty of investors had been burned in the biggest stock market crash of all time just
two years
earlier.  In a culture of seemingly permanent change, when beliefs as well as institutions
were
crumbling everywhere, a simple message had appeal:  good, old, reliable New York Life was as
sound
as ever.

	When Chairman Harry Hohn was asked in 1994 to describe New York Life's most difficult long-term
problem, he
summed up the answer in a single word: "demographics."<P>
	The official demographic measurement of household income in 1990 provided by the U.S.
government was a bit shocking.  Not all boats had risen in the 1980s.  In 1990, according to
the IRS,
some ten percent of U.S. households had incomes over $75,000.  That was the good news.  But
the
remaining 90 percent were hardly awash in wealth.  The majority of households, three-quarters
of the
total, had incomes under $50,000.  And a remarkable forty-two percent were living by the skin
of their
teeth.  Just as the government had plunged into deficit financing, so had individuals.<P>

	
	In a drive to find new avenues of distribution, New York Life created the Brokerage
Department in
1992.  Its focus is and has been independent producers who serve customers in the top one to
two
percent of the wealthiest households in the United States and large corporate clients.<P>

	
	The experience with the brokerage business encouraged New York Life to seek other
distribution
opportunities.  In a departure from the way it traditionally sells products, the company
announced a
unique 10-year direct marketing opportunity in April 1994.  The American Association of
Retired
Persons (AARP), a 33-million-member organization dedicated to addressing the needs of persons
aged 50 and older, selected New York Life Insurance Company from numerous competitors to
underwrite, market and administer a newly designed life insurance program for its members.<P>
	
<P>
	In 1984, New York Life expanded its investments focus to include the independent active
management of stocks and bonds by purchasing MacKay-Shields Financial Corporation, a
blue-chip, active money
manager
based in Manhattan.  In 1987, Monitor Capital Advisors was created as an independent
subsidiary of
New York Life focusing on the passive, quantitative strategies of stocks and bonds.  In 1988,
Greystone
Realty Corporation, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, was founded to provide independent
professional management of equity real estate.<P>
	<P>
	In order to compete effectively in the ever-expanding defined contribution market, the
company made
a major acquisition that year, buying a Boston-based benefits consulting and administrative
firm, now
renamed New York Life Benefit Services.  New York Life now has the capabilities to compete as a
"full-service"
provider in the 401(k) market.<P>
	The company had reentered the international life insurance market in 1988 with the
acquisition of a
life insurance company in Hong Kong. That year, it formed New York Life Worldwide.  The
international
re-entry continued in 1989 with the acquisition of Windsor Group, a life insurance firm based
in
England.  Three years later, the Gresham Group, another British life insurer, was acquired.
<P>
	Ever since its founding, New York Life managers and agents have been conscious that the
actions of
the company are often far reaching.  The character, and perhaps the stability, of American
society have
been affected by organizations that try to look beyond the statistics to act as good
corporate citizens.<P>
	"[I describe] life insurance using the Latin sui generis."  Hohn continues, "Sui generis
means 'unique
unto itself.'  And life insurance is unique unto itself.  It's the only way that you can have
a person who
just gets married and has the first baby or two and provide for them right then and there by
paying a
premium on a life insurance policy.  That's invaluable.  That's unique.  And that's one of
the reasons
why we are in business - to provide those benefits.<P>
	"Suppose there weren't life insurance - how would you arrange for your own family?  We
provide a
very basic tenet that we all rely upon.  We do a lot of other things but that's our core
competency, and we
do it, I think, very well.<P>
	And so we're going to be around for another 150 years - and more.  You can count on it."

<B><FONT SIZE=4>Quarterly Economic Update</FONT></B><BR>
<STRONG>November 1996</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>Back to above trend growth in 1997</STRONG><BR>
After surging to 4.7 percent in the second quarter, real GDP growth slowed to an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the third quarter. Stagnating consumer spending, along with sharp declines in housing, government purchases, and net exports were offset by a surge in business investment and inventory accumulation.  In the fourth quarter, growth should remain sluggish due to a slower rate of inventory accumulation, but final demand is set to pick up again.  With real disposable income up about 3.0 percent from a year ago and the unemployment rate down to 5.2 percent from 5.6 percent, consumer confidence is near a seven-year high.  Under these conditions, the recent decline in bond yields and the surging stock market should encourage a revival in housing as well as a good Christmas shopping season.
<P>
For the second half of the year, real GDP growth is expected to average about 2.1 percent -- well below the first half average of 3.3 percent and slightly below the economy's long-term non-inflationary growth potential. Once the inventory correction is over, however, the economy should have the momentum to maintain above trend growth until it is slowed by the Federal Reserve.  For the year as a whole, economic activity should be up a moderate 2.3 percent, and 1997 is expected to show a stronger 2.9 percent increase, with help from strengthening economies in Europe, Japan, Canada, and Mexico.
<P>
<STRONG>Inflation still subdued, but set for upward creep</STRONG><BR>
After six years of economic expansion, there are still few signs of accelerating inflation.  However, the unemployment rate has fallen well below levels previously associated with rising inflation, and wage rates have begun to accelerate again.  So far, decelerating benefit costs have offset most of the wage acceleration, but this cannot continue indefinitely.  The current slowdown has been just in time to relieve these emerging inflationary pressures, but as the economy picks up speed again next year, they are likely to reemerge.  Any slack created by the slowdown will be quickly eliminated as growth picks up again, and more definitive inflationary pressures will emerge.  After rising 2.8 percent in 1995, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) should be up 3.0 percent this year and 3.2 percent in 1997.
<P>
<STRONG>Fed tightening postponed</STRONG><BR>
Following three easing moves, the Federal Reserve has left monetary policy unchanged since February and is not likely to begin tightening credit conditions again until some time next year.  There appears to be increasing political pressure to wait and see how long the economic slowdown lasts or how low unemployment can fall before inflation picks up again.  It may be that the rate of unemployment that sparks inflation has indeed shifted downward somewhat in recent years due to demographics and other factors, but as it becomes clear that the unemployment rate has resumed its downward movement, the Fed is likely to begin a series of tightening moves. 
<P>

<STRONG>Bond yield up-trend to resume</STRONG><BR>
Long-term bond yields have declined from their recent highs in response to the Federal Reserve's decisions not to tighten monetary policy at its September and November FOMC meetings and economic statistics that appear to have justified these decisions.  Post-election promises to continue budget deficit reduction efforts also have helped.  As the economy picks up again next year, however, the up-trend in interest rates, both short- and long-term, should resume and continue until the Fed has succeeded in slowing the economy again.  This is likely to require a flattening of the yield curve, with short-term interest rates rising faster than long-term rates.
<P>
<STRONG>Ideal equity market conditions not likely to continue</STRONG><BR>  
When the economy is near full employment, too much growth is just as bad for the stock market as too little.  So far this year, the economy has been just right.  The bull market for equities has been driven by the continuation of moderate growth, strong earnings gains, and low inflation.  These ideal conditions are likely to change next year.  While earnings should remain relatively good, economic growth may look a little too strong, inflation will be creeping up again, bond yields will be rising, and the Federal Reserve will be tightening.  As the economic expansion continues into its seventh year, there will be increasing concerns about the emergence of late business cycle pressures on profitability and the arrival of the next recession.

<B><FONT SIZE=4>Weekly Economic Commentary</FONT></B>
<P>
<I>For the week of December 2, 1996 <BR>
</I>
<P>
Bond yields fell and stock prices rose in response to mixed evidence
on economic growth, accompanied by continued good news on inflation.
Third quarter growth was revised downward, but with less inventory
accumulation going into the fourth quarter. Personal income was
unchanged in October, but consumer spending was stronger than
expected. Construction expenditures also rose strongly in October,
as strength in government and private nonresidential categories
more than offset weakness in residential. October new home sales
were down more than expected. The Purchasing Managers' Index rebounded
in November, showing a pick-up in the manufacturing sector, but
the prices paid index declined, indicating no build up of inflation
pressures.<BR>

<P>
<B>Downward revision in 3rd quarter growth</B> 
<P>
Real GDP growth for the third quarter was revised downward to
2.0 percent from a previously estimated 2.2 percent. The sharpest
downward revisions, however, were in net exports and the rate
of inventory accumulation -- a positive sign for the fourth quarter.
Consumer spending, capital investment, and government purchases
were revised upward.<BR>

<P>
<B>Personal income flat, consumer spending stronger</B>
<P>
Personal income was unchanged in October after rising 0.6 percent
in both August and September. Wage and salary income declined
as a decline in average weekly hours more than offset an increase
in employment. However, personal consumption expenditures rose
a stronger than expected 0.5 percent after an increase of only
0.1 percent the month before.<BR>

<P>
<B>Consumer confidence unchanged in November</B>
<P>
The Conference Board's Index of Consumer Confidence was 107.3
in November, the same relatively high level as in October. This
is good news for the holiday shopping season. <BR>

<P>
<B>Construction spending up sharply</B>
<P>
Total construction spending was up a stronger than expected 1.8
percent in October, following a rise of 1.2 percent the month
before. The increase was led by government and private nonresidential
spending. The residential construction category showed a decline.

<P>
<B>New home sales down again</B>
<P>
Sales of new single family homes fell a steeper than expected
8.7 percent in October. This follows a 4.5 percent decline in
September and leaves new home sales at their lowest level since
March.<BR>

<P>
<B>Purchasing managers report rebound in manufacturing growth</B>
<P>
The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a higher than expected
52.7 percent in November after falling to 50.2 percent the month
before. Production, employment, new orders, vendor deliveries,
and inventories all contributed to the rise. Nevertheless, the
prices paid index declined from 47.1 percent to 45.9 percent,
indicating a faster rate of decline in prices.<BR>

New York Life and its subsidiaries comprise the fourth largest life insurance company in the nation,
measured by assets and revenues.  In 1995, we continued to extend our reach in a number of
important product lines, including individual annuities and managed health care.  We also extended
our reach geographically, opening a second representative office in mainland China.<P>

	This year, changes within New York Life created six primary business units as opposed to our
previous five.  Our Group indemnity and Sanus HMO operations were reorganized to form NYLCare
Health Plans, Inc.  The remaining Group lines of business were consolidated into a new one, Special
Markets.

<P>New York Life Worldwide Holding, Inc., formed in 1988 and located in New York City, is an indirect,
wholly-owned subsidiary of New York Life Insurance Company, which was the fourth largest life
insurance company by assets in the United States in 1995.  Through Worldwide Holding, New
York Life and its affiliates conduct business internationally in Argentina, Bermuda, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom.  In China, Worldwide Holding
also has representative offices in Guangzhou and Shanghai.

<P><STRONG>Hong Kong - (1988)</STRONG>  New York Life Insurance Worldwide Ltd., located in Hong
Kong, was the first company that Worldwide Holding incorporated to re-enter* the
international marketplace.  This Company has experienced dynamic growth and  in the past year
has doubled its agency force.  Worldwide Holding also has a regional office in Hong Kong to
support operations in the Pacific Rim. (* New York Life Insurance Company had a global
presence more than 100 years ago and had business operations in some 50 to 60 countries prior
to World War I.)<P>

<STRONG>United Kingdom - (1989)</STRONG>  Worldwide Holding began in the U.K. by acquiring
the Windsor group of insurance companies.  It then moved to capitalize on this expertise by
joining with the St. James Place Capital and other investors from the Life Assurance Holding
Corporation, Ltd., which acquires and manages existing insurance companies and their
portfolios.<P>

<STRONG>Indonesia - (1991)</STRONG>  P.T. Asuransi Jiwa Sewu New York Life, with headquarters
in Jakarta, has in just four years moved to number five in market share.  SEWU New York
Life's field force of over 1,500 agents, many of whom are Million Dollar Round Table
qualifiers, includes the top producing agent in all of Indonesia.  Worldwide Holding's
partner in this joint venture is a respected Indonesian company, P.T. Gunung Sewu Kencana.
<P>

<STRONG>Taiwan - (1992)</STRONG>  Worldwide Holding's insurance business in Taiwan is
managed
as a branch of New York Life Insurance &amp; Annuity Corporation.  It has succeeded in a highly
competitive market, and in 1996 it became the only insurance company to have won three
prestigious industry awards in the same year:  "Company of the Year," "Product of the Year,"
and "Man of the Year".<P>

<STRONG>Mexico - (1993)</STRONG>  New York Life Worldwide Holding acquired an interest in the
OLMECA Group's life insurance business, which is located in Mexico City.  The new company,
GEO New York Life, opened for business in the Fall of 1993.  In spite of the challenging
market conditions in Mexico, GEO has consistently made its market goals through aggressive
recruiting and excellent training for its field force.<P>

<STRONG>South Korea - (1993)</STRONG>  In South Korea, Worldwide Holding joined with KOHAP,
a
large textile conglomerate, to establish a joint venture company, KOHAP New York Life
Insurance Ltd.  As a newly established company in a very competitive environment, KOHAP NYL
has succeeded by distinguishing itself in its excellent training and development of its field
force.  As a result of this and strong recruiting efforts, the field force has nearly doubled
in the past year.<P>

<STRONG>Argentina - (1994)</STRONG>  When Argentina's social security system was privatized,
Worldwide Holding moved aggressively to gain a strategic position in the marketplace.  It
purchased interests in three Argentinean financial services companies,
including La Buenos Aires New York Life Vida and La Buenos Aires New York Life Retiro, a life
insurance and an annuity company respectively.  By year end 1995, La Buenos Aires New York
Life Vida ranked number two in life insurance sales in Argentina.<P>

<STRONG>Bermuda - (1995)</STRONG>  To meet the demands of another global market
opportunity, Worldwide Holding formed New York Life Worldwide (Bermuda) Ltd., an offshore
company, to serve international high net worth individuals and the corporate-owned life
insurance market.  Its products and services are distributed through a select group of
brokers and private banking sponsors.

<STRONG>What Your Agent Does for You</STRONG>
<P>
The key to achieving long-term objectives is planning.  Your goal may be to fund your children's college educations, to protect your family during  your working years, or to guarantee your own retirement security.  These things won't happen by accident.  You must plan.  You need to know what you want to achieve and then map out a strategy that will help you achieve it.
<P>
 The good news:  You don't have to do it alone.  Your New York Life insurance agent does more than just sell insurance policies.  He or she is a professional problem solver who can help you identify the most cost-effective products to help you meet  your financial objectives. 
<P>
 Your New York Life agent provides a full range of services.  These include working with you to:

<OL>
<LI>	Review your individual situation and personal objectives.  Perhaps your needs are so clear that life and health insurance can be determined after a few minutes of conversation.  Or it may quickly become apparent that nothing short of a full-blown, detailed "fact finding" session is required, going beyond such basic vital statistics as birth dates, income assets, etc.
<P>
	Why is it important to probe and ask questions?  Three reasons: First, your situation and needs are different from those of your neighbors. Your agent needs to understand those differences.  Second, money is not a goal in and of itself; it is merely the means to an end.  (Your goal may be a comfortable, secure retirement.  However, the means to achieve that, for example, might be a retirement nest egg of $600,000.)  Finally, the more your agent knows about you, the more precise and on-target will be the recommendations you receive.  As a result, your agent may take some time to discuss - and even appear to be a bit nosy about - your hopes, dreams and objectives ... the things that really matter to you.  By the way, all information will remain strictly confidential.
<P>
<LI>	Analyze and review your needs.  As needed, your agent will work with you to identify and prioritize your objectives, then help establish benchmark goals.  This is important because we live in a world in which there are unlimited resources.  People often fail to achieve objectives because they try to accomplish too much at once, or they don't attach specific deadlines to their goals.
<P>
	For instance, you may have a desire to retire in comfort, make sure your children are able to graduate from college debt-free, plus vacation in the Caribbean every winter.  But your resources may say that you cannot do it all.
<P>
	Your New York Life agent can work with you and help you focus on what's most important to you.  Together, you may find it helpful to break down these goals into quantifiable objectives: accumulate $600,000 by age 65; have a college fund of $40,000 in 15 years; set aside $10,000 each year for vacationing.  Then you can look at available resources and decide which goals are realistic, which need to be adjusted and scaled down, and which simply must be abandoned.
<P>
<LI> 	Develop and implement a strategy to help you achieve your goals.  Based on the information you share and the goals and means you establish, you'll receive specific recommendations on where life and health insurance products can help.
<P>
<LI>Coordinate your financial activities.  If desired by you, your agent can also serve as a quarterback for you and the other members of your team of advisors.
<P>
<LI>Monitor progress, provide ongoing service as your needs and situation change over time. This is crucial.  Planning is not a one-shot deal.  Strategies need to be adjusted periodically.  Your agent will work with you over the years to help keep your program on track with your changing needs.  By the way, there is no charge for advice, planning or ongoing service provided by your New York Life agent.
</OL>

<P>
Your Role:  It's a crucial one.  Your agent cannot do it alone.   It's a two-way street.  The key to getting maximum value from your relationship with your agent is communication and candor.  Do the following:

<OL>
<LI>	Get acquainted.  It's recommended that you contact your agent and arrange a meeting to discuss the full extent of available services, and to review your situation.
<P>
<LI>	Educate your agent.  Don't expect a mind reader.  Your agent may anticipate many of your needs, but will not assume anything.  That's why it's so important that you be candid in providing information.
<P>
<LI>	Educate yourself.  At the same time, you too should be sure to ask a lot of questions.  Be nosy.  Ask for details and explanations about recommendations and  how certain plans may work.  Remember, the only dumb question is the one that isn't asked.
<P>
<LI>	Make it a team effort.  Work together.  Listen carefully to the recommendations, but remember - all decisions are yours.  Make sure you're comfortable with the outcome.
</OL>
<P>
Recommendation: Contact your New York Life insurance agent today.  Arrange an appointment.  There's no cost or obligation.

Estate planning is an important consideration for most of us.  If you have any assets, even
if you're
young, you should have a will.  A will ensures that your probate assets will be
distributed according
to your wishes after you pass away.  Proper estate planning can also prevent much of your
estate from
being taxed.  This section of the New York Life site provides information to help you
understand estate
planning.  <P>

New York Life is one of the nation's largest companies offering integrated financial products
and
services
that can help you conserve your estate. New York Life is committed to helping you determine
the
combination of
products and services
that is right for you.   If you require further information on any
product or service offered by New York Life, please send us a message!<P>

This section will evolve and expand in the months and years to come. If you need information
on estate conservation that you cannot find at this site, it will likely be added at some
point in
the future. 
To help us provide you with information that is meaningful to you, please send us a message

<STRONG><A HREF="pfepfl.html">Estate Planning:  It's a Fact of Life</A></STRONG><BR>
	Find out why estate planning is important, no matter how much - or how little - you think
you are
worth.  Everyone should include estate planning as part of their financial planning process.
<P>
<BR>
<STRONG><A HREF="pfepiw.html">The Importance of a Will</A></STRONG><BR>
	A will is an important document that everyone should have.  Maintaining an up to date
will
can
prevent bitter disputes between family members when you are gone.  It also ensures that your
assets are
distributed according to your wishes - not the state's discretion.<P>

<STRONG><A HREF="pfepze.html">The Zero Estate Tax Plan</A></STRONG><BR>
	The zero estate tax plan is a complex strategy that - when structured properly - may
provide you and
your spouse with an income in retirement, yet minimize the taxes assessed on your state when
you die.

	If you are like the majority of independent business owners, most of your
net

is tied up in
your
company.  Just as important, the business is the engine that fuels your family's
standard
of living.  It
provides their lifestyle and ongoing financial security.<P>
	Your business is also your greatest liability for those very same reasons. 
Should
anything happen
to
your business, your family's future would be jeopardized.<P>

	You are the key, the linchpin that holds it all together.  Your continued
management
know-how and

Keeping your business profitable is a full-time job - and then some.   Every day
can be a
challenge -
staying ahead of the competition, juggling accounts receivable and accounts

finding ever new
and exciting ways to cut expenses while boosting income, and so on.  It's not
easy, but as

	You've worked hard to establish your own business.  Many business owners

Life insurance is something none of us should be without.  If you have a
family,
you
want to ensure that your family is protected financially if you pass away. 
If
you do not
have a family, you still need life insurance to protect those who care
about you
from
experiencing a financial burden if you should die.  Life insurance can pay
for
the support 
of dependents following your death.  It also helps pay down your debts,
obligations, and
final expenses.  <P>

This section of the New York Life site can help you assess your life
insurance
needs.  It
also provides helpful information on the topic of life insurance, and the
differences
between different types of coverage.<P>

Before you make any  decisions about purchasing life insurance, it is
important
to consult
an insurance agent. Contact us if you would like a New York Life agent to
get in touch
with you.  Just click on the "Contact NYL" button above to send us a
message!<P>

This section of the site will grow over time.  As it grows, more
information
will be added,
and other issues will be discussed.  If there is anything you feel would be
valuable to
include in this section, please send us a message by clicking on the
"Contact
NYL" button
above.<P>

Don't forget to save and update life insurance information that is relevant
to
your current
situation in your Personal Folder.<P>

<STRONG>Here's a guide to help you navigate through this section of the
site:</STRONG><P>

<A HREF="pfwhnc.html">
<STRONG>Life Insurance Needs Calculator</FONT></STRONG></A><BR>
Use this calculator to help you determine your life insurance needs.<P>

<A HREF="pfwhpl.html">
<STRONG>Permanent Life Insurance</FONT></STRONG>
</A><BR>
Permanent life insurance may be right for you if you want the security of
life
insurance
coverage for the duration of your lifetime.  Click on this link to learn
more
about this
traditional form of life insurance.<P>

<A HREF="pfwhtp.html">
<STRONG>Term vs. Permanent Life Insurance</STRONG>
</A><BR>
Term life insurance is another type of life insurance that may be right for
you. 
This is
especially true if you are young, or do not have a lot of money to spend on
life
insurance. 
There's much more to term life insurance, however.  Select this section to
learn
about the
key differences between term and permanent insurance.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>The Executive Bonus Plan: Insurance Benefits for Valued Executives</STRONG></FONT><P>


<STRONG>Executive Bonus Plan: What Is It?</STRONG><BR>
Every successful business has at least one executive and, often, more than one
individual whose
contribution to
the business is invaluable. Naturally, you value their contribution and want to
provide these employees
with an
added incentive package that can help tie them to your business. One such incentive
is an Executive
Bonus Plan.
An Executive Bonus Plan, also known as a Section 162 plan, is a tax deductible way
for you, the
employer, to
selectively provide life insurance and supplemental retirement benefits to your
valued executives. <BR>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/nyl/images/pscpbp.gif" ALT="Graph" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0">

<STRONG>Benefits to the Employer </STRONG><BR>
An Executive Bonus Plan offers an employer the following features and benefits:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Tax deductible.
<LI>Covers select executives.
<LI>Does not require IRS approval.
<LI>Simple to create.
<LI>By funding with life insurance, the executive has an added incentive to stay
with the company, often
referred to
as "Golden Handcuffs."
<LI>The amount of life insurance coverage on select executives can vary.
</UL>
<P>

<STRONG>Benefits to the Owner/Employee</STRONG><BR>
As owner, you also have the right to apply for and own a life insurance policy on
your life.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>You own the policy.
<LI>If the corporation's tax bracket is higher than the owner/employee, more
after-tax dollars will be
available to
pay the premium.
<LI>Death benefit proceeds provide a source of income to your family upon death.
</UL>
<P>
<PRE>

</PRE>
<STRONG>IF SELECT EXECUTIVE  DIES </STRONG>
<IMG SRC="/nyl/images/pscpbp2.gif" ALT="Graph"  ALIGN=BOTTOM BORDER="0"> <BR>
<P>

<STRONG>Benefits to the Employee</STRONG><BR>
The select executive will receive many valuable benefits from this type of plan:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>Executive owns the life insurance and any cash values.
<LI>Personal insurance needs are met with business dollars. 
<LI>The policy's cash value can be used to supplement retirement income.
<LI>Death benefit proceeds may be income tax free.
<LI>Death benefit proceeds can be used for estate settlement costs or as a source
of funds for a buy-sell
agreement.
</UL>
<P>

<STRONG>How Does an Executive Bonus Plan Work?</STRONG><BR>
In this arrangement, an executive applies for and owns a personal life insurance
policy. The employer
pays the key
executive's life insurance premiums, either directly to the insurance company or as
a bonus to the
executive. In
most cases, the premiums are deductible to the company as a business expense.




<P>
<FONT SIZE="-1">Note: Although the premiums are included in the executive's current
income, the death
benefit
may be income tax
free.

<STRONG>Protect Your Most Valuable Asset </STRONG><BR>
As a successful business owner, you have worked hard to reach your goals and it is
possible
that your
business has become one of your most valuable assets. But, have you considered what
would
happen
to your business and family should you unexpectedly die or become disabled?
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Do your heirs have experience operating the business on a day-to-day basis?
<LI>Would your heirs be forced to sell the business?
<LI>Would your heirs receive a fair price?
<LI>Would the IRS seek a higher valuation for your business?
</UL>
<P>
These are difficult questions to answer. You owe it to yourself and your family to
protect
your years of
hard work. At New York Life, we are dedicated to meeting your personal and
financial goals.
Through
proper planning, you can secure the continuation of your business and the financial
security
of your
heirs. 
<P>
<STRONG>How Can You Protect Your Business and Family? </STRONG><BR>
The Buy-Sell Agreement <BR>
When examining different strategies, it is important to select one that insures a
smooth
transition of
ownership and protects your family's financial future. A buy-sell agreement can
help you
accomplish
this goal. <P>
A buy-sell agreement is a contract among business owners.  At the loss of an owner,
the
business
interest is transferred according to the terms of this contract. The other owner(s)
are
obligated to
purchase the deceased's business interest and the deceased's heirs are obligated to
sell. 
Just look
at what a buy-sell agreement can do:<P>
Your Heirs:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Are free of business worries and guaranteed to receive a fair price for the
sale of the
business
interest.
<LI>May help avoid some of the delays associated with probate.
</UL>

Surviving Owners:	
<UL> 
<LI>Will not have to worry about new and possibly unwanted partners.
<LI>Know the purchase price of the business beforehand.
<LI>Remain in good standing with clients and creditors through a smooth transition
of
ownership.
Simply put, a properly funded buy-sell agreement will benefit your family,
surviving owners
and
creditors. 
</UL>
<P>

<STRONG>Methods of Funding Available</STRONG><BR>

<P>
<STRONG>Option 1: Wait and Pay Cash</STRONG> <BR>
In this option, surviving owner(s) use cash at the death of a co-owner to fund the
buy-sell
agreement.
But, several drawbacks to this method exist.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>At death, funds may not be readily available for payment.
<LI>A savings plan accumulates funds over time. What if funds are needed tomorrow?
<LI>Will a savings plan be depleted to pay for unforeseen expenses?
<LI>Accumulation of cash may cause an accumulated earnings tax problem.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Option 2: Wait and Borrow Funds</STRONG><BR>
In this option, surviving owner(s) borrow funds, usually bank loans, at the death
of a
co-owner to fund
the buy-sell agreement. But, much like the first option, this method has drawbacks.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Future growth may be slowed due to an increase in expenses (repayment of loan).
<LI>Death of an owner may cause sales to decline, compounding the problem.
<LI>Death of an owner may make it difficult to receive a loan.
<LI>A surviving owner may have to sign for funds, exposing personal assets.
<LI>Surviving owners pay dollar for dollar plus interest for the deceased's
outstanding share
of the
business. 
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Option 3: Insurance: The Smart Choice</STRONG><BR>
Purchasing insurance can be the most cost effective funding option for a buy-sell
agreement.
Using
insurance as a funding vehicle will provide the following benefits:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Immediate availability of proceeds when death or disability occurs.
<LI>The funds used to buy the deceased's share are purchased for pennies on the
dollar.
<LI>Death benefit proceeds are generally income 
tax free.
<LI>Premiums may be significantly lower than the cost of repaying the loan
interest.
</UL>
<P>

<STRONG>The Types of Buy-Sell Plans Available</STRONG><BR>
What Will A Buy-Sell Agreement Accomplish?	
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Creates a market for the stock.
<LI>Sets a predetermined price at which owners 
   agree to buy and sell their shares.
<LI>Provides money to fund the plan.
</UL>
<P>

<STRONG>Cross Purchase Plan</STRONG><BR>
In this plan, owners enter into an agreement with one another. To fund this plan,
each owner
applies
for, owns, and pays the life insurance premiums on the other owners.
<p>
<IMG SRC="/nyl/images/pscpbs.gif" ALT="Diagram" ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER="0">
<p>

When an owner dies:	
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Life insurance proceeds are paid to the surviving owner(s) income tax free.
<LI>Proceeds are used to purchase the heirs' business interest.
<LI>Heirs receive an agreed-upon payment for their business interest.
<LI>Surviving owner(s) receive an increased cost basis for the acquired business
interest. 
</UL>
<P>

<STRONG>Entity Plan</STRONG> <BR>
In this plan, owners enter into an agreement with the business. The business
applies for,
owns, and
pays the life insurance premiums on each owner.<P>
When an owner dies:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The business will receive the life insurance proceeds.
<LI>The business uses the proceeds to purchase the deceased's business interest.
<LI>Heirs receive an agreed-upon price for their business interest.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Stock Redemption Plan</STRONG> <BR>
A stock redemption plan is an agreement between the business and its shareholders.
The
corporation
applies for, owns, and pays the life insurance premiums on each shareholder.
<P>
When a shareholder dies:<P>
<UL>
<LI>The corporation will receive the life insurance proceeds.
<LI>The corporation will use the proceeds to purchase the shareholder's outstanding
stock.
<LI>Heirs receive an agreed-upon price for the shareholder's outstanding stock.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Wait and See Plan</STRONG> <BR>
This buy-sell agreement provides an added level of flexibility, providing the
advantages of
the cross
purchase and entity plans.<P>
<UL>
<LI>The owner and the company form an agreement.
<LI>The surviving owners/company have the option to purchase the deceased's
business
interest.
<LI>If the option is not exercised, the other party is obligated to purchase the
interest.
<LI>Funding the agreement is usually the obligation of the party who has the first
option.
<LI>If necessary, loans between the two can be used to help a party who is
underfunded.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Key Employee Protection: Preserving the Life of Your
Business</STRONG></FONT><P>



<STRONG>Plan Today for the Future</STRONG><BR>
As a business owner, you recognize the importance of insuring your building,
inventory and
equipment.
These assets are vital to the success of your company. But have you considered what
would
happen if
your key employees died unexpectedly
or became disabled?<P>
Key employees are the foundation of a successful business. They are business
owners, sales
directors, CFOs or any other individuals who are sources of leadership,
profitability, and
would be
extremely difficult to replace. Unless the proper steps are taken, the death or
disability of
your key
employees can be devastating to the financial well-being of your company. 
<P>
<STRONG>The Solution: Key Employee Protection</STRONG> <BR>
New York Life can provide you with strategies that will help continue your business
in the
event of a key
employee's death or disability. Funding a plan to protect key employees will give
your
business the
additional funds it needs at a difficult time to:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Hire and train replacements.
<LI>Replace an employee's contribution to profits. 
<LI>Maintain the confidence of clients and creditors.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Funding Options</STRONG><BR>

<STRONG>Option 1: Cash or Sinking Fund</STRONG><BR>
In this option, a business establishes a savings plan, much like a bank account, to
protect
itself from
the death or disability of its key employees. At death, the cash in the savings
plan is used
as a source
of funding. Unfortunately, this method has several drawbacks:<P>
<UL>
<LI>A savings plan accumulates funds over time. What if funds are needed tomorrow?
<LI>A savings plan may be depleted to pay for other expenses.
<LI>Accumulated cash could cause an accumulated earnings problem.
<LI>The business owner(s) will pay dollar for dollar, thus depleting the amount of
cash that
could be used elsewhere.
</UL>

<STRONG>Option 2: Borrowing Funds</STRONG><BR>
In this option, funds are borrowed, usually a bank loan, to replace the financial
loss caused
by a key
employee's death or disability. Drawbacks of this option include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>A potential slow-down in business growth due to additional loan repayments.
<LI>A reduction in future profits may occur because of the loan repayment.
<LI>The business owner(s) will pay dollar for dollar plus interest.
<LI>The company's credit may be adversely affected due to greater debt.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Option 3: Insurance: The Cost Effective Alternative</STRONG><BR>
Purchasing life and/or disability insurance on your key employees is a cost
effective way to
safeguard
your business and minimize the impact of a key employee's death or disability.
It will provide your business with the following advantages:
<P>
<UL>

<LI>Funding with insurance is easy to administer.
<LI>Funding costs pennies on the dollar.
<LI>Funds are available even if death or disability occurs tomorrow.
<LI>Although the premiums are not deductible, the insurance proceeds at death are
generally
received
income tax free to the business.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>SETTING UP THE PLAN</STRONG><BR>
<P>
<center>
<IMG SRC="/nyl/images/pscpep.gif" ALT="Graph"  BORDER="0">
</center>
<p>
The business applies for a life insurance policy on the life of a key employee. The
business
is the
owner and beneficiary of the policy.

	The tradition of conservative management practices and the ability to meet customer need has
built a
company that people can trust with their finances and their futures.  For these, and many more
reasons, New York Life was named one of the most admired companies in America in Fortune
Magazine's 1995 survey.<P>
	New York Life is completely dedicated to maintaining its position as both a leader among
insurance
companies and a major force in the financial services industry.  By staying true to the principles of
prudent expansion, conservative growth, full-service and, above all, a strong field force, New York Life
will maintain and enhance its reputation as "The Company You Keep".

	In considering any career change, many questions may arise, such as:  What will be my
responsibilities?  How will I be trained?  How will I be compensated?  The answers to these questions
depend on many factors.  When you sell insurance or financial services, you're not merely selling
products, you're developing relationships.  Your relationship with your customers, as well as the trust
they place both in you and in the products you offer, are critical components to your ultimate success. 
Agents provide very intimate services in the insurance and financial services marketplace.  They meet
with and know their clients on a personal level.  The responsibilities of an agent include:  contacting
new people, meeting with them and fact-finding to gather necessary information regarding their present
situation, providing analysis of situations and, ultimately, presenting solutions that help meet objectives.

<STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1">New York Life Elects Sy Sternberg as its Next Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1">CEO Harry Hohn to Retire on April 1 
After 40 Years of Service</FONT>
</STRONG><P>

<STRONG>New York,  September 18, 1996</STRONG> - Sy Sternberg has been named chairman and
chief executive officer-elect by the Board of Directors of New York Life Insurance Company, and will take
the helm of the nation's 4th largest life insurer and a leading provider of managed health care and
financial services for individuals and businesses on April 1, 1997. <P>

Sternberg, 53, will succeed Harry G. Hohn, who will be retiring after 40 years with New York Life,
including seven years as its chief executive.  Sternberg, who has been president and chief operating
officer of New York Life since October 1995, also will retain the title of president. <P>

As New York Life's top executive, Sternberg will lead the Company's more than 12,000 employees and
10,000 agents and oversee all of its operations, including individual life and annuity, group life, health
and disability insurance, and financial and investment services for individuals and institutions.  These
operations include NYLCare, the company's fast-growing health benefits subsidiary that provides
managed care services to more than 3.5 million people nationwide, New York Life's life insurance
program offered through the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) and the Company's
MainStay family of mutual funds.	
<P>

"Sy Sternberg's high intelligence, drive, and total knowledge of our business make him the ideal leader
to take New York Life into the next century.  He is a brilliant strategist above all else," said Hohn, 64, who
joined the company as an attorney in 1956 following his graduation from New York University and the
Fordham University School of Law.<P>

"Harry Hohn has transformed New York Life into a truly diversified life insurance company, not to
mention one of the most financially secure companies in America," Sternberg said.  "Under his
leadership, the Company has taken a clear lead in instituting enhanced compliance procedures and a
comprehensive consumer protection program that is already serving as a model for the industry."<P>

Since joining New York Life eight years ago, Sternberg has revitalized the company's group health
insurance operations and spearheaded its highly successful growth strategies in the managed care
arena.  As head of the company's core individual insurance business, Sternberg reaffirmed New York
Life's commitment to agents as the primary marketing channel for the Company's products and
services.<P>

"My job will be to lead the best employees and agents in the business in adding even more luster to New
York Life's already outstanding franchise," Sternberg added. "In my view, no company is better situated
to successfully navigate the wide range of emerging challenges facing our industry, from increased
competition from banks and pending legislative changes in the health care arena, to intense public
scrutiny over the way insurance and other financial products are bought and sold." 	<P>

Before joining New York Life, Sternberg served as senior executive vice president and member of the
board of directors of the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company.  A Brooklyn native, he earned a
B.S. degree from the City College of New York in 1965 and an M.S. degree from Northeastern
University in 1968.  He is also a Chartered Life Underwriter.  Sternberg is a board member of the Health
Insurance Association of America, and serves on its committees on federal programs and health reform
strategies. 
<P>	
 
Mr. Sternberg is the father of two grown daughters, Jodi and Donna, and resides in Purchase, N.Y., with
his wife, Laurie, and their son, Matthew.<P>

New York Life, a Fortune 100 company, is one of the largest financial services companies in the United
States and the world.  New York Life has assets of more than $78 billion and reported total revenues of
$16.7 billion and net income of $625 million in 1995.  Founded in 1845 and headquartered in New York
City, New York Life and its affiliates offer traditional life and group insurance, annuities and managed
health care.  On the investment side, New York Life and its affiliates provide institutional asset
management, trust services, and 401(k) services.  One of its subsidiaries, NYLIFE Distributors Inc., offers
an array of securities products and services, such as institutional and retail mutual funds.

<STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1">New York Life Reaches Out to Young Families with New Insurance
Package</FONT>
</STRONG><P>

<STRONG>New York, August 21, 1996</STRONG> - Recognizing the need to assist growing families
with their insurance requirements, New York Life Insurance Company announced
today a new package of life insurance plans called Spectra Life, which
combines the lower costs of term life insurance with tax deferred cash value
whole life insurance.<P>
        "We recognized that young families often have limited resources but still
require protection," said Mike Gallo, senior vice president of the Company's
Individual Life Department.  "Spectra Life will provide flexible, needed
insurance protection at a reasonable cost to a segment of the population
that studies show is often underinsured."<P>
        Indeed, New York Life believes Spectra Life is the ideal insurance package
for growing families headed by individuals between the ages of 20 and 45
with an income between $30,000 and $75,000 - a market that represents
approximately 14.4 million households in the United States. <A HREF="#1"><SUP><STRONG><FONT
SIZE="-1">1</FONT></STRONG></SUP></A><P>
        <A HREF="psinmm.html">Spectra Life</A> offers growing families three different options of life
insurance protection designed to provide insurance coverage at a premium
cost that can be, in some cases, up to 60 percent less than a traditional
whole life policy.  The options are as follows:<P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Spectra 1 - offers families a 25 percent whole life and 75 percent term
	insurance mix that maintains a level of cost for a five-year period.  In
	addition, customers have the privilege of converting the term insurance
	portion of the coverage into cash value whole life.<P>

	<LI>Spectra 2 - offers families a 50/50 mix of whole life and term life
	insurance that maintains a level cost for a five-year period.  In addition,
	customers have the privilege of converting the term insurance portion of the
	coverage into cash value whole life.<P>

	<LI>Spectra 3 - offers families a 50/50 mix of whole life insurance with a
	Dividend Option Term rider and the Option to Purchase Paid-Up Additions
	rider.  This blend maximizes insurance coverage and eventually replaces the
	term insurance with paid-up additional insurance.<P>
</UL>

        "We believe New York Life's Spectra Life plans will give young families the
ability to purchase insurance when their needs are greatest - at a low
economical cost - and to allow them to increase their coverage as their
needs mature," added Gallo.<P>
        New York Life Insurance Company, a Fortune 100 company, is one of the
largest financial services companies in the United States and the world.
Founded in 1845 and headquartered in New York City, New York Life and its
affiliates offer traditional life and group insurance, annuities, and

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>5 Year Term Insurance</STRONG></FONT>
<P>
5 Year Term (5YT) offers affordable, temporary life insurance protection.  The
premiums are guaranteed and level for the first five years, then increase and are
expected to remain level within each successive five year period, but are not
guaranteed to do so.
<P>
The coverage 5YT provides could help families and business owners safeguard their
financial future.  The proceeds can be used to help pay mortgages and other debts,
fund a child's college education, and help a family continue its standard of
living.
<P>
<STRONG>The Benefits of 5YT</STRONG><BR>
<UL>
<LI>The peace of mind of pure life insurance protection
<LI>A death benefit that is, in most instances, free from federal income tax
<LI>Guaranteed renewable coverage through the expiry age (see"Product Specifics")
<LI> The privilege to convert to a permanent policy that builds cash value (See
"Conversion Privilege")
<LI>The financial strength of New York Life
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>The Uses of 5YT</STRONG><BR>
There are many situations where 5YT may be appropriate.  Here are just a few
examples:
<UL>
<LI>Temporary Need for Protection
<DL>
	<DT>When coverage is needed for a relatively short period of time, 5YT can be
ideal.  A common use is when a mortgage or student loan is taken.
<P>
<LI>Limited Funds
<DT>In situations where life insurance is essential but dollars are scarce, 5YT
could serve as a stop-gap.  Young people starting their careers can choose 5YT,
then convert to a permanent plan as their finances improve.
<P>
<LI>Supplemental Insurance
<DT>5YT can be added as a rider to some permanent plans to help boost the death
benefit.  It's an affordable way to increase total insurance coverage.
<P>
<LI>Provide Family Coverage
<DT>Riders can be added to the policy to insure your spouse and/or children,
guarenteeing their future insurability (see "Riders" section for more information)
<P>
<LI>Protection For Businessowners
<DT>5YT can be used as a hedge to cover outstanding loans, shielding partners or
shareholders from financial hardship.

policyowners'

virtually every

Starting modestly with assets of $17,000 in 1845, the Company has grown to over 
$74 billion in consolidated assets, with over $449 billion of life insurance in
force.<FONT

<UL>Susan B. Anthony, the 19th-century American social reformer, believed
strongly that if
women were to achieve political equality, they had to be financially
independent.  She was
one of the first women to own an insurance policy, and her insurer was New York
Life.</UL><P>

<EM>1896 - New York Life becomes the <STRONG>first</STRONG> company to
insure
people with
physical impairments or hazardous occupations</EM><BR>

<UL>Using a scientific basis to evaluate people with substandard risks, New
York Life was
able to issue policies to people previously considered uninsurable.  This
innovation --
praised by experts at the time as the single greatest advancement in life
insurance -- 
enabled millions of people (who in the past would have been declined) to qualify
for life
insurance and protect their families' financial future.</UL> <P>

<STRONG>Adding Value and Flexibility to Life Insurance</STRONG><BR>

<EM>1860 - New York Life becomes the <STRONG>first</STRONG> company to issue
policies
containing a "non-forfeiture option"</EM><BR>

<UL>Before any state law required it, New York Life developed the
non-forfeiture option,
which formed the foundation of guaranteed cash values found in policies today. 
This feature
enables a policy to remain in force even when a premium payment is
inadvertently missed. 
Today, policyowners have various ways to apply cash values to prevent their
policies from
lapsing.  Typically, the options include automatic premium loan, extended term
insurance, and
reduced paid-up insurance.</UL><P>

<EM>1892 - New York Life becomes the <STRONG>first</STRONG> major company to
issue policies
with an incontestable clause</EM>

<UL>To give policyowners even more peace of mind, New York Life sets a time
limit on the
insurer's right to dispute a policy's validity based on material misstatements
made in the
application.</UL><P>

<EM>1920 - New York Life becomes the <STRONG>first</STRONG> company to issue
a
policy with a
disability benefit that presumes  total disability to be permanent after a
predetermined
number of months</EM><BR>

<UL>New York Life has long been a leader in liberal insurance concepts.  The
Company provides
a benefit that waives premiums when the insured is disabled for a predetermined
period of
time.</UL><P>

<EM>1948 - New York Life becomes the <STRONG>first</STRONG> non-industrial
company to offer
family insurance</EM><BR>

<UL>The Company helps families by introducing a family insurance plan offering
coverage on
all members of a family under one policy.</UL><P>

<EM>1956 - New York Life becomes the <STRONG>first</STRONG> company to offer
the convenience
of Check-O-Matic premium payments</EM><BR>

<UL>This innovation relieves policyowners of the burdensome task of writing a
check to make
premium payments.  Policyowners can now authorize New York Life to draw funds
directly from
their bank accounts to pay premiums each month.</UL><P>


<EM>1992 - New York Life becomes the <STRONG>first</STRONG> major insurer to
offer policies
with an Unemployment Rider</EM><BR>

<UL>To help aid policyowners through hard times, this no-cost rider offers to
waive premiums
if policyowners become unemployed for a predetermined period of time. 
Earlier, the Company
introduced the Living Benefits Rider.  Should an insured become terminally ill,
this rider
provides for a benefit payment that can be used to pay medical expenses during
this
difficult time.</UL><P>

<STRONG>Our Focus on Quality Service</STRONG><BR>

<EM>1892 - New York Life becomes the <STRONG>first</STRONG> insurer to
organize
a Branch
Office System</EM>

<UL>To provide the highest possible level of service to our expanding customer
base, the
Company established an integrated network of General Offices across the
country.  Today, these
"G.O.s" serve our nearly 11,000 agents.  We believe this highly trained
team of
dedicated professionals is our most valuable asset.  Our agents have been
honored by the
industry for outstanding service to their clients, and New York Life has
consistently led the
industry in membership in the Million Dollar Round Table, an organization
devoted to promoting
 exemplary ethical standards of the insurance industry.</UL><P>


<EM>1989 - New York Life becomes the <STRONG>first</STRONG> insurer to require
continuing
education for its agents</EM>

<UL>To provide agents with the knowledge they require to keep pace with the
rapidly changing
financial services marketplace, the Company launched NYLIC University in
January 1995.  This
program is designed to give uniform, comprehensive training to both new and
established
agents. In addition, many agents have successfully met stringent academic
standards, earning
prestigious professional designations such as CLU, ChFC, and MSFS.</UL><P>


<EM>1990 - New York Life becomes the <STRONG>first</STRONG> major insurance
company to offer
whole life policyowners an "Owner's Manual"</EM>

<UL>New York Life has always sought to educate the public about the workings
and various
benefits of life insurance.  Beginning in 1895 with the introduction of the
"Golden Policy,"
all of our policies have been written in concise, plain language, not
"insurance-ese."  The
Whole Life "Owner's Manual," an easy-to-read guidebook available to our
policyowners, 
continues this tradition.  Through its newsletters, <EM>intouch</EM> and
<EM>inbusiness</EM>, as
well as the
in-depth discussions in the <EM>Concept Papers</EM> series, New York Life seeks to
provide its
customers with timely information regarding life insurance and financial
issues.</UL>

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>A Game Plan For Meeting College Costs</STRONG></FONT><P>

Sending children to college can be a major financial burden for many parents.  Establishing a
sound
financial plan can be a key to easing that burden and allow your children the education they
deserve.
<P>
<STRONG>Putting a Foundation Beneath Your Children's Dreams</STRONG><BR>
All parents have big dreams for their children. They hope one day they'll grow up to become
someone
truly great - the President of the U.S., a doctor who finds a miracle cure, a concert
pianist. These
dreams can be obtained with the help of a college education. 
<P>
<STRONG>How Much Does College Cost?</STRONG><BR>
Most people look back on their college years with great fondness - and many look ahead to
their
children's education with some anxiety. With costs so high, how can I afford to send my kids
to college?
According to 1995-1996 College Board statistics, a college education currently averages about
$37,000 for a four-year degree at a public college, and over $79,000 at a four-year private
school.
Looking at the Ivy League? Four years of tuition, fees, room and board now costs about
$100,000 at
elite schools such as Harvard and Yale. And costs keep rising. The College Board says that
the
average annual increase in tuition at private universities during the 1980s was about 11%.
These
numbers can strike fear into the hearts of parents of college-bound children. Sure, the ever
rising costs
of college can be a challenge, but it is one that can be met. Early preparation can help make
it easier
for everyone concerned. 
<P>
<STRONG>How Much Will You Need To Save?</STRONG><BR>
If your child is age 1:<BR>
It will take a $434 invested each month for 17 years to pay for a college education at a
private
university.	
<P>
If your child is age 10:<BR>
It will take a $876 invested each month for 8 years to pay for a college education at a
private
university.<P>

<P>
<STRONG>Here Are Some Tips on Getting a Handle on College Funding:</STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<STRONG>Pre-Pay Tuition</STRONG> - Some state universities have set up innovative programs
where college expenses
may be paid in installments over many years, prior to attending the school. This may be a
convenient
way to meet expenses, but it takes the choice of school away from your child. What if your
child does
not
want to attend the state university? This could pose a problem.
<P>
<STRONG>Borrowing</STRONG> - These days, most people borrow at least a portion of the money
needed to cover college
expenses. You may want your children to look for student loans with special lower rates and
repayment
terms for college. However, repaying a large loan 
for many years after graduation can be a burden for some recent graduates. Tapping into your
401(k)
plan may be an option, but you may want to take a loan rather than a withdrawal to avoid tax
consequences. Of course, a loan will impede the potential growth of your retirement nest egg.
<P>
<STRONG>Financial Aid</STRONG> - There are billions of dollars available each year in
scholarships, grants, and work study
programs. Financial aid to middle income families may be tough to come by, but with the
shrunken
college age population, some student-hungry universities are more willing to offer generous
financial
aid packages. It's certainly worth contacting your child's high school and prospective
college financial
aid office to see if you're eligible.
<P>
<STRONG>The Team Approach</STRONG> - With the seemingly overwhelming cost, it may be most
practical to finance
school through many sources such as your personal savings, student loans, financial aid, even a
part-time job
for your child. Once in school, your child might want to look into paid internships that
provide valuable
experience and help pay the bills. Every bit will help, but the bulk may still have to come
from money
you
put away over the years - so it's essential to make the most of your savings and investments.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>The Key to College Funding</STRONG><BR>
Start saving now! There's no better time than the present to begin accumulating funds for
future college
costs. Below are some tips:
<P>
<UL>
<STRONG>Put time on your side</STRONG> - If your children are young, or you don't have
children
yet, you can put the power
of time to work for you. The sooner you start, the better, letting the wonder of compound
interest help
build a nice college fund. <P>
<STRONG>Pay yourself first</STRONG> - Systematically set aside a fixed amount at a regular
interval
that you can comfortably
afford. You may be able to have this done automatically through bank drafting and payroll
deduction.
Speak to your financial institution and payroll department to set up these convenient savings
methods.
<P>
<STRONG>Use tax advantages</STRONG> - You can try to maximize earnings and minimize taxes
through several
tax-advantaged strategies. Investing in tax-free municipal bonds or bond funds, setting up a
trust, and
making a gift under the Uniform Gift to Minors Act are three ways to possibly lower the tax
bite. Consult
your tax advisor and attorney regarding these approaches.
<P>
<STRONG>Don't put all your eggs in one basket</STRONG> - Diversification is a key to reducing
potential risk. Dividing your
money among different financial vehicles may help protect against loss and increase the
potential for
competitive returns. If your children are still in diapers and you have a long time horizon,
you may want
to consider financial products that may offer the potential for greater returns to complement
traditional
bank products.
<P>
<STRONG>The Financial Vehicles to Take Your Kids to College</STRONG><BR>
Before your child asks you for a spiffy new sports car to take to school, you may want to
take a look at
some financial vehicles. Permanent life insurance products, such as whole life and universal
life, offer
cash value accumulation in addition to their essential financial protection. Over the long
term, the cash
value accumulation may be significant enough to help fund a portion of college expenses.
Annuities
may also be an option. There are a variety of annuities designed to help build your nest egg.
Some
products offer the convenience of automatic bank drafting - making systematic monthly premium
payments easy (withdrawals from annuities prior to age <NOBR>59 1/2</NOBR> may be subject to
a
10% IRS penalty
tax).

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Annuity Considerations</STRONG></FONT><P>

Do you have money to invest as a result of any of these situations:<P>
<UL>
<LI>A lump sum distribution from a pension plan?
<LI>An inheritance?
<LI>The sale of a home or business?
<LI>A CD or money market account that is no longer generating competitive yields?
<LI>Extra liquidity now that your children are grown?
</UL>

If any of these situations apply and your goal is long term savings, an annuity may be an
appropriate part of your portfolio.  There are four very different types of annuities which
fall into the categories of deferred annuities and immediate annuities.

<STRONG>Simplified Employee Pension Plan Ideas From The Company You Keep</STRONG>
<BR>

Owners of small businesses agree that a retirement plan can do a lot for a growing company.
Finding
one with features that your business needs, such as tax advantages, low cost, and minimal
paperwork,
can be challenging. Look no further than a Simplified Employee Pension plan (SEP).<P>
A SEP plan is an easy way to make contributions toward your
employees' retirement income - and your own.<P>
Through a SEP, you take a tax deduction for contributions you make directly to your
employees' IRAs.
Meanwhile, these contributions are excluded from employees' gross incomes. Since employees
handle their own IRAs, you pay benefits directly into their accounts instead of operating a
pension plan
of your own. Your contributions are also completely discretionary, and you can change them
from year to
year. 
<P>
Even if you've missed the year-end deadline that applies to most qualified plans, you can
still establish
a SEP for last year - and get the tax deduction.<P>
Thanks to the tax deductibility of contributions, the net cost of installing and running a
SEP can be zero
or may even create a positive cash flow for many business owners. 
<P>
<STRONG>The Simplified Employee Pension Plan (SEP): Tax-Free, Form-Free, Hassle-Free...Completely Stress-Free </STRONG><BR>
You may find a SEP most attractive for what it doesn't have:<P>
<UL>
<LI><EM>No</EM> annual IRS or Department of Labor filings;
<LI><EM>No</EM> funding until your company's tax filing date;
<LI><EM>No</EM> income taxes on contributions;
<LI><EM>No</EM> required contributions from year to year;
<LI><EM>No</EM> complicated plan documentation;
<LI><EM>No</EM> complex record keeping or expensive administration.
</UL>
<P>
A SEP means no longer trying to accommodate an expensive, labor-intensive pension plan designed 
for a large company. A SEP is a cost-effective and flexible program, packed with employee
advantages
and the flexibility a small company needs. You can:<P>

<UL>
<LI><EM>Choose</EM> from a wide variety of investment options;
<LI><EM>Offer</EM> a companion plan (a Salary Reduction SEP [SARSEP]) that enables employees
to make
pre-tax contributions, just like a 401(k);
<LI><EM>Design</EM> eligibility criteria that make the most sense for your company.
</UL>

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Are There Any Risks With Annuities?</STRONG></FONT><P>

	As with any investment, there are some risks that you should be aware of. 
With a
fixed
annuity, since the insurance company is guaranteeing the value of the annuity, you
must
make
sure that the company is backing its promise with sound investments.  If you select
a well
managed and highly rated company, you will have a secure investment that offers
attractive
rates of return.<P>
	Since there are so many types of annuities, selecting the proper type can be
very
confusing.  Should it be fixed or variable?  The answer depends on your own
situation.<P>
	As your personal goals and financial situation change, your financial plan
must
also
change.  Your New York Life agent and/or  NYLIFE Securities registered
representative
are there to help you identify those financial products that can help you meet your
goal.

The markets performed exceptionally in 1995, and Asset Management (including related subsidiaries)
took full advantage, turning in sales of $7.8 billion.  The Stable Value Group and the MainStay Family of
Funds, the largest contributors to our sales results, both had record years.  Stable Value reached $3.9
billion in sales and maintained its position during the year as the leading distributor of traditional
Guaranteed Investment Contracts (GICs) to retirement plans.  Going forward, Stable Value intends to
continue its leadership role while delving into new market opportunities with alternative GIC
products.<P>
	With Stable Value providing the foundation, the MainStay Funds represent growth opportunity for
our
operation.  MainStay closed out the year with strong investment results and the best sales year in the
history of the funds.  MacKay Shields Financial Corporation, our largest money management
subsidiary, was a key to MainStay's success, with outstanding equity performance in 1995.  MainStay
also developed relationships with major brokerages, accounting for half of all new account sales in
1995.  In addition, a coordinated brand awareness campaign for MainStay, complete with television and
print advertisements, was a meaningful contributor to MainStay's results.  Past performance is no guarantee or indication of future results.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>CD vs. Deferred Annuity</STRONG></FONT><P>



<STRONG>Which Best Meets Your Needs?</STRONG><BR>
They're both quality financial tools. If you're debating whether the best place for
your
money is a
certificate of deposit (CD) or deferred annuity, the answer depends upon your
individual
financial
situation and investment objectives.
<P>
Both CDs and deferred annuities are savings vehicles used by individuals to
accumulate
wealth.
However, these two products are quite different; each has its own unique strengths
and uses.
For the
sake of comparison, let's look at two similar versions of these products - an
individually
owned,
non-tax qualified bank CD and an individually owned, non-tax qualified single
premium
deferred annuity
earning an annually renewable fixed rate of return. Review the list of objectives
and
identify those which
are most important to you. This will help determine which of these two products -
CD or
deferred
annuity - is best suited for your needs at this time.
<P>
<STRONG>Objectives</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>Safety of Principal:</STRONG> Both CDs and deferred annuities are
considered low-risk
investments. CDs are
generally issued by banks and, in most cases, are insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) for up to $100,000 per depositor. Should the bank fail, the
FDIC
guarantees CDs up
to this amount.<P>
Deferred annuities, on the other hand, are issued by insurance companies and are
not insured
by the
U.S. government. They are backed in their entirety by the financial strength of the
issuing
insurance
company, regardless of the amount. Before purchasing an annuity however, you should
make sure
the
issuing insurance company is financially sound. You can determine financial
stability by
requesting the
findings of independent rating companies such as Moody's, A.M. Best, Standard &amp;
Poor's and
Duff &amp; Phelps.
<P>
<STRONG>Short-Term Accumulation: </STRONG>When deciding between a CD and a
deferred
annuity, your investment
horizon should be a key factor. Your investment horizon is the amount of time you
need to
save for a
specific goal. For short-term goals, such as a down payment on a home, a new car or
a
vacation, a CD
may prove to be a better choice for you. In most instances, you can select a
maturity date
for your CD
that corresponds to your time horizon. Maturity periods can be as short as one
month or as
long as
several years. 
<P>
<STRONG>Long-Term Accumulation:</STRONG> On the other hand, a deferred annuity is
generally
the product of choice for
the long haul. Deferred annuities are designed to help accumulate money for
retirement or to
protect
funds already saved up once you've reached retirement. They can even be used to
provide a
legacy for
your heirs. In later years, a deferred annuity also provides more flexibility for
accessing
your money.
<P>
<STRONG>Interest Return:</STRONG> CDs offer a guaranteed rate of return for a
specified
period of
time. Interest rates will
vary depending on current market conditions and the length of time to maturity.
Generally,
the shorter
the period of time to maturity, the lower the rate. There is no guaranteed minimum
for
renewal rates.
With a deferred annuity, a guaranteed interest rate is locked in for an initial
period,
usually one to three
years. After that, interest rates may be adjusted periodically, generally each
year. Because
annuities are
long-term vehicles, their interest rates tend to be higher than comparable CDs.<P>
Deferred annuities also offer a guaranteed minimum interest rate. Regardless of
market
conditions, the
annuity will pay at least the minimum guaranteed rate established at the time of
purchase. In
addition,
some companies offer a "bailout" rate to protect against excessive year-to-year
rate
fluctuations. 
<P>
<STRONG>Tax Savings:</STRONG> If taxes are a concern, a deferred annuity may be a
better
option
for several reasons:
<P>
Earnings on CDs are taxable in the year the interest is earned even if you don't
take the
money out. With
deferred annuities, on the other hand, earnings accumulate free of current
taxation. Earnings
inside an
annuity are not treated as taxable income until they are withdrawn. This allows
more of your
money to
work harder towards achieving your long-term goals and gives you a measure of
control over
when you
pay taxes and how much you pay. This tax deferral feature is one of the greatest
advantages
of deferred
annuities.
<P>
As you can see from the chart below, when saving for the long term it makes good
investment
sense to
have the power of tax deferral on your side. Keep in mind that withdrawals from the
earnings
portion of a
deferred annuity are taxable and, if you're under age 59 1/2, these earnings may be
subject
to a 10% tax
penalty. 
<P>

<FONT SIZE="-1">*Hypothetical rate used for illustrative purposes only.  Not intended to predict

and/or charges.</FONT><BR>

<P>
Deferred annuities may also help reduce or eliminate the taxes on your Social
Security
benefits. By
leaving your money in a deferred annuity you can reduce your taxable income,
keeping it below
the level
where you would begin to owe taxes on your Social Security benefits. But with CDs,
your
interest
earnings count in the calculation to determine how much of your Social Security
benefits will
be taxed -
even if you don't withdraw the earnings. As much as 85% of your Social Security
benefits
could end up
subject to taxation.
<P>
At death, the annuity's account value will be paid directly to your named
beneficiary(ies),
avoiding the
costs and delays associated with the probate process. This is not the case with a
CD, which
is
included in your estate. When purchasing a deferred annuity, look for one that
distributes
the full
account value to beneficiaries. Some companies apply surrender charges on death
benefit
proceeds.
<P>
<STRONG>Liquidity:</STRONG> If you need access to the funds in a CD prior to the
maturity
date, you
may pay an interest
penalty ranging from 30 days' to six months' interest. Of course, you can limit
your exposure
to
surrender penalties by investing in several CDs with staggered maturity dates.<BR>
A deferred annuity also provides you with access to funds should the need arise.
Most
companies will
give you the flexibility to withdraw a portion of your deferred annuity's account
value,
usually 10% each
year, without a company-imposed surrender charge. Withdrawals from deferred
annuities can be
made
in response to a one time cash need or set up systematically to respond to a
continuous need.
In fact,
most deferred annuities offer the opportunity to systematically withdraw funds on a
monthly,
quarterly,
semi-annual or annual basis.<P>
Keep in  mind that deferred annuities are designed to build your retirement nest
egg.
Withdrawals of
earnings prior to age 59 1/2 may be subject to a 10% penalty tax. Plus, most
insurers assess
a
surrender charge if the contract is terminated during the firs

Nonprofit organizations perform many vital functions in communities across the
country.  It's
important that the
future
financial strength of these nonprofit organizations is secure.  They face the
dilemma of
increased demand
for services in the wake of reduced government support and overflowing operational
costs.
<P>
New York Life offers hope.  Charitable Adjustable Life (CAL), a specially designed
life
insurance plan,
underwritten by New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation (NYLIAC), can  help
secure
endowment funds for the future. 
<P>
<STRONG>Charitable Adjustable Life is Here to Help</STRONG><BR>

CAL can help ensure the well-being of individual nonprofit organizations  by
creating a pool
of monies
for future
efforts.  CAL is a simple permanent life insurance policy with competitive interest
crediting. 
As the
owner and beneficiary of the policy, individual nonprofit organizations have access
to any
cash values that
accrue - a
real plus if they need liquidity.  CAL makes it possible to plan now for a bright
future.  
<P>
<STRONG>CAL - The Best of Both Worlds</STRONG><BR>

In the past, it was common to rely heavily on a handful of wealthy donors.  Because
CAL is
affordable,
those limited to making smaller donations may now be able to fund sizable gifts for
tomorrow.  CAL
need not interfere with present solicitation efforts - it's meant to supplement,
not replace,
current
donations.  

Donors to a nonprofit organization that participates will also find CAL attractive.
Since
donors can fund CAL from current income,
rather than
accumulated wealth, they don't have to utilize assets that were intended for their
families. 
Of course,
they may also be able to take any applicable tax deductions when itemizing their
tax returns. 
Gifts are
easy to arrange and are outside of the probate estate.   
<P>
<STRONG>We're Here to Support Nonprofit Organizations</STRONG><BR>

CAL is simple, effective and makes perfect sense for nonprofit organizations.  New
York
Life's
outstanding
reputation for customer service makes establishing a CAL arrangement easy.  After
a nonprofit organization has secured a
group of interested donors, the donors  fill out a simple medical form, and a New
York Life
representative  provides a letter of intent to the organization.  When the
organization
receives all premiums/donations,
they simply send a
check for the total amount to New York Life.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Choosing the Right Insurance Mix</STRONG></FONT><P>


Should you purchase term insurance, or is permanent insurance the better buy?  If you
already own a
term policy, should you convert it to a permanent plan, such as whole life?  Or is a flexible
plan, such as
universal life, the way to go?<P>
	There are no easy answers to these questions.  And that is not because the
three kinds of
insurance are so complex and difficult to understand - actually, the differences between them
are basic
and easily comprehensible.  What makes these questions difficult
is that the
answers depend on you, your budget, and your needs.  One kind of insurance is not
necessarily
"better" than the other; and they are certainly not mutually exclusive.  More than likely, your
choice will
not
be "either/or" but "the best mix."<P>
<STRONG>Term, Whole Life, Universal</STRONG><BR>
	Term insurance provides economic protection for a specified period (or "term") at a
specified rate. 
It
is "no frills" coverage that is very inexpensive at younger ages and becomes increasingly
more
expensive as you get older.  Its "premium" (what you're required to pay to keep the policy in
force)
increases each term (since you can also buy this kind of insurance for periods of one,
five, or even
ten years).  It is designed to lock-in insurability for conversion to permanent insurance in the
future.<P>
	Permanent insurance, on the other hand, provides permanent protection, coverage for
your whole
life.  "Whole life" insurance offers a level or fixed premium that is guaranteed never to go up,
because it
averages insurance costs over your lifetime.  In the early years, therefore, premiums are
higher than the
amount required to pay only for pure death benefit protection.<P>
	If it were that simple, the choice between term and permanent insurance would be
straightforward: 
Whatever your age, buy the cheaper product.  However, the premium you pay in the early
years of a
whole life policy helps build a guaranteed tax-deferred "cash value," which is available
during your
lifetime, in the form of policy loans that can be used to meet emergencies, fund education
expenses, or
provide income for retirement.  Moreover, whole life policies from mutual insurance
companies are
generally "participating," which means that they earn dividends.<P>
	What about universal life?  Like whole life, this kind of insurance is permanent, offering
lifetime
protection and cash value accumulation.  Unlike whole life, however, universal-type policies
feature an
adjustable death benefit and flexible premiums.  After making an initial minimum premium
payment,
policy owners may pay whatever they desire, subject to IRS and company
minimum/maximum rules;
they may even skip premium payments for a year or longer.  The policy's death benefit may
fluctuate
accordingly.  With a universal policy, you have added flexibility to adjust your death benefit
and premium
payments according to your current needs.
<P>
<STRONG>Which is Best for You?</STRONG><BR>
	Term insurance is normally the better buy for the younger age groups and for the short
run.  It
makes
the ideal choice when you're young, just starting out, and on a strict budget, since it allows
you to buy
the full amount of coverage you need at an affordable price.  After all, there is no point to
buying a
permanent policy if you simply can't afford it; you'll either buy less coverage than you need
or, even
worse, lose your money as well as your coverage if you allow the policy to lapse because of
nonpayment.<P>
	Term insurance is perfect when your needs are temporary and when you need
protection until a
debt,
such as a mortgage or a business or education loan is paid off.  Generally speaking, if your
need for
protection lasts ten years or less, or will cease entirely before age 50, term insurance is an
intelligent
buy.  If you don't need protection after a certain point in your life, for instance once<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>the children have left home,
	<LI>your spouse is self-supporting,
	<LI>Additional income is not needed for retirement years, or
	<LI>you have no desire to leave an inheritance or need to protect an estate or
business, term
insurance is right for you.
</UL>
<P>
	However, if you need insurance for an extended period - for ten or more years - and if
you do have
the
kinds of needs listed above, you should consider permanent plans, such as whole life and
universal
life.
<P>
<STRONG>Some Things to Consider</STRONG><BR>
	"Baby Boomers" who are having children in their thirties and forties are often financing
a mortgage,
paying and saving for the education of their children, building a retirement nest egg, and
perhaps even
helping to fund long-term care for their parents.  They are the first generation of Americans to
be
handling these responsibilities simultaneously.  Permanent insurance provides not only
necessary
economic protection, but also the kind of asset accumulation opportunity they need to meet
converging
demands.  Over time, it is much more cost-efficient than term insurance.<P>
	After the age of fifty, permanent insurance is almost certainly the better buy, since term
premiums
increase considerably thereafter and are not recoverable in the form of cash value or
dividends. 
Permanent insurance, however, allows you to leave your options open with respect to
economic
protection, retirement and education funding, and estate planning.  It can be used to boost
monthly
retirement income through a technique known as "pension maximization."  It can also be a
major estate
planning tool, enabling you to minimize estate taxes and provide liquidity for your heirs.<P>
	What about the retirement years?  The cash value in a permanent policy can be used to
supplement
Social Security, pension benefits, and investment income.  You can borrow from it or even
turn it into an
annuity generating monthly income for life.
<P>
<STRONG>Choosing the Best Mix</STRONG><BR>
	What if you're sold on the value of permanent insurance but can't afford all the
coverage you need? 
You have some options.  You can buy the term insurance you need and gradually convert it,
piece by
piece, into permanent insurance.  (Most term policies have a "conversion" privilege that
allows you to
turn your term insurance into permanent insurance without proving good health.)  Let's say
you need
$200,000 worth of insurance: you can buy a term policy for that amount and later convert
$50,000 of it
into a permanent plan, keeping the rest of the term in force to convert in the future.  Whether
you choose
to convert to whole life or universal life will depend on your specific needs for an adjustable
death
benefit and flexible premium payments.<P>
	Another option is to buy a permanent plan with term insurance added to it.  If, again,
you need
$200,000 of insurance but can only afford to pay for little more than $100,000 of permanent
coverage,
you may be able to buy a base plan with $100,000 of cash value insurance and, for only a
little more
money, a $100,000 "term rider."  Or, you might buy a $200,000 universal life policy, starting
off with the
minimum premium and gradually increasing those payments as circumstances allow.<P>
	When all is said and done, you needn't be thinking in terms of "term versus
permanent."  Rather,
you
should be thinking of what is the best mix of term and permanent insurance that will meet
your needs. 
With the help of your New York Life agent, you can design an insurance plan that is flexible
and
affordable - a customized plan that will meet your needs and help you reach your goals.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Deferred Annuities</STRONG></FONT><P>

	Deferred annuities are the most popular.  They allow people to accumulate money
without
paying current income tax on their earnings.  This means that the amount can grow faster,
due
to the tremendous power of compound interest.<P>
	For example, if you have $10,000 to invest in a deferred annuity that is earning 5% a
year, at the end of the first year your annuity will be worth $10,500.  That full amount will
be available to earn interest the following year.  If, instead, you invest in a currently
taxable investment that is also earning 5%, and your marginal tax rate is 28%, at the end
of
the year only $10,360 will be available for reinvestment.  The remaining $140 will be paid to
the government for income tax on the $500 you earn.  This may seem like a small sum of
money,
but if this continues for ten years, the difference between the values of the tax-deferred
annuity and the currently taxable investment will be $2,046!  (Of course, taxes must still be
paid when the earnings inside the annuity contract are distributed.  If the annuity were
cashed in after ten years, the income tax would be $1,761, assuming a 28% rate and no
penalty
taxes).<P>
	There are two types of deferred annuities - fixed and variable.  Fixed annuities pay a
fixed rate of interest similar to CDs.  Unlike annuities, CDs are FDIC insured.  Variable annuities offer the choice of several
investment divisions such as stocks, bonds, and money market funds, which can cause the
rate of
return to fluctuate with market conditions.

<STRONG>A Time-Tested, Disciplined Approach To Sound Investing</STRONG>
<P>

If you are looking for an investment strategy that offers simplicity, with a
long-term
approach, this
technique may be right for you.<P>
Choosing an investment strategy that suits you is never easy. You face a myriad of
tough
questions,
including:<P>
<UL>
<LI>How much money should I invest?
<LI>How often should I invest? 
<LI>Where should I invest my money? 
</UL>
<P>
Fortunately, there's a venerable investment strategy that could be the answer to
many of your
concerns.
It's called Dollar Cost Averaging, and it can simplify your investment planning.
<P>

The name may sound complicated but, simply put, Dollar Cost Averaging is nothing
more than
the
systematic investment of a fixed dollar amount at regular time intervals. For
example, you
could invest
$100 every week. Or $500 every month. Or $1,000 every three months. The amount
and
frequency
of
your investments depends upon your financial means and long-term goals. However,
once you
initiate
the plan, the key to success is sticking with it and ignoring market fluctuations.
<P>
<STRONG>How Does Dollar Cost Averaging Work?</STRONG><BR>
Basically, Dollar Cost Averaging attempts to take the ups and downs of the market
and "smooth
them
out." Instead of trying to time the highs and lows (a daunting task, even for
professionals),
you're
investing the same amount of money at regular intervals. Dollar Cost Averaging
encourages a
systematic approach to investing that frees you from trying to time the market.
Let's take a
look at how a
Dollar Cost Averaging program would work under three hypothetical market
environments:
fluctuating,
rising, and declining.
<P>
<STRONG>Dollar Cost Averaging in Turbulent Times</STRONG><BR>
Let's assume you decide to put $100 every month in an investment that is currently
selling
for $10 per
share. (For this hypothetical example, let's assume that there are no additional
charges).
The first
month you invest $100 and receive 10 shares. Then, in an extreme but easy to
follow
example,
the
market falls and the price drops to $5 per share. In the second month your $100
buys you 20
shares.
The market rebounds in the following month, the price jumps to $10 per share, and
for your
$100
investment you receive 10 shares. Let's see where you would stand:

Average Share Cost To You: $7.50 ($300&#247;40)<BR>
Average Share Price Over 3 Months: $8.33 ($25&#247;3)

As you can see, you now own 40 shares after a total investment of $300. The
average
price is
$8.33,
but the average cost to you was $7.50. Being disciplined and remaining with the
program is
the key to
the long-term success of Dollar Cost Averaging. 
<P>
<STRONG>In Good Times...</STRONG><BR>
Let's say you continue with your investment program, and the market rallies. Your
investment
rises to
$20, then $25, and eventually $50 per share. Let's see where you stand.<P>

Average Share Cost To You: $27.27 ($300&#247;411)<BR>
Average Share Price Over 3 Months: $31.67 ($95&#247;3)
<P>
When the market rises, you benefit in two ways: the value of your total investment
increases
(obviously),
and the average cost you paid is lower than the average share price (not so
obvious, but
true). When
you compare the average share price ($31.67) to what you actually paid ($27.27),
you can
appreciate
the benefits of Dollar Cost Averaging.
<P>
<STRONG>...And In Bad</STRONG><BR>
It's tough to find a silver lining in the dark cloud of a declining market, but
through the
consistency of
Dollar Cost Averaging, you can take some consolation. Let's assume the market
begins to slide
and
the price drops to $25, then $20 and eventually $10 per share.

Average Share Cost To You: $15.79 ($300&#247;19)<BR>
Average Share Price Over 3 Months: $18.33 ($55&#247;3)
<P>
Here, when the share price fell from $25 to $10 you were able to purchase the
greatest number
of
shares. In addition, your average share cost ($15.79) was less than the average
share price.
Because
you invested a fixed dollar amount at regular intervals, ignoring the price
fluctuations, you
were able to
purchase a larger number of shares when the price was low and  a smaller number of
shares
when
the price was high. In effect, you are buying a lot at bargain prices, and
relatively little
at what might be
considered exorbitantly high prices.
<P>
<STRONG>No Guarantees in Life</STRONG><BR>
As illustrated in the "declining market" example, Dollar Cost Averaging does not
guarantee a
profit nor
protect against loss. If you have to "sell low," no system is going to give you a
gain. It's
every investors
dream to "beat the market," but unfortunately there are no magic methods that can
guarantee
that.
However, a Dollar Cost Averaging plan can offer a disciplined, systematic approach
to
investing, that
could be the cornerstone of your long-term planning. Since such plans involve
continuous
investment in
securities regardless of fluctuating price levels, you should consider your
financial ability
to continue
making purchases during periods of low price levels.
<P>
<STRONG>Setting Up a Dollar Cost Averaging Plan</STRONG><BR>
While Dollar Cost Averaging may simplify the questions "How much?" and "How often?"
you
should
invest, before you can enjoy the benefits of this program you must first answer the
question,
"Where
should I invest?" Investing in variable products is a popular way to utilize Dollar
Cost
Averaging.
Vehicles such as mutual funds, variable annuities, and variable universal life
insurance
offer
investment flexibility and convenience. You can set up a customized program where
you invest
a fixed
amount at regular time intervals into a variable product. Your regular investments
can be
made by
simply writing checks, or you can take advantage of the convenience of bank
drafting. With
this method,
automatic payments are withdrawn from your bank savings or checking account to
purchase
shares on
a regular basis.

<STRONG>Life Insurance Protection For You and Your Family</STRONG><BR>
New York Life, in cooperation with thousands of employers across the country, offers a
program that assists employees in providing protection and
financial security
for themselves and their families. This program allows employees of participating companies
to
purchase individual universal
life insurance
coverage through voluntary payroll deduction<STRONG><SUP>1</SUP></STRONG>.  Here are just a
few of the important
features offered:

<P>
<STRONG><SUP>1</SUP></STRONG> Participation in the payroll
deduction life
insurance program
is completely voluntary. Since this program is not intended to be subject to the
Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), participating employers cannot contribute to or endorse
any policy offered
under this program.

<P>
<STRONG>Competitive Rates</STRONG> - This policy is available to employees of participating
companies.
Through payroll deduction, we are able to offer rates that are competitive.
<P>
<STRONG>Flexibility</STRONG> - With universal life employees can adapt their plan to
accommodate their
changing needs
throughout the years. For instance,
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Premiums can be adjusted to satisfy an employee's changing needs and/or new budget.
<LI>The policy provides an increasing cash value, which may be used for
emergencies, retirement,
college education, or other financial needs.
<LI>Employees also have the option to increase or decrease the policy death benefit or
cash accumulation
value without purchasing an additional policy.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Easy Participation</STRONG> - Completion of a short, simple application is
usually all
that's needed. Physical
exams are usually not necessary.<P>
<STRONG>Control &amp; Portability</STRONG> - Individual employees own their policy, so they
can
tailor it to
meet their own
needs. Should employees leave
their present employer for any reason, they can continue their policy without any
change in premiums or
 benefits.<P>
<STRONG>Convenient Payments</STRONG> - There are no checks for employees to write, and
nothing for
them to mail. Premiums
are deducted from their paychecks before they receive them. <P>
<STRONG>Optional Family Coverage</STRONG> - An employee's spouse, children, and even
grandchildren
may be able to obtain high
quality insurance protection - even if the employee doesn't participate.<P>

<STRONG>Common Questions</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>Who is Eligible for a Policy?</STRONG><BR>
All full-time employees (30+ hrs/wk) of participating companies, ages 16-65, who have been
working
at least
six months may
apply for coverage.
<P>
<STRONG>Does This Replace Other Employer-Provided Group Life
Insurance?</STRONG><BR>
No, this individual life insurance supplements any existing insurance that employees may
have. Unlike many
group life insurance programs, it isn't reduced or eliminated when employees retire or
leave the company.
<P>
<STRONG>When Does the Insurance Begin?</STRONG><BR>
Immediately. Once an employee signs the application and the Payroll Deduction Authorization
form, insurance is
provided, under a temporary coverage agreement, until a permanent policy is
issued.
<P>
<STRONG>What Happens if an Employee Leaves the Company?</STRONG><BR>
An employee who leaves the company is billed directly, in the manner that is most convenient
for him
or her. New York Life
provides him or her
with the flexibility to be billed on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual basis. The
amount of 
premium changes to reflect the billing option chosen.<P>
<STRONG>How Does the Cash Value of the Policy Grow?</STRONG><BR>
Cash values earn a competitive interest rate, which is credited and compounded
monthly. The cash
accumulation values grow income tax deferred and the interest rate credited is
guaranteed never to fall
below 4.5%.
<P>
<STRONG>Can  Additional Insurance be Purchased at a Later Date?</STRONG><BR>
Universal life insurance offers  the flexibility to adjust the insurance
coverage (within policy limits) to
accommodate changing needs.
<P>
<STRONG>How Does an Employee Know What Program is Best for Them?</STRONG><BR>
A New York Life agent  provides individualized counseling to help employees decide
what coverage
satisfies their needs and objectives.<P>
New York Life offers quality products, fast and efficient service, and an
outstanding track record of
proven success. New York Life has a long tradition of providing personal,
confidential service to people
across the country.

<STRONG>Life Insurance Protection For You and Your
Family</STRONG><BR>
New York Life, in cooperation with thousands of employers across the
country, offers a program
that can assist 
employees in providing protection and
financial security
for themselves and their families. This program allows employees of
participating companies
to purchase
individual permanent life insurance, through voluntary payroll
deduction, upon answering a
few simple
medical questions.
<P>
<STRONG>Program Highlights</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>Competitive Rates</STRONG> - Because the policy is being
offered through individual
employers
to all their employees,
premiums are competitive with rates found outside such a program.<P>
<STRONG>Cash Accumulation</STRONG> - In addition to life
insurance protection, the policy 
provides increasing cash
value, which may be used for emergencies, retirement, college
education, or other financial
needs.<P>
<STRONG>Convenient Payments</STRONG> - There are no checks
for employees to write, and
nothing for
them to mail. Premiums
are deducted from their paychecks before they receive them.<P>
<STRONG>Easy Participation</STRONG> - Completion of a short,
simple application is usually
all
that's needed. Physical
exams are usually not necessary.<P>
<STRONG>Optional Family Coverage</STRONG> - An employee's
spouse, children, and even
grandchildren
may
be able to obtain
quality protection - even if the employee doesn't participate - upon
answering a few simple medical
questions.<P>
<STRONG>Flexibility</STRONG> - Employees tailor their insurance
plan to meet their needs. 

<P>
We also offer a number of affordable options that allow
employees to
further enhance
their policy. Policy riders that waive the premium if employees become
unemployed or disabled are
available
at the point of sale. Should an employee become terminally ill, funds
from the policy may be
available during a
time of great financial need. A New York Life agent helps individual
employees design a plan that meets
their
specific objectives.<P>
<STRONG>Portability</STRONG> - Employees own their policy. If
they retire or leave their present
employer for
any reason, they  have
the right to continue the benefits of this policy. Several convenient
premium payment options
are even
available to satisfy their changing needs and/or new budget.
<P>
<STRONG>Common Questions</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>Who is Eligible for a Policy?</STRONG><BR>
Any employee of a participating company, age 16-65, who has been
working full-time (30+ hours per
week) for at least six
months
may apply for coverage. In addition, eligible employees may also apply
for coverage for their
spouses
and children or grandchildren (ages 15 days to 25 years).<P>
<STRONG>Does This Replace Other Employer-Provided Group Life
Insurance?</STRONG><BR>
No, this individual life insurance supplements any existing insurance
that employees may have.
Unlike many
group life insurance programs, it isn't reduced or eliminated when
employees retire or leave the
company.<P>
<STRONG>When Does the Insurance Begin?</STRONG><BR>
Immediately. Once an employee signs the application and the Payroll
Deduction Authorization form,
insurance is
initially provided, under a temporary coverage agreement, until a
permanent policy is
issued.<P>
<STRONG>What Happens if an Employee Leaves the
Company?</STRONG><BR>
An employee who leaves the company is billed directly, in the manner
that is most convenient for him
or her. New York Life
provides him or her
with the flexibility to be billed on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or
annual basis. The
amount of 
premium will change to reflect the billing option chosen.<P>
<STRONG>How Does the Cash Value of the Policy
Grow?</STRONG><BR>
The policy has a guaranteed cash value that increases annually when
premiums are paid on
the due
date. Also, dividends, which are not guaranteed,
can add to
the policy's value.<P>
<STRONG>How Much Insurance Are Eligible Employees Entitled to
Purchase?</STRONG><BR>
Eligible employees may spend any amount from $15 a month to a
premium that will purchase a
maximum face
amount of $100,000. The policy must have a minimum face amount of
$5,000.<P>
<STRONG>Can Eligible Employees Purchase Additional Insurance at a
Later Date?</STRONG><BR>
An additional policy (providing more coverage) can be purchased
during the annual
re-enrollment
period, as long as the combined face amounts of the policies does not
exceed $100,000.
<P>
Participation in the payroll deduction life insurance program is
completely voluntary.
Since this
program is not intended to be subject to the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974
(ERISA),
participating employers cannot contribute to or endorse any policy
offered under
this program.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>About New York Life</STRONG></FONT><P>

When New York Life opened its doors in 1845, Manhattan north of 14th Street was farm country; train
travel was a luxury; Abraham Lincoln was a country lawyer; and land beyond the Mississippi River was
considered the Wild West. We began as a single-product company, with just $18,000 in assets, in a
walk-up office at 57 Wall Street. Our first consideration was to pay all our finanical obligations when they
came due.<P>

It still is. After a century and a half of growth, New York Life now has consolidated assets of over $74
billion and a full range of financial products and services. Through a subsidiary, New York Life
Worldwide Holding, Inc., we have operations in Europe, Asia, and South
America.<P>
We've reached this position through prudent management, a wise investment philosophy, and
innovative product development. Today, New York Life and its affiliates offer much more than life
insurance. We provide individual annuities and an employees' disability income product, as well as an
array of mutual funds and investment products. Group life and health indemnity coverage and managed
care services are offered through a subsidiary, NYLCare.<P>

New York Life also offers its customers a wide variety of retail and institutional investment
opportunities. On the retail side, through the Company's broker/dealer subsidiary, NYLIFE Securities
Inc., customers can invest in the MainStay Family of Mutual Funds. On the institutional side, many
pension managers and plan sponsors have turned to MainStay and stable value products to help their clients
maximize their retirement savings.<P>

But whether it's to protect loved ones from a loss of income due to a breadwinner's death or disability,
or to create wealth for retirement, generations of customers have come to us for their financial needs.
They know New York Life will provide the high quality products and services to help them meet those needs.
That's why we're known as "The Company You Keep."<P>

As an employer, New York Life provides:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Valuable exposure to the exciting financial services industry;
<LI>A stimulating environment in which to expand your capabilities;
<LI>The opportunity to tap your own resources, and to learn from the experience and talents of a wide
range of professionals; 
<LI>A challenging position that lets you make a real contribution to the growth and success of a major
company.
</UL>
New York Life offers opportunities in areas such as accounting, 
actuarial science, asset management, auditing, communications, compliance, customer service, financial management, human resources, information systems, investments, legal, marketing, and mutual funds.
<P>


We seek employees with a wide range of abilities and talent. We have to -- our extensive customer
base and product lines demand it. Your skills will be put to the test as we continue to seek and
capitalize on opportunities within the financial services arena.<P>
We are shaping our Company to keep a step ahead of today's marketplace, without compromising the
service and financial security our customers expect. That means hiring and developing capable men
and women who can provide effective and innovative solutions for the problems people and
businesses face.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Enjoy Your Vacation While You Plan for Your Kid's
Education</STRONG></FONT><P>



	You've packed the car.  Your kids are buckled up and ready to go.  You remembered the
swim
fins,
the beach umbrella, and the gift for your friends in Florida.  This is going to be a terrific
vacation!  But as
you pull onto the highway, you get the strange feeling that there's something you forgot to
do.  <P>
	Even the most relaxed traveler can be preoccupied with the thought of starting an
investment plan
for
a child's college tuition.  You should know that there's no reason to procrastinate.  You can
just pick up
your car phone - or pull over at the next phone booth - and call your registered
representative to
discuss opening an UTMA account as soon as you return home.
<P>

<STRONG>What is UTMA?</STRONG><BR>
	The Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) - and in certain states, the Uniform Gift to
Minors Act
(UGMA)-
may be a way for you to save on taxes as you save for your children's education.  As state
laws may
vary, investors should consult their personal legal/tax professional for additional
information.  (This
Web page discusses UTMA since it has been adopted in the majority of states.)<P>
	By setting up an account in the child's name under the UTMA, you can make a transfer of
up to
$10,000 per year per child, without affecting your lifetime unified gift/estate tax credit. 
Since your
spouse
can do the same, together you can give each of your children up to $20,000 per year,
shifting
all or part
of the investment earnings to the child's tax rate, which may be lower than your own.  Even
if your
transfer is less than $10,000, the strategy may offer potential tax benefits.  Here's how
earnings are
currently taxed in an UTMA account:<P>
	Until your child turns age fourteen, the first $650 in unearned income each year is
covered by the
child's standard deduction and is not taxed.  The next $650 in unearned income may be taxed
at the
child's rate.  Unearned income above $1,300 per year is taxed at the parent's rate.<P>
	After your child turns age fourteen, the first $650 in unearned income each year is
covered by the
child's standard deduction and is not taxed.  Remaining income may be taxed at the child's
rate.
<P>

<STRONG>Help Make Saving for College Less Taxing</STRONG><BR>
	The table shows how an UTMA transfer may help reduce taxes and build a larger fund for
future
expenses.  It assumes a systematic investment of $150 per month in an UTMA account for a
child,
starting at age seven.  The account earns a hypothetical eight percent annual return, before
taxes.  If the
child's tax rate is fifteen percent (after the first $650 on interest, which is not taxed)
and the parent's tax
rate is twenty-eight percent, the table shows the potential tax advantages of the UTMA
investment.

<FONT SIZE="-1">This
chart is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to predict or guarantee the
results of any investment, which will vary with market conditions and fluctuations.  This
chart assumes an inflation rate of 4%.  Accordingly, the child's standard deduction will
increase over time.</FONT>

<p>

<STRONG>Easy to Set up</STRONG><BR>
	Setting up an UTMA account in a child's name is easy.  The account will involve a
custodian; your
registered representative can guide you in completing the application.  Separate accounts are
required
for transfers to each child.  Be sure to provide the child's Social Security number (not that
of the person
making the gift or of the custodian).  The custodian will have full authority to make
decisions, including
control over investments.<P>
	Since transfers must be permanent, parents can't gain access to the money for their own
use. 
Also,
all assets in the UTMA account will belong to the child when he or she reaches the age of
majority.  You
may also want to consider the possibility that assets held in your children's names could
affect the
level of financial aid they'll be eligible to receive when they apply to schools.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Estate Planning: It's A Fact of Life</STRONG></FONT><P>
Fact: Without proper estate planning over half the value of your estate could be lost to
federal estate taxes at death. In other words, the IRS, not your heirs, could be the single
largest beneficiary of your estate.<P>

<IMG SRC="/nyl/images/pfepflim.gif" ALT="Graph" ALIGN=RIGHT  BORDER="0">
<P>
Some people think estate planning is only necessary for those select individuals who appear
in episodes of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. Unfortunately, this misconception could
cost your heirs. Federal estate taxes begin at 37% for estates valued over $600,000 and can
climb as high as 60% for estates over $10,000,000 and under $21,040,000. In reality, if you
own assets, you need to plan for their future disposition. <P>
Do you need to worry about estate taxes? All too often, people underestimate the value of
their estate. Did you know that your estate includes your home, cash, investments, pension
benefits, personal property, trusts you own, alter, amend or revoke, certain life insurance
proceeds, and any other assets you and your spouse may own jointly or as community property?
The fact is, you are generally worth more than you think.<P>

Fortunately, there are a number of strategies designed to minimize the impact of estate
taxes. The following illustrates some of the most fundamental estate planning
techniques. <P>

<STRONG>Unlimited Marital Deduction</STRONG><BR>  
The unlimited marital deduction is one of the most powerful estate planning tools available.
The Internal Revenue Code allows an unlimited amount of property to be transferred to the
surviving spouse who is a U.S. citizen tax free when the first spouse dies. Therefore, if you
are willing to pass all of your assets to your surviving spouse, there will be no federal
estate tax exposure at that time. This is an effective strategy but it is not a complete
solution to your estate planning needs. Yes, a surviving spouse will receive the assets
estate tax free, but when he or she dies the entire estate will be subject to estate taxes.
Using the unlimited marital deduction does not eliminate estate taxes, it merely defers them
- leaving your heirs, in most cases your children, with the responsibility of paying the
estate tax bill. (Different rules apply to resident alien surviving spouses.)<P>

<STRONG>Unified Tax Credit</STRONG><BR>
The unified estate and gift tax credit of $192,800 allows you to give away up to $600,000
while you are alive to anyone you want, whenever you want, gift tax free. If married, you and
your spouse can combine your credits. By properly utilizing the unified tax credit you can
decrease the value of your estate by $1.2 million and save your heirs close to $400,000 in
estate taxes.<P>
By gifting money or property while alive, the income and appreciation on the gifted assets is
not part of your estate when you die and is not subject to federal estate taxes.<P>

<STRONG>Tax-Effective Will</STRONG><BR>
A tax-effective will utilizes a combination of the unlimited marital deduction and the
unified tax credit to reduce your estate tax exposure. Here's how it works: You and your
spouse establish a special account that allows the first-to-die spouse the right to leave up
to $600,000 of assets to heirs. This special account is a credit bypass trust. The estate tax
attributed to this trust is offset by the unified credit. If properly structured, any
remaining estate balance should qualify for the unlimited marital deduction. The surviving
spouse can be an income beneficiary of the credit bypass trust, and have the right to income
from the trust for life.<P>
At the death of the second spouse, the assets in the trust can pass to your beneficiaries
without being subject to estate taxes in the surviving spouse's estate. In addition, any
appreciation of the assets in the trust will pass to your heirs tax free.<P>

<STRONG>Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust</STRONG><BR>
There are basically two life insurance categories: traditional and second-to-die. Traditional
insurance is term, whole life, and universal life coverage that pays a death benefit after
the insured dies. Survivorship Whole Life insurance, or second-to-die insurance, insures two
individuals in one insurance plan and pays the death benefit after the death of the second
insured.<P>

Life insurance is a cost-effective funding vehicle for an estate plan. You pay pennies on the
dollar for life insurance protection, and your heirs may use the life insurance proceeds to
pay the estate tax bill, without depleting the estate's assets. However, if you own a life
insurance policy at death, the proceeds will be included in your gross estate. To avoid this,
you need to make sure you do not own the policy when you die. Also, be sure your estate is
not the beneficiary of your life insurance proceeds.<P>

Instead, create an irrevocable life insurance trust. You would gift cash to the trust so the
trust can make the necessary premium payments. The trust applies for, owns the policy, and
pays the premiums. At death, the insurance proceeds pass into the trust and escape estate
taxes. If properly structured, the trust can also provide benefits to a surviving spouse
and/or any other beneficiaries.<P>

If you were to transfer an existing life insurance policy to an irrevocable life insurance
trust, you must live three years from the date of transfer or the value of existing policy
proceeds will be brought back into your estate. To avoid this three-year rule, you must have
an irrevocable trust or other third-party owner apply for and purchase a new policy on your
life.<P>

<STRONG>Annual Exclusion Gifts</STRONG><BR>
By gifting a portion of money and property while alive, you can dramatically reduce the size
of your taxable estate. The federal Annual Exclusion Gift Law permits you to give $10,000
each year to as many individuals as you desire. Most people choose to give such gifts to
their children and grandchildren. If married, you and your spouse can give away up to $20,000
per recipient annually. Your gifts are income tax free to your recipients and each gift may
decrease the amount your heirs will have to pay in estate taxes.<P>

As you can see, estate planning is a little like surgery. No one can expect you to understand
it all, much less perform the operation yourself. But, wouldn't you rather plan today than
have your heirs lose 37 to 60 cents on the dollar later?<P>

<STRONG>William G. Burns</STRONG>, former Vice Chairman of NYNEX Corporation<BR>
<STRONG>Patricia T. Carbine</STRONG>, Co-founder and President of the Ms. Foundation for
Education and Communication, Inc.<BR>
<STRONG>Paul W. Douglas</STRONG>, retired Chairman and CEO of The Pittston Company<BR>
<STRONG>Kent B. Foster</STRONG>, President of GTE Corporation<BR>
<STRONG>Lee M. Gammill, Jr.</STRONG>, Vice Chairman of the Board of New York Life Insurance
Company<BR>
<STRONG>Richard L. Gelb</STRONG>, Chairman Emeritus of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company<BR>
<STRONG>William R. Grant</STRONG>, Chairman of Galen Associates<BR>
<strong>Conrad K. Harper</strong>, Partner at Simpson Thatcher & Bartlett<BR>
<STRONG>Harry G. Hohn</STRONG>, Chairman of the Board and CEO of New York Life Insurance
Company<BR>
<STRONG>Thomas W. Langfitt, M.D.</STRONG>, Chairman and CEO of The Glenmede
Corporation<BR>

<STRONG>Seymour Sternberg</STRONG>, President of New York Life Insurance Company<BR>
<P>
<STRONG>What are ratings?  Why are they so important?</STRONG><BR>
Independent ratings for insurance companies are based on their financial strength and ability
to pay claims  -- two critical factors in choosing an insurer.  The higher a company is rated,
the stronger and more reliable it is.  Four major companies -- Duff &amp; Phelps, Moody's
Investors Service, Standard &amp; Poor's, and A.M. Best -- have all given New York Life and NYLIAC
(its annuity subsidiary) high ratings.<P>

<STRONG>Term vs. Whole Life - What's the difference, and which one should I buy?
</STRONG><BR>
As with any insurance product, it depends on your needs.  Generally, the difference between
term life insurance and whole life insurance is that whole life is a permanent product that
builds cash value.  Policyowners can make loans against the cash value if needed.  It has a
higher initial premium, which remains level throughout the life of the policy.<P>

Term is a temporary insurance product with a fairly low initial premium, which increases as
you get older.  Beneficiaries will receive insurance proceeds only if death occurs within a
specified period - the "term" of the contract.  A term policy offers protection only and does
not build cash value.<P>

<STRONG>How can I get more information?</STRONG><BR>

<STRONG>Building Your Financial Foundation</STRONG>
<P>



Moving out of your parents' house and having a go of it on your own can be a shock
to the system.  After
decades of living in the comfort of family, you're suddenly faced with the harsh
realities of life - bills,
bills, bills.  How does one deal with these new-found responsibilities? You can
start by building a
sound financial foundation.  Acting discerningly on these matters could make the
difference between
making it on your own, or moving back with the folks.  Choose wisely...
<P>
<STRONG>Banking</STRONG> - Shop around.  You shouldn't necessarily stick with your
current bank
just because you've
been with them a long time.  You may want to open both a savings account for
earning interest, and a
checking account for paying the bills.  It's important to compare interest rates,
but you also should be
wary of charges for services. 
Some banks allow you to "link" your accounts to reduce fees.  Many local newspapers
run a "scorecard"
of bank rates, which can be helpful.  Although deposits up to $100,000 are
federally insured, you'll still
want to choose a financially strong institution.  If possible, have your employer
"direct deposit" your
paychecks into your bank.  
<P>
<STRONG>Health Insurance</STRONG> - With medical costs spiraling upward, having
sufficient
health insurance is a
necessity.  If you're job hunting, you should take a serious look at the medical
benefits offered by
prospective employers.  If you're fortunate, your employer will offer a group
health plan.  If not, it's
essential to obtain some type of individual health insurance.
<P>
<UL>  
<LI>Major Medical Plans typically offer a fee-for-coverage arrangement for a range
of services including
physicians' costs, medical tests, hospital fees, etc.  With some plans, you may go
to a doctor of your
own choice and your insurer reimburses you a predetermined percentage of cost. 
Most plans have
deductibles, which is the amount of money you must pay out-of-pocket before the
insurer begins paying
the expenses.  
<LI>Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) have become a popular option because of
their
minimal out-of-pocket cost.  Generally, members must visit only doctors affiliated
with the HMO;
however your co-payment could be as low as $5-$10 per visit.
When evaluating different plans it's important to consider what services are
covered, and the
co-payments and deductibles that are involved.
</UL>
<P>  
<STRONG>Life Insurance</STRONG> - If you think it's just for "older people," think
again.  If you have
student loans from your
college days, you may want to consider having some life insurance to cover them,
and then some.  It's
probably a good idea to purchase a policy now, because generally the younger you
are, the lower the
premium.  Two of the basic types of life insurance are whole life and term life. 
Whole life is permanent
insurance - it's yours for as long as you continue to pay the premiums.  The
premiums are fixed and
the policy cannot be canceled by the insurer.  Over the long-term, the policy
builds "cash value" that can
be tapped into for financial needs.  Term insurance provides inexpensive coverage
over a
pre-determined period of time - 5 years, 10 years, etc.  It is pure protection and
does not build cash
value.  One type is not necessarily "better" than the other, but you may find that
a mixture of the two may
best suit your needs.
<P>
<STRONG>Building Credit</STRONG> - If you plan on buying a home, starting a
business, or doing
anything in the future that
requires borrowed money, you'll definitely want to start building a credit history
now.  Getting a credit
card and paying it off faithfully is a good way to start.  Many banks and
organizations offer VISA and
Mastercard with lots of bells and whistles attached - product discounts, airline
mileage, etc. - but
don't overlook the basics.  
<P>
You'll want to find a deal that offers worldwide acceptance, no annual fee, and a
low interest rate.  If you
don't have any credit history or if it's poor, there's still an alternative.  Some
banks offer a "secured
credit card," which is an arrangement where you deposit funds in an account that
are then used as your
credit limit.  Of course, the key to building good credit is to spend within your
means.  
<P>
<STRONG>Looking to The Long-Term</STRONG> - Building a financial foundation
means
planning for the long haul. 
If your employer offers a 401(k) or similar plan you'll certainly want to take
advantage of this convenient,
tax-deferred retirement plan.  IRAs, CDs, annuities and mutual funds are options to
consider to help
build your nest egg.  The key to realizing your financial dreams is starting now
while you have a long
time horizon.  <P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Financing Your Children's Education</STRONG></FONT><P>

Millions of Americans, especially the "Baby Boomers" born in the 20 years following
World
War II, now
have children of their own and are starting to think about how to pay for future
educational
expenses.
Four years at the best universities can now cost close to $100,000, and these
expenses
have been
rising faster than inflation. Middle-income families that do not expect to benefit
from
scholarships or
receive substantial financial aid must save this money in advance or borrow it
later. The
simplest way to
save money is in a savings account at a bank, but more sophisticated investments
may
provide better
returns. <P>

<P>
One factor that slows the growth of savings is income taxes, which apply to
ordinary bank
interest.
Consider a long term certificate of deposit paying 7 percent interest. If $10,000
were
invested and
accumulated tax-free for 15 years, it would grow to $27,590. However, if Federal
and state
income taxes
took 35 percent of the interest every year, the initial $10,000 investment would
grow to just
$19,492. The
difference, $8,098, is significant. Even if the taxes on interest had to be paid
when the
money was
withdrawn, after 15 years, the $27,590 would be reduced to $21,434, still $1,942
ahead of
paying the
taxes annually. The difference is due to interest earned on the tax dollars that
were not paid
until
later.<P>

For many years, the tax laws provided numerous ways to defer income taxes on
investment
earnings.
(Deferred taxes are not paid immediately but are paid later, usually when funds are
withdrawn. Income
taxes cannot normally be avoided forever, except at death.) During the 1980s, most
of those
special
rules were repealed. Three notable, but by no means the only, exceptions involve
life
insurance, mutual
funds, and U.S. savings bonds.<P>

Life insurance proceeds paid at death have always been free of income taxes. Less
well-known, but
equally important, is the fact that the growth in cash value of insurance policies
is also
tax-free for
individuals as long as the funds remain in the policy and are not withdrawn. Thus,
the cash
value
accumulates without any tax reduction and can be borrowed when needed to pay for
education (or for
other reasons) without tax consequences in most cases.<P>

A special rule applies to so-called "modified endowment contracts," policies that
are strongly
investment-oriented. Check with your agent to see if your policy qualifies as a
borrowed
when needed to
pay for education (or for other reasons) without tax consequences in most
cases.modified
endowment
contract.<P>

Mutual funds can also provide tax advantages. Even if the mutual fund pays
currently
taxable interest or
dividends, income taxes can be reduced by putting assets in a child's name. Until
1987, this
technique,
which relies on the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA), was very effective in
reducing
income taxes,
because all income was taxed at the child's rate, which normally is low. Then
Congress
changed the
law, so that so-called "unearned" income (which includes interest and dividends)
received
by children
under age 14 is partly taxed at the rate applying to the child's parents. Even so,
children
under 14 can
receive up to $550 in unearned income without paying any income tax. The
next
$550 is taxed
at the child's own tax rate, typically 15 percent. Any unearned income exceeding
$1,100 is
taxed at the
parents' rate.<P>

Another investment possibility with tax advantages is U.S. Savings bonds. These
bonds are
purchased
for half their face amount and pay variable market-based interest rates if held for
five years
or longer.
The interest rate is 85 percent of the rate on certain Treasury securities and
varies every six
months.
Federal income tax is normally not paid until the bonds are redeemed, and they are
complete exempt
from state income taxes.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Fixed Deferred Annuities</STRONG></FONT><P>

	Fixed annuities are viewed as secure investments by many people, since the insurance
company that offers the annuity guarantees the current cash value plus a future guaranteed
interest rate.  Today, they often offer interest rates that are comparable to (or higher
than) CDs, along with the added benefit of deferring taxes on the earnings until they
are withdrawn.  Unlike annuities, CDs are FDIC insured.



<P>
	Fixed annuities, unlike many other fixed interest investments, contain guarantees of
minimum future interest rates.  All fixed annuities have a minimum rate guarantee that
specifies the lowest rate the insurer can offer.  Some contracts also offer a "bailout"
provision that allows the owner to withdraw money from the annuity without surrender
charges
if the crediting rate falls by more than a specific amount.

Investing in mutual funds is as easy as picking up the phone.
<P>
	Just call a NYLIFE Securities Registered Representative to discuss what you hope to
achieve, when
you'll need
your
money, and how you feel about risk and reward.
<P>
	Your answers will assist your investment professional in helping you decide  which
mutual funds
are right for you.  The prospectus contains more complete information about the Funds
you've selected,
including advisory fees, other expenses, and share classes.  Please read it carefully before
you invest
or send money.
<P>
	Once you've invested, your Registered Representative is your best source for answers
about your

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>How Younger Consumers Can Benefit From Whole Life
Insurance
</STRONG></FONT><P>


<STRONG>Looking Toward Tomorrow</STRONG><BR>
According to a recent survey<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>, more people between the
ages of 18
to 34 believe in
UFOs  more than they believe that there will be money left in Social Security when they
retire. 
One could dismiss this
merely as the voice of a cynical generation but many financial experts have also
expressed reservations
regarding the future of the U.S. Social Security system.  With working baby-boomers
comprising a large
portion of the U.S. population, the current Social Security system, funded by the
nation's workforce, is
fine.  But what happens when today's boomers retire, and become tomorrow's
recipients of Social
Security benefits?  What if there are more people receiving benefits, in the next
century, than there are in
the workforce funding those benefits?  
<P>
Many individuals in their twenties and thirties aren't wasting time speculating -
they're planning for the
future.  According to the June 15, 1995 Wall Street Journal, 61% of
"twenty-somethings" responding to a
survey sponsored by Kemper Financial Services, Inc. (a Chicago based money
management firm)
stated that they or their spouse had put money aside for retirement.  The article
also revealed that many
respondents "were prepared to cut personal spending now in order to save for
retirement."  Even more
so than the boomers before them, today's under-35s are planning for the long-term
future.  With a
responsible mind focused on the future, it's also important to keep an eye on
today, as well.
<P>
Perhaps this is why one of the preferred long-term financial vehicles named by the
respondents of the
Kemper poll was life insurance.  It's wise to want to preserve future assets as
long as it does not turn
into a situation of "putting the cart before the horse."  While the baby boomer
generation may have been
inclined to ignore insurance in favor of financial products with potentially
quicker and higher returns,
more and more consumers under thirty-five have recognized the long-term advantages
of products
such as whole life insurance. The first asset that younger consumers should seek to
protect -
perhaps the most important asset - is themselves, and what they have today.  Whole
life is a smart
step in that direction.
<P>
<STRONG>Starting With Today</STRONG><BR>
The beauty of whole life insurance is that it not only offers the long-term
benefits of cash value and
tax-deferred accumulation, but it also offers immediate coverage in the event of a
tragedy.  For a married
individual, the need for life insurance is obvious; so much rides on an income the
family is counting on:
the mortgage payments, living expenses, child care costs - even the future plans
for a child's
education.
<P>
For young single individuals, the life insurance need is sometimes less obvious,
but just as real.  A
crucial step toward true independence lies in making sure that no one else will be
forced to shoulder
the consequences of choices that we've made.  Many people in their twenties have to
borrow money
from their families, or from financial institutions.  Frequently, young singles
with student loans, car
loans, or mortgages on a condo are only able to secure these funds by having a
loved one co-sign the
loan, as well.  If something were to happen to the young single person, the person
who co-signed the
loan would be fully responsible for the debt repayment.  What if there were not
enough liquid resources
to pay off the debts and loans?  Losing a loved one is difficult enough; combined
with having to deal
with exorbitant financial debts and struggles, it quickly becomes a devastating
experience. 
<P>
Whole life insurance protects against the financial consequences of these potential
tragedies, and it
also gives the younger consumer a financial foundation to build on for the rest of
his/her life.  With cash
value, tax deferred growth, and the accumulation potential of dividends<A
HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>, whole life
insurance can easily evolve from today's protection plan to the beginning of
tomorrow's retirement plan. 
What's more: the younger the insured, the more affordable insurance is.  Since
everyone needs this
coverage sooner or later, it's
a good idea to get it when it's more affordable - and when good health will usually
assure coverage. 
Unfortunately, once health has declined, insurance is often no longer an option. 
Ironically, this could be
when people need it the most.
<P>
Whether anticipating the future or focusing on today, the under-35 consumer should
always keep this in
mind: the ideal plan allows for today's protection as well as tomorrow's
possibilities. The financial
choices made today impact the rest of one's life.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>IRAs: Still One of the Best Ways to
Save</STRONG></FONT><P>


Most retirement experts agree that you will need about 70%-75% of your
working
income to maintain
your current lifestyle in retirement. Unfortunately, Social Security
will provide
only a portion of this
income. According to the Social Security Administration, the average
monthly Social
Security check in
1994 was just $674.  Factor in that most Americans are living longer
and it becomes
clear that you will
need additional sources of income if you hope to live comfortably in
retirement.
<P>
<STRONG>A Simple and Effective Retirement Planning Tool</STRONG><BR>
One of the easiest ways to start building wealth and saving for
retirement is
through an Individual
Retirement Account (IRA). An IRA is a tax-deferred vehicle that
provides you with
the opportunity to
invest in various instruments. These include: stocks, bonds,
money-market funds,
government
securities, unit investment trusts, and mutual funds.<P>
Since the IRA is a tax-deferred account, all of your contributions and
earnings
will compound and
accumulate quicker than money placed in a similar taxable account. Over
the long
haul, this tax
advantage will significantly increase your retirement nest egg.
<P>
<STRONG>Eligibility Requirements</STRONG><BR>
Anyone who receives compensation for working during the year (including
wages,
salaries,
commissions, and professional fees) can establish an IRA. The maximum
amount you
may contribute
per year is the lesser of $2,000 or 100% of your annual
compensation.<P>
If you have a non-working spouse, you may contribute an additional $250
into the
plan on your spouse's
behalf. This would increase the maximum contribution for the year to
$2,250. The
contribution would
have to be made into two separate accounts and may be divided in any
fashion as
long as no more
than $2,000 is contributed to either IRA. The extra account is called a
spousal
IRA.  
<P>
<STRONG>IRA Deductibility Limits</STRONG><BR>
If both you and your spouse are employed, but are not considered active
participants in your employer's
qualified retirement plans, your IRA contributions are fully
deductible. (Two
individual IRAs must be set
up.) If you and your spouse file a joint tax return, a maximum
deduction of $4,000
would be allowed.
This deduction will reduce your taxable income and your current income
tax bill.  
If both you and your spouse participate in your employer's qualified
retirement
plans, your deduction for
your contribution may be reduced or eliminated depending on your annual
adjusted
gross income.
Singles with adjusted gross incomes of $25,000 or less and married
couples with
adjusted gross
incomes of $40,000 or less can deduct their entire IRA contribution. As
your annual
income increases,
the amount you can deduct gradually decreases. Deductions are reduced
by $200 for
every $1,000 of
income over $40,000 ($25,000 for singles).  
<P>
<STRONG>The Power Of Tax Deferral</STRONG><BR>
Even if you cannot deduct your annual contribution, IRAs still offer a
powerful
advantage - tax-deferred
growth. All of the earnings on amounts contributed to an IRA are not
taxed until
they are withdrawn. For
example, if you were to invest $2,000 annually, assuming an 8% return
and a 33%
combined federal,
state, and local income tax bracket, after 30 years, a tax-deferred
account could
potentially grow to
$244,692.  Under this same scenario, a taxable account would have grown
to
$148,971. That is
$95,721, or 64%, more in the tax-deferred account than in the taxable
account.<SUP><FONT
SIZE="-1"><A HREF="#1">1</A></FONT></SUP>
<P>

<STRONG>Time Is Still Available</STRONG><BR>
An IRA should serve as the cornerstone for your retirement plan.
Whether retirement
is years away or
just around the corner, you owe it to yourself to prepare now for a
future that's
free of financial worry.
Implementing a disciplined approach to investing can put you on the
path toward
your retirement
dreams. You have until April 15, 1996 to make the maximum 1995
contribution of
$2,000. And instead
of waiting another full year, you could invest $4,000 today (for 1996
and 1997) and
let the power of tax
deferral start working toward your retirement dreams.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Immediate Annuities</STRONG></FONT><P>

	While deferred annuities are designed to help you maximize savings, immediate
annuities
are there to make sure your savings provide an income for as long as you need it. 
Immediate
annuities, as the name implies, begin paying you an immediate income and last for a
specific
time period that you select.  They are often designed to pay as long as you live. 
These
annuities are commonly used to provide pension benefits to retired employees.<P>
	The benefit of an immediate annuity is the consistent and stable income it
provides. 
You know that a check for a specific amount will be received on a regular basis and
that the
income will continue for as long as you have requested.  You can even arrange for
an
annuity
to pay for as long as you or your spouse lives.  This last option is called a Joint
and
Survivor Immediate Annuity.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Increasing Premium Term Insurance</STRONG></FONT><P>

Increasing Premium Term (IPT) offers temporary life insurance protection at a low initial
premium.  IPT is guaranteed renewable through the contract's expiry age and includes a
conversion privilege which is available until age 70.  The coverage it provides could help
families and business owners safeguard their financial future.
<P>
<STRONG>The Benefits of IPT</STRONG>

<UL>
<LI>The peace of mind of pure life insurance protecion
<LI>A death benefit that is, in most instances, free from federal income tax
<LI>An initial premium that is considerable lower than a comparable permanent plan
<LI>Guaranteed renewable coverage through the contract's expiry date (see"Product Specifics"
for variations)
<LI>The privilege to convert to a permanent policy that builds cash value (See "Conversion
Privilege")
<LI>A <EM>Conversion Credit</EM> that's applied against the new policy's first year premium
<LI>The financial strength of New York Life
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>The Uses of IPT</STRONG><BR>
There are many situations where IPT may be appropriate.  Here are just a few examples:
<UL>
<LI>Temporary Need for Protection
<DL>
	<DT>When coverage is needed for a relatively short period of time, IPT can be ideal.  A
common use is when a mortgage or student loan is taken.
<P>
<LI>Limited Funds
<DT>In situations where life insurance is essential but dollars are scarce, IPT could serve
as a stop-gap.  Young people starting their careers can choose IPT, then convert to a
permanent plan as their finances improve.
<P>
<LI>Supplemental Insurance
<DT>IPT can be added as a rider to some permanent plans to help boost the death benefit. 
It's an affordable way to increase total insurance coverage.
<P>
<LI>Provide Family Coverage
<DT>Optional riders such as <EMSpouse and Children's Insurance, and Children's Insurance</EM>
can be added to the policy to extend coverage to family members.  See "Riders" section for
more information.
<P>
<LI>Protection For Businessowners
<DT>IPT can be used as a hedge to cover outstanding loans, shielding partners or shareholders
from financial hardship.

In 1995, for the first time, both new life insurance and annuity premiums surpassed $1 billion.  Our
Individual Life area introduced Whole Life, Modified Premium Whole Life, and Employee's Whole Life
products with higher guaranteed cash values; new Survivorship Whole Life plans, and new features on
Variable Universal Life.  The enhancements spurred career agents, who wrote 17% more life insurance
applications than last year.  In addition, our Brokerage operation produced over $500 million in new
premium.<P>
	Our Individual Annuity line of business also set a record: Sales through agents and supplemental
distribution channels totaled $1.4 billion, a 42% increase from 1994; assets under management
reached nearly $12 billion; and LifeStages, a new variable annuity, was introduced.<P>
	The individual Policy Services Department now provides enhanced service to agents and policy
owners through service centers located in Atlanta; Cleveland; Dallas; Minneapolis; and San Ramon,
California.  Our toll-free number for client services will soon appear on consumer correspondence,
making it easier for you, our valued clients, to obtain assistance.<P>
	Our Agency Department remains committed to the people who serve you.  NYLIC University, an
intensive training program, advances the skills of managers and agents - 1995 enrollment swelled as
we hired 2,500 new agents, an increase of 18% over 1994.  Preparing for a changing future, our
Marketing Department developed targeted strategies for growth markets, such as small business,
ethnic, and fifty-plus.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Inflation</STRONG></FONT><P>


	As time passes, the rising cost of goods and services can also affect the value
of your
investments. 
This process, known as inflation, may reduce the amount of food, clothing, housing,
and
healthcare
your money can buy.  If the cost of living rises faster than the value of your
savings or
investments, you
could actually be losing money.  Even modest inflation can eat away at the dollars
you set
aside, which
is one important reason why many people use investments to seek higher return
potential.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Introduction</STRONG></FONT><P>


Formed in 1845 by Pliny Freeman, a dry goods store owner, and a number of New York business,
political and financial leaders, the Nautilus Insurance Company was the third mutual life
insurance company established in the U.S.  On an initial investment of $17,946, insurance
sales for the first year were about $790,000.   In 1849, the name was changed to New York Life Insurance
Company.<P>
From the outset, Freeman knew the kind of individual who would be successful working with the
Company, and he conducted an aggressive recruiting campaign to find "capable, energetic
agents" to work in all the settled territories.  As pioneers moved west, New York Life agents
were there to greet them.  Famous men like Lew Wallace, author of Ben Hur, and Schuyler
Colfax, who became Ulysses S. Grant's Vice President, represented the Company.  At that time,
selling and servicing insurance had not yet become a career in itself.  Agents were local
doctors, lawyers, bankers, etc., who offered policies as an added service.<P>

In the twentieth century, despite war, the Great Depression, stock market upheavals and
economic instability both at home and around the world, New York Life remained solid by
staying true to its guiding principles of prudent expansion, conservative growth,
full-service and a strong Field Force.  The Company's conservative approach has
enabled it to grow steadily and provide outstanding service.  New York Life has never
faltered on its obligations and has put the financial well-being of its policyholders above
every other concern.<P>
The Company's dedication to service has given our customers an unprecedented level
of security.  As a result, our agents have earned a level of respect from our customers and
the insurance industry that is second to none.

saving for a
family vacation, or saving enough for a down payment on a new home.<P>

The sooner you start investing, the more  you can set aside and the longer your
money
can work for you.  While past performance is no guarantee of future results, in the
past, those
who have
stayed invested for 20 years or more have generally earned positive total returns.<P>
	People who wait to invest may be missing opportunities.  No one can say where the
markets will
move next.  If you're looking for the "perfect moment," you may never know when it
comes. 
The wise
strategy is to invest today and adjust your holdings over time.<P>

1995 was an excellent year for our Investment operations.  The area performed well across all asset
classes, making significant contribution to New York Life's financial strength.  Declining interest rates
and moderate economic growth led to a soaring stock market and a benign environment for bond
investors.<P>
	The strength of the stock market helped us realize substantial capital gains in our private equity
portfolio.  Our credit skills and knowledge of capital markets also enabled us to take advantage of new
investment vehicles, including bank loans, equity-linked notes, and commercial mortgage-backed
securities.  Our London office, opened in late 1994, completed its first year by originating almost $250
million of attractive fixed-income investments.  In addition, our Private Finance Team launched a
successful third-party money management and advisory business for institutional clients, including
pension plans and other insurance companies.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Keeping Your Business in the Family
</STRONG></FONT><P>

	Owning your own business is a most cherished American dream. 
While a family-owned business
can provide financial benefits - capital growth, salary, fringe
benefits etc. - the real
benefits are often
more personal.  A family-owned firm can provide a better working
environment than a large
impersonal
company.  Family members can take pride in seeing the family name
on products and on the sign
outside the door.  A well run family firm not only stresses
personal service and customer
loyalty, but
also provides benefits to the local community.<P>
	Some business owners build a business with an eye to selling it
to the highest bidder. 
Many
entrepreneurs, however, hope that the business they have built
will remain within the family. 
When
members of the founding generation retire, with proper business
continuation plans in place,
they can
take pleasure in knowing that the firm is in good hands.  Such
happy endings, however, cannot
be
taken for granted.  According to a study by the Journal of
Accountancy, fewer than fifty
percent of family
businesses survive past the second generation.
<P>
<STRONG>Challenges to Retaining the Business in the
Family</STRONG><BR>
	
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI><STRONG>No Qualified or Interested Family Member:</STRONG>
Some firms do have an
employee
who could run the business, but that person is not a family
member.  Perhaps the children are
too
young, have other interests, or lack the founder's drive, feel
for the market, or technical
skills.
<LI><STRONG>Limited Access to Capital:</STRONG>  A child may not
have the same relationship
with
the bankers, suppliers, bonding company, and customers as the
prior generation.
<LI><STRONG>Death, Disability, or Retirement: </STRONG> Senior
management may leave, whether
through death, disability, or retirement, before the next
generation is prepared to assume
control.
<LI><STRONG>Disgruntled Second-Tier Management:</STRONG>  A
senior employee who has given
his or her life to a company may find it difficult to work for a
"boss" young enough to be
his or her child. 
First-rate salaried managers often leave to become the next
generation's most potent
competitors.
<LI><STRONG>Current Income versus Growth of Firm:</STRONG>  The
retired generation may be
concerned about income to meet living expenses.  The children may
want to retain profits to
grow the
business.  That could spell trouble.
<LI><STRONG>Estate Taxes:</STRONG>  A closely held corporation is
an illiquid asset.  Taxes
are
assessed based on "fair market value" at a date of death.  Fair
market value is what a
"Willing seller
would accept from a willing buyer."  Often, however, there are no
willing buyers.  Other
assets, or even
the firm itself, may have to be liquidated to cover the estate
taxes due.
<LI><STRONG>Family Differences:</STRONG> The eldest daughter has
an aptitude for business,
but
her husband has transferred to another city.  The son wants to
run the business, and lives in
town, but 
has much to learn.  How are parents to do what is right for each
child, when they have only
one large
illiquid asset to divide?
</UL>

<P>
	Obviously, business continuity planning is not simple.  Some of
the problems are reducible
to
money.  Money can provide for estate taxes,
purchase a retiring owner's
interest, or
provide an equivalent asset for the children who will not enter
the business.  Along with the
financial
considerations, appropriate legal agreements may need to be
drafted, and coordinated with the
will and
estate plan.<P>
	It is up to the business owner to set the planning wheels in
motion.  Here's how to begin:
<P>
<STRONG>Planning Steps</STRONG><BR>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI><STRONG>Clarify Goals:</STRONG>  What would you, as an
owner, prefer?  To work in the
business for as long as possible?  To retire at a certain age? 
To provide for your children
the lifestyle
and status you have enjoyed?  To reward key employees who have
helped you build the business?
	<LI><STRONG>Consider the Children:</STRONG>  Who wants to
continue the firm?  What are the
feelings of the others?  Who, if anyone, has the needed
abilities?  What training is taking
place now?
	<LI><STRONG>Appoint a Project Manager:</STRONG>  No person is
likely to have all the skills
needed to make your vision of the future a reality.  Your
attorney, CPA, banker, and
insurance advisor
are all essential members of your strategic planning team.  You
may want to give one the
overall
responsibility of researching the possible strategies and
presenting recommendations for your
approval.
</UL>
<P>
	As the owner of a family business, you made the company what it
is today.  Some simple
planning
can help ensure that your business continues to thrive for many
years.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Life Insurance For Retirement Planning</STRONG></FONT><P>


Once you retire, will you have any need for life insurance?  The answer to that
question may
not be as
simple as it seems.  Retirement does not necessarily mean the end to your need for
life
insurance. 
However, as with any other major life change, you should re-evaluate your life
insurance
coverage to be
sure it is adequate.<P>
If, as you near retirement, you still have dependents who would suffer financial
hardship if
you die, you
should consider having life insurance.  On the other hand, if you no longer have
dependents, you may
find you have less of a need for life insurance.<P>
So, what are your options with your life insurance policy?  One place to start is
to talk with
your agent. 
He or she can help you determine what is appropriate for you in your situation.
<P>
Here are some ideas that you might want to discuss with your agent if you have a
whole life
policy:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Keep the policy in force indefinitely by converting it to a paid-up policy. 
You pay no
more
premiums, but the amount of insurance is reduced.  The accumulated cash value
remains
intact, and
you retain the option of borrowing against it.
<LI>Use the policy's accumulated cash value to purchase an annuity, which can
provide a
guaranteed
lifetime income. Or, you might use the cash value for another investment.  However,
be
aware that
income taxes likely will be due.  Taxes will be based on the sum of the cash value
plus
dividends you
receive that exceed the premiums you have paid while the policy was in force
(dividends are
based on
the policy's applicable dividend scale or interest crediting rate which is neither
guaranteed
nor an
estimate of future performance). 
</UL>
<P>
If you keep the policy in force as paid-up insurance until death, no income taxes
will be
payable.
<P>
Regardless of the type of life insurance policy you have, it is a good idea to
review your
coverage and
options with your agent, as you approach retirement age to be sure that your policy
will meet
your
needs.  <P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>LifeStages<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> - A
Variable
Annuity From NYLIAC</STRONG></FONT><P>



Are you concerned you won't have enough money to finance the retirement you
want? 
Are you
worried
you'll outlive your income after you do retire?  With expenses, taxes, and
inflation eating
away at your
income, the amount of money you'll need for your future is certainly a moving
target.<P>
Merely saving isn't enough anymore.  To make your money go further, you need a
product that
can adapt to your long-term financial goals, one that gives you control over
your
funds and
the freedom
to change course when necessary.  And you need a product that gives you the
advantage of
proven
money management techniques yet still provides a measure of security. <P>
LifeStages<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> offers all this - and more. 
LifeStages<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> is a variable annuity that can
provide income
for your retirement.  Your earnings accumulate on a tax-deferred basis, which
may
help your
money
accumulate faster than it would in a similar but taxable investment.  With
LifeStages<FONT
SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> you
control how your money's invested.  And when you retire, you'll
control how you receive your money - LifeStages<FONT
SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT>
can even
offer you income for the rest of your life.<P>
LifeStages<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> is issued by New York Life
Insurance
and
Annuity Corporation (NYLIAC), a wholly owned subsidiary of New York Life
Insurance
Company
and available through NYLIFE Securities Inc. (member NASD) 51 Madison Avenue, NY
NY
10010. 
<P>
<STRONG>Select From a Variety of Options</STRONG><BR>
Since no one understands your retirement goals better than you, you decide how
your
funds in
LifeStages<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> can be invested.  You can
allocate
your money
to stock, bond, balanced, international or money market accounts - or to the
Fixed
Account
that's fully
backed by assets in NYLIAC's general account.<P>
What's more, you're not locked into your choices.  When your lifestyle or
financial
goals
change, you can
change your mind - and your investment choices - simply by calling our toll-free
number.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="#1">1</A></FONT></SUP> 
<P>
<STRONG>Benefit From Professional Management</STRONG><BR>
Although you choose the investment accounts, you're certainly not on your own. 
The
professional fund
managers at MacKay-Shields Financial Corporation Financial Corporation, Monitor
Capital
Advisors, Inc., Calvert
Asset
Management Company, Inc., and New York Life manage the LifeStages<FONT
SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> portfolio accounts.  They are experienced financial
advisors with
proven
track records in investment management.
<P>
<STRONG>Control Your Premium Schedule</STRONG><BR>
LifeStages<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> offers an extremely flexible
premium
arrangement.  Initially, the minimum premium is $2,000 for tax-qualified plans,
or
$5,000 for
non-qualified plans.  You can then add to your annuity as you wish, with a
minimum
premium of
$500.
<P>
<STRONG>Earn Special Additional Interest Rate</STRONG><BR>
When you add new funds to the Fixed Account, a special interest rate will be
credited to that
money
during the first contract year.  After the first year, those funds will earn
renewal rates
set annually.
<P>
<STRONG>Keep In Touch</STRONG><BR>
With LifeStages<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT>, quality service is just a
phone call
away. 
Use our toll-free number to get information on your policy's cash value, to
transfer money
between
accounts, or to change the allocation of your future premium payments.  You'll
also
receive
quarterly
statements to keep you up-to-date on your policy.
<P>
<STRONG>The Power of Tax Deferral</STRONG><BR>
Earnings in LifeStages<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> accumulate
tax-deferred. 
In other
words, you don't pay taxes on earnings until you withdraw your money.  That
means
money may
accumulate faster than it would in a similar but currently taxable investment.
(Remember,
withdrawals
prior to age 591/2 may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty.)
<P>
<STRONG>Control Your Taxes</STRONG><BR>
Here's another advantage of tax deferral:  since you aren't taxed on annuity
proceeds until
you withdraw
them, you can plan your withdrawals so you're not hit too hard by Uncle Sam. 
After
you
retire, you may
find yourself in a lower tax bracket - perhaps you can wait until then before
you
withdraw
your money.  Or
you can withdraw funds prudently, so you don't push yourself into a higher
bracket. 
An
annuity can offer
genuine tax control.  It can help your money accumulate - and last.
<P>
<STRONG>Select a Balance That's Right For You</STRONG><BR>
No two people have identical needs and concerns.  Depending on your life stage
and
your
financial
goals, you'll want to make sure you choose the investment mix that meets your
needs.  Perhaps
you're
younger and want to be more aggressive in your investment choices - you can
allocate your
money to
investment choices that offer the potential for higher return.  Later you may
prefer to
balance your
aggressive investments with those that offer a higher measure of safety.  And if
you're
nearing
retirement or have already retired, a more conservative allocation may suit your
goals
perfectly. 
LifeStages<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> allows you to change your
investment
strategy
as your needs change.
<P>
<STRONG>Set a Course</STRONG><BR>
Some people track their investment accounts daily - others set a course and let
it
run
itself. 
LifeStages<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> gives you those options.
<P>
<STRONG>Dollar Cost Averaging Option</STRONG><BR>
"Making money is easy," a wit said.  "You simply buy low and sell high."  But
how
can you
predict when
prices will be "low" or "high?"  You may not need to if you dollar cost average. 
With dollar
cost
averaging, you set up a program of scheduled investments - given dollar amounts
invested at
given
points in time - and stick to it, regardless of the changes in the markets. 
This
consistent,
disciplined
approach allows you to take advantage of market volatility by buying more
investment units
when prices
are low and fewer when prices are high.  Although dollar cost averaging does not
ensure a
profit nor
protect against a loss in a declining market, over time a sustained dollar cost
averaging
strategy can
reduce your timing risk and optimize your return. Investors should consider
their
financial
ability to continue purchases through periods of low and high price levels.<P>
<P>
<STRONG>Automatic Asset Reallocation Option</STRONG><BR>
Let's say you want to maintain a particular allocation of your assets in 
investment
divisions, for
example, 40% in Bond, 40% in Capital Appreciation and 20% in Cash Management. 
Since
portfolio
values change at different rates, you may need to move money between investment
divisions to
keep
your desired ratio.  It's a popular investment strategy, but it requires a lot
of
maintenance. 
<P>Fortunately, LifeStages<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> offers an
Automatic
Asset
Reallocation feature that allows you to specify when - quarterly,
semi-annually,
or annually
- NYLIAC
will review your accounts and automatically make any necessary transfers to
bring
your
distribution
back into the balance you selected.
<P>
<STRONG>Payout at Retirement</STRONG><BR>
The goal of any annuity - including LifeStages<FONT
SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT>
- is to
provide retirement income.  And with LifeStages<FONT
SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT>, you can
elect to receive an income that's guaranteed to last as long as you live. And
although
LifeStages<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> is designed as a longer-term
investment, there
are other
ways to access your money without incurring surrender charges.<SUP><FONT
SIZE="-1"><A HREF="#2">2</A></FONT></SUP> Withdrawals prior to age 59 1/2 may be
subject to a
10% IRS tax penalty.
<P>
<STRONG>Windows of Opportunity</STRONG><BR>
LifeStages' 10% Window allows immediate access
to
10% of your policy's cash value each year (less any surrender-charge-free
withdrawals you've
made
during the year) without triggering a surrender charge.<P>
In addition, LifeStages<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> offers a Gain Window
for policies
with $100,000 or more in accumulated premium payments.  Without incurring
surrender
charges,
you
can withdraw the greater of all of the gain in your policy or the 10% Window
amount.
<P>
<STRONG>Loan Option for TSAs</STRONG><BR>
If you're investing through a Tax Sheltered Annuity (TSA) program only,
LifeStages offers liquidity through a TSA loan provision.  Loans may
equal the
lesser of 50% of the value of your policy or $50,000. 
<P>
<STRONG>Guaranteed Refund of Initial Premium on Fixed Account</STRONG><BR>
If you surrender your policy during the first three years, you're guaranteed to
receive the
portion of the
initial premium you allocated to, and that remained in, the Fixed Account. This
refund does
not apply if
any partial withdrawals are taken 
from the policy, such as the 10% Window or the Gain Window.
<P>
<STRONG>Guaranteed Advantages For Your Heirs</STRONG><BR>
To help you provide for your heirs, LifeStages<FONT
SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT>
offers a
death benefit equal to the greater of the cash value or the premiums paid less
withdrawals. 
In other
words, your heirs will receive at least the amount of money you've invested -
even
if your
accounts have
declined in value.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A
HREF="#3">3</A></FONT></SUP>
<P>
There's even a three-year step-up<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A
HREF="#4">4</A></FONT></SUP> feature that offers even more protection.  Every
three
years,
your
death benefit "locks in" so your beneficiary is guaranteed the greater of the
current cash
value or
premiums paid less withdrawals or the cash value at each third-year anniversary
(plus any
premiums
paid less any withdrawals and surrender charges since the last third-year
anniversary).  This
enables
you to lock in new, higher levels of guarantees in a growing market. This
step-up
feature
continues until
the owner or annuitant reaches insurance age 85.
<P>

<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A NAME="1">1</A></FONT></SUP> Transfers
from
the
Fixed Account to Investment Divisions are subject to some restrictions.  See the
prospectus
for details. 
Subject to contract limitations, you are permitted twelve free transfers per
year. 
NYLIAC
reserves the
right to charge up to $30 for each transfer exceeding twelve per year.  This
offer
may be
modified or
withdrawn at any time.</FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A NAME="2">2</A></FONT></SUP>
LifeStages<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> surrender charges are based on
the
date of
each premium payment as follows:  7% in years one through three; 6% in year
four;
5% in year
five and
4% in year six. For residents of Oregon - after ten years, surrender charges
will
never be
more than 1%
of the policy cash value.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A NAME="3">3</A></FONT></SUP> Death
benefit
payments are dependent upon the claims-paying ability of NYLIAC.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A NAME="4">4</A></FONT></SUP> For

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Long-Term Care: What You Need To Know</STRONG></FONT><P>

<P>
Consumers are increasingly becoming aware that sound retirement
planning must take into account the need for and cost of long-term
care services, and for good reason. Studies show that 60% of the
people who reach age 65 will need long-term care services<SUP><A HREF="pfrprilt.html#1">1</A></SUP> during
their lifetime, with 40% requiring a stay in a nursing home<SUP><A HREF="pfrprilt.html#2">2</A></SUP>. 
As people live longer, those odds will increase.  <BR>

<P>
<STRONG>Changing Times Bring New Concerns</STRONG>
<BR>
Most of us know at least one person who has stayed in a nursing
home or needed professional home health care.  The financial consequences
of long-term health care can have a significant impact on a family's
savings and lifestyle.  According to the <I>Health Care Financing
Administration (Fall 1992)</I>, over 56% of long-term home health
care expenses are paid, out-of-pocket, by the patients and their
families.  Those accumulated expenses can use up a major part
of your savings.  For people who enter a nursing home, the financial
outcome can be worse: according to the Congressional Subcommittee
on Aging, <I>70 to 80% of nursing home residents deplete their
assets within twelve months</I>.  <BR>

<P>
To understand this increasing need to plan for the financial impact
of long-term care services, it's necessary to understand basic
changes taking place in American society.  According to the U.S.
Census, there were 32 million people age 65 and older in 1990-but
by the year 2030, this figure could double to 64.6 million.  Moreover,
people are living longer today than ever before.  By the year
2040, there may be more people over age 85 than there are over
65 today.  Not only are we getting older but, over the next 50
years, working age population may increase only 2 to 18%, while
the elderly population is expected to increase anywhere from 139
to 169%.  <BR>

<P>
For years, it was tradition for adult children to take care of
their parents during the &quot;golden years&quot;.  But changing
times have brought an increase in dual-career families, job insecurity,
family mobility, and divorce.  Today, many adult children are
not able to stay home and look after their own children, let alone
an aging parent.  In addition, corporate downsizing has eliminated
thousands of mid-management jobs throughout the country; consequently,
many adult children are not in a position to financially help
their parents as they had planned.  Add to this the increasing
uncertainty of health care benefits for senior citizens, and a
giant question mark looms on the horizon.<BR>

<P>
<STRONG>Who Will Pay For Long-Term Care?  Not Uncle Sam.</STRONG>
<BR>
Who will support this population and help pay its inevitable medical
bills?  The writing is on the wall.  According to Alice M. Rivlin
and Joshua M. Weiner, authors of <I>Caring for the Disabled Elderly</I>
(published by the Brookings Institution), the combination of aging
Baby Boomers and an increase in the longevity of the aged will
dramatically heighten the need for more public and private spending.
 But when it comes time to pay the bill, no federal programs-Social
Security, Medicare, or Medicaid will pay for all long-term care
expenses.  <BR>

<P>
<STRONG>How &quot;Secure&quot; Is Social Security?</STRONG>
<BR>
Social Security is not a savings account that builds up over time.
 It is a &quot;pay as you go&quot; system, paid for through payroll
taxes on present employees to support former workers.  Today,
according to the Social Security Administration, each retired
Social Security beneficiary is supported by the payroll taxes
of 3.3 workers.  By 2020, it's estimated that each Social Security
beneficiary will be supported by the payroll taxes of 1.9 workers.
 According to the Social Security system, payroll taxes would
have to increase by almost 60% for the system to remain solvent
and provide the same level of benefits in the future.  <BR>

<P>
<STRONG>Don't Bank On Medicare Or Medicaid</STRONG>
<BR>
Although Medicare provides health coverage for senior citizens,
it is limited in the area of long-term care coverage.  In 1992,
Medicare paid a total of 4.3% of all nursing home care expenses
in the country, and 9.5% of long-term home health care expenses<SUP><A HREF="pfrprilt.html#3">3</A></SUP>,
primarily for nursing home and home health care services immediately
following a hospital stay.   Medicare generally will not cover
the cost of nursing home or home health care services due to a
chronic condition.  Medicaid, on the other hand, will cover the
cost of long-term care, but there's one catch: to qualify, you
must become indigent (&quot;spend down&quot; your assets).  Remember:
once you have depleted your assets, you have also lost control
over where and when you receive care.  Also, because of state
and federal budget cutbacks, the facilities close to your family
and friends might not have openings for Medicaid patients at the
time you need care.<BR>

<P>
<STRONG>What are the options?</STRONG>
<BR>
If  Medicare won't pay, and spending down your assets to qualify
for Medicaid is not attractive, the cost of any required long-term care services may be paid for out of current income and savings,
as by long-term care insurance.  And, long-term care can be very
expensive.  In 1994, nursing  home care averaged $36,000 per year
nationally<SUP><A HREF="pfrprilt.html#4">4</A></SUP>, but costs substantially more in some states.
 Home care usually is less expensive, but full-time home care
can cost as much as a nursing home stay.<BR>

<P>
<STRONG>What Does Long-Term Care Insurance Cover?</STRONG>
<BR>
Long-term care insurance usually pays for skilled, intermediate,
or custodial care in a nursing home.  It can also cover professional
&quot;at-home&quot; health care.  This type of insurance can help
pay for a variety of home and community-based care services, including:
physical, speech, and occupational therapists; home health aides
and visiting nurses; adult day care, and hospice care.  (Note:
Generally, <I>skilled care</I> refers to round-the-clock treatment
by a registered nurse under a doctor's supervision. <I> Intermediate
care</I> refers to occasional nursing and rehabilitative care
under the supervision of skilled medical personnel.  <I>Custodial
care</I> primarily meets personal care needs in activities of
daily living such as help in eating or bathing.) Typically, long-term
care insurance policies pay up to a specific dollar amount day
(which may be less than the total cost of the services provided).
 Few, if any, policies provide full coverage for all expenses.
<BR>

<P>
<STRONG>More Information is Available</STRONG>
<BR>
HIAA publishes a booklet, &quot;The Consumer's Guide To Long-Term
Care Insurance,&quot; which provides basic information on long-term
care and long-term care insurance. Long-term care insurance may
not be for everybody, so it is important to research the subject
carefully.  Your agent can help you make an educated decision.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Message to Policyowners</STRONG></FONT><P>


Every child is born with the right to dream, and hopefully, they'll go as far as their 
dreams will take them.  But, wherever they go and whatever they dream, New York Life will be 
there -- just as it has been for the last seven generations.
<P>

	When we began in 1845, we were a small company located in New York City doing business in
the
eastern part of the United States.  Today, 150 years later, we are a $74 billion financial services
organization with interests that span the globe.  We have locations in thousands of towns and cities
across the country and throughout the world.  
<P>

	As a world leader in the financial services field, we touch the lives of millions of Americans -- and
others around the world -- through diversified investments and a wide range of services.  Our clients include 
such large organizations as the American Veterinary Medical Association and the Minor League Baseball Insurance Trust
for players and umpires, as well as you, your family, your neighbors, and friends.
<P> 
	Our greatest accomplishments during our sesquicentennial were a natural outgrowth of 150 years
of
dedicated, continuous service to our customers.  We set ambitious financial goals -- and exceeded
them, created new products to meet your changing needs, and enhanced our leadership position as
a company that protects policyowners' interests.<P>
	Through our financial products, managed health care, and invested assets, we help shape the
future
for millions of men and women.  Our size and diversity are part of what keeps us financially strong. 
Proof of this statement can be found in our 1995 financial results.  Our sales -- generally annualized
insurance premiums and new money from investment products -- increased 13 percent from 1994; our
consolidated assets reached $74.3 billion; our net gain was $373 million; our surplus and investment
reserves totaled $5.2 billion; and the ratio of surplus to assets, a key measure of strength, was a solid
6.95 percent -- one of the highest among major life insurers.  Remaining strong enables us to help you reach your 
financial goals.  It's a strategy we intend to keep for the next 150 years.  And those years promise to be even more 
dynamic -- and successful -- than the last.
<P>
	Adding new products also helps us to meet your goals.  While industry growth remained sluggish, the introduction
of new products and plans helped our individual insurance and annuity sales climb 24 percent from 1994.  We're
pleased at this tremendous vote of consumer confidence in our agents, brokerage producers, products, and 
quality of service.
<P>
	One new product, our LifeStages<FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> variable annuity, contributed to a record-breaking
year for the Individual Annuity line of business -- resulting in nearly $1.4 billion in sales.  Our
revitalized Agency Force alone sold 34 percent more annuity business in 1995 than the year before.  And, our
Five-Year Term policy contributed significantly to our more than $70 million in new term premium -- one of our
best years ever for this traditional product.
<P>
Another important move was the  reorganization of our managed care operations to form NYLCare
Health Plans, Inc.  We merged our Group insurance operations with one of our most  profitable and
fastest-growing subsidiaries, Sanus Corp. Health Systems, an HMO and managed care organization. 
This enhanced the quality of our operations and service, and simplified the way the
organizations and individuals can purchase and manage their health care benefits.  NYLCare, which
estimates its 1996 revenues will reach $2.5 billion, now offers a full spectrum of health care
products and services, including group insurance, preferred provider organizations, and HMO
products.<P>

	In 1995, we also became a major direct marketer of life insurance as the provider for the AARP Life
Insurance Program.  Chosen by the American Association of Retired Persons after a rigorous selection
process, we began offering the program to AARP members in the fall of 1994, and the response was
overwhelming.  In 1995, sales reached $53 million, exceeding our initial estimates by a wide
margin.<P>
	Our MainStay<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Funds set records for sales and surpassed the $6 billion asset mark in 1995.  We can
credit this success to outstanding equity performance, as well as the efforts of both of our distribution
channels -- the New York Life Agency Force and Wall Street brokerage firms.  On the pension side, our
traditional Guaranteed Investment Contract (GIC) product continued to provide retirement security for
our clients as we maintained our market leadership position.
<P>
	One of our strongest assets is integrity.  It's been a hallmark of our Company for 150 years.  A
prime example of our belief in the integrity of our people, our products, and our promises was the 
settlement in 1995 of a class action lawsuit brought on behalf of certain policyowners.  It involved sales practice
issues and in particular, policyowners' understanding of dividends and interest crediting rates. 
<P>
	The Company's financial strength and our confidence in our agents allowed us to work out an innovative settlement,
approved by the Supreme Court of New York State in January 1996.  It was high in benefits and aid to policyowners 
in the class, while doing nothing to disadvantage our other policyowners.  In fact, over 99 percent of the
policyowners in the class have elected to accept the settlement, attesting to its fairness.
<P>
	Our great financial strength, coupled with our leadership position on issues of integrity 
which affect our policyowners, is reflected on many levels.  A <EM>Fortune</EM> 100 company overall, New York Life 
now ranks fourth in the insurance industry on the basis of assets and revenues, and in life insurance sales.  And, once
again, New York Life and its subsidiary, New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation (NYLIAC), have received
high marks from the major ratings agencies.  For claims-paying ability, both Standard &amp; Poor's and Duff &amp; Phelps
assign us AAA, their highest ratings.  For financial strength, A.M. Best gives us an A++, its second highest classification, 
and Moody's Investors Service gives us Aa1, its second highest 
of 19 possible ratings.
<P>
	Our consistently high ratings are further proof that we keep the needs of our policyowners at the 
forefront of every decision we make.  Our financial strength will enable us to pay out $1.2 billion in dividends
in 1996, the highest amount in New York Life's history.
<P>
	1995 was also a year of change for our Board.  President George Bundschuh took a long-planned early retirement 
on October 1, 1995.  George's New York Life career spanned 36 years, and he was a valued member of both our 
Board and our Company.  He will be missed for his intellect and vision.
<P>
	As chairman, I will especially miss George.  We worked closely on many issues and his advice was always invaluable.  
It was imperative that his replacement also be an  innovative leader who believes in the New York Life commitment 
to provide quality sevice and sound financial management.
<P>
	For that reason, it gives me great pleasure to have Sy Sternberg as my co-signer on this letter, having succeeded George
	as president.  Sy joined 
New York Life in 1989 as head of Group operations.  With his steady leadership and innovative thinking, this 
area became a major player in the health care arena, culminating in the creation of NYLCare.  Now, as president and chief 
operating officer, Sy has all of the business operations of the Company reporting to him.  He is the vice chairman of two
Board committees: Executive  &amp; Insurance and Investment.
<P>
	We also welcomed three new Board members and were heartened by the recent return of a former Director. Our new members
are Robert Baylis, former vice chairman of CS First Boston, Inc., who is a member of the Investment Committee; Kent Foster, the president of GTE Corporation, who is a member of the Executive &amp; Insurance Committee; and 
Leslie McCraw, the chairman and chief executive officer of Fluor Corporation, who also serves on the Investment Committee.
Conrad Harper, a partner at the law firm of Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett, left the Board three years ago to serve as
a legal adviser to the Department of State and as a member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague.  He
rejoined the Board in 1996.  Mr. Harper is a member of the Executive &amp; Insurance Committee.  We should benefit 
greatly from the insight and years of experience each man brings to the Company.
<P>
	We want to take the opportunity of this letter to reaffirm the Company's traditional promises to you: to remain 
strong; to take every opportunity for prudent, managed growth; and above all, to be here for you when you need us.   When
you dream a world -- for yourself or your children -- you may not hear our name or see our buildings, but we are there.<P>
We always will be.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Modified Premium Whole Life</STRONG></FONT><P>

Modified Premium Whole Life (MPWL) is a permanent, participating life insurance
policy that
features a
lower initial premium that remains level for the policy's first five years, then
increases to
its ultimate
premium in year six, and remains at that level for life. It is best suited for
established
individuals
seeking a large amount of insurance and moderate cash value accumulation at a
reduced
premium.  
<P>
<STRONG>The Benefits of Modified Premium Whole Life</STRONG><BR>
<UL>
	<LI>Provides permanent life insurance protection.
	<LI>Premiums are lower in the first five years.
	<LI>Accumulates tax-deferred, guaranteed cash value.
	<LI>Loan provision allows you to borrow from cash value.
	<LI>Eligible for dividends, if and when declared by the Company.
	<LI>Death benefit may increase annually with paid-up additions purchased from
dividends.
	<LI>Death benefit, in most instances, is free from federal income tax.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Uses of MPWL</STRONG><BR>
Individual - MPWL can be an effective method of protecting your family's assets.
Some
potential uses
include:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI><STRONG>Traditional Insurance Protection</STRONG> - Provides the
financial
security
that
gives families the
peace of mind they deserve.
	<LI><STRONG>Mortgage Protection</STRONG> - Can help pay off mortgages and
other
outstanding
debts in the event
of a premature death.
	<LI><STRONG>Retirement Funding</STRONG> - Over the long-term, accumulated
cash
value can
be accessed through
policy loans to help fund a comfortable retirement.
	<LI><STRONG>Education Funding</STRONG> - Can help pay for children's and
grandchildren's
education through
policy loans, or as named beneficiaries.
	<LI><STRONG>Pension Maximization</STRONG> - A possible solution to the
pension
dilemma,
whereby a "single-life"
pension option is chosen and life insurance proceeds are earmarked to replace the
lost
pension
benefit in the event of pensioner's death.
	<LI><STRONG>Estate Planning Tool</STRONG> - Can be an effective way of
providing funds
for
estate expenses, and
helping to avoid the sale of assets and/or the need to borrow. 
	<LI><STRONG>Charitable Giving</STRONG> - Bequesting life insurance to make a
larger
donation
to your favorite
charity.
</UL>
<P>
Business - MPWL can play many vital roles in the smooth operation of a business. It

used as
an attractive employee benefit, and as a means to assure the business's financial
future.
Below are
some examples of its use:
<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI><STRONG>Split Dollar Arrangement </STRONG>- Employee is covered by an
insurance
policy
while premiums are
paid by the employer. The employer owns the policy, but the employee can name the
beneficiary. Upon
the death of the employee, the employer receives proceeds equal to the cash value
of the
policy, while
the beneficiary receives the remaining proceeds.
	<LI><STRONG>Group Equity Carve Out</STRONG> - Offers employers the
opportunity
to
provide
permanent, cash value
life insurance to select employees, while keeping the costs low.
	<LI><STRONG>Deferred Compensation</STRONG> - Offers employers the
opportunity
to provide
benefits to employees
at a later date, such as at retirement.
	<LI><STRONG>Salary Continuation</STRONG> - Offers employees supplemental
retirement and
death benefits.
	<LI><STRONG>Buy/Sell Agreement </STRONG>- Funding a buy/sell agreement
through
life
insurance can be the smart
choice for protecting your business's assets.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Good Corporate Citizen</STRONG></FONT><P>
The Company's commitment to helping communities in which it does business can be traced back
to
1853 when it made its first contribution -- assisting the victims of yellow fever in New
Orleans.<P>
The Company's first formal contributions budget was established in 1951.  Since then, the
Company and, subsequently, the New York Life Foundation -- which was created in 1979 and is
now the Company's main vehicle for charitable giving -- have contributed more than $63 million
to a variety of national and local organizations across the country.  Today, the New York
Life Foundation supports a wide range of health and human service agencies, educational
institutions, arts and cultural groups, as well as civic and community organizations. 
Periodically, the Foundation selects areas of special focus within one or more of these
categories.  Its current priority areas are AIDS and literacy.<P>
The Foundation makes annual grants to more than 150 United Ways across the country in cities
where New York Life offices are located.  In 1995, recipients of other major grants included
the National AIDS Fund, Literacy Volunteers of America, the Life and Health Insurance Medical
Research Fund, Black Leadership Commission on AIDS, and Literacy Volunteers of New York
City.<P>
New York Life doesn't view its contributions program as one that "gives away" money.  Grants
are made as investments in organizations whose work enhances the quality of life of the
people they serve, thus ensuring a better future for society as a whole.<P>

Frequently, the Foundation is able to combine its financial support with the Company's
greatest asset -- the talent and expertise of its people.  For example, the Foundation for
Independent Higher Education (FIHE), which represents 600 independent colleges across the
country through its 38 state and regional associations, has received more than $5.2
million in grants.  In many instances, this support has been coupled with the involvement of
Company officers, managing partners, and agents in both the national and local FIHE
organizations.<P>
Whether it's through the Foundation's matching gift program for colleges and universities, or
its Local Volunteer Action Program, which makes grants to community groups where New York
Life employees and agents volunteer their time, the New York Life family consistently
demonstrates its commitment to community participation.

<STRONG>Plan for Your Retirement with NYLIAC Variable Annuity</STRONG>
<P>




Retirement - spending time with family and friends, traveling, doing things you
didn't have a chance to do while you were working.<P>
But what if you're ready to retire and your finances won't let you? Will you be able to
afford a comfortable
standard of living without the security of your paycheck? <P>
NYLIAC Variable Annuity can help you prepare for the type of retirement you've always
dreamed
of. With
its tax-deferred growth,  variety of investment options and professional fund managers,
NYLIAC
Variable Annuity might be just what you're looking for.  It can even help provide you
with an
income for
the rest of your life.<P>
When you're planning for retirement, you need all the help you can get. Since earnings
grow
tax-deferred in NYLIAC Variable Annuity, your money may accumulate faster than it would
in a
similar
but taxable investment.<P>
Your needs and goals are unique, and are likely to change throughout your lifetime. With
NYLIAC
Variable Annuity, you have the option of choosing from a variety of investment divisions
that have
varying levels of risk. You also have the option of a Fixed Account with a guaranteed
interest rate.
Managing your money can be extremely time consuming. It can also be difficult keeping
track
of market
changes and interest rate fluctuations. With NYLIAC Variable Annuity, you can leave the
investing to
professionals. Fund managers with proven track records manage the portfolios.<P>
NYLIAC Variable Annuity is issued by New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation
(NYLIAC), a
wholly owned subsidiary of New York Life Insurance Company and available through NYLIFE
Securities Inc. (member NASD) 51 Madison Avenue, NY NY 10010.<P>

<STRONG>Benefits of Tax Deferral</STRONG><BR>
Earnings in NYLIAC Variable Annuity accumulate tax-deferred. In other words, you won't
pay
taxes on
your earnings until you decide to withdraw them. So, not only can your earnings compound
year
after
year, but they also remain untouched by taxes until withdrawal. This could translate into
extra dollars in
the long run. (Remember, withdrawals prior to age 59 1/2 may be subject to a 10% IRS
penalty.)
<P>
<STRONG>Controlling Your Taxes</STRONG><BR>
Since tax-deferral means that you won't be taxed until you withdraw your money, NYLIAC
Variable
Annuity can actually help you control your taxes. By planning your withdrawals, you can
spread out your
tax liability so you are not pushed into a higher bracket. 
NYLIAC Variable Annuity can offer you the opportunity to better control taxes. It can
help
your money
accumulate faster - and last longer.
<P>
<STRONG>Flexibility</STRONG>
<BR>
With NYLIAC Variable Annuity you design an investment portfolio that is right for you.
Based
on your
objectives and risk tolerance, you can select among a variety of investment options,
including stock,
bond, international equity and a fixed account. The Fixed Account has an interest rate
that
is periodically
set and guaranteed by NYLIAC.<P>
Because your needs and objectives may change, you can redesign your portfolio by making
tax-free
transfers among investment options. It's even easier when you use NYLIAC's toll-free
telephone
number.
<P>


<STRONG>Professional Management</STRONG><BR>
Although you choose the investment divisions for your policy, professional fund managers
at
MacKay
Shields Financial Corporation, Monitor Capital Advisors, Inc., Calvert Asset Management
Company,
Inc., and New York Life are responsible for managing the underlying portfolios of the
investment
divisions. Each portfolio is managed by experienced financial advisors who have proven
track
records
in investment management.
<P>
<STRONG>Dollar Cost Averaging</STRONG><BR>
Don't you wish you could predict the highs and lows of the market? Then you would be able
to
buy when
prices were low and sell when prices were high. But who has a crystal ball? <P>
You can avoid a lot of the guesswork if you dollar cost average. With dollar cost
averaging,
you set up a
program of scheduled investments - given dollar amounts invested at given points in time
-
and stick
to it, regardless of the changes in the markets. This consistent, disciplined approach
allows
you to take
advantage of market volatility by buying more investment units when prices are low and
fewer
when
prices are high. Although dollar cost averaging does not ensure a profit nor protect
against
a loss in a
declining market, over time a sustained dollar cost averaging strategy can reduce your
timing
risk and
optimize your return. Investors should consider their financial ability to continue
purchases
through
periods of low and high price levels.<P>
Dollar cost averaging is easy with NYLIAC Variable Annuity. Just select the automated
Dollar
Cost
Averaging feature, tell us how much to invest and how often, and we'll do the rest. 
<P>
<STRONG>Automatic Asset Reallocation</STRONG><BR>
You might want to maintain a particular allocation of your assets among certain
investment
divisions,
for example, keeping 30% in Bond, 30% in Capital Appreciation and 40% in International
Equity. Since
portfolio values change at different rates, you may need to move money between investment
divisions to
keep your desired ratio. It's a popular investment strategy - but it requires a lot of
maintenance.
<P>Fortunately, NYLIAC Variable Annuity offers an Automatic Asset Reallocation feature
that
allows
you to specify when - quarterly, semi-annually, or annually - NYLIAC will review your
accounts and
automatically make any necessary transfers to bring your distribution back into the
balance
you
selected.
<P>
<STRONG>Payout at Retirement</STRONG><BR>
With NYLIAC Variable Annuity you choose how you want to receive your retirement income.
Several
options include a guaranteed income that will last as long as you live. 
<P>
<STRONG>Withdrawals</STRONG><BR>
You may make withdrawals from your policy at any time, and NYLIAC Variable Annuity
features
attractive
withdrawal options.<P>
NYLIAC Variable Annuity's 10% Window allows you to withdraw 10% of your policy's cash
value
each policy year (less any surrender-charge-free withdrawals you made during the year)
without incurring surrender charges. And, if your policy has $100,000 or more in
accumulated
premium payments, you can withdraw the greater of: the gain in your policy, or the 10%
Window
amount, without incurring surrender charges. Certain withdrawals prior to age 59 1/2 may
be
subject to a 10% IRS penalty.
<P>
<STRONG>Loan Option for TSA Plans</STRONG><BR>
If you are investing in a NYLIAC Variable Annuity through a Tax Sheltered Annuity (TSA)
program at work,
there are certain loan provisions available. The loan options are available in TSAs only.
<P>
<STRONG>Protection for Your Heirs</STRONG><BR>
With NYLIAC Variable Annuity your heirs are guaranteed to receive the greater of the cash
value of your
policy, or any premiums paid less withdrawals. This means that even if the value of your
portfolio has
decreased, your heirs are guaranteed to receive at least the amount of money that you had
invested
(less any withdrawals and taxes, of course). NYLIAC guarantees it!
<P>
Request a NYLIAC prospectus package for more complete information including fees and
expenses.
Read it carefully for complete information on all product features before you invest or
send
money.<P>
The value of your investment, including the return of your principal, is subject to
market
risk.<P>

<STRONG>Indexed Equity</STRONG><BR>
The Indexed Equity Portfolio invests in the stocks represented in the Standard
&amp;
Poor's 500
Composite
Price Index (S&amp;P 500)<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A
HREF="#1">1</A></FONT></SUP>. By
investing in
the same stocks, and in the same proportion as the S&amp;P 500,
the portfolio seeks to achieve investment results that correspond to the total
return of the
stock market
as represented by the S&amp;P 500. This investment option may be right for you
if you
are willing
to bear the
risks associated with the stock market in exchange for a return that may mirror
the
market's<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="#2">2</A></FONT></SUP>. (Managed

Advisors, Inc.)
<P>
<STRONG>Growth Equity</STRONG><BR>
The Growth Equity Portfolio invests principally in common stock of
well-established,
well-managed
companies. These stocks may have the potential for above-average growth. This
portfolio seeks
long-term growth of capital, with dividend income secondary to its objective.
Consider this
investment
alternative if you want the opportunity for above-average capital growth, while
accepting the
risks
associated with the stock market. (Managed by New York Life Insurance Co.)
<P>
<STRONG>Capital Appreciation</STRONG><BR>
The Capital Appreciation Portfolio seeks long-term growth of capital. Stocks
expected to
appreciate in
value are selected for this portfolio. Dividend income, if any, is incidental
to
this
portfolio's objective.
This investment option may suit you if you are willing to assume greater risk
for a
potentially greater
return on your investment.  (Managed by MacKay-Shields Financial Corporation)
<P>
<STRONG>High Yield Corporate Bond</STRONG><BR>
The High Yield Corporate Bond Portfolio seeks to maximize current income and
secondarily
seeks
growth from capital appreciation. It invests in high yield debt securities that
are often
rated in the
lower categories by the rating agencies. These securities are commonly referred
to
as high
yield
securities or junk bonds. This portfolio may be appropriate if you are seeking
a
high
potential return and
are willing to assume greater risk. (Managed by MacKay-Shields Financial
Corporation) 
<P>
<STRONG>International Equity</STRONG><BR>
The International Equity Portfolio seeks long-term growth of capital. It
invests in
a
portfolio of primarily
non-U.S. equity securities. The portfolio tries to diversify across a variety
of
countries
and will be
invested in a minimum of five countries, exclusive of the United States.
Consider
this
investment option
if you wish to diversify by including non-U.S. investments in your portfolio
and if
you are
willing to
assume the risks associated with international investing<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A

SIZE="-1">SM</FONT></SUP>: Moderate Investment Options</STRONG></FONT><P>


<STRONG>Government</STRONG><BR>
The Government Portfolio seeks a high level of current income consistent with
safety of
principal. It
invests primarily in U.S. Government securities, including Treasury bills, notes,
and bonds,
and
obligations of the U.S. Government or its agencies. Although the securities held
within this
portfolio are
guaranteed by the U.S. Government or an agency, the value of the portfolio's shares
is not
insured and
will fluctuate. Choose this investment alternative if you seek a conservative
investment with
relatively low
risk. (Managed by MacKay-Shields Financial Corporation)
<P>

<STRONG>Bond</STRONG><BR>
The Bond Portfolio invests primarily in investment grade, fixed-income securities
including
U.S.
Government bonds, U.S. Government agency obligations and corporate bonds. This fund
may also
invest in lower-rated securities, convertible debt, and preferred stock. By
investing in
various grades of
debt securities, this portfolio seeks to earn long-term income while preserving
capital. You
should
consider this investment option if you want a relatively conservative approach to
income and
capital
preservation and are willing to accept some market risk. (Managed by New York Life
Insurance
Company)
<P>
<STRONG>Total Return</STRONG><BR>
The Total Return Portfolio seeks to realize current income consistent with
reasonable
opportunity for
future growth of capital and income. It invests in a combination of stocks, bonds,
or money
market
instruments, depending on market conditions. By investing in a broad range of
securities,
this portfolio
seeks to reduce the risks associated with market volatility. This investment
alternative may
be right for
you if you want the opportunity for attractive growth and income while accepting
some risk
exposure.
(Managed by MacKay-Shields Financial Corporation)
<P>
<STRONG>Value</STRONG><BR>
The Value Portfolio seeks to realize maximum long-term total return from a
combination of
capital
growth and income investments. It invests in common stocks that are, in the
portfolio
manager's
opinion, undervalued at the time of purchase. The portfolio typically invests in
dividend-paying stocks,
but will also invest in non-dividend paying stocks. This portfolio may be right for
you if
you are seeking
an equity investment that focuses on growth from both capital appreciation and
dividend
income, and if
you are willing to assume the associated risks. (Managed by MacKay-Shields
Financial
Corporation)
<P>
<STRONG>Socially Responsible</STRONG><BR>
The Socially Responsible Portfolio seeks capital growth through investment in
enterprises
that make a
significant contribution to society through their products, services, and the way
they do
business. The
portfolio seeks to achieve a total return above the rate of inflation through an
actively
managed portfolio
of stocks and bonds of socially responsible companies plus money market
instruments. You
should
consider this investment option if you are seeking growth which may outpace
inflation and if
you prefer
to invest in companies that show a concern for social issues. The Socially
Responsible
Portfolio is not
a portfolio of the MFA Series Fund, Inc. (Managed by Calvert Asset Management
Company,
Inc.)<P>

<STRONG>NYLIAC's Variable Universal Life Insurance</STRONG> 
<P>




<STRONG>Protection Plus Investment Opportunity</STRONG><BR>
All life insurance offers financial protection.  And all permanent life insurance generates a
cash value
that you can use to finance personal goals.  But there's one thing most life insurance plans
don't offer:
choice in how your money is invested.  New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation
(NYLIAC)
offers a plan that does: Variable Universal Life (VUL).<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A
HREF="#1">1</A></FONT></SUP>
<P>
Variable Universal Life puts you in control of your life insurance.  You can adjust your
payments to suit
your
changing needs. 
And you can even decide how your dollars will be invested - which means you have a say in how
your
money may grow.  Few traditional life insurance plans offer this kind of freedom.  With VUL,
you get both
the protection of life insurance and the potential for growth of investments.
<P>

<STRONG>Flexible Protection and Flexible Payments</STRONG><BR>
With NYLIAC's Variable Universal Life, you have the freedom to choose the amount of life
insurance
protection that best suits you.  As your needs change, you have the option of increasing or
decreasing
your coverage.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A
HREF="#2">2</A></FONT></SUP> You can also control the
amount and frequency of your payments.  For example, if you're looking to accumulate as much
as you
can for the future, you can make a lump-sum contribution or increase your payments.  That
extra money
can help increase the cash value of your policy, so when a personal or business opportunity
presents
itself, you'll have access to those funds.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A
HREF="#3">3</A></FONT></SUP>
Or if you need to temporarily cut back on your payments, you
may be able to pay less premium than usual and let the policy's accumulated cash value cover
the rest. 
Flexible payments let you make the choices.
<P>

<STRONG>Flexible Investment Features</STRONG><BR>
With Variable Universal Life, you control how your money works for you.  You can choose among
several
funding
options, including stock, bond, balanced, or money-market accounts.  There's also a Fixed
Account with
a minimum guaranteed rate of 4%.
<P>
By contributing at regular intervals through "dollar cost averaging," you may get a lower
overall cost on
the units in which you're investing, without having to time the financial markets.<SUP><FONT
SIZE="-1"><A HREF="#4">4</A></FONT></SUP> What's more, you're never locked into your
investment choices - you can change them.  You can also secure any gains you may make by
transferring them into the Cash Management portfolio or, on a limited basis, the Fixed
Account.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="#5">5</A></FONT></SUP>  Those earnings can then
remain there tax-deferred.  Whatever options you select, you control the investment choice.
<P>

<STRONG>Customized Policy Design</STRONG><BR>
You can customize Variable Universal Life to fit your lifestyle.  Ask your NYLIFE Securities
registered
representative how you can add different policy features that can help you provide financial
protection
for your spouse and children, keep the policy in force during disability, increase the
benefit if you die
accidentally, or tailor the plan to cover other needs.
<P>

<STRONG>Earnings That Grow Tax-Deferred</STRONG><BR>
Earnings on VUL grow tax-deferred and are re-invested, so your money may grow a lot faster
than it
would in a taxable investment.  And don't forget the benefits of compounding: earnings may
grow year
after year - tax-deferred - and this could magnify your ultimate return!

<P>
<STRONG>Reliable, Professional Management</STRONG><BR>
The professional fund managers at MacKay-Shields Financial Corporation Financial Corporation
and
Monitor Capital
Advisors, Inc. manage VUL's portfolio accounts.  Both are New York Life affiliates and are
premier
financial advisors with proven track records in investment management.  The Fixed Account is
managed by NYLIAC - and backed by this New York Life subsidiary's superior financial strength
and
stability.

<P>
<STRONG>At Your Service</STRONG><BR>
Your NYLIFE Securities registered representative is always ready to help you and answer any
questions. 
You can call a
toll-free number to transfer funds between accounts or get up-to-the-minute information about
your
policy. 
You'll also receive quarterly statements to give you a summary of your policy activity.

<P>

For more complete information, including charges and expenses, contact your NYLIFE Securities
registered
representative for a free
NYLIAC Variable Universal Life prospectus package. 
Read it carefully before you invest or send money. <P>

Neither New York Life nor the New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation guarantees the
investment
performance of the variable accounts, which will fluctuate with market conditions.

number is 793-90.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><A NAME="2">2</A></SUP> To increase your coverage, you may
need to produce satisfactory evidence of insurability.  Also, you will
need to meet any other applicable underwriting requirements.  Increases and decreases in your

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>New York Life Worldwide Holding, Inc.</STRONG></FONT><P>

In 1995, New York Life Worldwide Holding, Inc., continued to grow its international insurance 
operations, with sales of $58.1 million.  In Argentina, La Buenos Airs - New York Life 
Seguros de Vida S.A. now ranks number two in life insurance sales; in 
Indonesia, P.T. Asuransi Jiwa Sewu - New York Life climbed to number five.
<P>
The Taiwan, South Korea, and Mexico operations exceeded 1995 sales objectives, while aggressive 
recruiting by our subsidiary in Hong Kong resulted in the doubling of its Agency Force.  In
addition, our new international brokerage subsidiary, New York Life Worldwide (Bermuda) Ltd.,
appointed more than 20 gereral agents, which will increase its productivity.
<P>
Our involvement in the United Kingdom insurance market, through the Life Assurance 
Holding Corporation Limited, continues to focus on the acquisition and management of existing 
insurance companies and their portfolios.  And, in mainland China, we received governmental approval 
to open a second representative office.

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Notes to Financial Statements for Annual Report</B></FONT><P>



<STRONG>Note A:</STRONG>  The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the consolidation of New York Life Insurance Company (NYLIC) with its direct, wholly owned life insurance subsidiaries:  New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation (NYLIAC), New York Life and Health Insurance Company (NYLHIC), and NYLIFE Insurance Company of Arizona (NYLAZ).  NYLIC and such subsidiaries are hereinafter referred to collectively as "the Company".   Separate unconsolidated financial statements are shown for NYLIC and NYLIAC.  All significant intercompany transactions, primarily the net equity of the insurance subsidiaries, have been eliminated in consolidation.  Other subsidiaries are recorded at their underlying net equity, with the exception of NYLIC's investment in Express Scripts, Inc., a 69% owned subsidiary, which is carried at market value as allowed under New York State law.<P>

<P>NYLIC is a diversified financial services company which offers a wide range of insurance and investment products and services, including life and health insurance, pension products, mutual funds (through its broker-dealer subsidiary), and other investments, to a large cross section of the total insurance market.  NYLIAC offers a wide variety of interest sensitive insurance and annuity products.  Effective January 1, 1996, NYLIC merged its Health Maintenance Organization subsidiary, Sanus Corp. Health Systems, and its Group life and health indemnity operations (which will be transferred to NYLHIC via a reinsurance agreement) into an integrated health care subsidiary, NYLCare Health Plans, Inc. (NYLCare), whereby NYLHIC will be a downstream subsidiary of NYLCare.  NYLAZ expects to offer a Corporate Owned Life Insurance/Variable Universal Life product for sale in 1996.<P>


<STRONG>Note B:</STRONG>  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the New York and Delaware State Insurance Departments ("statutory accounting practices").  Presently, these statutory accounting practices are considered generally accepted accounting principles for mutual life insurance companies and their wholly owned life insurance subsidiaries.  The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued an Interpretation, effective for 1996 financial statements, which establishes a different definition of generally accepted accounting principles.  If the Company chooses to adopt the accounting changes required under this new definition, the effect of the changes would be reported retroactively through restatement of all previously issued financial statements presented for comparative purposes.  The cumulative effect of adopting these changes would be included in the earliest year restated.  Financial statements prepared in conformity with statutory accounting practices would continue to be required by insurance regulatory authorities.<P>

<P>Under statutory accounting practices:  (1) bonds and mortgage loans on real estate are stated principally at cost after amortization of premium and discount, preferred stocks are stated generally at cost, and common stocks are stated at market value; (2) the value of invested assets has been adjusted for impairments that are other than temporary; (3) an asset valuation reserve is reported as a liability; (4) an interest maintenance reserve is reported as a liability to capture interest-income over the estimated remaining lives of the investments sold; (5) premiums are taken into income over the premium-paying period of the policies; guaranteed investment contract funds are recorded as income when received; (6) matured guaranteed investment contracts are included in benefit payments; (7) commissions and other costs in connection with acquiring new business are charged to current operations as incurred; (8) pension costs are based on Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions"; (9) unfunded postretirement benefit costs other than pensions are based on National Association of Insurance Commissioners requirements, which include establishing a liability for retired and fully eligible active employees; (10) policy reserves are based on mortality tables and interest assumptions which are consistent with statutory requirements and are designed to be sufficient to provide for contractual benefits; (11) dividends to policyowners consist principally of dividends expected to be paid during the subsequent year; (12) provision is made for federal income taxes estimated to be payable; (13) certain assets designated as "non-admitted assets" are not included in the Statement of Financial Position; (14) in 1995, the Company changed its method of accounting for the equity base tax and as a result, federal income taxes were reduced by $46 million, $12 million and $58 million for NYLIC, NYLIAC and the Company, respectively.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Outsourcing Your Employee Benefits:  Pension and Health
Care</STRONG></FONT><P>


"I felt like a rat caught in a maze," Frank recalled with a chuckle.  He had retired last
year after three
decades of loyal service with the same company.  His benefit records haven't been right
since.  <P>

According to Frank's own notes, he was once transferred six times during a single phone call.
. . after
which he was disconnected.  He was told twice that there was no record of him on file; once
that he was
deceased; and more than a dozen times that never-received forms were about to be -- or
already had
been -- mailed to him.<P>

Sound familiar?  The pension, health and other benefit programs for some companies are often
like
Frank's maze.  Thanks to a do-it-yourself patchwork design, even routine administrative tasks
- such as
a marital name change or change of address - can involve days of telephone tag, followed by
months of
straightening out incorrect and incomplete records. <P>

That's just one reason thousands of companies have begun "outsourcing" their benefits
services to
specialists such as New York Life Benefit Services Company.  Since 1970, New York Life Benefit
Services
Company has been providing consulting, actuarial, administrative and communication services
in the
field of employee benefits, retirement plans and related areas.<P>

Outsourcing, as the name implies, moves all or many aspects of your
company's benefit supervision to a benefit services company that focuses on providing just
those
services.  They do what they do best, and allow you to do the same.  <P>

Outsourcing businesses have found that plan participants can update records for such "life
events" as
marriage, divorce, sick leave, return to work, birth or death in the family and retirement,
in a few minutes.
. . often with just one toll-free telephone call.  <P>

They also receive convenient, one-stop service for their total benefit packages.  Just as
important, they
have found that they can now dedicate all their resources to their own core business
activities, and not
have to focus on benefit services.<P>

What types of services can you obtain from an outsourcing firm such as New York Life Benefit
Services
Company?  <P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
		<LI><STRONG>Underwriting analysis and plan design. </STRONG> A full-service approach
to outsourcing

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Permanent Life Insurance</STRONG></FONT><BR>
<STRONG>Good Property to Own</STRONG><P>




When building for your family's financial future, a permanent life insurance
policy
can
provide a solid
foundation. Living the "American Dream" has been a goal for generations. The
loving
family,
the
beautiful home ... this is the stuff dreams are made of. But protecting your
dreams
and
caring for loved
ones goes back a lot further than the "American Dream" - those intentions
are
probably as
old
as
mankind itself. Providing for your family's financial well-being means
putting
together a
comprehensive
program that will take care of today's needs, as well as plan for tomorrow.
This
customized
plan might
include a mix of bank accounts, health insurance, life insurance, annuities,
mutual
funds,
and an IRA.
When considering the need for life insurance, it's wise to take a close look
at the
advantages of
permanent life insurance. This type of policy not only offers financial
protection
to
survivors but can also
benefit a family during the insured's lifetime.
<P>
<STRONG>Why Permanent Life Insurance is Unique</STRONG><BR>
Whole life is the traditional form of permanent life insurance. It is just
that -
permanent -
you're
insured for your entire life, provided, of course, that you continue to pay
premiums. Your
coverage can
never be canceled, and the premiums are fixed - they can never be increased.
It is
also a
feature-rich,
customizable plan that can be tailored to suit you and your family's needs.
<P>
<STRONG>How Permanent Life Insurance Helps Beneficiaries</STRONG><BR>
To many, the primary reason for having life insurance is to protect their
family's
financial
future. Should
the insured die, life insurance helps pay off mortgages, fund college
educations,
take care
of final
expenses, offset the loss of the insured's income and allows a family to
continue
its
standard of living.
In most cases, insurance proceeds pass to beneficiaries free of probate
costs,
legal fees,
local
inheritance tax, and federal income tax. To the extent permitted by state
law,
insurance
benefits are
protected from claims of the insured's creditors. Benefits are generally
paid
promptly to
beneficiaries
through a convenient, interest earning, no-fee checking account. Or if you
prefer,
you can
designate a
payment method in advance, choosing from a variety of settlement options
that offer
periodic
payments
until the proceeds are paid in full. Not only does permanent life insurance
offer a
guaranteed payment
to beneficiaries at the death of the insured, but it also provides important
benefits during
your lifetime.
<P>
<STRONG>Benefits of Permanent Life Insurance During Your
Lifetime</STRONG><BR>
Unlike term life insurance, permanent life insurance is a value builder.
Both
guaranteed
values and
non-guaranteed values build up, tax deferred, over the years, and you can
put them
to work
for you in a
number of ways.
<P>
<STRONG>Accumulation of cash values</STRONG> - A permanent life insurance
policy
builds
guaranteed cash value as you
pay your premiums when due. These values are further enhanced since taxes on
the
money's
growth
are deferred. This cash value can be accessed through a valuable loan
provision.
<P>
<STRONG>Tapping into your cash values</STRONG> - You can borrow from your
policy's
accumulated
cash value by taking a
loan at competitive interest rates. You can use these funds any way you wish
- make
a down
payment
on a home, finance a new car, or even start a business (the J.C. Penney and
Disney
empires
were
started with loans from life insurance policies). The loan privilege is a
valuable
feature of
permanent life
insurance, but keep in mind that borrowing against your policy's value
reduces your
insurance
protection. In addition, any time you take money out of an insurance policy,
you
may be
subject to state
and federal taxes. It may be advisable to borrow only with the intention of
repaying your
loan in full.
Insurance companies offer several convenient repayment methods to restore
your
policy's
full
value.
<P>
<STRONG>Eligible for dividends</STRONG> - As "participating" insurance, a
permanent
policy is
eligible for dividends if and
when the company declares them. Each year, insurers determine how much
income
needs
to be
retained to build surplus. The remaining balance, if any, is returned to
policyowners in the
form of
dividends. As they are considered returned premiums, dividends are not
taxable.
You
can
use
your
dividends in a number of ways. Options include: leaving them on deposit with
the 
insurance
company
to earn interest; using them to purchase additional insurance coverage;
applying
them to
pay
all or part
of your premium; or taking them as cash. Unlike cash value, dividends are
not
guaranteed.
<P>
<STRONG>The Flexibility of Permanent Life Insurance</STRONG><BR>
As needs change, a permanent policy can be modified to reflect those
changes.
Most
insurance
companies make a wide range of optional benefits and riders available that
you may
add to
your policy
to enhance your existing coverage, extend coverage to family members, and
help
out
in
difficult times.
Additional underwriting may be required to add benefits or riders.
<P>
<STRONG>Enhancing your coverage</STRONG> - Along with the additional
coverage
available
through
dividend options, you
can increase your protection by adding a low-cost term insurance rider to
your
policy. An
accidental
death benefit provision can also be added, which doubles the insurance
proceeds if
the
insured dies
as a result of an accident. With an OPP (Option to Purchase Paid-up
additions)
rider, you
may
add,
within limits, extra money to your policy to provide additional death
benefits and
increase
cash value on
a tax-deferred basis.
<P>
<STRONG>Extending coverage to family members</STRONG> - You may add a
spouse
and children's
insurance rider to
protect those loved ones with term insurance. With a children's insurance
rider,
they will be
covered
with term insurance, and be guaranteed the right to purchase permanent life
insurance, in
specified
amounts at specified times, as they grow up.
<P>

<STRONG>Help in difficult times</STRONG> - With a waiver of premium rider,
premiums
are paid
by
the company during a
period of disability, as defined in the rider. Cash value, dividends, and
death
benefit grow
as if you were
still paying premiums. An automatic premium loan feature prevents your
policy from
lapsing
should you
miss a premium payment. If cash value is sufficient, it uses those values to
pay
the premium.
New York
Life now offers a living benefits rider, which pays a benefit should the
insured
become
terminally ill.
New York Life also pioneered the unemployment rider<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A
HREF="#1">1</A></FONT></SUP>. This provision waives one annual premium
should the policyowner become unemployed for a predetermined period of time.
<P>

<STRONG>Build Your House on a Sound Foundation</STRONG><BR>
When evaluating your family's financial needs, it's important not to
overlook life
insurance.
A permanent
life insurance policy is a unique, highly flexible financial product that
can
provide peace
of mind, as well
as help you meet important needs during your lifetime. It can be the sound
foundation upon
which you
build your financial house. In fact, it may actually help you purchase a
real
house! A life
insurance policy
can be used as collateral for a loan or mortgage. It can also help establish
a good
credit
rating. In
addition, accumulated cash values can be borrowed to make a down payment on
that
dream
home.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Retiring Parents: Are they
prepared?</STRONG></FONT><P>

Many people face their parents' retirement and aging without a second thought,
assuming that
Mom
and Dad are in good financial shape and ready for the golden years.  Making this
assumption
can be a
serious mistake.  You and your folks may think they are adequately prepared for
retirement,
but how far
down the road have they looked?  
<P>
With average life expectancy increasing, it's not uncommon for people to live 10 to
20 years,
or longer,
after retiring.  A great deal can happen in that time, and life's events don't
always work
out as planned. 
Culprits such as inflation and illness can wipe out a nest egg and undermine the
financial
independence of even the best-prepared retiree.  
<P>
<STRONG>Inflation and Illness Can Turn a Nest Egg into a Goose Egg</STRONG><BR>
Inflation can seriously erode money's purchasing power over time.  Even with a low
inflation
rate of 4%,
retirees at age 60 with an income of $2,500/month will have the purchasing power of
$1,388/month by
the time they're 75 years old.  In other words, the standard of living will be
virtually
halved in just 15
years.  Many retirees today find themselves searching for part-time jobs, in order
to keep up
with the
rising cost of living.  But no one can work forever.  And, in mere months, major
illness can
wipe out a
nest egg that took years to build.
<P>
According to the Abstract of the United States, 45% of an individual's lifetime
medical
expenses are
incurred during a final illness.  That's only half the story.  Research figures
published by
the New
England Journal Of Medicine indicate that 43% of those who turned age 65 in 1990
will enter a
nursing
home at some time during their lifetime.  As people get older, the probability
increases. 
With nursing
home costs averaging more than $30,000 a year, it's not uncommon for retirees to be
reduced
to
poverty.  
<P>
When retirees' savings are depleted, it adversely affects the next generation, too
- usually
at the worst
possible time. Frequently, adult children of senior citizens are working to provide
for their
own
households and futures.  Too often, they become saddled with the cost of supporting
their
parents
while still trying to meet their own household expenses.  It's a tough balancing
act.
<P>
<STRONG>Plan in Advance</STRONG><BR>
As an adult son or daughter, you must get involved with your parents' financial
affairs, and
the sooner
the better.  Start with a meeting of the generations to discuss everyone's plans,
wishes, and
concerns. 
Here are some topics to tackle, and questions to ask:
<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Will your parents' retirement funds be adequate?  Inflation and longer life
expectancies may
make retirement costlier than they've anticipated.  What supplemental funds are
available?

	<LI>Who will manage your parents' finances if they cannot?  Discuss long-term
financial
plans, the
location of records, and the possibility of establishing a contingent power of
attorney to
step in and help
during an emergency.

	<LI>What are your parents' estate plans?  When and how will they distribute
their property,
especially
if they become incapacitated?  Are there any charitable endeavors or causes they
wish to
contribute to? 
Do they have updated wills and an executor who knows their wishes?

	<LI>Are your parents' risk management programs adequate? Without adequate
health coverage,
a
single illness could wipe out an otherwise ideal retirement plan.  (Some children
cost-share
their
parents' premiums for Medicare Supplemental or Long Term Care insurance.  They see
it as a
wise
investment in their parents' future.)  What about life insurance?

	<LI>Do your parents have special medical requests, such as living wills,
trusts, lifetime
gifts, etc.? 
Where would they want to live, if incapacitated? (You may wish to discuss nursing
home and home
health care
options.)
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Problem</STRONG><BR>
Generally, parents and children feel uncomfortable discussing these matters.  It's
important
to do this
in a way that puts both generations at ease.  One solution is to bring in the
services of a
professional -
such as an insurance agent - who knows about retirement and estate conservation
issues and
who
can serve as an objective and knowledgeable source of information for that
discussion.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Risk vs Return</STRONG></FONT><BR><BR>
<STRONG>You Can't Have One Without The Other</STRONG>
<P>




Risk - Just the thought of it can give investors sleepless nights. However, through 
careful planning for your financial future, you can help manage risk.<P>
Risk is something you encounter everyday. Even crossing a busy street involves some
risk.
With
investments, balancing risk and return can be a tricky operation. All investors
want to
maximize their
return, while minimizing risk. Let's face it, putting your hard earned dollars on
the line
can be downright
frightening.<P>
Some investments are certainly more "risky" than others, but no investment is risk
free.
Trying to avoid
risk by not investing at all can be the riskiest move of all. That would be like
standing at
the curb, never
setting foot into the street. You'll never be able to get to your destination if
you don't
accept some risk. In
investing, just like crossing that street, you carefully consider the situation,
accept a
comfortable level of
risk, and proceed to where you're going. Risk can never be eliminated, but it can
be managed.
Let's
take a look at the different types of risk, how different asset categories perform,
and the
ways and
means to help manage risk.
<P>
<STRONG>Types of Risk</STRONG><BR>
When most people think of "risk" they translate it as loss of principal. However,
there are
many kinds of
risk. Let's take a look at some of them:<P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Capital Risk</STRONG> - Losing your invested monies.
<LI><STRONG>Inflationary Risk</STRONG> - Investment's rate of return doesn't keep
pace with
inflation rate.
<LI><STRONG>Interest Rate Risk</STRONG> - A drop in an investment's interest rate. 
<LI><STRONG>Market Risk</STRONG> - Selling an investment at an unfavorable price.
<LI><STRONG>Liquidity Risk </STRONG>- Limitations on the availability of funds for
a specific
period
of 	time.
<LI><STRONG>Legislative Risk</STRONG> - Changes in tax laws may make certain
investments less 
advantageous.
<LI><STRONG>Default Risk </STRONG>- The failure of the institution where an
investment is
made.
</UL>
<P>

<STRONG>How Do Different Assets Perform?</STRONG><BR>
It may seem that there are countless types of investment products to choose from
but,
basically, there
are three types of core investments: cash (or cash equivalents), bonds, and stocks.

<P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Cash</STRONG> - Investments such as bank savings and checking accounts,
Certificates
of Deposit (CDs), and
Treasury Bills. The prices generally don't fluctuate very much. To investors
concerned with
loss of
capital risk, cash would appear to be the most secure choice, as principal is
guaranteed
and/or
insured. Savings and checking accounts are highly liquid, as they can be readily
converted
into cash.
With CDs, you may face liquidity risk, as they must be held for a predetermined
period of
time or may be
subject to penalties for premature withdrawal. Although risk to principal may be
minimal,
loss of
purchasing power, or inflationary risk, must be taken into consideration. When
inflation and
taxation are
taken into account, returns can be considerably lower. Hypothetically, let's say in
1981 you
earned 14%
in an investment. It sounds astronomical; however, the inflation rate at one point
that year
soared to
15%. That's a net loss of value of at least 1% - and that's before taxes take
another bite.
<P>
<center>
<img src="/nyl/images/pfpitprr.gif"> <br>
</center>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="-1">The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures a representative sample of
goods and
services purchased
by American consumers. It is generally considered a primary measure of inflation.
T-Bills are
represented by the Salomon 1-3 year Treasury Index. It is an unmanaged index
generally
considered
representative of the U.S. short-term bond market. Bonds are represented by the
Salomon High
Grade
Long-Term Corporate Bond Index. It is a bond market indicator comprised of about
800 bonds
with
maturities of 12 years or more rated AA or AAA. Stocks are represented by S&amp;P 500
Stock
Index, a
registered trademark of Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. The Salomon and S&amp;P Indexes are
unmanaged and
do not include any charges or expenses that you may incur as a direct investor of
these
securities. Past
performance is no indication of future results.
</FONT><P>
<LI><STRONG>Bonds</STRONG> - Commonly called "fixed income investments," they are
basically loans
or "IOUs." Interest is
earned on the money you lend. The prices of bonds do move up and down, but normally
not as
much
as stocks. Many people think of bonds as conservative investments, but the returns
can have a
high
degree of volatility. The fluctuation of interest rates is called interest rate
risk, and a
downturn in the
bond prices could significantly decrease the overall return of any particular bond. 
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Stocks</STRONG> - Represent equity in, or partial ownership of, a
company.
An easy
way
to remember the
difference between stocks and bonds is: "With stocks, you own. With bonds, you
loan." The
price of a
stock or share can move up or down, sometimes a lot. The returns of stocks from
year to year
can be
quite volatile, but, as the graph illustrates, the returns
from stocks
have
significantly outpaced inflation, and topped the returns from cash and bonds as
well, over
this twenty-year period.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Finding Your Comfort Zone</STRONG><BR>
It's possible to achieve higher returns through stocks rather than bonds, and
through bonds
rather than
through cash, but you can't expect to get higher returns without taking on some
degree of
unpredictability. If you seek higher returns, you have to be willing to live with
higher
risk. "How much risk
is right for me?" The answer will affect your investment decisions. Although past
performance
is not a
guarantee of what will happen in the future, historical results over a long period
of time
can help you
make your investment decisions.
<P>
<STRONG>The Ways to Manage Risk</STRONG><BR>
There are a number of strategies that can help limit risk while offering the
potential of
higher returns.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Diversification</STRONG> - Investing in a variety of investments, or
simply
following
the old
adage "Don't put all
your eggs in one basket." With a portfolio spread among several different
investments, you
benefit when
each type is doing well, and also limit exposure when one or more investment is
performing
poorly.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Asset Allocation</STRONG> - Building upon the diversification concept,
with
asset
allocation you create a
customized portfolio consisting of several asset categories (cash, stocks, bonds)
rather than
individual
securities. Changing economic conditions affect various types of assets
differently;
consequently, each
asset category's return may partially offset the others'.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Dollar Cost Averaging</STRONG> - Systematically investing a fixed
dollar
amount at
regular time intervals. When
this disciplined program is adhered to and market fluctuations are ignored, it
attempts to
"smooth out"
the ups and downs of the market over the long haul. Dollar cost averaging, however,
cannot
guarantee
a positive return in a declining market and you must consider your ability to
continue
investing on a
regular basis under all market conditions.

<STRONG>The Means to Manage Risk</STRONG><BR>
Most investors find it difficult to diversify effectively across the full spectrum
of cash
and individual stocks
and bonds. That is why so many investors have chosen variable products to apply the
strategies
previously mentioned. Mutual funds, variable annuities, and variable universal life
insurance
products  offer the potential for maximizing investment
performance,
investment flexibility, and convenience. They allow you to allocate investments

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Single Premium Immediate Annuity (SPIA)</STRONG></FONT><P>




<STRONG>Income You Can't Outlive</STRONG><BR>
People are living longer and longer these days, but they haven't always made sure that they
have the
financial resources for an extended lifetime.  New York Life's SPIA is a product that can
take away these worries.  Here's how it works: you give New York Life a one-time premium
payment,
and in return you'll receive a steady stream of income payments for the rest of your life, no
matter how
long you live - guaranteed. <P>
SPIA gives you more security than a typical savings account, which you continuously draw
upon, hoping
it will last your entire lifetime.  SPIA doesn't have an account value you can access, but the
income you
receive from New York Life's SPIA is guaranteed never to run out.  That's something a
savings account
can't offer you.  And SPIA also offers you alternatives that can provide a lifetime income for
both you and
your spouse or provide income to your loved ones if you die prematurely.<P>
Your SPIA income is a fixed amount of money based on your age, your gender, the amount
of your
premium payment, and the frequency with which you receive your income payments:
monthly, quarterly,
semi-annually, or annually.  We can send your payments directly to you or, if you'd like, we
can even
have them deposited directly into your bank account.<P>
Best of all, SPIA is guaranteed by New York Life Insurance Company. 
<P>
<STRONG>Safe From Market Fluctuations</STRONG><BR>
In addition to providing a guaranteed lifetime income, SPIA can also take away some of the
worry about
managing your money.  Unlike income from stocks and bonds, your SPIA payments won't be
affected
by market swings. <P>
No matter what happens in the financial markets, you'll keep receiving your money from New
York Life. 

<P>
<STRONG>Tax-Qualified Money, Too<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A
HREF="#1">1</A></FONT></SUP></STRONG><BR>
If you have money tucked away in tax-qualified plans, such as  an IRA or 401(k) plan, that
money will
become taxable once you receive it.  Not only could that extra money throw you into a
higher tax
bracket,
it could even subject up to 85% of your Social Security benefits to taxation.<P>
But by putting that money into New York Life's SPIA and spreading your receipt of it over
several years,
you may avoid having that extra income put you into a higher bracket.  You may even be
able to prevent
(or limit) the taxation of your Social Security benefits.<P>
Furthermore, if you place tax-qualified money in SPIA, you might not have to worry about
how to satisfy
the Internal Revenue Services' Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) requirements -
because your
SPIA could automatically satisfy them.  This is important, because the IRS imposes severe
penalties if
these requirements aren't met.<P>


<P>
<STRONG>Maximize Your Income</STRONG><BR>
You can receive the highest income for your premium amount, gender, and age if you select
our "life
only" SPIA.  It guarantees that New York Life will pay you regularly for the rest of your life. 
Upon your
death, payments will cease.
<P>
<STRONG>Protect Your Spouse</STRONG><BR>
Sometimes, income for one life isn't enough.  Many couples want to make sure that they
have enough
income to last for both of their lifetimes.  If you select a Joint &amp; Survivor SPIA, you will receive
payments
for as long as either one of you is alive.  This way, both you and your spouse will be
protected against
outliving the savings you've amassed together.
<P>
<STRONG>Provide For Your Beneficiaries</STRONG><BR>
None of us like to think that if we were to die shortly after giving a lot of money to an
insurance company,
that money would be completely lost.  New York Life offers alternatives to prevent this:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Guaranteed Period Certain SPIA: With this SPIA, you choose a minimum period of time
during
which you will receive payments: either 5, 10, 15, or 20 years from the date that you
purchased your
SPIA policy.  If you die before this guaranteed number of years has passed, New York Life
will continue
sending your payments to your chosen beneficiary(ies) for the duration of the guarantee
period.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="#2">2</A></FONT></SUP>
<LI>Guaranteed Total Amount SPIA: With this SPIA, New York Life guarantees to pay you at
least the
amount of your original SPIA premium payment.  If you die before the total money you've
received
equals the amount of your original premium payment, New York Life will continue to pay
your chosen
beneficiary(ies) until the total amount paid to you and your beneficiaries matches your initial
premium. 
This way, you and your beneficiaries will at least "get back what you paid in."
</UL>
<P>

Of course, no matter which type of SPIA you choose, New York Life will keep paying you as
long as you
live.  But these additional alternatives enable you to make sure that your money will go
toward providing
for your needs or those of your loved ones.  <P>
These alternative SPIAs can also help ease the burden on your beneficiaries if you die
before all of the
guaranteed payments have been made.  That's because New York Life's payments go
directly to your
beneficiaries, unlike many other assets that may get tied up in probate. Your SPIA payments
could be
helpful to your beneficiaries at a very difficult time.<P>
<P>

<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><A NAME="1">1</A></SUP>Please discuss all matters relating to
taxation
with your own
professional tax advisor.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><A NAME="2">2</A></SUP>	If you choose a Joint &amp; Survivor
SPIA, you may
elect a 10-year
or 20-year Period Certain or a Guaranteed Total Amount.  The 5-year and 15-year Period
Certain
options are not available with a Joint &amp; Survivor SPIA.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Single Premium Life Insurance:  One Payment, Many Benefits</STRONG></FONT><P>

Single Premium Life Insurance can provide the vital financial protection of life insurance and
be an
important source of capital, in a convenient "pay one time" package.
<P>
<STRONG>SPL - A Unique Concept</STRONG><BR>

The Single Premium Life (SPL) Insurance concept is simple and straightforward:  you pay a
single
lump sum ($5,000 or more) for a paid-up, cash value life insurance policy.  SPL can provide
the
financial security that people seek from life insurance, along with an attractive means of
accumulating
funds for retirement or other long-term financial needs.  SPL offers:
<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>A death benefit free from federal income tax (in some states it may also be free
from 	state
death tax, probate expense, and the claims of creditors).
	<LI>A competitive interest rate credited to the policy's cash value.
	<LI>Tax-deferred accumulation of the policy's cash value.
	<LI>The ability to access cash values through policy loans.
	<LI>The convenience of paying just one premium for a paid-up policy.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>"A Souped-Up Annuity"?</STRONG><BR>
No, SPL is not an annuity, even though many industry experts feel that it may be more
appropriate to
compare SPL to annuities than to traditional life insurance.  SPL and single premium
deferred
annuities (SPDA) have many similarities:  a single premium payment, tax-free accumulation
of cash
value, identical tax rules governing loans, and a guaranteed death benefit.  But there are
key
differences.  The death benefit of SPL is usually a good deal larger than that of a
comparable SPDA; in
fact, by tax law, the SPL death benefit must be considerably larger than its cash value.  Also,
in most
instances, the death benefit of the SPL is free from federal income tax, while the
beneficiaries of
annuities incur taxable income on the gain in the contract.
<P>

<STRONG>A Brief History of SPL</STRONG><BR>
In the mid-1980s, insurance companies introduced the innovative SPL policy designed to
maximize
three tax advantages of life insurance:  generally no federal income tax on the death benefit,
tax-deferred
accumulation of cash value, and tax-free borrowing from that cash value.  These
advantages, along with
competitive interest rates on the policy's cash value, made SPL a very popular product with
savvy
consumers.
<P>
In 1988, Congress enacted legislation that affected the tax treatment of some life insurance
policies,
including SPL.  It is now technically classified as a Modified Endowment Contract, which
eliminates the
tax-free loan feature.  Now, when you borrow from an SPL policy, it results in a taxable
distribution.  The
lesser of the loan or gain is reported as a taxable gain.  In addition, the IRS imposes a 10%
penalty tax
on the taxable gain distributed before the policy owner is age 59 1/2.
<P>

<STRONG>To Whom is SPL Best Suited?</STRONG><BR>
While SPL is available to most ages (0 to 85), it can be a key part of the portfolio of mature,
fairly affluent
pre-retirees.  It provides financial security and the potential for 
long-term capital growth.  Under its current tax treatment, SPL may not be the most
appropriate product
for people with a need for current income.  For those seeking tax-free policy loans as a top
priority in a
life insurance product, a traditional permanent policy may be a better choice.  With SPL, it is
best to
restrict borrowing until after age 59 1/2, at which point the penalty tax would not apply.
<P>

<STRONG>The Many Uses of SPL</STRONG><BR>
Providing a degree of financial security for yourself and your family remains a primary
advantage of an
SPL policy.  SPL allows for only a single premium payment and generates an increasing
death benefit. 
Beneficiaries of SPL
proceeds
receive their funds free of federal income tax.  Those funds can be used to pay off mortgages
and other
debts, fund children's or grandchildren's educations, take care of final expenses, offset the
loss of the
insured's income, and allow a family to continue its standard of living.  To the extent
permitted by law,
insurance proceeds are protected from the claims of the insured's creditors.  Below are
other benefits
and uses of an SPL policy:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>
<STRONG>A Source of Retirement Income</STRONG> - Tax-deferred cash value
accumulation can be
considerable over the long-term.  You can tap into that cash value through the valuable loan
provision to
help fund a comfortable retirement.  Since most policies will be classified as Modified
Endowment
Contracts, you would be taxed on these loans to the extent of gain in the policy, including
any unpaid
loan interest.  However, loans taken after age 59 1/2 would not be subject to the additional
10% penalty
of the taxable amount.  Outstanding loans are deducted from the death benefit. 
<P>
<STRONG>Gifts to Minors and Adults</STRONG> - A lasting legacy can be left to minor
children and
grandchildren through the gifting of SPL.  There is no gift tax due on SPL policies purchased
on a
child's
life up to $10,000 of single premium.  The children's parents should be made custodial
owners of the
policies.  Parents can also make gifts to adult children.  Using joint gifts or community
property gifts,
parents can purchase SPL policies on each adult child for up to $20,000 with no gift tax
consequences. 
Withdrawals may be subject to a tax penalty if made before age 59 1/2.
<P>
<STRONG>Charitable Giving Uses</STRONG> - Using an SPL policy, you can make a
larger donation
to your favorite charity.  Over the long-term, SPL can multiply your single premium several
times over to
provide a generous donation to a worthwhile cause.  Philanthropic bequests have become
one of the
most meaningful uses of life insurance.  
<P>
<STRONG>Lump-Sum Distribution Vehicle</STRONG> - If there's a substantial lump-sum
distribution
coming your way in the future, you might want to take a look at SPL.  It can be a good place
to put
insurance proceeds, funds from the sale of a residence, an after tax distribution from a
qualified plan,
annual bonuses, or inherited funds.

SPL is offered by New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation.  For more information on SPL and its suitability to your needs, contact your New York Life
agent.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Single Premium Retirement Annuity (SPRA-2)</FONT></STRONG><P>


Are you concerned about having enough money when you eventually retire? Or, if
you've
already saved
enough for your retirement, do you need a place to maintain that money until you're
ready to
use it? A
place where that money can grow, tax-deferred? Either way, your New York Life agent
may
have the
product for you: SPRA-2 (Single Premium Retirement Annuity), a competitive deferred
annuity designed
to satisfy your retirement needs.
<P>
<STRONG>A Secure Retirement</STRONG><BR>
How will you spend your retirement years -financially secure, or struggling to meet
basic
needs? Even
if you haven't reached retirement, the time to begin shaping your financial future
is now. A
deferred
annuity could provide you with the money you need, down the road.<P>
Or perhaps you're already retired. Are you tired of watching taxes eat away at the
interest
you earn on
your CDs? Are your earnings from CDs or other investments triggering taxes on your
Social
Security
benefits? A deferred annuity could provide the solution.<P>
If you're looking for a savings alternative that can take care of your financial
needs and
perhaps even
provide a legacy for your children or grandchildren, SPRA-2<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A
HREF="#1">1</A></FONT></SUP> may be the right choice for you.<P>
SPRA-2 allows your money to grow tax-deferred at competitive interest rates. And
SPRA-2's
liberal
withdrawal provisions offer you the flexibility to control your financial
situation. Later on, you
can even
use the money you've accumulated to generate a retirement income you can't
outlive.<P>


<STRONG>The Power of Tax Deferral</STRONG><BR>
With SPRA-2, your money grows tax deferred -which means you won't pay taxes on your
money while
it's growing, only as you withdraw it.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A
HREF="#2">2</A></FONT></SUP>
Your money grows faster in SPRA-2 than it would in a
comparable, currently-taxable investment -because in SPRA-2, money that otherwise
would
be used
to pay taxes remains in the policy and earns interest, too.<P>
This graph illustrates how SPRA-2 can help your money grow faster. It charts the
growth of a
tax-deferred vehicle at 8%, compared to a similar, currently-taxable
vehicle.<SUP><FONT
SIZE="-1"><A
HREF="#3">3</A></FONT></SUP>
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="/nyl/images/psinanra.gif" ALT="Graph" ALIGN=CENTER BORDER="0">
</CENTER>
<P>
<P>
With SPRA-2, you can get more mileage out of money that's currently sitting in a CD
or other
currently-taxable investment. You can also use it to consolidate several smaller
IRAs. And if
you're
retiring, changing jobs, or if your company's pension plan is terminating, you can
take
advantage of
SPRA-2 and continue growing your pension money in an IRA rollover.
<P>
<STRONG>Competitive Rates, Plus First Year Enhancement</STRONG><BR>

SPRA-2 offers a competitive base interest rate and it also has a 1% interest
enhancement on that rate for the first policy
year.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="#4">4</A></FONT></SUP> Each year thereafter,
on your
policy anniversary, you'll receive NYLIAC's competitive base interest
rate. Historically, NYLIAC's base interest rate has been consistently higher than
the average
one-year
CD rate<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="#5">5</A></FONT></SUP> and is guaranteed
never to be
less than 3%. And with SPRA-2, higher amounts earn even
higher interest rates.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="#6">6</A></FONT></SUP> Also,
unlike many
financial alternatives, SPRA-2 doesn't have up-front sales
charges or annual maintenance fees that can hinder your money's growth.
<P>
<STRONG>Access To Your Money</STRONG><BR>
SPRA-2 is a product for building money over the long term, and withdrawals during
the first
eight policy
years may be subject to a surrender charge as follows:<P>

<P>

However, emergencies do arise, so SPRA-2 has a 10% "window" that allows you to take
up
to 10% of
your money, each year, without any surrender charges. And after eight years, you
can take
out as much
money as you want, at any time, without any surrender charges.<SUP><FONT
SIZE="-1"><A
HREF="#8">8</A></FONT></SUP> Compare this with a typical CD, where twenty years
from
now you'll
still face a penalty when you withdraw your money (except on the maturity
date).<SUP><FONT
SIZE="-1"><A HREF="#9">9</A></FONT></SUP>
<P>
With SPRA-2, you can request withdrawals as often as you'd like. If you want steady
payments, we can
send your interest, your 10% window, or any other amount on a regular basis -
monthly,
quarterly,
semi-annually, or annually.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A
HREF="#10">10</A></FONT></SUP> We can
even have it deposited directly into your bank account.
<P>
<STRONG>Flexibility and Control</STRONG><BR>
Unlike many financial products, SPRA-2 offers you flexibility and control over when
you
receive income
-
and when you pay taxes on it. You can wait until you're retired and in a lower tax
bracket
before you
begin to withdraw money. You can also spread your withdrawals over several years,
to even
out your
tax
burden and avoid throwing yourself into a higher tax bracket or increasing the
taxation of
your Social
Security benefits. With SPRA-2, you're in control. Of course, you should consult
your
professional tax
advisor.
<P>
<STRONG>Guaranteed Death Benefit </STRONG><BR>
If you die prematurely, the total accumulation value of your policy is paid
directly to your
named
beneficiary(ies), avoiding the costs and delays of probate. These funds could
provide
much-needed
comfort to your beneficiaries during a stressful time, when other monies may be
unavailable
to
them.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="#11">11</A></FONT></SUP>
If your spouse is your primary beneficiary, he or she even has the option of
becoming the
new owner of
the annuity, and continuing to build your money, tax-deferred.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Six Myths That Can Rob You Of Your Retirement
Plans</STRONG></FONT><P>
 
Like many people, you may have thought about retirement planning without actually
doing as much as
you'd like to do - at least not yet.  Even if you have been financially preparing
and have amassed what
you think is an adequate retirement income, think again. Often, people will base
their retirement
estimates on several mistaken, but commonly-held, assumptions regarding retirement
and what
various
resources will provide.  In many cases, the reality of retirement turns out to be
quite different from what
these common "retirement myths" would lead one to believe.
<P>
<STRONG>1.	Myth: I'll have Social Security to support me.</STRONG>  <BR>
	Reality: Wrong.  Social Security was never designed to cover income needs, but
rather to
supplement your pension and personal savings.  Here's an idea of what you can
expect from Social
Security: if your annual earnings are $25,000, $40,000, $60,000, Social Security
can provide 50%,
27%, 23% of your annual income, respectively.<P>
At least, that's what you can expect if you retire now.  However, some experts have
estimated that by the
time today's working baby boomers are ready to retire next century, there may not
be enough people left
in the work force to fully fund Social Security benefits.  That's all the more
reason to look into building up
your retirement savings.
<P>
<STRONG>2.	Myth: My living costs will be lower when I retire, so I'll need less
money.</STRONG><BR>
	Reality: Many times, just the opposite is true.  The only costs that may end
are mortgage payments
and the college tuition you may now be paying.  Health care costs could rise,
especially if you no longer
have employer-sponsored medical/dental coverage.  Also, many retirees frequently
eat out, which could
increase food bills.  And you'll probably want to pursue your favorite hobbies,
recreational activities, and
"dream" vacations.
<P>
<STRONG>3.	Myth: I'll have my company pension to tide me over.</STRONG>  <BR>
	Reality: Don't count on a pension as your main source of income.  Most defined 
benefit plans are geared toward providing a replacement ratio of between 40% - 60%
of your final
average salary.  This amount generally will be paid only if the employee has 25 or
more years of service
with the employer.  Also, defined benefit pensions are often reduced for payments
to Social Security. 
Under typical circumstances, the actual replacement ratio can drop to between 20%
and 30% of the
final average salary for a rank-and-file employee.  <P>
Naturally, each situation is different for each person.  But many retirees have
made the mistake of
counting on their pension, only to have to find part-time jobs to pay the bills. 
With the right planning, this
won't happen to you.
<P>
<STRONG>4.	Myth: I'm too old to begin planning for retirement now.</STRONG><BR>
	Reality: Not true.  Maybe you can't make up for lost time and opportunity but
it's never too late to
start saving.  Someone who takes early retirement at age 55 may still be going
strong after 30 years. 
So, while you'll have to contribute more to your retirement savings account than if
you had started
earlier, you can still be ready for your retirement - if you start now, and do what
needs to be done.
<P>
<STRONG>5.	Myth: The equity in my home is my retirement fund.</STRONG><BR>
	Reality: While a house may be your largest investment, residential real estate
does not always
appreciate.  Even when home prices do rise, they usually increase along with all
other living expenses. 
Even if you sell and move to a smaller home, you may wind up with far less money,
after paying capital
gains taxes, than you expected.  And, when all your savings have been depleted, you
can't sell your
house, piece by piece, in order to eat.  That's why it's important to have liquid
assets that will be there
when you need them.
<P>
<STRONG>6.	Myth: My main goal should be to preserve my savings.</STRONG><BR>
	Reality: Inflation is a money-killer, and it will deplete your principal.  To
stay ahead of inflation, you
shouldn't seek to preserve money, but to build on it.  Did you know that a
retirement income of $20,000
in 1970 would have to increase to $67,000 in 1990 to have the same purchasing
power?  A solid
financial plan allows your assets to grow, so that you can keep up with the rising
cost of living.

<STRONG>Here Today...Gone Tomorrow?</STRONG>



<P>
If you are 43 years old today and expect to begin receiving Social Security benefits at
age 66,
your
"normal retirement age" under present law, you may be in for a surprise.  In the year
2016 the
Social
Security program will begin running cash deficits.  
<P>
At first, the problem will be manageable: benefit payments and administrative costs will
exceed
income
by only $13 billion.  Within five years, however, the shortfall will be $200 billion
annually. Ten
years later,
it will be nearly $1 trillion. By the early 2020's, if not earlier, Social Security
benefits will almost
certainly
have to be reduced, if the program is to have any hope of meeting its obligations.
<P>
Social Security's Board of Trustees, whose financial projections are the basis for this
analysis,
says
not to worry, the system won't go broke until 2036.  They estimate that the trust funds
will rise to a
healthy nest egg of $5.6 trillion in 2024, two and a half times the projected annual
payout at that
time. 
According to the trustees, benefits will then be assured for another 12 years, as the
assets in the
trust
fund are sold off. There is a major problem, however, with the trustees' projection of a
40-year
margin
of safety: there may be no money in those trust funds when it is time to draw them down.
The
money
may have already been spent on other government programs.
<P>
When Social Security's income exceeds its expenses, the surplus is retained by the
Treasury and
used
to meet the government's non-Social Security expenses. For example, the recent gradual
rise in
Social
Security payroll taxes, from 10.8 percent of wages and salaries in 1983 to 12.4 percent
today, has
led to
annual surpluses that went to finance B-2 bombers, farm subsidies, savings and loan
bailouts,
and
other general federal expenditures. In return for using these funds, the Treasury issues
special
bonds
to the trust funds.
<P>
When Social Security's expenses exceed its income, theoretically these bonds can be
redeemed
to
meet current obligations.  Beginning in 2016, the Treasury will need to begin redeeming
these
bonds.
They will have to find the cash somewhere else.  Unfortunately, the choices are limited,
and none
are
politically attractive.
<P>
The Treasury has three options:
<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> <STRONG>Sell bonds to the public.</STRONG> Whether the public has sufficient
appetite to buy additional bonds 
at an average rate of $500 billion per year, even in the inflated dollars of 2025-2035, 
remains to be seen.
	<LI> <STRONG>Raise taxes.</STRONG>  Policymakers can raise taxes to provide the
Treasury with the necessary 
money. More directly, they could raise Social Security taxes, reducing the need for bond 
redemptions.
	<LI> <STRONG>Print money.</STRONG> This would increase the inflation rate. Because
Social Security benefit 
increases are tied to changes in the Consumer Price Index, inflation would result in
even 
higher benefit costs and the need to redeem bonds more rapidly, not to mention other
deleterious
economic effects.
</UL>

<P>
Rather than trying, probably unsuccessfully, to redeem the trillions of dollars in bonds
accumulated
over several decades, policymakers would likely enact a package of revenue increases and
benefit
reductions that would bring Social Security's income and outgo into balance in 2016, or
shortly
after.
The following big ticket items are likely to be included in such a package:
<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> <STRONG>Increased Social Security taxes.</STRONG> Tax increases are easy to
explain, and most 
workers pay the additional amounts through withholding from wages and salaries.
	<LI> <STRONG>Increased taxation of benefits.</STRONG> Since 1984, beneficiaries with
moderately high 
incomes ($25,000 for individuals, $32,000 for married couples filing joint returns)
have 
paid federal income taxes on up to 50% of their Social Security benefits. The 50% figure 
can be raised easily. In fact, this has already been proposed so often that it is likely
to occur 
long before 2016.
	<LI> <STRONG>Reductions in COLAs.</STRONG> Social Security's cost-of-living
adjustments were delayed 6
months by legislation in 1983. They could be delayed again, reduced, or frozen 
temporarily.
	<LI> <STRONG>Increase the Normal Retirement Age (NRA).</STRONG> The 1983 legislation
raised the NRA 
gradually, from 65 for workers born before 1938, to 67 for those born after 1959. These 
changes are present law, not just proposals. Congress has already demonstrated that it
can 
raise the NRA, and there is no reason to believe that they will stop at age 67.
</UL>

<P>
It certainly appears that the Social Security program will not be as rich for tomorrow's
retirees as it
is for
today's. People who hoped to be enjoying their retirement after 2016 should start saving
more
now if
they want to maintain a comfortable standard of living after retiring. The necessary
amounts
cannot be
saved during the last few working years; they must be accumulated over a much longer
period of
time.
Even if the trustees are correct, Social Security will have serious problems beginning
in 2036 and
will
need to change. Today's workers need to know that now, while they still have time to
modify their
retirement planning.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>How Much Life Insurance Do You Need?</STRONG></FONT><P>
 
 
The main purpose of life insurance is to provide financial security for your
family.  It helps to ensure that
when you die your family will have the financial resources it needs to provide for
your spouse, children,
an elderly parent or some other dependent.  However, life insurance also may be
used to meet a variety
of long-term financial goals.  It can help provide educational funds for your
children or funds for your
own retirement.  The question that most families and individuals have, then, is
"How much life
insurance do I need?"  The answer depends largely on your family's individual
circumstances.<P>
There are no hard and fast rules for determining how much life insurance is enough,
because no two
individuals have exactly the same needs. You may be single, supporting no one but
yourself.  Or, you may
be supporting an elderly mother or father.  You may have several children, but also
two incomes and
considerable net worth.  <P>
Whatever your situation, if you are providing financial support for people who are
depending on you, you
need life insurance.  However, there are several things to consider when you buy
life insurance, since
the proceeds can be used with several goals in mind.  For example, proceeds can:<P>
<UL>
<P><LI>Provide ready cash for final expenses:  These could include funeral costs,
medical 	expenses,
probate fees, and estate taxes.
<P><LI>Pay off outstanding debts: not only hospital bills, for example, but a mortgage
or an 	auto loan.
<P><LI>Provide replacement income in amounts necessary to cover:
<UL>
<P><LI>A readjustment period of two or three years after your death.  If you are a 
two-income family, it takes
time to adjust to one paycheck instead of two.  If you 	are the sole wage earner,
with young children
at
home, your spouse's need for a 	readjustment period is obvious.
<P><LI>The period while children under age 18 still are at home and dependent.  	
(Social Security benefits that may be available supply only part of your family's 
income needs.)
<P><LI>The college years, when Social Security benefits for dependents come to an 	end
just as expenses
grow.
<P><LI>The years between the time the youngest child becomes independent and the
surviving
spouse reaches retirement age.
<P><LI>The period after the survivor retires and receives Social Security or a
pension.
	</UL>
	</UL>
	<P>
In general, determining how much life insurance you need means deducting the sum
total of the
income that would be lost upon the insured's death from the sum total of your
family's ongoing
financial need.  It also means calculating the impact of inflation (usually
assuming 5% per year) and
building in enough "extra" to counteract inflation's effects.  It may seem
complicated, but it is an exercise
that is well worth doing.  It is also one that you do not have to tackle alone.<P>
A life insurance agent can help determine how much
life insurance your
family will need over time, based on the extent of your financial responsibilities
and the kinds and
amounts of your other resources.<P>
It may be that the solution to your insurance needs entails using a combination
of several plans,
and the combination may need to be changed as your situation changes.  
Fortunately, life insurance is flexible - with several types of plans available -
and an agent can work with
you to determine what products will best fit your ongoing needs and future goals. <P>

	Life Insurance Issues
</FONT>
</STRONG>
<p>

Many people think that life insurance is only for those with families.  While it is true that life
insurance can help provide for the needs of dependents when you pass away, it is also
important for someone starting out.  Although you may not have children at this point in your
life, you still have obligations. Adequate life insurance can ensure that these obligations are met once you've passed on.
<P>
Your obligations may include a student loan or a car loan.  Credit cards, phone bills and
other regular payments may need to be settled.  If your parents are financially dependent on
you, life insurance can help meet their needs.  Even if your parents are not financially
dependent on you, life insurance can help pay for your funeral costs, relieving your parents
of this expense.<P>

As you can see, there are many reasons why someone starting out should consider buying
life insurance.  No one expects to die when they are young and healthy.   But isn't it nice to
know that if anything should ever happen to you, the people who care about you won't bear
an additional financial burden? Use the links from this page to help you select life insurance
that is right for you.

<STRONG>Take a Closer Look</STRONG><BR>
Achieving your personal and financial goals didn't happen overnight. It took hard
work and dedication.
Protecting those years of hard work is a right you have earned and deserve. Proper
estate planning can
help accomplish this goal.  <P>
A properly structured estate plan builds security for you and your family today and
assures that your
estate will be transferred according to your wishes after you are gone.
Unfortunately, many individuals
are unaware that over half the value of their estate could be lost to federal
estate taxes at death. In other
words, without proper planning, the IRS could be the single largest beneficiary of
your estate. 
<P>

<STRONG>What is Your Estate Worth? </STRONG><BR>
Do you need to worry about estate taxes? It depends upon your estate's value. The table
below lists some of the assets used to determine your estate tax exposure. If married, remember
 to include the assets that you and your spouse jointly own.<P>
Keep in mind that the estate tax bill is due within nine months after your death.
This time constraint
could force your heirs to sell valuable assets, often at a discount, to raise the
cash needed to pay estate
taxes. So in a short period of time, a large percentage of your estate could
disappear.

<STRONG>How Do You Pay Estate Taxes?</STRONG><BR>
Now that you know the importance of properly structuring an estate plan, let's take
a look at four funding
methods.<P>
<STRONG>Cash</STRONG> - With this method, your heirs may be forced to sell stocks,
bonds, and
other investments to pay
the estate tax bill. However, selling in a down market could result in substantial
economic loss. Estate
assets will be depleted and future investment opportunities foregone.<P>
<STRONG>Credit</STRONG> - In some instances, your beneficiaries will need to obtain
a bank loan to
pay estate taxes.
Unfortunately, this is only a short-term remedy. Eventually, your heirs must repay
the loan plus
interest.<P>
<STRONG>Sale of Illiquid Assets</STRONG> - In some instances, your heirs will need
to sell any
business interest, personal
residence, or other real estate possessions to raise the funds to pay the estate
tax bill. The sale of a
business could leave your heirs without a potential source of livelihood.<P>
<STRONG>Life Insurance</STRONG> - Purchasing life insurance can be a cost-effective
funding
vehicle for an estate plan.
Your heirs may use the life insurance proceeds to pay the estate tax bill, without
depleting the estate's
assets. Life insurance proceeds can also be received free from federal income tax
and estate tax if the
estate plan is properly structured.
<P>
<STRONG>Survivorship Whole Life:  A Solution To Your Estate Needs</STRONG><BR>
Survivorship Whole Life insurance from New York Life uses today's dollars to make
sure your estate has the liquidity needed to pay estate taxes tomorrow. 
Survivorship Whole Life insures <EM>two</EM> individuals in <EM>one</EM> insurance
plan and pays the death benefit after the death of the <EM>second</EM> insured.  As
a result, the cost is more affordable than purchasing two separate life insurance
policies.
<P>
<STRONG>A Valuable Addition To Your Portfolio</STRONG><BR>
Survivorship Whole Life offers much more than a funding vehicle for an estate plan. 
It can help meet your business continuation, wealth replacement, charitable giving,
estate creation and dependent care needs-- whichever is more important to you.  In
this respect, Survivorship Whole Life is not just for older, affluent couples with
estate tax problems.  Survivorship Whole Life can also be a valuable addition to
younger couples' or business owners' portfolios.
<P>
Will your child or grandchild be protected if you and your spouse should die
unexpectedly?  Would you like to leave an asset or a business to one child, but
wonder how to provide equally to other children?  Will your business survive
without you or your partner?  Survivorship Whole Life can solve these and other
financial concerns.
<P>
<STRONG>Why Choose New York Life?</STRONG><BR>
At New York Life, we realize that no two individuals are alike.  For this reason,
our Survivorship Whole Life offers the flexibility to choose a method of payment
that best fits your situation.
<P>
In our Level Premium plan, the base premium remains fixed throughout the insureds'
lifetimes.  If rising costs and increased premiums down the road are a concern,
this option provides you with the security that comes from knowing your base
premium will <EM>never</EM> increase.
<P>
The Modified Premium plan has a fixed premium for the first <EM>fifteen</EM> years
of your policy.  In year sixteen, the base premium doubles and remains fixed
throughout the life of your policy.  This plan effectively minimizes current
premiums and allows you to prepare properly for future premium payments-- an
attractive feature particularly for younger policyowners.
<P>
We also offer a number of affordable riders that allow you to further tailor the
Survivorship Whole Life policy to meet your specific needs and objectives.  For
extra protection, term insurance may be available to increase your coverage at a
competitve cost.  Or, if you or your spouse or business partner will need cash when
one of you dies, riders that pay a death benefit after the <EM>first</EM> death may
be available.  Your New York Life agent will help you design a plan that meets your
specific needs.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Taking Care of Business with Split-Dollar Life
Insurance</STRONG></FONT><P>

	Split dollar is not a special life insurance policy; rather, it is a special
way
to purchase
permanent
insurance.  It is used widely to solve business buyout and executive benefit
problems.  For
split dollar to
work, two parties are required who "split" premiums and benefits.  In the IRS
definition, split
dollar "is
an arrangement whereby the party with the need and the party with the ability to
pay
premiums join in
purchasing an insurance contract in which there is a substantial investment
element." (Rev.
Rule.
64-328)
<P>
<STRONG>How Split-Dollar Insurance Works</STRONG><BR>
	In one typical arrangement, a corporation will purchase an insurance policy on
the life
of an owner
or
key employee, and will pay 100 percent of the premiums.  The insured can own the
policy
and name a
personal beneficiary.  The cash value and a portion of the death benefit will be
owned as
"collateral" by
the corporation to the extent of the premiums paid.  The terms of the corporation's
interest
are spelled
out in a "collateral assignment form" and a separate legal agreement.  If the
insured dies
while the
collateral assignment is in effect, the corporation recovers premiums paid from the
death
benefit.  The
remainder goes to the insured's personal beneficiary.  If the insured lives for a
number of
years, the
insurance cash value may be sufficient to repay the corporation for its entire
outlay.  The
policy may then
be "rolled out" to the insured, who can continue the plan as a personal insurance
policy.<P>
	For tax treatment, the corporation cannot deduct its premiums, nor is the
employee
taxed on those
premiums.  Rather, the employee is taxed on what the IRS calls "the economic
benefit,"
which is the
cost of insurance benefit as defined by the IRS.<P>
	A "tax wise" variation of split dollar works as outlined above, with one
additional
wrinkle.  Here the
insured pays a portion of the premium out of his or her own pocket; the corporation
pays the
balance.  In
this variation, called "contributory split dollar," the insured is not taxed on
that part of the
economic
benefit paid with personal funds.  The employee's  share of the premium can equal
or
exceed the
economic benefit.
<P>
<STRONG>Uses of Split-Dollar Insurance</STRONG><BR>
	Business buyout: Al and Luiz are co-owners of Computer Works, Inc.  Both
see
the
virtue of a
buy-and-sell agreement and the logic of funding that permanent need with permanent
life
insurance. 
Neither Al nor Luiz, however, wants to pay permanent insurance premiums from his
own
pocket.  Here
is what they do.  Al and Luiz apply for insurance, each on the life of the other,
in an amount
sufficient to
fund the buy-and-sell agreement, and they name themselves beneficiary.  The bulk of
the
premiums are
paid by the corporation on a split dollar basis.  Al and Luiz contribute only an
amount equal
to the
economic benefit, roughly the same amount that they would have spent on a standard
term
policy. 
Eventually, Computer Works, Inc. will recover its premiums from either the cash
value or the
death
benefit in accordance with the split-dollar agreement and collateral assignment
form. Split
dollar
enables Al and Luiz to achieve an important business continuation objective in a
way that is
fair and
effective.  
<P>
	Executive Benefits:  Goodman, Inc. is wholly owned by an architect, Ellen
Goodman.  In
addition to
several other employees, Ellen employs a skilled thirty-five year old designer,
Karl Schmidt. 
Ellen
would like to retain Karl's services, but is not eager to install a benefits
program for all
employees. 
After considering a number of alternatives, Ellen, on the advice of her CPA,
chooses a
split-dollar plan
for Karl.  Split dollar provides Karl with a significant death benefit.  Equally
attractive are the
cash
values. 
Even after repaying Goodman, Inc. for its premium contribution, the policy may
build
significant
cash values by the time Karl is sixty-five.  The plan is just too good for
Karl to walk
away.  For
Goodman, Inc., split dollar is a cost-effective way to retain a valued employee.
	<P>
	Split dollar can also be an estate planning tool.  Properly structured, the
policy
proceeds from the
plan
can be kept out of the insured's estate.  Those contemplating a split-dollar plan
should
contact their
New York Life agent, as well as their own legal and financial advisors.<P>
	Split dollar is not something for nothing, but for the insured it can be a
great
deal for
very little.

<STRONG>What it Can Do for You</STRONG><BR>


Let's face it - you work hard for your money, and that's why you need your money to
work hard
for you. 
Of course, income tax is a fact of life - and it's not something you have a great
deal of
control over. 
However, there is a way to accumulate money without having to pay taxes on it - at
least not
until you
use it.  It's called tax deferral, and several types of insurance and financial
products
offer it.
<P>
<STRONG>What is Tax Deferral?</STRONG><BR>
With tax-deferred products, you don't pay taxes on accumulated funds, interest or
dividends
until you
actually withdraw the money. Since the gain in a tax-deferred product isn't taxed
until it's
withdrawn, it
usually accumulates at a faster rate.  For this reason, tax-deferred accumulation
can provide
a powerful
financial edge.
<P>
If you participate in a 401(k) plan offered by your employer or if you own an
Individual
Retirement
Account (IRA), you're already enjoying the benefits of tax-deferred accumulation. 
Many
insurance and
annuity products also offer this advantage.  Even the interest and dividends
generated by
these
products generally avoid current income taxes!
<P>
<STRONG>The Power of Tax Deferral</STRONG><BR>
The following chart shows the tremendous difference tax deferral can make in the
rate at
which your
money grows.  If we assume that a single sum of $50,000 will be invested for 30
years at a
hypothetical
interest rate of 8%, we see that the tax-deferred vehicle provides better long-term
accumulation.  If you
are in the 31% tax bracket, you may be able to accumulate about $250,620 in a
taxable
account. 
However, if you used a tax-deferred account for the same investment, you may
accumulate over
$503,100.  (Please note that a 10% IRS tax penalty may be imposed on withdrawals
from
annuities,
some insurance products, IRAs, or 401(k) plans, when these withdrawals are made
before the
purchaser has reached age 59 1/2.)

<STRONG>Let it Accumulate</STRONG><BR>
Tax-deferred products offer you control over your financial situation.  Not only
does your
money
accumulate but, if you are selective in your withdrawals and plan them accordingly,
you can
avoid
getting "hit" with too many tax consequences when you do withdraw the money. 
Here's why:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Tax deferral strategies work best for long-term planning, usually retirement
planning.
The idea is to
leave the money where it is for a long time - to let it go and let it grow. Sure
you'll be
taxed on the money
you start to withdraw after you've retired - but you may be in a lower tax bracket
by then,
which would
serve to soften the tax blow.

<LI>You can be selective in your withdrawals and plan them so that you do not
suffer
unnecessary tax
consequences. The tax system has "thresholds" (tax brackets) that will help you
determine how
much
of these funds you can withdraw during a given year. If you are prudent with your
withdrawals
- and you
don't break into a higher tax threshold - then the effect of these withdrawals on
your taxes
will be
minimal. Remember, you're only taxed on what you withdraw.
</OL>
<P>
<STRONG>Tax-Deferred Insurance Products</STRONG><BR>
The cash values in life insurance and annuities accumulate tax deferred.  An
annuity offers
you
protection so you don't outlive your savings.  It does this by generating a steady
stream of
income that
will be taxed as you receive it - a little at a time. As for whole life insurance,
the main
feature is the death
benefit protection it provides, but it also offers the additional benefit of cash
accumulation.  (Note:
Another major tax advantage of life insurance is that, in most instances, the
payout to your
beneficiaries
is income tax free!)  
<P>

For people who want to combine tax deferral with the potential growth from a
diversified portfolio, there are variable universal life insurance and variable
annuity
plans. Both of these
offer the opportunity to participate in investment accounts - and the associated
higher level
of risk.
However, like all tax-deferred products, they accumulate gradually over time. That
is why
insurance and
annuity products - like most tax-deferred vehicles -  may work best as long-term
funding
vehicles.
<P>
Only you can determine what your financial needs are - right now and later in 
your life. But it's important to remember that sooner or later, many of us can
benefit from tax-deferred products. Talk to your New York Life insurance agent or
your NYLIFE Securities registered representative, and examine your needs -- not
just your immediate goals but your long-term goals. You'll see whether tax-deferred
products could be right for you.<P>

<STRONG>Is Your Tax Bite Growing?</STRONG>
<BR>

While a discussion about taxes may not be a topic of your nightly dinner conversation, it is an issue that concerns us all, and with good reason. In 1996, we spent over one-third of our time working for the government.
<P>
<STRONG>Tax Freedom Day</STRONG><BR>
According to an annual report issued by the Tax Foundation, Americans worked the first 127 days of 1996, from January 1 to May 6, just to pay taxes. In theory, this means that on May 7 your job began to
produce spendable income and your taxable investments became profitable. This
represents the latest Tax Freedom Day ever.
<P>
The Tax Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research organization, took its
analysis one step further
and broke down the tax implications for each state. Connecticut was the unlucky
winner, bearing the nation's largest tax burden in 1996 with a Tax Freedom Day of May 31. Alabama sat
on the opposite end of this spectrum with a Tax Freedom Day of April 23.
<P>
<STRONG>The Eight Hour Work Day</STRONG><BR>
To put a different spin on the way Americans see their tax burden, the Tax
Foundation
examined the
portion of each eight hour working day necessary to pay federal, state, and local
taxes. In
1996, the
Foundation discovered that the average American spends 2 hours and 47 minutes each
working
day to
pay the necessary federal, state, and local taxes. This is more time than it takes
to pay for
food, shelter,
and clothing combined. Most of this time, 1 hour and 50 minutes, covers the federal
tax
portion. The
remainder, 57 minutes, covers state and local taxes. 
<P>
<STRONG>What Are Your Options?</STRONG><BR>
How can you reduce the time it takes to reach Tax Freedom Day next year? Ask
yourself three
simple
questions related to your financial situation in 1996:

<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Did I receive 1099s from my bank accounts?
	<LI>Did I receive 1099s from other investments?
	<LI>Did I spend or reinvest the interest? 
</UL>
<P>
If you earned taxable interest on investments that you expect to hold for the long
term, then
you had to
pay current taxes on it. With taxable investments, the reality is that you don't
always
liquidate your
holdings to pay taxes. In all likelihood, you pay the tax out of current income or
out of
withholding from
other income sources. This technique reduces your spendable income today, and may
reduce it
in the
future. Fortunately, there are sensible strategies that will help you maximize
long-term
returns while
potentially reducing your tax bill. 
<P>
With investments like annuities, your earnings have the ability to accumulate on a
tax-deferred basis.
Simply put, you don't have to pay current taxes on money that is ear-marked for the
long
term. Instead,
all earnings are reinvested and continue to accumulate on a tax-deferred basis
until
withdrawn. Of
course, withdrawals of earnings from annuities are taxable and, if you are under
age <NOBR>59
1/2</NOBR>, may be
subject to a 10% tax penalty.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Term vs. Permanent Life
Insurance</STRONG></FONT><BR>
<STRONG>A Fresh Look At An Age-old Question</STRONG>



<P>
The term versus cash value life insurance debate has gone on for years, as if it
were
possible to say
that one type of coverage is all good, the other all bad.  Sorry, it's just not
that
simple.<P>
Term life insurance has its place. If you're young or cash shy, term can be an
ideal stopgap
solution; it
can provide you and your family with maximum coverage for the lowest immediate
premium
outlay. If the
choice is an adequate amount of term coverage versus no protection at all, term
insurance may
well be
the best choice.<P>
It is also very often the product of choice when protection needs may be high for a
period of
time, then
drop back, such as when your family is growing. Term insurance can also be an
effective way
to
supplement permanent insurance during high-need years, such as when family and
other
financial
responsibilities are outpacing income.<P>
In these situations, term coverage allows you to obtain crucial death benefit
protection
without breaking
your budget. Also, if the coverage is convertible (the coverage can be "converted"
to a
comparable cash
value policy, without the need to provide evidence of insurability), you can get
the coverage
you need
today...with the ability to obtain permanent coverage in the future. In this
respect, term
insurance meets
a valuable need.
<P>
<STRONG>The True Cost of Term Life Insurance</STRONG><BR>
However, term insurance has its drawbacks. It certainly isn't right for all people
or under
all
circumstances. Among its weaknesses, be aware of the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>You do have to die to "win." As unpleasant as that sounds, it's true. Term life
insurance
provides a
death benefit only, and only for a specific period of time. When the term of
coverage
expires, so does
your protection. Also, if you stop paying premiums, the coverage ends. Period.
<P>
<LI>Let's say that you own $500,000 of term insurance. You've kept the coverage in
force for
ten years,
and
the policy expires at midnight on December 31. If you die at 11:59 on New Year's
Eve, your
family
receives the full $500,000 in death benefit proceeds. However, if you die at 12:01
on January
1, your
family receives nothing under the policy, since the contract has expired.
<P>
<LI>Purchasing term insurance has often been compared to renting a house. When you
rent, you
get
the
full and immediate use of the house and all that goes with it, but only for as long
as you
continue paying
rent. As soon as your lease expires, you must leave. Even if you rented the house
for 30
years, you have
no "equity" or value that belongs to you.
<P>
<LI>There is the very real danger of becoming uninsurable when the term coverage
expires.
While
many
term policies are convertible to permanent coverage, others may not be. Most of
all, even if
the coverage
is convertible, there are time limits. If the policy is allowed to expire, you may
be
required to reapply. If
you are found to be uninsurable at that time, you will be without coverage.
<P>
<LI>The long-term cost of term can become increasingly burdensome. Premiums
increase at each
renewal, with the price per thousand dollars of coverage becoming prohibitive for
many people
as they
get older. Many people buy term coverage when they're in their 20s because it seems
downright
cheap
compared to a cash value policy with the same death benefit amount. By the time
they're in
their 40s,
the coverage seems a bit pricey, as the rate goes up. In their 50s, the cost has
generally
well
outstripped the cost of permanent coverage. Finally, in their 60s, if not sooner,
they drop
the policy - not
because they no longer need the protection, but because they can't afford it.
Meanwhile, the
person who
may have paid more for that permanent policy in his or her 20s may still be paying
the same
premium.
<P>
</UL>
<STRONG>The Value of Permanent Life Insurance</STRONG><BR>
Cash value life insurance is still the best long-term solution for many people. The
reasons:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>It <EM>always</EM> pays. Cash value life insurance provides life-long insurance
protection. With few
exceptions,
once you have been approved for the coverage, your policy cannot be canceled by the
carrier,
provided
you pay all required premiums. Regardless of your health or other factors, the
insurance will
remain in
force.
<P>
<LI>Higher initial premiums can actually be less expensive than term in the long
run. In
fact, the policy
may
be able to "pay for itself." Most permanent policies are eligible for dividends,
which are
not guaranteed,
if and when they are declared by the insurance company. Many companies offer the
option to
apply
accumulated dividends towards payment of all or part of the premiums. If values are
sufficient,
out-of-pocket premium payments may end after several years, yet coverage can
continue for
life. So
long-term net cost can be quite low compared to the total cost for a term policy.
<P>
<LI>It can eliminate the problem of future insurability. Cash value life insurance
does not
expire after a
certain period of time. It does not need to be renewed. Also, some policies contain
guaranteed
purchase options, which allow you to buy additional coverage at specified times,
regardless
of your
health.
<P>
<LI>It builds cash value. These dollars - which, under many policies, are
guaranteed - can be
used in
the
future for any purpose you wish. If you like, you can borrow cash value for a down
payment on
a home,
to help pay for your children's education or to provide income for your retirement.
(Note:
Borrowing cash
value from your policy will affect your total policy values.) Plus, if you decide
to stop
paying premiums
and surrender your policy, the guaranteed policy values are yours.
</UL>
<P>

Recommendation: When purchasing coverage - or renewing a term policy - look at more
than just
the
premium. To help you select the best-choice coverage for you, contact your New York
Life
agent. Your
agent is a licensed professional who can discuss your goals, analyze your needs and
review
the pros
and cons of the various options available to you, all at no cost or obligation.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>The Advantages of a Bundled 401(k) Plan</STRONG></FONT><P>

Has your company's 401(k) pension plan become difficult to manage?  It started out as a nice
idea, but
it has since grown into an administrative nightmare.  If so, why not consider going from an
"unbundled"
to a "bundled" plan design?<P>

If yours is a classic "unbundled" plan, chances are you're quarterbacking a diverse team of
outside
vendors: obtaining investment services from one vendor, recordkeeping from another, and plan
communications from yet a third, while your plan trustee involves yet still another contact. 
Or perhaps
you keep some services in-house, while outsourcing others.<P>

One problem:  It can be confusing and inefficient.  Your plan may have little, if any,
systems integration. 
As a plan sponsor, you may have to make several contacts to conduct plan changes or obtain
information.  Plus, because noboby is responsible for the entire plan, there may be limited
accountability among vendors.  Not only are errors more likely, but the task of sorting them
out will likely
fall back on your shoulders.<P>

A second problem:  It can be unnecessarily expensive.  Because you have hired separate
"experts" for
each component of your plan, you should expect to pay more. Each "expert" comes with its own
profit
margin requirements, which you will have to pay for.  Additionally, since you have to manage
the
different players, your retirement plan can divert precious resources away from the business
of
running
the business. <P>

An attractive alternative:  "bundling" your pension plan.  Bundling enables you to
consolidate, or
bundle, as many aspects of your pension plan under one vendor as you deem necessary.<P>

As a result, you can offer your employees a quality 401(k) plan, for instance, that can
reduce your
recordkeeping costs by as much as 50%; provide enhanced benefit flexibility and service for
participants and let your human resource people focus on human resource issues - not pension
plan
management.<P>

to
bundled plans often enjoy...<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>The Cost Of Waiting</STRONG></FONT><P>



<STRONG>Procrastinating Can Be Expensive</STRONG><BR>

There are plenty of excuses for not setting financial
goals; "I don't understand
investing," "I don't have the time to plan," "I can't afford to invest." Well, the
truth of the matter is, you can't
afford to delay. Early planning can help to maximize the power of time, and can
help you reach your
financial goals.
<P>
<STRONG>Time is on Your Side</STRONG><BR>

The concept of the power of time is a simple one: The sooner you begin to save for
your future financial
needs, the greater the wealth you can accumulate. Although the idea is
straightforward and logical,
most people fail to recognize the enormous increase in value that can result from
beginning to save
early. The best way to demonstrate the power of time is by way of example. Let's
take a look at the
different approaches to investing taken by twin brothers, Ken and Ray.<br>

<P>
<STRONG>Starting Early</STRONG><BR>

Ken, looking to build a large nest egg for his retirement, chose to invest $1,000
per year in an Individual
Retirement Account (IRA), starting at age 30. He continued his payments for ten
years until age 40,
earning an average of 8% per year on his investments <SUP><FONT SIZE=-1><A
HREF="#1">1</A></FONT></SUP>. At age 40, he stopped
contributing to the IRA,
but left his $11,000 of contributions in the account, plus earnings, until
retirement at age 65. <P>

<SUP>1</SUP><A NAME="1"> 8% interest is for illustrative purposes only
and is not intended to predict nor guarantee the results of any security product.</A>


<P>
<STRONG>Starting Late</STRONG><BR>
Ray, the second twin, was a bright guy but a bit of a procrastinator. He too saw
the need to put money
away for his retirement but didn't begin his investment plan until age 41. At that
point he began investing
$1,000 a year into an IRA. He also averaged an 8% annual return,<SUP><FONT SIZE=-1><A
HREF="#1">1</A></FONT></SUP>  but he continued
to make $1,000
investments for 25 years until he retired at age 65. His contributions over the
years totaled $25,000.
<P>
<center>
<img src="/nyl/images/pfpitpcw.gif">
</center>
<P>
<STRONG>The Dramatic Difference</STRONG><BR>
Given the fact that Ken contributed $11,000 while Ray contributed $25,000, you
might expect that the
second twin would have a significantly greater total for retirement at age 65.
Surprisingly, just the
opposite is true!
<P>
Assuming the tax-deferred IRA of each twin earned 8% a year, at age 65 the account
balance for the
first twin would be $123,000, while the second twin would have $79,000. The
preceding hypothetical
chart vividly illustrates the dramatic difference in the accumulated wealth for the
two.
<P>
<STRONG>The Cost of Waiting</STRONG><BR>
Ray was on the right track. He invested steadily and wisely, earning good returns -
his only mistake
was getting a late start. Ray invested more than twice the amount his brother did,
yet had less money to
enjoy at retirement. By getting an earlier start, Ken benefited from more years of
compounding. Left to
accumulate in his account, the earnings from his early years earned additional
returns. In other words,
"earnings earn earnings."
<P>
<STRONG>The Impact of Time and Life Insurance </STRONG><BR>
Postponing the purchase of life insurance to a perceived "better time" can also
have a definite cost of
waiting. For example, let's take a look at Trish's quandary. She's identified the
need for $250,000 of
permanent life insurance coverage. Trish is considering buying a $250,000 whole
life policy, which
would provide immediate insurance protection, and offer guaranteed cash value
accumulation that
could, in the long term, be borrowed against to fund a child's college education or
help supplement
retirement income. At age 40, her annual premium would be $4,000, but she's debating
whether or not
to wait five years, at which point her premium would be $5,000. Looking at both
scenarios over the long
term, total premium paid would balance out by age 65 ($4,000 for 25 years, and
$5,000 for 20 years
both equal $100,000). 
<P>
<STRONG>How Waiting Can Affect Cash Value, Death Benefit, and
Insurability</STRONG><BR>
Waiting would have a negative effect on several key areas. A whole life policy
offers the benefit of
tax-deferred accumulation of cash value. Generally speaking, the sooner you start,
the faster your cash
value will grow over the long term. These cash values can be accessed through
policy loans to help
meet financial needs.<P>
In addition, a whole life policy is eligible to earn dividends, if and when they
are declared by the
company. Unlike cash values, dividends are not guaranteed. Trish could use her
dividends in a variety
of beneficial ways including using them to purchase additional insurance to enhance
her total death
benefit. Waiting means missing five years of potential dividends and the
opportunity to increase the
benefit paid to her beneficiaries.<P>
Waiting five years can also place Trish's insurability in jeopardy. She's insurable
at age 40, but may be
uninsurable due to a health condition at age 45. Perhaps the greatest risk in
waiting is if she were to
die in the next five years. In that case, the cost would be the $250,000 death
benefit her beneficiaries
would not be paid. <P>
Purchasing this policy now would cost no more than waiting five years. Cash value
and death benefit,
however, should be higher. Most importantly, insurance protection would begin now.
So why should
Trish wait?
<P>
<STRONG>It's Never Too Early to Start</STRONG><BR>
Although expenses like the kids' college tuition and your own retirement may seem
like distant images,
it pays to face up to the future today. With college tuition rising at a rate of 6%
to 8% a year (the College
Board, September 1993), you'll need all the time you can muster to meet those
spiraling costs. Looking
farther down the road, a company pension and Social Security payments may not
afford the lifestyle you
desire in retirement. Your financial future is your responsibility, and with early,
careful planning, you can
make for a brighter one. As Ray discovered, waiting just a few years can mean
thousands of dollars
less waiting for you. Time can be an important investment ally. You should consider
planning and
investing, and put the power of time on your side. For ideas on putting your goals
into action, contact
your New York Life agent or NYLIFE Securities registered representative.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>The Importance of a Will</STRONG></FONT><P>


Despite the importance of the will in an estate plan, it is estimated that seven out of ten
Americans die without a valid will<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="#1">1</A></FONT></SUP>.<P>
If a will is such an important document, why don't more people have one? Unfortunately,
creating a will forces you to come face to face with your own mortality - and dealing with
death is difficult. But, it may be much more difficult for your loved ones after you are gone
if you don't prepare a will.<P>

<STRONG>A Financial Blueprint of Your Assets</STRONG><BR>
A will is an instrument, an extremely powerful instrument, you can use to distribute your
probate assets to your loved ones after you are gone. (Probate assets generally refer to
those assets in your name only that do not pass to another at your death by operation of
law.) Think of your will as the financial blueprint of your probate assets. Your will clearly
states who will inherit your probate assets, when they will inherit your probate assets, and
any conditions that must be met for them to receive your probate assets.<P>
At death, the court rules on the validity of your will. If the will is valid, the court
instructs your executor to carry out the terms of the will according to your wishes. (This
act is known as a decree of probate.) The executor is the person appointed by you in the will
to supervise the distribution of your probate assets.<P>

<STRONG>What Are the Consequences of Not Having a Will?</STRONG><BR>
According to Gerald Condon and Jeffrey Condon, authors of Beyond the Grave, without a will,
you increase the likelihood of conflicts, bitterness, and after-death disputes between your
children and other family members. Here's how: If you die without a valid will, the court
does not have your financial blueprint to follow. Therefore, it has no way of knowing how to
distribute your assets. <P>
By "dying intestate," you lose the ability to direct the distribution of your estate. The
state where you lived steps in at your death and makes the decisions for you, according to
the distribution schedule set forth in its intestacy statutes. The state's decisions are designed 
to pass property to those who would most benefit. Unfortunately, the
state's decisions may not conform to your wishes or to what is best for the people closest to
you. Intestacy usually means outright payments. This can cause a multitude of problems and
misunderstandings, not to mention tying up your assets in the probate process for months or
years. <P>

<STRONG>Common Misconceptions</STRONG><BR>
Here are some of the more common rationalizations for not creating a will, and the facts that
quickly dispel those "myths."<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<STRONG>Myth:</STRONG> "My assets are so small that a will is not necessary."<BR>
<STRONG>Fact:</STRONG> Think again. Few people are worth so little that a will is not
necessary. Add together
the value of your home, car, furniture, jewelry, savings account, and investment portfolio. 
Subtract from this total your personal debts. The bottom line is that you are generally worth
more than you think. Even if some items do not hold great monetary value, they could hold an
enormous amount of sentimental value. Failing to indicate who receives these treasures in
your will can cause friction between family members that lasts for decades.<P>

<STRONG>Myth:</STRONG> "When I die, my spouse will get all of my assets."<BR>
<STRONG>Fact:</STRONG> If you and your spouse own assets jointly, at death your share of the
assets will
automatically go to the surviving spouse. But, what happens when your surviving spouse dies?
What will your children receive? Does your spouse have the financial know-how to manage the
family wealth? If your spouse remarries, some or all of your spouse's assets may wind up in
the hands of his/her new spouse.<P>    

<STRONG>Myth:</STRONG> "I can create a will on my own and save the legal costs."<BR>
<STRONG>Fact:</STRONG> "Do-it-yourself" wills often do not contain all of the necessary
components as required by law and are frequently ruled invalid by the courts. A
vaguely-worded clause can result in lengthy legal battles. Anyone who might benefit from the
invalidation of your will can contest it, and if the courts decide in his or her favor your
estate may be required to cover all legal costs. Remember, the few dollars you save now can
cost your loved ones thousands of dollars later. <P>

<STRONG>Myth:</STRONG> "I don't want my final wishes to be set in stone. I'll create a will
later in my life."<BR>
<STRONG>Fact:</STRONG> A will is an extremely flexible document whose terms can be changed as
often as needed. In fact, any legal expert will tell you that a will should be re-examined
periodically to make sure it is up to date. A will should receive a checkup whenever there is
a substantial change in your life. Remember, the terms of a will only become effective at
death. <P> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<STRONG>How Do You Create A Will?</STRONG><BR>
Drafting a will is a highly technical task. That's why it is an endeavor you do not want to
tackle single-handedly. It's important that you call on the services of an inheritance
planning lawyer. Having a lawyer assist you in drawing up a will has several advantages. A
lawyer can help you: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Avoid the problems of "do-it-yourself" wills 
<LI>Save on estate taxes 
<LI>Take advantage of opportunities people often overlook  
<LI>Change the terms of your will
</UL>
<STRONG>Points Often Neglected In Drawing Up Wills</STRONG><BR>
In discussions with your lawyer, be sure to ask yourself the following:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Does my will take advantage of the unlimited marital deduction?
<LI>How are estate taxes allocated among beneficiaries?
<LI>Have any precautions been taken to minimize the double taxation of the estate - once at
the death of each spouse?
<LI>Have arrangements been made to establish who legally died first in the event of the
apparent simultaneous death of both spouses?
<LI>Should the executor of my estate have the power to run or dispose of my business?  
<LI>Have all insurance arrangements been considered in your will?
</UL>

<STRONG>Where Does Life Insurance Fit Into The Picture?</STRONG><BR>
Life insurance is a vehicle you can use to make sure the size of your estate is not severely
depleted at death. In most instances, life insurance proceeds are paid income tax free to
your beneficiary(ies). Life insurance proceeds may also be arranged to be estate tax free.
Besides replacing the lost income of a wage earner, the proceeds from a life insurance policy
can provide estate liquidity. They can pay the estate's income taxes, state death taxes,
funeral costs, any outstanding debts, probate costs, and other miscellaneous expenses that
occur at death. <P>
Without life insurance proceeds, a portion of your estate may have to be sold quickly to meet
expenses. This often forces your heirs to sell assets at depressed prices because of the
immediate need for cash. The result: a depletion of your estate and a reduction in the amount
your heirs receive. <P>

<STRONG>The Decision Is Up To You</STRONG><BR>
You spent a lifetime building and gathering your assets. It's up to you to make sure your
assets get distributed the way you want. A will is a tool you can use to achieve this goal.
At New York Life, our agents, in conjunction with your inheritance planning attorney, will
help evaluate your needs and recommend solutions that will maximize your will's potential.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>The Ins and Outs of Annuities</STRONG></FONT><P>



Annuities are sold by life insurance companies to provide benefits during your
lifetime.  An annuity
provides a guaranteed lifetime income that you can elect to have start either
immediately after purchase
or at a future date.
<P>
In general, there are two types of annuities, fixed and variable.  A fixed annuity
provides a specific
income for life.  With a variable annuity, payouts are dependent on investment
return, which is not
guaranteed.  In both fixed and variable annuities, you do not have to pay income
tax on the accumulated
earnings until payouts start.  But you should keep in mind that withdrawals are
taxable and, if you are
under age 59 1/2, may be subject to a 10% tax penalty.
<P>
Payout, when the time comes, may be in one of several forms:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Straight Life Annuity </STRONG>- You receive an income for the rest of
your life. 
However, no payments are
made to anyone, even your dependents, after your death.  This is sometimes called
a
"pure" annuity.  It
provides the largest amount of income per dollar of purchase money.  This type of
annuity is often
recommended for a person who needs the maximum amount of income and either has no
dependents
or has taken care of them through other means.
<LI><STRONG>Joint and Survivor Annuity</STRONG> - Payouts are made for as long as
either you or
your designated survivor
lives.
<LI><STRONG>Installment Refund Annuity</STRONG> - Payouts are somewhat less than
a
straight
life annuity, but they will at
least equal the amount paid in premiums, regardless of when you die; any refund is
paid to your
beneficiary in installments.
<LI><STRONG>Life Annuity with Period Certain</STRONG> - Payouts are made to you
for
your life.
However, this type of annuity
features a "guarantee" provision.  This means that if you die within a certain
period after you start
receiving income, usually 10 or 20 years, your beneficiary will receive regular
payments for the balance
of that period.
</UL>

<P>
Because annuities have many different features, there are a number of factors to
examine before you
buy.  For example you should ask if there are penalties for early withdrawals. 
Are
there graduated
withdrawals charges over a period of years?  How much can you withdraw at any one
time without a
penalty?
<P>
In addition, if you are considering the purchase of an annuity, you should ask:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>What is the current interest rate and how often does it change?
<LI>What is the minimum interest rate guaranteed in the contract?
<LI>Is there a "bailout option" that permits you to cash in the annuity, without
withdrawal penalties (there
may be tax penalties), if the interest rate drops below a specific figure?
<LI>Are there front-end load charges or annual administrative fees?  How much are
they and how will
they affect your return?
</UL>
<P>
Annuities are a popular product, providing an important retirement savings vehicle. 
Consumers should consider carefully their options when purchasing an annuity.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>The Zero Estate Tax Plan</STRONG></FONT><P>

<STRONG>Providing for you, your family, and your community</STRONG><BR>
Conventional wisdom says, "Hold on to what you own as long as possible." Unfortunately, when
it comes to estate taxes, this philosophy could cost your family dearly.<P>
Do you have an estate plan? If so, will it provide benefits you can enjoy in retirement as
well as minimize your estate tax exposure? The following text outlines an innovative estate
planning technique that provides value-added benefits to you and your spouse while alive and
helps take care of your family - and even your community - after you are gone.<P>

<STRONG>The Zero Estate Tax Plan</STRONG><BR>
The zero estate tax plan, when structured properly, will provide you and your spouse with a
lifetime income stream, reduce your current income taxes, and may potentially eliminate your
estate tax exposure. This strategy takes advantage of several tax benefits:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Charitable income tax deduction
<LI>Avoidance of long-term capital gains tax
<LI>Tax-free compounding of assets
<LI>Charitable estate tax deduction
<LI>Tax-free compounding of life insurance cash values
</UL>
To fully understand this strategy, let's examine the case of a hypothetical couple
approaching retirement. Their retirement objectives include visiting their children and
grandchildren, traveling, and becoming more involved in several of their favorite local
charities. Equally important, however, is the need to minimize their estate tax exposure. It
is extremely disheartening for them to know that up to 60% of their estate could go to the
federal government unless the proper steps are taken. In other words, the IRS - not their
family - could be the largest beneficiary of their estate.<P>

This couple has a fairly well diversified portfolio but a considerable portion of it is
illiquid real estate properties. To increase their liquidity and overall
financial security, they are contemplating selling the real estate portion of their
portfolio. However, this could create a significant tax liability.<P>
After assessing the couple's current financial situation, an estate planning professional and
the couple's attorney recommend the following estate plan.<P>

<IMG SRC="/nyl/images/pfepze2.gif" ALT="Chart" ALIGN=RIGHT  BORDER="0"> 
<p>

<STRONG>Step 1: Charitable Remainder Trust</STRONG><BR>
The first step involves the transfer of ownership of the couple's real estate holdings into a
tax-exempt charitable remainder trust. The charitable remainder trust converts a highly
appreciated or low yielding asset (often closely-held stock or real estate) into a lifetime
income stream. Here's how it works: The asset in the trust, in this case real estate (which
must be free from any indebtedness), is sold at a fair market value with the proceeds
reinvested in income-producing assets. Because of the trust's tax-exempt status, the
appreciation from the sale is not subject to capital gains tax. <P>
The trust, in turn, pays the couple a lifetime income stream to supplement their retirement.
Additionally, the contribution to the trust qualifies for a partial income tax charitable
deduction, subject to IRS rules, thereby reducing the couple's current income tax bill (This
calculation is based on actuarial assumptions to determine the charitable remainderman's
split interest at the end of the income beneficiary's life expectancy. At death, any
remaining assets in the trust will pass to the charities of their choice). The tax savings
and new income stream will improve this couple's retirement cash flow.<P>

<STRONG>Step 2: Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust</STRONG><BR>
Next, the couple establishes an irrevocable life insurance trust. This accomplishes two
goals: 1) Provides heirs with estate tax-free benefits upon death by using life insurance to
fund the trust; 2) Purchases a sufficient amount of life insurance to replace the value of
the asset transferred to the charitable remainder trust by utilizing the savings resulting
from the charitable income tax deduction with a portion of the income stream. So, the heirs
are made "whole."<P>
In this instance, the trust purchases survivorship whole life insurance or "second-to-die"
insurance. Survivorship whole life insurance covers the lives of  two individuals in one
insurance policy and pays the death benefit after the death of the second insured. As a
result, the cost is more affordable than purchasing two separate life insurance policies. In
addition to avoiding estate taxes, the proceeds will also avoid probate expenses since the
assets pass under the terms of the trust.<P>

<STRONG>Step 3: Unified Tax Credit</STRONG><BR>
The unified tax credit allows each spouse to give $600,000 to anyone they choose, whenever
they choose, gift and estate tax-free. The unified gift and estate tax credit of $192,800 is
equal to an exemption of $600,000. By gifting money and property to their children and
grandchildren while they are alive, the income and the appreciation of the gifted assets is
not part of their estate when they die. As a result of utilizing the unified 
tax credit, the couple can decrease the value of their estate by $1.2 million and save their
heirs close to $400,000 in estate taxes.<P>

<IMG SRC="/nyl/images/pfepze.gif" ALT="Chart" ALIGN=RIGHT  BORDER="0">
<p>

<STRONG>A Win-Win Situation</STRONG><BR>
As you can see, a properly structured zero estate tax plan can benefit everyone - you, your
spouse, children, and charity.<P>
<UL>
<LI>Transferring a highly appreciated or low yielding asset into a charitable remainder trust
creates an income and avoids any capital gains tax. In addition, the charitable income tax
deduction reduces your current income taxes.
<LI>The irrevocable life insurance trust replaces the value of the asset gifted to charity
and your beneficiaries receive more than if you were to sell the asset and pay capital gains
and estate taxes. The life insurance proceeds are generally free from income and estate
taxes.
<LI>The unified tax credit provides an effective means of redistributing your wealth while
further reducing your estate tax exposure.
<LI>Finally, you will be able to give one or more charities a significant gift.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>These Five Insurance and Financial Mistakes Can Cost You
Dearly</STRONG></FONT><P>




Everyone wants financial success for themselves and their families.  The dreams
that we spend long
hours working towards - whether it's a first home, a college education for the
children, or a retirement
home some place warm - these are all goals on the path to financial security. 
Unfortunately, it's all too
easy to stumble on the way to your destination.  I've compiled a list of what I've
found to be the most
common errors people make in their insurance and financial planning.  They're all
potentially costly,
and they could mean the difference between financial success and failure.
<P>
<OL>

<LI><STRONG>Failure to Plan</STRONG> - An old saying goes:  "Most people don't plan
to fail, they
fail
to plan."  This is
particularly true when it comes to insurance and finances.  If any planning is done
it's on a piecemeal
basis, but that's just not enough.  To have a shot at accomplishing what we want,
we must first set our
goals, analyze what it will take to achieve those goals, and then implement a plan. 
The plan should
include everything from savings and checking accounts, to longer term vehicles like
annuities, CDs, IRAs, and the protection provided by life, health, and disability income
insurance.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Insufficient Diversification</STRONG> - Another old adage still rings
true:  "Don't put all
your eggs in one basket." 
Diversification is generally considered a key to reducing risk and enhancing
potential return.  Some
people believe that because they have CDs in three different banks they're properly
diversified.  True
diversification cuts across product types, lengths of maturity, and asset
categories.  With a well
diversified portfolio, you're never too dependent on how well one product performs.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Insufficient Life Insurance</STRONG> - We're quick to insure our cars
and our homes,
but too often we overlook
our most important asset - ourselves.  With mortgages, tuitions, and bills to be
paid, it's important to
have proper coverage on all income earners.  Some people may have group term life
insurance through
their employers, but this alone may not be sufficient.  Be careful not to be overly
dependent on group
term, for these plans can be inflexible, may not be portable, and may not be
available when you need them
most - after age 65.  Look into purchasing individual coverage that can be
customized to suit your
particular needs.  How much life insurance is enough?  That depends on a number of
personal factors
including income and number of dependents.  It's best to sit down with a
professional to go over your
needs and look at the available options.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Inadequate Disability Income Insurance</STRONG> - Your earning power is
the
generator that keeps the
wheels of your household running smoothly.  But what if that generator breaks down? 
The risk of
disability, as well as its potential cost, is simply too great to ignore.  Once
again, a company-sponsored
plan may be too limited for your needs.  Typically, disability income insurance
plans will cover 50 - 60%
of your annual income for a pre-determined period of time.  You'll want to study
the policy carefully to
understand all of the provisions, including the definition of disability, the
waiting period following
disability before you can collect, and the length of the payment period.  
<P>
<LI><STRONG>No Estate Plan</STRONG> - Some people have the impression that estate
planning is
just for the rich. 
Unfortunately, that view can be costly 
to their heirs.  Your estate includes such items as your home, cash, investments,
personal property,
and other assets you and your spouse may own jointly or as community property. 
These may add up to
a lot more than you thought you were worth.  Federal estate taxes begin at 37% for
estates valued at
more than $600,000 and can climb as high as 60% for larger estates.  Add in state
death taxes and
final expenses and your death can be quite costly to your loved ones.  You owe it
to your family to have
an estate plan in place.  An effective will, a trust arrangement, and adequate life
insurance are some of
the options available to you to help your heirs get what they deserve.  Consult
your tax, legal, and
financial advisors for help in putting together an estate plan.
<P>
</OL>
"To err is human" is yet another pearl of wisdom.  Sure, everyone makes mistakes,
but all of the ones
outlined above can be avoided.  With proper insurance and financial needs planning you
can steer past those
costly blunders and be on the road to financial success.

disability before you can collect, and the length of the payment period.  
<P>
<LI><STRONG>No Estate Plan</STRONG> - Some people have the impression that estate
planning is
just for the rich. 
Unfortunately, that view can be costly 
to their heirs.  Your estate includes such items as your home, cash, investments,
personal property,
and other assets you and your spouse may own jointly or as community property. 
These may add up to
a lot more than you thought you were worth.  Federal estate taxes begin at 37% for
estates valued at
more than ,000 and can climb as high as 60% for larger estates.  Add in state
death taxes and
final expenses and your death can be quite costly to your loved ones.  You owe it
to your family to have
an estate plan in place.  An effective will, a trust arrangement, and adequate life
insurance are some of
the options available to you to help your heirs get what they deserve.  Consult
your tax, legal, and
financial advisors for help in putting together an estate plan.
<P>
</OL>
"To err is human" is yet another pearl of wisdom.  Sure, everyone makes mistakes,
but all of the ones
outlined above can be avoided.  With proper insurance and planning you
can steer past those
costly blunders and be on the road to financial success.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Tips on Purchasing Life Insurance</STRONG></FONT><P>


Buying life insurance is not in the same category as getting a new car or spring wardrobe, it
is a lot
more complex and infinitely more important.  The primary reason individuals purchase life
insurance is
to protect the financial security of their loved ones.  It makes good sense then to use the
same care in
buying life insurance as you would when making any significant purchase.  And whether you
are looking
for a new home or a state-of-the-art stereo system, shopping around for the product that best
meets
your needs is most important.  Life insurance is no exception.
<P>
Before you begin your search for a life insurance policy, it is important to do some
preparation.  To help
you determine the amount of insurance you need, you should identify your dependents (this
may
include children, parents, spouse), your financial obligations and resources.  This way, in the
event of
your death, your family will have the financial resources it needs to continue to run a
household.  A
company representative or agent can help you find the right type and amount of insurance
for your
family's needs at an affordable price.
<P>
In addition, here are 10 things you should do to help you and your family make the most
appropriate life
insurance purchase:
<P>
<OL>
<P><LI>Make sure your agent and company are licensed to do business in your state.  Call your
state
insurance department if you are not sure.
<P><LI>Take your time.  Make sure you understand fully any policy you are considering and
that you are
comfortable with the company, agent and product.  Do not rush into a decision just because
you are
feeling pressured.  On the other hand, do not put off an important decision that protects your
family.  If
you have any questions - ask!
<P><LI>Ask your agent if the company offers any "healthy lifestyle" discounts on your policy. 
For example,
nonsmokers can save from 10% to 20% on their premiums.  This discount can even apply to
ex-smokers if enough years have passed since quitting!
<P><LI>Do not omit any part of your medical history on your life insurance application.  If you
do, the
company may be able to refuse coverage, deny a claim or cancel the policy.
<P><LI>Read the insurance contract carefully and, if necessary, ask your agent for a
point-by-point
explanation of the language.  Insurance policies are legal documents and you should be
familiar with
what they promise, even though some technical terms are used.
<P><LI>Expect delivery of your life insurance policy within two weeks of purchase.  If it does not
arrive,
contact the company for a written explanation.
<P><LI>Remember that you may have a 10-day "free-look" period that entitles you to change
your mind
about purchasing the policy.  If you do so, the company will return your premium, without
penalty.
<P><LI>Write the check for your insurance premium to the company, not the agent.  Be sure you
are given a
receipt.  Pay premiums annually or semiannually, rather than monthly or quarterly, if
possible.  That
way, the company saves money by billing you less frequently, and the savings are passed
on to you 
(Also, look into "electronic" billing arrangements that authorize the insurance company to
automatically
withdraw premiums from your bank account.  This can relieve you of the burdensome task of
having to
write regular checks).
<P><LI>Inform your beneficiaries about the kind, amount and location of any life insurance
policies you
own.  Keep your policy in a safe place at home and, in addition, keep your insurance
company's name
and your policy number in a safe deposit box.
<P><LI>Review your life insurance coverage at least once every two years to be sure it meets
your current
needs.  Be cautious if another agent or company contacts you and wants you to cancel your
current
policy to buy a new one.  Contact your original agent or company before making any
decisions. 
All things considered, when you are purchasing life insurance, shop carefully, ask
questions, and make
sure you understand the answers.  You would do the same with any other product or service
that you
buy.

Mark Twain once commented that everybody loves to talk about the
weather, but
unfortunately
no one does anything about it.  His quip would seem to apply equally
well to
retirement
planning.  Consider the following statistics:<P>

According to a 1994 Princeton Survey Research Associates' survey, "Concerns of Adults in Their
Pre-Retirement Years," the overwhelming majority of men and women aged 45 to 59 are unprepared for a
financially comfortable retirement.  In fact, 85% of those surveyed anticipate that they will not have
enough
to retire at all, or will have just enough to get by.<P>

In addition, the 1994 survey by the Princeton Survey Research Associates indicates that the situation
is
getting worse.  The rate of retirement savings is actually declining.  It dropped 8% from 1993 to 1994
and
was down a total of 34% over a three-year period. A report by the benefits consulting firm of
Goodwins,
Booke and Dickenson stated that a third of all baby boomers have less than $10,000 saved.<P>

Perhaps most seriously, many people aren't doing much about their own retirement needs.  In fact, the
majority of Americans seem to be ignoring the situation.  According to figures reported in <I>The
Kiplinger
Washington Letter</I> (July 1, 1994), about one in five households has no savings whatsoever.  Of
those
that do, the median amount is just $10,000.<P>

Don't count on too much help from the government.  At best, Social
Security will
contribute
only a part of the monthly income you need.  The current monthly
maximum is less
than $1,250 for someone age 65 retiring in 1996, who has never been disabled.

It's likely that even this level of benefits will have
been shrunk by the time fifty-year olds reach retirement age.  And don't forget how
Medicare
benefits have changed over the years.  You'd do best to think of
government
benefits as a
bonus to your retirement plan, not as a substitute.<P>
Begin at the end:  What do you want to do during your retirement?  How
do you
envision your
retirement lifestyle?  Now assign an approximate dollar value to that
lifestyle: 
given your
(1) current wealth, (2) income, (3) savings, and (4) rate of savings,
how much of
your
retirement dream will you be able to afford?	This initial approach
is admittedly
the most
sobering and least fun part of retirement planning.  Here you are
likely to
discover that
your future dreams and current means may be, shall we say, more than a
little bit
out of
synch.<P>
The question is, must you adjust your dreams to your means, or can you
manage those
means to
realize your dreams?  At a minimum, the resources available to you upon
retirement
should be
sufficient to (1) provide adequate retirement income and (2) fund
desired bequests. 
Other
important long-term goals, such as meeting educational and other
dependent needs,
must also
be considered.<P>
Retirement planning focuses on what can be done today to realize
long-term
financial goals. 
It is not a one-time act, but many related ones: budgeting, saving,
investing,
income tax
planning, dependent needs planning, and estate planning.  These
endeavors revolve
around one
main consideration - the very essence of retirement planning - namely,
taking
action to
accelerate the growth of wealth.  What can you do to realize your
retirement
dreams?  What
can you do to increase the growth of your wealth?<P>
The most obvious way to increase wealth is to increase income. 
Planning
constraints can
often be eased by an increase in salary, whether this is achieved by
negotiating a
raise,
assuming additional responsibilities, or training for a more lucrative
position. 
Some
professionals might consider part-time self-employment.  Employment or
self-employment income
earned by other family members can also make a significant contribution
to
retirement
savings.<P>
Adhering to a well-conceived and disciplined budget allows you to
better anticipate
how much
money you'll have for retirement purposes, and how you can allocate it. 
Budgeting
also
enables you to control interest (debt) expenses.  You can increase your
income by
repaying
any credit card or life insurance loan debts.<P>
You should also make a firm commitment to "forced savings":  Take
maximum advantage
of your
firm's 401(k), T.S.A., S.E.P., or other qualified pension plan. 
Purchasing cash
value life
insurance is another not-to-be-overlooked method of forced savings.<P>
One more suggestion:  Take a good a look at your taxes.  Tax planning
lets you
reduce tax
liabilities - a worthy goal in itself - and also enhances your
investment
options.<P>
The first way to increase your wealth through investments is simply to
allocate
more of your
assets to investments.  You've go to play to win, and you've got to
invest to
prosper.  By
increasing the amount you invest relative to your personal and liquid
assets, you
improve the
weighted average return on your assets.  By diversifying your
investment portfolio,
you
reduce its risk exposure.   By assuming intelligent risks, you improve
the
long-term total
return on your investments.  Investing more intelligently, and more
profitably, is
made
possible with mutual funds.  Funds offer professional management of
your invested
dollars, as
well as diversification across country, industry, and company lines,
and between
types of
securities.  "Money makes money," said Ben Franklin, "and the money
that money
makes, makes
more money."  In the end, there are but two (legal) ways to increase
wealth - you
can work
for it and you can put it to work for you.  You can earn, and you can
invest. 
These two ways
to increase wealth are not alternatives but complements.  Indeed, the
better job
you do
making money - maximizing income and controlling expenses - the greater
are your
options in
making that money make more money for you.<P>
	Mark Twain aside, you can't do anything about the weather. 
Retirement, too, is
inevitable, but you can do something about it.  Start planning now.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Understanding Insurance Company Ratings*</STRONG></FONT><P>

Frequently, discussions of insurance/financial products will mention the importance of
ratings when deciding which company to choose.  Ratings are determined by the research of
several prominent services, which conduct in-depth examinations of an insurer's financial
condition and assign it a grade.  As a consumer, you may be considering (or already own)
financial products from different companies.  It's always useful to know who the main ratings
services are, how insurance companies are rated in regard to their financial strength, and
exactly what those ratings mean.<P>  

Although different ratings companies use different formulas, there are common elements that
are examined to arrive at a rating.  These include: the composition and quality of a
company's assets; liquidity (the extent to which a company can utilize liquid assets to meet
its cash needs); investment performance; and quality of management.<P>  

While each of the ratings services has its own criteria for measurement -- and offers an
assessment based on its educated opinion -- taken as a group, ratings services can be used as a
starting point to develop an accurate picture of an insurance company.  These findings are
easily available to the general public (most can be looked up at the library) and can play an
important role in determining which company to trust with your hard-earned cash.<P>

<FONT SIZE="-1">*Ratings do not apply to the performance of variable products, which will fluctuate with market conditions. </FONT><P>

Below are brief descriptions of the four major ratings services and the factors they use
to review insurance companies. <P>

<STRONG>A.M. Best Company</STRONG><BR>
Located in Oldwick, NJ, A.M. Best has been reporting on insurance companies for over 90
years. 
It rates almost 1,400 companies annually for financial strength, operating performance, and
ability to meet obligations to policyholders.  Ratings range from a high of A++ (superior) to
a low of F (in liquidation).  Best looks at several factors, including profitability,
leverage, and liquidity.  It also evaluates the company's management, as well as the quality
and diversification of investments and the adequacy of reserves.  (Best also has a
policyholder confidence factor that measures a company's ability to withstand a policyholder
"run.")<P>

<STRONG>Duff &amp; Phelps</STRONG><BR>
Duff &amp; Phelps reviews insurance companies annually to determine their "claims-paying
ability."  The top rating is AAA (highest claims-paying ability; risk negligible), the lowest
two are CCC (substantial risk) and DD (in liquidation).  In assessing companies, Duff &amp;
Phelps looks at annual statements, historical growth and ratios, economic base of the
company's principal insurance lines, competitive position, and management capability.<P> 

<STRONG>Moody's</STRONG><BR>
Based in New York City, Moody's rates the financial strength of domestic companies.  Moody's evaluates the company's financial capacity to meet the
obligations of its insurance policies over the short and long term.  In reviewing a company,
Moody's considers several factors, including quality of assets, business and product mix,
management style, and strategy of the company.<P>

<STRONG>Standard and Poor's </STRONG><BR>
This New York City-based company has been rating insurers for over 20 years and reviews life
insurance companies at least annually to ascertain "claims-paying ability."  Ratings can
range from a high of AAA (superior financial security) to a low of R (in liquidation).  Standard
and Poor's looks at several factors, including how a company's assets are allocated, industry
risk, and current portfolio yield, and assesses the company's ability to withstand competition
from an unexpected source.  It also examines management, corporate strategy, liquidity, and
flexibility.<P>


It's important to remember that the rating a company receives from a service is an opinion,
not a statement of fact or a guarantee.  Thus, when considering a purchase from any insurance
company, consumers are well advised not to rely on one rating service but to look at two or
more.  (In many instances, slight grade differences within a category are not generally
significant; however, a full letter difference might be.)  While ratings are important, they
should also be considered in the larger picture of the quality of the products and services
the agent and company provide.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Universal Life Ideas </STRONG></FONT><P>

Universal life provides permanent life
insurance protection and
access to cash values that grow tax-deferred at competitive interest rates. 

Universal life (Target Life) policies are issued by New York Life Insurance
and Annuity
Corporation (A Delaware Corporation), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of New
York Life Insurance
Company.
<P>

<STRONG>Versatile Tools to Suit Your Changing Needs</STRONG><BR>

<STRONG>Flexible Protection</STRONG><BR>
Universal life gives you the flexibility to choose the amount of protection that
best suits your family or
business.  It allows you to increase or decrease coverage as insurance needs
change.  
Increased coverage may be subject to underwriting requirements.  You may not
decrease your
coverage below the required minimum.  A decrease may result in a surrender charge
being applied
against the policy's cash value.
<P>
<STRONG>Flexible Premiums</STRONG> <BR>
With universal life, you control the amount and frequency of payments.  Looking
towards the future?  You
have the option to increase the premium or make lump sum contributions, subject
to limits as
specified in the policy. The extra dollars grow tax-deferred, and may increase
the cash and death
benefit values.  On the other hand, in a temporary cash crunch, you can pay less
than the scheduled
premium and let the policy's accumulated cash value pay the remainder of the
monthly charges.  
<P>
<STRONG>Flexible Design</STRONG><BR>
Universal life can be customized with innovative policy features to fit your
lifestyle.  Ask your New York
Life representative how universal life policy riders can protect your spouse and
children, protect your
ability to pay premiums during disability, and increase the benefit to your family
if you should die
accidentally.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Variable Deferred Annuities</STRONG></FONT><P>

	Variable deferred annuities are often said to combine the best advantages of mutual
funds with the tax-deferred growth of an annuity.  These annuities usually offer a choice of
several types of investments that purchase shares of stock, bond, money market, and
specialty funds.  The owner may select how to allocate the policy's cash value and is able to
transfer money among these investment options.  A variable annuity may  offer investors
opportunities for higher potential growth than is usually available with a fixed interest
investment.<P>
	For investors who seek the professional fund management and asset diversification
that
is available with a mutual fund, but who prefer always to defer immediate income tax on
their
gains, a variable annuity may be the perfect solution.<P>
	An unusual feature found only in variable annuities is the guaranteed death benefit. 
The value of a variable annuity death benefit is guaranteed never to be less than the total
of the premiums paid, less any withdrawals that have occurred.

The Indexed Equity Portfolio invests in the stocks represented in the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500
Composite
Price Index (S&amp;P 500)<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="#1">1</A></FONT></SUP>. By
investing in
the same stocks, and in the same proportion as the S&amp;P 500, the
portfolio seeks to achieve investment results that correspond to the total return
of the
stock market as
represented by the S&amp;P 500. This investment option may be right for you if you are
willing to
bear the
risks associated with the stock market in exchange for a return that may mirror the
market's<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="#2">2</A></FONT></SUP>. (Managed
by Monitor Capital Advisors Inc.)
<P>
<STRONG>Growth Equity</STRONG><BR>
The Growth Equity Portfolio invests principally in common stock of
well-established,
well-managed
companies. These stocks may have the potential for above-average growth. This
portfolio seeks
long-term growth of capital, with dividend income secondary to its objective.
Consider this
investment
alternative if you want the opportunity for above-average capital growth, while
accepting the
risks
associated with the stock market. (Managed by New York Life Insurance Company)

<STRONG>Capital Appreciation</STRONG><BR>
The Capital Appreciation Portfolio seeks long-term growth of capital. Stocks
expected to
appreciate in
value are selected for this portfolio. Dividend income, if any, is incidental to
this
portfolio's objective.
This investment option may suit you if you are willing to assume greater risk for a
potentially greater
return on your investment. (Managed by MacKay-Shields Financial Corporation)

<STRONG>High Yield Corporate Bond</STRONG><BR>
The High Yield Corporate Bond Portfolio seeks to maximize current income and
secondarily
seeks
growth from capital appreciation. It invests in high yield debt securities which
are often
rated in the
lower categories by the rating agencies. These securities are commonly referred to
as high
yield
securities or junk bonds. This portfolio may be appropriate if you are seeking a
high
potential return and
are willing to assume greater risk. (Managed by MacKay-Shields Financial
Corporation)

<STRONG>International Equity</STRONG><BR>
The International Equity Portfolio seeks long-term growth of capital. It invests in
a portfolio of primarily non-U.S. equity securities. The portfolio tries to diversify across a variety of
countries and will be
invested in a minimum of five countries, exclusive of the United States. Consider this investment option
if you wish to diversify by including non-U.S. investments in your portfolio and if
you are willing to assume the risks associated with international investing <SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Variable Universal Life: Moderate Investment
Options</STRONG></FONT><P>


<STRONG>Government</STRONG><BR>
The Government Portfolio seeks a high level of current income consistent with
safety of
principal. It
invests primarily in U.S. government securities, including Treasury bills, notes,
and bonds,
and
obligations of the U.S. government or its agencies. Although the securities held
within this
portfolio are
guaranteed by the U.S. government or an agency, the value of the portfolio's shares
is not
insured and
will fluctuate. Choose this investment alternative if you seek a conservative
investment with
relatively low
risk. (Managed by MacKay-Shields Financial Corporation)
<P>
<STRONG>Bond</STRONG><BR>
The Bond Portfolio invests primarily in investment grade, fixed-income securities
including
U.S.
government bonds, U.S. government agency obligations and corporate bonds. This fund
may also
invest in lower-rated securities, convertible debt, and preferred stock. By
investing in
various grades of
debt securities, this portfolio seeks to earn long-term income while preserving
capital. You
should
consider this investment option if you want a relatively conservative approach to
income and
capital
preservation and are willing to accept some market risk. (Managed by New York Life
Insurance
Company)
<P>
<STRONG>Total Return</STRONG><BR>
The Total Return Portfolio seeks to realize current income consistent with
reasonable
opportunity for
future growth of capital and income. It invests in a combination of stocks, bonds,
or money
market
instruments, depending on market conditions. By investing in a broad range of
securities,
this portfolio
seeks to reduce the risks associated with market volatility. This investment
alternative may
be right for
you if you want the opportunity for attractive growth and income while accepting
some risk
exposure.
(Managed by MacKay-Shields Financial Corporation)
<P>
<STRONG>Value</STRONG><BR>
The Value Portfolio seeks to realize maximum long-term total return from a
combination of
capital
growth and income investments. It invests in common stocks which are, in the
portfolio
manager's
opinion, undervalued at the time of purchase. The portfolio typically invests in
dividend-paying stocks,
but will also invest in non-dividend paying stocks. This portfolio may be right for
you if
you are seeking
an equity investment that focuses on growth from both capital appreciation and
dividend
income, and if
you are willing to assume the associated risks. (Managed by MacKay-Shields
Financial
Corporation)<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>How Much Life Insurance Do You Need?</STRONG></FONT><P>
 
 
The main purpose of life insurance is to provide financial security for your
family.  It helps to ensure that
when you die your family will have the financial resources it needs to provide for
your spouse, children,
an elderly parent or some other dependent.  However, life insurance also may be
used to meet a variety
of long-term financial goals.  It can help provide educational funds for your
children or funds for your
own retirement.  The question that most families and individuals have, then, is
"How much life
insurance do I need?"  The answer depends largely on your family's individual
circumstances.<P>
There are no hard and fast rules for determining how much life insurance is enough,
because no two
families have exactly the same needs. You may be single, supporting no one but
yourself.  Or, you may
be supporting an elderly mother or father.  You may have several children, but also
two incomes and
considerable net worth.  Or, you may have several children, be dependent on one
income and have few
back-up resources.<P>
Whatever your situation, if you are providing financial support for people who are
depending on you, you
need life insurance.  However, there are several things to consider when you buy
life insurance, since
the proceeds can be used with several goals in mind.  For example, proceeds can:<P>
<UL>
<P><LI>Provide ready cash for final expenses:  These could include funeral costs,
medical 	expenses,
probate fees, and estate taxes.
<P><LI>Pay off outstanding debts: not only hospital bills, for example, but a mortgage
or an 	auto loan.
<P><LI>Provide replacement income in amounts necessary to cover:
<UL>
<P><LI>A readjustment period of two or three years after your death.  If you are a 
two-income family, it takes
time to adjust to one paycheck instead of two.  If you 	are the sole wage earner,
with young children
at
home, your spouse's need for a 	readjustment period is obvious.
<P><LI>The period while children under age 18 still are at home and dependent.  	
(Social Security benefits that may be available supply only part of your family's 
income needs.)
<P><LI>The college years, when Social Security benefits for dependents come to an 	end
just as expenses
grow.
<P><LI>The years between the time the youngest child becomes independent and the 
time the
surviving
spouse reaches retirement age.
<P><LI>The period after the survivor retires and receives Social Security or a
pension.
	</UL>
	</UL>
	<P>
In general, determining how much life insurance you need means deducting the sum
total of the
income that would be lost upon the insured's death from the sum total of your
family's ongoing
financial need.  It also means calculating the impact of inflation (usually
assuming 5% per year) and
building in enough "extra" to counteract inflation's effects.  It may seem
complicated, but it is an exercise
that is well worth doing.  It is also one that you do not have to tackle alone.<P>
A life insurance agent or licensed financial planner can help determine how much
life insurance your
family will need over time, based on the extent of your financial responsibilities
and the kinds and
amounts of your other resources.<P>
It may be that the solution to your insurance needs may entail using a combination
of several plans,
and the combination may need to be changed as your situation changes.  
Fortunately, life insurance is flexible - with several types of plans available -
and an agent can work with
you to determine what products will best fit your ongoing needs and future goals. <P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>What Are Your Goals?</STRONG></FONT><P>


Most people want more money.  But if you're setting an investment goal, it helps to
be more
specific. 
Do you want to retire with a million dollars in twenty-five years?  Are you hoping
to make a
down-payment on a $100,000 house in five years?  Would you like to earn at least
three
percent more
than the inflation rate over the next ten years?
<P>
	Specific goals make it easier to see if your investments are on course - and
easier to
adjust them if
they start to fall behind.  It's fine to want financial independence.  But
translating that into a
specific
dollar amount and a definite time frame can help you decide what's realistic and
what's just
a dream.

	The kinds of investments that are right for you will depend largely on how you feel
about risk and
reward.  While most people want low risk and high returns, that combination may be difficult
to find.<P>

	As you can see from this chart, over time, common stocks have substantially
outperformed
long-term
government bonds, as well as Treasury bills, and outpaced inflation.  The chart also shows
that over
short periods, stocks have had more ups and downs than fixed income securities, subjecting
investors
to greater risk.  While bonds and Treasury bills tend to provide relatively stable income, their
returns
also may vary with changes in interest rates.  As a general rule, investments with a higher
return
potential tend to involve more risk, and low-risk investments tend to provide lower returns. 
However,
past performance is not a guarantee of future results.

Common stock performance is measured by the S&P 500, an unmanaged index considered to be generally representative of the U.S. stock market. Long-term government bond performance is measured by a
one-bond portfolio with a 20-year maturity and current coupon. U.S. Treasury bill performance is based
on a one-bill portfolio with the shortest maturity not less than one month.
Inflation is measured by the
Consumer Price Index (CPI), which shows the changes in the cost of selected goods. It should be noted that T-bills and long-term government bonds are backed by the federal government (i.e., principal and interest and principal, respectively) where stocks are not.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>What Exactly is an Annuity?</STRONG></FONT><P>

What exactly is an annuity, and why does someone buy one?  An annuity contract is
purchased
from an insurance company.  The money in the contract earns interest and provides
a
periodic
income at regular intervals for a specified period of time (i.e., a number of
years
or for
life).  Most often, it is used as a vehicle for saving for retirement or to
guarantee an
income for life.  An annuity is often used for special savings plans that are
provided by
some employers, such as:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Tax Sheltered Annuities (TSAs), (salary reduction plans for employees of
public
schools
and non-profit organizations),
<LI>Section 457 Plans (deferred compensation plans for public employees), and
<LI>Simplified Employee Pensions  (SEPs).

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>What is Your Business Worth?</STRONG></FONT><P>

	In 1973, Jack Kraft turned a hobby into a business by starting a small nursery and
garden supply
shop.  Today he sells trees, flowers, garden implements, and landscaping services. 
Jack's wife, Mary, keeps the books and helps with customers.  Jack's
college-age
children, James and Helen, both plan to work in the business full time some day.  Jack
doesn't talk
much about money, but it's clear that the family is doing well.<P>
	What is Kraft Nursery worth?  And why does it matter?  It matters to Jack, for several
good
reasons.<P>
	Some day Jack and Mary will both be gone.  The nursery will be included in their
estates.  Estate
taxes - at marginal rates, which can go as high as fifty-five percent - will be due based on the
value of
the total estate, including the business.  Jack doesn't know what it is worth, but the IRS will
arrive at a
value.  If the family doesn't have the cash to pay estate taxes, the business may have to be
liquidated,
perhaps for far less than its value.  By knowing the value today, Jack and Mary can begin to
arrange for
the orderly transfer of the business at their respective deaths.<P>
	"What's the business worth?"  It all depends on the way the question is posed.  What is
the
business
worth today, with Jack running it?  And what would the business be worth were Jack to be
disabled?
And what will the business be worth once Jack dies? If Jack does decide to "hedge" that
potential loss,
the money from his key person insurance can provide funds his family needs to keep the
business
ticking along.<P>
	Eighteen years ago, Jack was a young man with ability and dreams, but little money. 
He started
the
nursery on an "even steven" basis with an uncle, Allen Conroy.  Allen, who is now sixty-six,
is the silent
partner who put up the money.  Jack and Allen split profits after salaries and expenses are
paid.  The
business is so successful that Allen has not worked in years.  A while back, his first wife
died.  Last
year Allen married Lisa, who is at least a generation younger.  Allen and Lisa travel a good
deal and
spend money "like it's going out of style."  When Lisa is in town, she makes a point of
reviewing the
books.  Mary and Lisa are not on good terms.<P>
	What will happen when Allen or Jack dies? At the death of either partner, a partnership
is
dissolved.
The two families will then have the option of liquidating the assets and dividing the
proceeds, or forming
a new partnership.  Can the heirs, however, work together as effectively as the original
partners?  The
idea of Mary and Lisa in partnership is not attractive to either of them.<P>
	Buy-and-sell agreements exist to solve business problems like these.  Under a
buy-and-sell
agreement, Allen would agree to sell his interest in the nursery to Jack at death.  That way
Lisa would
get money, and the Krafts would get the nursery.  Normally, a buy-and-sell would have Jack
sell his
interest at death to Allen.  Here, however, that may not be the best solution.  Allen doesn't
want to run
the nursery, and Mary and the children would not want to be the Conroys' employees.  At
Jack's death, it
might be better for Allen's interest to be purchased by Mary and the children.<P>
	For a buy-and-sell to work, at least three things are needed:  A value must be placed on
the
business; a legal agreement for sale and purchase must be drawn by an attorney; and funds
must be
provided.  If Allen and Jack are insurable, they may find that life insurance is the most
cost-efficient
solution.  Whatever the ultimate source of funding, the search for a workable business
continuation
plan begins by setting a realistic value on the business itself.<P>
	Experts in business valuation, and the IRS, weigh many variables to arrive at a
defensible figure. 
Relevant questions include the following:<P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>What are the assets and liabilities of the business?  Are the assets reflected at
current market
value?
	<LI>What price would the owners accept for the business?  At what price would they
purchase a
similar firm?
	<LI>What is the worth of the firm's "good will," the tendency of customers suppliers to
continue their
favorable relationship with the firm?
	<LI>Are owner-employees drawing "market wages," or are salaries implicitly increased
to reflect a
return on their ownership interest?
	<LI>What is the firm's earning history?  Do the firm's earnings vary greatly from year to
year?  Are
earnings growing?  Do earnings on the books accurately reflect the true earning power of
the
business?
	<LI>What is the firm's competitive position?  Does it have a sustainable competitive
advantage?
</UL>
<P>

	The complexity of valuing a business, planning an estate, and drawing up a
buy-and-sell, all call
for
expert professional advisors.  A first step, however, and one which can be free, is to have a
preliminary
estimate run on business valuation software.  Such a program is no substitute for the work of
a CPA, or
a professional valuation expert, but it represents an important beginning.  With such
software
provided
as a service by their insurance agent, the Krafts and Conroys arrived at several estimates. 
Using a
weighted average, the families and their advisors decided the nursery was worth about one
and one
half million dollars.  The Krafts and Conroys are now working with their attorney and CPA on
a
buy-and-sell agreement and on overall estate plans.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>What to Do When Someone Dies</STRONG></FONT><BR>
<STRONG>Making The Necessary Arrangements</STRONG>
<P>



The death of a family member or close personal friend is a difficult subject for
almost everyone.  The
tendency is to postpone dealing with it until the time comes.  Unfortunately, when
it does, survivors are
expected to make many crucial financial and legal decisions.
<P>
For a grieving  and unprepared person, the pressure to make these decisions can
seem
overwhelming.  It need not be.  Preparation is the key.
<P>
<STRONG>Contact a Funeral Director</STRONG><BR>
Following the death of a loved one, families usually rely upon the funeral director
for guidance.  It is
important that this person be involved immediately because he or she can begin to
help you make
arrangements for funeral services and burials.
<P>
<STRONG>Contact Your Life Insurance Agent</STRONG><BR>
You should also contact the deceased's life insurance agent. In most cases, life
insurance companies
require only two forms to establish proof of claim: a claimant's statement and a
death certificate or an
attending physician's statement.  The claimant's statement must be completed by the
beneficiary.
If you are the beneficiary, you'll be facing crucial financial decisions at a time
when you may be least
prepared to make sound financial decisions.  To add to the burden, the amount of
money involved may
be very large.  For this reason, many companies, including New York Life, offer an
interest-bearing
money market-type account that allows you to write checks against your benefit
proceeds the same day
you receive your checkbook.  This provides immediate access to and complete control
of your
proceeds, while they earn a competitive rate of interest and a guarantee of
principal by the insurer.  It
gives you the time you need to evaluate your changed financial situation and to
talk things over with
your
trusted advisors.
<P>
<STRONG>Contact a Legal Advisor</STRONG><BR>
When a loved one dies, you should seek legal advice on such matters as re-recording
property deeds
and the disposition of stocks, bonds, and savings.  Also, the disbursement of the
insured's business
and estate assets, and the drawing up of a will for the widow or widower, will
require immediate
attention.
<P>
<STRONG>Locate Important Papers</STRONG><BR>
Aside from any insurance policies, remember to think about safe-deposit boxes,
business
agreements, bankbooks, and securities certificates; real estate deeds; wills;
recent copies of income
tax return forms, W-2 forms and other records of earning; Social Security number;
marriage and birth
certificates; military discharge papers, Veterans Administration claim number;
automobile registration;
and installment payment books.  The death certificate is the basic document you
will be working with. 
You'll need a number of copies, so you can establish claims under life insurance
policies and file for
Social Security and Veterans benefits.  In many cases, the funeral director can
secure certified copies.
<P>
<STRONG>Visit Trust Officer and Tax Attorney</STRONG><BR>
A local trust officer is an important resource for survivors.  This individual is
an expert financial advisor
who deals in investments, estate settlements, and household finances.  A tax
attorney or CPA should
be consulted if you think that the deceased's estate might be subject to federal
taxation.
<P>
<STRONG>Contact Employer</STRONG><BR>
Be sure to contact immediately the deceased's place of employment.  Since most
people are covered
by group insurance where they work, inquire about the benefit due you and how to
file a claim.  Also,
ask about pension fund benefits, accrued vacation and sick pay, terminal pay
allowances, disability
income, and credit union balances.  Pay special attention to the deceased's
hospital, surgical, and
disability coverages to see whether you and your dependents are still eligible for
benefits and, if so, for
how long.
<P>
<STRONG>Gather All Current Bills</STRONG><BR>
Many installment loans, service contracts, and credit card accounts are covered by
credit life insurance,
which pays off the account balance in the event of the death of a customer. Make a
prompt request for
release to each bank in which the deceased and you held a joint account.  This is
preliminary to your
withdrawing funds from that account.  Property-casualty insurance policies should
be updated to reflect
changes in ownership.
<P>
<STRONG>Contact Organizations</STRONG><BR>
Contact unions, service organizations, or professional organizations the deceased
belonged to in order
to find out whether you are eligible for any benefits.  Many such groups offer life
insurance policies at
group rates.
<P>
<STRONG>Contact Social Security Office</STRONG><BR>
If the deceased was covered under Social Security, you may be eligible for a
lump-sum death benefit.  It
is usually paid to the surviving spouse, but it can be paid to others under certain
circumstances.
<P>
<STRONG>Meet Advisors</STRONG><BR>
Now is the time to secure the services of professional financial advisors who will
make sure that your
records are in order and see to it that your wishes are met.  The best time to make
contact with a lawyer
is now.  That's because the best time to prepare a will is now. Your insurance
agent can help in settling
your insurance claims, including planning for future monthly income needs, as well as
education, business, and
retirement funding.  Also, he or she can assist you (along with your attorney) with your
estate planning,

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Whole Life</STRONG></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Feature-Rich, Customizable Permanent Life Insurance</STRONG></FONT><P>


We all have different financial needs and objectives.  But life insurance plays a fundamental
role in
most of our plans for financial security.  That's because of the variety of life insurance plans
available
and the many ways they can be customized to meet unique needs at different periods of
your life.<P>

Whole Life insurance from New York Life is just such a feature-rich and customizable
insurance plan. 
It
provides an income tax-free death benefit that can protect the financial security of your
family in the
event of an untimely death.  It offers tax-deferred cash values that, as they accumulate, can
be used to
help purchase a home, help pay for a child's education, or supplement retirement income. 
Of course,
you can also allow cash values to grow to help meet an unexpected emergency or seize an
unanticipated opportunity.<P>
But what's most important about Whole Life insurance is its versatility.  Like an umbrella, it
can help
buffer you and your family from life's storms.  But unlike an umbrella, Whole Life can expand
to provide
greater protection and cash value as your needs increase.  Various policy options allow you
to
purchase additional coverage over and above what the premium buys, thus simultaneously
building
cash value and death benefit; boost your coverage with term insurance; convert that term
insurance at a
later date into permanent Whole Life insurance; add family members to your policy; or even
guarantee
that premiums will continue to be paid should you become disabled.
<P>
<STRONG>Insurance for Your Whole Life</STRONG><BR>
Whole Life is permanent life insurance.  As long as premiums are paid on a timely basis,
your policy
can never be cancelled.  It's life insurance you'll always have. Once set, New York Life
guarantees that
your premiums will never increase.
<P>
<STRONG>Your Policy's Guaranteed Cash Values Build Over Time</STRONG><BR>
The value that builds in your Whole Life policy is called cash value.  Over the long term,
cash
value
accumulation may be considerable, especially since taxes on the money's growth are
deferred.
<P>
<STRONG>Your Policy May Also Earn Dividends</STRONG><BR>
In addition to guaranteed cash values, Whole Life insurance offers an additional potential
for growth. 
Because Whole Life is participating insurance, your policy is eligible for dividends if and
when they are
declared by the Company.  Each year the Company determines what portion of the profits, if
any, of life
insurance policies must be retained to build surplus and the balance that can be returned to
policyowners. This portion is returned in the form of dividends. Whole Life insurance
dividends are
considered a return of premium and are generally not taxable.  <P>
Dividends are yours to do with as you like.  You can use them to purchase paid-up
additional Whole Life
insurance or supplemental term insurance, repay policy loans, or you can take them in cash.
<P>
<STRONG>Versatility and Variety</STRONG><BR>
Since Whole Life premiums are based largely on age, they are typically lowest when the
insured
persons are youngest.  This makes Whole Life an excellent way to plan for the financial
future of
children and grandchildren.<P>
The versatility of Whole Life also makes it a prime candidate for meeting a variety of
business needs. 
You can use it to protect against the loss of key employees, to fund buy-sell agreements, or
ensure the
continuation of your business into its next generation.<P>
And that's not all.  Whole Life insurance can provide funds to preserve your assets for your
family during
estate settlement.  You can even use Whole Life to create a bequest for a favorite charity! 
Speak to your
New York Life agent today to learn more about the many ways you can use our Whole Life
for your
whole life.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Why Is Time So Important When It Comes To
Saving?</STRONG></FONT><P>


A $1 million nest egg by age 65 - it's a nice thought, but such a nest egg will not happen
magically. 
Accumulating assets for retirement takes time and discipline.
<P>
What are the keys to retirement security?  First, it's important to understand that your
investment
success does not depend solely on your ability to pick the stock of the month, time market
highs and
lows, or discover the next great fund manager.  Most successful retirement funds are built by
making
regular payments over time.  Simply put, the sooner you begin to save for future financial
needs, the
better.
<P>
<STRONG>Can You Afford Not To Save?</STRONG><BR>
Time can be one of your most powerful investment allies.  The following example illustrates
this point. 
Your objective is to accumulate $1 million for retirement by age 65.  If you are 25, you will
need to make
an annual investment of just $3,900, assuming an 8% annual return. That's about $325 per
month. 
However, if you wait until age 45, you will need to save almost $22,000 a year or
approximately $1,800
per month to reach your goal.  This is a hypothetical illustration and is not intended to project
the future
performance of any particular product.
<P>
Although this example is basic, it proves a valuable point: postponing saving until later in the
game will
force you to dramatically increase your saving habits.  This is a difficult task, even for the
most
disciplined investor.
<P>
<STRONG>Where Do You Begin Building A Retirement Portfolio?</STRONG><BR>
Pay yourself first.  If you do not currently participate, the first place to begin accumulating
savings for
retirement is your employer-sponsored qualified retirement plan (401(k),
403(b), etc.), which presents a tremendous opportunity for you to get a jump on retirement. 
Some
employers will match employee contributions on a dollar-for-dollar basis, while others may
contribute a
smaller percentage.  Either way, taking advantage of the current tax deductions and the
ongoing tax
deferred compounding of earnings makes smart investment sense.
<P>
You can also contribute up to $2,000 annually in an IRA.  If you do not currently participate in
your
employer's
qualified retirement plan, your IRA contributions are fully tax deductible.  This deduction will
reduce your
taxable income and your current income tax bill. 
<P>
If you do participate in your employer's qualified retirement plan, your deduction for your
contribution
may be reduced or eliminated, depending on your annual adjusted gross income.  And,
even if your
contributions are not deductible, you should still consider making a yearly contribution
because the
money earned in the account compounds tax-deferred.  Most likely, withdrawal of earnings
will occur in
retirement, when you will probably be in a lower tax bracket.  Of course, withdrawals of
earnings are
taxable and, if you are under age <NOBR>59 1/2</NOBR>, may be subject to a 10% tax
penalty. 
<P>
<STRONG>How Do You Start Funding For Retirement?</STRONG><BR>
Whether it's saving for retirement, your children's education, or a home, dollar cost
averaging can
simplify your planning.  There are no mystical secrets behind dollar cost averaging.  It simply
involves
the systematic paying out of a fixed dollar amount at regular time intervals.  This strategy
attempts to
take the ups and downs of the market and "smooth them out."  And, while this strategy does
not
guarantee a profit in a prolonged declining market, it helps you avoid the pitfalls of trying to
"hit the
market at the right times."  Once you initiate a dollar cost averaging plan, the key to success
is sticking
with it and ignoring market fluctuations.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Why Life Insurance in Your Tax Qualified Plan?</STRONG></FONT><P>


<STRONG>Build Your Savings and Protect Your Family</STRONG><BR>
The most typical retirement plans offer several investment options, including one that,
subject to certain
restrictions, allows employees to purchase life insurance with a  portion of their regular plan
contributions.  Through such a plan, you are able to protect your family should you die, and
build cash
value in your life insurance policy as dividends or interest accumulate over time.  What are
the
advantages of life insurance funded through your retirement plan?  <P>
<STRONG>Affordability</STRONG> - Contributions to your retirement plan are generally
made on a
pre-tax basis. 
So, the life insurance you purchase through a qualified retirement plan costs less than if
purchased
with dollars that have already been taxed.  Buying life insurance through a tax qualified plan
may also
free up dollars that you may now be using to purchase insurance outside of the
plan.<P>

A small portion of the policy premiums paid through the tax
qualified plan are reported as taxable income each year.  When the policy cash values are
subsequently paid out as a taxable distribution, these previously taxed amounts may be
used to reduce this taxable income.

<P>
<STRONG>Convenience</STRONG> - Premiums are automatically paid along with your
regular plan
contributions, so there's no need to worry about writing checks or missing a payment.  And,
if your plan
permits, existing funds may be applied as payment for the life insurance.<P>
<STRONG>Tax Advantages</STRONG> - Once again, the dollars used to pay for the
insurance are
pre-tax.  Also
note that the insurance death benefit (in excess of the policy cash value) is not subject to
income taxes. 
And, if your spouse is your beneficiary, the proceeds are estate tax free.  <P>
<STRONG>Cash Value Accumulation</STRONG> - The policy's cash value accumulates
until
retirement and may
be used to provide additional retirement income or may be taken as a lump sum if the plan
permits. 
<P>
<STRONG>Disability Waiver</STRONG> - Some policies include a disability waiver of
premium option. 
This
guarantees that if you become disabled, and are unable to work, New York Life will
automatically pay
your policy premium until your disability ends.<P>

Please see your policy contract for the specifics
on the Disability Waiver of Premium rider.

<P>
<STRONG>Protection Now and at Retirement</STRONG> - Your overall retirement plan
gives you
peace of mind
that your retirement years will be financially stable.  The insurance portion of your retirement
plan
protects you and your family now and in the future.
<P>


<STRONG>Life Insurance Makes Perfect Cents</STRONG><BR>
The chart below illustrates the power of including life insurance in your employer-sponsored
retirement
plan.  Jim and Fred both contribute $3,600 to their plans.  But, Fred uses part of his
contribution to
purchase a $100,000 life insurance policy.  If both Jim and Fred die on day one of the first
year of their
plan participation, Jim's beneficiary receives $3,600 - his plan contribution.  Fred's
beneficiary
receives $2,303 ($3,600 less the policy premium) plus the face amount of the life insurance
policy for a
total of $102,303.  <P>


<P>
Now what if Jim and Fred die after 15 years?  Jim's beneficiary would receive $76,197,
representing his
contribution to the plan plus interest (hypothetical assumed interest rate:  6%).  Fred's
beneficiary would
receive $172,159.  That's $53,605 in plan accumulations plus $118,554 from the
insurance
policy.  In
the example without life insurance, the entire amount paid to the beneficiary is subject to
income tax. 
However, in the example that includes life insurance, the cash value ($22,592) is taxable
(less the
applicable amount of reported term costs).  The remainder of the proceeds ($95,962) is free
from
income tax.  It's clear that life insurance makes a tremendous difference.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Six Retirement Myths</STRONG></FONT><P>

	Like many people, you may have thought about retirement planning without
actually doing as much as you'd like
to
do - at least not yet.  Even if you have been preparing financially and have
amassed what you think is an adequate
retirement income, think again.  Often, people will base their retirement estimates
on several mistaken, but
commonly-held, assumptions regarding retirement and various resources.  In many
cases, the reality of retirement
turns out to be quite different from what these common "retirement myths" would
lead one to believe.
<P>
<STRONG>Myth 1:  I'll Have Social Security to Support Me</STRONG><BR>
	Social Security was never designed to cover income needs, but rather to
supplement your pension and personal
savings.  Here's an idea of what you can expect from Social Security:  if your
annual earnings are $25,000, $40,000,
or $60,000 in 1996, Social Security can provide 50%, 27%, or 23% of your annual income,
respectively.<P>
	At least, that's what you can expect if you retire now.  However, some experts
have estimated that by the time
today's
working baby boomers are ready to retire next century, there may not be enough
people left in the work force to fund
Social Security benefits.  That's all the more reason to look into building up your
retirement savings.
<P>
<STRONG>Myth 2: My Living Costs Will be Lower When I Retire, so I'll Need Less
Money</STRONG><BR>
	Many times, just the opposite is true.  The only costs that may end are
mortgage payments and the college tuition
you may now be paying.  Health care costs could rise, especially if you no longer
have employer-sponsored
medical/dental coverage.  Also, if, like many retirees, you'll eat out frequently,
you could increase your food bills.  And
you'll probably want to pursue your favorite hobbies, recreational activities, and
"dream" vacations.
<P>
<STRONG>Myth 3: I'll Have My Company Pension to Tide Me Over</STRONG><BR>
	Don't count on a pension as your main source of income.  Most defined benefit
plans are geared toward
providing a
replacement ratio of between 40% - 60% of your final average salary.  This amount
generally will be paid only if the
employee has twenty-five or more years of service with the employer.  Also, defined
benefit pensions are often
reduced for payments to Social Security.  Under typical circumstances, the actual
replacement ratio can drop to
between twenty and thirty percent of the final average salary for a rank and file
employee.<P>
	Naturally, each situation is different.  But many retirees have made the
mistake of counting on their pension, only
to
have to find part-time jobs to pay the bills.  With the right planning, this won't
happen to you.

<STRONG>Myth 4:  I'm Too Old to Begin Planning for Retirement Now</STRONG><BR>
	Maybe you can't make up for lost time and opportunity, but it's never too late
to start saving.  Someone who takes
early retirement at age fifty-five may still be going strong for the next thirty
years.  While you'll have to contribute
more to your retirement savings account than if you had started earlier, you can
still be ready for your retirement  if you
start now, and do what needs to be done.
<P>
<STRONG>Myth 5:  The Equity in My Home is My Retirement Fund</STRONG><BR>
	While a house may be your largest investment, residential real estate does not
always appreciate.  Even when
home prices do rise, they usually increase along with all other living expenses. 
Even if you sell and move to a
smaller home, after paying capital gains taxes, you may wind up with far less money
than you expected.  And, when
all your savings have been depleted, you can't sell your house, piece by piece, in
order to eat.  That's why it's
important to have liquid assets that will be there when you need them.
<P>
<STRONG>Myth 6:  My Main Goal Should be to Preserve My Savings</STRONG><BR>
	Inflation is a money-killer, and it will deplete your principal.  To stay ahead
of inflation, you shouldn't seek to
preserve money, but to build on it.  Did you know that a retirement income of
$20,000 in 1970 would have to increase
to $67,000 in 1990 to have the same purchasing power?  A solid financial plan
allows your assets to grow, so that you
can keep up with the rising cost of living.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Your Spouse And Your Pension</STRONG></FONT><P>
 
You face a tough dilemma if you're in line for a pension at retirement. It could
cost you and your spouse
thousands of dollars and take a big chunk out of your children's inheritance.
<P>
It's called the "pension dilemma," because you may end up making a trade-off on
your pension -
deciding whether to take your full pension benefit and expose your spouse to a loss
of benefits at your
death, or taking less than your maximum benefit in exchange for continuing benefits
for your spouse. 
Fortunately, for many couples, there is a win-win third choice.  It's known as
pension maximization. But
first, the pension dilemma:  As an example, let's say you'll be eligible for a
$1,000 monthly pension
benefit at retirement.  That's the value of your benefit and the amount you will
receive under the "single
life option."  The only problem is that your benefits will be paid only as long as
you live.  At your death,
your pension benefits die with you.  That's fine if you're single, but not if
you're married.  Should you die
first, your spouse not only loses you, but also $12,000 a year in income.<P>
That's why, if you're like most people, you will select a "joint and survivor
option," which pays benefits as
long as either of you is alive.  Since your spouse has a legal claim to your
benefits, this is the option
automatically offered by law to married retirees.  Before you can elect another
option, you must both
agree in writing.<P>
However, the cost can be high.  Though the actual number depends on a number of
factors, a typical
$1,000 monthly benefit could be reduced significantly.  For the sake of
discussion,
if a "joint and full
survivor option" is selected, that "single life option" benefit of $1,000 could be
reduced by as much as
$250.  That adds up to $3,000 a year - $30,000 over a ten-year period - in lost
benefits. (See the
chart "Potential Benefit Loss Over 20 Years" below.)
<P>
<STRONG>Pension Maximization Option</STRONG><BR>
Then there is that third option - pension maximization.  The concept is fairly
simple.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Purchase a sufficient amount of life insurance on yourself prior to retirement,
naming your spouse
as beneficiary.  The death benefit is informally earmarked to replace the lost
pension benefit if you die
first.
<LI>At retirement, you and your spouse opt to take the single-life benefit option -
receiving your
maximum pension benefit for as long as you live.
<LI>Use a portion of the additional pension funds - the difference between the
amount for a single
versus a joint and survivor benefit - to pay the life insurance premiums.
</OL>
<P>
Life insurance rates are based primarily on age.  So, the younger you are when you
make this decision,
the lower your rates will be.  But pension maximization may also work even if you
are at or near
retirement.  The idea is to use a portion of your full pension benefit to pay the
insurance premium.  The
result can be a win-win situation for you, your spouse, and your heirs.  Here's
why:
<P>
<OL>

<LI>You receive the maximum pension benefits to which you are entitled.
<LI>Your spouse shares in your benefits.  Should you die first, even though your
pension stops, your
spouse's income continues in the form of insurance proceeds.  In fact, if you like,
these insurance
proceeds can be set up as an annuity - with income benefits guaranteed for life.
<LI>Should your spouse die first, your benefits will continue.  The life insurance
can be cashed in or the
beneficiary changed.
<LI>Cash values accumulate in your life insurance policy.  If you and your partner
live well into your
golden years, the insurance can protect other assets for your heirs.  In fact, no
matter what happens,
your estate can be protected, enabling you to pass assets on to your children,
grandchildren, or a
favorite charity.
</OL>
<P>
<EM>Is pension maximization right for you?</EM>  That depends.  There are many
factors that need to
be taken into
consideration,  including both your ages, health status, actual pension benefit,
and costs.  Still, you owe
it to yourself and your spouse to find out more.
<P>
<EM>Recommendation: </EM> Check with your pension plan administrator and find out
about your
projected
benefits under the straight life option.  Then ask what the decreased amount will
be each month to add
your spouse under a survivorship option.  Next, contact your New York Life agent to
discuss whether or
not pension maximization is a cost-effective choice you need to consider.  There's
no cost or obligation.

<STRONG>A Sampling of Benefit Options</STRONG>
<P>
<EM>Single Life Option:</EM>  Benefits continue for as long as the benefit
recipient lives, whether the
recipient lives
to age 66 or 106.  This option pays the maximum monthly benefit amount.
<P>
<EM>Joint and Full Survivor Option:</EM>  The same amount of benefit is paid for as
long as either
recipient is
alive.  However, that benefit amount will usually be lower than under the single
life option.  (Example:  A
single life benefit of $1,000 a month may be reduced to $750 a month under the
joint and full survivor
option.)
<P>
<EM>Joint and Reduced Survivor Option: </EM> Initial benefits are higher than under
the joint and full
survivor
option, but then continue after the death of one person at a reduced level,
generally 50 percent. 
(Example:  Joint benefit may be $850, continued at $425 a month to the survivor.)

<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>The Role of Employee Benefits in
Today's
Economy</STRONG></FONT><P>

	The competition for top quality employees can be
expected
to
stiffen.  Those
same people on your payroll who were grateful to have a job
at all last year could
start
receiving
attractive offers from competitors.  At the same time, if
you're ready to make that
long-delayed
expansion, don't expect new personnel to come cheap.  Base
pay will be a factor. 
But many
employees
are looking for more than cash these days.
<P>
	Your company's benefits will play a bigger role in
attracting and retaining the
right
people to help
your
business grow and prosper.  This means now is a good time -
in fact, a crucial time
- to
rethink your
company's benefits strategy.
<P>
	Keep in mind that a competitive benefits package doesn't
have to cost your
company
an arm and a
leg.  In fact, it is possible to select and then customize
benefits for maximum
advantage to
you and your
company while making sure that  your employees are happy,
too.  The key is to
pick and
choose your
benefits carefully.
<P>

<STRONG>The Benefits of Benefits</STRONG><BR>
	Begin by rethinking your current attitude toward
employee benefits.  To many
small
business
owners,
fringe benefits are perceived as a no-value expense that
eats up the
bottom
line and
provides little in return.  In reality, your company's
employee benefits should
accomplish
three valuable
objectives.
<P>

<OL>
<LI>They should enhance profitability, not cut into it.  The
benefits you provide
should
not be
thought of as
just another expense.  Though indirectly so, they may also lead
to enhanced
profitability -
through reduced
turnover and training expenses, etc.

<LI>They should represent a genuine value to your employees. 
The key is
perception. 
Within your
company, it is important to identify high-profile benefits
that employees will
notice and
appreciate.  This
can often be accomplished by  providing specific benefits to
valued
employees.  

<LI>Ideally, they should also directly benefit you and other
owners.  If you're an
owner-employee, you
may qualify to participate in your company's qualified
benefit plans.  The result
could be tax
and other
savings.  
</OL>

<P>
	In short, you must weigh cost and value when it comes
to
providing the
best-choice benefits within your company.  Let's take a look
at some of those
options and
what they
have to offer you and your employees.
<P>

<STRONG>Standard Benefits Options</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>Health Insurance:</STRONG>  With medical costs
continuing to rise, health
insurance is
the most valued and sought-after benefit today.  The problem
is that health
insurance can be
expensive, but only if you provide comprehensive coverage
and pick up the whole
tab.  
<P>
	There are a number of cost-cutting options available. 
For instance, your plan
can be set
up on a
contributory, cost sharing basis, whereby you and your
employees split the cost of
coverage. 
There are
also such premium-saving options as higher deductibles and
benefit limits.
<P>
<STRONG>Life Insurance:</STRONG>  Here, too, options abound. 
Group term coverage,
for
example,
can be surprisingly inexpensive to provide to your
employees.  Many plans tie
benefits to
income.  And
as with health coverage, when properly arranged, your costs
will generally be
deductible as
a business
expense.
<P>
<STRONG>Disability Insurance:</STRONG>  The importance of
such coverage is often
overlooked,
even though the danger of disability is real.  For instance,
according to
statistics compiled for
use by the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners, one in
three people between the
ages of
thirty-five
and sixty-five will suffer a disability that lasts six
months or longer. 
Disability coverage
insures an
employee's income earning ability.  It is designed to
replace income if a person
becomes
disabled and
is unable to work.
<P>
<STRONG>Deferred Compensation:</STRONG>  This executive perk
comes in a number of
variations. 
However, under a basic deferred compensation plan, the
employee agrees to either a
reduction in
current salary or a deferral of a planned raise.  In return,
the business commits
to a series of
payments
to the employee at retirement, with the amount, frequency
and duration of payments
determined when
the agreement is negotiated.
<P>  
	Such a plan can help reduce taxes for highly compensated
employees and
supplement their
retirement income.  For the business, it locks in a valued
employee with "golden
handcuffs,"
since the
employee can have no claim to the deferred amounts until
retirement.  This also
protects the
employee,
who generally pays no tax on the funds until they are
actually received. 
<P>
<STRONG>	Qualified Retirement Plans: </STRONG> Especially
if your work force is
older, a qualified
retirement plan may be an attractive benefit.  Options
include defined benefit
plans, defined
contribution
plans, 401(k) plans, Simplified Employee Pensions and more.
<P>
<STRONG>Where to Begin</STRONG><BR>
	That's an overview of some of the most popular choices
when designing the right
benefit package
for
your business.
<P>
	Start the decision process by weighing your objectives
and needs.  Analyze the
pros
and cons of
the
various options available to you.  Keep in mind that your
decision must factor in
tax and
other considerations.
<P>
	Fortunately, you don't have to go it alone.  Your New
York Life representative
can work
with you to
review your situation, analyze your needs and help you
design a benefits package
for your
company
that
reflects your unique situation and, most of all, can help
meet your needs and
objectives.<P>

<BR>

As we move into the second half of the decade, changing American

demographics make it clear

that a "one size fits all" approach to health benefits planning

is no longer workable.<P>



More and more organizations are offering a series of different

plans to fit the needs and

lifestyles of the many different segments of their employee

population.  But, to be

effective, benefits managers must examine how changing attitudes

toward life and work

situations have caused employees and prospective recruits to

think differently about

themselves and their futures.<P>



To gain insight into these issues, NYLCare recently examined some

of the most significant

demographic trends that have emerged in recent years, and

informally surveyed some insurance

professionals on how they are helping benefits managers cope with

this fast-changing

environment.  We discovered three trends in particular that will

have a profound impact on

the workplace of tomorrow: <A HREF="emdmfm.html">the changing family unit</A>, 

<A HREF="emdmed.html">a better educated workforce</A>, and <A HREF="emdmww.html">an increase in the number of working women</A>.</STRONG>

<P><BR><BR>

The health care benefit dilemma of the 1990s:  At the very time employers are being squeezed on all sides to reduce costs, there's a growing demand on the part of employees to maintain - in fact, increase - their health care options.<P>

Health care benefits can be expensive.  On average, medical costs have risen at nearly twice the rate of inflation in recent years.  In response, some businesses have reduced benefits or gone to more restrictive plans. The risk is that this can hurt morale and in turn negatively impact productivity.<P>

The real question:  How can you control your company's health care costs without sacrificing plan benefits and flexibility?<P>

The real answer:  A NYLCare managed health care plan that can "blend" the features of an HMO or other managed care plans with traditional health insurance.  The result can be a cost effective package, which combines the advantages of both types of coverages.<P>

What does a managed care plan look like?  That depends totally and completely on your company's needs.  NYLCare, which works with more than 16,000 employer groups nationwide, offers a full spectrum of health plan designs:<P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
			<LI>Managed Indemnity
			<LI>Preferred Provider Organization (PPO)
			<LI>Multi-Option
			<LI>Point-of-Service (POS)
			<LI>HMO
</UL>

Definitions of these different health care arrangements can be found in the <A HREF="mcgl.html">Health Care Terms Glossary</A>. <P>

The options are nearly unlimited.  Under a multi-option plan, for example, a variety of different plans can be combined, such as a PPO plan and an HMO or an HMO with a POS plan. <P>

The advantages of adopting a managed care plan through NYLCare include:<P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Built-in plan design flexibility: The plan you implement will be designed and tailored to reflect the unique benefit needs of your business. You can also select the type of plan and amount of benefits your employees will receive. <P>

	<LI>Cost controls and predictability: A plan will be designed that is affordable and, just as important, enables you to budget and manage your health care costs.<P>

	<LI>NYLCare will work with your business to help keep your health care costs predictable and, therefore, manageable.  With a managed care option from NYLCare, for instance, you can select the option that is best suited to your budget. <P>

	<LI>Options for enhanced benefits.  Key employees can often afford to purchase higher benefits for themselves and their families.  Many business owners find that obtaining quality, affordable health care benefits for themselves and their families can be difficult.  However, a NYLCare managed care plan can help meet your family's individual health care needs and it can do so on a tax-deductible basis.<P>

	<LI>Options for employee choice, which can have a positive affect on labor relations.
</UL>

<STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1">Making an Informed Health Care Decision</FONT></STRONG>

<P>
If you are an employee of a business offering a group health plan, you may have several
options.<P>

At first glance, your choices may read like alphabet soup.  Should you select an HMO or a
PPO? Or is a
POS plan best for you?<P>

The best-choice plan will address your individual health care needs and situation, and can
possibly
save you money.<P>

As an informed consumer, the first step is to make sense of the "alphabet soup". <P>

Here are the most common options:
<P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI><STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1">HMO: A Health Maintenance Organization</FONT></STRONG><P>

A Health Maintenance Organization delivers routine and
medically necessary care through plan-affiliated physicians and hospitals.  That care is
often provided
or coordinated by a primary care physician.  If you use non-affiliated providers, benefits
may not be paid without prior approval.  
<P>

An HMO may be best for you if. . .<P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
		<LI>you need to keep your out-of-pocket expenses to a minimum.
		<LI>you want the option of unlimited doctor visits at little additional costs.
		<LI>you like the convenience of no claims forms.
</UL>

<P>
<LI><STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1">Indemnity Plans</FONT></STRONG>
<P>

These are traditional fee-for-service plans.  After
a
stipulated deductible, all or a portion (coinsurance) of covered services are paid by the
plan.  These plans give you complete control over provider selection.  However, your
out-of-pocket expenses can be high.<P>

An indemnity plan may be best for you if. . .<P>

<UL TYPE=disc>
		<LI>you are financially able to cover out-of-pocket costs.
		<LI>you want complete control over your choice of physician and other providers.

</UL>
<P>

<LI><STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1">POS: Point-of-Service Plans</FONT></STRONG><P>
 

Point-of-Service Plans combine features of an HMO and a
traditional
indemnity plan.  To obtain higher in-network benefits, you use the provider services
exactly
like an HMO member.  If you do not follow HMO procedures, your benefits resemble those of
an
indemnity plan, with deductibles and co-payments.<P>

	A POS may be best for you if. . .<P>
<UL TYPE=disc>
		<LI>you like all the benefits of an HMO for yourself for most services.
		<LI>you have a family member away from home, in college, perhaps, who is best
served with an indemnity option.
		<LI>you require unrestricted freedom to select a provider when 	necessary without
the
need for prior approval.
		<LI>you are willing to accept additional out-of-pocket costs.

</UL>
<P>

<LI><STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1">PPO: Preferred Provider Organizations</FONT></STRONG><P>

Preferred Provider Organizations list "preferred" doctors and
hospitals that plan members are encouraged to use. The plan then reimburses a percentage of
the cost (such as 90%).  If you elect to use other providers, reimbursement is typically
less
(such as 70%). 
<P>

	A PPO may be best for you if. . .<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
		<LI>you are comfortable with the preferred providers available through the plan for
most services.
		<LI>you require the flexibility to go outside the plan when necessary without the
need for prior approval.
</UL>
<P>
</UL>



<STRONG>Which option is best for you?</STRONG><BR>
That is a personal decision. It will depend on your age, specific health needs, your family
status and your financial responsibilities.<P>

<STRONG>The NYLCare Advantage:</STRONG><BR>
Whichever NYLCARE plan you select, you can know that you will receive a quality benefit,
backed by New York Life, one of the oldest and most respected insurers in the United
States. 
For more information, speak to your employer regarding the benefits available to you.<P>

<STRONG><A NAME="hmo">Health Maintenance
Organization (HMO)</A></STRONG><BR>
A type of plan that controls health care expenses by making
cost-saving arrangements with
physicians, hospitals and other health care providers.  HMOs
usually offer reduced
out-of-pocket costs to members who have their care provided or
coordinated by a
primary care
physician participating in the HMO network.<P>


<STRONG><A NAME="mi">Managed Indemnity</A></STRONG><BR>
A plan in which the covered person has the flexibility to obtain
care from any licensed provider
but
must pay a greater portion of health care costs than with a
network-based plan.  Utilization
review and case management programs apply managed care principals
to indemnity plans
to help
control costs.<P>

<STRONG><A NAME="pos">Point-of-Service (POS)</A> </STRONG><BR>
A plan that offers greater flexibility than an HMO-only product. 
The POS allows members to
select one of two options each time  care is needed: either the
HMO plan as described
in this glossary,
or a traditional indemnity plan which enables the covered person
to choose any non-network licensed
physician or hospital for care.  However, this requires higher
out-of-pocket costs than
network care.<P>

<STRONG><A NAME="poe">Multi-Option (also known as
Point-of-Enrollment or POE)</A></STRONG><BR>
Similar to a POS plan in that there is a choice of two, and
sometimes more, different
options.  However, a multi-option plan is less flexible than a
POS plan because the
member
must select his/her option at the time of enrollment and is
typically locked-in to that
choice for a year.<P>



<STRONG><A NAME="ppo">Preferred Provider
Organization (PPO)</A></STRONG><BR>
Similar to an HMO plan in that reduced costs are available to
members who use providers
that
participate in the PPO network.  The typical difference is that
the
member may self-refer to a
preferred provider and does not need to have any care coordinated
by a primary care
physician.<P>


<STRONG><A NAME="pcp">Primary Care Physician (PCP)
</A></STRONG><BR>

A Primary Care Physician, or PCP, is a provider who coordinates a
member's covered health care in an HMO.  In many ways, Primary
Care Physicians (or PCPs) are a return to something that was very
good about medicine in the old days-- a doctor who knows you
well.  <P>

Mutual funds are among the most popular ways to invest - and for good reason. When you invest in a mutual fund, you join other investors, pooling your money to purchase securities and pursue a specific objective. 
<P>
If you don't have the time to follow the markets, the experience to manage a portfolio, or the resources to diversify on your own, mutual funds may offer you four important advantages.
<P>
<STRONG>Diversification</STRONG><BR>
By pooling the resources of many investors, mutual funds are able to purchase a broader range of securities than most individuals can afford on their own. While the types of securities a fund may purchase will depend on its investment objective, diversification is widely recognized as a way that may help reduce investment risk. 
<P>
<STRONG>Flexibility</STRONG><BR>
Mutual fund "families" offer investors the ability to stick with their original investment or move some of their money among various funds when markets shift or their personal circumstances change.
<P>
<STRONG>Professional management</STRONG><BR>
Mutual funds are managed by experienced investment professionals, who continually monitor the economy, the markets, and individual securities to free you from having to make complex day-to-day investment decisions.
<P>
<STRONG>Convenience</STRONG><BR>
Mutual funds are a convenient and affordable way to invest. In many cases, the minimum investment may be less than the cost of a single security in the fund's portfolio. Depending on your needs, you can arrange to have any income or capital gains automatically reinvested or sent directly to you.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Overview</STRONG></FONT><P>

You are not alone if you find certain investment and tax decisions intimidating.
You understand the need
to re-invest the retirement plan money that is yours to take when you leave your
company. However, like
many people, you may be unsure where to start. What you decide will affect your
current and future
income, your tax obligations and your short- and long-term financial security.
<P>
For a century and a half, New York Life and its subsidiaries have provided
investment assistance and
products to people like you. 
<P>
To help you make informed decisions the New York Life Rollover IRA Program offers:
<P>
<UL>

you negotiate the investment, IRA and tax maze step-by-step, and
make informed decisions.

and mutual funds, including the MainStay Family of Funds and
New York Life annuities, all in one convenient account.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A

<STRONG>How should you invest your money?</STRONG><BR>
Whether you are retiring, accepting a job with another company, or leaving
your company for
some
other reason, the money you have "built up" in your company retirement plan
is yours to take.
This lump
sum of money is called a distribution, and may be the single largest sum you
will ever
receive. When
you become eligible to receive a distribution, you must make two very
important decisions
about how to
handle it for your long-term best interest:
<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>How should you take your money from your employer?
	<LI>What should you do with it then?
</UL>
<P>
This section explains and explores the second question and the factors you
should consider
when planning your financial future.

<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Annuity - Your Guaranteed Income Option</STRONG></FONT><P>

An annuity is an investment that can provide you with a fixed monthly income
for the remainder of your
life. Some types of annuities can also continue the monthly payments for a
spouse or another
beneficiary.
<P>
An annuity is generally purchased by a lump sum premium that you pay once,
before the annuity takes
effect. This premium entitles you to the income that you'll receive in the future.
Once your annuity has
been purchased, the fixed payments will not change. The monthly payments are
guaranteed, and the
amount is based on the size of the premium, options and life expectancy.
<P>
Annuities are sold mainly by insurance companies and are either "immediate"
or "deferred." An
"immediate annuity" begins paying monthly benefits shortly after the premium is
received by the
insurance company. A "deferred annuity" starts paying benefits later, often many
years after you pay
your premium.

Disability insurance products enhance an employer's benefits package by providing
employees with
financial security in the event of a serious illness or injury.  NYLCare's Disability products
include Long
Term Disability and Short Term Disability, which are designed to partially replace the earnings of employees who are absent from work because of a disability.

<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Simplified Employee Pension Plans
(SEP)</STRONG></FONT><P>


<STRONG>An Ideal Plan For Small And Medium Sized
Businesses</STRONG><BR>
A SEP is a simplified retirement plan, which allows employers to
make contributions
directly to their
employees' own Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs).  Employers
receive a tax
deduction for the full
amount of each contribution.
<P>
Because of its simplicity, the SEP is an excellent low-cost
alternative to a
pension or profit sharing plan,
allowing small and medium-sized businesses to control the cost of
providing a
retirement plan.
<P>
The IRS provides an approved document and there is no expensive,
time consuming
annual reporting
to either the IRS or the Department of Labor.  But what are the
specific benefits
to you?
<P>

<STRONG>Your Benefits With A SEP</STRONG><BR>
All contributions you make to your employees' SEP, up to the
lesser of 15% of each
employee's
compensation or $30,000<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A
HREF="#1">1</A></FONT></SUP>, are
tax
deductible business expenses.
<P>
As an employee of your company, you are also entitled to set up a
SEP for your
benefit.
<P>
Each year, you determine the amount, if any, to be contributed to
the plan for that
year.
<P>
All earnings in a SEP accumulate tax-deferred and provide retirement
income in addition
to Social Security
benefits.
<P>
A SEP is an excellent incentive for attracting qualified
employees, reducing
turnover, and retaining
those
with proven ability and experience.
<P>
A SEP is easy to establish and understand, with minimal
recordkeeping and
government reporting.
<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A
NAME="1"><STRONG>1</STRONG></A></FONT></SUP> Only the first
$150,000 of compensation is considered, limiting the maximum
contribution to $22,500.</FONT>
<P>
<BR>



<STRONG>The SEP Advantage - Reduced Corporate Taxes</STRONG><BR>
A SEP can help you save money on your corporate taxes. Saving
money on corporate
taxes can directly
improve your bottom line, as the following chart shows:

<P>

As you can see, with the $17,000 tax savings, a $50,000 SEP
contribution actually
costs only $33,000.
<P>
<STRONG>Fund Your SEP  With Mutual Funds</STRONG><BR>
Mutual funds can be excellent investments for your SEP. Many
mutual fund families
offer a wide
range of investment opportunities, designed to meet the financial
goals of
virtually every type of investor.
<P>
Since a SEP allows employees to select their investments, the
well-defined
investment objectives
and flexibility of mutual funds make them an ideal investment
option for a SEP. 
Moreover, mutual funds
are
professionally managed and provide you with diversified
investments.

<P>
To meet the needs of our members from coast to coast, NYLCare is divided into eleven regional organizations.  Each regional
organization has a full range of product delivery and service capabilities to respond to local market conditions.  A national
structure - with a local focus - ensures the highest level of service possible.<P>

NYLCare is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the New York Life Insurance Company.  The NYLCare name reflects the important
relationship that exists between NYLCare and New York Life.

<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Site Navigation Tips</STRONG></FONT><P>

We have incorporated several features that make it easy for you to navigate your way around this site.<P>  

<STRONG>Relative Location Within the Site</STRONG><BR>
Most pages in this site have headers and, in some cases, subheaders, as in the example below.  A subheader will be located directly beneath the header (this page has no subheader).  The header and subheader indicate your relative location in the site.<P>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="/nylcare/images/inntim.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="397" HEIGHT="98" BORDER="0"><P>
</CENTER>

<STRONG>Returning to the Top of a Section or Subsection</STRONG><BR>
If the headers or subheader is bright blue, as in the example above, it is an active "hyperlink".

If you click on a blue header title, the top level page for that section will be displayed.

If you click on a smaller blue subheader title, the top level page for that particular subsection will be displayed.<P>



<STRONG>Navigating Within a Section or Subsection</STRONG><BR>
At the bottom of most pages within a section, you will also see lateral links to other pages within that section. <P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>The page you are on will be displayed in bold type, but will not be active.  For example, at the bottom of this page, you can see that you are on the "Site Navigation Tips" page.  <BR>

	<LI>Any other pages listed are active links. For example, you can click on the "Welcome to the NYLCare Web Site!" link below to connect to that page.  Try it now!
