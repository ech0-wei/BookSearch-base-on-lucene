Group Says Agriculture Helped by RFG Increases

A correlation between increased ethanol usage and the reformulated 
gasoline (RFG) program is clearly shown in the most recent gasoline
utilization numbers made available by the U.S. Department of 
Transportation.

States where RFG rules have been in effect show that the market 
percentage for ethanol blends has increased compared to the same
period in 1994, said Gary Goldberg, American Corn Growers 
Association president.

In traditional farm states, demand for ethanol has dropped, but it
has increased in midwestern states that are part of the RFG program.
While usage has dropped in Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, 
Ohio and a whopping 46 percent in Oklahoma, it has increased by even 
larger amounts in Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Nationally, RFG use is credited for a nine percent increase in
ethanol demand.  Said Goldberg, "To those in the ethanol industry
that have tried to downplay the importance of the Reformulated 
Gasoline program, these numbers speak for themselves...[and] clearly 
show that increased demand for ethanol and increased market 
penetration is driven by access to the RFG program."

Earlier in the year, the Energy Information Agency predicted that
yearly ethanol demand will increase from 1.6 billion gallons today
to 3.03 billion gallons by the year 2010.  The increase could mean a 
700 million bushel increase in yearly corn use.  But the increase 
will only occur if RFG programs remain in place, ACGA predicts.

Goldberg said different ways are suggested to expand ethanol's role,
but it is clear that "the RFG program is the most logical and
cost-effective means to grow the market."

Higher Speeds May Increase Smog Potential in CA

With increased speed limits in California -- from 55 mph to 65 mph 
-- the California Air Resources Board (CARB) is predicting that 
increased tailpipe emissions will cause the amount of ozone forming 
pollutants in the air to rise from one percent to three percent 
almost immediately.

But stronger regulations appear unlikely, since "We already have the 
nation's most effective motor- vehicle control," according to Jerry 
Martin, air board spokesman.  He agreed new regulations were 
possible, but were not being planned at the moment.

Worst hit would be the Los Angeles basin, which ironically had just
celebrated the cleanest air in more than two decades.  Two key
pollutants -- volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides 
-- are expected to create the increase in ground level ozone.

The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) said it
expects that between 12 and 18 tons of VOCs will be addded daily to
the 588 tons projected for 1996, and that nitrogen oxides would add 
14 tons daily to the projected 466 tons.

In the state capital, Sacramento, itself a bastion of bad air,
discussions are under way on whether the state will drop its
requirement that all cars sold in the state in 1998 be 
zero-emissions (electric) vehicles.  Another 14 tons could be added 
to pollutants if the requirement is dropped, the Coalition for Clean 
Air lamented.

All of the estimates, however, are based on the premise that all
drivers will ratchet up the speed they drive.  The California 
Highway Patrol (CHP) reports that since the new limits went into 
effect people continue to drive much as they had before -- at around 
70 mph.  A "creep" may manifest itself in time, CHP concedes.

Europe Reduces Duty on Imported Methanol

A recent European Union (EU) announcement said the first million 
metric tons of methanol to come through customs in EU countries will
only require duty of less than half the normal amount.

Not much impact is expected on the amount of methanol imported, nor 
on exporting countries, industry analysts say.

Users of methanol in the industrial sector wanted a duty-free quota
for methanol, as was permitted last year, but the EU chose instead
to cut the tariff to four percent rather than 8.1 percent on the 
first million metric tons.

Judith Speed, international methanol manager for ICI Industrial
Products, Inc., a European methanol producer, said that "Duty-free
and reduced duty quotas were designed to work in specific, abnormal 
situations."  She added that "If quotas are continually allowed, 
they set a precedent and then you may as well have them all of the 
time."

Speed said that last year's quota was regarded by European methanol
producers as "quite reasonable," but noted that by the time the
quota went into effect, prices had begun to drop and "there really 
wasn't any need for the duty-free shipments."

One methanol producer who ships to Europe said "A four percent
reduction in the European duty is not enough for us to divert our
normal export patterns."

Added Jim Thomas, vice president of market analysis for Houston's
Bonner & Moore Associates, "You can get all the methanol you want in
Europe right now."

Speed says that European producers are not worried about the quota,
but nonetheless the European Methanol Producers Association is
asking for an investigation into the quota on principle because 
"There is a lot of 'horse-trading' going on between countries, and 
we think that should be looked into," said Speed.

Mexico Is Undergoing Environmental Protection Revolution

     The Mexican government, headed by President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari, is starting to seriously address a myriad of severe
environmental problems that 40 years of uncontrolled industrial
development have created.  Salinas' speeches, including his 1
November "State of the Nation" address, sound more like speeches
from "Green" conventions than those of a president of a third
world country, say political analysts.  Until recently the
environment had not been much of worry for Mexicans and their
government -- economic growth, illiteracy, and malnutrition were
the top priorities -- but Mexico's environmental problems --
especially in Mexico City -- are beginning to wake people up, say
observers.  For example, television programs, radio reports, and
banner headlines about the environment are commonplace in Mexico
today.  Mexico's intellectuals are also putting pressure on
government and industry to clean up and protect the environment.
"We have a silent disaster under way that is threatening Mexico's
development," Homero Aridjis, Mexican novelist and president of
the Group of 100, a group of prominent Latin American
intellectuals working to protect the region's environment.
     Mexico's environmental problems include Mexico City's
permanent blanket of brown smog -- the result of five million tons
of pollutants spewed into its air yearly by three million cars and
36,000 factories -- rivers and lakes polluted with untreated human
and industrial waste, rapid deforestation, and the polluted
US-Mexican border area littered with "maquiladoras," or inbound
assembly plants.
     The country's first environmental legislation controlling
emissions was passed in 1988, and the Ecology and Urban
Development Secretariat (SEDUE) showed industry it meant business
by conducting spot checks in April and May.  Two-thirds of the
industries inspected failed, resulting in hundreds of factories
being temporarily shut down and fined.  SEDUE kicked off the
campaign in March by closing a major state-owned oil refinery
operating in Mexico City.  "Industry didn't think it would happen;
they didn't believe we would enforce the law," said SEDUE
spokesman Eduardo Garcia.  The crackdown involved not only
Mexican firms, but also such multinationals as German chemical
giant BASF AG and US-based Dow Chemical Co.  "The law is being
enforced, and it's causing Mexican companies to run around like
chickens looking for help with and information on cleaning up
dirty emissions," said Alfonso Cipres of the Mexican Ecological
Movement.
     The Mexican government is also working closely with US
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) authorities to develop ways
to clean up and protect the Mexico-US border area from further
environmental contamination, which some critics fear is a
possibility if trade and industrial activity are allowed to flow
freely across the border.  President Salinas has acknowledged that
Mexico's border area needs cleaning up, but has steadfastly vowed
not to allow Mexico's environment to deteriorate further and
"become a haven for polluters" when, and if, trade barriers are
removed.  Mexico -- out of necessity -- is undergoing an
environmental protection revolution that promises to radically
change how things are done in Mexico, particularly the way
business is conducted.  In coming issues, EWLA will examine in
detail how environmental protection laws and regulations in Mexico
are affecting industrial operations.

Brazil Awaits Financing to Clean Up Sao Paulo's Polluted Tiete
River

     The state of Sao Paulo is preparing to start a US $1 billion
project to clean up the state's most important -- and polluted --
river, the Tiete, by the year 2005.  On 4 October, Sao Paulo
Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury, accompanied by other Brazilian
officials, discussed the cleanup plan and possible financing
arrangements with the president of the Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) in Washington, DC, USA.  Brazilian officials hope the
IDB will finance about half the cost of the project, or about US
$500 million.  According to IDB officials, the bank is studying
the request and putting it through the normal review process,
which could take up to several years, before any decision is made.
However, one IDB official told EWLA that the bank feels it's a
worthwhile project that should be funded.  The rest of the funds
needed for the project are slated to come from Brazil's federal
government, Sao Paulo's state government, and private groups.
     The Tiete River runs from the Atlantic highlands in eastern
Sao Paulo through the Sao Paulo metropolitan area, where it
becomes highly polluted from 3.5 billion liters of mostly
untreated domestic (two-thirds) and industrial waste (one-third)
dumped into it daily, and then feeds into the river Parana.
Brazilian officials say that only about 16% of the waste
discharged into the river is currently treated.  Discharging
untreated waste in Brazil isn't illegal yet, but government
officials say that is about to change.
     The project's initial goal, according to Fleury, is to cut by
50% to 60% the amount of untreated effluent entering the river by
1994.  The funds are to be spent on constructing water-treatment
plants along the river to treat domestic waste.  The plan will
also require the more than 1,000 industries operating along the
river to clean up their own effluent; many industries plan to work
together and build common water-treatment plants to save money.
When the project is completed in the year 2005, "it will be
possible to fish once again in the river," said the governor.
     Despite Fleury's optimism, it appears the project may already
be heading for problems.  According to the state's constitution,
the first water project in the state of Sao Paulo must be the
cleanup of the Billings Dam area, a seriously polluted reservoir
that provides much of metropolitan Sao Paulo's water.  In
addition, environmentalists have criticized the governor's plan
because they say he will simply use the money to give
antipollution equipment to private industries to clean up their
effluents.

Argentina to Create Environment Secretariat by Early 1992

     Argentina plans to have its first ministerial-level
environment secretariat in place and operating by early 1992.
President Carlos Menem, seeking to be Argentina's "environment
president," recently created the secretariat by presidential
decree because the current constitution allows for only eight
ministries, and the environment had never been one of them.  "We
are in the process of amending the constitution to allow for a
secretariat of the environment at the highest level," said Alberto
Barbuto, president of the National Commission for Environmental
Policy.  The presidential decree allowed the Menem government to
legally circumvent the constitution until it's changed;
administration officials are working with legislators in both
houses of Congress and expect routine passage of the proposed
constitutional amendment when it is brought before Congress.
     The new secretariat, which will employ approximately 200
people, will be in charge of national environmental policy, help
Congress write modern environmental laws, and ensure that the new
laws are enforced, Barbuto told EWLA.  The secretariat will work
with the country's 23 provincial environment ministries on
environmental matters of overlapping jurisdiction.  Committees are
now writing coordinated environmental laws that will carry
penalties for offenders.  "Today, for example, there is no penal
code in Argentina for contaminating water, only for deliberately
poisoning it," said Barbuto.  A general environmental law will
outline basics, such as a requirement that all construction
projects conduct environmental impact studies.  More specific laws
will protect natural resources and establish toxic waste penal
codes.
     Critics charge, however, that in reality the Argentine
government has no real environment policy and is simply trying to
improve its "green" image by creating another government agency.
"If this government really wanted to come up with a national
environmental policy, it would be consulting with nongovernmental
organizations and industry, and would not be picking Maria Julia
Alsogaray, a person with no environmental protection background,
to head up the new secretariat," said Patricia Gay, executive
director of Friends of the Earth Argentina.  Environmentalists say
that instead of creating more agencies, the government should
concentrate on enforcing environmental laws and regulations, which
are now being "totally ignored by industry in Argentina."  Pedro
Tarak of the Foundation for Natural Resources and the Environment
doubts this new secretariat will ever write any environmental laws
 -- or enforce them -- because the existing agency, he said,
doesn't write laws or enforce them now.
     "The private sector in Argentina is starting to take
environmental protection more seriously, although the topic isn't
as intense here as it is in other parts of the world," said
industrialist Federico Zorraquin, president of Grupo Zorraquin, a
group of large industrial companies.  According to Jorge Rivara of
DuPont Argentina, there is indeed a group of industries --
especially chemical and petrochemical -- that are starting to
worry about the changes to come.  "However, they are waiting to
see how this new environment secretariat will operate and, above
all, how much power it will have," he told EWLA.  Zorraquin is
also a member of the Business Council for Sustainable
Development, an international group of business leaders
coordinating industry's contribution to the United Nations
Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in
1992.  He said the reason environmental protection isn't very high
on the business agenda in Argentina is because "Argentina's
environmental problems aren't very visible."  For example,
environmental degradation in Buenos Aires is mainly a problem in
the poorer sections of the city and doesn't directly effect the
majority of the population, according to Zorraquin.  Nevertheless,
he does believe that the government needs to strengthen its
ability to enforce environmental regulations.

Argentine Leather Processor Threatens Public Health

     The Argentine leather processing factory Inducuer, located in
the city of Florencio Varela (30 km southeast of Buenos Aires), is
threatening the local population's health as it continues to
allegedly discharge chromium illegally into nearby streams and
land.  (Chromium is a toxic metallic chemical element.)
     Although Florencio Varela officials have occasionally fined
 -- recently US $25,000 -- and temporarily closed down the plant
several times over the past two decades for local environmental
law violations, they have not closed down the plant permanently
due to economic considerations.  Company sources say privately
that they would prefer to close down permanently, putting 180
people out of work, before investing US $2 million needed to
remove chromium from its wastewater and properly dispose of the
waste material.  The federal government has not been involved with
this case because there is no federal law in Argentina prohibiting
the discharge of chromium, but this may soon change (see previous
story).
     Since the plant opened in 1974, many of the city's 6,000
residents have suffered from skin infections and lung and kidney
problems due to high levels of chromium in the water and air.  In
early October, two newborn infants in a neighborhood close to the
factory died from chromium poisoning.  The neighborhood's drinking
water, recently tested by local water officials, was determined to
be highly contaminated with chromium.  "The water even came of the
spout green, the color of chromium," said one water official.
Carlos Bralo, a lawyer representing the affected community, told
EWLA that new tap water standards are beginning to improve the
quality of water somewhat, but the air continues to be polluted
with chromium.  "We are breathing in chromium," he said as he
pointed to deteriorating metals on houses in the area.  Bralo has
filed a suit against Inducuer on behalf of the families who lost
their children, but observers say it will be years before there is
any justice.

Spanish Bank Funds Santiago Air Pollution Study

     The Banco Santander, a Spanish bank with subsidiaries in
Chile, is currently assembling a team of international
environmental experts who will collaborate with local
environmental officials and scientists at the University of Chile
to study Santiago's severe air pollution problem and come up with
viable solutions.  The bank initiated and is funding the year-long
project, which will cost an estimated US $250,000.
     Bank President Emilio Botin expressed the bank's desire to
organize and fund such a team to work on this problem while
visiting Chilean President Patricio Aylwin on 2 September in
Santiago.  Sources say Aylwin was appreciative and pointed out to
Botin that Banco Santander was the first and only private
enterprise in Chile to donate economic support to help fight the
air pollution problem.  At the meeting, Botin said: "I am
convinced that Santiago will resolve this problem, and we at the
Banco Santander will be very proud to have actively participated
in it."  According to Federico Ysart, corporate communications
manager with the bank in Madrid, Spain, the idea came from bank
employees in Santiago, "who live with the smog daily."  "The
bank's management in Spain saw this as a good opportunity to share
some of the benefits the bank has been enjoying from its
operations in Chile recently," he told EWLA.
     The environmental team, which begins work in November, will
consist of about 10 people.  "Although the team will principally
study sources of air pollution, it will also look at sources of
water and noise pollution," said Ysart.  Currently a steering
committee with members from the three institutions involved in the
project -- Banco Santander, University of Chile, and
Decontamination Commission for the Metropolitan Area -- are
selecting team members.  By this time next year, the team is to
publish its findings and recommendations in a so-called "White
Book," which will be presented to government authorities and the
general public for review and comment.
     According to Urban Air Pollution in Latin America and the
Caribbean, a report published in September by the Pan American
Health Organization, Santiago is the third most polluted city in
Latin America, just behind Mexico City and Sao Paulo, Brazil.
According to the researchers, the air pollution problem in
Santiago, while exacerbated by geographic and climatic conditions,
is primarily caused by mobile sources.  Mobile sources are
responsible for 83% of the total nitrogen dioxide emissions, 78%
of the hydrocarbons, and 98% of the carbon monoxide."

Chilean Officials Review Environmental Laws and Plan New Ones

     The National Commission for the Environment (CONAMA), Chile's
governmental agency responsible for coordinating environmental
policy, is currently preparing an inventory of existing envi-
ronmental laws.  The objective is to better organize current laws
on the books, and find out where more laws are needed.  CONAMA
officials say many of the environmental laws on the books in Chile
are unknown, due to a lack of past enforcement.  Rafael Asenjo,
executive secretary of CONAMA, estimates that the inventory will
come up with about 2,000 existing environmental regulations.
     So far, CONAMA has found that current environmental
regulations do not adequately assure the protection of public
waterways from industrial or municipal waste, nor do they require
that toxic waste be treated and disposed of safely.  Asenjo
concedes that his agency has no information on how or where the
country's toxic waste, mainly from industry and hospitals, is now
being disposed.  CONAMA officials have also discovered that there
are no laws requiring that environmental impact studies be
undertaken before major projects are approved.  This will change
shortly.  Asenjo told EWLA that CONAMA expects to propose many new
environmental laws by the end of the year, including one that
will require such environmental impact studies.  Although
environmental impact studies are not currently required, a
majority of the large firms operating in Chile reportedly already
conduct environmental impact and feasibility studies on their own.

Chilean Salmon Farmers Oppose Planned Aluminum Foundry

     La Cooperativa de Salmoneros de Aysen (COSA), an association
of salmon producers, is alarmed at the prospect of having an
aluminum foundry built near salmon farms in the Aysen region in
southern Chile, about 1300 km south of Santiago.  Proyectos de
Aysen SA, a Chilean company, and Noranda Inc. of Quebec, Canada,
want to construct an aluminum foundry and a 360 megawatt
hydroelectric facility in the Aysen region, which would cost US
$1.2 billion.
     Salmon farmers argue that the pristine fjords in the Aysen
region, where most of the salmon farming is done, would
undoubtedly become contaminated, hurting both salmon harvests and
the environment, with an aluminum foundry operating nearby.  The
Aysen fjords are one of the few ideal places in the world for
raising Coho salmon.  The region is expected to produce 4.5
million tons of Coho salmon next season, worth approximately US
$140 million.
     COSA officials point to instances in Canada and Argentina
where aluminum foundries have contaminated waters and damaged
salmon farms.  Alcan Ltd. in British Columbia, Canada, is running
an aluminum foundry similar to the one Projectos de Aysen intends
to construct in Chile.  Alcan's foundry has been discharging 400
metric tons annually of fluorine gases into the atmosphere.  COSA
says tests conducted on the Columbia River in Canada in the early
1980s indicated the presence of fluorine in the water.   Fluorine
is the principal chemical associated with the production of
primary aluminum, and adversely affected the health and survival
of salmon there.  A similar situation occurred in Argentina.  In
the early 1970s, Aluar SA built an aluminum plant in Puerto
Madryn, which has needed more than US $70 million worth of
environmental protection equipment installed in recent years.
Salmon producers also say that even with the best purification
systems only 98% of the fluorine produced can be removed from
waste effluents, and typically the percentage is much lower.  More
alumina and chemicals are also lost to the environment in the
loading and unloading of ships at the docks, they warn.
     Proyectos de Aysen, however, is trying to assure the salmon
producers that they plan to take every precaution to protect the
environment.  For instance, they intend to use a closed circular
suction system to load and unload materials to avoid anything
escaping to the environment.  In addition, Proyectos plans to
conduct a comprehensive environmental impact study, and says it
will be in "constant contact" with salmon producers.

Venezuela Takes Steps to Clean Up South America's Biggest Lake

     After years of studying the problem, it appears that the
Venezuelan government is now taking concrete steps to begin the
cleanup of South America's largest -- and possibly dirtiest --
freshwater lake, Lake Maracaibo located in northwestern Venezuela.
Venezuela's Ministry of the Environment and Renewable Natural
Resources (MERNR) recently contracted with Delcan International
Corp., a Canadian environmental engineering firm, to design and
manage the construction of two sewage treatment plants and six
pump stations for the lakeside cities of Cabimas and Ciudad Ojeda,
at a total cost of about US $52 million.  The cities, which have a
combined population of approximately one million people, have been
discharging untreated sewage into the lake for decades.  In
addition, an Israeli firm is currently building two sewage
treatment plants at the lake's biggest city, Maracaibo, which has
more than a million inhabitants.
     According to Pablo Emilio Colmenares, president of MERNR's
Institute for the Control and Conservation of Lake Maracaibo, the
Venezuelan government began looking into the need to clean up the
lake as early as 1977.  The government spent years conducting
studies, coming up with grand plans and writing environment laws,
but in essence accomplished nothing concrete until now.  "The lake
should be healthy and cleaned up to international standards by the
year 1999 with the installations of municipal sewage treatment
plants, and new, tough environmental laws in the works that will
stop industry from polluting the lake," Colmenares told EWLA.
Government officials concede that industry has found it easy to
pollute the lake over the years because the weak environmental
laws on the books haven't been enforced much.  Government
officials say that will change soon.  (EWLA will examine in the
next issue the new penal environmental law the Venezuelan Congress
is drafting.)
     Environmentalists are very skeptical of the government's
plan.  "For 30 years we have been hearing about projects to clean
up the lake, and so far we have seen nothing," said Aldemaro
Romero, executive director of the Venezuelan Foundation for the
Conservation of Biological Diversity.  Romero said that because
nothing has been done, the lake is "a complete disaster, filled
with mercury, sewage, agrochemicals, and oil."  As far as he is
concerned, the government is all talk and no action.  "I don't
believe that the government is going to sanction or close down
state-owned enterprises, and I will have to see these sewage
treatment plants up and running -- not plans on paper -- before I
believe it," he told EWLA.  Meanwhile, business leaders say that
although the program has been delayed for years, they believe that
growing public pressure on government and industry is getting
things moving.  Said Guillermo Cardenas of Petroquimicas
Venezuela, a state-owned petrochemical firm: "Environmental
consciousness is growing in Venezuela, especially around the
Maracaibo lake, and industry realizes it has to take steps to
clean up."

Peruvian Officials Push US Copper Mining Company to Cut Emissions

     Peru's Ministry of Energy and Mines recently ordered the
Southern Peru Copper Corporation (SPCC) to completely clean up its
sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions and other pollutants within the
next five years by building sulfuric acid plants and taking other
environmental remediation steps at its main site in the southern
coastal city of Ilo.  Such action will cost the company an
estimated US $90 million.  (Sulfuric acid plants capture SO2
emissions from smelters and turn them into sulfuric acid -- a
marketable commodity itself -- resulting in less atmospheric
pollution.)  SPCC, 52% of which is owned by the North American
copper giant ASARCO Inc., mines 60% of Peru's annual copper
production, making it the country's largest copper mining outfit.
     SPCC officials say, however, they were involved in initiating
this project as well and therefore are not being "ordered" to
clean up emissions.   "When the government of Peru issues an
order, it does so only after things have been agreed to," said an
ASARCO official.  But the same official admitted that "Latin
American countries are all becoming much more environmentally
aware, and this whole effort is an outgrowth of that."
     A multisectoral commission was convened in 1989 to study the
pollution problem at SPCC and develop a solution.  The commission
issued a report, which then became a supreme decree in 1989,
outlining short-, medium-, and long-term steps that SPCC needed to
take to rectify the situation at Ilo.  SPCC cooperated and
outlined steps it would take, including construction of a 140,000
ton-per-year sulfuric acid plant, at a cost of US $76.6 million,
which will treat 35% of the SO2 emissions produced at its Ilo
foundry.  SPCC will also pipe the tailings from the Cuajone and
Toquepala mines offshore at the bay of Ite, at a cost of US $16.93
million plus yearly operating costs of US $500,000.  The company
has also promised to build a water-treatment plant to treat the
sewage from its camp, Ciudad Nueva, in Ilo.  The commission
determined that a 140,000 ton-per-year sulfuric acid plant would
not be enough to clean up the emissions, and told SPCC that it
would have to double the capacity of the plant to 300,000 tons
within five years to take care of all the emissions.  "SPCC wasn't
planning to use all the emissions from its smelters to produce
sulfuric acid," said Manuel Pulgar Vidal, an environmental lawyer
at the Peruvian Environmental Law Society.
     SPCC has appealed the commission's decision.  The copper
company is reluctant to increase the sulfuric acid plant's
capacity to 300,000 tons per year because, company executives say,
the domestic market for sulfuric acid isn't large enough to absorb
all of the sulfuric acid that would be produced by such a large
facility.  They also say SPCC isn't well-positioned to compete in
the international sulfuric acid market.  However, SPCC is coming
up with uses for their sulfuric acid.  Sources told EWLA that SPCC
has begun working on a heap leaching project, which will require
the use of sulfuric acid to exploit several million tons of copper
oxides and secondary sulfates that have accumulated at their
Toquepala and Cuajone mines.  Officially, however, government and
company officials are currently negotiating to resolve their
differences.

Environmentalists Force Texas Oil Company to Scrap Exploration
Plans in Peruvian Nature Reserve

     Texas Crude Exploration Inc. of Houston, Texas, USA, decided
in September not to explore for oil in Peru's Pacaya Samiria
National Reserve, even though the Peruvian government had
tentatively approved in early April a US $24 million oil
exploration contract between Texas Crude and Petroperu (the state
oil company) for a one million-hectare northern jungle oil block,
known as Block 61.  Texas Crude's decision came in the wake of
protests by environmental groups and congressmen in Peru and the
US who argued against oil exploration in the wildlife reserve.
The company received over 1,000 protest letters, and an
environmental group picketed its Houston offices.
     Environmentalists bolstered their campaign with environmental
legislation enacted in September 1990 by President Alberto
Fujimori.  The legislation outlawed exploring for or exploiting
nonrenewable resources in a reserve.  The government, however, was
interpreting the law its own way and was set to give Texas Crude
the go-ahead.  After Texas Crude gave up its exploration plans,
the Ministry of Energy and Mines and the Ministry of Agriculture
repealed this law, known as article 71, due to pressure from local
investors.  Environmentalists, who are working to restore it, say
that foreign oil companies will still look carefully at where they
drill in the future.  Texas Crude said the whole episode has cost
them at least US $1 million: $500,000 on seismic data it bought
from Petroperu and another $500,000 it will now have to spend to
clean up its image in the US.
     The block was especially attractive to Texas Crude because of
its potential oil-bearing structures and its proximity to the
North Peruvian Pipeline.  The 856-km-long pipeline takes Amazon
crude oil from producing fields to Petroperu's marine terminal at
Bayovar on Peru's north coast.  Created in 1982, Pacaya Samiria is
a vast, swampy 2.08-million-hectare network of oxbow lakes,
lagoons, and flooded forest that is also home to the almost
extinct Amazon manatee and the pink river dolphin.  In the 1970s,
exploration companies pulled out of the area after drilling three
dry wells and making one noncommercial find.  Petroperu, however,
still operates in the reserve.  The cash- strapped state oil
company's environmentally unsound operations are a result of poor
maintenance and sloppy management, say environmentalists.
According to the Iquitos-based Institute of Amazonian Research,
over 200 hectares of jungle surrounding Petroperu's wells in
Pacaya Samiria are already contaminated by untreated water and
toxic chemicals used in drilling operations.

Peruvian Green Law Faces Uncertain Future

     Peruvian environmentalists fear that a new private investment
law being drafted by the government could sabotage sweeping
environmental legislation signed by President Alberto Fujimori in
September 1990.  Undermining the green law, Peru's first, wouldn't
be new to the Fujimori administration.
     Earlier this year the Fujimori government repealed two
important articles in the environmental law when it passed
petroleum and agrarian investment laws.  The agrarian law, for
instance, repealed article 71 of the environmental law, which
prohibited the exploitation of nonrenewable resources in protected
areas.  Article 71 formed the legal basis for environmental
lawyers' arguments that stopped Texas Crude Exploration Inc., a
petroleum company based in Houston, Texas, USA, from exploring for
oil in the Pacaya Samiria National Reserve.  (See previous story.)
     Industry in general, and the mining and petroleum sectors in
particular, have been especially critical of the controversial
green law.  For example, Luis Rodriguez Mariategui, former
president of the National Society of Mining and Petroleum, sees
environmental impact studies, which are stipulated in the law, as
just one more obstacle to starting up business ventures in Peru.
"The cost of an environmental impact study carried out by a local
company can run anywhere from US $20,000 to US $120,000, depending
on the size and complexity of the job," he said.  However,
Environmental Services of Fort Collins, Colorado, USA, which has
carried out environmental impact studies in Peru for such
companies as Mobil Exploration & Producing Peru, a division of
Mobil Corp., New York, USA, is telling its clients that "to meet
the full letter of intent of the environmental law an
environmental impact study would cost from US $400,000 to US
$500,000."
     Meanwhile, efforts by a multisectoral commission appointed by
Fujimori to outline regulations for the environmental law have
been stymied at the cabinet level.  Jorge Caillaux, president of
the Peruvian Environmental Law Society (SPDA) and a former member
of the commission, blames the impasse on the Fujimori
administration's "lack of political will" to make environmental
protection a priority.

Environmental Articles Included in Colombia's New Constitution

     Environmental protection is on the front burner in Colombia,
as evidenced by the passage in August of the country's new
constitution containing 43 articles specifically addressing
environmental protection.  The old constitution did not mention
the environment.  The environmental articles range from
prohibiting nuclear and toxic waste from entering the country to
requiring the government to protect the nation's biodiversity and
undertake environmental awareness campaigns.  The constitution
also mandates that the principles of sustainable development be
adhered to when exploiting natural resources, and gives
individuals, even though they may not have been directly affected,
the right to bring legal action against polluters.  According to
Guillermo Perry, Colombia's ex-minister of mining and energy, this
means that companies or individuals damaging the environment in
Colombia will now be held legally responsible, and will pay fines
and be forced to clean up their environmental damage.
     A new Congress, to be elected by December, will develop the
specific laws and regulations needed to comply with the new
constitution.  However, the government in power has already taken
some concrete steps to bridge the gap between the ideal
environmental goals set forth in the constitution and what really
occurs.  According to Manuel Rodriguez Becerra, director of
Inderena, Colombia's environmental protection agency, the
government approved in August the National Environmental Policy
Plan (NEPP), which outlines how the government plans to enforce
the environmental articles mandated in the constitution.  "The
NEPP calls for the complete overhaul of the government's existing
environmental protection sector, which is currently very weak,
uncoordinated, and operates on a shoestring budget," said
Rodriguez.  The new budget should about double, with money coming
from new taxes on firms exploiting nonrenewable energy sources,
and fines for violating environmental laws.  Rodriguez says the
government intends to create a Ministry of the Environment and a
National Environmental Council, which will include representatives
from all government ministries.   The government also will create
a series of decentralized regional environmental protection
offices throughout the country to carry out protection programs
and law enforcement.
     The environment will also become an important factor in the
marketplace, say government officials.  For example, the NEPP
proposes pollution taxes for polluters and subsidies for companies
that switch to cleaner, more environmentally benign technologies
and undertake reforestation and conservation projects.

Columbian Salt Plant Shut Down for Polluting the Rio Bogota

     In September the Colombian government decided to permanently
shut down Alcalis de Colombia, an old state-owned sodium chloride
processing plant that operated along the Rio Bogota, just a few
kilometers from downtown Bogota.  The reason was that an
environmental impact study performed by the US-based consulting
firm Arthur D. Little concluded that the factory was responsible
for most of the pollution found in that river.  Alcalis, which
produced 18,000 metric tons of sodium chloride yearly, was
discharging about 680 metric tons of chloride into the river each
day, five times the permitted level.
     The Public Interest Defense Foundation, which demanded that
the government close down the factory three years ago, said the
extremely high concentration of chloride in the river (213 parts
per million, against a permissible level of 150) was a serious
health threat to the local population, as well as nearby farming
and pasture lands.  Sources say that some pastures and cows in the
area may have been contaminated by the river's polluted waters.
     The National Council of Social and Economic Policy (NCSEP), a
high-level interministerial council operating under the president
of the republic, Cesar Gaviria, made the final decision to close
the factory.  NCSEP authorities admit that the plant was closed
down for economic, as well as environmental reasons.  "Alcalis was
using old technology, in debt, and losing money," said one
official.  NCSEP calculated that the state would have had to
invest more than US $10 million in new, cleaner technology for
Alcalis to meet the current environmental regulations.  The 300
workers who lost their jobs due to the closing are demanding that
the government help them.

Texas Petroleum to be Fined for Polluting Colombia's Waters

     Colombian environmental protection authorities are
threatening to fine Texas Petroleum Company, of Dallas, Texas,
USA, for not properly treating drilling operation wastewater from
its Velazquez fields.  Authorities say the wastewater is polluting
the Magdalena River, Colombia's most important river.  "There is a
strong possibility that Inderena [the government agency in charge
of protecting natural resources and the environment] will be
sanctioning Texas Petroleum for contamination of waters near its
Velazquez fields," said Alfonso Avellaneda, head of the
environmental department at Inderena.  "Our legal department will
be announcing the sanctions shortly, and these may include a fine
or the closure of the Velazquez fields."
     Inderena officials claim that Texas Petroleum, knowing that
Inderena officials could not (until quite recently) inspect the
area because it was controlled by paramilitary groups, was
deliberately discharging untreated effluent into two streams.
Furthermore, Texas Petroleum allegedly tried to deceive Inderena
officials when they inspected the area.  Avellaneda said Texas
Petroleum stopped the discharge of all effluent to one of the
streams and tried to convince Inderena authorities that the stream
with no effluent was the one that received all the treated
effluent.  Texas Petroleum maintains that the Inderena inspector
confused the two streams due to a lack of familiarity with the
area.  "We clean up effluents as a matter of course, as you would
sweep and clean your house," said Joaquin Escobar, chief
environmental officer for Texas Petroleum in Columbia.
Furthermore, Inderena says there's a big difference between the
way Texas Petroleum and Colombia's oil company (Ecopetrol) operate
in the area.  "We want to demonstrate with these sanctions that
it's possible to exploit the oil in this area without
contaminating its waters, as Ecopetrol does," said Avellaneda.
Despite all the rhetoric from the government, Texas Petroleum says
it has yet to be officially contacted about the matter, and argues
that it is innocent.  "Our conscience is clear, and we are certain
that once the technical information is examined, the company's
worldwide reputation for environmental excellence will be
confirmed," said Escobar.
     In 1987, Texas Petroleum was admittedly involved in
contaminating La Cienaga de Palagua, a freshwater lake near its
Velazquez fields.  It discharged into the lake salty wastewaters
loaded with chlorides, strontium, vanadium, lead, and mercury,
resulting in the death of millions of fish.  Ecopetrol was also
implicated in this environmental disaster.

Bolivia to Enact Sweeping Environmental Legislation by Year's End

     The Bolivian Congress is putting the finishing touches on the
country's first-ever piece of comprehensive environmental
legislation.  The environmental bill, which is expected to become
law before the end of the year, will also create a
ministerial-level National Environment Secretariat responsible for
developing appropriate regulations and seeing that they are
enforced.  "The principal goal of this legislation is the
protection and conservation of the environment and natural
resources in Bolivia," said Gerardo Aguierre, Bolivia's Secretary
General of the Environment and one of the bill's authors.
"Bolivia needs to develop economically, but not at the expense of
the environment; therefore, there will be incentives for
businesses to protect the environment as well as penalties for
noncompliance," he told EWLA.
     When this bill becomes law, say its drafters, the conduct of
business will change drastically in Bolivia.  For example, fines
and prison terms of up to 10 years will await those who import or
traffic in toxic waste in Bolivia, and for those who bring into
the country contaminating technologies that have been outlawed in
their country of origin.  In addition, the law will establish
penal codes for polluting the air, water, and land.  Environmental
impact studies will be required for all new projects, both public
and private, before authorities grant approval.
     Bolivian environmentalists are generally pleased with the
bill, although they say developing regulations and enforcing them
will be a tough task.  "The fact that there is an environment bill
that will soon become law is a big step in the right direction,
but we have to make sure that the laws and regulations are
enforced," said Christian Vallejos of the Friends of Nature
Foundation, based in Santa Cruz, Bolivia.  Luis Alberto Rodrigo,
director of the Environmental Defense League, an umbrella
environmental organization in Bolivia, praised the government for
having the political will to work with many diverse groups to come
up with the comprehensive environmental bill, but likewise
expressed reservations about how effectively the new laws will be
enforced.  "I feel that it will be very hard for the government
to enforce the laws and regulations without adequate mechanisms
and funds," he told EWLA.  He believes that industries operating
in Bolivia will have to start taking environmental protection very
seriously.
     The legislation originated about a year and a half ago in the
Environment Committee of the House of Deputies, the lower house in
the bicameral parliament.  For the executive branch, the office of
the Secretary General of the Environment was also involved in
drafting the bill.  Two previous environmental bills did not
survive, according to Aguierre, because they tried to cover too
much and thus were too vague.  The current bill, however, is
expected to survive the process and become law.  "A general draft
of the bill unanimously passed in the House in early October, and
now legislators are carefully reviewing each of the 121 articles
and making any needed changes," Aguierre told EWLA.  Once the
House passes the entire bill, including all of the articles, it
will go to the Senate for a similar process.  But if the Senate
makes any changes, then it will have to be approved again by the
House.  The exact same bill has to be approved in both chambers
before it can go to the president of the republic, Jaime Paz
Zamora.

Central American Nations to Ban Toxic Waste Imports

     The Interparliamentary Central American Commission of
Environment and Development (ICACED), which convened with all its
42 members for the first time 23-26 October in Guatemala City,
Guatemala, urged all member nations to ban the importation of
toxic waste.  "We recognize that we have serious environmental
problems to address, the principal one being to protect Central
America from the industrialized nations' intent on making us their
toxic waste dump," said Arturo Amiel Escobar, a Guatemalan
legislator and the general coordinator of the event.  The
commission, which is made up of legislators from each country's
congressional environment committees, also called for steps to be
taken to clean up Central America's cities, and halt deforestation
on the Central American isthmus.
     Panama and Belize are the only two Central American countries
that have already outlawed toxic waste imports, but sources say
the remaining five are not far behind.  "Following the meeting,
the Guatemalan Congress began working on modifying the nation's
environmental law to include the prohibition of any type of toxic
waste from entering this country," Amiel told EWLA.  In addition
to calling for a ban on toxic waste imports, the participants at
the meeting also called on Central American industry to work
together with the governments to protect the environment.  "Our
objective is to give the private sector incentives to protect the
environment, and work toward a consensus between government and
industry on how to protect the environment, because otherwise it
won't work," said Amiel.
     The ICACED was created in August 1990, with the ratification
of the Central American Environmental Protection Agreement by the
member nations.  The Central American presidents decided at a
summit in February 1989 to create the pan-Central American
organization to allow the region's governments to work together to
develop coordinated environmental laws.  The commission's
executive committee, which consists of the presidents of each
country's congressional environment committee, meets every three
months to discuss legislative initiatives in the areas of
environmental protection and economic development and takes back
the commission's recommendations to their colleagues for action.

"Chemical Prospecting" Unites Costa Rica and US Pharmaceutical
Firm

     Merck & Co., Inc., one of the word's largest pharmaceutical
firms, has agreed to pay a Costa Rican conservation group US $1
million to provide Merck with plant and insect samples that might
lead to the development of new products.  The two-year renewable
agreement is believed to be one of the first in the world, said
Rodrigo Gamez, director of Costa Rica's nonprofit National
Institute of Biodiversity of Costa Rica (INBio).  INBio will
supply Merck with the chemical makeup of environmental samples
exhibiting desirable characteristics, such as freedom from fungus
or other biologically destructive organisms.
     The agreement calls for INBio to receive royalties from the
sales of any marketable products that result from the research.
INBio will use some of the US $1 million to pay for certain
start-up expenses, but part of the money, and later a percentage
of the royalties, will be earmarked for Costa Rica's conservation
efforts, including its famed national parks system, which covers
25% of the country.
     "This agreement gives Merck access to the amazing collection
of biological specimens found in Costa Rica, while working with an
organization that will protect and conserve the habitats from
which these samples are drawn," said Merck's Pamela Adkins.  Gamez
said other large companies are interested in the idea of "chemical
prospecting," but he was reluctant to reveal who they were.  He
was optimistic, though, that agreements such as the one with Merck
could become a lucrative source of income to the country.  "This
could become as lucrative as the country's coffee and banana
exports," he said.
     The INBio, created in 1989 at the recommendation of the Costa
Rican government, is currently engaged in the inventory,
identification, and classification of the country's diverse wealth
of flora and fauna.  At least a half a million species of
organisms exist in Costa Rica's tropical habitat.

EC Breaks With Free Trade Dogma in Landmark Waste Accord

     Shattering visions that Europe's giant single market for
goods should extend to trash too, the EC's environment ministers
sealed an historic agreement on 20 October that allows governments
to turn away shipments from other EC members of waste destined for
disposal in dumps or incinerators.
     For the first time ever the ministers also convinced the
European Commission, the Community's executive, to let them base
the packet of new waste rules on the environmental provisions of
the EC's treaty rather than on articles that promote open trade.
The move represents an almost heretical departure from the
Commission's long-standing dogma that waste should be considered
as a tradeable commodity, and opens the door for governments to
operate tougher national restrictions than the EC text foresees.
     EC Environment Commissioner Karel Van Miert defended the
Commission's capitulation as a one-off concession granted in the
face of enormous political pressure for stringent waste trade
restrictions from several governments, particularly France.  "What
we accepted was that the logic of the internal market should not
prevail" when it came to combating "waste tourism," he said.  The
decision did not signify any lasting change in the Commission's
waste policy, he argued.
     But triumphant French officials hailed the executive's
decision as a major victory for the environment over free trade,
as well as a crucial precedent for the Community and, more
importantly, efforts to reform the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT).  "The text clearly gives preeminence to
environmental protection over commerce," said French Environment
Minister Segolene Royal.
     Secretary-General of the European Federation of Waste
Management Dieter Vogt told EWWE he expected that Germany would
now seek a similarly nonharmonized approach to proposed EC
packaging legislation so that Bonn could maintain its far-
reaching national recycling rules, which other countries complain
pose a barrier to imports.
     Private court action seems likely to be launched sooner or
later to determine whether the text agreed by the Council of
environment ministers is legal under the EC's founding Treaty of
Rome.  Although Van Miert told ministers that the Commission did
not intend to challenge its legality -- a categorical assurance
that took Commission waste experts by surprise -- waste industry
officials said they would consider taking legal action to have the
legislation annulled on the grounds that it breaches the treaty's
free trade provisions.

A Panoply of Rules

     The regulation1, arduously negotiated over almost two years,
amounts to a landmark panoply of new rules for controlling
cross-border trade in waste not only within the 12-member bloc,
but also with the rest of the world.
     It covers virtually all kinds of waste except nuclear
materials, for which the EC has separate rules.  A key aim is to
bring EC practices into line with the requirements of the 1989
Basel Convention, which seek to limit international shipments of
hazardous waste, so that the Community and national governments
can ratify the pact.  Instead of distinguishing between hazardous
and nonhazardous waste, the regulation tailors the severity of its
control mechanisms according to whether trash is destined for
final disposal or for "recovery" -- meaning re-use, recycling, or
incineration to produce energy.  Controls on waste for disposal
are strictest.  The regulation bans the export of trash for
disposal to all countries except to European Free Trade
Association (EFTA) states that are also parties to the Basel
Convention.
     Export of waste for recovery is also banned in principle but
permitted to three groups of nations: members of the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that have agreed
to apply a common system of controls on movements of such waste
among themselves (so far Japan has not); parties to the Basel
Convention; and nations with which the Community concludes
agreements or arrangements guaranteeing, as the Basel Convention
requires, "environmentally sound" management of the waste at its
destination.
     The inclusion of this last group allows the Community to
continue exporting recoverable waste, including toxic materials,
to many developing or newly industrialized countries as well as to
eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.  (This will not apply
to 69 countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific Rim, to
which the EC has banned all waste exports at their request).  The
environmental organization Greenpeace accused the ministers of
hypocrisy over this decision, arguing that all waste exports to
these states should be prohibited since unscrupulous traders were
increasingly using the pretext of recycling to dump hazardous
garbage in nations with inadequate import controls.
     The export rules also fall short of meeting the European
Parliament's repeated calls for a halt to all EC waste exports to
countries outside the OECD, the club of rich industrialized
nations, from the year 2000.  Ministers went some way toward
satisfying those demands, however, by building in a series of
safeguards.  All exports will be forbidden when a country has not
specifically consented to receive the waste or when authorities in
the EC nation of dispatch suspect it would not be treated in an
environmentally sound way.
     Moreover, the Commission will periodically review the
third-party agreements -- for the first time by the end of 1996 --
and can propose a ban on exports if the environmental guarantees
turn out to be insufficient.
     The regulation's innovation, however, is that for the first
time it explicitly permits public authorities within the Community
to entirely ban or systematically block imports of nonrecoverable
garbage from other EC states.
     The provision is inspired largely by France's decision in
August to ban imports of household waste for disposal in French
landfills after potentially hazardous hospital garbage was
discovered mixed in with some consignments from Germany.  Bonn's
support for the ban -- once it had swallowed its anger at the lack
of warning from Paris -- was vital in getting the rest of the
Council to back France's restrictive approach.  Having exported a
staggering 700,000 metric tons of household waste to French tips
last year, Germany is now having to redouble efforts to build up
its waste disposal capacity after years of public opposition to
construction of new facilities.

Accord Cites EC Treaty

     The text agreed by ministers stipulates that, to put into
practice the principles that waste should be disposed of as close
as possible to its source and that both the EC and its individual
members should become self-sufficient in waste disposal, "member
states may take measures in accordance with the [EC] treaty to
prohibit generally or partially or to object systematically to
shipments of waste."
     Governments will not be allowed, however, to keep out imports
of hazardous waste from other EC countries that produce so little
that it would be uneconomical to build their own disposal
installations.  This stipulation is intended to ensure that small
states like Luxembourg, Ireland, Portugal, and Belgium get
continued access to specialized disposal facilities elsewhere in
the bloc.
     Van Miert said he had insisted that ministers insert the
reference to the treaty, the EC's equivalent of the Bible, to lend
the regulation a stronger Community dimension and avoid giving the
impression that it allowed the "renationalization" of waste
policy.  "It was important to have the reference to the treaty so
that we were not just reimposing national boundaries," he told
reporters.  Van Miert also persuaded the Council to declare that
decisions between member states would be taken in a spirit of
cooperation.
     A Commission spokesperson said that inclusion of the treaty
reference would act as a constraint on authorities' scope for
imposing bans by underlining that their import policy had to
observe the treaty's golden rule of nondiscrimination between EC
members.
     Another official told EWWE the phrasing meant that member
states would have to be able to justify import restrictions on the
grounds that the waste shipments posed a particular environmental
threat to them or could be treated nearer to their source.  The
text would lead to waste policy being conducted on a regional
basis since it would be virtually impossible to justify blanket
bans on imports at the national level, he said.
     In practice, the question of whether measures taken are "in
accordance with the treaty" is certain to give rise to differing
interpretations and lead to legal disputes, officials believe.
These would be for member states and industry to sort out, since
ministers refused to grant the Commission power to vet measures
before they take effect.
     Van Miert's decision to temporarily ditch the Commission's
traditional line on waste marks his first significant policy
decision since taking over as the EC's environment chief in July
 -- a job many believe he will retain when the 17-strong executive
is reshuffled at the start of next year.  But by going along with
the Council's thinking and pledging not to attack it in court,
Commission and industry officials say the studious Belgian clearly
exceeded the mandate his peers in the EC executive had given him.
     This mandate envisaged that Van Miert should reserve the
right for the Commission to take legal action, as it has done in
the past whenever the Council has approved waste legislation on
the basis of environmental provisions instead of single market
rules.  The Commission's position was bolstered in July when the
European Court of Justice, the bloc's supreme court, upheld the
view that all waste, even nonrecoverable garbage, is a tradeable
good.  As EWWE went to press it was uncertain whether Van Miert's
Commission colleagues would accept his decision or order him to
backtrack.
     Commission officials said he could have to eat his words
anyway if the Court of Justice again supports the Commission's
dogma in two cases against the Council that are currently before
it.  Underscoring his claim that the Commission's fundamental
approach to waste policy had not changed, Van Miert said the
executive would not withdraw the cases.  France's Royal told
reporters it was now time for the Court to fall in with the
Council's view that waste could not be considered a marketable
commodity like any other.
     Though waste experts at the Commission consider the French
ban on imports of household waste to be illegal, they do not
expect the EC executive, feeling frail as a number of governments
try to cut back its powers, to take any action against Paris for
the time being.
     Ministers hope to formally adopt the regulation at their next
meeting on 15-16 December if the European Parliament, which has to
be consulted about the change in the legal base of the measure,
can deliver its advisory opinion by then.  The regulation would
take effect 15 months after it is passed, although Germany may
call for more time to change the rules in its devolved system.
Governments have yet to agree on how soon the Community should
ratify the Basel Convention.
     Waste industry officials predicted that extra administrative
burdens resulting from the tighter controls on waste trade
foreseen under the regulation could prove too burdensome for
smaller companies and force them to sell out to powerful
multinational waste groups.  "I see Waste Management Inc. and
Browning-Ferris picking up market share," said Vogt of the
European Federation of Waste Management.

Tracking the Waste

     The regulation lays down elaborate notification and
information procedures for virtually all waste movements, which
give authorities a month or more to decide whether to approve or
refuse a shipment.  Ministers agreed at the last minute to require
that movements within the Community of waste for recovery included
on the OECD's so-called "green" (nonhazardous) list must be
accompanied by a tracking document giving details of where it is
destined and when.
     Belgium insisted that transporters should carry such
information with them to facilitate spot checks aimed at ensuring
that such waste is actually recovered.  Investigations in the
Flanders region had shown that 30%-40% of all green waste sent for
recovery never arrived at its destination, raising suspicions that
it was simply being dumped, Belgian officials said.
     Under the regulation, exports of green list waste for
recovery would be subject to no special controls unless an
importing country required them.  But ministers, largely at the
instigation of The Netherlands, agreed that the Community should
be able to impose controls on such waste if it proves to have
hazardous traits.  Greenpeace argues that although the list
primarily groups inoffensive materials like glass and paper, the
US has succeeded in persuading its OECD partners to include heavy
metals that could prove harmful in certain circumstances.

OECD Report on Packaging Waste Favors Industry Solutions

     A report on Reduction and Recycling of Packaging Waste,
released this month by the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) and written by James McCarthy of the US
Congressional Research Service, cites different definitions and
different ways of compiling data on waste and recycling as a
barrier to effective waste reduction and management.  The OECD
expects the report to provide a common basis for regulators to
develop and refine national programs to reduce packaging waste.
The report carefully avoids direct criticism of individual OECD
member countries, but seems to favor waste reduction programs that
place the financial and logistical burden of reducing packaging
waste on industry rather than on local governments.
     "There is no standard definition of recycling in use in most
OECD countries and certainly no definition accepted by the OECD as
a whole," the report says.  "With many countries setting goals for
recycling ... and many wishing to make intercountry comparisons,
improved data are now particularly important."  Recycling
statistics vary widely by country; some include industrial waste,
postconsumer waste, or contaminants, while others exclude them.
Countries also use different methods to account for imported and
exported waste.
     The key issues mentioned in the report are:

     * Application of the "polluter pays" principle.  Comparing
the US, New Zealand, and Japan (where "it appears that ... the
government will pay the additional costs of recycling through
local governments") with Europe (where "regulators favor placing
the financial and logistical burden of reducing waste on
industry"), the report concludes that "there are clear advantages
to holding industry responsible" for packaging waste management.
If industry collects the materials, the report notes, there is an
incentive to reduce waste generation through lighter materials or
reusable packaging.  Governments are likely to be less responsive
than industry to market signals and may also run out of funding to
sustain effective recycling programs.
     * Primary opportunities.  Improved recapture rates can be
achieved with all materials, according to the report, but
corrugated containers and glass offer the best opportunities
because they do not pose major logistical problems and they make
up a large amount of packaging waste.
     * Packaging restrictions.  The report points out that banning
specific packaging materials or using economic instruments to
curtail their use might be a controversial option.  "In free
market economies, consumer choice is a fundamental value.
Limitations of consumer choice are not taken lightly....
Questions arise as to the extent to which other considerations
(such as the protection of markets) have masqueraded as a concern
for protection of the environment," the report says.

     The OECD is currently working on a report on packaging and
financial instruments, OECD sources say.  That report could be
finished and approved internally by the end of this year.  One
OECD source, however, termed the subject matter "very sensitive"
(since the report will deal with taxation and other financial
incentives and disincentives to waste reduction) and cautioned
that it might take longer.

Eco-Emballage Gains Approval to Handle Waste Recovery

     Eco-Emballage, the system set up by the French private sector
to ensure compliance with France's new packaging decree, has now
obtained the official approval of French Environment Minister
Segolene Royal to contract to consumer goods producers and
importers.  To complete the approval process, it still needs the
go-ahead from the Finance, Agriculture, and Industry Ministries,
and the Secretary for Local Communities.
     The so-called "Lalonde Decree" -- named for former
Environment Minister Brice Lalonde and set to take effect in
January 1993 -- gives companies a choice between setting up their
own retrieval and reduction schemes for packaging waste or joining
a system such as Eco-Emballage.
     Because of the financial and logistical problems associated
with managing a nationwide collection, sorting, and recycling and
energy recovery program, many companies are expected to opt for
participation in Eco-Emballage.  Wine and spirits producers,
however, consider Eco-Emballage's participation fee too expensive
and have decided to establish their own system, Adelphe, to handle
bottle glass recovery and recycling.  Adelphe has independently
applied for government approval and will have "a separate
agreement" with Eco-Emballage to use some, but not all, of the
other system's services, according to Eco-Emballage spokesperson
Nathalie Laine.  Eco-Emballage expects to charge 1 centime (0.2
cents) per bottle during its first year of operation, and to
increase the fee during the following years.
     Eco-Emballage came into existence in August and now groups 17
companies, including Procter & Gamble France, Nestle France, and
Coca Cola Beverages S.A.  In return for its participation fee,
which is based on a company's annual packaging production, the
system guarantees to develop sorting facilities and find recycling
or energy recovery outlets for the packaging waste it handles.
     Eco-Emballage resembles the German packaging waste recovery
system, Duales System Deutschland, but there are some key
differences.  The French system relies on existing local
government collection authorities to collect and separate waste.
It does not currently expect to install packaging return bins at
the point of sale, as the German packaging law requires.  And
unlike the Duales System, Eco-Emballage will be able to incinerate
plastic waste for energy production.  The German system has had
problems trying to find uses for the plastic waste it collects.
     In September, Eco-Emballage signed an agreement with the
Duales System to use the German system's "Green Dot" symbol to
mark the product packaging of participating companies.  This
agreement will allow companies selling into both the French and
German markets to adhere to the collection and recycling
requirements of both countries by participating in one of the
systems.  The two will jointly use the "Green Dot" to avoid
confusion.  Laine says that Eco-Emballage expects similar systems
in other neighboring countries to eventually use the same symbol.
     Though the French decree does not set specific quantitative
targets, they are likely to follow once the proposed EC directive
on packaging waste is approved.  Quantitative targets will then
"fill out the rest of the framework" provided by the EC, says
Claude Reny, a French packaging industry expert.  For the time
being, "no one expects an effective system to come right away,"
says Claude Perrin at the French National Federation of Waste and
the Environment, adding that full implementation "is likely to
take several years."  Eco-Emballage's general target is to recover
75% of all packaging.  It plans to recycle three quarters of that
amount and incinerate the rest.
     With regard to the EC packaging proposal, which the European
Commission issued in July, Great Britain, which is president of
the EC's Council of Ministers until the end of this year, wants
the 12 environment ministers to hold a first debate on it at their
next scheduled meeting on 15-16 December in Brussels.  In the
meantime, it aims to get negotiations on the proposed directive
started between officials from the member states.

Dutch Eco-Label Misses Deadline

     The national environmental label that the Dutch Environment
Ministry hoped to introduce next month will be several months late
in coming.  Although the independent foundation charged with
preparing it is busy defining criteria for six product groups, the
criteria will not be ready until the end of this year, and
eco-labeled consumer goods will be available in stores by spring
1993 at the earliest.
     Development and administration of the eco-label, initiated
this summer by the Dutch Environment Ministry and the Ministry of
Economic Affairs, is in the hands of Stichting Milieukeur, a
foundation in which producers, retailers, consumers, and
environmental groups as well as the government are represented.
The foundation owns the label, defines the criteria used in
awarding it, and controls its use.  In considering a product
group, Stichting Milieukeur takes into account all phases of a
product's life cycle, from production to the waste stage.  Food
and pharmaceutical products are excluded from the eco-label
system, because in these categories rules for product information
already exist.
     Establishing the criteria for the first six product groups is
taking more time than expected, says H.G.M. Giezeman, general
manager of the foundation.  Stichting Milieukeur is currently
working on criteria for cat litter, shower heads, paints, gypsum
board, light sources, and paper.  According to Giezeman, "we'll be
happy if we set criteria for two or three of these product groups
by the end of the year.  Our plan is now to have the first
products with an eco-label in the stores sometime in the spring of
1993."
     Producers and consumers alike can make a request to set
standards for a certain product group, and the foundation has
already received a few requests to include additional groups.
After the criteria have been defined and published, a producer or
importer can present a product for examination.  The tests are
carried out by recognized certifying institutions, not by the
foundation itself.  If the applicant is awarded the label, he has
to pay Stichting Milieukeur a turnover-based amount for the use of
it.  The label is then valid for two to five years, depending on
the product group.
     The Dutch label will show a hand holding a stamp that prints
"Milieukeur," or "Eco-label."
     The EC has also approved an eco-label scheme, but "the
Environment Ministry and the Ministry for Economic Affairs opted
for a Dutch eco-label in addition to the planned EC label for two
reasons," says Giezeman.  "First, because the EC label is a long
time coming, and second, because it is quite possible that the
European standards will be less severe.  Of course we aim at one
label, but with 12 parties involved, [less stringent] compromises
seem likely."

No Green Christmas as EC Eco-Label Also Falls Behind Schedule

     Manufacturers hoping to win the EC's new environmental label
for their "green" products will have to wait until the start of
next year at the earliest.  Governments had hoped to get the first
goods bearing the long-awaited eco-label into stores this fall,
but the plans have fallen several months behind schedule,
officials from the EC and interest groups told EWWE.  "The truth
is that no products with an eco-label can appear in the shops in
1992," said one.
     Getting experts to agree on the cradle-to-grave criteria that
products should meet is proving slow going: to date they have
proposed standards only for washing machines and dishwashers.  But
the scheme has also been held up by teething troubles in the
creation of a 12-strong "consultative forum" of nongovernmental
interest groups that has to give its (purely advisory) opinion
before environmental standards for each group of products can be
fixed.
     Industry, the retail trade, consumer organizations, and
environmental groups have three seats each on the forum.  Trade
unions are angry that industry and retailers have refused to
include labor representatives in their delegations, while
environmental groups have withheld their nominations to the forum
until they receive financial assistance for participating.
Officials from the European Trade Union Confederation and the
European Environmental Bureau, an umbrella grouping of some 140
environment nongovernmental organizations across the EC, told EWWE
that both issues seemed likely to be resolved fairly soon with
help from the European Commission, probably enabling the forum to
start work by the end of November.
     Theoretically the forum could have been launched without the
environmentalists -- the other three groups have already nominated
their members -- but in practice this could have undermined the
eco-label's credibility.  Such credibility is widely seen as
crucial to the success of the scheme as it seeks to bring order to
a rash of claims to "environmental friendliness" by manufacturers
and to help the growing numbers of concerned consumers choose
goods that are genuinely "greener."  Some officials hope that in
the long term it will supplant the national schemes operated by
Germany and getting under way in France and The Netherlands,
leaving Europe with a single eco-label.
     If getting the first eco-labeled goods into the shops by
Christmas seems out of reach, there are hopes that at least the
criteria for the initial product groups can be agreed by then.
Proposed standards for washing machines and dishwashers were
submitted by a British-led working group of EC experts in August.
Once the consultative forum delivers its opinion on the proposal,
the way will be clear for the Commission, aided by a committee of
EC government officials, to fix the standards.  Assuming the forum
starts work soon, "I still see some prospect that the first
criteria can be adopted by the end of the year," one EC official
told EWWE.  "At the moment we're still building the slipway to
launch the ship, but once the year turns we're likely to see
things rolling forward quite quickly."
     That should mean producers and importers of washing machines
and dishwashers will be able to apply for an eco-label early in
1993.  Under the decentralized awards procedure decided by
governments, producers or importers need apply in only one EC
member state for a label valid across the whole Community of 340
million people.  Specially designated agencies in each of the 12
countries -- due to be set up by early November -- will be
responsible for awarding or refusing the label on the basis of the
standards set at EC level.
     After washing machines, paper is likely to be next in line to
get the eco-label logo, a flower made up of 12 stars enclosing a
lop-sided "E."  EC officials said a Danish-led group of experts is
close to proposing criteria for various paper products.  After
that may come detergents, although controversy has erupted over
the criteria: self-styled "environmental detergent makers" have
criticized draft standards produced by a German-led expert group
as far too lax and have set up their own trade association to
ensure they get a say in the rest of the drafting process.
Criteria for other goods are further off.  French-led work on
standards for paints and varnishes is months overdue and an
Italian-chaired group is still debating norms for packaging
materials.  Hairsprays, light bulbs, soil enrichers, and textiles
are further back still in the pipeline.

BAT Definition Changes as EC Permitting Draft Nears Completion

     Answering a key demand of industry, the European Commission
intends to remold its definition of "best" available techniques
(BAT) for limiting pollution from industrial plants to take
account of the techniques' economic viability and environmental
benefits.  The new definition will be written into the next -- and
possibly final -- draft of the European Commission's ambitious
upcoming directive on integrated pollution prevention and control
(IPPC), a well-placed source in the EC executive told EWWE.  The
17 Commissioners could formalize the proposal in the next few
weeks although it seems more likely that they will hold it over
until early next year (see "Denmark Set to Push Carbon Tax" on
page 13).  Once adopted by the Commission, the text will require
the unanimous approval of the Council of EC environment ministers
to get onto the Community's statute book, a process that seldom
takes less than a year.
     The EC's industrial lobby has been irked that the approach to
BAT taken by the Commission's directorate-general for environment
so far has not been based on cost/benefit analysis.  (This is a
complaint leveled at the department's work across the board by an
increasing number inside as well as outside the Commission.)  The
change now envisaged means that the Commission's definition of BAT
will be akin to what British requirements term BATNEEC ("Best
Available Techniques Not Entailing Excessive Costs").  "Just
because the latest technology can reduce emissions by 1% doesn't
mean you will have to use it if it costs three times as much,"
explained the Commission source.  Though the concept of BAT will
still be multifaceted and open to differing interpretations, the
explicit inclusion of costs and benefits as factors to be taken
into account will make it easier for industry to resist being
forced into making frequent and expensive plant upgrades as
BAT-driven standards are ratcheted up.
     The IPPC directive would require new and existing plants in a
wide range of industries, from energy production to large-scale
animal rearing, to obtain an operating permit from the relevant
national or local authorities.  It sets a framework of permit
rules under which emissions to air, water, and soil would be
considered in an "integrated" way, the aim being to prevent or
minimize emissions and the creation of waste in all areas
simultaneously instead of shifting pollution from one medium to
another.  BAT plays a central role in these rules.  The text
stipulates that BAT must be used to limit emissions of a broad
span of substances listed in a technical annex, particularly those
that are carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic, toxic, persistent,
or bioaccumulative, or that have a "bearing on global pollution
problems."  BAT would also have to be employed to recover and
recycle waste where such operations made economic and
environmental sense.

Flexibility for Existing Installations

     The permit would have to ensure that environmental quality
objectives -- whether set at EC level or locally -- were met.
Moreover, for each plant the competent authority would be required
to fix limit values for emissions of substances listed in the
technical annex.  The limits would have to be based on BAT and to
be at least as strict as those fixed by the Community (where
common EC standards exist).  There would be a degree of
flexibility for existing installations, however: where they could
meet the relevant environmental quality objectives without using
BAT, their emissions limit could be up to twice as high (though
not for the more harmful substances, and only if the less
stringent standards did not pose an unacceptable risk to
ecosystems or human health).
     Any plan to increase emissions would require approval from
the permit authority.  Furthermore, the authority would have the
right to reconsider a permit at any time in the light of
developments in BAT.  For plants where the relevant equipment has
been depreciated by 90% or more, the authority would be obliged to
toughen up the permitted emission limit values into line with
those attainable by BAT at that time.  Operators unwilling or
unable to upgrade an installation to meet revised standards would
have to close it within two years.
     Under the proposed timetable -- which, if past experience is
any indication, is quite likely to be stretched by ministers, at
least for some EC members -- the directive would enter force on 1
July 1995.  New plants could not start operations after that date
without a permit.  Existing installations would have until 1 July
1999 to apply for a permit and until 1 July 2005 to comply with
its requirements.  In practice this means that many plants
operating today may not be affected by the rules.
     Because BAT is about techniques, not technology, Commission
officials say increasingly stringent BAT-led limit values could be
met in many cases through improved operating practices without
having to make costly new investments.  "The idea is not that
(operators) would have to put in new equipment every five years,
although that's not entirely impossible," said one.

Industry Seeks to Freeze Permit Conditions

     Industry is wary of such assurances, however, and wants
permits to be valid for a clearly defined period.  The Union of
Industrial and Employers' Confederations of Europe (UNICE),
European industry's lobby group, proposes that permit conditions
should not be changed for 10 years "unless to do so would result
in a necessary improvement for the environment as a whole at an
acceptable cost for an average operator in the relevant industrial
sector."  It also rejects the yardstick of a 90% depreciation of
equipment, which in some countries could be achieved within as
little as five years, Commission officials said.
     The framework directive creates potential for an avalanche of
follow-up legislation by stipulating that the EC executive may
propose Community-wide limit values based on BAT.  These would
require approval by only a two-thirds majority in the Council of
Ministers.  The Commission source said, however, that his
institution was likely to hold off on proposing common norms
unless differences in BAT-based standards from country to country
led to distortions in fair competition within EC industry.
     Here, in brief, are other key details of the draft directive:

     * Permit applications must detail measures proposed for
preventing or minimizing emissions and waste, as well as solutions
that were rejected after consideration.
     * Permits should normally be issued within six months of an
application, though the deadline can be waived in certain
circumstances.
     * The public must be given the right to comment on
applications for permits before the competent authority makes a
decision.  The results of monitoring of plants' compliance with
permit requirements must also be available to the public.
     * The Commission will organize information exchanges between
national competent authorities on developments in BAT and
monitoring.
     * A committee of member state representatives chaired by the
Commission would have the power to revise EC emission limit values
in the light of BAT developments.

     Sectors covered by the permit requirement would be energy;
metals production and processing; manufacture of nonmetallic
mineral products; chemicals; waste management; pulp and paper;
dyeing; treatment or finishing of fibers or textiles; production
of dyestuffs, pigments, paints, inks and enamels; production and
tanning of leather; electrolytic or mechanical plating of metals;
printing; application of paints and varnishes; food canning and
processing; treatment or processing of animal waste; and intensive
animal rearing.  In some sectors the requirement would apply only
to installations above a certain size or annual throughput.

EC Finalizes US-Style Energy Labeling Scheme for Consumers

     Manufacturers and importers of a range of household
appliances sold in the EC will be required to supply prospective
customers with information on their energy consumption from the
beginning of 1994 at the latest.  Under the terms of a directive1
recently finalized by the Council of Ministers, the EC's
legislative body, appliances will have to be labeled for their
energy efficiency and product brochures must include energy
information.
     The scheme is the latest example of the Community's efforts
to harness market forces in the cause of environmental protection.
It aims to resuscitate a moribund energy labeling initiative that
dates from 1979 and was only ever applied to electric ovens.  As
governments look for new ways to limit carbon dioxide emissions
from power generation, the directive also seeks to prevent a
proliferation of different national energy labeling schemes that
would create new barriers to internal trade just as the EC and its
EFTA neighbors prepare to launch the giant European market on 1
January 1993.
     Initially, energy efficiency labels and information will be
required for seven categories of appliances:

     * Refrigerators and freezers;
     * Washing machines and driers;
     * Dishwashers;
     * Ovens;
     * Water heaters and hot-water storage appliances;
     * Lighting sources; and
     * Air conditioners.

     The text says, however, that other types of appliances could
be added to the list later, though only those that use significant
amounts of energy and afford adequate scope for improved
efficiency would be targeted.  The directive will apply whether
appliances covered are for use in the home or in nonhousehold
locations such as restaurants and hotels.
     The energy information must not only be displayed in shops,
but it must also be provided in mail order catalogues and to
customers who hire an appliance or buy one on hire-purchase terms.
Details of information and labels and measuring methods will be
specified in "daughter" directives for each type of appliance to
be issued before the scheme begins.

Rue de la Loi, 1041 Brussels, Belgium.  Tel: +32 2 234 6111.

New Report Forecasts Lower CO2 Emissions for Great Britain

     In the same week that British Rail announced a substantial
increase in long-distance rail fares, the British government
published figures suggesting road transport will overtake industry
as the principal source of rising emissions by the year 2000.
     In its Energy Paper 59, the British government details its
latest range of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions forecasts and
explains the methodology and models used to arrive at these
figures for the first time.
     The new figures update those given in Energy Paper 58,
published in 1990, and suggest Great Britain will emit around 10%
less CO2 than was feared in the earlier forecasts.  However, they
also indicate existing policies will do far less than the
recession or the closure of the coal industry to combat global
warming.
     On the basis of the figures given in Energy Paper 59, Great
Britain could readily bring its CO2 emissions back to 1990 levels
by the year 2000.  The forecast of Energy Paper 58 for the year
2000 was 174 to 206 million tons of carbon in emissions; Energy
Paper 59 only speaks of 157 to 179 million tons, compared with 160
million tons actually emitted in 1990.  The report suggests that
the earlier estimates have allowed the British government to set
itself achievable -- if not lenient -- emissions reduction
targets.  Achieving them is now made even easier by a recession
and a rapid switch away from coal-fired electricity generation to
power from natural gas.
     The difference between the long-term forecasts is somewhat
smaller; Energy Paper 58 speaks of 188 to 316 million tons, and
Energy Paper 59 stays approximately within that range, with a
forecast of 188 to 285 million tons.  These forecasts reinforce
the arguments that overall emissions will continue to rise if
energy prices continue to fall, and that the proposed EC carbon
tax is unlikely to affect the two most important future sources of
CO2 emissions: transport and domestic households.
     While the British government recently launched a public
campaign aimed at householders to encourage energy saving in the
home, its road policies are the subject of vocal criticism from
environmental pressure groups.
     At the recent review of the 1990 government "white paper" on
the environment, "This Common Inheritance," British Environment
Minister Michael Howard said he would be "looking at road pricing"
to limit environmental damage, but could not promise any firm
proposals in this direction before the end of 1994.
     Greenpeace UK says the British government "has no policy to
tackle the rising environmental cost of road transport....  With
the price of oil around US $20 per barrel, the economic cost of
motoring in the UK is now cheaper than at any time since before
the oil crisis.  But the EC carbon tax won't translate into a
significant price rise at the petrol pump."

Department of Trade and Industry, can be obtained from the British
government publisher, Her Majesty's Stationery Office.  Tel: +44

EC to Push for Methyl Bromide Controls, May Further Accelerate CFC
Phaseout

     The EC is to join the campaign by industrialized countries,
aimed toward next month's conference of parties to the Montreal
Protocol, to impose controls on production and use of methyl
bromide, a gas widely used for fumigating soil and crops.  The
decision reflects mounting scientific evidence that the chemical
is a hugely powerful destroyer of atmospheric ozone.
     Greece had resisted the move but backed down and fell into
line with the rest of the Community at a meeting of the EC's
Council of environment ministers in Luxembourg on 20 October.  The
ministers agreed that the Community should press other parties to
the protocol to bring methyl bromide into the list of controlled
substances at the Copenhagen conference.  The EC will push for
production and use of the pesticide to be frozen at 1991 levels by
1995, and for more far-reaching limits to be set next year.
     Molecule-for-molecule, methyl bromide is estimated to be
between 30 and 120 times more destructive to ozone than chlorine.
A scientific panel set up by the UN Environment Program has found
that cutting atmospheric methyl bromide concentrations by 10%
would be as beneficial to the ozone layer as speeding up the
phaseout of CFCs by three years.  But many developing countries
are resisting the idea of limiting use of the chemical, arguing
that alternatives for crop fumigation are costlier and less
effective.
     Differences between the 12 EC members meant ministers had to
leave open the question of whether the Community should push at
Copenhagen for an even quicker phaseout of other ozone eaters by
the industrialized world than it has envisaged hitherto.  Last
March the EC agreed to urge a 1 January 1996 deadline for a total
halt to production and use of CFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride,
and 1,1,1-trichloroethane (methyl chloroform) except for essential
uses for which no viable substitutes existed.  Now Germany,
Denmark, and The Netherlands, with some support from Belgium,
Britain, and the European Commission, want faster action.
     Ministers decided to come back to the question at a
coordination meeting just before the Copenhagen conference opens
on 18 November.  British Environment Secretary Michael Howard, who
chaired the Council meeting, said governments had agreed that the
March position "is not the last word."  EC Environment
Commissioner Karel Van Miert told reporters the situation was
still evolving and the Community could even agree on a more
ambitious position on methyl bromide before the conference begins.
     After Copenhagen, the Council aims to decide at its next
meeting on 15-16 December whether the EC should go faster in
phasing out listed substances internally than whatever new
timetable emerges from the Montreal Protocol conference.  For more

Service, 170 rue de la Loi, 1040 Brussels, Belgium.  Tel: +32 2

German Regulations Will Limit Gas Station Emissions Starting 1
January

     Two regulations seeking to limit hydrocarbon emissions at gas
stations in Germany will come into force on 1 January 1993.  One
mandates the introduction of the so-called "balancing" system,
which cuts down on emissions from the filling of gas station
storage tanks.1  In this system, a hose runs between the gasoline
truck and the tank.  Gasoline flows into the tank, while vapors
from the tank that would otherwise escape into the atmosphere are
pumped back into the truck, then taken back to the refinery to be
reprocessed.  This system is already widespread, and Josef Lerach,
an expert at the German Environment Ministry, expects it to be
"fully functional" within five years.  For new gas stations,
compliance with the regulation has been mandatory since 14 October
1992, while others have a grace period.
     The second regulation2 provides for gas stations to install
double-barreled hoses on their pumps to limit emissions from
pumping gasoline to cars.  Gasoline flows out, while vapors are
recovered.  The regulation does not specify the technical details,
leaving room for development.  It seems fairly certain, however,
that German gas stations will not adopt the US-type vapor recovery
system, which petroleum industry representatives have described as
"unwieldy" (and which would also not work well in Europe because
its effectiveness depends on a degree of filler neck
standardization that does not yet exist there).
     New gas stations will have to comply with the regulation as
of January, which makes it particularly important for the former
East German states, where many new stations are opening up.
Existing fuel stations will benefit from grace periods in inverse
proportion to their size to allow time for retrofitting. Large
stations, selling more than five million liters per year, have
three years to comply, medium-sized ones four years and small ones
five years. Existing stations selling less than one million liters
a year are exempted altogether.  Annual checkups are mandatory;
every five years, an independent expert must inspect the system.
     At the EC level, an initiative to combat hydrocarbon
emissions is taking shape at the European Commission in Brussels.
The proposal, which could be ready by the end of this year or
early 1993, would generalize the requirements that Germany and
also The Netherlands (where regulations requiring the installation
of vapor recovery systems were recently introduced) are already
putting into law.
     The plan, which like all legislative proposals would require
approval by the EC's Council of Ministers before it could enter
the statute book, marks the second stage in a Commission drive to
reduce hydrocarbon emissions from the fuel distribution chain.
The EC executive launched the first stage in August by proposing a
directive3 that seeks to cut emissions of volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) from storage facilities and distribution tankers
by 90% over 10 years through use of vapor recovery systems and
other measures.
     Behind the strategy lie the twin goals of cutting pollution
by low-level ozone and reducing people's exposure to potentially
harmful localized vapors of benzene and other hydrocarbons.
Hydrocarbons are one of the main precursors of ozone, creating the
irritant gas when they react in sunlight with nitrous oxides from
vehicle exhausts.
     To the chagrin of the oil industry, Brussels has followed the
US's lead in deciding against requiring large carbon canisters to
be fitted on cars.  Vapor recovery systems will be pump-based
instead.  The Commission's current thinking is to make fuel
throughput, rather than location, the key criterion: large service
stations would be the primary targets for installing vapor
recovery equipment.
     A minimum of technical harmonization would also be needed to
lay down essential specifications for pump and car equipment and
vapor recovery efficiencies.  Whether location will also become a
criterion remains to be seen.  An earlier suggestion that stations
in towns of fewer than 50,000 inhabitants should be exempted seems
to have faded.  Germany, with its approach based on the throughput
of fuel stations, opposes such exemptions on the grounds that
emissions pose a health risk wherever they occur, Lerach told
EWWE.  In Germany, the location of the gas station plays a role
only in that stations in more polluted areas (as defined by the
Lander, or federal states) have one year less to comply.

Study Finds Biofuel Drawbacks Outweigh Advantages

     A study commissioned by the German Federal Environment Office
(Umweltbundesamt), and due to be released soon, comes to the
conclusion that the environmental drawbacks of substituting
rapeseed oil for diesel fuel outweigh the advantages, and that
money subsidizing rapeseed production could probably be used to
more advantage elsewhere.
     The study tries to take a comprehensive look at the different
ways in which the use of rapeseed oil would affect the
environment.  It takes into account emissions of various
greenhouse gases -- in particular methane and nitrous oxide (N2O),
fertilizer use and runoff in rapeseed production, and the extent
to which rapeseed production (and the subsidies farmers can obtain
for it) interferes with a government program to let fields lie
fallow for a certain period to improve the soil.
     Its overall conclusion is that while shifting to rapeseed oil
does have environmental benefits, they are too small to warrant
such a shift.  Subsidies for rapeseed production, says Jurgen
Landgrebe, the author of the study, could be put to more effective
use elsewhere, for example in research on fuel-efficient
automobiles.  This conclusion is not likely to please the
agricultural lobby, which considers rapeseed production one way of
helping West European farmers at a time when they see agricultural
subsidies in general to be in danger.
     Experts at research institutes and in the German Environment
Ministry are currently commenting on the study, and challenging
some of the assumptions it is based on.  One main concern is that
the N2O level that the study's conclusions are based on may be too
high.  Reliable data on man-made N2O are relatively hard to come
by, compared with other greenhouse gases.
     A second study, by Guido Reinhardt of the Institute for
Energy and Environmental Research (IFEU-Institute) in Heidelberg,
Germany, focuses specifically on energy and carbon dioxide (CO2)
emissions.  Reinhardt, whose study is being published separately,
compared the overall amount of energy needed to produce enough
rapeseed oil or diesel to fuel a car for a given distance.  His
conclusion is that, in terms of energy and CO2 emissions alone,
the use of rapeseed oil offers significant environmental benefits,
but that, if one wants to take all factors into account, more work
needs to be done.

In Britain, Better Pay for Better Water

     Severn Trent Water Ltd., a British utility company, has made
a deal with its employees that may give them a good reason to
comply with EC directives on water quality -- a persistent problem
for Great Britain -- and cut down on customer complaints.  Two
years of negotiations between the company and the local unions led
to an agreement -- the first of its kind in the British water
industry -- under which workers could see pay rises of up to 23%
by 1994, provided that the quality of Severn Trent's water
improves.
     The basic annual pay increase for Severn Trent's maintenance
staff is 4%.  On top of that, workers have been promised "quality
performance" bonuses of 5% in 1993 and 10% in 1994.  The bonuses
are contingent upon the company's achieving its targets for water
and sewage treatment and customer services.
     Severn Trent will not, however, tie the payments to the
results of water quality tests.  Instead, workers will receive the
bonus when the number of customer complaints comes down.
According to a Severn Trent spokesperson, "We want the water
people drink to be of the best quality.  The only way we know we
are achieving this is if we see the number of complaints at a
minimum."
     Severn Trent employs 10,000 people and supplies water and
treats sewage for over 8 million customers in the British
Midlands.

Denmark Set to Push Carbon Tax, Ignore Packaging Directive in EC
Presidency

     According to a preliminary list of priorities drawn up by the
Danish Environment Ministry, Denmark intends to push for agreement
on an EC-wide carbon/energy tax but to cold-shoulder proposals for
common rules on packaging during its term as president of the
Community's legislative body, the Council of Ministers, in the
first half of next year.
     Copenhagen is hoping EC environment ministers will approve
the highly controversial carbon/energy tax proposal1 during its
six-month presidency, a goal many will find ambitious given the
technical complexity of the tax and the political raw nerves it
touches in several countries.  Denmark is eager for the Community
to bring in the tax to help meet its CO2 stabilization goal,
without waiting for the US, Japan, and other Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) members to take
similar measures, as the European Commission has proposed.
     Conspicuously absent from the environment ministry's list of
eight priorities is the long-awaited directive on packaging2
proposed by the Commission in July.  Denmark is among the member
states that have criticized the draft proposal, which in its
current form would force Copenhagen to scrap its long-standing ban
on the sale of beverages in cans.
     Denmark is, however, hoping the Council will reach agreement
on introducing a voluntary eco-auditing scheme for industry3 (see
News Briefs, page 16) and to approve tighter regulations on trade
in endangered species.4
     The other issues Denmark plans to work on are:

     * A yet to be published proposal establishing a common regime
for integrated pollution prevention and control (see "BAT
Definition Changes As EC Permitting Draft Nears Completion" on
page 7);
     * A directive seeking to reduce volatile organic compound
(VOC) emissions from fuel storage and distribution by 90% over 10
years5;
     * A directive toughening up emissions standards for
incineration of hazardous waste6;
     * The European Commission's fifth EC environmental action
program,7 and the possible development of further initiatives to
carry out the program; and
     * The discussion and possible establishment of procedures to
integrate the concept of sustainable development into all sectors
of policy.

     The ministry stresses that the list is tentative and may be
changed, possibly in order to accommodate any issues left
unresolved by Great Britain, the Council president until the end
of this year.  However, the ministry considers eight issues the
maximum number it can properly deal with over six months.

Europarliament Committee Wants Pollution Phase-Out Calendar

     An influential committee of EC parliamentarians is calling
for the bloc to draw up a timetable for completely phasing out
emissions of pesticides, phosphates, nitrates, and other
pollutants.  The demand forms part of a resolution the European
Parliament's environment committee has drafted in response to the
fifth EC environmental action program proposed by the European
Commission, the Community's executive.  The program, the main
vehicle through which the EC intends to translate the Rio Earth
Summit agreements into practice, will run from next year until
2000, and seeks to make a start on shifting the Community economy
toward environmental sustainability.
     The full 518-member Euroassembly is expected to vote next
month on the resolution, which the Commission is not obliged to
heed.  Spanish Socialist member Carmen Diez de Rivera, who drafted
the resolution, told EWWE the zero emissions calendar was one of
many long-standing demands of the parliament that had so far been
ignored.  Other suggestions in the paper include an EC-wide
referendum on nuclear power, creation of a Community inspectorate
to make sure environment rules are heeded, a standard tourist tax
to fund environmental maintenance of resorts, and payment of part
of the revenues from the proposed EC carbon/energy tax into a fund
to help developing countries and East European states reduce their
carbon dioxide emissions.
     The Community's Council of environment ministers is waiting
for the parliament to approve the resolution before finalizing its
own reaction to the program in December, the last procedural
hurdle to cross before the Commission can start implementing the
plan.  The program forms a comprehensive strategy of measures to
achieve defined environmental quality targets through cooperation
among all levels of society.

British Look at the Big Environmental Picture

     The British government has for the first time published a
comprehensive collection of environmental statistics.  UK
Environment covers a broad range of topics including climate, air
quality, waste, soil and land use, water quality, the marine
environment, coastal erosion, wildlife habitats, and populations.
     Not much of the information in the compendium is new, but
much of it has not been compiled into one reference source before.
The publication of the report also fulfills a promise made in the
British government's 1990 "white paper" on the environment, This
Common Inheritance, to make information about the environment
available to everyone.  Consequently, much of the information is
presented in the form of charts and maps for the layperson rather
than detailed tables for the expert.
     The report confirms that some environmental standards have
deteriorated.  Since 1980, sulphur dioxide concentrations have
declined, but carbon monoxide emissions have risen by 30% over the
same period due to an increase in road transport.  For the same
reason, nitrogen dioxide emissions have increased by 35% since
1986.  CO2 emissions have remained reasonably static over the past
10 years, but the relative importance of road transport has also
risen substantially for this pollutant.
     According to the report, accurate figures for the amount
spent on protecting the environment do not exist in Great Britain.
Nevertheless, the compendium estimates that some 14 billion pounds
(US $22.4 billion), or about 2.5% of gross domestic product, was
invested in environmental protection during 1991.  [Note: As used
in EWWE, the word billion equals thousand million or
1,000,000,000.]
     According to government estimates, the largest share of this,
6.7 billion pounds (US $10.7 billion), went toward water
purification and river pollution cleanup.  British water suppliers
are currently implementing a program of changes required by EC
directives governing water quality (see "In Britain, Better Pay
for Better Water" on page 13).
     Three billion British pounds (US $4.8 billion) was spent to
reduce pollution arising from all types of waste material.
Industry spent a further 2.4 billion pounds (US $3.8 billion) to
reduce air emissions, and just under 2 billion pounds (US $3.2
billion) went toward land cleanup and noise reduction.
     Overall, around 60% of identifiable expenditure, or 8.8
billion pounds (US $14 billion), was related to pollution
abatement.  Natural resource management took 24% and amenity
improvement 8%.  Less than 10% in total was spent on conservation,
research, development, education, and training.
     Copies of UK Environment, published by the British Department
of the Environment, can be obtained from the British government
publisher, Her Majesty's Stationery Office.  Tel: +44 71 622 3316.

Environment Budget Up in Spain, Down in Italy

     The Spanish Ministry for Public Works and Transport (which is
also in charge of environmental affairs) projects a 30% increase
(over 1992) in Spain's environment budget for next year.  For
1993, Vicente Albero, general secretary for water and the
environment, will have a total amount of 160 billion pesetas (US
$1.5 billion) to spend.  Water plays a major role in the
allocation of those funds; substantial amounts will go toward
coastal improvements, the improvement of wastewater systems, and a
new water management and protection plan.
     If approved, this plan would create protected areas for all
rivers, and would also set water prices to reflect the cost of
treating wastewater.  According to a recently released government
report, more than 100 Spanish rivers are -- at least in part --
extremely polluted, groundwater is overexploited, and 40% of all
Spanish reservoirs are entropied.  Under the proposed water price
policy, however, consumers in the driest and least-developed
regions of Spain (which use the largest amounts of water) would
have to pay the most, a fact that has already provoked negative
responses from consumers as well as some parliamentarians.
     At the same time, the Department of Nature Conservation
(Instituto Conservacion de la Naturaleza) within the Ministry of
Agriculture plans to invest more than 5 billion pesetas (US $48
million) in the maintenance of Spain's nine national parks.  The
Ministry of Industry and Tourism, for its part, expects to invest
a total of 48 billion pesetas (US $457 million) in a program that
provides, among other things, for grants to local administrations
and tourist industry companies that want to improve their
environmental performance.  Tourism is a key industry in Spain,
and surveys have shown that environmental quality is important to
visitors from abroad.
     In Italy, meanwhile, the environment budget seems set to go
down by as much as three quarters, as the country is experiencing
major economic and institutional problems.  This, at least, is the
cabinet proposal that the Italian Parliament is currently
discussing.  If the budget is approved in its present form, funds
for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs under
Environment Laws 9 and 10 will be trimmed substantially; funds
earmarked for a CFC phaseout and the stabilization of greenhouse
gases would also suffer.  In the area of public transportation,
the development of high-speed trains, which connect major cities,
would continue to be funded, while funds for local public
transportation are expected to go down.  At the same time, no cuts
have been proposed in the area of road building and road
transport.
     Substantial budget cuts will not help Italy's new environment
minister, Carlo Ripa di Meana, who has to accomplish three major
tasks: reorganize the Ministry of the Environment, badly
understaffed given its tasks and compared with other ministries;
improve Italy's system of enforcement of environmental
regulations;  and fight for funds.  In the latter area, at least,
there may be two partial solutions.  For one thing, Ripa di Meana
has managed to retrieve funds that his predecessor, Giorgio
Ruffolo, did not spend; normally, such funds would go back to the
Treasury.  The 30% left over from last year's budget will now be
available in addition to this year's budget.  Ripa di Meana is
also considering the introduction of "green" taxes and charges
(for example on land use), and the setting of fees for water use
and waste management to reflect their actual cost.  Revenue from
these sources may also help offset budget losses.

Norway Proposes Green Troops for Environmental Cleanup

     The Norwegian government has announced a preliminary plan to
establish an elite force of "green troops" to fight national and
international environmental disasters.  The troops would be drawn
from the regular Norwegian army and would be trained to deal with
oil spills, natural disasters, and nuclear disasters, and to lead
post-war cleanup efforts.
     Gabriel Lund, secretary of the joint defense-environment
ministerial working group that proposed the new program, told
EWWE's sister publication, the Global Environmental Change Report
(GECR), that the government will hold a hearing to discuss the
plan on 16 November 1992 and will publish its decision in
December.  The plan must then be approved by Parliament.
     Lund told GECR that troops would be deployed in two major
units: an emergency unit of 500 to 600 soldiers, prepared to
respond to any disaster within 48 hours, and a follow-up force of
1,100 that would be involved in longer-term cleanup efforts.  Lund
said that international requests for green troop assistance would
be handled through diplomatic channels and cleared with the UN.

Information Office.  Tel: +47 2 402 300 or +47 2 402 310.

NEWS BRIEFS:

     Former EC Commissioner for the Environment Carlo Ripa di
Meana is threatening to set up a European environment agency with
non-EC countries unless the bloc's leaders agree at their December
summit in Edinburgh on where to site the currently homeless EC
Environment Agency.  The colorful Ripa, who now heads Italy's
environment ministry, exploded when his French and Spanish
counterparts blocked attempts to get agreement on a location for
the agency at the EC environment ministers' recent meeting in
Luxembourg.  He also indicated that Italy and France would soon
come forward with new initiatives for reducing carbon dioxide
emissions...  Officials say prospects have improved that EC
environment ministers will agree in December to create a voluntary
scheme to encourage eco-auditing by industry after Germany did not
renew threats to block the initiative...  Belgium's
French-speaking Green party has put forward detailed proposals for
eco-taxes on packaging, throw-away razors, pesticides, and
non-recycled paper, but an agreement in principle, reached on the
issue by the country's major parties this summer, now seems in
doubt...

GREENHOUSE DISPUTE CLOSES THE CURTAIN ON BUSH'S ENVIRONMENTAL
HONEYMOON (NEWS ANALYSIS)

by Dennis Wamsted
The tenuous year-old truce between President Bush and the
environmental community was breached, perhaps irreparably, this
week as long-simmering differences between the two sides on
global warming, the pending reauthorization of the Clean Air Act
and Bush's no-net-loss policy on wetlands all surfaced in heated
public disagreements. The spark for the public split was the
president's speech before the meeting of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) here in Washington.

In his speech, Bush stressed the U.S.' commitment to the IPCC
process and "aggressive and thoughtful action on environmental
issues." As part of this commitment, Bush announced his intention
to host a White House conference on science and economic research
on the environment. In addition, the president reminded the
delegates of the U.S.' budgetary commitment to environmental
protection. The new budget includes more than $2 billion in new
spending for environmental protection, he said, with $1 billion
earmarked specifically for the U.S. Global Change Research
Program.

"That commitment, by far the largest ever made by any nation,
reflects our determination to improve our understanding of the
science of global change," Bush said. "We are working with our
neighbors around the world to enhance global monitoring and data
management, improve analysis, reduce the uncertainty of
predictive models and conduct regular reassessments of the state
of science."

Beyond this global climate change R&D initiative, the
administration has "already taken many steps...that bring both
economic and environmental research. Steps that make sense on
their own merits in terms of responsibility and efficiency, which
help reduce emissions of chlorofluorocarbons and carbon dioxide
and other pollutants now entering the atmosphere."

Still, the president refused to endorse immediate action to
freeze or reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the principal
greenhouse gas, in an effort to slow the projected rise in global
temperatures in the next 50 years or so. "You're called upon to
deliver recommendations which strike a difficult yet critical
international bargain: a convergence between global environmental
policy and global economic policy," Bush told the IPCC delegates.
"Human activities are changing the atmosphere in unexpected and
in unprecedented ways," Bush continued, but many questions remain
unanswered. "Together, we have a responsibility to ourselves and
the generations to come to fulfill our stewardship obligations.
But that responsibility demands that we do it right.

"Some may be tempted to exploit legitimate concerns for political
positioning," Bush added, concluding: "Our responsibility is to
maintain the quality of our approach, our commitment to sound
science and an open mind to policy options."

Bush's refusal to call for immediate action was assailed by the
environmental representatives at the IPCC meeting. The
president's speech "was just a lot of hot air," said Dan Becker,
the director of the Sierra Club's Global Warming & Energy
Program. Bush's promise to plant a billion trees a year in the
U.S. is akin to throwing sponges into Prince William Sound to
clean up the oil spilled by the Exxon Valdez tanker. "Sununu
won," Becker added, referring to the intra-administration debate
regarding global warming in which Sununu has taken the go-slow
approach.

The speech had "no new direction, no substantive steps" to attack
the global warming problem, added Brooks Yeager, vice president
of government relations for the National Audubon Society, who
said that the environmental community had hoped Bush would
endorse a CO2 reduction policy. Instead, the administration
continues to oppose even the automotive CO2 emissions standard
included in the Senate's version of the pending Clean Air Act
reauthorization. A national policy on CO2 reductions must be the
first order of business, continued Rafe Pomerance, who is
affiliated with the World Resources Institute.

These concerns were echoed by a number of the environmental
community's strongest supporters in Congress. The president's
speech was disappointing, Sen. Tim Wirth (D-Colo.) said. "We
ought to be doing a lot more right now," he said after Bush's
presentation, citing in particular the need for additional
emphasis on energy efficiency measures, alternative fuels and
population control. I am concerned that the administration
appears "unable to move forward."

Later, in a speech on the Senate floor, Wirth urged his
colleagues to act--even if the administration refuses to
cooperate. "It bewilders me why we do not take a leadership role.
It bewilders me why the steps that are so obvious to be taken are
not begin taken."

Wirth's comments were seconded by Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.),
who blasted Bush for his inaction. "Having shed his alleged wimp
image in the conduct of foreign affairs, the business of
resurrecting that wimp image in the conduct of our environmental
policy."

Similar concerns were broached this week regarding the
administration's commitment to clean air. "[Bush] has abandoned
his commitment to clean air for all Americans and even threatened
to veto the bipartisan compromise...now pending in the Senate,"
Richard Ayres, the chairman of the National Clean Air Coalition
said in a statement. "The administration is attempting to force a
back-room negotiation aimed at eliminating every single
improvement the Environment Committee made in the administration
bill."

NEW EPA RULE THREATENS VIRGINIA COAL PROJECTS

by Kennedy Maize
A unilateral decision by EPA Region III regarding PSD or
prevention of significant deterioration requirements for new
coal-fired generating facilities, "unless quickly corrected, will
delay and may prevent the development of generating capacity
needed for continued reliable electric service in Virginia,"
Daniel Bird, Virginia's Coal and Energy Commission chairman,
warned in a letter to Sen. John Warner (R-Va.) late last month.

In addition, Bird wrote, the region, which covers Virginia, is
being tougher on pollution control technologies than Region IV,
which covers North Carolina. As a result, "investment in
generating projects and the resulting employment and economic
benefits may shift from Virginia to North Carolina."

According to Bird, prior EPA policy based air modeling for the
PSD program, which governs the construction of new pollution
sources in clean air areas, on the assumption that sources would
emit at their historic rates. But EPA unilaterally decided that
modeling should instead be based on the maximum allowable rate.
"This policy change was made without notice to the public and did
not become apparent until project developers began filing air
permit applications during 1989," wrote Bird. "In March of 1989,
EPA advised the states that modeling on the basis of allowable
emissions would be required by October 1989."

Bird noted that many cases in Virginia show that "a wide gulf
exists between actual and maximum allowable emissions. Therefore,
EPA's shift in policy represented a drastic change that would
become effective while a number of projects that had been planned
and sited under the previous policy were in the process of
development."

Bird said he understands the reason for the EPA shift: The agency
has no assurance that emitters will not increase emissions. But
Bird wants EPA to come up with a transitional approach that does
not harm projects started under the old rules. "I would emphasize
that the commission does not quarrel with EPA's apparent
objective," Bird continued. "However, this rule's unnecessarily
large impacts and the lack of adequate notice...requires a prompt
adjustment in this policy."

Bird also said EPA Region III is "unduly aggressive" in
implementing "Best Available Control Technology" (BACT)
requirements. The EPA region, Bird wrote, "appears to be seeking
technologies providing 95 to 99 percent SO2 removal that have not
been adequately demonstrated to be effective and economic for the
same type of generating unit." But Region IV next door is not
requiring such stringent removal levels, Bird added.

Region III's ardor, said Bird, is also out of step with the Bush
Administration's proposals to cap sulfur dioxide emissions and
require offsets for new units. "Assuming that a cap is retained,"
Bird wrote, "total SO2 emissions will be controlled regardless of
how BACT requirements are applied." With caps, Bird argued, "no
purpose is served by forcing developers to a higher level of
control on new units than they consider economic. On the
contrary, a key principle underlying the president's proposals is
that the control be achieved at the lowest cost."

SRP: AN ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH PARK?

by Danialle Weaver
AIKEN, South Carolina--The Department of Energy's Savannah River
facility, located on 192,000 acres of reforested farmland in
western South Carolina, is a study in contrasts.

The site boasts state-of-the-art waste processing technology in
the Defense Waste Processing Facility (see story on page two), a
nearly complete facility that will render millions of gallons of
deadly defense wastes into a harmless glass matrix. At the same
time, the site serves as home to a weapons production technology
little changed in nearly four decades.

Like many of DOE's other weapons facilities, the site has been
designated a National Environmental Research Park that serves as
a refuge for five endangered species, including four bird
species--bald eagles, wood storks, red cockaded woodpeckers and
peregrine falcons--and one fish species, the short-nosed
sturgeon.

The Savannah River Ecology Laboratory, operated on the site by
the University of Georgia, has a large environmental monitoring
effort to study the long-term health of the site's wildlife. In
fact, because the site's 320 square miles represent a virtual
oasis of greenery compared to the surrounding cropland, the DOE
facility is an excellent place to study the effects of genetic
isolation and natural selection in closed populations.

At the same time, the site also contains damnable examples of
environmental practices that have long since been disavowed,
notably seepage basins used for the land disposal of liquid low-
level wastes and low-level solid waste buried directly into the
ground.

One of the site's Carolina Bays--formed when the glaciers of the
ice age receded--was formerly home for several typical South
Carolina species of flora and fauna, including Venus flytraps and
alligators. But heavy metals and volatile organics, such as
trichloroethylene, from the nearby seepage basins seriously
contaminated the bay, which is now nicknamed "Lost Lake" by
workers at Savannah River.

Environmental restoration activities, including removing several
feet of lake mud and draining some of the lake water, have
helped, and life is slowly returning to Lost Lake. Seepage basins
and low level waste burial grounds are being cleaned up, capped
with a clay cap impermeable to rainwater and covered with new
vegetation.

DOE LOOKS TO VITRIFY ITS WASTE PROBLEMS AT THE SAVANNAH RIVER
FACILITY

by Danialle Weaver
AIKEN, South Carolina--In 1992, workers at the Department of
Energy's Savannah River site hope to write a new and hopeful
chapter in the long history of the U.S. struggle to find ways to
safely store the nation's most deadly radioactive waste for the
thousands of years it remains hazardous to human life and the
environment.

The solution, says Lucien Papouchado, manager of waste management
programs at Savannah River for Westinghouse Savannah River
Company, lies in vitrifying or glassifying the waste. Similar
technology has already been successfully adopted in France and
Belgium.

Although several waste vitrification facilities are slated to
begin operations in the U.S. in the 1990s and beyond, Savannah
River's $1.2 billion Defense Waste Processing Facility is
scheduled to come on-line first. The wastes generated by nearly
40 years of plutonium and tritium production at the site account
for 56 percent of the radioactivity in DOE's inventory of high-
level defense waste, according to recent estimates by the General
Accounting Office.

It took "15 years of R&D" to come up with the processes that will
be used at the DWPF, said Richard Begley, director of the
Savannah River Laboratory and a vice president for Westinghouse
Savannah River Company, the facility's operating contractor.
Bechtel served as architect-engineer for the facility and
Morrison-Knudsen served as the primary construction contractor.
Groundbreaking was held in late 1983.

Westinghouse and DOE plan to begin a series of "cold" processing
runs with simulated radioactive waste in September. Once the
facility begins operating, it will take approximately 15 years to
vitrify the 34 million gallons of liquid high-level waste already
stored at Savannah River.

The majority of DOE's liquid high-level defense waste is
generated in the process of recovering the uranium and plutonium
from the reactors' spent fuel rods. Before they ever reach the
vitrification facility, spent fuel rods are soaked in nitric acid
to dissolve the cladding. Then, the fuel itself is dissolved in
an aqueous solution of nitric acid, and an organic solvent is
used to separate the nitrates of uranium and plutonium from the
fission products.

Before the waste is placed in storage tanks, the acid is
neutralized with sodium hydroxide, and the radioactive elements
settle in a thick sludge on the bottom of the tanks. The liquid
on top, called supernate, makes up about 90 percent of the waste
and consists of sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite.

The supernate, or salt solution, will then be evaporated at the
Savannah River saltstone facility, which is expected to start up
this year. The remaining "saltcake" will be treated to remove
cesium-137 and strontium, which will then be sent to the DWPF.
The saltcake will be mixed with cement, fly ash and furnace slag
and then pumped into a concrete storage vault, where it will cure
into a stable concrete. After the vault is filled, it will be
capped with clean concrete and backfilled with earth to isolate
it from rain and weathering.

At the vitrification facility, the waste will first be treated
with chemicals to remove the mercury introduced during
reprocessing. Then, the waste will be mixed with ground
borosilicate glass, fed into a melter and heated to 2,100 degrees
Fahrenheit. The melter is designed to turn a gallon of the waste
slurry into about four pounds of glassified waste at a rate of
228 pounds per hour. It will take about 16 hours to fill one
canister 85 percent full, according to Steve Sheetz, a senior
Westinghouse engineer.

Particles will be scrubbed from the waste gases generated by the
melter by water that is shot out of scrubber nozzles at very high
speed, trapping radioactive particles and separating them from
the gases. Any remaining particles will be caught by high
efficiency filters and a bed of sand.

From the melter, the waste will flow into stainless steel
canisters that are 10 feet high, 2 feet in diameter, and 3/8-inch
thick. The canisters, which weigh about 1,100 pounds empty, will
weigh approximately 4,800 pounds when filled, according to
Sheetz. The canisters hold about 3,700 lb. of glass. A temporary
plug will then be inserted, and the canisters decontaminated to
Department of Transportation standards using a slurry of ground
glass, Sheetz continued. Once they are decontaminated, the
canisters will be permanently sealed with a steel plug forced in
place by 70,000 pounds of hydraulic pressure. A 23,000 amp
current will then be applied to the plug for about two seconds,
resulting in a weld "far superior" than those from conventional
welding techniques, Sheetz said.

The canisters will then be transferred to a temporary glass waste
storage building, which Sheetz manages, where they will be stored
in below-ground concrete vaults until they can be shipped to a
federal repository.

All major operations at the facility will be performed by remote
control. Before equipment was installed in the facility,
engineers created full-scale mock-ups of the equipment to ensure
that it could be maintained and repaired via remote control.
Equipment can be removed and replaced using an overhead crane or
repaired in place using mechanical arms placed at strategic
locations along the walls of the facility.

NSWMA APPEALS ALABAMA HAZARDOUS WASTE COURT CASE

The National Solid Wastes Management Association has appealed a
federal District Court ruling that upheld Alabama's controversial
hazardous waste disposal legislation, the association announced
late last month. The court, in a January 12 ruling, upheld a law
that enables the state to ban shipments of hazardous waste from
states that do not have waste disposal facilities of their own.

NSWMA General Counsel Bruce Parker challenged the logic used by
the court in its ruling. "The issue of whether or not states have
complied with federal law to deal with their own hazardous wastes
cannot be used as independent grounds for allowing a state like
Alabama to violate the Constitution," Parker said, adding: "It is
our belief that the January 12 opinion did not address all of the
legal points we challenged in our suit and it improperly applied
some basic tenants of constitutional law."

The association is also concerned about the decision's impact on
the much-delayed Superfund clean-up program, Parker continued.
"We are sympathetic with Alabama's concerns that other states may
not have completed the required hazardous waste capacity
assurance process, but we can not allow Alabama to violate the
Constitution in an attempt to force other states to develop their
own hazardous waste management plans."

The association and Chemical Waste Management Inc., the owner of
the Emelle disposal facility affected by the decision and a joint
party to the lawsuit, filed their appeal with the Eleventh U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, along with a request for an
expedited briefing and hearing schedule.

The court's decision could have a negative impact on Chemical
Waste Management's stock, Debra Coy, an analyst with Washington
Analyst Corporation, warned in a recent issue of `Capital
Comments.' To date, the decision has not hurt the company's stock
price, Coy wrote. "However, we believe there's a good chance the
decision could be upheld, setting a precedent for other states
that want to restrict imports of waste, both solid and hazardous.
We also believe there could be an impact on landfill earnings if
some of the waste banned from the site is diverted to
competitors' landfills. We believe the recent court
decision...may be more worrisome to Chemical Waste Management
than most industry analysts have anticipated."

SENATE ENERGY HEARS KEY DOE NOMINEES

Two Department of Energy nominees received a friendly reception
from members of the Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee
during a joint confirmation hearing on Monday.

Highlighting his technical training, managerial capability and
public service experience, John Bartlett, nominated as director
of DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, pledged
"open, frequent and effective interactions with Congress" and
said he "hopes to achieve respect for DOE's management" of the
waste program during his tenure. Before becoming a DOE consultant
in November 1989, Bartlett directed energy and environment work
for The Analytic Sciences Corporation of Reading, Massachusetts.

Robert Gentile, nominated to become DOE's assistant secretary for
Fossil Energy, told the committee: "We're entering a new era in
which environmental rhetoric is being replaced by environmental
action yet we must at the same time be assured of an adequate
supply of energy at reasonable costs." Gentile was previously the
director of the Department of the Interior's Office of Surface
Mining.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has earmarked more than $17
million for programs aimed at improving water quality in
agricultural watershed areas in 37 states, Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter announced last month. "This is a part of USDA's
accelerated water quality effort for the 1990s and active support
of the president's 1990 Water Quality Initiative," Yeutter said.
"We're scheduling 37 hydrologic units areas this year and
anticipate another 37 areas in 1991."

NATURE CONSERVANCY BUYS GRAY RANCH

The Nature Conservancy has purchased the 321,703-acre Gray Ranch
in southwestern New Mexico, the Arlington, Virginia-based
organization announced last week. The purchase, for an
undisclosed amount, of the 502.6-square-mile parcel is believed
to be the largest private land acquisition in conservation
history. "The purchase of Gray Ranch is a milestone in
conservation history," said John Sawhill, the incoming president
of the Conservancy. "Few intact natural systems of this caliber
exist in the world today. The Gray Ranch also represents the
future trend for The Nature Conservancy and its partners. To
truly insure our natural world for future generations, we are
developing creative ways to safeguard much larger landscapes."

LUKEN ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT, DECISION LIKELY TO INFLUENCE RCRA
DEBATE

Rep. Thomas Luken (D-Ohio), the chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce transportation and hazardous materials subcommittee,
announced late last month that he would not seek reelection this
fall. The announcement, which was something of a surprise, could
have a significant impact on reauthorization of the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, which is now pending before
Luken's subcommittee.

The 64-year-old's decision to retire will open a coveted seat on
the Energy and Commerce Committee when the 102nd Congress
convenes next year. Chairmanship of Luken's subcommittee will
likely be assumed by Rep. Al Swift (D-Wash.).

HOUSE PANEL APPROVES TIGHTER STANDARDS FOR HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
TRANSPORTATION

The House Energy and Commerce transportation and hazardous
materials subcommittee last week unanimously approved legislation
(H.R. 3520) that would tighten existing regulations on the
transportation of hazardous wastes. The bill would authorize the
hiring of 200 additional federal inspectors to enforce the new
regulations, which would require the Department of Transportation
to register companies that ship hazardous waste and require
companies that haul extremely hazardous material, such as
radioactive wastes and poisons, to obtain federal safety
permits.

JONTZ LAUDS BUSH FORESTRY PROPOSAL

The Bush Administration's plan to plant one billion trees at a
cost of $175 million should be linked with a reduction in the
number of trees cut on public lands in the Pacific Northwest,
Rep. Jim Jontz (D-Ind.) said last week. "With the president's
proposal, trees are finally receiving the attention they deserve
as the most cost-effective means of addressing the global warming
problem," Jontz said. "But to be responsible stewards of our
nation's environment, we must also take steps to stop the
destruction of our remaining old growth ancient forests. It is
ironic that at the same time the president proposes to do a
better job replanting trees where they were once cut, we are
liquidating our most magnificent forests faster than ever
before."

Jontz, a member of the House Agriculture forests, family farms
and energy subcommittee, is the sponsor of legislation (H.R.
2144) that would significantly boost federal support for urban
forestry initiatives. The bill, which passed the House in
November and is now pending before the Senate Agriculture
Committee, would establish a matching fund plan for urban areas
interested in setting up forestry programs. The fund would give
interested urban areas a dollar in federal money for every dollar
raised from local sources.

DELAWARE'S ROTH PUSHES `CLUNKER' INCENTIVE FOR EPA

Sen. William Roth (R-Del.) introduced legislation (S. 2049) last
week that would authorize the Environmental Protection Agency to
provide incentives to remove pre-1980 model year automobiles from
the country's highways. There are roughly 22 million cars still
on the road dating from before 1980, Roth said, and these autos
are "some of the biggest polluters on our nation's highways."
Overall, there are roughly nine million cars dating from before
1975 and another 13 million from the 1976-1979 model years.
Together, these two groups emit 1.1 million tons of hydrocarbons
a year--or somewhere between 15 percent and 30 percent of the
total annual automobile-generated hydrocarbon emissions.

"In fact," Roth continued, "I have heard estimates run as high
as 40 percent when one considers evaporative losses and other
losses, and it has been stated that about 60 percent of the
transportation-sector hydrocarbon emissions in southern
California come from clunkers."

The clean air legislation pending in the Senate ignores this
crucial source of pollution, Roth said, adding that his bill
would amend this shortcoming. The incentives in the Delaware
Republican's bill would focus principally on the existing
Corporate Average Fuel Economy or CAFE system. Specifically, the
legislation would give the manufacturers of newer automobiles
credits under the CAFE program whenever a post-1980 model was
sold to an individual trading in a pre-1980 automobile. To
qualify for this credit, which would be based on the difference
in gas mileage between the two automobiles, the manufacturer
would have to prove that the engine block and body of the older
car have been permanently removed from the road. Fines for
companies that do not comply would total $2,000 per car.

The legislation would be beneficial to all parties, Roth said.
"I can foresee a scenario where the owners of these clunkers
become valuable customers when they drive onto the new car lot
looking for a new fuel efficient, low-polluting car." For
example, a manufacturer could receive a CAFE credit of some 30
miles per gallon (mpg) if a customer trades in an older vehicle
getting just 10 mpg for a newer one at 40 mpg. Further, depending
on the size of the CAFE credit, part of the bonus could be
earmarked for the buyer to reduce the cost of the new
automobile.

"Consequently, the bill is good for everyone--for the
manufacturer, the retailer, the owner, but most importantly, for
the environment. We need to encourage more fuel efficient, safer
environmentally sound methods of transportation. This would be a
very good beginning," Roth concluded.

LOCAL ANGLE TOPS ENVIRONMENT AGENDA

by John Egan
HOUSTON--When it comes to the environment, many Americans seem to
have adopted an "out of sight, out of mind" attitude, according
to a nationwide survey commissioned by Cambridge Energy Research
Associates. A majority of those polled said they would help fund
local environmental issues, but far fewer people would be ready
to fund more geographically diffuse and intangible issues like
acid rain and global warming, adds the report, released here on
Monday in conjunction with CERA's annual executive meeting.

The study, `Energy and the Environment: The New Landscape of
Political Opinion,' was conducted by Cambridge, Massachusetts-
based Opinion Dynamics Corp. for CERA.

Mandatory recycling was favored by 88 percent of the 1,250 people
questioned in the survey. About 81 percent supported a ban on
non-biodegradable products, while 58 percent wanted to encourage
mass transit use by strictly limiting the amount of automotive
parking in cities.

Six out of ten of the respondents would "definitely" pay a one-
time $50 fee to help protect the nation's wildlife and wilderness
lands, according to the study. About 54 percent would also pay
the same-size tariff to clean up polluted water, while 50 percent
said they would dig into their pockets to help dispose of
hazardous chemicals and toxic wastes.

"The environmental consensus will be a major factor in the future
American political and business landscape," Daniel Yergin, CERA's
president, told a press conference where he unveiled the study.
"The popular-based support for environmental improvement cuts
across traditional demographic, partisan and ideological
divisions of American society, and could translate into far-
reaching political and economic consequences."

But while the public thinks the environment is important, other
issues are more pressing: Approximately 53 percent of those
surveyed said the U.S. government should spend more to battle
drug abuse. Uncle Sam should also spend more on public education,
according to 42 percent of those polled. By contrast, 40 percent
supported spending more to safely dispose of dangerous chemicals
and wastes, while only 28 supported spending more to clean the
nation's air.

As the issues covered by the survey became more global and less
tangible, fewer people said they would be willing to dig into
their pockets to support remediation efforts. Specifically, only
one-third of those surveyed would "definitely" give the U.S.
government $50 to counter either the greenhouse effect or acid
rain, according to the study. About 35 percent of those
questioned would give $50 to help solve municipal solid waste
disposal problems, while 37 percent were willing to fund programs
to counter ozone depletion. Slightly under half those surveyed
would spend $50 to help solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.

Nearly 20 percent of the respondents said they would refuse to
pay extra for efforts to curb diffuse problems like acid rain and
the greenhouse effect. By contrast, only about 10 percent of
those surveyed categorically refused to spend more of their money
on visible issues like protecting wildlife or cleaning up water
pollution.

Respondents differentiated between open-ended and one-time
tariffs. By a two-to-one margin they opposed cutting pollution
through a 50 cent per gallon gasoline tax. A majority also
rejected a 25 cent per gallon gasoline tax. "Open-ended taxes
with no dollar limits to be used for purposes only broadly and
vaguely defined do not win support from most Americans as an
acceptable price tag on environmental improvement," the report
warned.

Sixty-two percent of those surveyed believe that economic growth
and environmental clean-up can go hand-in-hand. If the economy
and the environment were locked in a zero-sum struggle, 74
percent would choose to have slower growth and a cleaner
environment. Only 16 percent of those queried would choose
economic growth over a cleaner environment.

EPA TARGETS PESTICIDE CONTAINERS: Farmer cooperation tops 90
percent

by Paul Kemezis
A successful pilot program to clean up and recycle pesticide
containers in Washington County, Mississippi could lead to
similar programs in several states, according to Environmental
Protection Agency officials familiar with the program.

Small, state-sponsored container collection efforts already exist
in Oregon and Maine, but a large-scale recycling program had
never been tried before in a densely farmed region. In addition,
the Mississippi pilot program was the first time that pressurized
spray cleaners were used and the empty high-density polyethylene
containers were sold for recycling, according to Robert Denny,
EPA's pesticide program manager.

Iowa is currently considering a statewide program and other
states, including North Dakota and Minnesota, have also expressed
interest in the pilot program's results. EPA, which provided
$80,000 for the Mississippi program, may allocate additional
funds from its special projects budget for similar programs,
Denny told Environment Week.

Washington County, which is located in a major cotton growing
region bordering the Mississippi River, launched the project in
the summer of 1989 to prevent used containers with pesticide
residues from being discarded in landfills, burned or simply
thrown in ditches. Farmers were given high pressure cleaning
equipment donated by ICI Americas Inc., and urged to flush the
containers and retain the pesticide residue to spray on fields.
After they were cleaned, the metal and plastic containers were to
be deposited at eight collection centers.

Mississippi Agriculture Dept. officials who ran the program say
the results were surprisingly good. All told, the department
collected 52,000 plastic containers and 48,000 pounds of metal
cans. Using a heavy publicity campaign including video tapes,
slide shows and local television ads, they estimate that they
achieved a 90 percent recovery rate. The program was totally
voluntary.

EPA's Denny says a principal goal of the program was to test the
results of the pressure rinsing, which has been shown to be 600
times more effective in removing residues than traditional triple
rinsing. The rinsing is particularly important because it
provides a cleaner product to sell to recyclers. Nevertheless,
use of the recycled plastic is still somewhat restricted because
of its previous pesticide contact.

Robert McCarty, deputy director of plant industry with the
state's Agriculture Dept., says the Washington County program
will continue next year using remaining EPA funds. The department
will also ask the legislature to fund a statewide program. While
the program generates some revenue from the sale of recycled
materials, it is not planned as a profit-making venture.

Notwithstanding the success of the pilot program, Denny says it
will be up to individual states to initiate and fund large-scale
programs. EPA plans to help by developing rules regarding
container shapes in order to make cleaning easier and also on
what can be used to construct the containers.

COALITION URGES $1 BILLION LAND PURCHASE PROGRAM

Congress should make better use of the billions of dollars
authorized for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) to
acquire environmentally sensitive land and to create new public
recreation areas, a coalition of 20 national conservation groups
recommended in a report released last week. During the 1980s, the
coalition said, the unappropriated balance in the conservation
fund climbed from zero to more than $7 billion as the Reagan
Administration consistently failed to appropriate the funds
available. "During the 25th anniversary year of the Land and
Water Conservation Fund, we believe it is time to renew our
commitment to present and future generations through the
appropriation of $999 million in fiscal year 1991," the heads of
the 20 groups wrote in a cover letter accompanying the report.

Specifically, the coalition proposed spending:

 *  $253.05 million for land acquisition activities by the U.S.
    Fish and Wildlife Service;
 *  $249.18 million for the National Park Service;
 *  $242.98 million for the U.S. Forest Service;
 *  $200 million for state grants; and
 *  $54.15 million for the Bureau for Land Management;

The LWCF, which was signed into law by former president Johnson,
is composed primarily of revenues raised from leasing activity on
the Outer Continental Shelf and royalties associated with OCS oil
and gas production.

The coalition's report identifies lands in 46 states, the
District of Columbia and four U.S. territories that should be
purchased during the coming fiscal year. In crafting its
suggestions for land purchases, the coalition focused particular
attention on areas where there is a serious threat to land, water
or wildlife; willing sellers; existing acquisition efforts; and
existing or expected court orders that will require the federal
government to compensate landowners.

"During the fund's silver anniversary, we should be bold enough
to invest the $1 billion proposed in 1987 by President Reagan's
Commission of Americans Outdoors," urged Wilderness Society
president George Frampton in releasing the report. "Every day
there is less open space left in America, and unless we act
quickly, many of the natural treasures that our report recommends
for purchase will be gobbled up by subdivisions and other
speculators."

ARIZONA

Phoenix, Arizona's voluntary recycling pilot program has been so
successful in the past year that it will be expanded city-wide,
the city announced recently. The newly expanded program will
include 300,000 homes, compared to the 4,000 homes in the pilot
program. "This expansion will occur pending evaluation of
economics and end market agreements," said Jack Friedline, deputy
public works director for the city. "Full evaluation of the pilot
program will be made in the second quarter this year. If economic
analysis shows a benefit, we will recommend a multi-year
implementation program probably from 1991 to 1995."

NEW JERSEY

Wheelabrator Technologies has begun start-up operations at its
Gloucester County, New Jersey, trash-to-energy facility, the
company announced recently. The project is the first in the
country to be regulated as a public garbage utility, and will
operate under a tariff rate and franchise system regulated by the
state's Board of Public Utilities. Located on the Delaware River,
the facility will be capable of processing up to 575 tons of
municipal solid waste a day and producing 14 megawatts of

The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources has
revoked the waste processing permit of Philadelphia-based ACN
Inc. for violations of the state's environmental regulations and
standards. Improper storage of waste at the site and poorly
maintained leachate collection tanks have been of particular
concern to the state agency, which initially ordered the company
to cease all operations last May pending resolution of these
problems.

CONNECTICUT

Connecticut's Department of Environmental Protection has awarded
$60,000 in grant funds to municipalities in the state's Central
Naugatuck Valley to boost regional recycling efforts. The funds
will be used by the Valley's council of governments to institute
a comprehensive regional recycling program for the area's roughly
370,000 residents. "This is one more important step forward for
Connecticut's recycling movement," DEP Commissioner Leslie
Carothers said in announcing the grant award. "This grant will
help add more than 10 percent of the state's population in the
Central Naugatuck Valley join the large numbers of citizens
already involved in regional recycling around Connecticut." The
grant will help the Valley's municipalities comply with a state
law mandating recycling for nine items by January 1, 1991,
including: glass and metal food containers, newspaper, corrugated
and white office paper, scrap metal, automotive batteries, used
oil and leaves.

NEBRASKA

The Nebraska Department of Environmental Control and the Attorney
General's Office have filed suit in Hitchcock County against
Texaco Producing, Inc. for allegedly contaminating surface and
groundwater during the company's operations in the area. The
department is seeking to have the contamination cleaned up, and
to collect civil penalties and the cost of the investigation from
the company. "We have asked the court to make Texaco assess the
contamination and clean it up," said Steve Moeller, the state's
assistant attorney general. "We're also asking for civil
penalties of up to $5,000 per day, and the payment of $20,000 to
cover the cost of our investigation."

PENNSYLVANIA

Environmental protection efforts have been a cornerstone of
Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey's administration, and 1990
will be no exception if the Republican governor has his way. In
his State of the State address late last month, Casey announced
the signing of an executive order requiring all new passenger
cars sold in the state to comply by 1994 with the tight emissions
standards now in effect in California. "To set the example,"
Casey continued, "I've ordered that all new state vehicles meet
these standards, effective immediately. In addition, we're going
to toughen up inspection standards so they cover emission control
devices."

ARB MODIFIES ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE MANDATE

SACRAMENTO -- The Calif. Air Resources Board (ARB) staff has
proposed changes to the current Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) rule,
scheduled for introduction in 1998.  The ZEV modification, endorsed
by Governor Wilson, would retain the requirement for full
implementation by 2003.

Background

In 1994, Governor Wilson submitted California's State
Implementation Plan (SIP), under the 1990 Clean Air Act.  The plan
set forth the state's strategies to achieve clean air by
implementing cost-effective regulations which encourage the advance
of technology through market forces.  One of the most controversial
elements of the SIP is the ZEV mandate.

Under the terms of the ZEV regulation, adopted in 1990, major
automakers are required to offer vehicles with no tailpipe
emissions in 2 percent of their fleets by 1998.  The number
increases to 5 percent in 2001 and ultimately to 10 percent in
2010.

An alternative to the present rule was requested by the ARB after
auto makers' projections indicated the sales demand for lead/acid
batteries with limited mileage ranges would not appeal to enough
buyers to meet the rules.

In response to concerns such as cost/marketability, technology, the
use of hybrids and the development of infrastructure needs, the ARB
submitted to the Governor, a proposal to modify the ZEV rule, while
maintaining the ultimate long-term goal.

ARB Proposal

ARB Staff's preliminary proposal is to drop the 2 percent
requirement in the early years of the program and build up to 10
percent ZEVs by 2003, when all car companies that sell more than
3000 vehicles per year statewide must comply with the regulation.
In addition, manufacturers will receive extra ZEV credit through
2003 for ZEVs sold before 1998 and those equipped with advance
battery types that have the range and lifespan that many experts
believe is needed to make them competitive with gasoline powered
models.  Those battery types, including lithium and nickel-based
designs, are expected to be commercially available by 2001.

The staff proposal would suspend the current ZEV requirements until
2003, and propose that auto manufacturers participate in a
partnership program to promote and evaluate the development of
advanced ZEVs.  All of the exhaust, evaporative and refueling
emission reductions associated with the existing ZEV requirements,
plus a premium, would be made up by the manufacturers through the
production of cleaner cars.

ARB staff has been directed to fully develop the plan and present
it for consideration at a public hearing no later than March 1996.

In his endorsement of the ZEV modification proposal, Governor
Wilson said, "This proposal...would retain the requirement for full
implementation of the ZEV mandate by 2003.  But it will also permit
modifications that both allow enforceable emission benefits that
exceed existing requirements and at the same time encourage early
development of battery technology that will produce ZEVs the market
will accept."

STUDY RELEASED ON DIOXIN EMISSIONS FROM WASTE COMBUSTION

NEW YORK -- The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) has
released a study that concludes there is no correlation between the
amount and type of chlorine in the waste constituents of combustion
facilities and dioxin concentrations measured at the stack.

The study, "The Relationship Between Chlorine in Waste Streams and
Dioxin Emissions from Waste Combustor Stacks," analyzed more than
1,900 test results, and concludes that limiting the chlorine
content of combustor feedstocks has no, or little, effect on the
composition or quantity of dioxin emitted.

According to ASME, the finding refutes claims by public interest
groups that there is a direct relationship between chlorine and
dioxin, or PCDD/F, emissions.  ASME says these groups have been
seeking regulations limiting the amount and type of chlorinated
waste that can be combusted in waste-to-energy plants, hazardous
waste incinerators, cement kilns, and other types of combustion
systems.

Copy Availability

A copy of the study is available from ASME, (800) 843-2763.

MARGETT INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO OVERRIDE CFC BAN IN CALIFORNIA

SACRAMENTO -- Assemblyman Bob Margett (R-Arcadia) has introduced
legislation that would repeal the federal ban on
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which became effective on Jan. 1, 1996.

AB 1996 would allow the use, possession, and production of CFCs in
California, despite the Federal ban.  The bill, known as the
California Air Conditioner Protection Act of 1996, would delay the
prohibition of freon until the year 2000.

According to Margett, "What we have, is a classic example of
state's rights.  The Tenth Amendment of the Untied States
Constitution gives states powers not delegated to the Federal
government by the Constitution.  Last time I checked, the
Constitution was silent on the issue of freon and CFCs."

"I wanted to take a reasonable approach to the freon issue.  In
giving industry a much needed extension to thoroughly study the
effects of freon on the environment while still protecting
California's consumers," Margett said.

More Information

Margett and principle co-author Senator Richard Mountjoy, are
trying to build a state wide coalition of consumers and businesses
in support of AB 1996.  For information contact Margett's office at
(916) 445-7234.

51-MONTH JAIL TERM FOR HAZARDOUS WASTE VIOLATIONS

WASHINGTON -- U.S. EPA has announced a 51-month incarceration
sentence for Reginald B. Gist, former operator of High Tech Plating
System, in Balch Springs, Texas.  Gist was sentenced for allegedly
improperly disposing and transporting of hazardous wastes generated
by his electroplating businesses.

In addition to the jail sentence, Gist is required to pay
restitution in excess of $75,000 and may not operate another
plating business.

Gist was one of the owners of the High Tech Plating from 1988 -
1990.  Following repeated notices to him by Dallas County waste
water control authorities that his business had been illegally
dumping electroplating waste into the sewer system, the sewer
connection was disconnected.  Gist admitted that he abandoned the
facility, leaving plating vats and 55-gallon drums containing more
than 70,000 gallons of hazardous wastes, including acids, cyanides
and heavy metals.  EPA cleaned up the site at a cost in excess of
$300,000.

According to court records, Gist opened a new company, Metal
Plating Systems in Forney, Texas, where liquid plating wastes were
dumped into the septic system and onto the surrounding ground.  He
also hauled liquid and solid plating wastes to property he owned at
Lake Fork, Texas.  When the Texas Natural Resources Conservation
Commission discovered the contamination at the Forney facility,
Gist was ordered to remove the contaminated soil and dispose of it
properly.

As part of the pleas agreement, Gist admitted that rather than
dispose of the contaminated soil properly, he transported it to the
Lake Fork property where it was either buried or dumped on the
ground.  Gist left the Forney location in 1992 and moved Metal
Plating Systems to Terrell, Texas.

On Sept. 22, Gist pled guilty to one count of unlawful disposal of
hazardous waste at Balch Springs and one count of unlawful
transportation of hazardous waste from the Forney and Terrell
locations to Lake Fork, in violation of the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act (RCRA).  EPA estimates that the Agency spent in
excess of $450,000 to cleanup the Terrell Facility, alone.

JUDGE REVERSES RULING ON FISH AND GAME CEQA FEES

SACRAMENTO -- Sacramento Superior Court Judge Jeffery Gunther has
reversed his previous ruling and ordered the Dept. of Fish and Game
to collect fees charged for the implementation of the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the review of environmental
impact documents of major developments in accordance with Fish and
Game Code Section 711.4.

The ruling was the result of an action taken by the California
Association of Professional Scientists (CAPS).  CAPS sued Fish and
Game to set aside a settlement agreement with private land owners
that required the department to cease and desist the collection of
approximately $3 million in annual fees.  Judge Gunther had
previously approved the settlement agreement.

CAPS argued that Judge Gunther's approval of the settlement was
unconstitutional.  Section 3.5 of the State Constitution prohibits
an administrative agency from refusing to obey a state law in the
absence of a ruling from an appellate court that the law is
unconstitutional.

According to CAPS, the settlement that was overturned had been
entered into after Judge Gunther ruled the fees statute was
unconstitutional.

In reversing his approval of the settlement, Judge Gunther strongly
expressed his unhappiness with the constitutional provision
prohibiting agencies from refusing to enforce statute law on the
basis of a Superior Court decision, but ultimately acknowledged
that the Constitution controls.

CAPS says an appeal of the court's decision in likely.

CAPS represents approximately 2,400 state employed scientists,
including several hundred biologists and related resource
professionals working for the Dept. of Fish and Game.

The fees generated by the Environmental Review Procedure, for which
the fees are collected, result in a significant portion of the
department's annual budget.

environmental technologies.  The lab will provide personnel and Lab
facilities to evaluate new environmental technologies seeking
certification under the Environmental Technology Certification
program.

According to DTSC, the agreement:

*Creates a wider, more diverse pool of available scientific and
engineering expertise available for the testing of technologies.

*Makes available additional scientific, testing and laboratory
facilities to evaluate environmental technologies, and

*Enhances the credibility of the certification through the
synergism of California's reputation for environmental standards
and Lawrence Livermore's reputation for technology development.

"Our partnership brings together the field and regulatory
experience of Cal/EPA with the research and development experience
of the Lab," said Cal/EPA Secretary James Strock.  "This
combination will provide a tremendous resource to the environmental
technology industry and allow for greater capability to certify
more technologies."

TWO ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES ENTER CIRCULATION

SACRAMENTO -- Secretary of State Bill Jones has announced that two
new environmental initiative measures have entered circulation for
petition signatures.

Beverage Container Recycling Program.  Wine and Liquor Containers.

This initiative proposes to amend the existing recycling law to add
wine and liquor containers to beverage containers on which
distributors are assessed a charge.  If adopted, the measure would
increase funding for recycling and anti-litter programs from
program-generated revenues.  In addition, it would provide
financial incentive for sterilization and refilling of recycled
containers.

The estimated annual cost of the state recycling program would
increase by approximately $2 million.  Additional recycling program
revenue increases are estimated at $20 to 25 million annually.

More Information

The proponent of this initiative is Mark Murray of Californians
Against Waste, (916) 443-5422.  He must submit 433,269 signatures
of registered voters to county officials by May 30, 1996.

Radioactive Waste Disposal. Initiative Statute.

This initiative would prohibit the disposal of low-level
radioactive waste in the state by means of burial.  It would
require low-level radioactive wastes generated by medical,
biomedical or biotechnical industries to be managed using
retrievable and monitored facilities.

The proposal would also establish a third party liability fund for
injury to persons or property from waste disposal, paid for through
surcharge on waste generators.  It also exempts the state from
costs or liability for waste storage or disposal, except for wastes
generated by state and local agencies.

It is estimated that the measure would result in one-time state and
county costs ranging from $8 million to $13.5 million, and ongoing
annual costs of approximately $1 million to $2 million.

More Information

The proponent of this initiative is Ernest Goitstein, (415) 369-
6690.  He must collect 433.269 signatures of registered voters by
June 3, 1996.

GOVERNOR CALLS SPECIAL SESSION FOR CONTINUATION OF METHYL BROMIDE
REGISTRATION

SACRAMENTO -- At the end of December, Governor Pete Wilson called
a special session of the California Legislature to consider
legislation that would allow the continued registration of methyl
bromide and pentachlorophenol.

Methyl bromide is a widely used pesticide to control insects,
mites, rodents, plant diseases, nematodes, termites, and for
pretreating soil prior to planting a number of agricultural corps.
Pentachlorophenol is a wood preservative used by all major utility
companies in California to protect power and telephone poles from
destruction by wood-eating pests.

Currently, some of California's major trading partners including
Japan, Korea and Mexico require methyl bromide treatment on
agricultural products prior to shipping.  New Zealand and Australia
require all shipments of products in wooden crates or pallets to be
treated with it to prevent pests from entering their countries.

Existing law requires manufacturers of pesticides to conduct health
effect studies and submit them to the state for evaluation.
Current law requires that the registration of methyl bromide be
suspended after March 30, 1996, if the necessary studies are not
submitted by then.

According to a recent study released by the Calif. Dept. of Food
and Agriculture (CDFA) the state could loose up to $346 million in
revenues and 9,894 full-time jobs annually, from the suspension of
methyl bromide registration.

Ongoing scientific debate between Cal/EPA and U.S. EPA regarding
how these studies should be conducted, delayed the initiation of
the studies.  Consequently, the last toxilogical study for methyl
bromide will not be completed until December 1997.

At the end of the last legislative session, SB 808 by Senator Dick
Monteith (R-Modesto) and Assemblyman Peter Frusetta (R-San Benito)
that would have resolved this problem, failed passage.  A special
session provides a practical way to extend the statutory deadline
for the submittal of the last methyl bromide study.  The special
session will run concurrently with the regular Legislative session.

At this time, in the Third Special Session, SB 1 (Henry Mellow, D-
Monterey),  SB 2 (Monteith) and AB 1 (Frusetta) have been
introduced.  Each bill would extend the methyl bromide study
deadline to December 1997.  Last week AB 1 passed the Assembly
Appropriation Committee (11-4).  It is currently scheduled for
hearing on the Assembly Floor.  SB 1 and SB 2 are scheduled for
hearing in the Senate Health and Human Services Committee on Jan.
24.  (For more information on these bills, see the California Bill
Report.)

Legislation passed during a special session go into effect on the
91st day after adjournment of the special session, while those
passed during a regular session of the Legislature go into effect
on January 1 of the following year.

WORKER PROTECTION STANDARD IMPLEMENTATION HEARINGS SCHEDULED

SACRAMENTO -- The Dept. of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) has scheduled
six workshop/hearings throughout the state on the implementation of
the federal Worker Protection Standard (WPS) in California.

Current California regulations place requirements on employers of
pesticide handlers and fieldworkers.  Currently the handler portion
of the regulations is applicable to all pesticide use situations:
the fieldworker portion is applicable to employees working in
treated agricultural fields; handler regulations cover protection
of study participants, hazard communication, emergency medical
care, training, personal protective equipment, decontamination
facilities, medical supervision, change areas, light, and closed
handling systems.  Fieldworker regulations encompass posting, and
reentry into, treated fields, training, emergency medical care,
decontamination facilities, and hazard communication.

By implementing the WPS in California, the coverage of both the
handler and fieldworkers of the WPS are limited to the commercial
or research production of agricultural plant commodities on farms,
forests, greenhouses, and nurseries.  Although the WPS addresses
most, but not all, of the same areas covered by current California
requirements.

The following hearings have been scheduled on Worker Protection
Standards:

Salinas - February 21

Salinas Community Center (Santa Lucia Room), 940 North Main St.,
Salinas, 93901.

Sacramento - February 26

Secretary of State Auditorium, 1500 - 11th St., Sacramento, 95814.

Visalia Area - February 28

UC Kearney Agriculture Center, 9240 South Riverbend Ave., Parlier,

ADDITIONAL COMMENT PERIOD FOR EXTENDED PESTICIDE USE

WASHINGTON -- Under the terms of a recent settlement agreement,
U.S. EPA will provide additional opportunity for public comment
before the Agency extends the time period during which "existing
stocks" of certain canceled pesticides can be used.

The settlement resolves a lawsuit brought by the United Farm
Workers of America (UFW) against EPA.  UFW sued the Government on
behalf of migrant workers who were exposed to the pesticide,
mevinphos, which was later canceled.  The workers learned that EPA
extended the period during which the manufacturer could continue to
sell "existing stocks" of the canceled pesticide.

Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act
(FIFRA), a manufacturer's registration of a pesticide can be
canceled if the pesticide poses an unreasonable health or
environmental threat.  In some cases, upon the request of a
manufacturer, EPA can permit the sale and use of existing stocks of
the canceled pesticides.

Through the settlement, EPA has agreed to go beyond the existing
terms of FIFRA, and provide public notice and an opportunity to
comment before it modifies the time period during which existing
stocks of certain canceled pesticides can be used.

"[This] settlement is part of EPA's ongoing efforts to increase
public involvement in the pesticide regulatory process," said Lynn
Goldman, EPA's Assistant Administrator for Prevention, Pesticides,
and Toxic Substances.

EPA is expected to publish its policy early this spring.

CROSS CONTAMINATION OF PESTICIDE PRODUCTS POLICY RELEASED

WASHINGTON -- Last month, a new policy that sets numerical limits
of contamination for all categories of pesticides, above which U.S.
EPA would consider the contaminant to toxicologically significant,
was released by the Agency.

In a notice issued to pesticide registrants (PR Notice 95-X), EPA
explained the Agency's new interpretation of what "toxicologically
significant" means in terms of contamination of pesticide active
ingredients, particularly as it pertains to the contamination of
one pesticide by another.  The new policy will allow EPA to focus
its attention on the contamination issues that pose a risk for
health and the environment.

According to the objectives in the PR notice, the new policy
should:

* set a clear standard that can be readily applied by the regulated
industry, as well as EPA;

* maintain accountability of the product form the producer to end
user;

* minimize the possibility that cross contamination will pose a
significant problem; and

* not preclude marketplace or private solutions to correct problems
that do arise.

Under the new policy, which goes into effect after a 60-day comment
period, EPA will move from a "zero-based" to a "risk based"
approach in considering the "toxicological significance" of
contamination of one pesticide by another.  Risk considerations
include potential human health effects from both dietary and non-
dietary exposure, ecological effects, potential groundwater
contamination and the potential for leaving unwanted residues on
food.

EPA has concluded that potential toxicity to plants by the
contaminant poses the greatest potential for harm, given the low
concentration of contamination being considered.

A contaminant that is toxicologically significant must be reported
to EPA for a determination of its potential effects and possible
corrective or regulatory action.

More Information

Copies of the new policy are available form EPA's Office of
Pesticide Communications, (703) 305-5017.

TWO PESTICIDES BANNED TO REDUCE POLLUTION IN BAY AND ESTUARIES

SACRAMENTO -- Emergency regulations to prohibit the sale and use of
pesticide products containing copper sulfate or tributyltin (TBT)
in nine Bay Area counties, have been announced by Cal/EPA.  Both
pesticides have been proven harmful to San Francisco Bay and its
estuaries.

The ban affects copper sulfate-containing pesticide products that
are poured into sewers and drains to kill plant and tree roots.
The affected TBT products are used in cooling towers in larger air
conditioning systems to control microorganisms that can cause
fouling.  The pesticides are prohibited for use in Alameda, Contra
Costs, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano,
and Sonoma counties.

Cal/EPA Secretary James Strock said, "Because we know that these
products have important uses, our scientists developed information
on alternative methods for controlling root intrusion in sewer
lines and microorganisms in many air conditioning systems.  This is
an excellent example of how environmental and economic progress can
be successfully combined."

UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANK LEAKAGE MAY BE LESS OF A THREAT

SACRAMENTO -- According to a recent study by Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory (LLNL), the impact of some leaking underground
storage tanks on the environment maybe less than previously
thought.

The independent study supports increasing evidence that many sites
within California present a low risk to the environment once the
tanks have been removed, and may require only monitoring to ensure
that the contaminated plume is stable and not contaminating other
areas.

In response to the study, recent state and public concern regarding
expensive regulatory oversight in the cleanup of leaking
underground fuel storage tanks, the State Water Resources Control
Board (SWRCB) has advised the state Regional Water Quality Control
Board and local oversight Programs to halt active remediation and
begin monitoring programs in cases containing low risk groundwater
exposure.  According to Cal/EPA, this will assure that State
attention is focused on better remediation of high risk sties and
situations.

Cal/EPA Secretary James Strock said, "This initial act by the Water
Board is among the first regulatory reforms resulting from Governor
Wilson's recent executive Order W-127-95.  We heard about the
urgency of this issue in our public forums in November, and now we
are taking action."

The report, "Recommendations to Improve the Cleanup Process for
California's Leaking Underground Fuel Tanks," was presented to the
SWRCB in October.  The report also recommends that passive
bioremediation be considered the primary remediation tool in most
cases, once the fuel leak source has been removed.

Typically, low risk cases involve shallow groundwater with a
maximum depth to water less than 50 feed and without drinking water
wells screened in the shallow groundwater zone with 250 feet of the
leak.

AIR

CPUC SETS UTILITY FUNDING LIMITS FOR LOW EMISSION VEHICLES -- The
Calif. Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has set the dollar amount
utilities can recover in rates to fund low emission vehicle (LEV)
programs for the next six years.  The combined utility LEV program
funding request totaled $426,652,000.  The CPUC approved
$171,421,000 (40 percent) of this amount.  Ratepayers will fund
$132,408,000.  Shareholders will fund the remainder.  The LEV
programs are intended to comply with Legislative mandate to
facilitate purchase and use of electric and natural gas vehicles in
California.

STUDY CONFIRMS HEALTH BENEFITS OF ACID RAIN REDUCTION -- A recent
study released by U.S. EPA estimates the value of health benefits
from the reduction of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from
utilities, under the acid rain provisions of the Clean Air Act
Amendments, at between $3 billion and $11 billion for 1997.  The
report focused on 31 eastern states where sulfates are a
substantial problem.
   It is estimated that by 2010, when the acid rain reduction
program will be fully implemented, the annual U.S. health benefits
will range between $12 billion and $40 billion.  According to the
report, reductions in premature deaths account for approximately 88
percent of the total health benefits; reductions in the number of
new cases of chronic bronchitis account for another nine percent of
the total.  More Information:  Copies of the study are available
from the Acid Rain Hotline, (202) 233-9620.

ELECTRIC VEHICLES

GOVERNOR COMMENDS GENERAL MOTORS ON VEHICLE DEBUT -- Governor Pete
Wilson has congratulated John Smith, Jr., chairman of the General
Motors (GM) Corporation, on the debut of the EV1, the first
purpose-built electric vehicle to be available to the public in
Southern California later this year.  "Making this revolutionary
vehicle available to the public will inevitably accelerate the
competition to produce zero emission vehicles, and will help us
reach California's mandate of having 10% of the automobiles for
sale be ZEVs [Zero Emission Vehicles] by 2003," the Governor said.
   GM introduced the EV1 on January 4.  The two-seat vehicle will
be marketed this fall.  The company has spent approximately $350
million on electric car development.

BILL INTRODUCTIONS

The following bills have been introduced since the last report.

Assembly Bills

AB 1983 (MILLER) CHLOROFLUOROCARBONS
   Existing law prohibits the prescribed manufacture or sale of
specified chlorofluorocarbons or aerosol propellants containing
a chlorofluorocarbon.  Existing law limits, as specified, the
sale of motor vehicles equipped with CFC-based products, and
requires motor vehicle manufacturers to submit specified
information in that regard to the State Air Resources Board.
   This bill would repeal those provisions.  The bill would
provide that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, a
person may possess, use, manufacture, purchase, install,
transport, or sell chlorofluorocarbons, and the possession, use,
manufacture, purchase, installation, transportation, or sale of
chlorofluorocarbons does not subject any person, this state, or
any political subdivision of this state to any penalty, fine,
retaliatory action, or other punitive measure.

STATUS: ASSEMBLY DESK
-----------------------------------------------------------------
AB 1996 (MARGETT) FREON: AIR-CONDITIONING
   Existing law prohibits the prescribed manufacture or sale of
specified chlorofluorocarbons or aerosol propellants containing
a chlorofluorocarbon.  Existing law limits, as specified, the
sale of motor vehicles equipped with CFC-based products, and
requires motor vehicle manufacturers to submit specified
information in that regard to the State Air Resources Board.
Existing federal law prohibits the production or use of certain
chlorofluorocarbons.
   This bill would provide that, notwithstanding any such
provision of law, until January 1, 2000, the production,
manufacture, use, and sale of freon for express use in
automotive and home air-conditioning units and home appliances
does not subject any person, this state, or any political
subdivision of this state to any penalty, fine, other punitive
measure, or enforcement action.
1/4/96 INTRODUCED
STATUS: ASSEMBLY DESK
-----------------------------------------------------------------
AB 2009 (CORTESE) WASTE: SOLID WASTE FACILITIES: PERMITS
   Existing law, the California Integrated Waste Management Act
of 1989, regulates the management of solid waste.  The act
requires the California Integrated Waste Management Board and
certified local enforcement agencies to perform specified
functions with regard to the regulation of solid waste
management, including the issuance and enforcement of solid
waste facilities permits.  The board is required to concur or
object to the issuance, modification, or revision of any solid
waste facilities permit within 60 days of the board's receipt of
any proposed solid waste facilities permit. However, the board
is required to object to the permit and to submit its
determination and specific objections to the local enforcement
agency, the applicant, and the city or county within which the
facility is located, until a countywide integrated waste
management plan has been approved by the board, if the board
makes a determination concerning specified diversion
requirements.
   This bill would delete that requirement that the board object
to the permit until the countywide integrated waste management
plan is approved.
   The bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately
as an urgency statute.

STATUS: ASSEMBLY DESK

Senate Bills

SB 1371 (MELLO) ECONOMIC POISONS
   Under the Birth Defect Prevention Act of 1984, the Department
of Food and Agriculture was required by December 31, 1985, to
identify pesticide active ingredients that the department
determined had the most significant data gaps and widespread use
and that were suspected to be hazardous to people.
   Under the act, the Director of Pesticide Regulation also was
required on January 15, 1992, to issue a notice of the impending
suspension of the registration of those pesticide products
containing an active ingredient with a significant data gap for
which the registrant had not submitted required data by December
31, 1991.
   However, existing law provides that notwithstanding these
provisions, if the director finds that delays in submitting the
mandatory health effects studies were primarily caused by
actions of the Department of Pesticide Regulation, the director,
with the concurrence of the Secretary for Environmental
Protection, may extend the deadlines for submitting the
mandatory health effects studies for certain ingredients,
including, among others, pentachlorophenol and methyl bromide.
   In addition, under the act, no pesticide product containing
specified active ingredients for which the required studies have
not been submitted by March 30, 1996, shall remain registered
in this state after that date.
   This bill would revise these latter provisions to specify, in
addition, that no pesticide product containing methyl bromide
or pentachlorophenol for which the required studies have not
been submitted by December 31, 1997, shall remain registered
after those respective dates.
   This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately
as an urgency statute.

SB 1385 (ROSENTHAL) PUBLIC CONTRACTS: STATE PURCHASING: RECYCLED
PRODUCTS
   Existing law requires all state agencies to purchase
rerefined automotive lubricants, recycled antifreeze, recycled
solvents, and recycled paints, as defined.  Existing law
requires the purchase of the listed materials only when they are
available, of a fitness and quality equal to their nonrecycled
product and are not more costly than 5% of the lowest price
quoted by suppliers.  Existing law would repeal on January 1,
1997.
   This bill would delete the repeal date of January 1, 1997,
thereby continuing the requirement that all state agencies
purchase the listed materials indefinitely.

CONVERGENCE

A senior official of the Austrian Environment Ministry raised an
intriguing question at the end of last year (this issue p5): will the
presence of the three new member states of the European Union, Austria,
Finland and Sweden, lead to future ecological criteria comparable to
the convergence criteria set as pre-conditions for economic and
monetary union (EMU)?  From one point of view, the notion of an
environmental equivalent to the EMU convergence criteria would be seen
by some Euro-sceptics as just another potty idea from Europhiles who
have lost contact with reality.  After all, the member states are
having enough difficulty getting their economies into line for EMU at
the moment, to the point where even Germany seems to be waivering on
the timetable.

On the other hand, the mere stating of such a thought tells us
something about the changing balance of power within the EU on
environmental policy.  The three new states which joined in 1995 have
added an important new block of votes within EU Council meetings on the
side of environmental rigour.  Their decisions to join the Union were
hard fought internally and were predicated upon a determination to
retain their own higher-than-EU environmental standards and an
understanding that other like-minded member states would help them to
raise the whole EU regulatory framework into line.  Each had to
overcome considerable doubts about the commitment of the EU to
environmental protection before they could persuade their populations
to support accession.

For a variety of reasons, including high disposable income, exposure to
imported pollution by air or water, vulnerable and highly prized
natural assets, and cultures insured in a certain brand of civic
responsibility, these countries had already gone beyond the existing EU
standards in a number of environmental fields.  There were others where
they had done less, but those received rather less publicity and, in
any case, the public in these countries does appear overall to be more
willing than their colleagues in some other EU states to support public
spending on environmental objectives.

In the course of the negotiations about their joining the EU, the three
new members secured a deal which allowed them to keep environmental
standards which exceeded EU requirements for up to four years while the
European Commission attempted to persuade the rest of the Union to
revise the common rules upwards.  The EU gave no binding commitment to
such upward revisions at the end of the four-year transition period;
what it agreed to was to try to achieve that and to convene a full
review of the standards at issue at the end of the period, giving the
new members a chance to participate in the review on an equal footing
with those which had arrived before but also obliging them to come into
line with whatever emerges.  The open-ended nature of this agreement
seems to have been somewhat glossed over within the three countries,
where the public has been assured that there is absolutely no way the
EU is going to force them to back down on their tight standards.

The governments involved, which had stuck their necks out politically
to support EU entry, have limited room for manoeuvre on this, because
the anti-EU campaigns made great play of the argument that their proud
national environmental standards would be undermined by EU membership.
Having now gone in, it is therefore imperative to prove them wrong by
showing that there has been no back-tracking and that, on the contrary,
the new members have helped to raise the level of protection throughout
the Union.

Because there is still some way to go before the transition period
expires, differing perceptions about what has been agreed can be safely
left alone for the time being, in the knowledge that, on some of the
critical issues, the previous member states had already accepted that
existing regulations were out of date.  Nevertheless, as the Inter-
Governmental Conference (IGC) to decide the next steps towards
integration of the EU approaches, environmental policy seems set to
play a greater part in the proceedings than ever before.  Some
observers even think that it could become a serious obstacle to further
progress, both among the existing fifteen members and in relation to
accepting new countries from central and east Europe (CEE).

Both the new entrants and several longer-standing members have an
agenda for the IGC meetings in Turin which amounts to a clear stepping
up of environmental regulation, including greater use of qualified
majority voting within Environment Council meetings and less recourse
to the principle of subsidiarity.  That principle, the same Austrian
official said, " should be interpreted restrictively and not in the
sense of impeding environmental policies at Community level .... In any
case," she went on "we should avoid a narrow-minded interpretation of
this important principle."

Although some items on these countries' agenda will be agreed all
round, other objectives on their lists will set them directly at odds
with less enthusiastic member states which either think that regulation
has gone far enough in a certain field or believe that it should be
left to national governments.  Perhaps more importantly, since the EU
is well accustomed to such internal struggles, the new strengthening of
the environmental harmonisation voice also risks worsening a potential
collision between existing EU members and the countries which hope to
be the next in line.  In particular, the countries of central and east
Europe (CEE) have high expectations of early EU accession and such
hopes are only increased by signs of political instability in Russia.
And yet, the task of approximating their environmental laws and
standards in a wide range of fields to those of the EU remains a
daunting one (this issue p7).

Estimates of the cost of this approximation process vary widely, with
figures like ECU100bn (US$78.6bn) or even ECU300bn quoted for the
region as a whole.  At the same time, the enormous environmental
problems faced by these countries remain somewhat side-lined by urgent
economic objectives, presenting the governments concerned with endless
reasons for postponing painful and expensive environmental reforms and
for restraining environmental enforcement.  Real progress is
undoubtedly being made and there is no shortage of people at all levels
who are determined to push through such reforms.  The problem is that
this is very difficult and there is no shortage of momentum for plenty
of other crying needs as well.

Amid this potentially awkward conflict between member states insisting
on an upward revision of EU standards and politically sensitive
aspiring members who have a huge task ahead just to get close to the
pre-conditions for entry, EU policy-makers are working hard to inject
more realism into the debate.  In doing so, they have to take on board
on both the ecological imperatives of countries like Austria, Sweden,
Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands, and the need for practical ways
forward in the CEE countries.

One fear is that this could all lead inexorably towards a split or even
a series of splits into two- or three-speed Europes, the implications
of which are distinctly uncomfortable for many people.  The danger is
that failure to reconcile these ill-matched goals could bring progress
towards CEE accessions to a halt and that such a setback would
undermine hard-won understandings among existing EU members.  In some
ways, it is hard to believe that environmental issues could play a
critical part in such weighty historical developments and, indeed, when
the crunch comes, they may be swept aside.  For the moment, however,
they seem likely to command a lot of attention.

GUIDANCE LIKELY IN THE SPRING

The guidance document due to elaborate on key contaminated land and
liability provisions in the Environment Act 1995 now seems likely to
emerge in draft for public comment around April (ELR028/3, 026/5, 025/3
et al).  No formal announcement has been made, but ELR understands that
a pre-publication draft is due to be circulated to selected experts and
interested groups in mid-February.  A meeting with a core group of
people has been arranged by the Department of the Environment (DoE) for
22 February, apparently to garner initial responses to that draft.  A
similar meeting was held in April 1995 at an earlier stage in the
policy debate to give the same people early warning of the Government's
then plans for guidance and amendments as the Environment Bill was
entering the House of Commons (ELR020/6).

Until recently, the main target date for the DoE has been to get the
package of guidance and regulations ready for submission to Parliament
before its summer recess.  Although ELR can only speculate at this
stage, it looks now as though that date could be hard to meet.  If a
public draft is put out for comment in April, there could be a
consultation period of about six to eight weeks, after which the
submissions will have to be digested and revisions made where
appropriate.  The DoE apparently kept open the option of seeking
further advice once the public responses were received from the
contractors it used at the end of last year (ELR026/5), although it may
not exercise that option.  The most likely date for a revised draft now
seems to be late-summer, early-autumn, perhaps October.  Hopefully,
that will go straight to Parliament for approval in a procedure that
can not take less than three weeks.  Some observers have suggested that
there might be a need for a further brief period for comment before
final submission to Parliament if substantial changes have been made in
the light of the responses in the spring.  The DoE will be hoping to
avoid that and, provided it does, the whole regime could come into
force around the beginning of 1997.

VENDORS & WASTE PRODUCERS AT RISK

The possible implications of the UK Government's new contaminated land
regime continue to be pored over in advance of the guidance documents
and regulations due out soon in draft to clarify important points in
Part II of the Environment Act 1995 (this issue above).  At a seminar
in London in January, convened by the Contaminated Land Working Party
of the UK Environmental Law Association, Richard Burnett-Hall, of
Bristows Cooke & Carpmael, London, warned that people selling
contaminated sites could be at risk of liability later on if the
purchaser or subsequent owners decided to change the site's use.  He
also argued that, although the UK Act does not name waste producers or
generators as primary responsible parties in the way that the US
Superfund law does, waste producers could nevertheless find themselves
drawn into the liability net as polluters.

Mr Burnett-Hall observed that a vendor who had warranted that a site
was clean for the purposes of a planned future use such as a car park
and had agreed a sale price with a purchaser under those conditions
might find that a subsequent change of use at the site re-opened the
question of responsibility for the remaining contaminants.  Under the
new regime, a site could be approved as satisfactory by the authorities
for the purposes of a specific intended use while a considerable amount
of residual contamination remained underground, contained against
further dispersion but neither removed nor eliminated.  That is the
core of the Government's "suitable for use" clean-up strategy, intended
to encourage the return to productive use of old industrial sites by
avoiding the excessive costs which would be incurred if all sites had
to be returned to a pristine condition.

Such partially cleaned sites would, however, be granted approval only
for restricted uses.  A plan to change their use to, say, a residential
development might cause them to be re-classified as contaminated and
trigger a whole new round of official remediation procedures.  At that
point, Mr Burnett-Hall told ELR, the regulator might deem the original
vendor an "appropriate person" for a remediation order or cost recovery
action on the grounds that he or she "caused" the offending substances
to be "in, on or under" the relevant land.  Unless the forthcoming
official guidance were specifically designed to avoid vendors being put
back on the hook once they had done what was required for the
originally intended use, he said, vendors would be well advised to seek
an indemnity from the purchaser covering all the contamination
remaining at the site.  Otherwise, the vendor's liability exposure
could remain open long after the site had passed out of his or her
control.

In relation to waste producers, Mr Burnett-Hall said that much would
depend on the meaning of "cause".  At present, there must be some
concern, he suggested, that a waste producer operating under the duty
of care imposed by the Environmental Protection Act 1990 might follow
his wastes all the way to a disposal site and even require that they be
deposited at a certain location within the site, remaining to check
that this was carried out, and then find later that the regulator
deemed such control to amount to causing contaminating substances to be
present in, on or under the land.  Again, Mr Burnett-Hall said that he
would like to see the guidance address this directly, specifying that
waste producers in such circumstances were not "appropriate persons".

Among other things, Mr Burnett-Hall also predicted that the forthcoming
guidance under the Act would be "seriously useful" compared with what
had existed hitherto and that the new land regime would be far more
effective in making things actually happen.  He said that it remained
open to question, however, how far local authorities would be competent
and willing to carry out the provisions, especially in relation people
operating in their areas.  He expected voluntary clean ups, where
operators chose to agree a plan with the regulators, often to go beyond
statutory requirements and not stop at just enough remedial action for
the next site use.  He also expressed concern about  the procedure for
apportioning liability, arguing that it would be difficult to define a
clear hierarchy of "appropriate persons" even in the guidance and that
one option would be to give local authorities discretion over whom to
name.  If that were adopted, he said, either there would be room for
appeal on the grounds that someone else should have been named as
responsible, in which case there was a risk of Superfund-style
litigation, or appeals would not be allowed and the process would be
seen as very unfair.

NEW MEMBERS WANT TOUGHER STANDARDS

With the approach of the 1996 Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC) to
decide the next steps towards integration of the European Union, no one
should be in any doubt that the arrival as EU members of Austria,
Finland and Sweden in 1995 has increased the pressure for tight
environmental regulation. Speakers from all three countries at a
conference in Vienna in November* emphasised the importance placed on
this by a broad cross-section of opinion in each and the overall effect
of this on the European Commission was confirmed by representatives of
the Commission's environment directorate general (DGXI).  To some
extent, this process has passed unnoticed in the rest of the EU up to
now, perhaps because of the low key role so far played by the new
members.

The IGC process may turn out to be the first widely visible platform
for this new pro-environment block, which is likely to support moves,
already backed by some existing member states, for more stringent
standards and greater use of qualified majority voting, rather than
unanimity, within the Council of Ministers on environmental matters.
Another opportunity will arise when an initial four-year transition
period for the new member states comes to an end.  During that period,
the accession treaty allows the new states to maintain standards which
are stricter than those within the rest of the EU and commits the
European Commission to conducting a review of EU standards in the hope
of raising them to the levels prevailing in the new states.  At the end
of the period, the intention is to have settled common standards across
all 15 member states, with the aim of setting them at the highest
possible level.

The new states clearly expect that to accommodate their own or higher
standards and are stating that, if such agreement has not been reached
by then, they will be very reluctant to reduce their standards into
line with those of less strict members.  The Commission, on the other
hand, is insisting that the accession treaty and the joint declarations
which went with it commit the EU only to a process of revision and not
to any definite result.  The new states will therefore have the chance
to press their case as full participants in an EU-wide discussion, but
the outcome can not be guaranteed.

Jose MartAEnez Aragon, of DGXI, told the conference nevertheless that
the arrival of the new member states had given new impetus to the EU's
environmental policy.  Among other things, it had allowed the EU to
take a more assertive position in international negotiations, such as
the Berlin climate change conference and the third meeting of the Basel
Convention (ELR025/8).  In an accompanying paper, Margaret Brusasco-
MacKenzie, the head of DGXI's international affairs unit, said that it
was already clear from the new states' role in recent environment
council meetings that their arrival, with a background of high
standards and high public awareness of environmental issues, would
"produce a Union with a far more ambitious approach".  When it comes to
the review under the transition arrangements, she said, "the question is
not whether the Union of fifteen can go hand-by- hand towards higher
standards, but rather the speed at which this is to be done."

Austria

Speakers at the conference* from Austria all stressed that
environmental concerns had figured high on the list of priorities
during the debate about joining the EU, with a majority of Austrians
concerned about any possible dilution of the country's stringent
regulations.  The agreement, known as the "horizontal solution", in the
accession treaty allowing Austria to maintain its own environmental
standards even where those exceed the EU equivalents, throughout the
four-year transition period, was seen as a key result of the
negotiations leading up to accession.  It is clear that the Austrian
Government, recently re-elected with a similar political complexion,
will fight hard at the end of that period to prevent any loosening of
standards and will lobby strongly for support in other member states .

Ingrid Thomasitz, of the Federal Environment Ministry, said that, in
the current review of the EU's Fifth Environmental Action Programme
(this issue p12), the Austrian Government would support a more robust
application of sustainability as a real test of policies in fields such
as transport, energy, agriculture and tourism, a restrictive
interpretation of subsidiarity so that it does not impede environmental
policies at EU level, and a further strengthening of the precautionary
and polluter pays principles, together with the integration of
environmental costs into the prices of goods and services.

At the 1996 Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC), she said that Austria
would advocate: an obligation on the Commission to consider the
environmental effects or "ecological consequences", as well as the
budgetary ones, of every legislative proposal; simplification and
revision of the safeguard clause in Article 100(a)(4) of the Treaty to
make it a real "environmental guarantee", allowing member states "to
introduce stricter national standards as well as apply the existing
ones"; wider support for qualified majority voting and the joint
decision-making procedure under Art 189(b) of the Treaty, to enable
measures such as energy taxes to be imposed, although with limits in
relation to certain policy fields; other reforms to strengthen the role
of the European Parliament in EU decision-making; and greater
transparency in decision-making to aid public involvement.

Overall, Ms Thomasitz speculated that the presence of the three new
member states might at some stage lead to ecological criteria
comparable to the convergence criteria for economic and monetary union.
 Klemens Fischer, of Austria's Permanent Representation to the EU in
Brussels, told the conference that the acknowledgment given in Joint
Declarations 6 and 7 of Act of Accession to the new member states'
attachment to their existing environmental standards had been very
important to the voting within Austria on joining the EU.  He warned
that, if the Union had not reached common standards equivalent to those
prevailing in Austria by the end of the four-year transition period,
Austria would see no alternative to exercising its right to impose
national standards under Art 100(a)(4)  and, he said, the political
stakes would be too high for the European Commission to prevent that.

Frank Ceska, General Secretary of the Federation of Austrian
Industrialists, observed that an important part of the case presented
by opponents of joining the EU had been that it would deprive Austria
of its ability to pursue an independent, and stricter, environmental
regime.  He made clear that Austrian industry had rejected that view
and was gratified that the critics had been proved wrong, since none of
the country's stricter regulations had been changed since EU entry.  He
also drew attention to a pledge given by EU Environment Commissioner
Ritt Bjerregaard at a Council meeting in March 1995, that she did not
intend that any of the new member countries should be forced to change
their standards after the end of the transition period.

Given Austria's commitment to tight environmental rules, Mr Ceska
reported that industry favoured accelerated harmonisation of stricter
rules throughout the EU, rather than development of new rules in
Austria alone. In particular, he called for postponement of current
Justice Ministry proposals for a new environmental liability act in
Austria, based on the Council of Europe convention on civil liability
for damage resulting from activities that are dangerous to the
environment (the "Lugano" Convention).  This, he argued, would cause
"an enormous burden for industry and an unbearable distortion of
competition".  It would be much better, he said, to await forthcoming
European Commission proposals for an EU directive in this field.

Paul Luiki, of Heller, Lober, Bahn & Partners, Vienna, explained that
Austria had good reasons for sensitivity to environmental damage: it is
a small, land-locked country bordering on eight other countries, which
imports over 90% of its air pollution and a good deal of water
pollution through rivers such as the Danube, depends on groundwater for
99% of its drinking water, has an important tourist industry which
requires a clean environment and also poses risks to it, and has a
particular problem with ground-level ozone, with substantially higher
concentrations than elsewhere in Europe.  As a result, he said,
according to a 1991 OECD study Austria devoted a higher percentage of
its GDP to environmental protection, at 1.94%, than most other
industrialised countries, including Germany (1.74%), the Netherlands
(1.46%) and the US (1.36%).

Mr Luiki cautioned that comparisons of Austrian and EU environmental
standards could be over-simplified, since in some cases these were not
defined in comparable ways, and like Mr Ceska, he pointed to some areas
where EU membership had led Austria to introduce new rules, such as
environmental impact assessment and access to environmental
information.  He also noted that, in some fields such as wastewater
discharges, implementation of stricter Austrian standards left room for
improvement.  On the other hand, he said that Austria had given greater
priority than the EU to groundwater quality within its drinking water
policy.  A regulation under the country's Water Act, he told the
conference, required provincial governors to declare a groundwater
action area and to implement clean-up action where quality criteria
were exceeded.  He reported that the first such action was still
awaited, but he did not think it would be long before one occurred.  He
also pointed to associated regulations on storage of hazardous
materials, including one covering chlorinated solvents which involved
stringent emission and monitoring standards and for which there was as
yet no EU equivalent.

Ernst Brandl, of Schonherr Barfuss Torggler & Partner, Vienna,
highlighted the heavy reliance under Austrian law on "command and
control" mechanisms, at both federal and provincial levels.  Lengthy
permitting procedures, he said, usually allow everyone who might be
affected by a proposed development to participate and to appeal, with
the result that, for example, 12,000 people were involved in the
certification process of a garbage incineration plant in Vienna.  Most
provinces also have an "attorney for the environment" who has standing
in all provincial proceedings concerning activities which might have an
impact on the environment.

Finland/Sweden

Satu Nurmi, of the Finnish Permanent Representation to the EU, told the
conference* that Finland's geography presented special environmental
risks, with one-third of its territory above the Arctic Circle, a harsh
northern climate and natural resources which were vulnerable to
chemical precipitation.  "Even a small input of a hazardous substance,"
he said, "may cause impacts that are difficult if not impossible to
remedy simply because the natural renovation capacity of ecosystems is
very slow in northern latitudes."  He then listed a series of subjects
on which Finland had obtained special declarations and transitional
arrangements during the EU accession process, where it considered
present EU regulations insufficiently strict.  These included
transitional measures covering: pentachlorophenols (PCPs), fertilisers,
pesticides, sulphur content of liquid fuels and plant protection
products.

Like the Austrian speakers (this issue above), Mr Nurmi emphasised that
such environmental issues were given a high priority by the Finnish
public.  That was also echoed by Prof Hans Stenberg, of Advokatfirman
Lindahl, Stockholm, who said that this was one area in which the
Swedish Government could find common ground with a large part of the
Swedish population, the political parties and non-governmental
organisations (NGOs).  He reported that the Government had specified as
priorities in its approach to the EU's environmental agenda: measures
to combat acidification and climate change, resource management and
product recycling, conservation of biological diversity, more stringent
chemical control, international co-operation and more specific measures
including: environmental impact assessments, cleaner industrial
processes, waste disposal, environmental management and audits, trade,
energy-related taxes and land and water resource management.

More generally, Prof Stenberg said that the Swedish Government attached
much importance to implementation of rules once they were agreed.  That
went further than the basic question of correct implementation of
directives under member state law, he said; it also included allocation
of enough economic resources to the responsible bodies to ensure that
the rules are effectively observed.

LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE ACCESSION

Environmental issues could become a major obstacle to accession to the
European Union for the first time as the countries of central and east
Europe (CEE) prepare for this step following agreement on a broad pre-
accession strategy at the Essen European Council in December 1994.
Despite much rhetoric and optimism up to now, they still have a very
long way to go before they fulfil the environmental policy conditions
required for entry, according to a representative of the European
Commission.  Speaking at a conference in Vienna in November(this issue
above), Julian Wilson, of the PHARE Programme staff in DGIA, said that
while the Commission was working hard to support the countries' efforts
towards accession, there were some unrealistic expectations within the
CEE region, particularly in relation to the environmental conditions.
Among the problems experienced so far, he reported, were that the
dialogue with the EU on the issues involved was relatively superficial,
basic information and statistics were lacking, as were comprehensive
country strategies, financing plans and schedules did not exist,
legislation was being passed but not monitored or enforced, and the
environment was generally of secondary importance compared with
economic growth.

He warned that existing member states would not allow new entrants
unless the statutory targets on matters such as emissions were met and
the CEE region was mostly still a long way off that.  The European
Commission's environmental policy representatives were often seen as an
irritating obstacle by CEE government ministries, such as finance and
industry, he said, some of whom had to be convinced that environmental
requirements were unavoidable.  Mr Wilson described the progress which
had been made since the publication last summer of a White Paper on
preparation for integration into the internal market (COM(95) 163
final), on matters such as harmonisation of regulations, monitoring and
enforcement, municipalities, and past environmental damage and the
greening of industry.  He emphasised that the funds available through
the PHARE Programme and other international financial institutions
would amount to only a small proportion of the money required by the
CEE countries for approximation to EU environmental standards.

Mr Wilson made a number of forecasts on how things would develop in the
next few years, including that: CEE industry would remain uncontrolled
and very "ungreen" during the accession period; municipalities would
meet environmental conditions faster; the environment overall would
become a block to creation of a free market and to eventual accession;
the central part of the region had a head start, although the Baltic
states were catching up fast; the countries which costed the
environment fully, enforced more strongly and asked for acceptable
dispensations would accede first; and the present timeframes were
completely crazy.  The idea being promoted by some that the countries
would meet the objectives within five years was nonsense, he said;
progress could be made, however, if governments were prepared to
discuss specific derogations and enforcement matters.  The whole debate
in the environmental field, he argued, needed to be much more
structured, operational and realistic.  He also warned that this
process presented real dangers if it was not taken sufficiently
seriously, because a failure to achieve the EU's objectives in relation
to CEE countries could rebound on what had been achieved within the
existing EU membership.

Tim Murphy, head of the environmental appraisal unit at the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), London, also urged
sober assessment of the amounts of money needed to achieve
harmonisation with EU standards, pointing out that one estimate for all
six accession countries and three Baltic states was ECU100bn, or 3.6%
of gross domestic product (GDP) a year.  Another estimate given earlier
at the conference, of ECU300bn, would represent some 11% of GDP on
environmental affairs, he pointed out, which was clearly unrealistic.
He stressed that most of the finance for achieving environmentally
sustainable development would have to come from the countries
themselves and much of it from the private or municipal sectors.

Among the challenges facing the CEE countries, Mr Murphy said, were a
need to realise that they had to internalise environmental costs, a
need to embrace principles such as cleaner production and waste
minimisation, and the importance of environmental product standards.
He argued that it was particularly important to the EBRD that the
countries did not divide into two, with an advanced minority having
prospects of early accession and a less advanced majority falling
behind.  He also said that the investment cycle currently offered a
window of opportunity which had to be seized by the countries
themselves.

Gyula Bandi, of University Eotvos Lorand, Budapest, said that the
environment was still not a high priority issue for the Hungarian
Government, although he hoped that the introduction of Hungary's new
Environmental Protection Act (in force from December 1995) (ELR023/5,
020/7) might push it up the priority list.  Even the Act, he argued,
tended to allow economic considerations to override environmental
requirements, with concepts such as "if the present economic situation
allows" and a general lack of acceptance that there would be costs to
industry.  A key problem, he said, was there was still no core
programme or strategy, within which to order priorities and, in
addition, a recent resolution to restructure government
responsibilities had created uncertainty about who the competent
authorities for various environmental matters would be.

Stanislaw Wajda, an adviser to the Polish Environment Minister,
reported that the Polish Government was working on a framework law
which was launched in June last year, was due to be completed by June
1996 and should be sent to the country's Parliament by the end of 1997.
 He said that Poland faced problems such as a lack of legal expertise
and of analytical materials on EU laws, and was missing working
relations with EU experts and direct insight into the legislative
process within the EU.  He felt that observer status would be helpful
and he drew attention to a refusal of such status which had occurred in
1994 when Poland approached the EU's network of enforcement officials,
known as the Chester or IMPEL Network (ELR006/15, 005/15, 001/9). At
the time, the response had been that the request was premature, but he
argued that that ought to be re-considered.

EMERGING FROM SOVIET RULE

An important feature of the development of environmental law in the
Baltic states is that, unlike the countries of central Europe, they are
emerging from 50 years within the Soviet Union.  They have therefore
had to develop a whole framework of national law, as well as rules for
a market economy, since they obtained independence in 1991.  They
reached approximation agreements with the EU in 1995, so are very much
at the beginning of the process of adjusting their environmental laws
and regulations, the conference (this issue p7) was told by Gretta
Goldenman, of Oppenheimer Wolff & Donnelly, Brussels.

In Lithuania, she reported, a unit has been set up within the Ministry
of Environmental Protection to deal with the approximation process, but
the Ministry has access to very little expertise in environmental law
and would benefit greatly from closer contact with experts in more
advanced countries.  For that reason, she said, the Lithuanian
Government has recently been exploring close working ties with one or
more EU member states, to learn from their experience.  In the
meantime, a substantial amount of legislation is in draft, covering
subjects like environmental impact assessment and waste management, and
a framework law on environmental protection was passed in 1992.  An
environmental strategy was also recently prepared for submission to the
Sofia Environment for Europe conference last October (ELR025/6).

Legislators were having to struggle in this field, Ms Goldenman said,
with a background of Soviet regulations on subjects like ambient air
and water quality, which were so strict that they were virtually
unachievable.  The result in the past, she said, was that statutory
"maximum allowable pollution values" were routinely supplemented by
"temporary allowable pollution limits" issued by the authorities to
reflect what was actually being released by a plant.  Charges and
penalties for pollution were consequently very low, leaving almost no
incentive at all for enterprises to invest in pollution reduction.

One of the anomalies in Lithuania, and also in Latvia and Estonia, has
been that the privatisation process has up to now involved selling
enterprises separately from the land on which they stand, Ms Goldenman
told ELR.  This is because the country's Constitution limits ownership
of land to citizens of Lithuania and foreign embassies.  In order to
become members of the EU this has to be changed, she said, and a
Constitutional amendment partially removing that obstacle was being
debated in the Lithuanian Parliament in December.  An inter-ministerial
working group set up in April 1995, with some outside representation
from the business community, she reported, also produced
recommendations in September concerning liability issues in the
privatisation process, focussing particularly on damage which occurred
prior to privatisation, when the assets were under state ownership.
The Environmental Protection Ministry is currently considering those
recommendations.

WASTE OFFENCES BRING NEW LAW

A series of breaches of waste management authorisations recently
uncovered by environmental inspectors have persuaded the Slovak
Environment Ministry (MZPSR) to introduce new measures to tighten up
regulation in this field. The Ministry is currently preparing a new Law
on Wastes, part of which will include provisions to make it much more
difficult to "skirt round" the laws and regulations, according to a
statement from Environment Minister Josef Zlocha in January.  There
will also be encouragement for waste incineration as preferable to some
other forms of waste disposal.  Mr Zlocha emphasised that the danger
from wastes should not be under-estimated, because in the future they
could become an "ecological time bomb".

Two cases were cited by the Slovak News Agency in January.  The first
concerned a company called EHS, part of Slovnaft as, which had assumed
responsibility for handling certain hazardous wastes.  Instead of
disposing of them in the approved manner, the Ministry discovered
17,000 tonnes (t) of the waste in a brickworks yard in Lucenec, near
the Hungarian border, and 7,000t at a municipal waste site in Trencin,
north east of Bratislava. The second case involved Tellus Tellumo, in
Bratislava, which is alleged to have discharged used mineral oil
without due regard to its effects on groundwater and to have been
storing used batteries on site, with possible sulphuric acid leaks.
The company had a licence only to transport, rather than store, such
materials.  Local and national inspection officials were reported to
have exercised the appropriate sanctions in both cases.

PARLIAMENT RATIFIES BASEL

Bulgaria was added to the list of countries which have ratified the
Basel Convention on trans-boundary movements of hazardous wastes and
their disposal, following a vote in its Parliament on 18 January.  In
supporting the vote, the Government observed that Bulgarian law in
recent years had been brought into line with the provisions of the
Convention.  The Environmental Protection Act passed in 1991 and
amended in 1992 regulates import and trans-shipment of waste, and is
backed up by foreign trade rules and agreements with the European
Union.  Bulgaria has also instituted an internal system for licensing
hazardous waste disposal.  The Environment Ministry reported that
Bulgarian industry generated 14,300 tonnes of hazardous waste in 1994.

BC PUBLISHES THIRD SITE DRAFT

Draft no 3 of the Contaminated Sites Regulation for the Canadian
province of British Columbia (BC) was finally published on 4 December.
This Regulation is required in order to implement a new contaminated
site regime under the Waste Management Amendment Act, 1993 (also known
as Bill 26), which was passed in June 1993 (ELR001/6).  The regime
involves strict, joint and several, and retroactive liability,
compulsory remediation orders, with exemptions for certain parties,
limited liability provisions for minor contributors and those
volunteering to conduct clean ups, allocation panels to assist in
apportioning liability, a public registry of site information and site
profile requirements at the time of specified transactions.  The system
has been criticised by some business groups, but has also been subject
to prolonged consultation.  The BC Government's view is that the new
provisions clarify issues which were left unresolved under previous
legislation and in so doing provide more defences and exemptions for
the parties likely to be involved.

Draft no 2 of the Regulation was circulated for comment in September
1994, following a consultation exercise, originally with the intention
that it should be the final draft prior to implementation and therefore
subject only to minor changes.  By October 1994, however, further
consultation had been extended indefinitely following pressure from
municipal authorities and subsequently other groups concerning clean-up
standards, municipal liability and liability exposures for parties such
as lenders, trustees, developers and the mining industry (ELR014/6,
012/4).  The third draft appeared to be imminent in July 1995
(ELR024/5, 022/6), but has ultimately taken until December to come out.
 This time comments were requested within seven weeks (by 22 January)
and the BC Government appeared to be resolved finally to push the
Regulation through.  The target date for its coming into force was
given as spring 1996.

The Regulation now contains some 17 Divisions (chapters) covering
subjects such as site profiles, site registry, fees, contaminated site
definition and determination, remediation standards, liability,
contaminated soil relocation, remediation plan approval and completion,
and orphan sites.  Most of the changes reflect the concerns which were
expressed about the second draft by various interested groups, so that
municipalities in particular get a series of clarifications or
concessions reducing their liability exposures, new exemptions are
provided for trustees, executors, administrators and other fiduciaries,
a lower standard of care for receivers and a new system of soil
standard setting is introduced containing four different types of
standards which are intended to allow more flexibility in the
remediation process.

REPORT HOLDS OMAI LIABLE FOR DAM

An inquiry report produced by a commission of the Guyanese Government
has suggested that the mine operators, Omai Gold Mines Ltd, should be
held liable for the damage which resulted from the failure of a
tailings dam at Guyana's largest gold mine in August last year
(ELR025/9, 024/19). The report concluded that the company had a legal
obligation to ensure that the cyanide-contaminated water in the
tailings pond did not escape and would be liable, irrespective of the
quality of their work in securing it, if the contaminants were allowed
to escape.  On the other hand, the report decided that the
contamination of the Omai and Essequibo rivers caused by the incident
did not give rise to a serious threat to life and that the natural
bacteriological and biochemical systems in the water courses did not
seem to have been severely affected.

In the underlying event, some 3m cubic metres of cyanide-contaminated
waste escaped from the tailings pond at Omai mine, first into the local
Omai river, but thereafter into Guyana's largest river, the Essequibo.
Initial concerns included possible threats to loggers, native Indians,
fish and wildlife along the river, which is much used for drinking
water and fishing.  Some neighbouring Caribbean countries at one stage
imposed bans on Guyana's fish and shrimp catch.  By mid-September,
however, the Guyanese Health Ministry had declared the Essequibo safe,
following international inspections.  Local inhabitants, nevertheless,
are reported to have complained of skin irritations and a coalition
group critical of the commission's report has been considering a class
action lawsuit, according to the Montreal Gazette.

Omai Gold Mines Ltd is 65% owned by Cambior Inc, Montreal, 30% by
Golden Star Resources Ltd, Edmonton (part of a Colorado-based US group)
and 5% by the Guyanese Government.  The mine is reportedly the largest
open pit gold mine in South America.  At the beginning of January,
Finance Minister Bharrat Jagdeo reported that the country's gold export
earnings were US$27m short of their $135m target in 1995 because of the
Omai mine's closure following the spill.  A separate estimate put
Omai's losses, in terms of expenses and lost revenue, at C$25m
(US$18.2m).  Cambior's share price also fell substantially following
the incident, with investors noting that the Omai mine had been due to
account for a sizeable part of the company's gold production in 1995.

The commission called for independent geo-technical scrutiny of a new
impoundment under construction at the mine, to confirm its structural
integrity.  It suggested that the spill was caused by faulty
construction of an embankment dam holding the liquid waste, resulting
in progressive cavities or tunnels in the core of the embankment which
ended in catastrophic failure.  Its report did not attempt to apportion
blame for the faults.

PARLIAMENT PRESSES FOR LIABILITY DIRECTIVE

Just when some observers thought that DGXI's efforts to get a draft
directive on environmental liability on to the books in 1996 were
running into difficulty (ELR028/9), the European Parliament has stepped
in to add a potentially important voice to the calls for such a
proposal.  At its plenary meeting in December, the Parliament approved
a resolution on the Commission's work programme for 1996 which includes
a demand that "a proposal for a directive concerning rules on damage to
the environment" be added to the programme.  When the 1996 work
programme was published in November, there was no mention of such an
initiative despite several indications during 1995 that DGXI hoped to
achieve this, if possible, in the early months of this year.

Efforts by DGXI to get approval for such a step from the College of
Commissioners, the forum which brings together all the European
Commissioners, at one of their meetings in December, were abandoned by
the middle of that month, apparently because the Environment
Commissioner, Ritt Bjerregaard, felt that the prospects of winning
agreement from her fellow Commissioners would be better after the
results were in from the two research projects into aspects of
environmental liability which are due for completion soon (ELR024/9,
022/8 et al).

What gives the Parliament's resolution some bite is that it draws
attention to its own previous resolution in April 1994 (ELR00/), which
called upon the Commission to bring forward proposals in this field,
and to the fact that the earlier resolution was passed by the
Parliament under Article 138b of the Treaty, which gives the Parliament
the power to initiate measures, rather than simply respond to the
Council and the Commission.  A separate clause in the December
resolution stresses that "the legislative programme should include
European Parliament initiatives adopted pursuant to Article 138b of the
EC Treaty".  The issue of environmental liability, whatever its
political complications, has therefore become embroiled in the
Parliament's battle to implement the enhanced powers it obtained under
the Maastricht treaty.  Other environmental measures mentioned in the
Parliament's December resolution included a proposal for "a directive
on soil protection laying down strict provisions on protection against
pollution and sustainable management of the soil (land use, erosion,
compaction)" and a "White Paper on the monitoring and application of
Community legislation on the environment, including the imposition of
penalties".

4TH INTERNATIONAL ENFORCEMENT CONFERENCE

The fourth in an increasingly important series of international
conferences on environmental compliance and enforcement will take place
on 22-26 April in Chiang Mai, Thailand.  Over 200 participants have
registered for this event, representing some 80 countries and
international organisations.  The previous conference was held in
Oaxaca, Mexico, in April 1994, attracting 175 people from 70 countries
(ELR012/8-11, 011/14, 006/15), and before that the first two in the
series took place in Utrecht, in May 1990, and Budapest, in September
1992 (ELR001/10).  Those two brought together representatives from 13
and 40 countries, respectively.  The series has been supported
throughout by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the
Dutch Environment Ministry (VROM), together latterly with the UN
Environment Programme (UNEP), local agencies in the countries visited
and other groups.  There has been a deliberate attempt to spread the
activity geographically by convening each conference in a new region to
attract greater participation from that part of the world.

What distinguishes these mega-events from some other conferences is
that participation is confined for the most part to active national and
local officials with enforcement responsibilities, with a minority from
international agencies and non-governmental organisations (NGOs).  The
flavour of the get-together is therefore very much about action and
building enforcement capabilities by sharing experience and extending
support across national boundaries.  In that sense, within Europe it is
parallelled by the, also increasingly important, Chester or IMPEL
Network, which brings together enforcement officials throughout the EU
on a regular basis (ELR006/15, 005/15, 001/9).

The conference programme in Chiang Mai includes workshop sessions with
subjects which give an indication of some of the current priorities.
They include, among others: establishing international co-operation and
regional networks, automation and enforcement, strategic targeting,
compliance monitoring, promoting voluntary compliance, measures of
success, public role in enforcement, criminal enforcement (Interpol
etc), economic instruments, take-back laws, transboundary illegal
shipments of hazardous waste (tricks of the trade) and collaborative
international targeting. While much of the work will focus on
institutional, technical and policy issues, it is worth noting that
involving the public in helping to enforce environmental regulations
remains very much on the agenda.  Workshop sessions on this public role
will include issues such as the role of citizens in identifying
violators, their role in pursuing enforcement actions or forcing
governments to pursue violators and the need for public disclosure of
compliance information.  Alongside this, considerable effort will be
put into assisting countries with less advanced environmental
regulatory capacities to increase their effectiveness.

EEA HIGHLIGHTS SOIL & GROUNDWATER

Soil and groundwater problems were among the topics highlighted by the
European Environment Agency (EEA) in a report published in November as
part of the European Commission's review of its Fifth Environmental
Action Programme.  The report was published just before the EEA
celebrated its second anniversary at its Copenhagen headquarters, an
occasion marked by a ceremony attended by 140 people, including the
Commission President Jacques Santer, Environment Commissioner Ritt
Bjerregaard and senior representatives from all 15 EU member states.

The EEA report concluded that EU environmental policy needed to be
"accelerated" in order to meet its own environmental objectives.
Although progress had been made in reducing some pressures on the
environment, these were not enough, it said, to improve the general
quality of the environment, even less to achieve sustainability.
Successes in recent years had been mainly in dealing with point (ie
stationary) sources of pollution, especially in the industrial sector.
Policies aimed at diffuse sources, such as products, consumers and
transport, it argued, had been much less effective.

The report recommended that further attention be given at European
level to climate change, acidification, urban air quality, water
abstraction and groundwater quality, habitat destruction and
fragmentation, and waste management.  It also identified as other
issues which had not been comprehensively tackled at European level the
degradation of soil quality (described as an important natural
resource), coastal management and chemicals in the environment.  Within
the 151-page report, the EEA suggested that more attention should be
given to the efficiency of environmental policies and called for a
particular focus on the transport sector, where it foresaw exceptional
pressures on the environment as a result of growth trends in freight
and passenger road transport.

Mr Santer told the Agency's anniversary gathering that he wanted the
Commission to be "at the leading edge of environmental policies" and
that he saw the EEA's work in developing accurate data on environmental
trends as part of a drive to change attitudes across Europe.  Ms
Bjerregaard said that the issues identified in the EEA report would be
taken up in the Commission's own proposals for advancing the 5th Action
Programme.  She drew attention to the fact that moves towards greater
use of economic instruments in this field were being hampered by the
requirement for unanimity at the Council of Ministers on policies with
fiscal provisions and she observed that the unanimity requirement might
be reconsidered during the 1996 Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC)
(this issue p4).

EEA INTERNET SITE LAUNCHED

A European Environment Agency (EEA) Internet site was launched by
European Commission President Jacques Santer at the Agency's second
anniversary celebrations on 13 November.  The World Wide Web site, at
http://www.eea.dk/, is intended to play a key role in making EEA
information available to the general public.  The initial contents will
be relatively limited, but there are plans to add more publications and
many EEA databases, with the newest items advertised at the main home
page of the site.  Within the first month after its launch, the EEA
reported that there had been 1,800 accesses to the home page and a
total of over 30,000 file retrievals from the whole site.

REFINERY FINED RECORD S$150,000

A S$150,000 (US$105,783) fine imposed by the Port of Singapore
Authority against the Singapore Refinery Co in connection with an oil
spill at its Pulau Merlimau refinery last August is the highest so far
imposed in Singapore for an oil spill.  The penalty was imposed under
the Prevention of Pollution at Sea Act, which provides for fines up to
S$500,000 and prison terms of up to two years.  Previously, the highest
fine for this kind of incident had been S$30,000.

The August spill is reported to have resulted from a pipeline valve
being accidentally left open following maintenance activities.  Some
300 tonnes of oil subsequently leaked into the sea when pumping
restarted.  The oil apparently leaked into an adjoining drain and
thence into the storm water system and the sea.  It then spread over an
area of approximately 60 sq km and is said to have cost S$1.7m to clean
up.  A further S$6,000 in fines had previously been levied under the
Trade Effluents Regulations.

The company, a joint venture involving Caltex, BP and Singapore
Petroleum Ltd, had sought a lesser penalty on the grounds that it had
co-operated fully once the leak was detected and had done its utmost to
clean up the damage.  Since the incident, it told The Straits Times, it
had revised operating procedures, improved storm water inspection
before it enters the sea, installed guard basins and oil detection
devices, provided additional training for staff, and reviewed emergency
response systems, organising an external audit to verify the
improvements.  A spokesman told the paper that the company was ISO
certified and had worked quickly to implement all the recommendations
of the inquiries conducted after the spill.

NEW EPA AUDITING/SELF-REPORTING POLICY

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued a new policy
concerning environmental auditing and reporting of statutory
violations, which offers some incentives to companies to report
themselves when they discover such infractions, but also leaves
question marks about the advisability of doing so.  The policy
statement, "Incentives for Self- Policing: Discovery, Disclosure,
Correction and Prevention of Violations", was published in the Federal
Register on 22 December and came into effect on 22 January.  It is the
culmination of a period of consultation about this subject which began
in the summer of 1994 (ELR020/11, 013/11).

Hitherto, official guidance has been based on a series of policy
statements issued by the EPA and the Department of Justice from 1986
onwards, which stated that the regulators would not routinely seek
companies' audit reports in the course of their enforcement work and
that activities such as self-auditing and voluntary disclosure would be
taken into account in decisions about prosecutions and penalties.  The
underlying policy, however, reserved for the authorities the discretion
to demand such reports when they deemed it appropriate and was the
subject of much corporate concern because of the uncertainty which this
caused.

In recent years, business groups have been arguing in favour of a new
form of legal privilege to protect such internal review documents,
widely known as the "self-evaluative" privilege.  Several US states
have introduced such a concept at state level and there is case law
supporting it in private civil actions relating to fields such as
medical malpractice, but it is not recognised so far in the federal, or
many of the state, courts in the context of environmental actions.  The
EPA announced in March 1995 that it would not support a new statutory
audit privilege in this field, for fear that that could "promote
secrecy, expand litigation and compromise enforcement actions".  During
the consultation process, environmental groups had lobbied the Agency
for total transparency of the audit process, with public participation
and disclosure throughout.  Companies, in contrast, tend to feel that
more is achieved in terms of environmental protection if audit reports
remain internal.

What the EPA decided to offer instead was a policy of reduced civil
penalties and waiving of criminal proceedings where organisations
disclosed their own violations and promptly corrected them.  The
discretion to ask for audit material would remain, but would only be
exercised where there was independent evidence of a potential
violation.  The incentive system now coming into effect specifies
conditions under which the "gravity-based" component of a civil penalty
can be reduced by either 100% or 75%.  Such civil penalties are
assessed in two parts: first, in terms of the net economic benefit
which the company concerned is deemed to have gained as a result of
violating certain regulations and, second, a "gravity-based" element
intended to reflect the degree of seriousness involved.  The first will
continue to be imposed in full under the new policy, but the second may
be reduced or eliminated where companies meet specified standards.

A recent briefing put out by the Washington DC office of lawyers
Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, gives a good summary of the new policy's
provisions.  To secure a 100% reduction of the gravity-based penalty,
nine conditions have to be met: the violation must be discovered
through an environmental audit or "due diligence" compliance programme;
it must be identified voluntarily; it must be fully disclosed to the
EPA within 10 days of discovery; it must be discovered and disclosed
independent of any government, third party or "whistleblower" action;
it must be corrected within 60 days, or longer with EPA agreement, with
correction certified to the EPA; the company must agree to take steps
to prevent a recurrence; the violation must not be a repeat of a
previous violation; it must not have caused "serious actual harm" nor
presented "an imminent and substantial endangerment" nor violated the
terms of a previous order or consent decree; and the company must co-
operate with the EPA's investigation of the matter.  Morgan, Lewis &
Bockius point out that this will allow companies to benefit from the
penalty reduction even where the violation is of a kind that is subject
to mandatory reporting.

The policy then gives a detailed definition of environmental due
diligence sufficient to achieve the reduction, based on the company's
systematic efforts, appropriate to the size of the business, to
prevent, detect and correct violations through all of a six-point list
of measures.  It also offers more limited 75% reductions where the
company does not have an audit or due diligence programme meeting the
EPA criteria, but fulfils all the other conditions on the nine-point
list.

Alex Karlin, of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, told ELR that the EPA was
effectively offering companies a carrot to encourage voluntary
disclosure where no mandatory duty to disclose existed.  He cautioned,
however, that companies would have to look carefully at each case and
decide whether it was better to come forward and accept a high
probability of a penalty, albeit reduced, or not to report in the
knowledge that no one might ever find out or, if they did some years in
the future, the problem would already have been fixed.  Under the
latter circumstances, he said, the only thing missing would have been a
voluntary report to the authorities, who might by that time take the
view that it was not worth re-opening penalty proceedings.  The
decision, he suggested, would be fact-specific, based on the nature of
the violation and the likelihood of it coming out anyway.

The most important pre-requisite, Mr Karlin emphasised, was to fix the
problem immediately or as soon as possible.  Having done that, he
argued, the self-reporting question would become a smaller issue.  He
noted, nevertheless, that the "gravity-based" element in a penalty
assessed by the EPA could be as large as $1.4m or $2m, so the
reductions on offer could not be dismissed.  He also said that existing
company audit or compliance programmes ought now to be checked against
the new EPA definitions to make sure that they would qualify for
reductions under the scheme.

ACCOUNTING FORUM ADVISES ON REPORTING

Pressure for fuller reporting of environmental factors by companies
received a further boost in December, when a potentially influential
advisory document on the best ways to treat environmental expenditures
and liabilities in company accounts and annual reports within the
European Union was produced by an expert body known as the Accounting
Advisory Forum.  The Forum comprises individual experts selected on a
personal basis to advise the European Commission on accountancy
matters.  It is not a standard-setting body.  The document, entitled
"Environmental Issues in Financial Reporting", is therefore intended to
stimulate discussion on the issues among "standard-setters, preparers,
users and auditors of accounts" in member states.

The subject was raised in the Commission's Fifth Environmental Action
Programme, "Towards Sustainability", published in 1992, and the Forum
was asked by the Commission to give an opinion on how to improve
reporting in this field, "so that a better insight is provided into the
company's attitude towards the environment and the impact of
environmental risks and liabilities on its financial position."  The
document is not concerned with separate environmental reports produced
by companies, except insofar as it recommends that the existence of
these should be referred to in accounts and annual reports as a source
of further information.

Using the framework of general provisions in the 4th and 7th Company
Law Directives on annual and consolidated accounts (78/660/EEC and
83/349/EEC), the document acknowledges that environmental liabilities
and risks entail special uncertainties relating to factors such as
changes in clean-up technologies, future legislation and the extent or
nature of the clean up required.  Nevertheless, it argues that such
liabilities and risks qualify for recognition as a provision in the
balance sheet if the company has a legal or contractual obligation to
prevent, reduce or repair environmental damage, or if its management is
committed to such action through things like statements of policy or
intention, industry practice or public expectations, or communication
of such a decision either internally or externally.

The amount of a provision, it suggests, should be based on reasonable
estimates of the loss, if necessary within a range, with a contingent
liability note where it is possible that the loss will be greater than
expected.  If no reasonable estimate can be made, which the document
describes as "rare circumstances", "the company should at least
disclose the nature of the contingent liability as well as the
circumstances and risks involved in the notes to the accounts."  The
amount recorded as a company's expected future environmental
expenditures should, the document says, be sufficient "to cover the
full costs of the damage to the environment for which the company is
responsible, irrespective of the date at which the activity is ceased."

Except where long-term de-commissioning costs for such facilities as
drilling platforms or nuclear power stations can be clearly
distinguished from other liability provisions, the Forum interprets the
4th Directive as requiring that the full charge should be included in
the profit and loss account as soon as it arises, and not spread over
several years.  This is despite the fact that the Forum recognises that
new legislation or discovery of unexpected liabilities may involve
accumulated expenditures which are so large that they distort the
company's accounts in that year, making it difficult to interpret its
underlying economic performance.

The document defines criteria for capitalising environmental
expenditures and it recommends more generally that gross liabilities
and expected recoveries, through counter-claims, insurance cover or
similar agreements, be shown separately in the balance sheet, rather
than presenting liabilities in net form.  In terms of disclosure, the
document says that environmental issues should only be disclosed in
accounts and annual reports "to the extent that they are material to
the financial performance or financial position of the undertaking",
with exemptions where member states have introduced them for small and
medium-size companies.

It suggests that the notes on the accounts should include the amount
capitalised and analysis of the amount charged to the profit and loss
account "in a manner appropriate to the nature and size of business
and/or the types of environmental issues relevant to the enterprise",
including factors as prevention, reduction and repair of environmental
damage.  The notes should also, it states, cover costs incurred as
fines or penalties for non-compliance and compensation to third parties
for loss or injury (which the Forum excludes from its "narrow"
definition of environmental expenditures).  In the annual report, the
Forum argues, information could include a description of the issues
which are relevant to the financial position and the undertaking's
response to them, the enterprise's environmental policy, improvements
that have been made in key areas, available government incentives, the
extent of measures which are in the process of implementation and a
reference to any other information provided in a separate environmental
report.

GUARANTEE REQUIREMENTS POSTPONED

A Decree issued at the beginning of January has postponed the deadlines
previously set for operators of certain high risk installations in
France to obtain financial guarantees to cover factors such as accident
and pollution response measures, site restoration after closure and
site monitoring and security.  The deadline for such guarantees had
been 13 December 1995, but the French Environment Ministry announced
shortly before that that implementation would be delayed.  Under Decree
no 96-18 of 5 January 1996, the guarantee requirements are still
brought into effect from 14 December 1995 for all new waste storage
facilities and mining operations (ie, those whose initial authorisation
is after that date), but the deadline for such sites which were already
in operation is postponed until 14 June 1999.  New industrial
facilities will have until 14 December 1997 to obtain such guarantees,
while it appears that no date has been set for existing industrial
facilities.

These provisions come under Article 23 of the 1976 Classified
Installations Law, as amended by Decree no 94-848 of 9 June 1994
(ELR011/3).  The 1994 Decree specified elements of the different
categories of installation which had to be covered, required all
guarantees to be renewed at least three months before their expiry and
tied them to particular operators, so that any change of ownership or
control would require a new guarantee.  Patrick Thieffry, of Thieffry &
Associes, Paris, told a conference in Vienna in November (this issue
p7) that the reason for delay was that qualifying financial securities
were generally not available in France as yet from banks or insurers
and no alternative fund had been established, as permitted under the
law.  A few such guarantees had been issued, he said, but only on a
case-by-case basis and at a local level.

Mr Thieffry placed all this in the context of increasingly tight
policing of the so-called classified installations, which include a
large number of relatively high risk plants in France.  He referred to
case law under the 1976 Law which showed that French courts will uphold
orders against current operators requiring them to restore a site to
"such a condition that it presents none of the hazards or
inconveniences" which the law seeks to eliminate.  He observed that
this responsibility was irrespective of whether the operator was in
charge of the site at the time that the relevant pollution occurred and
that the requirement extended to events occurring before 1976, with the
Conseil d'Etat linking it to a prior 1917 Law on Classified
Installations.

Mr Thieffry cited as an example the case of a Marrion Merrel Dow site
in Yvelines, where the company was having to conduct a major clean-up
operation even though it only acquired the site in 1981 while the toxic
chemicals involved had been dumped between 1965 and 1969.  In that
case, over 80 tonnes of various toxic chemicals, 300 tonnes of acetic
acid and 650 tonnes of alcohol had been deposited in a basin, from
which it had leaked into chalky soil and spread, with a vulnerable
water course nearby. ELR understands that the pollution only came to
light when Marrion Merrel Dow was in the process of selling the site to
a new owner in 1992 and resulted in the contaminated part of the site
having to be withdrawn from the sale, pending satisfactory clean up.
The operation is expected to last seven years and to include 15
drilling operations to divert the flow of pollutants away from the
perimeter and removal of some 2,500 tonnes of contaminated soil, Mr
Thieffry said.

ISO PUBLISHES SUPERFUND REPORT

The US Insurance Services Office (ISO), New York, an industry body
serving the property/casualty insurance industry, has published a
report* on the Superfund hazardous substance clean-up law, which is
currently subject to Congressional attempts at reform (ELR027/3, 026/1
& 3, et al).  The report, entitled "Superfund and the Insurance Issues
Surrounding Abandoned Hazardous Waste Sites" was published on 29
December.  It gives a range of estimates for the long-term costs to
insurers from such waste sites, based on previous studies, of between
$25bn and $608bn, although it notes that most recent estimates are at
the low end of the range and that discounting for net present value
would substantially reduce the numbers.  It places these figures
alongside the total US property/casualty insurance industry's statutory
surplus at the end of 1994 of $191bn, but it notes that a small number
of large writers of commercial liability insurance are likely to bear
most of the cost.  The combined surplus of the 35 most exposed to these
losses stood at $85bn.

The report highlights as prime insurer concerns about Superfund:
adverse court decisions which find unintended cover in old insurance
policies, difficulty in establishing plausible estimates of liabilities
and reserves due to conflicting court rulings and other factors, unfair
cost allocation among potentially responsible parties (PRPs) and their
insurers, and high litigation costs related to coverage disputes and
policyholder defence.  It cites a number of studies into transaction
costs in the Superfund process, including legal costs, and highlights a
1994 Government Accounting Office GAO survey which found that such
costs represented approximately one-third of PRPs' costs and an A M
Best study in the same year which estimated the insurance industry's
litigation cost share at 45%.

The report reviews the range of reform options currently on the
political agenda, focussing particularly on elimination of retroactive
liability and joint and several liability, revision of clean-up
standards and remedy selection, and delegation of clean-up authority to
the states.  It concludes that many of the proposed reforms would
reduce environmental liabilities for industry and for insurers, but
many could also increase expenses for the federal government.  In that
context, it notes that the potential payers of the taxes which the
government would be likely to raise to meet those costs, especially the
petroleum, chemical and insurance industries, disagree on the best
approach.  Overall, the report suggests that Superfund and clean up of
hazardous waste will continue to be difficult issues for insurers,
public policy-makers and society as a whole, and that the size of the
required clean up and the question of who should pay will remain the
focus of debate for many years to come.

SPATE OF OIL/CHEMICAL SPILLS

Anyone taking a snapshot of recent events in Russia could be forgiven
for thinking that something close to an epidemic of oil spills and
other leaks was taking place.  The incidents have been of varying sizes
and the overall significance of them is hard to gauge.  Nevertheless,
there seems little doubt that the general condition of the pipeline
system falls well short of what would be required in most OECD
countries and reports from depots elsewhere in Russia and the former
Soviet bloc suggest a routine disregard in the past for basic
environmental standards during operations such as oil delivery at rail
terminals and refineries.

The most serious spill in recent weeks seems to have been one in
December in the republic of Bashkortostan, at the southern end of the
Urals, where a 700mm oil pipeline, more than 30 years old and running
along the bottom of the river Belaya, was found to have burst on 26
December near the capital city of Ufa, south-west of Sverdlovsk.
Initial reports indicated that a 100 tonne (t) oil slick was presenting
difficulties because of severe weather conditions which were preventing
the use of specialised recovery equipment and even attempts to burn off
the oil.  According to news agency reports in early January, oil was by
then being removed by means of buckets through holes in the ice which
covered the river.  Only some 15t had been recovered a week after the
incident and there were fears that the oil might eventually reach the
Kama river and ultimately the Volga and the Caspian Sea.  Emergency
services were reported to be building a protective shield near
Blagoveshchensk, 40km downstream from Ufa, to try to stop that
happening and both Bashkortostan and neighbouring Tatarstan had issued
pollution warnings.

A few days later, however, the Bashkortostan Environment Minister,
Rustem Khamitov, declared that the pipeline's owner had "seriously
violated the truth" in saying that 100t of oil had been lost; the
reality was that a much larger quantity had escaped, he said, and the
crucial objective was to recover and neutralise as much as possible
before the spring thaw in 50-70 days time.  According to Reuters, the
state pipeline monopoly Transneft had declared two days after the
incident that the leak had been dealt with, but Tass was now reporting
that 160 workers were still struggling to control the leak.  The pipe
had apparently been shut off, booms put across the river and the oil
set on fire to stop it spreading.  Some 664t of oil and water were said
to have been collected, of which up to 15% was oil.  At the same time,
oil was reported to have reached Tatarstan, 160km from Ufa.

By mid-January, weak ice on the river was forcing the authorities to
resort to wider oil burning, leading Mr Khamitov to go on television to
reassure people whose homes were being "covered with smoke" as the fire
spread over a large area.  The pipeline company was by then claiming
that 468t of oil had escaped, but other estimates put the figure at up
to 2,400t.  On the other hand, according to Trud newspaper, pollution
readings in the Belaya which showed concentrations of petroleum
products five times maximum permissible levels had to be put in the
context of routine chemical contamination of the river and common
background levels of petroleum products of 2-3 times the official
limits in winter and up to 10 times in summer.  A Greenpeace
representative claimed that leaks from Russia's ageing pipeline network
were so routine now that they resulted in the loss of between 2% and
10% of the country's oil each year, representing total leaks of 20-50
million tonnes (mt) a year.

On 26 January, a Tatarstan environment official told a press conference
in Kazan that, extrapolating from the concentrations reaching the Tatar
town of Aktanysh, it appeared that 12,000-13,000t of oil must have
leaked into the Belaya.  The Interfax news agency was quoted as saying
that divers had still not located the precise point of the leak because
of silting in the river and were therefore raising the pipe to the
surface for inspection.  Meanwhile, some 150km upstream of the Ufa oil
spill, a serious leak of phenol occurred on 19 January at the Salavat
oil refinery, involving the loss of around 2 cubic metres of this toxic
substance.  The spill was initially turning into a snow-like solid in
the severe frost and efforts were being made to recover it in that
condition before a thaw allowed it to dissipate into the Belaya.

In the same month that all this was going on, a number of other serious
incidents were also reported.  On 24 December, some 400t of oil leaked
from the Ukhta-Yaroslavl pipeline in the northern Komi republic,
although the plume from this seemed to have been contained within an
area of around 5,000 square metres.  On 16 January, a second spill was
discovered in the same pipeline, this time near the town of Kotlas, in
Archangel region. Some 70t of oil were reported to have escaped, but it
appeared that none had reached the Severnaya Dvina river and work was
progressing to collect and burn it off.  On 11 January, a bulldozer
breached part of Surgut-Polotsk pipeline in the Perm region,
immediately north of Bashkortostan, releasing according to one estimate
242t of oil.  On 16 January, it was reported that a slick extending
over 2.5km had been discovered on the Syzranka river in Samara region,
west of Tatarstan.  This seemed to have leaked from an underwater
stretch of the Syzran-Zolnoye pipeline, possibly as a result of
corrosion. The total quantity of oil leaked was not known, but again
the huge river Volga was threatened as the slick occurred only 8km from
the meeting of the two rivers.

The Baltic republic of Latvia has also been experiencing some similar
problems.  In November, 100t of diesel escaped from a pipeline linking
central Russia with the Latvian port of Ventspils, apparently the
result of a breach made by thieves some 12km east of Ventspils.  A
senior Latvian official called for a return to regular inspection of
his country's pipelines, which he said had been left without any
supervision and had become an easy target for petroleum thieves who
damaged the pipelines.  On 16 January, a leak of petroleum products
from a wharf in Ventspils was reported to have reached the Baltic.

WASTE TREATMENT DISPUTE

A plan by the Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand (IEAT) to provide
mobile waste treatment units at all the country's industrial estates is
reported to have running into difficulty as a result of a previous
government contract with a Thai-US joint venture, Genco, to build
Thailand's first modern hazardous waste facility in Rayong province.
That contract gave Genco the sole right to operate hazardous waste
plants, according to FT Water Briefing.  Genco had planned to have its
plant up and running by early 1996, but had to stop work late last year
in the face of opposition from local residents who fear pollution to
local streams.  A government-run treatment plant in Bankhunthien has
been working at only 10% of its 110,000 tonne capacity, apparently
because the majority of factories evade laws requiring treatment of all
toxic waste and pay for illegal dumping.  An estimated 1m tonnes of
toxic waste is produced each year in Thailand.

ASSESSMENT OF THE LOSS AND DEGRADATION OF ECOSYSTEMS IN
THE U.S.

This (National Biological Service) report: presents
estimates of declines of natural ecosystems in the
U.S.; provides a rationale for ecosystem-level
conservation; discusses decline and threat as criteria
for conservation; and relates ecosystem losses to
endangerment at species and population levels.  It
suggests that integrated conservation plans be
developed for all ecosystems in each ecoregion of the
U.S., starting with types and regions that sustained
the greatest losses and are at greatest risk of further
loss.

ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION IN THE U.S.

At its core, environmental restoration -- defined as
the cleanup of contaminants from past activities --
depends on a series of decisions about the nature and
extent of contamination, the risk to human health and
the environment, and the potential effectiveness of
remediation techniques and technologies to reduce the
risk to acceptable levels.  The effectiveness with
which these decisions are made has significant impact
on the cost and duration of the cleanup efforts.  The
decisions must often be made on the basis of incomplete
and uncertain data.  Emerging environmental information
and data acquisition technologies, together with
appropriate strategies to support decision-making, are
beginning to change the way environmental restoration
occurs in the U.S.

Past environmental restoration activities too often
relied on prescriptive data collection activities to
generate the information upon which decisions were
made.  Retrospective studies of such activities show
that often data were gathered for the purpose of
reducing the risk in decision-making, but little true
reduction in risk was realized and large amounts of
resources were consumed.  Recent examination of the
failures in the U.S. to achieve many complete cleanups,
despite the investment of large sums and time, points
to the inability to have decisions made efficiently.

The solution to the problem involves both regulatory
change to allow more flexibility in decision-making and
the introduction of technology to improve
decision-making.  This (Argonne National Laboratory)
paper reviews recent assessments made of cleanup
processes and the application of strategies and
technologies to enhance decision-making for cleanup.
It provides examples of the decision-making approaches
and the technologies that have been employed to speed
up characterization and to optimize the implementation
of remediation.

PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY AND THE ENVIRONMENT

From the ozone hole and the greenhouse effect, to
plastics recycling and hazardous waste disposal,
society faces a number of issues requiring an
unprecedented understanding of the properties of
molecules.  We are coming to realize that the
environment is a coupled set of chemical systems.  Its
dynamics determine the welfare of the biosphere and of
humans in particular.  These chemical systems are
governed by fundamental molecular interactions, and
they present chemists with an unparalleled challenge.
The application of current concepts of molecular
behavior and of up-to-date experimental and
computational techniques can provide us with
environmental insights needed to: mitigate past damage;
anticipate the impact of current human activity; and
avoid future insults to the environment.

Environmental chemistry encompasses a number of
separate, yet interlocking, areas of research.  In all
of these areas, progress is limited by an inadequate
understanding of the underlying chemical processes
involved.  Participation of all chemical approaches
(experimental, theoretical, and computational) and of
all disciplines of chemistry (organic, inorganic,
physical, analytical, and biochemistry) will be
required to provide the necessary fundamental
understanding.  This (Battelle Pacific Northwest
Laboratories) paper discusses physical chemistry and
the environment.

JUDGING THE HEALTH RISKS OF ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES

This (Brookhaven National Laboratory) report provides
perspective on the various risks to which man is
routinely exposed.  It serves as a basis for
understanding the meaning of quantitative risk
estimates and for comparing new or newly-discovered
risks with other better-understood risks.  Specific
emphasis is placed on the health risks of energy
technologies.  The report is not a risk assessment, nor
does it contain instructions on how to do a risk
assessment; rather, it provides background information
on how most of us think about risks and why it is
difficult to do it rationally.  It provides a
philosophy and data to use to do a better job of
judging risks more rationally.  It also provides an
overview of where the risks of energy technologies fit
within the spectrum of all risks.  Much of the
quantitative information provided is on the relative
risk of dying of various causes.  This is not because
the risk of dying is seen as the most important kind of
risk, but because the statistics on mortality rates by
cause are the highest-quality data available on health
risks in the general population.  (Although the report
is dated Sep. 1992, it was revised in May 1994.)

ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES USING LIDAR

This translation of a Doctoral thesis from Sweden (Lund
University) concerns the application of lidar
techniques in environmental studies.  Lidar
measurements are performed with a mobile lidar system,
based on a Nd:YAG-pumped dye laser, to measure mercury
fluxes on emissions from chlor-alkali plants in Sweden
and Italy.  An Italian cinnabar mining area (where
mining activities stopped in 1982) is mapped, and high
fluxes of atomic mercury vapor are detected.
Comparative measurements are also made using a
conventional gold-amalgamation-point monitor.

Plumes from geothermal plants in Italy are also
monitored, and it is found that the amount of mercury
emitted is much higher than expected.  Lidar
measurements are also performed on the gas plumes
emerging from the Italian volcanoes Etna, Stromboli,
and Vulcano, using a lidar system on a ship that made
traverses under the plumes.

A vertically-sounding ozone lidar system for
tropospheric measurements has also been constructed,
based on a KrF excimer laser whose output is
Raman-shifted in hydrogen to obtain wavelengths of  277
and 313 nm.  Comparisons with two other ozone
monitoring systems -- a ND:YAG/dye laser based the
lidar system, and a differential absorption optical
system (DOAS) -- are carried out.  The mobile lidar
system is integrated with a spectrally-resolving
optical multi-channel system and a multi-color imaging
system, to remotely detect fluorescence from vegetation
and water.  It is found that the fluorescence spectra
from vegetation exposed to environmental stress are
different from the spectra detected from control
vegetation.  Fluorescence images are recorded from
distances up to 100 m.  The thesis contains
157 references and 15 figures.

CARBON MONOXIDE EXPOSURES INSIDE OF AUTOMOBILES

This (EPA) paper deals with carbon monoxide (CO)
exposures measured inside a motor vehicle during
88 standardized drives on a major urban arterial
highway (El Camino Real) having a traffic volume of
30,500-45,000 vehicles per day, over a 13-1/2 month
period.  For the 88 trips, the mean CO concentration
was 9.8 ppm, with a standard deviation of 5.8 ppm.  A
fairly-strong seasonal trend exists for the co-variates
that were examined: ambient CO at 2 fixed stations;
atmospheric stability; seasonal trend function; time of
day; average surrounding vehicle count; trip duration;
proportion of time stopped at lights; and instrument
type.  A model consisting of only a single measure of
traffic volume and a seasonal trend component, has
substantial predictive power; by contrast, the ambient
CO levels, although partially correlated with average
exposures, contributed comparatively little predictive
power to the model.  The study shows that: (1) the mass
balance equation can relate exterior CO concentrations
as a function of time, to interior CO concentrations;
(2) CO exposures on urban arterial highways vary with
season; (3) momentary CO experienced behind red lights
vary with the intersection; and (4) an averaging-time
model can simulate exposures during short trips
(20 minutes or less) on urban arterial highways.

SURVEY OF WORKER HEALTH SYMPTOMS AND INDOOR AIR IN
OFFICE BUILDINGS

This (EPA) paper reports the results of a questionnaire
on health symptoms, workplace conditions, and perceived
indoor air quality that was administered to a total of
3948 employees of the EPA working in 3 office buildings
in Washington, DC, to determine the personal or
workplace characteristics associated with health
symptoms.  A principal-components analysis of 32 health
symptoms identified 12 health factors, each generally
associated with a particular body system (eyes, nose,
throat, chest, central nervous system, etc.).  The  12
health factors have been regressed linearly on  50-100
personal, workplace, and spatial characteristics
identified from the questionnaire and building
blueprints.  Significant variables (p <0.01) are
included in a second logistic regression to determine a
final model.

USING GAS REBURNING TECHNOLOGY TO REDUCE ATMOSPHERIC
NOx EMISSIONS FROM FURNACES AND KILNS

This (Energy and Environmental Analysis Inc.) report
analyzes a number of industrial processes and assesses
the suitability of using natural gas reburning
technology to achieve reduced NOx emissions.  In gas
reburning, a small amount of gas -- typically 10-15% of
the total fuel input -- is injected above the primary
fuel zone to create a fuel-rich reburn zone where NOx
is reduced.  Gas reburning has the capability to reduce
NOx emissions by 50-65%, but its use in particular
applications is dependent on specific process and
combustion parameters.  The report identifies five
industrial processes as being suitable for natural gas
reburning: glass melting furnaces; cement kilns; reheat
furnaces; process heaters; and waste-heat recovery
systems.

GAS REBURN TECHNOLOGY TO REDUCE NOx EMISSIONS IN
TANGENTIALLY-FIRED BOILERS [951321]

There are several ways that owners of
tangentially-fired boilers can reduce nitrogen oxides
(NOx) emissions, in order to comply with the Clean Air
Act Amendments of 1990.  This (ABB Combustion
Engineering Services Inc.) report presents and
discusses the development of a close-coupled gas reburn
technology for this purpose.  Close-coupled gas reburn
technology has the potential to be a relatively
lower-cost derivative of standard reburning technology.
A utility scale feasibility, test, and evaluation
program is reported that examines the technology's NOx
reduction capability and its boiler-performance
impacts.

foods representing about 100 countries.  The database
contains three sections.  The first section is a large
detailed data file that presents FDA pesticide
monitoring coverage and findings by country/food
product/pesticide combination.  The other two sections
are smaller summary files that provide an overview by
country/pesticide combination without regard to
pesticide, and by country/pesticide combination without
regard to product.  They are accompanied by a search
program and report formats that enable users to perform
simple searches and generate reports.  The raw data by
individual sample, from which the three files are
compiled, are also provided.  The diskettes contain
text only; users must provide their own search and
retrieval software.  They are formatted in Dbase III
Plus.  Memory requirement is 640 K, and an IBM
compatible 486 computer is recommended for practical
processing speed.  The files are compressed, 1.44 M
high-density.

REMOVING PCBs FROM CONTAMINATED SOIL USING THE CF
SYSTEM(tm) SOLVENT EXTRACTION PROCESS

This (Science Applications International Corp.) report
covers a treatability study of the removal of PCBs from
contaminated soil using the CF System(tm) Solvent
Extraction Process.  Soil samples were obtained from
the Springfield Township Superfund Site, Davisburg
Michigan, taken from a specific area of that site
known to have some of the highest concentrations of
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).  The samples were
shipped to Hazen Research Corporation, Golden,
Colorado, where CF-System's Solvent Extraction pilot
plant is located.  The results show that the process is
effective in reducing the concentration of PCBs in site
soils.  Removal efficiencies range from a low of 91.4%
when two extraction cycles are used, to 99.4% when five
extraction cycles are used.

CONTAMINATED SOIL RESTORATION USING VAPOR EXTRACTION

This Master's thesis (from the University of Texas)
presents a review of vapor extraction technology for
remediation of contaminated soils.  Effective
remediation of sites contaminated with VOCs (volatile
organic compounds) requires a sound understanding of
regulatory issues, technology options, and the site
hydrogeology.  A technology that is increasingly being
used for the remediation of VOC-contaminated sites is
soil vapor extraction.  Soil vapor extraction, also
known as soil venting and soil air stripping, allows
remediation of VOC contamination without the need for
excavation.  In soil vapor extraction, a vacuum pump or
blower moves air through the soil near the contaminated
zone.  As contaminated air is removed, cleaner air
moves through the soil to replace it.  This air
movement can also promote microbial degradation of
contaminants at many sites.

IN SITU RADIO FREQUENCY (RF) HEATING TO ENHANCE VAPOR
EXTRACTION OF CONTAMINANTS FROM SOIL

This (Westinghouse Savannah River Co.) report presents
and discusses a field demonstration program involving
in situ radio frequency heating to investigate its
effectiveness as an enhancement to vacuum extraction of
residual solvents (primarily trichloroethylene and
perchloroethylene) held in vadose zone clay deposits.
Conventional soil vacuum extraction techniques are
mass-transfer limited because of the low permeabilities
of the clays.  By selectively heating the clays to
temperatures at or above 100 C, the release or
transport of the solvent vapors are enhanced as a
result of several factors, including: an increase in
the contaminant vapor pressure; an increase in
diffusivity; and an increase in the effective
permeability of the formation caused by the release of
water vapor.

OXYGEN-ENRICHED CO-INCINERATION OF MUNICIPAL SOLID
WASTE (MSW) AND SEWAGE SLUDGE

This (NREL) report deals with co-incineration of MSW
and sewage sludge.  Federal regulations banning ocean
dumping of sewage sludge, coupled with stricter
regulations on the disposal of sewage sludge in
landfills, have forced municipalities (especially those
in the northeast U.S.) to consider alternate methods
for disposal of this solid waste.  Co-incineration of
MSW and sludge has proven to be economically attractive
in both Europe and Japan, but has not yet proven to be
a viable sludge disposal technology in the U.S.,
because of a history of operational problems in
existing facilities.  The most prevalent problem in co-
incinerating MSW and a dewatered sewage sludge (15% to
25% solids) is incomplete sludge combustion.
Incomplete combustion is primarily a function of sludge
particle problems that occur when the surface of the
sludge particle dries and hardens while the inner mass
is unaffected.  This phenomenon is commonly referred to
in the industry as the "hamburger effect."

This report details a new process being developed for
the disposal of a dewatered sewage sludge.  It provides
a comprehensive summary of the pilot demonstration test
program for oxygen-enriched co-incineration of MSW and
sewage sludge, including description of: the pilot test
facility; the instrumentation; the methods of data
collection; data analyses; how the tests were executed;
and the test results.  The report also provides
recommendations for the future development of this
technology in the current marketplace.

ALTERNATIVE FINANCING FOR STATE WATER PROGRAMS

This (EPA) paper examines the need for increased
funding to support implementation of state program
requirements under the Clean Water Act and the Safe
Drinking Water Act.  It identifies alternative
financing mechanisms that can be used, together with
general revenues, to fund state water quality programs.
It also describes several financial management options
that are designed to maintain control over, and provide
flexibility in, managing program resources, as well as
institutional arrangements that can offset program
costs and leverage state resources.  It lists steps
that EPA can take to support the use of alternative
financing mechanisms by states, and to assist states in
closing the funding gap in water programs.  (This 1989
report has recently been re-announced and re-released
by EPA.)

CANDIDATE PROCESSES FOR IN SITU TREATMENT OF MIXED VOC
AND RADIOACTIVE CONTAMINANTS IN GROUNDWATER

This (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) report describes
the screening and preliminary evaluation of candidate
treatment for use in treating mixed contaminant
volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and radionuclides in
groundwater.  Treating mixed contaminants presents
unusual difficulties.  Typically, VOCs are the most
abundant contaminants, but the presence of
radionuclides results in additional health concerns
that must be addressed, usually by a treatment approach
different from that used for VOCs.  Furthermore, the
presence of radionuclides may yield mixed solid wastes
if the VOCs are treated by conventional means.

These issues are specifically addressed in the
evaluation of candidate treatment processes for testing
in this program.  Moreover, because no research or
early development of a particular process would be
performed, the technology review also focuses on
technologies that could be readily adapted and
integrated for use with mixed contaminants.  The
objective is to couple emerging or available processes
into treatment modules for use in situ.  The findings
reported in this document encompass all activities
through the treatment process evaluations.

MODULAR RISK ANALYSIS FOR ASSESSING SITES CONTAINING
MULTIPLE MIXED RADIOACTIVE WASTES

This (Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories) report
concerns modular risk analysis for assessing mixed
waste sites.  Human-health impacts, especially to the
surrounding public, are extremely difficult to assess
at installations that contain multiple waste sites and
a variety of mixed waste constituents (e.g., organic,
inorganic, and radioactive wastes).  These assessments
must address: different constituents; multiple waste
sites; multiple release patterns; different transport
pathways (i.e., groundwater, surface water, air, and
overland soil); different receptor types and locations;
various times of interest; population distributions;
land-use patterns; baseline assessments; a variety of
exposure scenarios; etc.  Utilizing a modular/GIS
(geographical information system)-based approach
overcomes difficulties in (1) analyzing a wide variety
of scenarios for multiple mixed waste sites and (2)
communicating results from a complex human-heath-impact
analysis by capturing the essence of the assessment in
a relatively elegant manner -- so the meaning of the
results can be quickly conveyed to all who review them.

WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH 104,000,000 CUBIC FEET OF LOW
LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTE

The Fernald Site, a DOE uranium metal production
facility that ceased production in 1989, is now being
remediated by the DOE under terms of a consent
agreement with the EPA and the State of Ohio.  It is
estimated that the cleanup will generate 104,000,000
cubic feet of low-level radioactive waste, including
construction debris, pit sludge, radium residue, and a
huge volume of uranium-contaminated soil.  The waste
handling strategy for this huge volume of waste
includes minimizing remedial waste generation,
recycling material when economically feasible,
free-releasing clean material, and volume reduction.
It is anticipated that large-scale radium residue
vitrification and sludge drying equipment/facilities
will be constructed onsite for waste treatment prior to
off-site disposal.  Fernald waste disposition will
include both onsite disposal (if approved under CERCLA)
and off-site disposal at both commercial and DOE waste
disposal facilities.  The waste disposition strategy
selected reflects a diverse variety of technical,
political, regulatory, and economic factors.  This
(Fernald Environmental Restoration Management Corp.)
paper describes the current views at Fernald on what
can be done with 104,000,000 cubic feet of Fernald
waste.

THE POTENTIAL RISKS OF NUCLEAR SHIPS

This translation from Denmark (Technical University of
Denmark) represents an evaluation of the potential
risks of nuclear ships.  Reasons are given why nuclear
ship accidents will not lead to accidents of the
magnitude of the Chernobyl accident.  This is due to
the much lower content of radioactive material and to
different reactor designs.  A review is given of the
types of nuclear ship accidents that have actually
occurred, with extra consideration given to reactivity
accidents and loss of coolant accidents that could lead
to serious radiation consequences for the crew and the
environment.  The report also discusses the long-term
risks of sunken nuclear ships and sea-disposed reactor
compartments.  Based on available accident data, an
attempt is made to estimate the probability of future
serious nuclear ship accidents.

SLANTS AND TRENDS


Bioremediation Shifts: FIND/SVP Inc., a New York-based
worldwide consulting and research firm, recently published a
170-page report, The Market for Bioremediation Products and
Services. The study focuses on the restoration market as
trends shift from research to actual cleanup. Since its
birth in the mid-1980s, the remediation market has grown
rapidly. "Bioremediation is not only the most
environmentally benign cleanup technology, it is often the
least expensive and the fastest. At a recently documented
groundwater contamination site, non-biological cleanup
methods would have taken up to 50 years to purify the water
and surrounding soils, while bioremediation took only two
years to do the job."

   But there are "formidable challenges" despite the growing
number of sites that require cleanup. The report puts into
perspective the mood of the 104th congress which appears
ready to eliminate the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA). There also is a complicated entanglement of
regulations that inhibit growth and practical application of
research. "Not only is hazardous waste assessment and
cleanup frequently a complex process, negotiating the
bureaucratic bidding process can be even more daunting."
Ethical implications surrounding the introduction of
genetically engineered life forms to degrade contamination
are another area of concern.

   These formidable challenges are not enough, however, to
prevent a compound annual growth rate of 16 percent to the
year 2000, according to FIND/SVP. Although the mood in
congress is hostile to EPA, there is support for military
site cleanup and the timing is such that results from
research are ready for large-scale implementation. "The
development of many new cost-effective and time-saving
bioremediation technologies...will [be favored] over other
cleanup methods." FIND/SVP also predicts cleanup
responsibilities will shift from federal to state and
private-party payers. The report should prove beneficial to
businesses that seek to expand and streamline efforts in a
fairly optimistic market. The Market for Bioremediation and
Services is priced at $2,250 and can be obtained by

Americas, New York, NY 10011-2002. To see the table of

EMERGING MARKETS: Interest in environmental goods and
services continues to grow in Central Europe and the former
Eastern Bloc despite political and economic unrest. Many
countries like the Czech and Slovak Republics, Hungary and
Poland are adopting Western-style environmental regulations.
Privatization also has put cleanup and preventative concerns
in the hands of individuals rather than unaccountable,
state-run bureaucracies. Still, creating a climate conducive
to sustaining a development ethic is difficult in tight
economic times. Pollution prevention and remediation
programs could slow without adequate funding or enforcement
of regulations.

UKRAINE, G-7 FINALLY AGREE
TO REMEDIATE CHERNOBYL


   Closure and remediation of Ukraine's troubled Chernobyl
nuclear power plant may soon begin as a result of the Dec.
20 accord between Kiev and the Group of Seven (G-7) most
industrialized countries. Meeting in Ottawa, the parties
signed a memorandum of understanding that $2.3 billion in
international financial aid would be made available to help
Ukraine close Chernobyl by 2000, according to a statement
issued after the event.

   Canada presently holds the G-7 chairmanship and the deal
was signed by Canadian Environment Minister Sheila Copps and
Ukrainian Environment Minister Yuri Kostenko. The European
Union also is a signatory.

   In addition to closure and remediation, the plan calls
for the development of replacement energy sources, including
the construction of two water-cooled reactors, the statement
says. The two new reactors meet all Western safety
standards, officials said. Western nuclear officials
repeatedly have said they would like all the graphite-
moderated RBMK reactors to be dismantled, replaced with
water-cooled units or otherwise upgraded to meet
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) standards. The
problem, they say, is funding.

   "The closure of Chernobyl will be an important step
toward improving nuclear safety, not only in Central and
Eastern Europe, but throughout the entire world as well,''
the statement quotes Copps as saying.

   Kostenko has criticized Western governments for focusing
too much attention on Chernobyl while ignoring safety
concerns associated with the former Soviet Union's 11
similar graphite-moderated reactors. Following the signing,
however, he appealed to the West to be promptly forthcoming
with the financial assistance. The Ukraine Environment
Minister said he is concerned about a meltdown occurring at
Russia's Khorsk facility which, because it is near Ukraine,
would be as devastating to Ukraine citizens as was the
Chernobyl accident.

   Although not legally binding, the MOU creates a backdrop
on which concrete closure plans can be based, Kostenko said.
The fact the deal is not binding prompted outrage from
environmental groups, which said such errors as failing to
set a specific shutdown date are major problems. In its
statement, Greenpeace International said offering to help
Ukraine finish work on two more reactors was
counterproductive.

   Aid package specifics include: $498 million in grants
from G-7 member states, $349 million of which will go to
nuclear safety and decommissioning; and $1.8 billion in loan
financing from international agencies. Of the total $2.3
billion, nearly $1.9 billion will be invested in new energy.

NORWAY, RUSSIA WILL COMBINE EFFORTS
TO CLEAN UP SPENT FUEL NEAR BORDER


   In a bid to dispel concerns about radiation hazards posed
by waste facilities on Russia's Kola Peninsula and Novaya
Zemlya Island, Moscow and Oslo agreed to cooperate on
routine inspections and public notifications. In an
agreement reached in Moscow Dec. 15 between Russian Defense
Minister Pavel Grachev and Norwegian Defense Minister
Joergen Kosmo, the two countries will work together to
monitor and eventually dispose of military nuclear waste,
especially spent fuel held near the Norwegian border.

   Russian authorities have denied there are any major
radiation risks on Kola or Novaya Zemlya and want to use
cooperation with an internationally trusted state like
Norway to help dispel some of the negative press. Although
no concrete evidence of radiation leaks has been reported,
people working with such organizations as Norway's Bellona
environmental group say Russian authorities deny them
permission to inspect many military sites.

LOCKHEED TAKES-ON CLEANUP
SPARGING FROM HORIZONTAL WELLS
ATTACKS VOC PLUME IN PINELLAS, FLA.


   An ambitious air sparging system at Lockheed-Martin's
Pinellas Plant, near Largo, Fla., aims at remediating an
entire vinyl chloride plume. Since September, the process
has dramatically reduced contaminant concentrations at all
monitoring wells. Air sparging consists of injecting
compressed air below the water table. As air bubbles upward,
volatile compounds partition into the gas phase and are
carried out of the ground water by rising air. Although air
sparging has been the subject of much research, often in
small field test cells, large-scale deployment of the
technology has been rare. The ground water contaminant plume
being remediated is ideal for  a  pilot  study,  said  Brent
Weesner, engineer in charge of the project at Lockheed-
Martin's Pinellas Plant near Largo, Fla. The plume is about
175 feet long and 75 feet wide, and contains vinyl chloride
at concentrations up to 40 ppb. The plume is well-
characterized. It occurs in an aquifer consisting of very
fine sand about 30 feet thick. A survey using numerous
Hydrocone probes defined the bottom of the aquifer
accurately. The plume is confined mostly to the upper
portion of the aquifer, as shown by Hydrocone samples. All
but two of about 30 samples taken at 25 feet depth showed no
vinyl chloride.

Forget the Monitoring

   Weesner's concept was to go straight for remediation of
the plume, rather than taking the more conventional approach
of carrying out extensive monitoring. Costs for air sparging
were expected to be similar to those for an extended
monitoring program.

   Seven horizontal wells were installed at a design depth
of 28 feet beneath the plume. Lengths ranged from 460 to 560
feet. Wells were drilled from two locations using the "river
crossing" method, in which the drill string was brought back
to the surface at the far end of the drill run. This allowed
pulling the casing through the borehole with a cable, rather
than pushing it into a blind hole from the drilling
location.

   Well installation was relatively uneventful, Weesner
said, in part because of "a great team effort" by the
contractors, GTS Inc., Meriden, Conn. (203-238-4567) and
Consutec, Tampa, Fla. (813-889-7181). The pipe-pulling head
used at first allowed sand to enter the end of the casing.
The contractors designed a better pulling head and had it
built locally.

Special Slotting

   The well casing consisted of two high-density
polyethylene (HDPE) pipes, of 2-inch and 4-inch diameters,
with sand pre-packed between them. Inner and outer casings
had 15 mil slots, cut parallel to the length of the casing
rather than across the casing. Although lengthwise slots are
unusual, they were used in this case to preserve the tensile
strength of the casing, because it had to be pulled through
the borehole. Consutec developed special slotting methods
for this job.

   Another unusual feature of the installation is that the
seven horizontal wells are divided into 15 control zones for
air injection, with one to three control zones per well.
Each control zone is separated from adjacent parts of the
same well, and has its own air control and metering equip-
ment. This arrangement allows concentrating the sparging
efforts in the most contaminated portions of the plume, and
avoids wasting air on portions that have already been
cleaned up. One well with only a single control section was
placed in the middle of the plume so that if sparging had
not worked as planned, the well could have been pumped to
control the spread of the plume.

   Sparge air is collected by a system of pipes laid in
trenches 2 feet deep and backfilled with pea gravel. Pumps
draw the air to a treatment pad, where a carbon filtration
system traps the vinyl chloride for later destruction.

   Results have been very encouraging so far. Sparging
operations started in early September. By October, sampling
showed 1.9 ppb vinyl chloride in one of 19 monitoring wells,
and no detectable concentration in the other 18 wells.
Weesner was concerned, however, that filter packs in the
monitoring wells might act as conduits for air, so that
sparging would be most effective close to the wells - in
other words, the well samples might not be representative of
most of the aquifer.

   During the November sampling, well purging was more
intensive to assure representative sampling. The sparging
system was shut down on a Tuesday, and wells were purged
both Wednesday and Thursday. This time, concentrations were
higher, but still much lower than before sparging - vinyl
chloride concentrations of 1.0 ppb, 1.2 ppb, and 1.9 ppb
were detected in three wells, and none in the remaining 16
wells.

OAK RIDGE OFFERS FIELD SITES
FOR COLLABORATION, RESEARCH


   DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory, near Oak Ridge,
Tenn., is offering use of previously studied field sites at
the laboratory for collaborative ground water research.
Research at these sites has focused on water and contaminant
movement in heterogeneous fractured media. Some of the
specific sites available are:

   Walker Branch Watershed and Melton Branch Watersheds:
These small watersheds (0.47 ha and 0.62 ha, respectively)
are particularly suitable for studies of subsurface
transport processes. Each has a trench excavated across its
outflow region. Trenches are 2.5 m deep and 16 m long, and
contain six pans pressed against the face of the trench to
collect subsurface seepage outflow. A line source for tracer
distribution is buried at the top of each site. Transects of
solution samplers, tensiometers and piezometers are located
throughout the site. Much of the data-collection equipment
is interfaced for computerized data collection.

   West Bear Creek Valley Tracer Test Site: This site was
developed for investigating new ground water tracer
techniques. It is located in an uncontaminated area, and has
been instrumented with more than 70 piezometers, some of
them multi-level, and a rain gauge. Water levels and
temperatures have been recorded at 30 minute intervals for
two years. During the last three years, three principal
tests have been conducted at this field site:

A one-year dissolved-gas tracer test using helium and neon
to test the effect of matrix diffusion on solute transport;

A natural-gradient test that used injection of colloid-size
tracers, including bacteriophage, microbes and microspheres,
to measure fracture-flow velocities; and

A test using microspheres labeled with DNA as tracers of
fracture flow.

   Fractured Rock Sampling Protocol Site: This site has been
used for tracer tests to study ground water sampling methods
in fractured media. At the site, 5 to 6 m of soil and
saprolite overlies folded and fractured shale and limestone.
The site has an injection/pumping well screened from 6 to 20
m, three pairs of wells screened from 5 to 7 m and 18 to 20
m, and three multilevel wells with five sampling ports
installed close to the pairs of wells. Many data are
available from the site, including six pumping tests,
natural water levels, tracer tests using bromide, sulfur
hexafluoride and colloids, continuous core from three holes,
bore-hole flowmeter measurements, point dilution tests,
mineralogical data, field parameters, and geochemical
analyses.

   Tritium Test Site: In 1977, 50 curies of tritium were
released in a open borehole in a fractured shale. Tritium
was monitored in the injection well and in five monitoring
wells for the first five years, with an additional sampling
after 16 years (1993). Efforts to remove the tritium by
pumping were unsuccessful. A large amount of tritium was
still present after 16 years. Results of this test have been
interpreted to indicate the severe limitations of pump-and-
treat methods.

   The trend toward fast, field-based assessment of soil and
ground water contamination received a boost from a new
standard developed by the American Society for Testing and
Materials (ASTM). The standard, PS 3, Provisional Standard
Guide for Accelerated Site Characterization of Suspected
Petroleum Release, is aimed at petroleum-contaminated sites,
but clearly indicates the growing interest in rapid site
characterization. The standard does not offer prescriptive
advice for cleanups. Instead, it lists tools than can be
used to collect samples and tests to analyze the samples.
The standard also provides guidance on conducting site
characterizations.

   In the past, field investigators at contaminated sites
usually drilled borings, took samples and had them analyzed
in a laboratory. This produced data that were often very
accurate, but at the cost of waiting weeks for results.
Often the results showed that additional samples were
needed, and a drilling rig had to be re-mobilized to the
site.

   "The task group believes that it is better to get more
data in a matter of days, even though it may be of slightly
less quality, than a few data points with a higher quality
for which you might have to go back and forth to the site
over the course of a couple of years," said Gilberto Alvarez
of Subcommittee E50.01, part of ASTM Committee E-50 on
Environmental Assessment.

MODULARIZATION, AUTOMATION CUT
N.Y. SUPERFUND SITE CLEANUP COSTS


   Capital and operating costs for ground water and soil
cleanup at a Long Island Superfund site have been minimized
by modularization and automation, said Steve McInerney,
senior process engineer and project manager for Retec Co.,
Concord Mass. The Shore Realty Superfund Site is a former
handling facility at Glenwood Landing in Hempstead Harbor,
N.Y., and was heavily contaminated with petroleum and
solvent hydrocarbons during 36 years of operation.

   Retec selected four technologies for site cleanup - soil
vapor extraction, air sparging, ground water pump and treat,
and bioremediation. The ground water system captures free
product at the downgradient side of the site. EPA's pre-
construction estimate of construction cost was $2.3 million.
Actual construction costs, however, were $2 million, a
savings of about 15 percent.

Components Pre-Assembled

   McInerney attributed a significant part of the saving to
modular construction of treatment plant components. Tanks,
mixers, pumps and other components were pre-assembled into a
few modules at the factory, rather than being assembled
piece by piece at the site. Although this somewhat increased
the cost of the components, it allowed greater savings in
the cost of installation at the site.

   Electrical power and control wiring also were assembled
and terminated in boxes on the modules. Each module thus had
only two connection points where it was tied into power and
control wiring. Except for the thermal oxidation unit that
destroys vapor-phase contaminants, no controls were
installed on the modules. All units were tied to controls
located on a central panel.

Estimates Exeeded Actuals

   Operating costs were estimated at $500,000 per year at
the feasibility study stage, but actual costs are about
$300,000 per year. One reason for lower costs is careful
control of electrical consumption. About half the total
operating costs are for a large compressor that drives the
sparging system. Retec has put much effort into optimizing
the system operation. Sparging rates are kept as low as
possible, and sparging is pulsed to increase system
efficiency.

   The plant is highly automated to keep operating costs
low. The plant is computer-operated; the human operator
visits the plant as needed. If a problem develops, the
computer system automat-ically calls the plant operator's
beeper and notifies the operator of the problem's severity -
from level 1, for minor problems, to level 4, for a total
automatic shutdown. The computer system also continuously
collects data from the system for monitoring its operation.
McInerney downloads these data by telephone every two to
three weeks for inspection of the plant's operations and
continuing efficiency.

GETTING INTO THE ACT
AGRICULTURAL ORGANIZATIONS ANNOUNCE
ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP COOPERATION


   The American Crop Protection Association (ACPA) and the
Agricultural Retailers Association (ARA) announced joint
guidelines to assist the environmental cleanup of retail
agricultural chemical dealer sites. These sites often have
been sources of ground water contamination because of spills
and improper waste disposal.

   The guidelines call for both voluntary and fee-based
reimbursement mechanisms aimed at accelerating assessment
and remediation of contaminated sites. Common elements of
the guidelines, whether voluntary or fee-based, include the
following:

Confidential environmental audits;

Cleanup standards keyed to the future use of the site; and

Acceptance by state authorities of completed remedial
programs.

Incentives

   Key features of voluntary programs include incentives to
property owners, provided sites do not represent immediate
threats to health or the environment, and flexible cleanup
schedules. Key features of fee-based programs are maximum
and minimum balances for the remedial fund, significant
financial deductibles for dealers and growers who initiate
cleanups, ceilings on total reimbursement per remediation
and collection of fees at the retail dealer level.

   To date, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Illinois have enacted
legislation establishing chemical cleanup programs.
Approximately 20 more states, including Ohio and
Pennsylvania, have established voluntary remediation
programs available to everyone, including dealers, growers
and industrial users of agricultural chemicals.

   ACPA is a trade organization of manufacturers,
formulators and distributors of agricultural crop protection
and pest control products. ARA is an organization that
provides information and education to retail farm supply
dealers.

GEL COMPOUND
AUSTRALIAN RESEARCHERS PREVENT
FUELS FROM REACHING DOWN UNDER


   Remediators concerned about safe transportation of
hazardous liquids such as organic solvents, can look to
research being conducted at the University of South
Austrailia where an in-situ gelation process is being
developed. Techsearch, a non-profit group that functions as
a laision with the community, is working with the
University's Polymer Science Group at the Ian Wark Research
Institute to lessen the risk of hazardous liquid cargo
which, if spilled in large quantities, can cause deleterious
affects and long-term environmental damage. Explosion,
flammability, noxious fumes, poisoning, smoke, odors,
irritants and ground water contamination have been a result
of past spills.

   By rapidly injecting a mixture of materials into the
organic liquid, chemical cross-linking occurs in a short
time and a solid network is formed. Solidification prevents
the volatile liquid from escaping holes or ruptures in the
walls of containers damaged during an accident. Gelation
also decreases concentrations of petrol fumes and reduces
the explosion front of fuel which cuts back the possibility
of fire.

10 Percent Solid

   Geoffrey Swincer and Janis Matisons of the University's
School of Chemical Technology discovered the catalytic
process and tested it in laboratory experiments. Certain
compounds - rapidly reacting polymers, monomers, and
functional molecules such as silanes - undergo a rapid
cross-linking action when in contact with fuels which become
trapped in individual cells. The cellular network that
results resembles that of a honeycomb structure. Hard or
gel-like to the touch, the compound may only be 10 percent
solid, 90 percent liquid, when measured by weight.

   The ratio of compound to fuel is relatively low - one
part compound to 30 parts fuel - which is less than 4
percent by volume. Swincer and Matisons feel that continued
research to produce even more efficient gelling compounds
with lower reactive ratios. They also believe that the real
advantage of the process is its speed and that this factor
will lend itself to successful comercialization. Reaction
times have been less than one minute in low-level laboratory
demonstrations. Large volumes of fuel can be gelled in
ruptured tanks or large storage facilities through the use
of a progressive injection system. These delivery systems
can be an integral part of any storage facility or
transportation container. The gel forms a cork or seal
around the point of rupture to prevent further outflow, and
the solidification of the liquid fuel into a mass prevents
it from running underground or into sewer lines and streams.
Damage is quickly limited to the immediate vicinity of the
spill.

Multi-Point Injection

   Conceptualized by Swincer and Matisons, the strategy
behind successful delivery of the gel compound in
transportation tanks is to create a multi-point injection
system, similar to sprinkler systems in large buildings,
around the inner circumference of the container. Activation
would occur upon some predetermined signal, via automatic
detection or manually from a control station. Following the
signal, the entire body of fuel would be surrounded by gel,
the point of rupture sealed, and the core of the liquid
penetrated. A secondary system of directional nozzles, like
those in fire extinguishers, can be applied to any fuel that
has escaped initial treatment. This backup can be used by
ocean going tugs and other emergency vehicles.

Fuel Recycling

   Once the gel compound has done its job, it has to be
cleaned up with shovels and loaders, or by heavy industrial
suction. A gelled slick at sea can be controlled with booms
before being collected and transported by tanker to be
dumped or recycled. One significant advantage of the process
is that fuel can be retrieved by breaking up the gel
structure in a specially designed mixer followed by a
process of filtration and distillation. Compared to more
conventional means of cleanup and recycling, the amount of
fuel lost is far less. Recycling crude after gelation could
be part of the refining process. Researchers estimate
remaining non-toxic solids after recycling to be less than
10 percent of volume and suitable for landfill disposal.

   Researchers also will have to evaluate potential
exothermic reactions of rapid gelation of large volumes of
fuels. The production of heat generated from the process
does not pose a problem in the laboratory, but may in the
field. Evaluating this risk will form part of the next
study.

ENVIRO HAZ TECH OF PA.
MOBILE INJECTION TREATMENT
FOR DENSE CONTAMINATED SOIL


By Elena Marcheso Moreno

   Turning contaminated land into usable construction sites
has great appeal in the competitive world of building
development. Enviro Haz-Tech, an environmental remediation
company in Hegins, Pa., has developed a series of Mobile
Injection Treatment Units (MITUs) that can help remediate
difficult soil conditions, both on unbuilt and built sites.

   Enviro Haz-Tech specializes in treatment of all types of
soils contaminated with petroleum or other hazardous
materials. The patented MITU technology particularly appeals
to building developers because it can handle dense
subsurface contaminated soils under buildings. Cleaning the
soil in place saves developers the costs of transportation
and disposal associated with the alternative solution of
dumping the contaminated soil into landfills, or
incinerating it.

Huge Cost Savings

   By actually treating the soil on-site, the MITU system
can help a land owner save between 40 percent and 60 percent
compared to removing it, Enviro Haz-Tech estimates. Once the
treatment is completed, new soils are not required in order
to develop and build on the site.

   Enviro Haz-Tech's soil treatment unit is comprised of a
John Deere modified hydraulic excavator mounted on a custom
trenching unit equipped with a series of interchangeable
injection systems and full vapor recovery. It includes
proprietary manifolds, pumps, storage tanks, computers,
monitors, and hydraulic controls. The operator can
manipulate all controls from within the cab of the self-
contained unit.

   In addition, the trencher is completely enclosed and has
air emission collection systems that transfer vapors to on-
board treatment equipment. Compliance with air-quality
standards is achieved through computerized monitoring of
organic and inorganic vapors, and other toxic or combustible
emissions.

Soil Injection

   The MITU operator excavates contaminated land within a
predetermined grid, trenching contaminated soil and
injecting it with hot-air, bio-chemicals, slurries, and
stabilization compounds, as required for remediation. All
units use rotary carbide cutting blades that can penetrate
all soils, even dense rock, to depths of 9 meters. A MITU
Mini model was also developed to inject and mix soils to a
maximum depth of 2.5 meters beneath building basements,
concrete slabs, and other structures. The unit's carbide
teeth rotate at three speeds to  break  up  soil
formations   in   46-centimeter widths. Once it has reached
the required depth, one of a variety of injection units
distributes the Enviro mitigating agent into the soil. Soil
passes through the sealed housing, where it is treated.
Microbial and nutrient mixtures are delivered into the
chamber to enhance bioremediation; hot air to encourage
volatile stripping; cement slurry for slurry wall
construction; and absorbants to collect free product. Once
the soil is treated, it is pushed through the undercarriage
of the MITU, reappearing as a clean, fine-grained topsoil.
In all but the most difficult site conditions, the MITU can
treat up to 55 metric tons per hour.

MITU Versatility

   In the past, bioremediation strategies have succeeded
only when employed on porous or semi-porous soils. The new
MITU approach handles all types of soils, according to
Enviro Haz-Tech. In addition to vapor recovery, oils
contaminated with metals or pesticides can be cleaned with
this multiple injection system, which has the ability to
inject remediation agents in the necessary form-solid,
liquid, gas, or slurry.

   When the MITU completes its job, the land left can
immediately be used for buildings that will be occupied by
people. The company recently completed a clean-up project in
Pottsville, Pa., on a site when petroleum had been
distributed. Although the storage tanks were no longer
present, the site was contaminated by past seepage of
petroleum, kerosene, and bunker fuel. Enviro Haz-Tech
cleaned upthe site, which is now being developed for a
100,000 mixed-use warehouse and shopping mall project.

   For more information about the MITU system, or to inquire
about domestic and international joint ventures. Contact:

RADIATION ASSESSMENT
ARTHUR D. LITTLE IS AWARDED $7.6 MILLION
TO HELP BELARUS TACKLE DEFENSE WASTE


by Gordon Feller

   The international consulting firm Arthur D. Little has
been awarded a $7.6 million contract to help the former
Soviet republic of Belarus solve environmental problems
related to its former Strategic Rocket Forces (SRF) bases.
The two-and-a-half-year contract from the Defense Nuclear
Agency (DNA) is part of the Cooperative Threat Reduction
(CTR) Program developed under the l991 Nunn-Lugar
legislation intended to assist the countries of the former
Soviet Union in the elimination, and to prevent the
proliferation, of weapons of mass destruction.

   Arthur D. Little experts will help Belarus personnel to
assess the radiation and conventional environmental damage
at sites where intercontinental ballistic missiles were
based, transported, operated, or maintained, and help the
country restore them for other purposes. In Belarus alone,
at the height of the arms race, there were more than 80 SS-
25 missiles. Belarus has since declared itself a non-nuclear
state and wishes to return the facilities to civilian use.

   Arthur D. Little consultants will integrate a number of
different technical resources within the program to provide
training and technical assistance to the Belarus officials
and experts. The consultants will work with the Belarus
personnel to analyze the environmental problems at one
missile site and devise a restoration plan, then oversee the
Belarus technicians as they do environmental restoration
work at a second site. The ultimate goal is to transfer
enough knowledge to Belarus so that they can complete the
environmental restoration work at the remaining sites.

   Potential environmental problems include heavy metal and
low-level radioactive contaminants, spilled petroleum,
spilled liquid rocket fuel, and some minefields around the
sites' perimeters which have unexploded ordnances. As part
of the effort to transfer expertise in the environmental
restoration field, Arthur D. Little will conduct
international conferences co-sponsored by DNA and the
Belarus Ministry of Defense. Experts from around the world
will be invited to Belarus to discuss a variety of
environmental restoration experiences, technologies, and
management issues.

   As part of the CTR program, an agreement was signed in
l993 between the United States and the Republic of Belarus
to assist in development of the Environmental Restoration
Project. Other CTR projects in Belarus under Nunn-Lugar
include assistance in defense conversion, export control
systems and training, government-to-government
communications links, and emergency response equipment and
training.

   Belarus, located between Poland and Russia, has an
especially high water table and active groundwater movement,
which can exacerbate groundwater pollution. Other
organizations involved with Arthur D. Little on the
Environmental Restoration Project include the Army Corps of
Engineers Waterways Experiment Station, Los Alamos Technical
Associates, Technology Management Company, the Environmental
Chemical Corp., the Environmental Hazards Specialists
International, Environmental Careers Organizations, the
World Environment Center, and Clean Sites, Inc.

   Arthur D. Little, which conducted the largest
environmental impact assessment ever conducted in the Former
Soviet Union by a Western company, has handled more than
3,000 environmental audits and assessments in 30 countries
throughout Europe and the United States. Headquartered in
Cambridge, MA., Arthur D. Little has offices around the
world. It provides consulting in three areas: environmental,
health, and safety consulting; management consulting; and
technology and product development.

INFO FOR INVESTMENT?
RECENT EUROPEAN DEVELOPMENTS
KEY TO BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES


Russia Having Trouble With CFCs: Russia is asking for more
time to cut ozone-threatening substances. At a major
international conference of government representatives
convened in Vienna to review the 1987 Montreal Protocol on
ozone protection, Russian Federation Environment Minister
Viktor Danilov-Danilyan said Russia needs more time and a
larger pool of investment aid in order to develop
substitutes to ozone-harming substances such as
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Under the Montreal Protocol,
signed by 150 countries, such industrialized countries as
Russia are to stop producing CFCs by 1996 and the rest of
the signatories by 2010. Minister Danilov-Danilyan said the
Russian Federation is now producing only half the ozone-
threatening chemicals it was in 1987, but he added that the
drop was a by-product of the fall in industrial output. The
minister was quick to point out that he and his government
would  have  preferred  to  be able to meet the deadline, as
other governments are doing, but that the economic
conditions prevailing within his country are making it
impossible for the principal factories from even paying
their workers, let alone their taxes and electric bills. It
will be impossible for the Russian government to force such
enterprises, even if they are state-owned (and many are not)
to comply with the protocol when the ministry has no
financial capacity to support the enterprise's change-over
to non-CFC production or usage.

German, Swiss, Finnish Waste: Germany and Switzerland have
decided not to send spent nuclear fuel to Krasnoyarsk-26 for
processing, Krasnoyarsk Krai Deputy Governor Sergei Arinchin
was quoted as saying. The waste would have been processed at
the RT-2 plant - still under construction - in the formerly
secret nuclear center in Siberia. The Russian authorities
had hoped to finance the project by accepting foreign waste,
enabling them to process their own stocks. The Swiss and
German pullout will deal a major blow to the project. The
decision is likely to be hailed by environmental groups,
which have strongly opposed the importation of nuclear
materials, arguing that Russia's waste storage sites are
already overflowing. Meanwhile, a trainload of spent nuclear
fuel from a Finnish nuclear power plant reportedly has
arrived in Russia for processing at the Mayak plant in
Chelyabinsk-65. An English translation of the Komsomolskaya
Pravda newspaper says it is not yet clear whether the
nuclear residue remaining after processing will be shipped
back to Finland or kept inside the Russian Federation.

Nuclear Safety Threatened: Nuclear safety may be threatened
by workers at Russia's nuclear power plants, who say they
may shut down the facilities unless they receive overdue
wage payments. Officials say they have scheduled warning
protests, but it is not clear what form they will take.
Energy consumers owe nuclear power plants about 2.5 trillion
rubles (US$555 million), and on average workers have not
been paid for three months, according to the deputy head of
Rosenergoatom in Moscow.

German Assistance: A German company has signed a contract
with Russia's Kursk nuclear power plant to construct a
nuclear waste storage facility and to provide 240 containers
to store the plant's radioactive waste. The German Company
for Nuclear Containers, a Nukem subsidiary, will control
production quality, train specialists and provide the know-
how for production. According to Gosatomnadzor, Russia's
nuclear safety agency, the solid waste storage facilities at
the Kursk plant are full.

Troubled Kazakhstan: The amount of radioactive waste
accumulating at uranium mining and processing plants in
Kazakhstan reportedly is reaching alarming proportions.
Since this large, very poor Central Asian country became
independent in 1991, the quantity of radioactive waste
stored in Kazakhstan has grown to 219 million metric tons.
The republic's Ministry of Ecology and Biological Resources
claims the aggregate radioactivity from the waste comes to
250,000 curies, which is "many times more than the accepted
norm." Kazakhstan does not have the means to deal with the
waste because under the Soviet Union's regime disposal was a
national responsibility carried out by the government in
Moscow. Today, there are neither any Kazakh laws nor
bilateral agreements with Russia which adequately address
this type of nuclear waste disposal dilemma.

FOODSTUFFS: EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND COUNCIL AGREE ON LABELLING

from EUROPE ENVIRONMENT, 22 October 1996, No. 486

Delegations from the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers
reached a compromise on October 16 - through the Conciliation Committee -
on the labelling and advertising of foodstuffs, thus settling a row over
the proposed amendments to Directive 79/112/EEC). The Parliament claims
the agreement reflects its commitment to the principle of free trade in
the Union, as stated in the ruling by the European Court of Justice on
October 26, 1995 in the "bearnaise sauce case", and whose scope the
Council appeared anxious to limit. By contrast, negotiations between the
Parliament and Council on the labelling of novel foods have yet to be
concluded and are being pursued.

On June 15, 1995, the Council of Ministers adopted a common position on
the amendment of Articles 3 (list of requisite details for inclusion in
labelling), 6 (single ingredient foods), 7 (quantitative declaration of
ingredients), and 14 (language used on labelling) of the proposal for a
Directive. On October 25, 1995, the Schnellhardt report (EPP, Germany) was
approved in second reading by the European Parliament, which adopted five
amendments: one to Article 1 of Directive 79/112 (trade name of a food),
three to Article 6 (list of ingredients), and one amendment to Article 7
(quantitative declaration of ingredients). With the Council unwilling to
accept three of the five amendments tabled by the plenary session, the
conciliation procedure was initiated on December 22, 1995.

In its ruling on the "bearnaise sauce" case, the Court of Justice deemed
Germany to be in breach of Article 30 of the EC Treaty, which prohibits
quantitative restrictions on imports, and all measures having equivalent
effect. In Germany, the traditional recipe for bearnaise sauce is based on
butter and eggs. The authorities demanded that imported sauces
manufactured according to a different recipe should bear the mention
"bearnaise sauce made from vegetable oil" and not the generic name
"bearnaise sauce". The Court ruled that Germany has no right to demand
such an indication on labelling of the product, as the term "bearnaise
sauce" is quite sufficient.

The joint text to emerge from the conciliation talks provides for a
product to be sold in other Member States under the legal name it carries
in the Member State of production - except in very exceptional cases. The
compromise takes account of pressure from certain Member States following
the "bearnaise sauce" ruling, by stipulating that the trade name can be
complemented by additional information printed adjacently. On the express
demand of the European Parliament delegation, these provisions are however
included under certain conditions: the list of ingredients (and other
provisions of the Directive) must not prevent consumers in the Member
State where a product is marketed from determining the real nature of the
food, and there must be no risk of confusion with other products.

MEPs believe this provision will have little impact in practice, as the
"bearnaise sauce" ruling clearly indicates that a list of ingredients
should be sufficient to prevent any confusion on the part of the consumer.
Moreover, the text of the Treaty must take precedence over secondary
legislation.

In respect of people suffering from allergies, the Parliament secured
Council approval for clear labelling of the specific vegetable origin of
starches entering into the composition of products and likely to contain
gluten.

It now remains for the two institutions to formally adopt this compromise,
the Council by qualified majority, the European Parliament by a simple
majority. However, the Parliament's delegation emphasised that it will not
recommend its adoption by the plenary session unless the European
Commission pledges to bring forward a specific proposal on the labelling
of alcoholic beverages, which are not covered by the present Directive.

Novel foods.

Are novel foods (a term covering genetically-modified products: soya
beans, sugar beet, flavour-saver tomatoes, etc.) different from
traditional foods and if so, to what extent? This question fuelled a first
exchange of views between delegations from the European Parliament and the
Council on October 16 at the Conciliation Committee.

Parliament is demanding that food labels should inform consumers of all
the characteristics and properties that distinguish a novel food or food
ingredient from an existing equivalent food or ingredient. The Council of
Ministers believes such information is only justified where there is a
"significant" difference with the traditional food.

The Conciliation Committee will have to settle the issue and, under the
context of co-decision procedure, draw up a compromise text for a proposal
for a Regulation on the marketing in the Community of novel foods and food
ingredients. In second reading on March 12, 1995, the European Parliament
adopted six amendments to the common position approved by the Council on
October 23, 1995. Compromise proposals are currently being examined and
the delegations may reach an agreement in the coming weeks.

This Regulation must guarantee that novel foods and food ingredients
present no risk to public health or the environment and are the object of
detailed labelling. It will also define procedures on the European level
for the marketing of these products throughout the Community. It says that
genetic engineering must only be used to improve the taste, flavour and
shelf life of products, or to protect against insect attack or ensure
resistance to herbicides.

DEREGULATING PUBLIC SERVICES IN THE INTEREST OF CONSUMERS.

from EUROPE ENVIRONMENT, 22 October 1996, No. 486

Just as France was reaffirming the importance of the inclusion of public
services in the Maastricht Treaty, at the European Council in Dublin on
October 5, Rome was hosting an International Forum on "the deregulation of
public and consumer services", organised on the initiative of the European
Commission and Italy's competition and markets authority. Following on
from its recent Communication on general interest services in Europe, the
Commission was anxious to relaunch the deregulation debate by emphasising
European citizens' interests (and expectations), in the presence of
representatives of institutions, industry, utilities and consumer
associations. Faced with the reticence of certain Member States and
sectors concerned, the Commission has put its faith in the
citizen-consumer to support the ongoing process. But the man in the street
still has to be convinced of the advantages to be gained from deregulating
public services, and reassured of the maintenance of "unalienable" general
interest services. The Rome meeting was intended at a first step towards
this goal.

CRESSON PUTS CASE FOR BETTER FOCUSED RESEARCH PROGRAMME

from EUROPE ENVIRONMENT, 22 October 1996, No. 486

Addressing a gathering at the University of Bonn, in Germany, on October
16, Edith Cresson, the European Commissioner with responsibility for
Research, argued that the 5th European Framework Programme on Research and
Technological Development (RTD) (1999-2002) must not be a mere extension
of its predecessors. The Commissioner emphasised the importance of
evolving away from research focusing exclusively on technological
performance, and towards research focusing better on economic and social
needs. The Commission guidelines for the 5th Framework Programme were
presented in September in the form of a working paper ("Inventing
tomorrow") designed to launch the debate.

Mrs Cresson highlighted her own creed on European research policy which
should, first and foremost, serve the needs of society. She insisted this
goal is not at variance with the need for strong basic research in Europe:
contemporary research is indeed characterised by an increasingly rapid
convergence of theoretical breakthroughs and practical results.

Turning to the place of research/industry Task Forces in the 5th Framework
Programme, Mrs Cresson indicated they should in principle remain as
support structures for projects targeted at themes of great social and
economic importance. She also highlighted the relations between RTD
policy, regional and cohesion policy, an issue of much concern in Germany,
insisting that "while Union research actions can contribute directly to
strengthening the economic and social cohesion of different regions,
seeking to obtain this effect by sacrificing the criteria of scientific
excellence would be a grave error". It would, she argues, be more
appropriate to "coordinate the implementation of research programmes and
regional policy actions".

The European Commissioner recalled the timetable for the introduction of
the 5th Framework Programme:

- The Commission will present a more detailed working paper before the
year's end, describing in greater depth the scientific and technological
objectives to be pursued and the procedures for implementation; this
document will however remain sufficiently open to stimulate a genuine
policy debate on the options proposed.

- A formal proposal will be presented at the beginning of 1997, with a
view to its adoption at the beginning of 1998.

STEEL CANS RECYCLING RATE EXCEEDS 40%

from EUROPE ENVIRONMENT, 22 October 1996, No. 486

The recycling rate for steel cans in Europe reached 41% in 1995, an
increase of more than 20% in just one year, according to APEAL, the
Association of European Packaging Steel Producers. This puts the industry
well above the target of 15% for all materials set out in the Directive on
packaging and packaging wastes. The Association claims that about a
million tonnes of steel were collected and recycled last year. Germany is
setting the trend in Europe with a recycling rate of 67%, followed by the
Netherlands (58%), France (40%) and Belgium (30%). Spain and Britain are
trailing somewhat with 17 and 16% respectively. APEAL forecasts that
recycling rates will reach 65% by 2005. In Europe, food tins account for
50% of steel packaging, industrial packaging such as drums for 20%,
beverage cans 10%, aerosols 10%, and other objects 5%.

The members of APEAL are: the British Steel Tinplate (GB), Cockerill
Sambre (B), Corporacion Siderurgica Nacional (Sp), Hoogovens Packaging
Steel (Nl), ICMI (I), Norsk Blikkvalseverk (N), Rasselstein Hoesch (Ger),
Sollac (F).

EIB LENDS TURKEY ECU 50 MILLION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.

from EUROPE ENVIRONMENT, 22 October 1996, No. 486

The European Investment Bank is lending ECU 50 million for an
environmental protection project in Turkey. The loan is being advanced to
Izmit Greater Municipality to help cover the cost of collection and
treatment of industrial effluents in the province of Kocaeli, one of the
most industrialised provinces in Turkey. The project will halt the
contamination of local rivers and thereby will help to protect and improve
water quality in the Gulf of Izmit (Marmara Sea). Financing is granted
under the environmental section of the "Off-Protocol Facility", benefiting
from a 3% interest subsidy from the Community Budget, under the EU's
Redirected Mediterranean Policy, designed to support investment in the
fields of regional cooperation and environment protection, developing
links at regional levels and with the Union's economy.

INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL OF THE SEA INVESTS JUDGES.

from EUROPE ENVIRONMENT, 22 October 1996, No. 486

The investiture of the 21 judges who are to sit on the International
Tribunal of the Sea, a United Nations institution set up to arbitrate
disputes over fishing, navigation and pollution, was held in the German
town of Hamburg on October 18. The ceremony was attended by UN
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who called on more countries to
sign the Tribunal's Charter. Notable exceptions include the United States
and Britain, while France and Russia have still to ratify the document.
The basis for the Tribunal's work, the Agreement on the Law of the Sea has
thus far been signed by 107 of the UN's 185 member countries. Mr
Boutros-Ghali explained that the Tribunal will be charged with
implementing provisional measures where the marine environment is
seriously threatened, and should lead to a more rapid resolution of
disputes over fisheries, navigation and pollution. It will also have the
power to order the release of impounded vessels, against the deposit of a
guarantee. The Tribunal's rulings will not be subject to appeal. Where
disputes arise, States will be free to appeal either to the Tribunal or to
the International Court of Justice in the Hague. The Tribunal is chaired
by Thomas Mensah of Ghana.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT: MAKING A COME-BACK

from EUROPE ENVIRONMENT, 22 October 1996, No. 486

The European Commission is said to be pondering the idea of resuscitating
a proposal that has been deeply buried for several years now and seeks to
ensure that the environment is taken into account at the start of the
decision-making chain. European Commissioner for the Environment Ritt
Bjerregaard is inciting her colleagues to adopt the draft environmental
impact assessment Directive for the policies, plans and programmes of the
Member States. It is scheduled to appear on the provisional agenda for the
Commissioners' October 30 meeting. The existing Directive on the
environmental impact assessment of public and private projects proposes an
impact assessment much further up the political decision-making chain. Mrs
Bjerregaard's new Directive is intended to ensure the Member States'
programmes and strategies are effectively vetted for their environmental
impact. Green MEPs and environmental protection lobbies have accused the
Commission of holding up the proposal, pending a decision on the major
trans-European transport networks, which they claim would by their very
nature contravene the proposal.

CHEMICAL INDUSTRY: COMMISSION RIGHT TO REFUSE CFC IMPORT LICENCE, SAYS
COURT

from EUROPE ENVIRONMENT, 22 October 1996, No. 486

In an October 16 ruling, the Court of First Instance of the European
Communities dismissed an appeal by Efisol of France against the European
Commission's refusal to grant it a licence to import chlorofluorocarbons
11 (CFC 11) in 1994. After obtaining an import quota of 1,800 tonnes of
CFCs for 1994, Efisol expected the Commission to grant it an import
licence as is usual following attribution of a quota. The Commission
declined to do so. Efisol, meanwhile, had already ordered and transported
some of the CFCs in question at a cost of over two million French Francs.
The Court found that Efisol had acted unwisely, but admitted that the
Commission had not acted entirely correctly either.

Under Regulation 594/91, trade within the EU of CFCs imported from third
countries is subject to quotas granted by the Commission to the firms in
question (CFCs are now banned in the EU). The quota, however, must be
supplemented by an import licence granted by the Commission for CFCs to be
imported. A firm desiring a licence must submit an application to the
Commission describing the substances it wishes to import, the quantity and
the use to which they will be put. The various possible uses provided for
on the application form include "feedstock in the manufacture of other
chemicals".

After an exchange of letters between Efisol and the Commission, the French
company indicated that the CFCs to be imported would be used as "feedstock
in the manufacture of other chemicals", specifically polyurethane foam.
The Commission did not react rapidly enough to the provision of what was
later found to be inaccurate or even erroneous information by Efisol. CFCs
are not completely destroyed or broken down during the manufacture of
polyurethane foam and therefore this process does not meet the definition
of the "manufacture of other chemicals". It was the French Ministry that
informed the Commission that the imported CFCs would not be used to
produce other chemicals.

Efisol placed orders with its Russian suppliers on February 17 and 20,
1994, only a few days after submitting its application for a licence on
February 15 and before it had received a response. On February 24, the
Commission informed Efisol of its refusal to grant the import licences.
One train was already rolling towards France carrying a cargo of CFCs 11
and another was headed for Russia to pick up another load. When informal
negotiations failed, Efisol demanded compensation for the costs of
transporting the first load and running the empty train and for lost
production and sales. The Commission claimed that Efisol had "attempted to
mislead the Commission as to the exact use to which the substances were to
be put" and had "purchased orders from its Russian supplier (...) before
the Commission denied the application for the licence". The parties are
also at loggerheads over the issue of whether a licence should
automatically be granted following the attribution of a quota. The
Commission considered the two separate actions.

The Court found against Efisol, which claimed that the Commission had
violated the principle of legitimate expectations, arguing that once the
quota had been allocated, the Commission was required to issue a licence.
The Court said that a "cautious and informed operator would not have
initiated rail transport of the cargoes ordered without waiting for the
Commission's decision and without taking the necessary steps to protect
its interests if its application for a licence was refused". The import
rights granted with the attribution of a quota become effective only when
the import licence is granted, the Court said. By placing orders only two
days after applying for a licence, the "the complainant put itself in
danger". The Court further ruled that it is scientifically inaccurate to
describe polyurethane foam as a "chemical". However, the Commission
"applied Community Regulations incorrectly" by granting Efisol a quota for
this type of use, the Court said. "The Commission's behaviour was not in
keeping with Community Regulations and thus could not have raised
justified hopes on the part of the complainant". Since "the emergence of
conflict was fuelled by the Commission's action", the Commission was
ordered to pay all the legal costs.

Calif. operators push environmental plan

     Western States Petroleum Assn. has unveiled a
blueprint for California's Kern County that may enable
oil and gas producers, environmentalists, endangered
plants and animals, and county, state and federal
government officials to co-exist peacefully and
beneficially.
     The specifics of the plan are contained in a WSPA
"white paper" designed to be consistent with the
protection of endangered species outlined in a 1989
memorandum of understanding among Kern County,
the California Fish & Game Dept.'s oil, gas and
geothermal division and the federal Fish & Wildlife
Service and Bureau of Land Management.
     "It's a great first step," said WSPA's Mike
Emanuel, of the white paper's chances of leading
toward an agreement among the parties involved.
     Other principles guiding development of the paper
included meeting requirements of the federal and
California endangered species acts while allowing for
economic growth and development in Kern County;
providing a reliable process for landowners to
compensate for or mitigate impacts on sensitive
species; and distributing the conservation burden
broadly and fairly among public and private
landowners, based on the impact of their activities on
sensitive species.
     A look at the makeup of Kern County's
environment makes clear the need for some kind of
coordinating plan. Oil fields in the county account for
about 592,000 b/d, or two out of every three barrels
produced in California. Kern County blankets the
southern end of the San Joaquin Valley, which was
recently described in a guide book as follows: "No
national park, no recreation area, no wildlife refuge
anywhere in the contiguous 48 states has a wider
variety of rare and endangered birds, animals and plant
life than can be found in the southern San Joaquin
Valley."
     WSPA's paper calls for providing incentives for
preservation and development to occur in patterns that
preserve large, connected blocks of highly valued
habitat. The plan would divide the valley floor into four
zones, including three for which compensation for
development would be required and a fourth in which
no compensation would be required because of the
absence of valuable habitat.
     The latter area, a "gray zone," represents heavily
disturbed areas that do not fit into the overall
conservation strategy, such as oil fields with well
spacing of four acres or less.
     Compensation for other zones would be based on a
ratio no greater than 3-to-1, which would be used to
calculate the level of compensation required.
Compensation for development within the three zones
would be in the form of credits generated by the
permanent preservation of habitat, granting of
conservation easements or other specified measures.
     Red, green and white zones would be used to
determine the habitat value of any parcel within the
plan area in terms of habitat units (h.u.).
     Three habitat units per acre would be offered for a
red zone, the lands of highest value for conservation
purposes; two units for a green zone, land less
important than a red zone but still valuable for
conservation purposes, particularly to provide
connectivity across the reserve system; and one habitat
unit for a white zone, covering a large area with widely
varying, but typically low, biological values that could
not contribute significantly to long-term conservation
strategy.
     White zone lands generally would not be available
for compensation.
     A formula would be adopted for adjusting habitat
unit values based on consideration of connectivity with
other habitat. Landowners would receive transferable
habitat unit credits for granting land for preservation
purposes or taking other specified conservation
actions.
     A monitoring plan would be established, creating
the ability to adjust the valley floor habitat conservation
plan over time as necessary to meet conservation
goals.
     Landowners who preserve habitat would receive
credits based on the habitat unit value of the land
preserved, and owners who disturb habitat would
compensate based on the habitat unit value of the area
disturbed at the compensation ratio.
     If the ratio is 3-to-1, compensation for taking in
each of the three zones would be as follows:

     ** Red zone (worth 3 h.u./acre) -- Compensate
with 9 h.u./acre of impact, which could be done with
either 3 acres in the red zone or 4.5 acres in the green
zone.
     ** Green zone (worth 2 h.u./acre) -- Compensate
with 6 h.u./acre of impact, which could be either 2
acres in the red zone or 3 acres in the green zone.
     ** White zone (worth 1 h.u./acre) -- Compensate
with 3 h.u./acre of impact, which could be done with
either 1 acre in the red zone or 1.5 acres in the green
zone.

     While the approach doesn't place an absolute cap on
development in any one zone, it effectively would cap
the total loss of habitat value at 25%, because at a 3-to-
1 compensation ratio, 75% of the habitat value would
be protected from development.
     The approach based on habitat value would provide
a more meaningful conservation than one based on
acreage, according to WSPA, because the habitat value
measure provides strong incentives to compensate in
large, connected areas of highly valued habitat, as well
as strong disincentives to disturb those areas.
     The plan also recognizes habitat that is restored to
an established standard. If an oil field is restored to the
established standard after abandonment, thereby
undoing a habitat disturbance for which habitat credits
were previously provided as compensation, the
landowner could reuse those credits.
     Among conservation advantages claimed for the
approach are providing incentives that will result in a
very high percentage of habitat preserved in the most
sensitive areas, strong positive incentives to restore
land to native habitat after it has been put to a
temporary industrial use such as oil operations, and
strong incentives for habitat to be preserved in large,
connected configurations.
     Among economic advantages claimed for the plan
are providing both large and small landowners a timely
and predictable means of obtaining value for high-
value habitat on their property; a timely, predictable
and flexible means of compensating for habitat loss
with minimal costly survey requirements; a certain
equity among landowners with lands of different
habitat quality; and ways for landowners to minimize
their compensation requirements over time by doing a
good job of cleaning up after themselves by restoring
land to native habitat.

Enviros face united front in badlands battle

     An unlikely coalition of oil and gas producers,
ranchers, business people, politicians, and Indians have
joined forces in North Dakota to oppose a plan to turn
a huge chunk of the state's western badlands into a
wilderness preserve.
     At issue is a proposal by wildlife and
environmental groups spearheaded by the Sierra Club
that Congress declare 191,000 acres in the state as a
wilderness area. Eighty-two percent of that lies in the
Little Missouri National Grasslands area of the
badlands. The remaining acreage is in the Sheyenne
Grasslands near Lisbon, N.D., and the J. Clark Salyer
National Wildlife Refuge in McHenry and Bottineau
counties.
     The proposal, detailed in the environmental groups'
publication "Badlands on the Brink," would allow
hunting, hiking, camping and livestock grazing, but
would ban further oil and gas development. Motorized
vehicles would be banned except for ranchers making
repairs and improvements.
     More than 100 opponents of the plan got together
last week in Dickinson, N.D., to talk strategy. They are
worried that strict preservation will damage oil and
cattle businesses and eventually doom Dickinson and
other, smaller towns in that part of the state.
     The proposal was dealt a blow at the meeting when
the Three Affiliated Tribes, a Native American group
listed by the Sierra Club as a sponsor of the plan,
withdrew its support and said it will cancel its Sierra
Club membership.
     "It's going to take a lot of the economic
development away from the tribe, and oil development
and cattle ranching," said tribal Vice Chairman Ivan
Johnson. He said the tribe didn't know it was listed as
a sponsor for the wilderness proposal until tribal
officials started fielding calls from area ranchers.
     County, city and school boards in the western
section of North Dakota depend on taxes from oil and
gas revenues to fund their budgets. Five counties
would be affected by the wilderness plan. For the state,
oil tax revenues made up 10% of the 1989-91 general
fund budget.
     Mike Armstrong of Dickinson, an independent oil
producer, said at the meeting it's natural for oil and gas
operators and ranchers to join forces. "We need to
protect the resources they're trying to take from our
state. All this land is open to public use now, except
the private land."
     Those at the meeting decided to start a letter-writing
campaign to the state's congressional delegation and
advocated "arm twisting" North Dakota Gov. Ed
Schafer to join their cause.
     The group -- which still needs a name -- will form a
working association of ranchers, oil and gas producers,
businesses and government officials. They plan to
compile resolutions from groups opposed to the plan,
gather economic impact statistics and print a brochure
defending badlands development.
     Alice Benitiz, lands director for the Rocky
Mountain Oil & Gas Assn., attended the meeting and
told E&PE the Sierra Club's push to have the
grasslands designated as a wilderness area smacked of
"sour grapes."
     Benitiz said, "The badlands and other areas of
North Dakota have been studied for almost 20 years
by the U.S. Forest Service to determine their suitability
as wilderness areas." And each time, she said, the
agency had decided the region could not be managed
as wilderness because of the level of development and
importance of oil and gas production and ranching to
surrounding communities.
     "The environmental groups have failed through the
very public process in which they were involved to get
the Forest Service to halt oil and gas activity," she said.
"And this mechanism [legislation] is the only way they
have left."

NRC touts 'super' environmental agency

     The National Research Council has proposed in a
report due out later this summer that the U.S. make
sweeping and fundamental changes in the way it
handles environmental problems.
     Entitled Research to Protect, Restore and Manage
the Environment, the 241-page study takes dead aim at
the way the federal government conducts
environmental research. Existing programs are poorly
structured, uncoordinated and hampered by the lack of
clear leadership at the highest levels of government, the
NRC report said.
     NRC recommended establishment of a national
environmental council, chaired by the vice president,
composed of the heads of the federal environmental
agencies, and aided by advisory committees made up
of representatives from the scientific community, the
public, state government, and the private sector.
     The council would provide leadership and
coordination among federal agencies for environmental
research and oversee implementation of a national plan
to identify a research agenda and the responsibilities of
individual agencies.
     NRC also proposed the creation of an
environmental assessment center to convey policy
options to the national environmental council,
Congress and the involved parties. If the U.S. is to
make major improvements in the quality of its
environmental research and policy programs, NRC
said EPA has to be elevated to cabinet status with the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin., the U.S.
Geological Survey and parts of NASA becoming part
of a Dept. of the Environment.
     Washington distributes about $5 billion annually to
more than 20 federal agencies for environmental
research. But, NRC points out, there "is no
comprehensive national environmental research plan to
coordinate the efforts" of the agencies.
     "Moreover, no agency has the mission to develop
such a plan, nor is any existing agency able to
coordinate and oversee a national environmental
research plan if one were designed," the report adds.
     Science and engineering "have the tools to address
environmental problems of enormous consequence to
our social and economic well being," the study said.
"But we aren't using those tools most effectively."
     Bridges between policy, management and science
are weak, the report said. And there is no organized
system to communicate assessments of environmental
problems to decision-makers and policy-setters.
     To order a copy of the report, contact the National
Academy Press at 800-624-6242.

Emissions-control process patented

     Radian Corp. and the Gas Research Institute have
completed work on an emissions-control process for
triethylene glycol dehydrators that maximizes
emissions recovery while retaining hydrocarbons for
resale.
     The process, know as Recovery-BTEX, or R- BTEX,
was developed by Radian as part of research on glycol
dehydrators sponsored by GRI. Radian's Phil Lowell
recently patented the process (U.S. Patent No.
5,209,762); the patent rights have been assigned to GRI.
     R-BTEX addresses the issue that all natural gas,
whether it's produced directly from the source
formation or from a storage reservoir, contains some
water that must be removed to prevent hydrate
formation and minimize corrosion during
transmission. Glycol dehydrators remove water from
the gas stream, but in the process also remove some
volatile organic compounds (VOCs); among them are
benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and xylene, collectively
known as BTEX.
     When glycol is regenerated, absorbed water is
boiled off along with the volatile hydrocarbons,
including BTEX, and released into the atmosphere.
     In 1989, Louisiana's Environmental Quality Dept.
spearheaded an effort to quantify the amount of BTEX
and other VOCs released from glycol dehydrators. The
department surveyed more than 200 glycol
dehydrators processing at least 5 mmcf/day of natural
gas that were operated by producing, processing,
pipeline and storage companies.
     The study found that levels of BTEX and other
VOCs from glycol units were high enough to be a
concern for the industry. There are an estimated 30,000
glycol dehydrators in use in the U.S. The Clean Air
Act has potentially wide-ranging consequences for
glycol units because BTEX are included in the list of
189 air toxic pollutants and may be emitted at levels
that would cause many glycol units to be defined as
major sources.
     If so, the units would be required to use and
comply with the maximum achievable control
technology (MACT) standards. And while MACT
technologies are considered state-of-the-art and
efficient, industry contends they are not necessarily
designed to be cost-effective.
     Radian's process is based on the established
technologies of stripping, condensation and phase
separation. GRI says R-BTEX provides a cost-
effective alternative for controlling BTEX emissions.
R-BTEX is designed for new or retrofit applications.
     Since the water recovered from the gas is used as
the coolant, the process operates at condenser
temperatures below those reached using air cooling.
And in most cases, that makes possible a 95%
recovery of hydrocarbons as saleable liquids. R-BTEX
can control BTEX emissions by as much as 99.9% if
vented BTEX is controlled at the condenser vent and
flash tank.
     Researchers said the blowdown water from the R-
BTEX cooling tower has a very low concentration of
dissolved organics and can sometimes be directly
discharged without further treatment.
     Two tests were conducted last year using two gas-
processing scenarios to evaluate the effect of gas
pressure, BTEX concentration, glycol recirculation
rate, and reboiler temperature on process performance.
For each test, the production rate was 75 mcf/day of
gas.
     One test was conducted in a high-pressure field of
900 psi with gas containing 750 ppm BTEX. The
other was carried out in a lower pressure field of 400
psi with gas containing 300 BTEX.
     In the first case, researchers recovered 9.2 b/d of
BTEX with emissions of 0.78 lbs/day. In the second
test, 7.4 b/d were removed with emissions of 0.63
lbs/day of BTEX.

Indiana considers bird netting rules

     The Indiana Natural Resources Dept. is drawing up
regulations for mandatory covers on drilling and
production reserve pits.
     Sparking the movement is an incident that occurred
this spring north of Princeton, Ind., in Gibson County.
Two wood ducks were pulled from a pit by officials
from the department and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service. The ducks later died.
     Their deaths spurred a criminal inquiry and received
widespread publicity in the Illinois Basin. The incident
was also discussed at last month's meeting of the
Independent Petroleum Assn. of America in
Washington.
     Migratory birds and other wildlife are protected by
federal laws under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and
the Endangered Species Act. But Jim Slutz, head of
the department's Oil and Gas Division, said it is often
up to the individual state to enforce the oil industry's
compliance with regulations.
     He promised strong action in this and other reserve
pit events in Indiana, including steep fines and civil and
criminal charges. Federal violations also carry stiff
penalties and fines.
     To date, oilfield operations in the Midwest and
Appalachian states have dodged the bird netting
controversy. But state legislation requiring netting on
reserve pits is also being considered in Illinois and
Kentucky, said Craig Howard, president of the
Independent Oil Producers Assn., Tri-State.
     "A lot of attention is being given to the Endangered
Species Act and the necessity to prevent entry into
pits," he said. "It has become a serious issue, even
though the Gibson county incident is the only one to
receive publicity during the past 40 years."
     Department officials have begun to inspect more
reserve pits around the state, looking for violations.
Howard said some Illinois Basin producers have
begun to install bird netting, or are using storage tanks
to recycle drilling fluids or hold produced water to be
in compliance with federal laws or any state laws that
may be forthcoming.

ERCB calls for drilling waste management

     Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board
has directed provincial oil and gas operators to submit
a waste disposal plan with well license applications
when hydrocarbon- or salt-based mud will be used or
produced during drilling.
     Re-entry situations that use an oil- or salt-base
drilling fluid system but don't need a well license
application require a waste disposal plan. Producers
will also have to retain the plan in their files because it
will be needed when they apply for a reclamation
certificate afterward.
     The plan must indicate the type of hydrocarbon or
salt used in the mud, estimated volume of drilling
waste to be generated, any additives, additional
treatment processes used such as incineration or reuse,
equipment used to reduce soil contamination and waste
volume and method of handling completion fluids.
     If an operator intends to use landfarming to dispose
of waste, the plan must provide a location and general
description of the site indicating:

     ** Estimated oil content is resulting soil mix (if oil-
        based).
     ** Present land use, topography, vegetation type,
        soil horizon used for disposal, topsoil depth, and size
        of disposal area.
     ** Measures used to contain surface and subsurface
        migration of contaminants.
     ** Procedures, timing and frequency of the
        landfarming operation and depth of initial
        incorporation into the soil.
     ** Schedule for any waste-soil mixture cultivation
        or tilling.
     ** Type of soil amendments which may be used to
        promote biodegradation.
     ** Analytical tests and sampling locations which
        will be used to determine initial soil-waste quality, and
        to monitor hydrocarbon degradation and salt levels.
     ** Time required to complete the landfarming
        procedure and the criteria used to determine when
        completion reached.
     ** Proximity to residents other than the landowner.
     ** Name and telephone number of person
        responsible for the disposal operation.

     If the well is to be located on public land, the waste
disposal plan will be reviewed by either the Agriculture
Dept.; Food, and Rural Development; or the
Environmental Protection Dept. The plan for wells
drilled on private land will be reviewed by ERCB's
Environment Protection Dept. The plan must be
approved before the operator can spud the well.
     According to ERCB, the purpose of the plan is to
make sure the operator "has considered the long-term
soil reclamation steps required when producing a
particular waste type," and to determine where and
how these treatments are being used in the province.

DOE seeks input to production strategy

     The Energy Dept. is asking for input from oil and
gas producers as it prepares a domestic oil and gas
initiative to create jobs and increase domestic
production while protecting the environment.
     Speaking at a recent oil and gas waste management
seminar sponsored by the Independent Oil & Gas
Assn. of Pennsylvania, Nancy Johnson, a DOE
program manager for environmental research and
analysis, urged operators to comment on the initiative.
     DOE Secretary Hazel O'Leary announced the
project in April; the agency hopes to complete its draft
strategy for submission to President Clinton by Labor
Day.
     Johnson acknowledged oil and gas operators face
increasing environmental costs and liabilities
stemming from a constant flow of new and more
complex regulations. She stressed the importance of
basing policy analysis on cumulative regulatory
impact.
     For example, a DOE study determined the
industrial waste provisions proposed in a Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act bill last year would
have resulted in a 9% decrease in oil reserves, a 3%
decrease in gas reserves, the loss of 13,000 exploration
and production jobs, a $27 billion decrease in federal
and state tax revenues and would cost industry $40
billion initially plus $5 billion annually for compliance.
     Johnson said DOE wants to hear from industry
what it considers priority concerns, regional issues,
research needs, and innovative ideas for problem
solving through federal, state and industry co-
operation.
     Meanwhile, about three-quarters of DOE's
requested $101 million for natural gas programs is
aimed at utilizing fuel cells ($50 million), advanced
turbines ($24 million) and other uses ($5 million).
Also proposed is some $17 million for resource and
extraction programs, $3.4 million for delivery and
storage, and $2.9 million for environmental research
and analysis.
     The proposed $80 million petroleum budget targets
$70 million for oil recovery programs and $3.6 million
for environmental research and analysis.
     Comments for the domestic oil and gas strategy
should be directed to Len Coburn, Office of Oil and
Natural Gas Policy (EP-52); or Donald Juckett, Office
of Fossil Energy (FE-30), Dept. of Energy, 1000
Independence Ave. SW, Washington, D.C. 20585.

Twenty-five operators fined $130,800

     The Texas Railroad Commission racked up another
$130,800 in fines over the last two weeks as it charged
25 oil and gas operators with violations of commission
well plugging and pollution rules.
     So far in 1993, the commission has levied
$1,312,401.32 in fines, compared to only $543,666 in
such penalties assessed during the same period last
year.
     The following operators were fined for single well
violations: Atlantic & Gulf Pet Corp. of Houston
($3,000), Hash Oil Co. of Albany ($3,000), RCB
Record Co. of San Antonio ($3,000), Kevin Franks
Enterprises of Morton ($3,000), Seagull Resources of
Calgary, Alberta ($3,500), and Trinity Valley Oil &
Equipment of Houston ($3,000).
     Two companies were cited for two-well violations.
Sonora Oil Co. of Rockwall was ordered to pay
$3,000, and Global Energy & Minerals of Houston
was penalized $5,000.
     Dohn Operating of Ganado was fined $20,000 for
four inactive and unplugged wells; Red River
Hydrocarbons of Scottsdale, Ariz. was assessed
$9,000 for four wells; and Gene Creswell of Graham
was assessed $15,000 for five wells.
     In addition, M-P Petroleum Inc. of Houston was
ordered to pay $3,500 for discharges of oil and gas
wastes; Deryl G. Bolin of Carrizo Springs was fined
$1,500 for an unplugged well and for an oil spill;
Diamond S Operating of Livingston was ordered to
pay $4,000 for an unplugged well and for failing to
backfill pits; Kana Resources of Snyder was assessed
$6,000 for oil and saltwater discharges; and
Goldenwest Oil Co. of Olney was fined $24,500 for
10 inactive and unplugged wells and for oil and
saltwater discharges.
     Nine operators agreed to pay a penalty without
admitting any violation of commission rules. Claude
Robinson Oil & Gas of Borger was assessed $800 for
eight unplugged wells; Keystone Operating Co. of
Alice was penalized $1,500 for four wells; Lorac Inc.
of Dallas was ordered to pay $1,500 for one well;
Hillin-Simon Oil Co. of Midland was assessed $3,000
for injection without a permit; Robert C. Wash of Big
Spring was penalized $1,000 for a basic sediment spill
at a former tank battery; S.E. Brown Trustee of Alice
was ordered to pay $9,000 for failure to backfill pits
and for injection without a permit; Sandco Oil & Gas
of Lafayette, La., was assessed $500 for one inactive
and unplugged well; K&F Oil & Gas Management of
Kilgore was penalized $3,000 for an oil and saltwater
spill; and Impact Energy of Kerrville was ordered to
pay $500 for an unplugged well.

SVE leads in EPA market survey

     An EPA report coming out soon projects the
volume of contaminated soil amenable to soil vapor
extraction at 2 1/2 times the amount that could be
subjected to in situ bioremediation.
     Soil vapor extraction has been used in 17% of
cleanup treatment remedies applied so far but is still
considered innovative because information on meeting
cleanup targets is hard to get. It's a lot easier to track
what's been removed than what's left behind.
     So said Walter Kovalick, head of EPA's 4-year-old
Technology Innovation Office in Superfund and an
acting deputy administrator for solid waste and
emergency response. He described the new report last
week at a conference in St. Paul, Minn. The report, 2
1/2 years in the making, projects market share in
volumes of soil to be treated by various innovative
technologies during the next five to eight years.
     For example, the soil vacuum extraction (SVE)
market was put at 3.2 million cubic yards, in situ
bioremediation at 1.2 million cubic yards, in situ soil
flushing at 980,000 cubic yards, and soil washing at
840,000 cubic yards. Kovalick said bioremediation has
been lagging, while soil flushing and soil washing
have been moving up.
     The market survey focuses on 550 sites at the
remedial design stage and 738 that are going through
the remedial investigation and feasibility study process.
     Contamination volumes were aggregated from sites
in various cleanup programs: Superfund, 1,600 to
2,000 sites (including 400 to 800 in the discovery or
listing part of the process); RCRA corrective action,
3,500; underground storage tanks, 295,000; Defense
Dept., 7,313; Energy Dept., 4,000; other federal
agencies, 350.
     Although no information was available on the
number of state sites, Kovalick said states had spent
$428 million and have cleanup fund balances of $2.2
billion.
accounted for 61% of thermal treatments.
     The report, Cleaning Up the Nation's Waste Sites:
Markets and Technical Trends, No. PB93-140762, will
be available from the National Technical Information
Service, 703-487-4650. T

OSPRA audits on schedule

     The Texas General Land Office says it has
completed about half its audits of coastal facilities that
have submitted oil spill contingency plans required by
the state's 1991 Oil Spill Prevention and Response Act
(OSPRA).
     GLO began the series of random audits in January
and to date its 22 inspectors have examined some 300
of the 600 oil-handling facilities scattered along the
Texas coastline from Louisiana to Mexico, including
production sites.
     Timothy McKinna, who is in charge of the land
office's spill division, said the random audits will likely
be completed by the end of August. He told E&PE
about 100 facilities have passed inspection and been
certified by the agency; the remainder are in the
process of making changes to their plans to bring them
into line.
     McKinna said companies' compliance with the
requirements of OSPRA has improved as the audits
have progressed. "When we began random on-site
audits in January, we discovered a variety of problems
that made plans that looked good on paper unworkable
in reality," he said. "Some of the plans were so
cumbersome that personnel would never have the
inclination to study them, much less understand them."
     If an operator doesn't have a workable contingency
plan in place, the way in which the land office conducts
the audits doesn't provide much opportunity to cobble
one together. GLO auditors normally give an operator
only about an hour's notice that they're coming to
conduct the inspection.

Correction

     In the May 14 issue, E&PE incorrectly stated
Colorado surface owners were asking that the state Oil
and Gas Conservation Commission raise the surface
damage bond of Gerrity Oil & Gas Corp.       Instead,
the case involved wells being drilled by Elk
Exploration. Gerrity has no applications pending for a
surface damage bond increase before the commission.
     The case was heard in part at the commission's
April meeting and continued until its June hearing.
After more than 10 hours of hearings, the commission
recommended a bond in the amount of $15,250
(E&PE 6/11).
     Covering three wells, the per well bond amount is
$5,083, or $83 more than the standard $5,000 required
for a single well by the commission's rules.

Controversial well draws ire

     The comment period for a Bureau of Land
Management draft environmental impact statement
favorable to the drilling of a controversial proposed
exploratory well in South Florida has been extended 90
days to Aug. 18.
     Shell Oil wants to drill a 18,850-foot directional
wildcat on the Miccosukee Indian reservation under the
everglades in Broward County.
     The project has drawn the fire of environmentalists
and state and local officials because the Biscayne
aquifer, the region's main underground water supply,
begins within five miles of the proposed well. Shell
says the well will not affect the aquifer, but
environmentalists maintain it will.
     The Florida Legislature and South Florida Water
Management Board have passed resolutions calling on
both the BLM and Bureau of Indian Affairs, the two
federal agencies charged with reviewing and approving
the EIS, to kill the plan. In addition, Broward County
commissioners passed a resolution threatening a
lawsuit if the well is approved. If approved by both
agencies, the final EIS will probably be published next
February or March.
     Anticipation of a discovery of hydrocarbons by the
well is low. So far, only 14 of 202 exploratory wells in
South Florida have produced oil or gas, and the only
well drilled in Broward County was a duster.
     For a copy of the draft EIS, contact Robert Abbey,
District Manager, Bureau of Land Management, 411

Edwards signs oilfield bill

     Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards has signed into
law the Oilfield Restoration Act to clean up E&P sites
statewide.
     Heavily supported by oil and gas interests, the law
levies a fee of 1"/barrel on oil and a 0.2"/mcf of
natural gas produced in the state, with a $10/yr charge
for non-producing wells.
     Levied at the wellhead, the fees will be collected in
the same way as the state's severance tax, using
monthly producer payments. The money will go into
the Oilfield Site Restoration Trust Fund, and will
finance the reclamation of about 2,000 known
orphaned and abandoned sites in Louisiana.
Temporarily abandoned or saltwater disposal wells in
stripper fields are exempt.
     There is a $10 million ceiling and a $6 million floor
on the fund; it's expected to generate $4-5 million in its
first year. The fund will be administered by a
commission made up of the Natural Resources Dept.
secretary and six others who will be selected by Gov.
Edwards from industry and environmental
organizations.

Environmental patents

     M.M. Francis and T.R. Jack have patented a
process for biodegradation of oily waste in a passively
aerated bioreactor that contains a porous, substantially
oleophilic matrix, such as peat. The process may be
used to treat the types of oily wastes conventionally
disposed of in landfarming operations. The technique
provides the potential to reduce the loss of leachates
and to control the loss of volatiles (Canadian Patent
No. 2,032,610).
     F.D. Rowsell has patented a method for collecting
and recovering oil spills in water. The spills are treated
with amine-substituted water-swelling clays added to
the spill in amounts that herd oil into islands separated
by surfaces of water containing no oil. The clays can
also be added to oil spills in an amount that produces
quasi-solid, buoyant organoclay-oil flocculate clumps
that float in the water and can be collected from the
surface (U.S. Patent No. 5,176,831).
     J.B. Rodden of Shell Oil Co. has patented a system
for removal and disposal of minor amounts of
organics from contaminated water. The process uses a
pump to feed water from the body of contaminated
water to the system, where indirect heat exchange and
direct steam addition raises its temperature. A stripping
vessel uses gas to strip the heated water and remove
the volatile contaminants (U.S. Patent No. 5,176,798).

EPA to update regs

     EPA is proposing to update a portion of the outer
continental shelf air regulations for the OCS lying
offshore Southern California.
     Appearing in the June 18 issue of the Federal
Register (58 FR 33589), the notice says the portions of
the OCS air regs that are being updated relate to the
requirements for OCS sources for which the Santa
Barbara Air Pollution Control District, Ventura County
APCD and San Luis Obispo APCD are the
corresponding onshore areas. Deadline for comments
is July 19.
     The 1990 Clean Air Amendments require EPA to
periodically update the requirements applying to OCS
sources located within 25 miles of states' seaward
boundaries to keep them consistent with the
requirements of the corresponding onshore areas
(E&PE 9/4/92).
     Comments on the update should be mailed (in
duplicate if possible) to EPA Air Docket (A-5), Attn:
Docket No. A-93-16, Environmental Protection
Agency, Air and Toxics Division, Region 9, 75

     The Minerals Management Service has published
the following reports dealing with environmental
studies in the Gulf of Mexico.
     Adaptation of the Minerals Management Service's
Oil-Weathering Model for Use in the Gulf of Mexico

Alberta mulls new well fee

     Alberta regulators are considering imposing a one-
time fee on first-time drillers in the province and
applying the proceeds to restoration of orphan
wellsites.
     The Energy Resources Conservation Board says
the C$10,000 fee would go into a fund to be used to
return orphan wells in Alberta to an environmentally
acceptable state. Operators with a history of drilling in
Alberta will not pay the fee, but any newly formed
company or any operating in the province for the first
time will be subject to the charge.
     Operators now pay a C$500 well licensing fee
along with an orphan well surcharge of C$40 for every
well suspended in 1992. For 1993, this surcharge was
increased to C$60/well.
     The ERCB has identified some 17 orphan wells to
date. Costs for each well vary, depending on the
amount of work needed to properly abandon and clean
up a site.
     The C$10,000 fee is still in the proposal stage, and
is not expected to become standard procedure prior to
this summer. However, while Alberta has some 700
oil and gas companies registered in the province, an
estimated 3,000 companies own all or part of various
Alberta wells.
     This leads to difficulty in tracking down some
owners, and officials believe this is exactly the kind of
problem the new orphan well fee could help alleviate.

EPA issues PM-10 rule

     EPA has issued the final rule revising the
maximum allowable increase for particulate matter
under the requirements for prevention of significant
deterioration (PSD) of air quality.
     Published in the June 3 issue of the Federal
Register (58 FR 31622), the revisions affect the
regulations in 40 CFR parts 51 and 52 which specify
the increments for particulate matter with a diameter of
10 micrometers (PM-10) or less.
     The effective date for the rule varies. For the federal
PSD program, the implementation date is June 3,
1994. For EPA-approved state PSD programs, the
rule goes into effect on the date when the state's revised
program, containing the new increments, is approved
by EPA.
     For additional information, contact Dan Deroeck,
Air Quality Management Division (MD-15), Office of
Air Quality Planning and Standards, EPA, Research
Triangle Park, N.C. 27711, telephone 919-541-5593.

Wildlife centers planned

     A permanent network of wildlife rescue and
rehabilitation centers, partly financed by interest earned
from the state's Oil Spill Prevention and Response
Trust Fund, may open in California.
     Provision for the permanent R&R network for
animals is contained in the amended version of a bill
sponsored by state Sen. Diane Watson. The centers
would serve the Los Angeles-Long Beach and San
Francisco areas, as well as San Diego, Port Hueneme,
Monterey Bay, and Humboldt Bay.
     Additional money would come in the form of
$500,000 in federal funds.

Expanded UIC regs opposed

     An expansion of the underground injection control
regulations proposed by EPA has drawn criticism by
independent operators.
     The Federal Advisory Committee is considering the
draft rule being prepared to cover construction
requirements for Class 2 wells under the Safe
Drinking Water Act.
     The rule seeks to expand the area of review
requirements to all wells, increase specific well
construction requirements, and would mandate
increased mechanical integrity testing.
     The expanded requirements were proposed as
safeguards to protect drinking water contamination
from injected oil and gas wastes. Trade groups like the
Independent Petroleum Assn. of America and
Pennsylvania's Independent Oil & Gas Assn. contend
the changes are unwarranted and would be particularly
burdensome to smaller producers.
     They say studies by the Government Accounting
Office and American Petroleum Institute found only
four cases of aquifer contamination from the nation's
170,000 active injection wells and 2.2 million
abandoned or inactive wells.
     The economic estimate provided in the draft rule
forecasts that up to 65% of the total $124 million
compliance costs for the first five years would fall
disproportionately on "small entities" such as stripper
operations concentrated in geographical areas like
Appalachia.
     The independents also point to a 1987 EPA report
to Congress that concluded strippers constitute a
special subcategory of the oil and gas industry that
should be considered independently and which
warrants special regulatory actions tailored to their
operation.
     Barry Russell, IPAA vice president and general
counsel, told E&PE industry has urged EPA to "go
back to the drawing board and recalculate the energy
and cost impacts of any UIC program changes."

Global Cooperation on Climate Change:  Experts Recommend Paths to
Effective Action

     This year will mark the beginning of formal negotiations
toward an international framework convention on climate change.
Protocols to add specific and binding targets will follow, or may
even accompany the convention.  What lessons can we learn from
previous agreements?  What obstacles will negotiators face?  Is a
global agreement likely to be effective, or could regional
agreements and unilateral actions be stronger in the short term?
To help answer these questions, GECR spoke with some of the
leading figures in the current drive to define the elements of a
convention on climate change.
     The 1985 Vienna Convention on Protection of the Ozone Layer,
and the subsequent Montreal Protocol, are widely seen as models
for future global environmental agreements.  The Vienna
Convention (which itself was partially modeled after the 1977
Barcelona Convention) was established as an interim agreement
when it became apparent that a specific protocol would not yet
have wide support; however it was a definite, formal statement of
commitment by governments to future action on the ozone depletion
problem.  The Montreal Protocol, signed two years later, added
legally binding deadlines for the reduction of ozone-depleting
chemicals.
     This two-step process (convention followed by protocol) was
necessary for the ozone treaty, but should the same procedure be
followed for a climate change agreement?  Why not aim for an
accord that includes protocols, particularly one on CO2?  "I
think that will delay it," says Ambassador Richard Benedick, the
chief US negotiator of the Montreal Protocol, now on detail from
the US State Department as senior fellow of the Conservation
Foundation/World Wildlife Fund in Washington, DC. "People aren't
ready for a protocol [on CO2], and I think you have to go through
a process to get there.  I believe in partial solutions -- in
fact, the Montreal Protocol is already a partial solution for
climate change -- and we ought to disaggregate rather than
complexify.  The framework convention could have some teeth, but
we shouldn't try to cram it up with too much.  It will load down
the convention, and we'll never finish it.  I'd rather go step by
step."
     A framework convention will be difficult enough to negotiate
(the current goal is to have a convention ready for signature at
the UN's Conference on Environment and Development in June 1992),
but producing the relevant protocols could prove an even greater
challenge.  As Benedick points out, we already have one
greenhouse gas treaty in the Montreal Protocol, but creating an
agreement that can reduce carbon dioxide worldwide while still
serving the short- and long-term interests of developed and
developing countries will test the limits of the parties'
diplomacy, cooperation, and patience.  Carbon dioxide carries far
more economic and political weight than CFCs ever could.
     Some observers are concerned that a truly effective
international agreement to limit carbon dioxide emissions won't
be signed by more than a handful of countries.  According to
Michael Grubb of the Royal Institute of International Affairs in
London, UK, a treaty with any given reduction target would prove
relatively easy for parties like the US and the USSR to comply
with:  neither currently uses energy efficiently, and they have
many options available to reduce emissions.  But Japan or France,
which are already quite energy-efficient in terms of CO2
emissions, might argue against such "equal reduction" targets
because it would be unfairly expensive for them to take emissions
down another percentage.  Thus, any agreement based on equal
reductions could result in a "lowest common denominator"
compromise, which may not be strong enough to address the problem
of global emissions.  Richard Benedick says this becomes less of
a problem if the treaty establishes a retroactive baseline year
for emission levels back to the mid-eighties, for example, so
countries can credit their existing energy-efficiency policies
toward the targeted levels.  Still, setting that baseline year
could be problematic:  Japan began major measures to reduce
emissions in the 1970s.  Do we want to go back that far?
     This example merely hints at the complexity of establishing
targets that a majority of countries will accept.  And once goals
are established, ways to achieve and enforce them must still be
settled.  A number of agencies, groups, and individuals are
currently analyzing carbon taxes (domestic and international),
leasable or tradeable emission permits, and other regulatory or
incentive options, to see which ones might be most effective and
politically feasible.
     The idea of a Law of the Atmosphere is gaining some support,
although as Peter Faross of the European Commission headquarters
in Brussels explained to GECR, "a lot of countries are very
sensitive when you try to touch on their sovereignty rights.  And
the broad and ambitious approach of a full-fledged law for the
atmosphere might be a very time-consuming process.  You may
arrive at the point where it's too late to implement the
necessary action because the discussions would last too long."
The unsigned Law of the Sea stands in testimony to the political
unpopularity of international control systems.
     Peter Thacher, former deputy executive director of the
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and assistant
secretary general of the UN, who now works with the World
Resources Institute in Washington, DC, says that the appropriate
way toward international cooperation on the global warming issue
is through a comprehensive action plan, much like the "Action
Plan to Protect Stratospheric Ozone" that UNEP developed for
governments in 1977.  An action plan for climate change would
contain a legal chapter, calling for negotiation and early
adoption of a framework convention and the first of several
protocols to deal with individual greenhouse gases, such as CO2.
The plan would also have a scientific chapter to implement --
with heavy involvement of the International Geosphere-Biosphere
Program -- the intensified research and monitoring that is needed
to help bring other greenhouse gases under international control.
This calls for an additional chapter to ensure that international
mechanisms and funding are adequate to mount a stronger global
research effort.  "These funds are needed today," Thacher says,
"and should not be delayed until treaties are ready."
     Thacher acknowledges that negotiating international
conventions and protocols could take time.  What about other
actions in the meantime?  "I think the `big boys' ought to tackle
this on their own, unilaterally taking steps in their own
self-interest," Thacher told GECR.  The industrialized nations
have their own organs, such as the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD), to do this if they want to
avoid using the UN.  "They can all benefit by looking at policy
implications of improving energy efficiency.  I think that ought
to get started without waiting for a package deal in which the
developed countries are involved.  They ought to get started
because that's where the big CO2 cutbacks can be achieved in the
shortest time."
     Michael Grubb takes a similar view: "You have to ask
seriously whether you really need to get all countries involved
at this stage, and you may well conclude that you can do more
with less:  70% of global carbon emissions are produced by the
US, Europe (East and West), and the USSR, so you may get
something useful from a more limited number of countries."  Grubb
stresses that global participation is ultimately necessary, but
notes that unilateral, bilateral, and regional efforts could be
important stepping stones on the way toward that goal.
     Conversations with sources at the OECD and the European
Commission indicate that neither body expects to develop
agreements among its members apart from the UN's global treaties,
but both are working on climate change issues on their own and
through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
The OECD will hold a meeting in late January among its member
countries to discuss the questions they will need to consider
when they develop climate change policies.  The discussions
should help OECD countries work out some of their differences in
order to facilitate the formal IPCC negotiations.  The
International Energy Agency (IEA) and the OECD are collaborating
on an energy and greenhouse gas "outlook" up to the year 2005,
which will provide the basis for evaluation in 1990 of the
potential for and costs of specific sectoral actions to reduce
emissions.  And the European Commission is creating a coherent
energy saving program called SAFE, which it expects to release
this year.
     The IPCC will present the elements of a framework convention
at the Second World Climate Conference (29 October - 7 November
1990); formal negotiations will begin then or shortly thereafter.
Cooperation will be hard-won, but essential.  In his 1968 essay,
"The Tragedy of the Commons," Garrett Hardin wrote that "we are
locked into a system of `fouling our own nest,' so long as we
behave only as independent, rational, free-enterprisers." If we
knowingly choose not to abandon free enterprise and rationality,
then to avoid the tragedy of the global commons we must
compromise some of our independence.  Global solutions will take
time and will be imperfect, but in the end, it seems they'll be
the ones that matter.

United Nations Confirms 1992 World Conference on Environment

     In late December, the 44th session of the United Nations
General Assembly formally approved a proposal to go forward with
the long-planned World Conference on Environment and Development
to be held in Brazil in 1992.  The conference, which will be the
second UN-sponsored world meeting on the environment (the first
was held in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1972), is expected to last two
weeks, and will be timed to coincide with World Environment Day
(5 June, 1992).  An open-ended preparatory committee, based in
the UN General Assembly, will meet five times to plan the
conference, with the first meeting planned for March 1990 in New
York.  The committee will hold its subsequent meetings in Geneva
and Nairobi, with a final meeting in New York to solidify plans.
     During the UN session, developed and developing countries
had to negotiate the locations of the planning meetings, as well
as which body of the UN would be responsible for planning the
conference.  Industrialized countries originally favored the
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) as the appropriate
planning group, with meetings to occur in Geneva.  Developing
countries objected to this choice on the grounds that they are
not well represented in Geneva, and they felt that their needs
would be better served by a planning committee drawn from the
General Assembly.

CFC Taxes Now in Effect in US

     As of 1 January 1990, US producers and importers of
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) must pay a base tax of $1.37 per pound
of chemical, with adjustments according to the particular
chemical's ozone depleting potential.  Importers of products
manufactured with the use of CFCs (such as automobiles,
electronic equipment, refrigerators, etc.) are subject to the
tax, which will be passed on to consumers.  The tax was
originally sponsored by Representative Peter Stark (Democrat,
California), and was incorporated in the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1989.  The Internal Revenue Service
released initial guidelines on 22 December; final regulations
have not yet been issued.
     The base tax will rise incrementally, with an increase to
$1.67 per pound in 1992, jumping to $2.65 per pound the following
year.  From 1995 on, the rate will increase by $.45 annually.
Halons, recycled CFCs, CFCs used for manufacturing rigid foam
insulation, and CFCs used as feedstocks (i.e., entirely consumed
in the process of producing another chemical) are not currently
covered by the law.  Manufacturers of CFCs and halons for export
are exempt unless they surpass their current level of exports, in
which case they must either pay the tax or apply to the
Environmental Protection Agency for new allowances.  Halon and
rigid foam manufacturers will pay the full tax beginning in 1994,
but are required to pay a reduced base rate ($.25/pound) from
1991 until then.  US companies can still produce ozone-depleting
chemicals outside the US without paying the tax, so long as the
chemicals are not imported into the US.
     Floor stocks are covered by the tax in cases where inventory
is being held for sale or for use in further manufacture.
Companies (defined by employer identification number) that hold
total floor stocks of less than 400 pounds are exempt from this
tax.  The GECR Document Service will provide all relevant
documents (legislation, IRS guidance, a list of products subject
to the tax, etc.).  Call the GECR Hotline for more information,
at TEL: +1-617-648-8700.

China Releases Results of Afforestation Programs

     China has planted enough trees in its northern provinces
over the past 12 years to increase forest cover by over 25
million hectares (250,000 square kilometers), according to a
Chinese official news agency report released 5 December 1989.
The country began the afforestation program in 1977 to "harmonize
the development of agriculture, forests, and animal by-products,
and to control sand expansion."  Grain production in areas now
protected by trees has risen 10% - 30%, and grassland in the
region has increased by 20%.
     According to the report, 16.5 million hectares (165,000
square kilometers) of forest were planted by airplane, with the
rest planted manually.  The report states that total forest
coverage in the 13 northern provinces has increased to slightly
more than 7%, up from 5% in 1977.  China plans to spend "several
decades" constructing additional forest protection systems in the
region.
     Because the figures for the total afforested area seem high,
GECR checked Chinese-English translation of the figures with
several sources, but we were not able to get independent
confirmation of the areas from China.  According to World
Resources 1988-89, published by the World Resources Institute in
Washington, DC, "China has the world's largest reforestation
program, planting new forests at the rate of more than 4.5
million hectares per year."

Mexico City Improves Air Quality by Restricting Driving

     The government of Mexico City, in response to public concern
about winter air pollution levels, has implemented a program to
restrict driving in the Mexican capital from 20 November 1989
through 28 February 1990.  According to Ramon Ojeda, the city's
director of prevention and control of contamination, "each car in
the metropolitan area has to be idle one day a week from Monday
through Friday."
     Stickers, coded with a color specific to the day that a car
is not allowed on the road, have been affixed to license plates
on all city-registered vehicles (automobiles and
non-passenger-carrying trucks).  Cars from outside the city are
restricted based on the last digit of their plate number.
Weekends are unrestricted, as is the period from 10 pm to 5 am
every night.  Taxis and buses are not included in the program.
     According to Ojeda, Mexico City has 2,300,000 vehicles
registered, and the program has decreased the number of vehicles
on the road by over 400,000 per day.  Vehicles caught driving on
their restricted day are impounded and held for 24 hours.  Owners
must pay a fine equivalent to one month's minimum wage salary
(currently 380,000 pesos, or US $125.00) to recover their cars.
Since the program began, the city has issued 7,000 fines, which
Ojeda sees as a relatively low figure, and a sign that most
people are obeying the rules.  "The public has supported the
program enthusiastically, and there weren't any complaints,"
Ojeda told GECR.  "To the contrary, they want it to continue all
year."  The city's public transportation system seems to be
little affected by the program, since most people are electing to
car-pool.  Ojeda is enthusiastic about the program, saying that
"now the skies are clearer:  you can see the volcanoes."

Cairo Conference Sets New Tone of Cooperation Among Countries

     The World Conference on Preparing for Climate Change, held
in Cairo, Egypt from 17 - 21 December, 1989, set a new tone for
global cooperation, according to John Topping, president of the
Climate Institute in Washington, DC.  The conference was convened
by the Climate Institute, the United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP), and the government of Egypt, and was
co-sponsored by 20 international agencies and organizations.
     Conference participants released the "Cairo Compact," a
proclamation toward a concerted world-wide response to the
climate crisis, which recognizes among other things the
responsibility of all countries, including developing nations, to
take measures in their own self-interest to reduce emissions.
     This was the first major world conference on climate change
to be held in a developing country, and Topping told GECR that a
distinguishing feature of this conference was the strong sense of
cooperation and common purpose -- and a relative lack of the
"North-South" tensions that have tended to plague such meetings
in the past.  "The Egyptians set the tone, which allowed it to be
successful in creating a sense of global commitment," Topping
told GECR.  The proclamation was initially endorsed by developing
countries as well as the industrialized nations.
     The conference focused strongly on adaptive measures, "not
because emission control isn't critically important -- it is, and
we're obviously very concerned about it -- but the problem is
that a lot of the developing countries will be affected even under a
stringent emissions control scenario."  Topping says that the
conference helped underscore industrialized nations' concern for
the safety and welfare of people in developing countries, not
just concern about their emissions.

Scientists Lower Estimates of Potential Sea Level Rise

     Predictions of sea level rise of up to 1.5 meters by the
year 2100 are probably overestimates, according to studies
presented at a recent meeting of the American Geophysical Union
(AGU).  Over 4,000 scientists met in San Francisco, California,
USA, on 4 - 8 December 1989 to discuss a wide variety of topics,
including global warming and sea level rise.
     Thirty years of observations of the Antarctic ice sheet have
led Charles R. Bentley, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison,
Wisconsin, USA, to conclude that the polar ice cap may actually
be removing water from the sea, accounting for a sea level drop
of 5 mm per year.  Bentley believes that the short-term response
to global warming is increased snowfall over Antarctica as
warming air takes up and holds more water.  This snow
accumulation would outpace any melting of the ice sheet,
according to Bentley.  Bentley stresses the importance of viewing
the Antarctic ice sheet as a dynamic system that responds to
climate changes over long periods of time.
     Satellite observations by H. Jay Zwally of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight
Center, in Greenbelt, Maryland, USA, show that the Greenland ice
sheet is thickening as a result of increased precipitation, and
Zwally suggests that the thickening will continue.  Research
conducted by Tad Pfeffer, Mark Meier, and Tissa Illangasekare, of
the University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, USA, indicates
that meltwater runoff from arctic glaciers may take a significant
amount of time to reach the ocean as it refreezes while filling
in snowpack pores as deep as 50 meters.
     According to Meier, by the year 2050 -- the time atmospheric
CO2 is projected to double -- melting of small glaciers may have
contributed about 0.15 meters to sea level rise, thermal
expansion may contribute a 0.2 meter rise, and human factors
(such as pumping groundwater into the oceans) may contribute
another 0.2 meter rise.  Greenland would contribute a 0.08 meter
fall in sea level, and Antarctica would lower levels by an
additional 0.31 meter.  Meier cautioned that the picture is still
quite uncertain, but that "it's beginning to look now as if sea
rise will lag behind warming by a significant amount."

Researcher Documents Acid Precipitation's Effect on Spruce
Seedlings

     Acidic clouds that envelope high-elevation forests for up to
35% of the year in the eastern US can cause more severe damage to
trees than acid rain does, according to Jay Jacobson of the Boyce
Thompson Institute of Plant Research at Cornell University,
Ithaca, New York, USA.  The acid clouds have a pH of 3.5, several
times more acidic than acid rain, which has an average pH of 4.
The rising and lowering of the clouds over mountaintops causes
the acid measured on tree leaves to become concentrated to pH
levels as low as 2 as the water evaporates, Jacobson told GECR.
Jacobson studied the effects of acidified water vapor on red
spruce (Pinea rubens) seedlings, a species that dominates many
eastern US mountaintop forests.
     In greenhouse and field studies, Jacobson determined that
the effects of acidic mist depended on the relative
concentrations of sulfuric and nitric acid.  Acid precipitation
generally has a higher concentration of sulfuric acid than nitric
acid, along with small amounts of ammonium ions.  Sulfuric acid
alone was more damaging to needles by causing localized death of
plant tissue and premature loss of needles from the seedlings.
Nitric acid mist appeared to influence nutrient relationships by
increasing nitrogen levels and decreasing levels of calcium and
magnesium in the leaves.  However, sulfuric acid mist affected
the spruce needles at lower concentrations than did nitric acid,
Jacobson told GECR.
     Jacobson's research is part of the five-year federally
funded National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program, which
involved more than 700 scientists and a half billion dollars in
research money.  Funding expires this year; Jacobson told GECR
that some of the work is unfinished and inconclusive, but he says
it is unlikely that federal funding for the program will be
renewed.

Antarctic Ozone Hole Broke Up Earlier Than Expected in 1989

     The 1989 Antarctic ozone hole got off to an earlier and
stronger start than the 1987 hole, but it started to break up a
month earlier than expected, according to Mark Schoeberl of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard
Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, USA.  "The polar
vortex in 1989 began to break up in mid-to-late October; in 1987,
it held intact all the way through November," Schoeberl told
GECR.  The total amount of ozone "ended up going down to almost
exactly the same level as or perhaps slightly higher (by about 10
Dobson Units) than 1987."
     The breakup of the ozone hole is controlled by two major
factors, Schoeberl explained: one is the intrinsic resistance to
breakup of the ozone hole caused by the ozone reduction itself,
and the other is the nature of the forces that tend to break up
the polar vortices.  These forces are extremely variable from
year to year and are unpredictable.  A more active dynamical
stratosphere that would tend to break up the hole or prevent its
formation "generally goes with the QBO (the Quasi-Biennial
Oscillation, a switching of tropical winds from east to west that
occurs approximately every 27 months)," Schoeberl told GECR, "but
this year was an exception."  Normally, with an easterly QBO, the
ozone hole is not as deep, as was the case in 1988.  Tropical
winds were still easterly in 1989, but "the link was broken
between the QBO and the zonality of the flow."  The vortex flow
tended to follow east-west latitude lines in 1989, keeping the
polar stratosphere quiet enough to cause ozone depletion nearly
as great as in 1987's record-setting hole.  "Then we had a big
dynamical event in October and the hole started to break up."
When the polar vortex is disrupted, undepleted air comes into the
system and ozone levels begin to rise.

Tree-Ring Research Used in Study of Climate Change

     Scientists in the US, USSR, China, Argentina, New Zealand,
Canada, India, Australia, and Europe are studying the rings of
long-lived trees for clues to historic and prehistoric climate
change.  Certain species of trees can accurately indicate periods
of drought and temperature fluctuations, and may be used to
reconstruct past climate events and trends.
     Malcolm Hughes, Director of the University of Arizona's
Laboratory of Tree Ring Research in Tucson, Arizona, USA, is
studying the rings of giant sequoias as a potential climate
record.  The trees can grow to at least 2,600 years old, and they
show "a good drought signal," with extremely narrow rings in dry
years.  Sequoias can thus show the frequency of severe droughts
in the region surrounding the trees.
     Researchers have to select carefully the tree species and
the individuals sampled to ensure that the growth ring response
can be correlated to the parameter being studied.  "A bristlecone
pine at a high elevation has a different response than one at
lower elevations," David Meko of the Laboratory of Tree Ring
Research points out.  Long-lived trees are often few and far
between, and getting good spacial coverage of a particular
species can be a problem.  The tree ring record must be
calibrated with known instrumental records in order to be used
with confidence, which can prove difficult if records are scarce
for the parameter (soil temperature, rainfall, etc.) being
measured.
     Gordon Jacoby, of the Tree Ring Laboratory at Lamont-Doherty
Laboratory in New York, USA, says that his group has recently
reconstructed  northern hemisphere temperatures for a 300-year
period using tree rings, and the reconstruction shows a warming
trend within the last hundred years "that is unusual in the
context of the 300 year record."  Jacoby was able to sample many
individuals of the same species (white spruce) over almost 90
degrees of longitude.  "We covered about 25% of the circumpolar
area in a fairly homogeneous data set."  White spruce is limited
by thermal properties such as air temperature, ground
temperature, and soil temperature, and is moisture-stressed when
the active zone above the permafrost is extremely cold, reducing
the tree's ability to take up water.

Energy-Efficient Lights are Selling, But Producers Face
Challenges

     The market for compact fluorescent lamps, which have typical
life spans of 8,000 to 10,000 hours and can save users 75% or
more of the costs associated with standard incandescent bulbs, is
"growing at about 25% per annum," according to Vivienne Charrett
of Thorn Lighting in Enfield, UK.  Much of that growth can be
attributed to incentive programs by electric utilities, such as
rebate offers, options to lease rather than purchase expensive
light bulbs, and giveaways.  Carol O'Neill of Philips Lighting
Company's US division in Somerset, New Jersey, told GECR that
growth in sales can also be attributed to media attention,
efforts by environmental groups, and general concern about global
warming.  Still, O'Neill says that compact fluorescents, while
"experiencing explosive growth," represent a minute percentage of
overall lighting sales.
     Producers face a number of obstacles in their effort to
bring compact fluoresents to a wider market.  Amory Lovins,
director of research at the Rocky Mountain Institute in Old
Snowmass, Colorado, USA, says that "we need to decouple
utilities' profits from their sales so they will no longer be
rewarded for selling more electricity, nor penalized for selling
less.  And when they do something smart to cut your bill, they
need to be allowed to keep part of the savings as extra profit."

     Other concerns, according to Lovins, include a lack of
properly trained installation technicians, the fact that no one
currently provides retrofit components in bundled packaging,
limited competition in certain areas (central Europe, Australia,
New Zealand) that allows manufacturers to sell at excessive
markups, and the need for more imaginative marketing.  "I haven't
yet seen any compact fluorescent manufacturer go for the green
market by pointing out that each lamp takes a ton of CO2 out of
the air over its life [when compared with other lamps]," Lovins
told GECR.
     Energy-efficient lamps appear to be selling better overall
in Europe and the UK than the US.  Vivienne Charrett of Thorn
claims this is due to the cost of energy: "The country with the
least penetration of compact fluorescents is France, where the
cost of energy is exceptionally low."  Fred Steinmeyer of Osram
in Munich, West Germany agrees, saying that Europe recognized the
need to save energy earlier than the US.  Dick Dowhan of GTE
confirms that the difference could be attributed to Europe's
early start on the market, but he also cited Europe's 220-volt
system as a reason:  customers don't notice as much of a
difference between incandescents and compact fluorescents as
Americans do.  Amory Lovins says, "I don't think it has much to
do with electricity price.  I think it's a function of utility
participation, and least-cost-planning or an equivalent process."

UK Residential Investment in Energy-Saving Equipment Drops 12% in
1989

     The British government's scrapping of numerous
energy-efficiency programs in the past two years has directly
affected domestic purchases of energy-saving  equipment,
according to Andrew Warren of the London-based Association for
the Conservation of Energy (ACE).  Using sales figures from
relevant trade associations, ACE found that residential
investment in energy-saving products dropped significantly in
1989, down 12% from already declining 1988 levels.
     Purchases of weatherstripping (draft proofing) were down
15%; double-glazed windows dropped nearly 20%; and economical
heating equipment (energy-efficient boilers, thermostatic
radiator valves, etc.) declined by 6%, with Warren forecasting a
12% drop.
     Warren points out that the cutting of incentives and
education programs for energy efficiency directly conflicts with
UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's stated commitment to fight
global warming.  "The policies are going in the wrong direction,"
Warren told GECR, "and Thatcher's own government's submission to
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says that if
present trends in the UK continue, we will see CO2 emissions
leaping.  We're currently at 579.3 billion tons a year; we're
likely to see rises of 29% - 34% across the next 15 years, and up
to 48% - 58% in 30 years."

General Motors Displays Advanced Electric Car

     General Motors Corporation, the world's largest automobile
manufacturer, has unveiled a sophisticated electric car that can
accelerate from 0 - 60 miles per hour (0 - 96 km/h) in eight
seconds, and can run for 120 miles (192 km) at highway speeds
without charging the batteries.  Recharging can be accomplished
in several hours by plugging into a conventional wall socket.
The prototype vehicle, called the "Impact," could be on the
market by the mid-1990s, but several problems must first be
overcome:  operating costs of the vehicle are currently about
twice those for gasoline-powered cars because the entire battery
pack must be replaced (at a cost of US $1,500) every 20,000 miles
(32,000 km).  The company has also not yet tested the vehicle's
crash-worthiness.
     Spokesmen for General Motors claim that given adequate
demand, the purchase price of the sporty-looking car would be
similar to gasoline-powered vehicles in its class.  The company
hopes to improve the life of the battery pack to bring operating
costs down to those of conventional cars.  If the vehicle is
exported from the US to countries where fuel prices are taxed, or
if US fuel prices rose, the "Impact" could prove to be less
expensive to operate than gasoline-powered models.
     Electric cars are a mixed answer to threats of global
warming:  while they do not burn fossil fuels themselves, the
vehicles generally use utility-generated electric power to
recharge.  Still, a recent report prepared by the University of
California at Berkeley, California, USA, suggests that an
all-electric vehicle fleet could reduce CO2 emissions by up to
43%, depending on the mix of energy sources used by utilities and
the efficiency of the vehicles themselves.  Other alternatives
exist:  Solar powered cars are already in use in Europe, and a
number of companies and independent groups are developing
versions for the US market.  GECR will report on these and other
alternative-fueled vehicles (such as hydrogen-powered cars) in
future issues.

US EPA Proposes New Controls on Municipal Waste Incinerators

     On 30 November, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
proposed new controls on municipal waste incinerators that would
trap five times more dusty particulates than currently required,
along with 90 to 95% of sulfur dioxide and hydrochloric acid, and
97% to 99% of airborne metals, such as lead and mercury.  The new
proposal also requires "tail gas" cleaning of nitrogen oxides,
which contribute to smog and acid rain, on those incinerators
which process more than 250 tons of trash daily.  This is
expected to reduce the nitrogen oxide emissions by 40%.  These
new standards are expected to reduce 90% of the air pollutants by
1994, a reduction of more than a quarter million tons annually,
according to Robin Woods at EPA.
     The proposal requires monitoring and verification of
emissions by trained and certified supervisors.  By 1993, plants
would also be required to recycle 25% of the trash they process.
If approved, the new rules would be applied directly to the 150
incinerators that will be constructed at 60 US facilities in the
next five years, with the 450 incinerators currently in operation
at 200 plants being given several years to make the necessary
improvements.  Dave Ryan at the EPA told GECR that it may be a
full year before this proposal is approved and instituted.
     Woods estimates the national costs associated with the
proposed standards for new facilities to be $190 million
annually, which represents an increase of $13 per ton of
incinerated trash from the current $60 per ton.  It would cost
$320 million a year nationally to improve existing facilities, an
increase of $12 per ton.  In both cases, this translates to an
increase of $20 per year per household.  Public hearings will be
held in Boston on 22-23 January, Detroit on 25-26 January, and
Seattle on 30-31 January.  For more information on the public
hearings, call Ann Eleanor of the EPA at TEL: +1-919-541-5578.

Wind Power Plant Construction Expands in Midwest

In Minnesota, Northern Alternative Energy, Inc. of Minneapolis and
Micon Wind Turbines (U.S.) of Marshall are gearing up to expand the
Sibley, IA wind plant owned by IES Utilities, Inc.  When completed, 
the project will be the single largest turbine installation in the 
nation's midsection.

The first U.S.-made 600-kW Micon M1500-600/150 turbine will be
installed by Micon and NAE in Sibley, expanding the facility's
capacity to 925 kW from 325 kW.

The annual energy output of the plant is anticipated to top 1.8
million kWh after installation of the new turbine.  NAE president
Greg Jaunich said that this largest single turbine in the Midwest 
"should demonstrate to utilities in the region the benefits of 
large, industrial-sized wind turbines for electrical generation."

The nacelle and frame of the turbine were constructed by Micon and
Hutchinson Manufacturing Inc., which also assembled the generator
and its components.  Micon turbines are a Danish design.  The 
turbine, atop its 150-foot tubular tower, will be made by Thomas & 
Betts of Red Wing, MI.

European Commission Beefs Up Research Budget

Mme. Edith Cresson, European Commissioner for Research, Education 
and Training recently proposed 318 research and development projects
that have been approved by the EC as the European Community's 
participatory offering following the Fourth Framework Convention 
meeting on climate change.

Addressed will be ozone depletion, global warming, floods,
earthquakes, contaminated land and sustainable development.  The
Environment and Climate program will fund the research.

The Environment and Climate program has a budget of ECU 532 million,
which represents 4.3 percent of total Fourth Framework Program
funding covering 1994-1998.  Research to understand basic mechanisms 
of climate and other natural systems and how they impact natural 
resources will be performed.

Technologies will also be developed to monitor, protect and
rehabilitate as well as to conduct risk assessment.  Satellite
systems for earth observation and environmental research play a 
large part in the research.

Past climatic changes and dynamics will receive increased attention
to help understand current weather patterns.  The EPICA projects
will complement three successful Greenland ice cap projects by 
studying ice cores in Antarctica that will allow scientists to 
interpret earlier climate shifts over a half-million years.

Aerosols originating from dust, sea-spray, soot and suspended sulfur
dioxide are known to be important in the earth's energy balance.
Surrounded by cloud particles, they absorb radiation and also 
reflect it back into space.  Program ACE-2 will address the role of 
clouds and aerosols in the climate system and will also continue to 
look at processes of both natural and manmade aerosols.

Finns Push Coal at Expense of Nuclear Power

A radical overhaul of fuel taxation being undertaken by the Finnish
government could see a rise in construction of coal-fired power
plants at the expense of existing nuclear power.  Finland has agreed 
that it will not expand nuclear power generation nor build more 
nuclear-based power stations, a strategy that appears to argue for 
expanded coal-fired energy production.

The Finnish move will bring Finnish taxation more into line with
neighbors Sweden, Norway and Denmark which tax consumption, not
production, as has been the case in Finland.  The tax burden on 
coal- fired production will be reduced by an amount to be determined 
when the legislature meets this month.

Premier Paavo Lipponen told the legislature in December that the new
energy policy took into consideration the unpopularity of
nuclear-based production as well as the need for ways to improve 
coal- fired generation's cost-efficiency.

Lipponen had run for election based on promises of higher taxes on
coal and peat-fired plants, but the about-face, explains Antti
Kalliomaki, Finland's Trade and Industry minister, is because 
Swedish companies would like to export power into Finland because 
Finnish energy production costs have remained so much higher.

PORTUGAL HOPES EU LOAN FUNDING WILL SPARK MINI-HYDRO REVIVAL

Companies hope that a new European Union-backed government fund will
breathe new life into the mini-hydro power sector in Portugal, where
investment has been brought to a virtual standstill by falling
electricity prices, a shortage of funds and, mainly, lack of support
from municipal authorities.

Projects have received a welcome impetus in the shape of a Es1.1bn
($7.3m) loan from Programa Energia, a fund set up in mid-1995 to
promote the diversification, expansion and improvement of energy
production and use.

This first allocation of money from the fund goes to three companies
that are investing in four small hydro-electric generating plants with
a total capacity of just under 30 MW.

They are Hidrocorgo, Hidroerg and HDN-Energia do Norte. Another 36
similar projects are being evaluated by the Energia programme, which is
expected to mobilise a total investment of Es180bn, mainly focused on
stimulating natural gas use, as well as rational energy utilisation and
diversification into renewable energy resources.

Hidrocorgo is part of the Enersis group, the biggest mini-hydro
constructor and operator in Portugal, in which Midland Electricity
Board of the UK has a holding of about 35%. Enersis has so far
installed 50 MW in 15 mini-hydro plants.

Antonio Sa da Costa, head of Portugal's Water Resources Association,
told FTWB that since legislation permitting small-scale private energy
production was introduced in May 1988, mini-hydro generating plants
with a total capacity of 140 MW and involving investments totalling
Es30bn have been built in Portugal. Mini-hydro plants are defined as
having a maximum capacity of 10 MW.

The liberalisation led to a rush of project proposals and applications
for almost 1,000 licenses to build mini-hydros had been made by 1991.
However, by 1993 only 120 licenses had been granted. Sa da Costa says
many applications were for identical sites, others proved technically
or economically non-viable, and many prospective investors found that
their projects would be far more costly than they had anticipated.

Companies have also been discouraged from entering the sector by a 40%
drop in the price of electricity to industrial consumers from 1988 to
1993. Until recently, small producers sold energy to Electricidade de
Portugal, the state power utility, at rates based on industrial
tariffs. Partly because of this, new construction of mini-hydro plants
almost came to a halt after 1993, when funding from the European
Union's Valoren programme ended.

However, Sa da Costa says the biggest obstacle to investment in mini-
hydros is now a lack of support from municipal authorities and
opposition from local populations. "Mini-hydros are one of the most
environmentally-friendly means of producing energy," he says. "But a
lack of information has led to opposition to small hydro plants in many
Portuguese localities, by residents who fear, wrongly, that the plants
will damage their rivers."

The transfers of the approval of the water resource and public works
components of mini-hydros from a central body to local authorities has
put a further brake on expansion. Only one licence has been granted
since the change was made in February 1994. "Lack of information and
lack of support from water resource bodies are our biggest enemy," says
Sa da Costa.

Companies will be lobbying Portugal's new Socialist government for a
more supportive approach to licensing. Sa da Costas believes that this,
together with soft loans from the Energia programme, will stimulate
renewed investment in small-scale hydro-production.

Portugal's legislation was changed in November, moving it towards the
German model in the form of a commitment to pay producers of energy
from renewable sources higher rates than companies who produce energy
from fossil fuels. EDP's regulations have also been changed. Mini-hydro
producers were previously paid different rates according to the output
voltage of the energy they supplied. A single rate has now been
established at the top end of the previous scale.

A further 150 MW of mini-hydro capacity could be built by 1999.
Portugal's total possible capacity is estimated at 300-400 MW. Current
capacity accounts for 420 GWh a year - enough to supply about 600,000
domestic consumers - out of Portugal's total consumption of about 24
TWh. This saves the county an estimated Es2bn a year in oil bills.

Funds under the Energia programme are loaned at zero interest and have
to be paid back over 12 years. No repayments have to be made for the
first three years. Plants, costing an average of Es2bn-2.5bn, take a
maximum of two years to build. This means companies can pay back the
loans from the earnings of their generating plants.

SHOULD SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR DROUGHT CUTS?

The latest (proposed) tweak of the regulatory screw must leave the UK
water companies wondering what else they are to made liable for. In a
consultation document published on 20 December the economic regulator,
OFWAT, asks for comment on a suggested scheme of compensation payments
to customers suffering supply cuts as a result of drought.

OFWAT is responding to a government request for advice on compensation
issues raised by the 1995 drought. The Environment Secretary  sought
the advice in the face of the changed public attitude to water supply,
now seen increasingly as a pure money making operation rather than a
public service; a hostile response to supplier pleas for conservation
during the drought indicated that, now water supply is a commercial
operation, the customer expects no cuts, whatever the reason. Before
1989 the heads of the public water authorities would have had little
hesitation in pointing out that such expectations were unrealistic.
Provision for supplying water and for carrying away storm sewage is
based on an assessment of risks made from analysis of past rainfall
statistics. On the supply side the infrastructure is sized to guarantee
supplies for particular minimum annual rainfall conditions judged
likely to occur only once in a certain number of years. Storm sewers
are similarly designed for particular likely `return periods', in this
case looking at the maximum storm intensity and duration likely to be
encountered. In both cases more rare events could be catered for, but
with a corresponding increase in infrastructure cost.

It is only a little over a year since OFWAT concluded a detailed look
at company business plans and set price limits for the next five years.
Those limits are based on certain service standards specified in a
`Guaranteed Standards Scheme' (GSS). Suppliers are obliged to pay
compensation if any of the standards are breached and all of the items
covered, such as response times to account queries or consumer
complaints, are clearly within company control. Equally clearly
rainfall is outside company control and supply cuts caused by lack of
rain are not included in the GSS. Nevertheless the basic engineering
underlying supply infrastructure has a proven record - there have been
no supply cuts under Emergency Drought Orders in England and Wales
since 1976.

Surely this was a realistic way to look at service provision and, if
companies are now to be required to cater for more severe drought
conditions than allowed for in current business plans the new targets,
agreed by the economic and resources regulators, must first be clearly
stated? If companies were then obliged to guarantee supplies in
conditions of, say 75% rather than 80% of average long-term rainfall
they might reasonably be made liable to pay compensation, but only if
the requisite infrastructure was not provided. This might be done by
more provision for inter-company or inter-regional transfers rather
than from increased abstractions/infrastructure in the supply area
concerned.

Any open-ended liability for compensation may well provide, as the
consultation paper suggests, "....a powerful financial
incentive.......to balance the costs of resources against the costs of
(supply) restrictions," but, on the one hand the suggested daily
compensation payment of around #10 (based on average bills) seems
little enough for the inconvenience that some consumers might suffer;
on the other hand many might think that a rare inconvenience arising
from the vagaries of nature should not be disguised as something a
water company could have prevented.

This attitude was certainly apparent last summer when the water
companies collectively rejected an OFWAT suggestion of compensation on
the grounds that the weather conditions were exceptional. One or two
companies, not in areas threatened by supply cuts, later offered
compensation where heavy demand caused loss of supply pressure but,
according to the consultation paper, no suppliers have agreed that use
of rota cuts or standpipes forced by drought will constitute a reason
for compensation. That stance  was well judged - although such measures
have not been needed for nearly 20 years the trend in climate-induced
pressure on supplies can be seen from the 22-year record on hosepipe
bans. Bans on household use of hosepipes are an early step on the path
to conservation when drought conditions threaten. As the illustration
shows bans have been imposed on 10% or more of the population in 5 of
the last 7 years but in only 3 of the previous 15 years.

In commenting on another climate-induced supply problem over the
Christmas/New Year period the Socialist opposition spokesman on the
environment suggested that a higher staffing level in some companies in
the north-east of England might have produced a quicker response to
supply failures. He was talking about pipe bursts caused by
exceptionally low temperatures followed by a rapid swing to warmer
weather. Although the company pipes concerned will have been laid at
depths regarded as standard for forty or fifty years there was an
immediate public outcry accompanied by newspaper and radio reports
suggesting possible fault on the part of the suppliers. Will low
temperatures be next on the government list for a compulsory
compensation scheme?

* The principle recommendations in the consultation paper are :

Compensation payments of #10 per customer per day, up to a maximum of
#100, for drought-imposed rota cuts or standpipe supply for a day or
part day.

Compensation of #25 in any year for frequent poor pressure supplies
caused by drought conditions

An entitlement for business customers to claim compensation for losses
arising from the imposition of Drought Orders. (Changes needed to
primary legislation)

No general compensation for customers affected by hosepipe bans but
affected metered customers  may receive #25 per year compensation.

COMPANIES WAIT FOR RAIN AS DROUGHT FEARS PERSISTS

For suppliers and the resources regulator, the National Rivers
Authority (NRA), drought fears have persisted into the new year after
heavy rainfall in September failed to continue into the later autumn
and early winter. Perversely even the heavy rain that did occur missed
much of the area worst affected by low rainfall last summer. By mid-
December many soils were reported far from saturated and groundwater
recharge and reservoir refilling was declared minimal.

The NRA supplied a second resource status report* to the environment
minister in December. The report outlines the measures individual
companies must take during the coming months to reduce the risk of
supply interruptions next summer. A central theme is maximum
abstractions from rivers to replenish reservoirs during the hoped-for
wetter winter months, avoiding the need for environmentally damaging
over-abstraction in the lower flow periods of summer. Severn Trent is
currently involved in a Public Inquiry, facing protests from fishing
interests over proposed increased river abstractions. Yorkshire Water,
where some areas remain under real threat of imposed rota cuts, is also
subject to environmental protests over proposed abstraction increases.

The NRA report lists company estimates of the possible 1996 outcomes
assuming average and 80% of average rainfall. Only four of the ten
major utilities express confidence for uninterrupted supplies next
summer. It might have been more logical to report on a uniform known
risk, for example the minimum rainfall conditions likely to recur in
each supply region once in ten years. This would mean rainfall of 70%
of long term average in some areas and 90% in others. As it is the risk
of 80% normal winter rainfall in Anglian region is 1 in 5 years and in
the North East 1 in 16 years.

The speed at which the drought overtook England and Wales and the
adverse public reaction to enforced supply restrictions has shaken the
industry. Only 10 months ago, in February 1995, even the NRA reported
that the resources outlook was good. At some time or other in the
following summer months 7million people, including business customers,
were banned from non-essential water use; 18 million were subjected to
hosepipe bans and many suffered interrupted supplies or low flows at
times of peak demand. Now, in mid-winter, hosepipe bans continue in
areas supplied by Severn Trent, North West and Yorkshire Water. Some
Yorkshire customers may yet see standpipes used and, over large areas
of the country, only exceptional rain in the coming 3 months will avert
major supply inconveniences next summer.

Suppliers had good reason to point to exceptional circumstances in
rejecting suggestions of compensation payments. The illustration shows
a continuous decline in rainfall from March to August. Accompanied by
unusual levels of sunshine - above normal in each month to November -
and with average temperatures at or above normal, this combined to set
evaporation rates at record levels.

There have been some positive outcomes. It has brought home to all
concerned, far better than any questionnaire, that the highest customer
priority is not clean bathing beaches or Class I rivers; it is a
continuous adequate water supply. The most immediate effect has been a
new look at leakage and a revised company programme to cut losses. In
the longer term it should send a message to government to maintain a
robust approach to any new proposals from Brussels. If things go badly
this summer some revision of the Urban Waste Water Directive programme
may be needed, a matter the government  raised in Brussels in the run-
up to the 1994 Prices Review.

SPAIN STAYS CAUTIOUS ON DROUGHT DESPITE RAINS

The wettest December for at least 30 years, following the first really
wet November after four years of the century's worst drought, has
brought relief to vast areas of central-southern Spain.

But experts were in general agreement that the drought was not over by
early January and there would have to be substantial rain this spring
before celebrations could start.

In essence, most areas have their short-term domestic consumption needs
resolved, but except for the western region  of Extremadura bordering
Portugal, irrigation restrictions will continue. This in spite of the
fact that many reservoirs in the southern water authorities of the
Guadiana, Guadalquivir and Tajo (Tagus) rivers saw dramatic increases
in reserves in little more than two weeks.

Some Andalucian dams in the south that were technically dry at
Christmas held up to 30% of capacity by 3 January. The average held in
the dams in the southern water authority regions was Guadiana (27.4%),
Guadalquivir (24.6%), Sur 24.4%) and Segura (12.5%). In nearly all
cases, the figure had been below 10% at Christmas.

The 14 dams run by Madrid's Canal de Isabel II water authority saw
reserves increase by 27% to over 47% of capacity between Christmas Eve
and January 3, but this was still below the 54.4% of exactly a year
before in full drought. Canal authorities remained cautious. Madrid's
last hydrological year which ended in September, was the driest since
1912.

The western half of Spain benefited most from the rain, to such an
extent that Portugal had to ask Spain to retain the flow of the Tagus
in the Valdecanas y Gabriel and Galan dams to avoid flooding the
Portuguese city of Santarem. But in some parts of the south-east -
Almeria, Murcia, southern Valencia - the improvement has been minimal.

The exploitation directors of the Guadalquivir, Guadiana, Sur and
Segura basins in the south, where more than eight million people suffer
daily restrictions, suggested that some restrictions could be eased by
mid-January. However, this was less likely in Segura in the far south-
east, where hydrographical confederation director Manuel Miron said on
January 2. "We have disgustingly splendid weather, with a completely
blue sky and temperatures above 25xC."

In the Guadiana region bordering Portugal, confederation chairman
Antonio Alcaraz was jubilant. "For the first time in four years I am
going to enjoy watching the partial emptying of a dam in Extremadura.
We've had two anxious years to get emergency works built around the
city of Badajoz, and now we have too much water." The Guadiana dams in
the Andalucia (or far southern) area held an amazing 79% of capacity on
January 3.

The Andalucian cities of Seville, Cordoba and Cadiz were likely to see
domestic restrictions eased as local dams filled, but Malaga and most
of the rest of the Costa del Sol will probably continue to suffer
restrictions.

NEW YORK MEETS STRONG OPPOSITION TO PROPOSED WATER ASSETS SALE

Since the 1970s, New York City (NYC), America's most populated city,
has struggled to balance a steadily eroding tax base against the rising
costs of providing municipal services to its eight million residents.
The scenario is increasingly duplicated in virtually all large cities
across the country. As part of the fiscal 1996 budget the Mayor
proposed transferring title to its water and sewer system assets to the
New York Water Board (NYWB) for $2.3bn.

The NYWB currently leases the water system from the city for a 40-year
term in return for lease and rental payments. NYWB was established as a
separate entity because state law prohibits a government agency from
issuing debt and at the same time setting rates and collecting user
fees, functions the NYWB performs. Although NYWB is considered semi-
independent, its seven members are appointed by the Mayor and its staff
are city employees.

Under the budget proposal, the NYWB will borrow money to make the
purchase, repaying over 30 years with revenues from water charges. The
city's Water Financing Authority (WFA), set up to finance the building
and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems, will issue about
$2.5 billion of revenue bonds (first and second resolution). NYC will
then retire or annul its current $1.3bn of outstanding general
obligation bonds originally issued for water and sewer projects before
NYWB was created. The balance of the sale price will be used over the
next four years for critical repairs to a broad range of infrastructure
costing about $200 million annually. It would also eliminate the much-
criticised $207 million tax receivables sale programme, under which the
city paid a bank to collect taxes and received an amount equal to those
taxes a year before their due date.

Capital assets involved in the sale are 18 reservoirs in three upstate
watersheds, thousands of miles of tunnels and mains, and 14 sewage
treatment plants. The price tag of $2.3bn was determined, not on the
value of plant beyond its construction cost, some of which is very old,
but on the projected lease payments the NYWB would make over the next
30 years, assuming a 7% interest rate. Although there is a school of
thought that believes the proposed sale price doesn't reflect the true
market value of the water system, which could be determined only by
competitive bidding, a majority of the city council oppose outright
privatisation.

Proponents of the proposal argue that it means an end to NYWB's
payments to the city. Eliminating these rent payments will provide
savings to hold down water rates. Water fees would be used to pay for
the bonds over 30 years, while the rent payments would be unending. The
sale is termed "rate neutral," and ratepayers will have new security
because the NYWB, instead of paying a continuing stream of rental
payments, will owe a finite payment over a defined length of time. NYC
could use the approximate $1bn for capital and other projects, money
that would have otherwise been borrowed at higher cost.

Opponents of the proposal are equally vehement, one of whom is the
city's own Comptroller. For months he has resisted pressure from the
Mayor and council to sign the documents necessary to execute the bond
transaction. He characterised the proposal as an "illegal gimmick."
"It's illegal," he claims, "because the WFA's authority does not extend
beyond borrowing for building and maintenance. It's `"gimmicky' because
we will pay for the water system twice." Because of statements the
Mayor has made, the Comptroller also believes some of the $1bn bond
revenue will be used to pay for operating expenses not covered by tax
revenue shortfalls. It was this very practice that brought NYC to the
brink of bankruptcy in the mid 1970s.

The New York Times has lined up with the opponents saying that "... the
legal issues are complicated and subject to differing interpretations.
But we continue to believe that it would be unwise public policy for
the city to sell a vast and valuable asset to pay for construction
projects over the next four years ... and the sale poses a potential
threat to the upstate reservoirs once control of all the system passes
from NYC ..."

There is concern that the state Governor, thought to be sympathetic to
greater development of upstate regions housing the reservoirs, could
change the NYWB composition and weaken the city's control of the three
watersheds that supply its raw water (FTWB, Issue 51, p6).

Municipal bond market operators have not forgotten that the city in
1975 was plunged into a fiscal crisis when the then mayor borrowed
millions to meet operating expenses. They are watching these recent
developments closely as experts were already voicing concerns about
NYC's existing debt level. In July 1995 Standard & Poors lowered the
city's credit rating in part because of this proposed sale.

Court decisions now awaited

In November the city council sued the city Comptroller in the New York
State Supreme Court. It has requested a declaratory judgment on the
Comptroller's authority over the issuance of WFA debt. A ruling is
expected in February.

In a further development on 11 December, a coalition of eight New York
City and Westchester County civic, housing and environmental
organisations filed suit in the State Supreme Court in Manhattan to
block the sale. Spearheading these opposing groups is the Natural
Resources Defence Council, a national environmental watchdog with a
staff of 150 and 170,000 members. Their suit alleges that the proposed
sale is illegal because the scheme would, among other things, divert
approximately $1bn in water and sewer monies for unrelated purposes.

ASEAN STATES PRESS CHINA TO CO-OPERATE ON MEKONG MANAGEMENT

Leaders of the seven Association of South East Asian Nations agreed to
push for the integrated development of the Mekong basin at their summit
in Bangkok. China, Laos, Burma and Cambodia will be invited to join a
regional forum with ASEAN to channel investment into the six nations
that depend upon the Mekong for much of their water supply, transport,
energy and agricultural needs.

"We require a more co-ordinated approach, after individual governments
and institutions have worked separately for the past few years. This
will be our first attempt at regional resource co-operation," Thai
prime minister Banharn Silapa-archa told the summit.

The move follows Burma's agreement to work with other riverine nations
in developing the basin. This left only China outside the Mekong River
Commission, a loose grouping of water users that is trying to promote
sustainable development of the Mekong. Burma has promised to attend
future meetings of the Commission, though only as an observer. Planning
minister Brigadier-General David Abel said at a Bangkok seminar that
Rangoon would join Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam in jointly
exploiting the river's potential. China is regarded as the prime
target, however, because the Mekong originates in Yunnan province and
one-quarter of the 4,200-kilometre river is in Chinese territory.

Financiers wary of funding further Chinese dams

"Beijing is under pressure from international (financial) institutions
to negotiate with downstream countries before they will put up any more
cash for dams. There's been too much bad feeling over their earlier
schemes," said a European banker based in Bangkok.

Water levels in the river dropped alarmingly in 1993 when China opened
Manwan dam, the first of eight reservoirs it is building on Mekong
tributaries, prompting protests from neighbouring countries.

The Commission is expected to press China for closer consultation on
water flows from the dams, especially with Laos and Vietnam. Land-
locked Laos needs ample water in the dry season to irrigate its rice
crops, and much of the country is now facing a famine because of
inadequate supplies. Vietnam depends upon high river levels to dilute
high saline levels in the Mekong delta, which is the country's main
food producer.

Initial response from the Chinese has not been too encouraging. Go Xin,
vice-manager of Yannan's Environmental Monitoring Centre, told the Thai
seminar that  "The Manwan dam will help purify the water by breaking
down pollutants and will stop erosion of the river bank. It has no
effect upon the water flow downstream."

NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT QUESTIONS AID FUNDING FOR DAM SCHEMES

NORAD, the Norwegian state development aid agency, has broken its own
rules regarding impartial evaluation of an African hydro power project
which is a candidate for development aid funding.

The project under scrutiny is the Lower Kihansi development in
Tanzania, being undertaken by Tanesco, a local utility. A Norwegian
firm, Norplan, has conducted both the technical and the environmental
analyses of the scheme, although NORAD guidelines say the companies
undertaking those functions should be quite independent of each other.

NORAD support for Lower Kihansi was being considered, earlier this
year, in connection with the possible participation in the project of
Norway's Kvaerner group. It was temporarily blocked on the advice of
NVE, the Norwegian state Water Resources and Energy Administration, and
of the Directorate for Natural Resources Management (DN), an arm of the
Environment Ministry. Both argued that Norplan's first environmental
analysis was inadequate, and that a new study was needed to decide if
aid was appropriate

A second study - again, by Norplan - was completed during the summer.
The Norwegian environmental newsletter N & M Bulletin says that NVE has
classified as "secret" all the documents connected with this latest
study, but the newsletter "understands" that the second analysis "is
just as poor as the first. The result could be a new rejection by DN
and ... NVE."

"In its first statement DN expressed great concern about the
environmental aspects of the hydro power scheme. In the affected area
there are many unique local species which could be completely
exterminated. The high waterfall in the river system creates... a
specially damp climate, which fosters a very rich fauna and flora.
Another concern relates to the consequences of road building through
the jungle, and the impact on the local population, which will feel the
pressure from thousands of workers and others connected with the huge
development."

Chile project also questioned

Norway's Environment Ministry is critical, too, of another giant hydro
project - Chile's Bio-Bio scheme - which has secured NORAD support. In
August last year - despite strong opposition from Norwegian
environmentalists - development aid minister Kari Nordheim-Larsen
announced that NORAD would provide so-called mixed credits for Bio-Bio.

The newsletter claims to have a copy of an internal Environment
Ministry memo which is highly critical of the project, casting it as an
example of a scheme that has been granted support without adequate
justification. The Ministry believes the aid decision was dubious and
suggests `bit by bit' tactics were used to aid an apparently limited
scheme that paved the way for a larger project

The same memo is sceptical towards third world hydro power projects
generally, pointing out that they "often have significant detrimental
effects both on the environment and on the population groups affected.
Far larger population groups, economic interests and environmental
values are affected, as a rule, than is the case with developments in
our part of the world."

JORDAN SAYS RED-DEAD LINK VITAL-ISRAEL NOT SO SURE

The Dead Sea lives down to its name. The only crops that grow around it
are fed by a few streams and what's left of the Jordan River after
everyone in the region has grabbed the bulk of the water and polluted
what's left. But regularly, there are heavy downpours on the hills that
flank its Eastern shore. These turn the usually light waters of the
Wadi Mujib into a raging torrent which pour through clefts in the rock
wall into the Dead Sea with only minimal entrapment by a water-short
population in Jordan's arid highlands of Moab.

The Jordanian Government is now promoting a scheme to trap the waters
of the Mujib and another nearby basin, the Hasa, to promote irrigated
development at the lower end of the Dead Sea where the Jordanian and
Israeli authorities intend to create the Lowest Park on Earth. Zafer al-
Alem, a senior official at the Ministry of Water and Irrigation, says
the Mujib and Hasa entrapment scheme, known by its local name as the
Southern Ghors, should ensure a net gain of 54m cubic metres (mcm) per
year.

The Southern Ghors Project is the smallest, but most immediate, of
Jordan's major water schemes. But in essence it only helps to postpone
hard decisions concerning water use and water availability. The
Jordanian authorities estimate that before they signed their Peace
Treaty with Israel in October 1994, their country's annual supply of
ground and surface water totalled only some 670mcm. And yet, according
to Mr. Qusei Qteishat, the Secretary General of the Ministry of Water
and Irrigation, by the year 2005 they will need 1,400mcm.

Zafer al-Alem estimates that some 215 mcm/year should come Jordan's way
as a result of the Treaty, partly by use of water stored in the Israeli-
 controlled Sea of Galilee, and partly from new dams on the Yarmuk
River that can go ahead given agreement between Israel and Jordan in
one case, and Jordan and Syria in the other. In addition, Jordan hopes
to complete a second priority project over the next seven years, the
transfer of water from the Disi aquifer in Southern Jordan, via a 310-
km pipeline; expected yield 80-100 mcm/y.

To make up the remaining 270 mcm/y it believes will be required by the
year 2005, the Ministry is planning an intensive campaign to re-use
existing water. But, as Zafer al- Alem told FTWB, "after ten years, the
problem will re-emerge. Then we will have to complete the Red-Dead
Canal."

But all these projects cost money and Jordan is not a rich country. The
relatively modest projects for the Southern Ghors are costed at
$254.2m, while the Disi pipeline, for which a feasibility study is
currently under way, is estimated at $405m. As for the Red Sea-Dead Sea
canal, this is costed at anything from $3.2bn upwards.

Detailed designs for the three dams in the Southern Ghors project at
Wala, Mujib and Tannur have already been completed, and detailed
designs for the Mujib weir and conveyer system, the largest single
element in the project, are due for completion in early 1996.

The Jordanians see the Southern Ghors as a progressive project, to be
implemented over an eight-year period. This should make it easier to
finance, since they are looking for three-quarters of the money to come
from foreign assistance, and donors generally prefer to disburse their
aid over a period of years.

Jordan also wants to improve the quality of its water. "We have
ambitious plans to clean the Jordan River, which receives a lot of
pollution," says Qteishat. "We plan to secure 10 mcm/y of desalinated
water from the springs around Tiberias (Sea of Galilee)," which he says
will be desalinated by Israel and passed on to Jordan. At present, he
says, "Israel pumps salt water out of Tiberias and passes it back to
the Jordan River. We want to make sure that no more waste water goes
into it."

Israel plans to do this by constructing what it calls a brine line from
Tiberias to the Dead Sea at a cost of $25.8 million. In addition, it
will also construct a desalination plant, possibly at Tabha, near some
brackish springs in the region, or else at Naharayim, near the border
with Jordan. Such a plant would cost around $23m and, overall, the
Israelis estimate the cost of desalination and improvement of water
quality in the Sea of Galilee as costing them a total of $98.9m over
the five years the project is expected to take. However, as well as
supplying Jordan with some 10mcm/y, a further 10-20mcm/y should be
available for Israeli consumption.

While Israel and Jordan are clearly committed in spirit, as well as in
law, to co-operating in the development of the Jordan Rift Valley, it
is clear that the level of cooperation can be expected to vary
considerably from project to project. The northern schemes are of
immediate benefit, and of generally definable and limited cost. The
practical benefits are also immediately obvious. One Jordanian
technologist involved in preparing his country's water plans, told FTWB
that Jordan expects to receive around 32 mcm/y of Israeli-sourced water
under the treaty. Almost all of this will be piped directly to Amman,
in effect providing almost one-third of the Jordanian capital's water
supply.

Given the tensions surrounding water issues in the Middle East,
Jordanian-Israeli co-operation on water management and development
since the 1994 peace treaty has been remarkable. Yet there are likely
to be some long term problems. The Jordanians are extremely keen on the
Red Sea-Dead Sea Canal which they genuinely appear to consider offers
the best prospect of meeting their additional water requirements in the
early 21st century. The project would yield an estimated 400 mcm/y
apiece to both Jordan and Israel, with desalination costs, Jordanian
officials aver, kept relatively low because the project can be powered
by the 400 metre level difference between the two seas.

However, it is equally clear that the Israelis are not so keen on the
project. One senior Israeli official told FTWB: "We consider this is a
dream. We want to see the economics clearly in place; so you can see
there is a difference of opinion" between Israel and Jordan.

To resolve such differences, the two countries have agreed to hire an
external consultant to report on the economics of the project. The
Jordanians hope the report will demonstrate the Canal's practicality
and financial viability. Since such a project would require massive
foreign aid, they are well aware that the Israelis will have to start
believing in it themselves if the scheme is to prove a success. For,
while aid donors may well be found if they see a real commitment from
both parties, scepticism from one partner is likely to produce
intensified scepticism amongst donors.

The key is whether Israel, which has more money to spend on developing
or importing alternative supplies, concludes that for political reasons
- continuing good relations with Jordan - it can gear itself up to
support the project with real enthusiasm. At present, this seems
unlikely. For Jordan, with less flexibility in terms of developing
alternative water sources, the project is considered vital if it is to
meet its most basic needs; for Israel there is no equivalent pressure.
As the Israeli official said: "We believe there is life without the Red
Sea-Dead Sea Canal."

AUCKLAND OPTS TO BOOST SUPPLIES WITH $55M PIPELINE FROM WAKATO RIVER

Auckland's Watercare Services has opted for a pipeline from the Waikato
River to meet future supply needs. In eliminating other options
Watercare is back to a plan very similar to an emergency proposal
floated at the height of a major drought in 1994. (FTWB, Issue 42, p2).

The water would be extracted from the river either by large diameter
bankside wells or infiltration galleries and pumped from the existing
Ardmore treatment station. The project will initially yield 80,000
cubic metres a day but would be designed to accommodate the possibility
of a second stage yielding 120,000 cubic metres per day around the year
2013.

The major difference over the previous emergency proposal is that this
project will have to go through normal planning permission processes.
The application to build the US$55m pipeline is likely to be filed in
March. It could take a year for all the consents to be granted,
following which there will be a 2 year construction period.  In the
meantime Watercare Services, which is a corporate entity owned by the
Auckland Regional Services Trust, is consulting local communities and
Maori tribes about the project.

Agreement of the Tainui tribe who claim ownership of the riverbed is
not a foregone conclusion. Nor is the agreement of all the local
authorities who will take the water. The Auckland district of Waitakere
City has considered going it alone with a combination of more efficient
water use and a dam project run by private enterprise.

Law changes will ease planning and funding negotiations

New legislation likely to be in place well before the process of
requesting planning permission starts will, however, make it easier for
Watercare Services to manage without the blessing of the receiving
local authorities  such as Waitakere.

Changes in the law will also provide more flexibility in selecting
funding options for this project and a major wastewater scheme. In
future, Watercare Services will be able to borrow commercially whereas
it currently has to give local authorities the right of first refusal
on whether to fund a project and it would be hard for it to proceed
without the backing of all the local authorities and loan guarantees
from them.

Watercare will in future also be authorised to reflect investment costs
in its pricing by including "the cost of its business requirements in
its prices and charges." At present it must set prices at a level which
recovers only the operating costs including interest and planned
maintenance and renewals.

Recent board changes at Watercare also mean the group is likely to be
more receptive to innovative finance proposals which involve private
operators, to the contracting out of services and buying in water from
other authorities rather than operating a closed shop monopoly.

SAO PAULO SETS LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR MAJOR WASTEWATER PROGRAMME

New water use legislation in Sao Paulo took a major step forward in
December with the approval of a master plan by the state council, a
consultative committee for the state assembly. The plan, Plano Estadual
de Recursos Hidricos, covers the period 1996 to 1999 and is based on
the user-pays principle and on the French model of administration
within river basin boundaries.The next step is for a detailed law to be
drawn up and voted on in the assembly.

Sao Paulo state has a population of 33 million and an area the size of
the United Kingdom. For the purposes of the water resources plan the
state has been divided into 22 river basin administrative areas.
Exploitation of state water resources, exclusive of treatment and
distribution, should have been charged for since 1991 according to
State Law 7.663 but this has so far been unenforced through lack of
complementary detailed legislation.

The first basin area to be created and where administration plans are
most advanced covers the Piracicaba, Capivari and Jundai rivers
situated just north of the Greater Sao Paulo connurbation. The basin
committee has already received $1.7m towards sanitation and water
supply schemes this year from a state fund, Fehidro, which comes from
royalty payments to areas flooded for hydroelectric schemes. Fehidro
should have $8.6m available for water schemes in 1996.

The Piracicaba/Capivari/Jundai Basin Committee, made up of
representatives from 57 municipalities and non-governmental
environmental organisations, has already held seven meetings and drawn
up a resources master plan for the period to 2010. Most watercourses
within the basin have, since 1977, been designated in the poor quality
classes 3 and 4 and currently serve only to dilute the polluting effect
of incoming waste waters. They are estimated to receive polluting loads
equivalent to a  biochemical oxygen demand of around 160 tonnes/day,
principally from sugar mills and other large industrial plants and a
domestic population of 2.2m.

The Plan envisages raising most of the rivers in this industrialised
area to class 2, drinking water standard, by 2010.

The Sao Paulo state government hopes to provide waste water treatment
for 80% of urban centres in the state by the year 2019. Currently only
5% of the state's waste water receives treatment.

Minas Gerais announces $825.3m, 4 year plan

Legal constraints do not appear to be affecting forward planning in
Minas Gerais where the state water company Copasa, Companhia de
Saneamento de Minas Gerais, has announced an ambitious $825.3m plan for
the period 1996-1999.

The principal element of Copasa's plan is the Prosam project involving
waste water treatment in state capital Belo Horizonte and the
depollution of the city's two main water courses, the Arruda and Onca.
This involves building a comprehensive main drainage system and two
large waste water treatment stations. Amongst other things the plan
envisages provision of 356,000 new water supply connections and 154,000
drain connections. The company hopes to cut drinking water supply
losses, currently the lowest in Brazil at 27%, down to 25%.

PWA CHIEF FACES SECOND INQUIRY OVER CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION

In a second indictment by the government within two months the head of
Thailand's Provincial Waterworks Authority (PWA) is to be investigated
over alleged mismanagement of a major contract.

In this instance the charge concerns late completion of a drinking
water contract. The PWA head, Visit Lorthirapong is said to have failed
to enforce punitive measures against the contractor involved in
installation of the Nong Khae district pumping station in central
Saraburi province. The work was completed 200 days late, incurring a
penalty of $720,000, but no fine was ever collected.

"If found guilty of abusing his authority by the auditor's office, the
PWA governor will face dismissal," said a spokesman for Deputy Interior
Minister Suchart Tancharoen, who ordered the investigation.

This is the second charge against Visit  since the current government
came to power in early July. He already faces investigation for
apparently defying an order by Suchart to delay the signing of a $160-
million contract for the Putham Thani water treatment plant. That
contract went to Thames Water International of the UK and Karnchang, a
Thai construction firm. According to industry reports, Suchart had
favoured a rival syndicate in the bidding. A review of the contract by
the Interior Ministry is nearing completion. Visit has told the inquiry
panel that he signed the contract because it had already been approved
by the former government of Chuan Leekpai.

Two unsuccessful bidders, led by Italian-Thai Development, Thailand's
largest construction group, and industrial estate operator MDX, lodged
official protests against the decision. Italian-Thai is known to have
close ties to Suchart's Chart Thai party, which forms the core of the
governing coalition.

Visit has been suspended since the row broke, and is not expected to
resume his post, even if he is cleared by the two investigations.

REPORT PROVIDES GOOD REFERENCE TO UK WATER COMPANY PERFORMANCE

Business Ratio Plus :Water Companies*   is probably the best collection
of publicly available information on water industry results collated
into one reference book.

The 1995 8th Edition covers the industry in England and Wales. For each
of the 10 regional water service plcs and the 20 or more water supply
companies it provides a range of good hard fact - contact details,
directors' names, turnover by subsidiaries, three full years' balance
sheets and profit and loss details. The core businesses of the 10 plcs
are treated to the same examination.

A reference work of this sort is  out-of-date as soon as it rolls off
the presses, as is the information it includes but, until an on-line
version is produced it's the best we can reasonably expect.

The latest figures relate to the year ending March '95 and the sector
has had interims, various bids and a long hot summer to cope with since
then. Further developments up to the end of the third quarter of 1995
are covered briefly in the Industry Comment section at the back of the
book. The performance analyses and league table positions are detailed
and avoid the need to work them out. The ratios, the meanings of which
are defined, are grouped into six categories; profitability, liquidity,
gearing, efficiency, employee performance and exports/sales. League
positions of the individual companies are ranked in the same way. Thus
at #1.17bn Thames Water plc had the highest turnover as at 31.3.95 and
produced the largest profit, #303.7m. Severn Trent employs 200 more
people than Thames and has the greatest total assets of #3.69bn.

Apart from Wessex Water which has a pre-tax profit margin of 51.1% none
of the Big 10 finds its way into the top five most profitable
companies. Indeed eight of them are below the water supply only
companies average gross margin of 31.6%. Does this prove that small is
beautiful when it comes to water companies? Investors may find this
analysis useful and industry players can keep an eye on what the others
are doing; it all depends on where your interest lies.

Business Ratio Plus :Water Companies  does not go into the unregulated
businesses in any greater detail than to list their turnover. In the
long run this may be where the real differences and investor interest
arise. For that we will need annual reports, latest interims and a lot
more specific company research but as far as it goes this is an
excellent basic handbook to the water industry in England and Wales.

SOUTHERN AND BRISTOL WATER COMPLETE INTERIMS REPORTING SEASON IN UK

Southern Water plc, the last of the big 10 to report at the interim
stage, is showing turnover up to #206.9 million from #190.6 million
last year.

The massive retained profit of #58.7 million, or 28.37% of turnover,
continues a trend. The comparable figure was #86.9 million or 22.59% of
sales for the full year to 31 March and #52.5 million or 27.5% at the
half way stage in 1994. It is not surprising then that Southern intends
to buy back its shares although it might have been more imaginative and
expanded the business rather than shrinking it.

In fact it intends to fund the exercise by increasing the dividend by
year end so that the total cost to the company will be the same as
buying its own shares. Even so by then funds in the share premium
account and reserves look set to exceed #1bn

In addition to "returning value to shareholders" Southern also intends
to defer the permitted 1% price increase for 1996/7 and bring in a
"customer benefit programme" costing #50 million. This will go towards
"discretionary" spending on "distribution, foul water flooding and
odour control."

If Southern can achieve all this in such a drought year, with only a
hose-pipe ban by way of emergency measures, is it charging too much for
its services or investing too little in the infrastructure? Southern
may end up being praised for its prudence but like other suppliers the
1996 outlook may depend on the extent of winter rains.

Bristol Water Holdings plc increased turnover to #33.16 million from
#31.31 million this time last year. Operating profits were up to #8.25
million from #6.54 million in 1994 when they took into account a #1.1
million re-reorganisation provision. This has now fed through to the
bottom line of #4.78 million and retained profit of #3.75 million.

Hopefully this will help ease net borrowings which still run at 68% of
total shareholders' funds. At the full year they had been 91% and at
the interim stage last year 87%.

Meanwhile shareholders' funds have crept up from #43.5 million to #47.7
million since 31st March 1995 year end suggesting a move from debt to
equity financing although without full view of the underlying numbers
this cannot be verified.

Bristol still has large capital projects to fund, particularly the
Gloucester to Sharpness Canal which it estimates will cost #2 million
by the end of the century.

Following restructuring and reduction of the workforce by 15% perhaps
Bristol is set fair for improved results at the full year.

EIB LENDS ECU100M VIA POLISH BANKS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE SCHEMES

A credit line of ECU100m advanced by the European Investment Bank to
four foreign banks operating in Poland -  ABN-AMRO, Creditanstalt, ING
Bank, and Raiffeisen-Centrobank - is intended broadly for use on
`infrastructure' projects.

An EIB spokesman told FTWB the intended coverage could range from
installing telephone lines to building tourist facilities, but
environmental projects, including water/wastewater treatment schemes
would certainly qualify. Individual loans could range from ECU20,000 to
ECU 25m. depending on the intermediary bank chosen.

The loans would be relatively cheap, with interest charged at 150 basis
points (1.5%) over Libor (London interbank offered rate), and repayment
over up to 11 years.

The EIB raises market funds as cheaply as anybody, given its AAA rating
as a supranational institution. Furthermore, by lending through foreign
banks, the EIB has been able to obtain guarantees from the foreign
banks' parents in Amsterdam or Vienna, thereby avoiding the
complications of extracting a government guarantee from the Polish
authorities, as would have been needed in the case of a Polish bank. By
lending through one single intermediary, the EIB has kept to a minimum
the number of margins that must be added to the basic cost of the
money.

AMORIM BUYS MAJOR SHARE IN LUSAGUA

The Amorim group, Portugal's biggest cork products group and one of the
country's largest business conglomerates, has acquired 50% of Lusagua,
a water company, previously wholly owned by two Spanish groups, Aguas
de Barcelona and Canal Isabel.

The acquisition, made by increasing Lusagua's capital from Es100m
($150,000) to Es200m, represents an important diversification for the
Amorim group. The two Spanish companies retain the remaining 50%. The
acquisition was made shortly after Lusagua, in association with another
company, Aquagest, was awarded a concession to manage the water supply
and waste water treatment systems of Carvoeiro, the name given to a
group of municipalities centred on Aveiro in northern Portugal.

MINISTERS PLAN INCREASED SPENDING ON WATER AND WASTEWATER SYSTEMS

A total of $60 million has been allocated for provincial waste water
treatment plants in Thailand this year (1996), double the 1995
expenditure. Included in an $84-million environmental fund, the money
will be allocated under 1992 legislation that requires provincial
governments to formulate local action plans.

"The funding has been raised substantially because of the heavy
response from provincial administrations. There are at least five
municipalities that will begin waste water treatment plants (in 1996),"
said Saksit Tridej, a senior official in the Environment Ministry.

While the funding comes from the national government, local authorities
must conduct feasibility studies and provide land for the plants. The
system reverses a previous trend of centralised planning from Bangkok.

"It's a very effective method, as the government can allocate budgets
to local agencies to tackle pressing environmental problems," said
Saksit. "They are in a better position to know what is needed that we
are."

Resource studies planned in East and West provinces

Elsewhere the Industry Ministry has called for feasibility studies on
improvement of supplies to factories in the eastern and western
provinces following complaints from manufacturers.

Industry minister Chaiwat Sinsuwong said East Water, a partially
privatised water distributor, would be commissioned to overcome
shortages affecting much of the eastern seaboard, including supplies to
state-run industrial estates.

"The supplies need to be improved but also the pricing. Everyone is
complaining that piped water is too expensive in these two areas," he
said. "What may be needed is better resource management."

Efforts to boost supplies have been thwarted by a shortage of suitable
sites for reservoirs; the government is considering importing water
from Cambodia if new domestic sources cannot be found.

FRENCH GROUPS COMBINE IN BID FOR CONTROL OF MID-KENT WATER

Generale des Eaux's British subsidiary General Utilities, and its
Bouygues Group counterpart Saur Water Services have announced that they
intend to launch a takeover bid for the UK`s Mid Kent Water.

The French have indicated an offer of #4.40 a share, valuing Mid Kent
at some #80m ($126m). But the bid will have to await the approval of
the UK's Monopolies and Mergers Commission. This is not likely to be a
stumbling block, given the recent approval of the much more significant
bid by Lyonnaise des Eaux for the regional water and sewage utility,
Northumbrian Water. One difficulty might arise however from the advice
of the Mid-Kent board that shareholders should reject the bid.

The two French-owned companies already hold 39% of Mid Kent, but would
like control.  General Utilities already owns Folkestone and Dover
Water which serves the area adjacent to Mid-Kent on the east side,
while Saur Water Services controls South East Water to  the west of Mid-
Kent.

Generale and Saur say a takeover would optimise water usage in the area
and thereby reduce the risk of water shortages.

South East Water is the largest of the three companies with 618,000
clients and an annual turnover of #50.9m. Mid Kent serves  525,000
users and Folkestone and Dover, annual turnover #10.4m, serves
151,000.

In all, General Utilities provides water for 3.1m persons in the UK via
four companies, while Saur Water Services provides for 1.3m persons via
two companies.

UWR TO PARTNER JERSEY CITY FOR WATER SYSTEM OPERATION

United Water Resources (UWR), America's second largest investor-owned
water services company, on 11 December won the contract to manage the
water system of Jersey city, an industrial community across the Hudson
River from the tip of Manhattan Island. Population to be served is
about 240,000.

The contract is subject to public hearings and approval of the New
Jersey state public utility. UWR anticipates a successful outcome of
the approval process and is scheduling a start this Spring. It will be
the largest public-private partnership for a municipal water operation
in the country.

The company says the proposal will bring major economic benefits to
Jersey City over five years through operating efficiencies, improved
billing, job creation, plus the purchase of Jersey City's excess water
supplies.

UWR is a holding company whose subsidiaries engage in water-related
businesses, real estate, and environmental testing. It provides water
and wastewater services to about two million people in 13 states.

WORLD BANK TO FUND $13.5M STUDY FOR REGION'S LARGEST DAM

The World Bank has agreed to fund the second stage of a feasibility
study for the Son La hydro-electric dam in Vietnam, which will be the
largest to be constructed in Southeast Asia.

Bradley Babson, spokesman for the Bank's mission in Hanoi, said the
involvement was conditional upon Vietnam using a recognised level of
design and construction and protecting ethnic minorities who live in
the area. "We are not financing the dam, but we may provide funds to
make sure that they do the studies for the dam in a way that will fit
international standards," he said. Expected to take two years, the
$13.5m study will look at the environmental impact and social
repercussions from the relocation of thousands of local residents.

An earlier study by Sweden's Sweco consultancy found that the project
was economically viable, and recommended two sites on the Black River,
a tributary of the Red River in northern Hanoi.

Expected to have an electricity output of up to 3,794 megawatts, the
project will be twice the size of Hoa Binh dam, 190 kilometres
downstream, which is currently the largest in the region.

Meanwhile, construction of a $110-million hydro-power plant has started
at Song Hinh in central Phu Yen province. Work on a series of dams with
a power output of 370 million kilowatt hours began in 1991.

USCG STRIKES A COMPROMISE IN FINAL OSRO GUIDELINES

In a compromise between the conflicting concerns of the nation's
two largest oil spill removal organizations (OSROs), the
U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) has issued final guidelines on a revamped
OSRO classification process that will require response
organizations to maintain "redundant" quantities of any
contracted or "nondedicated" response resources that they wish to
count toward their classifications. In the weeks preceding the
release of the final guidelines, the National Response Corp.
(NRC) and the Marine Spill Response Corp. (MSRC) expressed very
different views regarding the way that the revamped
classification system should count nondedicated resources (OPB,
15 Dec. 1995, p.1). MSRC, whose response network consists
primarily of owned or "dedicated" response resources, argued that
nondedicated resources should not be counted toward an OSRO's
classification unless the OSRO can demonstrate the ability to
deploy those resources in a timely manner. In contrast, NRC,
which makes extensive use of nondedicated equipment and
personnel, contended that, for classification purposes, dedicated
and nondedicated resources should be considered equivalent.

Under the final guidelines, an OSRO may count nondedicated
resources as part of its response capability, but it must arrange
for access to at least twice as much nondedicated equipment and
personnel as it needs to meet the guidelines' response resource
standards. "If an OSRO elects to use nondedicated resources,
there must be a redundancy factor of 2 to 1," USCG wrote in the
final guidelines. "This means that the OSRO must ensure the
availability of nondedicated response resources by contract or
other approved means in quantities equal to twice what the OSRO"
would be required to maintain if those same resources were
dedicated, according to USCG. "Ideally, dedicated resources
provide more of a timely response 'guarantee' than nondedicated
resources," Admiral James Card explained in a cover letter
accompanying the final guidelines. However, "historically, the
response industry has depended to varying degrees on nondedicated
resources to perform some critical response functions," according
to Admiral Card. "To better ensure the availability of these
nondedicated resources, we have required a redundancy factor of
2 to 1 when using nondedicated response resources," Admiral Card
wrote.

USCG's decision to require a 2 to 1 redundancy factor for
nondedicated resources appears to be acceptable to NRC, but not
to MSRC. "Everyone was waiting to see how USCG would handle the
issue of dedicated and nondedicated resources," NRC President
Mark Miller told OPB. "I think they have reached a compromise
that addresses the concerns of all of the parties involved,"
Miller said. "With the tremendous inventory of dedicated and
nondedicated resources that NRC has available, I fully expect
that the program we developed several years ago will stand up
under the new classification system," Miller said. MSRC Corporate
Relations Director Greg Rixon told OPB that, although "redundant
contracts may increase the likelihood that nondedicated resources
will be available in the event of a spill, MSRC still believes
that the only way to positively ensure response capability is to
maintain dedicated resources." In addition, MSRC contends that a
redundancy factor of 2 to 1 does not provide sufficient assurance
of equipment availability, according to Rixon. "In our opinion,
USCG would be close to achieving a reasonable assurance of
availability with a redundancy factor of 3 to 1, and would
probably reach full assurance with a factor of 4 to 1," Rixon
said.

OSRO classification background: USCG classifies OSROs to help
vessel and facility owners select organizations that are capable
of meeting their response planning requirements under the Oil
Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90). Section 4202 of OPA 90 requires
vessel and facility owners to develop response plans that
"identify and ensure, by contract or other means, the
availability of private personnel and equipment necessary to
remove, to the maximum extent practicable, a worst-case
discharge." The OSRO classification process is voluntary;
response organizations are not required to apply for OSRO
classification. Although vessel and facility owners do not have
to contract with classified OSROs to meet the OPA 90 planning
requirements, plan holders who rely on classified OSROs are
exempted from the requirement to document in their plans all of
the response resources that they intend to contract in the event
of a spill.

The newly released final OSRO classification guidelines replace
those contained in Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular
(NVIC) No. 12-92, which USCG issued in December 1992 (OPB,
18 Dec. 1992., p.2). "After the implementation of NVIC No. 12-92,
weaknesses were identified in the classification process that
prevented the program from realistically representing the
response capabilities of an OSRO," Admiral Card explained in the
cover letter for the final guidelines. USCG held public workshops
in January 1994 and June 1995 to solicit comments on the OSRO
classification process and, during September 1995, issued draft
guidelines on a revamped system (OPB, 22 Sept. 1995, p.1).
According to Admiral Card, USCG received written comments on the
draft guidelines from about 70 organizations during the public
comment period, which ended on 30 November 1995. "As a result of
the comments received, and our own review, the draft guidelines
have undergone many changes," Card noted. He claimed that the
final guidelines will allow USCG to "accurately and consistently
calculate an OSRO's capability to respond to specific plan holder
requirements."

"We continue to stress that using a USCG-classified OSRO does not
in any way relieve plan holders of the responsibility to ensure
that their specific response needs are met," Card wrote in his
cover letter. "The revised classification guidelines provide a
good indication of an OSRO's response capability by COTP zone,"
Card noted. The OSRO classifications "do not, however, represent
a 'one size fits all' solution," Card wrote. "USCG created the
voluntary OSRO classification program so that facility and vessel
response plan holders could list USCG-evaluated OSROs in lieu of
providing voluminous detailed lists of response resources,"
according to Admiral Card. "This was, and still is, the only
regulatory benefit that plan holders receive from utilizing USCG-
classified OSROs," Admiral Card explained.

Final OSRO classification process: Although USCG has included new
requirements for nondedicated resources and other changes in the
final guidelines, the final classification process is very
similar to that outlined in the draft guidelines proposed during
September 1995. Like the draft guidelines, the final guidelines
specify that USCG will enter information about each OSRO's
response resources into a database--the Response Resource
Inventory--and then use a computer program to classify the
organization. The program will assign each response organization
"geographic-specific" classifications--that is, separate
classifications for each Captain of the Port (COTP) zone in which
the organization operates. According to USCG, the computer
program will automatically take into account an OSRO's ability to
transport or "cascade" its resources in response to spills
outside of the COTP zones in which the equipment is stored.

For each COTP zone, USCG will assign a response organization one
of five OSRO classifications ranging from A (least capacity) to
E (most capacity) in any or all of the following operating
environments: rivers and canals, inland regions, the Great Lakes,
and oceans. The five classifications will reflect both an
organization's ability to deploy equipment within certain time
frames and its effective daily recovery capacity (EDRC)--a
function of the amount of boom, oil recovery equipment, and
temporary storage that the OSRO can access during a spill
response. For example, to receive a class C rating in the inland
operating environment of a particular COTP zone, an OSRO would
have to have an EDRC of 10,000 barrels per day. In addition, that
OSRO would have to be capable of mounting a spill response in
that COTP zone within the following time frames: 6 hours for a
spill from a facility in a high-volume port; 12 hours for a
facility spill in a non-high-volume port; 12 hours for a spill
from a vessel in a high-volume port; and 24 hours for a vessel
spill in a non-high-volume port.

Like the draft OSRO classification process, the final OSRO
classification process takes into account not only an
organization's total response resources, but also its ability to
deploy various types of response equipment together as a
"system." According to both the draft and the final guidelines,
an organization's EDRC will be determined by the least-capable
component of its oil recovery system. For example, if an OSRO has
a temporary storage capacity of 30,000 barrels per day, but has
skimming or vacuum equipment that is capable of recovering only
10,000 barrels per day, the OSRO's EDRC will be limited to
10,000 barrels per day. During the classification process, USCG
may consider any of the following additional factors: the
availability of trained personnel to operate the organization's
equipment; the suitability of the OSRO's equipment for the
environments in which it operates; the organization's ability to
provide logistical support for a spill response; and the OSRO's
ability to use response techniques other than mechanical recovery
methods.

Changes from the draft process: Based on the comments received on
the draft guidelines, USCG made several revisions to the final
OSRO classification process. The final guidelines give each OSRO
the option to apply for classifications in a particular COTP zone
based on its resources in a city in the zone other than the city
in which the COTP office is located. In contrast, the draft
guidelines would have counted only the resources in the COTP
city. In the draft guidelines, USCG specifically stated that the
temporary storage capacity used to calculate an OSRO's EDRC would
"not include fixed, shore-based storage capacity." However, in
the final guidelines, USCG revised this policy. "An OSRO that
operates in an area where fixed storage is a realistic asset may
claim fixed storage as meeting part of its temporary storage
requirement," according to USCG. When determining whether to
count fixed storage, "the key factor that USCG will evaluate is
whether the temporary storage that an OSRO has identified will
allow the OSRO to sustain its classified EDRC throughout spill
response operations," the agency noted.

Under the draft guidelines, USCG would have evaluated an OSRO's
ability to dispose of recovered oil as part of the classification
process, but this criterion has been omitted from the final
guidelines. In addition, in the draft guidelines, USCG did not
address whether OSROs could receive credit for response resources
designated to meet state resident-equipment requirements.
However, in the final guidelines, USCG noted that "OSROs that
have designated equipment to meet state resident-equipment
requirements must indicate this on their OSRO application."
According to USCG, "for classification purposes, designated
resident equipment is not cascadable outside of the area for
which it is designated." As under the draft guidelines, OSROs
classified under the final guidelines will be reevaluated every
three years to verify that their classifications are accurate.
The final guidelines also specify that USCG will conduct "random
spot checks" between each regularly scheduled reinspection visit
"to confirm resource availability and equipment operability."

Reaction from NRC and MSRC: In separate interviews with OPB about
the final OSRO classification process, NRC and MSRC both
commented on the importance of dedicated resources to the
nation's overall spill response capability. To illustrate MSRC's
perspective, Rixon compared USCG's response planning regulations
to a high-jump competition. "Congress and USCG initially set the
bar at a certain height," according to Rixon. "USCG then
discovered that only one company--MSRC--could clear the bar,"
Rixon claimed. "Rather than say to everyone else, you must train
harder to compete in this event, USCG decided to lower the bar,"
according to Rixon. "We are not the only organization with
dedicated resources, but we did acquire a higher percentage of
dedicated resources than any other organization, and we did that
at great cost to our clients," Rixon explained. "When NRC and
other companies wanted to get into the game, they decided not to
spend the kind of money that we spent," according to Rixon. "In
fact, these companies realized that they could gain a competitive
edge by not acquiring as many dedicated resources," Rixon said.

By failing to fully recognize the limitations of nondedicated
resources in the OSRO classification system, USCG "has placed the
whole concept of dedicated resources in grave jeopardy," Rixon
claimed. "The end of dedicated resources will not come like a
thunderclap," according to Rixon. "Tomorrow, we will not wake up
and find that all of this country's dedicated response resources
are gone, but they will erode slowly, and eventually no OSROs
will have them," Rixon said. "Then, at some time in the future,
USCG will try to execute the response plans that are in place,
and they will discover that the dedicated assets that they were
relying on are not there any more," Rixon said. "We believe that
USCG must take steps to ensure that dedicated assets remain in
place or that nondedicated resources are maintained in sufficient
numbers so that there is some degree of certainty that enough
equipment and personnel will be available when a major spill
occurs," Rixon said. In addition, "USCG must improve its efforts
to test and evaluate the capability of OSROs on a true no-notice
basis, especially those OSROs that rely on nondedicated
resources," according to Rixon.

According to NRC's Miller, "there is no proof that dedicated
equipment is more reliable than nondedicated equipment during a
spill response." Miller pointed out that "NRC has responded
successfully to 85 oil spills," whereas "MSRC does not have that
kind of track record." Therefore, MSRC "can only guess that their
dedicated resources might be better in a spill response," Miller
said. He noted that, "at a time when most of MSRC's customers are
doing away with their owned and dedicated tanker fleets and
regularly chartering ships on the spot market, it seems curious
to me that MSRC does not recognize the hypocrisy of advocating
dedicated resources for spill response." According to Miller,
"MSRC went out and spent a lot of money on dedicated equipment,
and as a result, they have saddled their customers with a
tremendous expense and an ungainly organization." In contrast,
"NRC looked at the marketplace, purchased equipment as needed,
saw that nondedicated resources were available, and developed a
better program for our customers," Miller said. For a copy of the

NOAA ADOPTS RESTORATION-BASED NRDA PROCESS IN FINAL RULE

On 5 January, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) issued its long-awaited final rule
specifying the methods that federal, state, and tribal trustees
are authorized to use when conducting natural resource damage
assessments (NRDAs) under OPA 90. The NRDA process described in
the final rule is essentially the same as the "restoration-based"
approach outlined in NOAA's "reproposed" NRDA rule, which the
agency issued during August 1995 (OPB, 11 Aug. 1995, p.1). Under
the final rule, which will take effect on 5 February, the NRDA
process will focus on determining the appropriate scale of the
restoration projects required to "make the environment and the
public whole" following a spill. The trustees for the natural
resources injured by an oil spill will evaluate the injuries
caused by the spill and develop a detailed plan for returning the
injured resources to their baseline condition and compensating
the public for the lost use of those resources while they are
being restored. The responsible parties (RPs) will then either
fund or implement the restoration plan.

The restoration-based NRDA approach contained in the final rule
and in NOAA's August 1995 proposal differs significantly from the
process that the agency outlined in its first proposed NRDA rule
during January 1994 (OPB, 15 Jan. 1994, p.1). Under that original
proposed rule, the NRDA process would have focused on assessing
the monetary value of the natural resources injured by an oil
spill. The RPs would then have been required to pay the
calculated sum to the trustees, who would have used it to restore
or replace the injured natural resources. The January 1994
proposal was sharply criticized by representatives of the marine
insurance and oil transportation industries, who argued that the
methods it proposed for calculating natural resource values were
arbitrary and therefore might lead to grossly inflated damage
claims under OPA 90. The critics of the January 1994 proposed
rule were particularly concerned about its inclusion of the
controversial contingent-valuation method, which involves the use
of surveys to determine the "passive use" values of natural
resources. Passive use values are the values that people attach
to resources that they do not use but that they nevertheless
regard as important to preserve.

Like NOAA's August 1995 proposal, the final NRDA rule defines a
more limited role for contingent valuation and other valuation
methods than the role outlined in NOAA's January 1994 proposal.
The final rule limits the use of valuation techniques to specific
circumstances and states that these techniques may be used only
to determine the appropriate scale of natural resource
restoration projects. The use of contingent valuation and other
valuation methods for this purpose "avoids many problems
identified by commenters regarding the use of continent valuation
to calculate a dollar value" for natural resource damages, as
specified in the January 1994 proposed rule, NOAA stated in the
final rule. According to NOAA, under the final rule, RPs are
liable for the cost of implementing restoration actions that
generate value equivalent to the lost value of the injured
natural resources, not for reimbursing the trustees for the
calculated lost value of the resources.

NOAA's decision to limit the role of valuation methods in the
August 1995 proposed rule alarmed environmental groups, who
claimed that, by switching from the original valuation-based
approach to a restoration-based approach, the proposal would fail
to fully compensate the public for the inherent value of natural
resources. These groups argued that, by giving RPs the option to
undertake restoration projects instead of paying economic damages
following a spill, the proposal would ultimately lead to lower
recoveries for the public. Insurance companies and shipping
organizations also criticized the August 1995 proposed rule.
These groups claimed that, although the proposal focused the NRDA
process on determining the scale of restoration actions, it
provided only general guidance on NRDAs and would therefore give
trustees the option to use a wider variety of assessment methods.

In the preamble to the final rule, NOAA defended the restoration-
based NRDA approach. According to NOAA, by requiring trustees to
assess natural resource injuries for the purpose of determining
the required scale of restoration activities, the final NRDA
process will "validate trustee determinations regarding those
actions that will make the environment and public whole." In
addition, NOAA noted that, while the final rule "provides for the
use of a range of appropriate and cost-effective assessment
procedures," the rule also includes a set of standards that any
assessment procedure must meet. For example, the rule specifies
that assessment procedures must be "capable of providing
information of use in determining the type and scale of
restoration appropriate for a particular injury" and must be
"reliable and valid for the particular incident." NOAA also said
that, because the final rule gives RPs and the public
opportunities to participate in the restoration planning process,
"restoration will be achieved more quickly, transaction costs
will decrease, and litigation will be avoided."

NRDA rulemaking history: The publication of the final NRDA rule
came more than five years after NOAA first issued an advance
notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register to solicit
comments on approaches for conducting NRDAs under OPA 90 (OPB,
18 Jan. 1991, p.1). Since that time, NOAA has published eleven
Federal Register notices related to the NRDA process, including
its first proposed NRDA rule during January 1994, the August 1995
reproposed rule, and the final NRDA rule. In addition, NOAA has
held numerous public workshops and regional meetings during the
past five years to solicit input on the various methods that have
been developed to assess natural resource damages. According to
NOAA, the final rule draws on the comments received and provides
"a NRDA process intended to meet OPA 90's goal of expeditious,
cost-effective, and feasible restoration of natural resources and
services injured by incidents involving oil."

Although the final rule was published in the Federal Register on
5 January, NOAA submitted the rule to the Federal Register office
on 28 December 1995, thereby meeting the deadline specified in a
consent decree that the agency reached last year with the Natural
Resources Defense Council (NRDC). The consent decree resolved a
suit filed during 1994 by NRDC and eight other environmental
groups against NOAA for failing to promulgate a final NRDA rule
by 18 August 1992, as required under OPA 90 (OPB, 4 Nov. 1994,
p.2). Under the consent decree, NOAA agreed to file its
reproposed NRDA rule with the Federal Register by 31 July 1995,
and to file the final rule on approaches for conducting NRDAs by
31 December 1995. The agency met both deadlines.

Final NRDA rule: Like the August 1995 proposed rule, the final
rule divides the NRDA process following an oil spill into three
phases: preassessment, restoration planning, and restoration
implementation. In the first phase--preassessment--the trustees
must determine whether the spill warrants a complete NRDA. Based
on the information available, the trustees must determine whether
the incident may have resulted in any injuries or any risk of
injuries to natural resources under their trusteeship and
therefore whether the incident qualifies for a natural resource
damage claim under OPA 90. In addition, the trustees must
evaluate whether the emergency spill response operations will
eliminate the threat of ongoing injuries to natural resources.
"If injuries are expected to continue, and feasible restoration
alternatives exist to address such injuries, the trustees may
proceed with the assessment," NOAA explained in the rule.

The second phase of the NRDA process--restoration planning--has
two components: injury assessment and restoration selection.
According to NOAA, "the goal of the injury assessment is to
determine the nature and extent of the injuries to natural
resources and services, thus providing a technical basis for
evaluating the need for, type of, and scale of restoration
actions." Under the final rule, natural resource injuries are
defined as any "observable or measurable change in a natural
resource" or any "impairment of a natural resource service." As
part of the injury assessment, the trustees must determine first
that natural resources have been exposed to the spilled oil, and
second that this exposure has caused an injury. By comparing the
condition of the injured resources to their baseline condition,
the trustees must quantify the degree and spatial extent of the
injuries and estimate their temporal extent.

After the injury assessment is completed, the trustees begin the
restoration selection process, which involves the identification,
evaluation, and selection of various restoration alternatives.
Under the final rule, the trustees must identify a "reasonable
range" of restoration alternatives, including both "primary
restoration actions," which are designed to help restore the
injured natural resources to their baseline condition, and
"compensatory restoration actions," which are intended to
compensate the public for the lost use of natural resources
during the restoration period. The final rule specifically states
that trustees must consider "natural recovery" as a primary
restoration option. In addition, the trustees may consider
actions intended to prevent interference with natural recovery or
more intensive actions that they believe would return injured
resources to their baseline condition more rapidly or with
greater certainty than natural recovery. When identifying
possible compensatory restoration actions, trustees are required
first to consider those actions that provide services of the same
type and quality as those lost as a result of the spill. If the
trustees cannot identify a reasonable range of this type of
compensatory actions, they may consider other compensatory
actions, provided that these actions make available services of
comparable type and quality to those lost.

To ensure that the restoration actions identified by the trustees
appropriately address the injuries arising from the incident, the
trustees must "scale" the actions. The final rule specifies two
approaches for determining the appropriate scale of a restoration
action: the "resource-to-resource" or "service-to-service"
approach, and the "valuation" approach. In the resource-to-
resource or service-to-service approach, the trustees determine
the quantity of resources or services that have been lost and
identify actions that provide at least an equal quantity of
replacement resources or services of the same type and quality as
those lost. In the valuation approach, the trustees use valuation
methods, such as contingent valuation, to calculate the value of
the resources or services lost as a result of the spill and to
determine the value expected to be gained from the various
restoration actions under consideration. The trustees then scale
the restoration actions so that they provide resources or
services of equal value to those lost. The final rule states that
trustees may use the valuation approach only if they are
considering actions that provide resources or services of a
different type and quality from those lost, or if the resource-
to-resource or service-to-service approach is inappropriate.

Once the trustees have identified a reasonable range of
restoration alternatives, they must select the "preferred"
alternatives. When selecting the preferred alternatives, the
trustees are required under the rule to consider the following
factors: 1) the cost of each alternative; 2) the extent to which
each alternative is expected to return the injured natural
resources and services to their baseline condition or to
compensate the public for the loss of resources and services
during the interim period; 3) the likelihood that each
alternative will be successful; 4) the extent to which each
alternative will prevent further natural resource injuries from
the spill and avoid collateral injuries during implementation;
5) the extent to which each alternative benefits more than one
natural resource or service; and 6) the effect of each
alternative on public health and safety. Under the final rule,
the trustees must select the most cost-effective of two or more
equally preferable alternatives. The trustees then develop a
draft restoration plan presenting the preferred alternatives and
make the draft plan available for public review and comment.
After reviewing the comments, the trustees develop a final
restoration plan.

In the third phase of the NRDA process--restoration
implementation--the trustees present the final plan to the RPs,
who must either implement the plan themselves or provide the
funding for the trustees to implement it. According to NOAA, the
restoration implementation phase provides an opportunity in the
NRDA process for the settlement of natural resource damage claims
without litigation, because the trustees and the RPs can
negotiate the best way to proceed with the restoration plan. If
the RPs refuse to fund or implement the final restoration plan,
the trustees are authorized under OPA 90 to file a civil suit
against the RPs in federal court to recover the cost of
implementing the plan. If the response costs and natural resource
damages arising from a spill exceed the RP's liability limit
under OPA 90, or if no RP has been identified, the trustees may
seek funding for the restoration from the Oil Spill Liability
Trust Fund.

Under OPA 90, NRDAs performed by federal, state, or tribal
trustees in accordance with the procedures contained in the final
rule "have the force and effect of a rebuttable presumption on
behalf of the trustees in any judicial or administrative
proceedings." In the final rule, NOAA interpreted this
presumption to mean that "the RP has the burden of presenting
alternative evidence on damages and of persuading the fact finder
that the damages presented by the trustees are not an appropriate
measure" of the natural resource injuries caused by a spill. If,
in any portion of an assessment, the trustees use procedures that
are determined not to be in accordance with the final rule, the
trustees will not receive the rebuttable presumption for that
portion of the assessment. In addition, NRDAs performed by
foreign trustees in accordance with the final rule are not
entitled to the rebuttable presumption.

NOAA's response to comments on earlier NRDA proposals: In the
final rule, NOAA noted that it "has made every effort to
consider" all of the comments that it received on the NRDA
proposals issued in January 1994 and August 1995, as well as the
comments submitted at the agency's public workshops and meetings
on NRDA issues. Of the 71 Federal Register pages in the final
rule, 37 pages are devoted to addressing comments. "Many
commenters supported the shift in focus from monetization of
damages to scaling of restoration actions" under the August 1995
proposal, NOAA said. "These commenters stated that the reproposed
rule properly placed the focus of the NRDA process on the
ultimate goal of OPA 90--to restore injured natural resources and
services," the agency said. However, according to NOAA, "many
other commenters raised concerns that the restoration approach
would lead to delays and increased assessment costs, since
trustees would have to undertake studies of both lost services
and replacement services." In addition, "several commenters
argued that the August 1995 proposal was significantly weaker
than the January 1994 proposal, with no justification except
industry pressure for an untested restoration-based approach
instead of the well-tested and supported economic valuation
procedures," according to NOAA. Other commenters characterized
the restoration-based NRDA approach as "an untried theory" that
"might be better or worse" than the valuation-based approach
originally proposed, NOAA said.

In defense of the restoration-based NRDA process, NOAA noted
that, under OPA 90, "all damages recovered must be spent on some
restoration activity." Therefore, the NRDA process should focus
on evaluating potential restoration actions, NOAA said. "It does
not benefit the natural resources or the public if monies are
collected without a view toward how they will be spent, nor
whether sufficient funds have been collected to implement any
meaningful restoration actions," according to NOAA. The agency
claimed that, "contrary to some comments, the restoration
approach will generally speed restoration and avoid litigation,
by alleviating distrust that claims for monetary damages are
speculative and punitive." According to NOAA, "practical
experience in implementing the restoration scaling approach in
past cooperative assessments suggests that this approach is
effective in significantly expediting the restoration of injured
natural resources and services." The agency added that "these
benefits to the environment and public do not come at the expense
of increased assessment costs." Although, under the final rule,
"trustees now must assess replacement services in addition to
lost services in most incidents," NOAA claimed that, "in general,
a net increase in assessment costs will not result, due to both
the cooperative provisions set forth within this rule and the
removal of the requirement that trustees estimate the monetary
value of damages."

According to NOAA, "the sole intent of the rule is to ensure the
restoration of natural resources and services that have been
injured, destroyed, or lost as a result of an incident." Such
restoration should occur "where there is a need to do so, and
where feasible and cost-effective means to accomplish restoration
are available," the agency said. The rule's focus on restoration
will "eliminate unneeded assessment studies and prevent
unnecessary adversarial conflicts over misunderstood goals of
trustees," according to NOAA. The agency claimed that the rule
"invites RPs to act cooperatively and responsibly to seek
expeditious and cost-effective restoration" and that it
constrains trustees' actions "to those necessary to achieve OPA's
restoration goals." As a result, according to NOAA, "costs and
damages will not be excessive or unpredictable." For further

UNDERWATER PIPELINE RUPTURE CAUSES MAJOR SPILL IN RUSSIA'S
SOUTHERN URAL MOUNTAINS.

A large but undetermined amount of crude oil spilled from an
underwater pipeline into the Belaya River near the town of Ufa in
Russia's Ural mountains on 26 December, when the line ruptured as
a result of corrosion, according to Russia's Emergencies
Ministry. Uralsibnefteprovod, the regional oil transport company
that operates the pipeline, shut down the 28-inch-diameter line
after detecting a drop in its operating pressure. The company
initially estimated that 100 metric tons of crude oil had leaked
from the ruptured pipeline, but recent reports from Russia's
ITAR-TASS news agency indicate that the spillage may have been
much higher. The spilled oil from the pipeline has flowed
downstream beneath the frozen surface of the Belaya River and,
according to some reports, has reached as far as the Tatarstan
region, which is about 100 miles from Ufa. According to a
spokesman for Russia's Emergencies Ministry, response crews have
set fire to the oil in open areas of the river to prevent it from
spreading. In addition, the crews have deployed boom to contain
the oil and have used skimming equipment to recover the oil
contained within the boomed areas. As of 7 January, the crews had
recovered 664 metric tons of an oil-water mixture from the river,
including up to 100 metric tons of crude oil. Severe cold and
adverse weather conditions have reportedly hampered the cleanup
efforts. Although the Belaya River provides drinking water for
Ufa, the Emergencies Ministry spokesman noted that the spill will
probably not impact Ufa's water supplies, because the pipeline
rupture occurred downstream from the town's water intakes on the
river. In a separate incident during 1989, a total of 765 people
were killed as a result of a massive explosion in a natural gas
liquids pipeline near Ufa (OPB, 17 July 1991, p.8). The incident
occurred when vapor leaking from the pipeline was ignited by two
trains passing through the vapor cloud.

SOLAS AMENDMENTS MANDATE ENHANCED INSPECTION PROGRAM FOR AGING
TANKERS AND BULKERS.

Aging oil tankers and bulk carriers will be subjected to more
rigorous surveys under major amendments to the International
Maritime Organization's (IMO's) 1974 International Convention for
the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS). The amendments, which took
effect on 1 January, were adopted during May 1994 by a special
diplomatic conference of the parties to SOLAS (OPB, 3 June 1994,
p.1). At the conference, delegates adopted the amendments as part
of three new chapters to SOLAS--Chapters IX, X, and XI.
Chapter XI contains the new vessel survey requirements.
Chapter X, which contains a code of safety requirements for high-
speed vessels, also took effect on 1 January. Chapter IX, which
makes mandatory IMO's International Safety Management Code, will
enter into force on 1 January 1998. "The enhanced program of
inspections was developed by IMO as a result of increasing
concern about the aging of the world merchant shipping fleet,"
according to IMO spokesman Roger Kohn. "This is particularly true
of tankers and bulk carriers, the majority of which are now
between 15 and 20 years of age," Kohn said. He noted that the
enhanced inspections "pay special attention to corrosion." During
the inspections, "coatings and tank-corrosion prevention systems
must be thoroughly checked, and measurements must be carried out
to check the thickness of plates," according to Kohn. In addition
to mandating new survey requirements, Chapter XI contains three
other regulations intended to improve ship safety. One regulation
requires that all cargo vessels of 300 GT or more and most
passenger ships obtain a valid IMO ship identification number.
Another regulation requires classification societies that perform
vessel surveys on behalf of flag-state administrations to follow
guidelines adopted during 1993 by the IMO Assembly. The third
regulation gives port-state control officers the authority to
evaluate the operators of a foreign-flag ship "when there are
clear grounds for believing that the master or crew are not
familiar with essential shipboard procedures relating to the
safety of ships." The port-state officers may detain that vessel
if their evaluation shows that the crew has inadequate knowledge
of the vessel's operations.

ENVIRONMENT CANADA REPORT EXAMINES BEHAVIOR OF OIL IN COARSE
SEDIMENTS.

Although oil penetrates to greater depths on beaches with coarse
sediments than it does on beaches with fine sediments, oil is
less likely to form lasting deposits in coarse sediments than it
is in fine sediments, according to a draft report by Environment
Canada's Emergencies Science Division. The report, entitled
Stranded Oil in Coarse Sediment Experiments, presents the
preliminary results of research sponsored by Environment Canada
to examine the relationship between sediment particle size and
the penetration and retention of oil in beach sediments.
According to the report, "in all test series, oil penetrated to
greater depths in coarser sediments." In addition, the report
noted that, for most types of oil, retention "generally decreased
in coarser sediments." However, the report also said that the
relationship between oil retention and sediment particle sizes
"differed markedly for the various crude oils tested." In the
experiments, Alaskan North Slope crude oil exhibited "one of the
most unusual sediment retention relationships, with moderate
retention in finer sediments and very low retention in coarse
sediments," the report said. It noted that the oil retention of
Alaskan North Slope crude oil in the experiments was consistent
with the behavior of that type of oil after it spilled from the
Exxon Valdez in Prince William Sound, Alaska, during 1989.
According to the report, "of all the oils tested, Alaskan North
Slope crude oil would be the most likely to freely percolate
through coarse surface sediments and to be retained in high
concentrations in the underlying fine sediments," the report
said. In fact, following the Exxon Valdez spill, "most of the
cleanup effort that occurred during 1990, 1991, and 1992 was
directed towards the cleaning of subsurface oil on coarse
sediment beaches with fine underlying sediments, even though this
coastal type represented a relatively small proportion of the
total coastline oiled," the report said. For a copy of the draft
report (EE-155), at no cost, contact: Environment Canada,

WORLD SPILL BRIEFS.

An undetermined amount of crude oil spilled from a pipeline
outside the city of Araquita in northeastern Colombia on
8 January, after rebel troops sabotaged the pipeline with
explosives, according to a spokesman for Ecopetrol, the state-
owned company that operates the line. Although Ecopetrol shut
down the pipeline after the attack, the company has been unable
to begin repairing the damaged segment due to continuing
skirmishes between Colombian government soldiers and rebel forces
from the National Liberation Army. According to the Ecopetrol
spokesman, the National Liberation Army, which has carried out
numerous acts of sabotage in recent years against the company's
oil pipelines, claimed responsibility for the recent pipeline
attack.

A 32-inch-diameter pipeline ruptured due to corrosion and spilled
an undetermined amount of crude oil on 24 December about 60 miles
west of Ukhta in the Russia's northern Komi Republic, according
to Russia's ITAR-TASS news agency. Crews from Transneft, the
state-owned company that operates the pipeline, have reportedly
replaced a 165-foot-long section of the damaged line. Although
news reports initially indicated that the spilled oil from the
pipeline had contaminated the Ropcha River, Transneft officials
have since said that the oil did not enter the river. Transneft
has also estimated that it will take at least three weeks to
clean up the spill. One of the largest pipeline spills in world
history occurred during the fall of 1994 near Usinsk in the Komi
Republic, about 200 miles northeast of the recent pipeline
rupture (OPB, 4 Nov. 1994, p.1). In April 1995, a natural gas
pipeline exploded in a wooded area about 8 miles outside of
Ukhta, sending flames hundreds of feet into the air and burning
several acres of forest (OPB, 5 May 1995, p.6).

The 97,689-DWT Bahamian tanker Alandia Wave spilled an estimated
500 to 1,000 gallons of crude oil on 21 December while loading
oil at the British Petroleum terminal on the Sullom Voe in
Shetland, U.K., according to a spokesman for the Shetland Islands
Council. The oil apparently leaked from a crack in the tanker's
No. 1 port cargo tank, but surveyors have not yet determined what
caused the crack. After determining the source of the spill, the
Alandia Wave's crew was able to minimize the spillage by
transferring oil from the No. 1 tank to other tanks aboard the
vessel. Although response crews from the Shetland Islands Council
and British Petroleum deployed boom to contain the spill, a small
amount of the spilled oil came ashore on a beach at Sella Ness.

The government of Singapore recently ordered Singapore Refining
Co. to pay a fine of $150,000 Singapore ($1.00 Singapore =
$0.70 U.S.) in connection with an oil spill that occurred on
25 August 1995 from a pipeline at the company's refinery in Palau
Merlimau, off Singapore's southwestern coast, according to news
reports (OPB, 8 Sept. 1995, p.7). About 300 metric tons of heavy
fuel oil leaked from the pipeline through a valve that was
accidentally left open during an oil transfer operation. The
spilled oil formed a 60-square-kilometer slick and came ashore at
beaches on the tourist resort island of Sentosa, about
12 kilometers east of the refinery. An estimated $1.7 million
Singapore was spent to clean up the spill.

OIL POLLUTION BULLETIN HOTLINE.

NRC and Edison Chouest Offshore Inc. of Galliano, Louisiana, have
reached an agreement in principle to integrate Chouest's staff
and fleet of offshore vessels into NRC's network of oil spill
response resources. According to NRC, Chouest currently employs a
staff of about 600 people and operates a fleet of 57 vessels in
the Gulf of Mexico, as well as on the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific
coasts. With the addition of the Chouest fleet, NRC's Marine
Resource Network now consists of more than 800 crew boats, supply
vessels, utility vessels, barges, and tugboats throughout the
United States. "We are pleased to be working with Chouest, which
is represented by a highly professional group of employees,"
commented NRC President Mark Miller. "NRC believes that the key
to rapid response to an oil spill is access to people,
specialized equipment, and marine resources," Miller said. For
further information, contact: Mark Miller, NRC, 460 Edwards
Avenue, P.O. Box 609, Calverton, NY 11933; Tel: 516-369-8644;

In the first application of its "direct final rule" process, USCG
recently issued a final rule to remove the text of the
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea
(COLREGS) from the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).
According to USCG, the COLREGS text, which is found in 33 CFR
Part 81, duplicates text also found in the United States Code and
is therefore unnecessary. Under the direct final rule process,
USCG may issue a final rule without first publishing it as a
proposed rule, provided that the agency does not expect to
receive any adverse comments on the final rule. If USCG receives
no adverse comments on the final rule within a specified time
period, the rule takes effect. If adverse comments are received
during that period, USCG must publish a notice in the Federal
Register retracting or modifying the rule. The recent final rule
removing the COLREGS text from the CFR will take effect on
1 April, unless adverse comments are received. For further
information, see pages 8 and 9 of Vol. 61, No. 1 of the Federal
Register, or contact: Diane Schneider Appleby, USCG Headquarters,
2100 Second Street, S.W., Washington, DC 20593-0001; Tel: 202-
267-0352.

The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT's) Research and
Special Programs Administration (RSPA) plans to hold a public
workshop on 18 January in Washington, D.C., to solicit comments
on the agency's recently proposed criteria for identifying
"unusually sensitive" environmental areas in close proximity to
gas and hazardous liquid pipelines (OPB, 16 June 1995, p.8).
According to RSPA, many federal, state, and local regulations,
including RSPA's current rules on pipelines that carry oil and
other hazardous liquids, refer to "environmentally sensitive"
areas without clearly defining what constitutes such areas.
Persons who are unable to attend the workshop may submit written
comments; these comments are due by 5 February. For further
information, see pages 342 to 344 of Vol. 61, No. 3 of the
Federal Register, or contact: Christina Sames, RSPA, DOT,
400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, DC 20590-0001; Tel: 202-
366-4561.

On 28 December, USCG issued a supplemental notice of proposed
rulemaking (SNPRM) on structural measures designed to reduce the
amount of oil spilled from non-double-hull tankers until their
mandatory retirement from service in U.S. waters under USCG's
double-hull regulations (OPB, 29 Dec. 1995, p.5). Although OPB
had expected to provide full coverage of the SNPRM in this issue,
the release of USCG's final guidelines on the OSRO classification
process and NOAA's final NRDA rule has delayed OPB's coverage of
the SNPRM until next issue.

SUPERFUND STAFF JOINS OTHER EPA WORKERS ON FURLOUGH

As the second federal government shutdown of FY 1996 entered its
third week, EPA Administrator Carol Browner announced on 2 January
that the Superfund monies for FY 1995 have been depleted, and that
about 2,400 EPA employees working under the Superfund program
nationwide will join 14,500 EPA workers who are already on
furlough. According to EPA, the furlough of the 2,400 Superfund
workers will result in the shutdown of operations at 450 to
650 hazardous waste sites nationwide--National Priorities List
(NPL) sites and non-NPL sites--and will leave a total of about
80 EPA employees to oversee any remaining operations. According to
EPA's initial estimates, the shutdown of operations at Superfund
sites also threatens the jobs of 10,000 private-sector workers, who
could be laid off because the government is not able to make timely
payments to their employers. The 10,000 private-sector workers
consist of 5,000 employees of cleanup companies working directly
under contract with EPA and another 5,000 employees working on
cleanups that, while led by potentially responsible parties (PRPs),
still require EPA oversight.

"If the program is dormant for long, private companies will be
forced to make permanent staff changes, which will seriously
undermine our work in restoring the environment," according to
Jonathan Curtis, president and chief executive officer of CDM
Federal Programs Corp. in Fairfax, Virginia. By the end of the week
of 1 January, "private companies will begin making these staffing
assessments if the shutdown is not concluded," said Curtis, who is
chairman of the Hazardous Waste Action Coalition's (HWAC's)
Government Affairs Committee. "Just as Superfund is beginning to
produce results, the plug is pulled," he added. William Epstein,
director of government affairs at Roy F. Weston, Inc. in West
Chester, Pennsylvania, lamented that the current government
shutdown will actually increase the overall costs of the Superfund
program. "We have been told by EPA officials that the mobilization
and demobilization by federal contractors will cost more than if we
continued work," Epstein noted. "This shutdown will achieve no
savings." According to an EPA source, implementing the shutdown of
the Superfund program--an operation that began on 2 January--is
expected to take at least five days.

In connection with the government shutdown, HWAC's legal counsel,
the law firm Morgan Lewis & Bockius in Washington, D.C., has issued
a white paper alerting cleanup contractors of the legal issues and
risks that they face, and their options for response, "in the event
of a lapse in the annual appropriations that fund their federal
agency customers." Contractors that do not receive payment for
their services "have the right to suspend their performance," the
white paper said, and depending on the clauses in their contracts
with EPA and other federal agencies, "they may or may not be
entitled to an equitable adjustment for the suspension period if
and when more funds are allotted to their contracts." Other
contractors that do not lose funding altogether but otherwise face
delays and disruptions because of the shutdown may not be entitled
to compensation "because the lapse in appropriations could be
deemed a sovereign, as opposed to a contractual, act of the
government," the white paper said. For a copy of the white paper,
contact: HWAC, No. 802, 1015 15th Street, N.W., Washington,
DC 20005; Tel: 202-347-7474.

The troubles of federal contractors will not end even if another
continuing resolution is approved soon. During FY 1996, which began
on 1 October 1995, two continuing resolutions have been required to
maintain operations at those federal agencies and departments,
including EPA and the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State,
whose FY 1996 appropriations have not yet been approved. Those
continuing resolutions have funded operations at levels below
FY 1995 appropriations, thereby preventing agency and department
managers--many of whom are expecting dramatic cuts when their
FY 1996 appropriations are finally approved--from making reliable
spending plans for the current fiscal year. According to an HMIR
source, developing final FY 1996 budgets for as-yet-unfunded
agencies and departments could take up to two more months--
approaching the halfway point in the current fiscal year--leaving
only six or seven months for the agencies to spend their monies.
"Getting everything going again in an efficient way will be very
difficult" under those circumstances, the source told HMIR. "It's
not a good way to run a government."

The impact of the federal government shutdown on the environmental
industry is not limited to suspended EPA contracts. Key departments
involved in the promotion of environmental exports--including the
Department of Commerce (DOC), the Department of State, and the
Agency for International Development (AID)--remain unfunded, and
export-promotion projects involving those entities and private-
sector organizations are imperiled. The Environmental Export
Council (EEC) in Washington, D.C., currently has cooperative
agreements with AID and DOC to develop environmental export
programs, but without the federal funding for the programs, "we're
going to have to quit working on these projects reasonably soon,"
said John Mizroch, EEC's executive director. In addition, EEC may
have to lay off people who are working on a project with the U.S.-
Asia Environmental Partnership (USAEP) that would have involved
bringing officials of Asian nations to the United States to review
U.S. environmental technologies and products. "The government
shutdown comes at a very unfortunate time," Mizroch told HMIR,
"because it holds up these important initiatives that will help
U.S. business."

Congressional Republicans have linked the approval of any new
continuing resolution with the White House's concession on key
elements of a balanced-budget plan--notably on Congress's proposed
Medicare cuts and tax relief. On 2 January, however, Senate
Majority Leader Robert Dole (Republican-Kansas) expressed his
frustration with the impasse and, departing from other Republican
leaders, engineered passage of a continuing resolution in the
Senate. On 3 January, the House rejected the measure. At press
time, however, the House had softened its stance slightly and
indicated that it was prepared to approve a plan to put about
280,000 federal employees in several programs back to work, until
26 January in some cases and until 15 March in others. The affected
programs include Meals on Wheels, the administration of
unemployment insurance, visitor services at national parks, and Aid
to Families with Dependent Children. The House plan would not
provide money to run those federal agencies and departments whose
FY 1996 appropriations have not yet been approved, including EPA,
DOC, the Department of Interior, and the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

OCCIDENTAL AGREES TO PAY $129 MILLION FOR LOVE CANAL CLEANUP

The story of the hazardous waste site that was largely responsible
for giving birth to the federal Superfund program neared conclusion
last month as the federal government and Occidental Chemical Corp.
reached an agreement resolving Occidental's cleanup liabilities at
the Love Canal site near Niagara Falls, New York. Under the terms
of a settlement that was filed on 21 December in the U.S. District
Court in Buffalo, New York, Occidental will pay the federal
government a total of $129 million, consisting of $101 million that
the government has spent on cleanup and $28 million in interest
accrued during 16 years of litigation. The settlement "should send
a message of federal persistence and tenacity," said Attorney
General Janet Reno in announcing the settlement. EPA Administrator
Carol Browner noted that "the Love Canal settlement underscores
this Administration's firm commitment to ensuring that polluters--
not the American people--pick up the tab for cleaning up toxic
waste dumps."

The settlement must still be approved by U.S. District Court Judge
John Curtin, who has presided over the 16-year-old case since the
federal government filed its initial lawsuit against Occidental in
December 1979. The lawsuit sought cleanup and related damages,
including punitive damages, under the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act (RCRA), the River and Harbors Act, and other
environmental laws. The state of New York subsequently filed its
own lawsuit against Occidental. Both complaints were later joined
and amended to include cost-recovery claims under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA),
which was enacted in December 1980 under the shadow of the Love
Canal incident and the increasingly controversial problem of
abandoned toxic waste sites. In a settlement approved by Judge
Curtin in July 1994, Occidental agreed to pay New York a total of
nearly $100 million and to perform long-term operation and
maintenance of the remediation systems at the Love Canal site.

Occidental Chemical became involved in the Love Canal saga as a
result of its acquisition of Hooker Chemical and Plastics Corp. In
the early 1940s, Hooker leased and then acquired an uncompleted
canal in the Niagara Falls area--the so-called Love Canal. Until
1953, the company dumped about 25,000 tons of chemical waste into
the canal and nearby pits. Hooker subsequently buried the wastes
and sold the property to the Niagara Falls School Board for $1,
with the stipulation that the board would not hold Hooker legally
responsible for any subsequent problems that the buried wastes
might cause. From the 1960s through the mid-1970s, complaints by
local residents about foul odors in the area evolved into
complaints about chemicals leaking into the basements of nearby
homes and surfacing in yards, and ultimately into complaints about
health problems. Responding to the complaints, the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) undertook the relocation of
239 families in the Love Canal area in 1978; President Jimmy Carter
ordered the evacuation of another 800 Love Canal families in
December 1980. FEMA--and later EPA--also took response actions at
the site, consisting of constructing a clay cap over the canal to
prevent air emissions and installing a leachate collection system
to prevent the migration of chemical wastes from the canal.

A local school and several homes were subsequently demolished, and
contaminated sewer systems and nearby creek sediments were removed
or cleaned up; the leachate collection system is still operating.
In June 1990, the Love Canal Revitalization Agency adopted a plan
for resettling homes in the area, and the first homes went up for
sale later that year. In 1992, the Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) agreed to provide mortgage insurance for the Love
Canal properties, thereby increasing the pace of home sales in the
area. To date, all but 32 of the 233 homes that were available have
been sold or are under contract for sale, according to the
Department of Justice (DOJ).

Under the settlement between Occidental and the federal government,
the company will pay EPA a total of $102 million covering the
agency's response costs plus interest, while the rest of the
$129 million will go to FEMA for its role in the response action.
The settlement also resolves Occidental's claims that, in addition
to Hooker, the U.S. Army dumped chemical wastes into Love Canal and
therefore should be held partially responsible for the cleanup
costs. Without admitting any guilt on behalf of the Army, the
federal government agreed to assume $8 million of the Love Canal
response costs.

In announcing the settlement, federal officials took specific aim
at Congressional proposals to provide liability relief to
potentially responsible parties (PRPs) through reimbursements or
tax credits amounting to as much as 50 percent of PRP costs
associated with the cleanup of wastes disposed of before 1980
(Senate proposal) or 1987 (House proposal). According to Lois
Schiffer, assistant attorney general for DOJ's Environment and
Natural Resources Division, such proposals could give Occidental a
tax credit for as much as $64.5 million in connection with the
company's Love Canal liabilities under CERCLA. A reimbursement
system of the type proposed by Congress "would destroy the
fundamental principle that a polluter should pay to clean up its
own mess," Schiffer noted. EPA's Browner declared that "elimination
of the retroactive liability provisions in the Superfund law--as
some have proposed--would have let this polluter off the hook."

Lois Gibbs, executive director of the Citizens Clearinghouse for
Hazardous Waste in Falls Church, Virginia, said that she was happy
with the settlement. "It has got to send a chill up the spine of
many others who pollute and pretend it is not a problem," said
Gibbs, the former Love Canal housewife whose organizing efforts
helped draw national attention to the area's contamination. A
strong proponent of the polluter-pays principal, Gibbs sharply
criticized Congressional attempts to reimburse PRPs for portions of
their cleanup liabilities. "The only way Occidental and others will
change their way of behaving will be if it costs them more to
pollute--to do harm than to do good," she told HMIR. "Instead of
cutting the costs for those who have not complied with the
Superfund law, Congress should reward those who did comply, and
those who have improved their environmental practices," she
suggested.

Beyond addressing the polluter-pays issue, the Love Canal case does
not provide much direction for efforts to reform the Superfund
program, according to Occidental attorney Steven Yablonsky, a
partner at Piper & Marbury in Baltimore, Maryland. Love Canal "is
not one of those sites that had hundreds of responsible parties,"
said Yablonsky, who noted that multi-PRP sites have presented the
most vexing liability problems under CERCLA. Yablonsky added that
a key development in the case was Judge Curtin's ruling in March
1994 that Hooker's waste disposal practices were consistent with
industry's practices at the time, and that Occidental therefore
should not be held liable for punitive damages in the Love Canal
case. "There couldn't have been a settlement without that ruling,"
Yablonsky told HMIR.

While Occidental has now settled the major CERCLA claims of the
federal government and the state of New York, the company is still
negotiating with the city of Niagara Falls and the Niagara Falls
School Board to determine the cleanup liabilities of those two
municipal entities. In addition, Occidental is still engaged in
personal-injury litigation with numerous Niagara County residents,
and it is seeking coverage of its cleanup liabilities at Love Canal
from its insurers.

PUBLIC CITIZEN ACCUSES NAFTA OF FAILING TO IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENT
ALONG THE U.S.-MEXICO BORDER.

Far from fulfilling proponents' assurances that the North American
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) would result in an improved
environment along the U.S.-Mexico border, trade between the U.S.
and Mexico under NAFTA has exacerbated border-area problems through
an increase in industrial activity, according to a recent report by
Public Citizen in Washington, D.C. The report concluded that
NAFTA's advocates--notably the Clinton Administration--inaccurately
predicted that NAFTA would lead to increased investment throughout
Mexico and, as a result, less concentration of "maquiladora"
facilities along the U.S.-Mexico border. Maquiladoras are Mexico-
based manufacturing facilities that are owned by foreign firms. The
Public Citizen report found that, largely as a result of the
devaluation of the Mexican peso one year ago, nationwide investment
in Mexico's infrastructure and industrial base has failed to
materialize. At the same time, the number of maquiladora facilities
in the border area has increased by 20 percent from more than
546,000 to nearly 690,000 facilities since NAFTA took effect in
January 1994, despite an economic crisis that has resulted in a net
loss of 1.6 million jobs throughout Mexico. The report noted that
the increased maquiladora activity along the U.S. Mexico border,
coupled with a lack of investment in pollution-control
infrastructure and the Mexican government's lack of support for
environmental enforcement, has resulted in increased illegal
dumping of hazardous wastes, increased air and water pollution, and
worsening health problems, including increased incidences of
hepatitis, cholera, and certain birth defects. According to the
report, the Commission on Environmental Cooperation--the panel
established under NAFTA to rule on any complaints that the NAFTA
nations are not meeting their environmental obligations--has not
yet heard a single case involving Mexico's failure to enforce its
environmental laws in the border area. "NAFTA begins its third year
sinking in a sea of broken promises relating to the environment,
public health, jobs, and wages," said Public Citizen President Joan
Claybrook in announcing the report on 2 January. "Not only is NAFTA
not meeting these promises, it has actually made conditions worse
than before it took effect two years ago," she said. For a copy of
the 110-page Public Citizen report, entitled NAFTA's Broken
Promises: The Border Betrayed, at a cost of $15, contact: Customer

M4 ENVIRONMENTAL STARTS OPERATIONS AT FIRST COMMERCIAL-SCALE
QUANTUM-CEP FACILITY.

M4 Environmental L.P., a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and
Molten Metal Technology, Inc. (MMT) in Waltham, Massachusetts, has
begun operations at the first commercial-scale facility to use
MMT's Catalytic Extraction Process (CEP) for recycling hazardous
wastes. The M4 facility, which is located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee,
will use a variant of the CEP technology, known as Quantum-CEP,
that is designed to handle radioactive and mixed wastes. The
Quantum-CEP process uses a molten metal bath to break down
radioactive and mixed wastes into their constituents, recovers
various useful materials, such as metals and gases, and stabilizes
the radioactive materials for final disposal. Subsequent to the
start-up of operations at the M4 facility, MMT announced that it
has expanded its original technology license to M4 by allowing the
joint venture to process mixed wastes from commercial generators.
Previously, M4 held a license to process only mixed wastes
generated by the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of
Defense (DOD), and U.S. Enrichment Corp. In a separate
announcement, MMT said that another commercial-scale Quantum-CEP
facility in Oak Ridge--this one jointly operated by MMT and
Westinghouse subsidiary Scientific Ecology Group, Inc. (SEG)--has
received all of its required regulatory permits and is ready to
begin operations. The MMT-SEG facility is expected to process its
first wastes this month and will handle up to 130,000 cubic feet of
low-level ion exchange resins per year. "I am happy to announce
that this facility is available on schedule, and we expect
tremendous success with volume reduction and recycling of this
difficult waste," said SEG President Bud Arrowsmith in a statement
on 19 December. William Haney III, MMT's president and chief
executive officer, noted that the MMT-SEG facility "is the largest
and most sophisticated system in the world for handling this
difficult radioactive material."

MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS, AND OFFERINGS.

Allstate GeoTek, a privately held environmental services firm based
in Linden, New Jersey, has acquired Zecco, Inc. from Metcalf & Eddy
Technologies, Inc. in Wakefield, Massachusetts, for an undisclosed
amount of cash. Privately held Allstate GeoTek is a $22-million
company that provides a variety of environmental services,
including remediation and sewer inspection and cleaning, in
Delaware, New Jersey, and southeastern Pennsylvania. Zecco, which
is operating at a run rate of about $6.5 million, provides
remediation and emergency response services and operates a
hazardous waste storage and transfer facility in Northborough,
Massachusetts.

Babcock & Wilcox Power Generation Group, a subsidiary of McDermott
International, Inc. in New Orleans, Louisiana, has acquired the
assets of Joy Environmental Technologies, Inc. from Harnischefeger
Industries, Inc. in Brookfield, Wisconsin. The terms of the
transaction were not disclosed. Houston-based Joy Environmental
manufactures air-pollution-control equipment--such as baghouses,
ash-handling systems, electrostatic precipitators, and flue-gas
desulfurization systems--for electric utilities and industrial
companies. According to Babcock & Wilcox, Joy Environmental's line
of ash-handling systems will be transferred to Diamond Power
Specialty Co., a Babcock & Wilcox unit that specializes in
manufacturing boiler cleaning and diagnostic equipment.

Barringer Laboratories, Inc. in Golden, Colorado, announced that it
has purchased 647,238 shares of its common stock from its sister
corporation Barringer Technologies, Inc. According to Barringer
Laboratories, the stock was acquired in exchange for $509,048 in
"intercompany obligations" and another $300,000 in cash. In
addition, 88,260 shares of Barringer Laboratories' common stock
were placed in an escrow account and will be returned to Barringer
Technologies if Barringer Laboratories achieves certain earnings
goals for 1996. "This transaction is the first step in a long-term
plan to grow and increase the stockholders' value in the
laboratory," said Robert Walker, chairman and chief executive
officer of Barringer Laboratories. As a result of the transaction,
"each current shareholder realizes an increase of 39.1 percent in
their stock ownership of the company," Walker noted.

Black & Veatch in Kansas City, Missouri, announced that it has
increased its revolving credit facility with a consortium of
international banks from $150 million to $175 million. According to
P.J. Adam, Black & Veatch's chairman and chief executive officer,
the expanding credit facility will allow the company to borrow
short-term funds and issue longer-term letters of credit to finance
its worldwide engineering and construction projects. "Our continued
success in obtaining international work depends on having the
necessary credit support," Adam noted. Black & Veatch's
international projects accounted for more than 50 percent of the
company's estimated $1.1 billion in revenues during 1995.

Brownfield Development Corp. (BDC) in Chicago, Illinois, and
LandBank in Denver, Colorado, have established a strategic alliance
to provide services related to the cleanup and redevelopment of so-
called "brownfields" sites--abandoned industrial properties that
face difficulties in redevelopment because of actual or perceived
contamination at the sites. Under the alliance, the two companies
will jointly identify and assess brownfields properties and make
the financing, insurance, and legal arrangements to remediate those
sites and return them to economic usefulness. BDC currently
provides those types of services in the Midwest, while LandBank
provides similar services from its offices in New York City,
Denver, and San Francisco. In addition to increasing BDC's
geographic coverage, the alliance with LandBank will "expand our
development capabilities, increase our capital reserves, and focus
on the acquisition of larger sites," according to BDC Manager
Robert Colangelo. LandBank President Bill Lynott noted that "we are
very excited about the opportunity to apply our environmental
underwriting and proprietary insurance products to BDC's focused
program in the metropolitan Chicago area," where the brownfields
redevelopment market is especially active.

Envirometrics, Inc. in Charleston, South Carolina, and Zellweger
Analytics, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Zellweger Luwa
Organization of Switzerland, have reached an agreement whereby
Zellweger Analytics will have the exclusive worldwide rights to
market Envirometrics' ACT Monitoring Card System. The ACT system
uses an electronic reader and "passive monitoring cards" to detect
the presence of hazardous chemicals in industrial environments and
to conduct analyses of air samples in real time. Zellweger
Analytics "is an international leader in safety, health, and
environmental products, and we look forward to new technology-
partnership developments and synergistic opportunities for the two
companies," said Richard Bennett, Envirometrics' president and
chief executive officer.

Environmental Technologies Corp., a provider of refrigerant
recovery and recycling services and equipment in Lakewood, New
Jersey, has acquired all of the outstanding stock of FulCircle
Recyclers, Inc. in New York, New York, a recycler of ballasts from
fluorescent lights, in exchange for 1.15-million shares of newly
issued Environmental Technologies common stock. As part of the
transaction, Brin McCagg and Mitchell Dong, two of FulCircle's
principals, have been appointed as chief executive officer and
president, respectively, of Environmental Technologies. The two men
take over those positions from George Cannan, who will remain
chairman of the company. FulCircle expects to report revenues
totaling $6 million during 1995, while Environmental Technologies
had revenues of $28.6 million during the fiscal year ending on
30 September 1995.

EnviroSource, Inc. in Stamford, Connecticut, has entered into a
new, $100-million credit agreement with NationsBank and Credit
Lyonnaise. According to EnviroSource, the new, five-year agreement
replaces an existing $60-million agreement with the two banks and
provides EnviroSource with the financing to redeem all of its
Class G, $7.25 Cumulative Preferred Stock. The Class G stock is due
15 July 1996. As a result of the new credit agreement,
"EnviroSource will have minimal debt maturities over the next six
years, which will allow us to reinvest our cash flows from
operations into the business," according to George Fuehrer,
EnviroSource's senior vice president of planning. The company plans
to focus that reinvestment on internal growth rather than on growth
through mergers and acquisitions, "although we are not ruling that
avenue out," Fuehrer told HMIR.

Heidemij NV in Arnhem, the Netherland, and Eptisa, a consulting and
engineering firm in Madrid, Spain, have agreed to merge in a
transaction under which Heidemij and Eptisa's management will each
acquire 50 percent of Eptisa's stock from the company's single
shareholder, Banco Central Hispano. As part of the transaction,
Eptisa will sell its non-core activities in the engineering and
maintenance of power stations. Eptisa, which specializes in water,
environmental, and infrastructure engineering, derived revenues
totaling $80 million from these core businesses during 1994. "We
have been working with Eptisa since 1992 in a joint venture,
Ecogest, aimed at providing environmental services to industry,"
said Heidemij chairman Frans Luttmer. "This successful venture is
now the starting point for a much larger cooperation between the
two companies." In a separate action, Heidemij's subsidiary
Geraghty & Miller has acquired Environmental Strategies Ltd., an
environmental consulting and engineering firm with offices in Leeds
and Chester, England, and has merged Environmental Standards with
G&M International, Inc. in Cambridge. According to G&M
International Manager Brian Cook, "by merging with Environmental
Strategies' staff, we will be able to expand our auditing and due-
diligence work and have a strong presence in the Northwest region
of the United Kingdom."

Philip Environmental, Inc. in Hamilton, Ontario, and Zenon
Environmental, Inc. in Burlington, Ontario, have reached an
agreement whereby Philip Environmental will acquire Zenon's
laboratory business. The terms of the transaction were not
disclosed. Zenon's laboratory operations generated an estimated
$12 million in revenues during 1995 and consist of facilities in
Burlington and in Montreal, Quebec, and Vancouver, British
Columbia. According to Philip Environmental, the addition of the
three Zenon laboratories to Philip's existing laboratory operation
in Mississauga, Ontario, will give Philip the largest network of
environmental laboratories in Canada. The acquisition of the Zenon
laboratory facilities is expected to be completed by 15 January.
Philip Environmental is currently engaged in an aggressive
acquisition campaign and recently acquired CyanoKEM and ThermalKEM
from REP Environmental Processes, which is the former American
NuKEM (HMIR, 8 Dec. 1995, p.2).

UTILX Corp., a drilling firm based in Kent, Washington, has
announced that FlowMole Environmental Services Corp., a joint
venture between UTILX and Unocal subsidiary CERT Environmental
Corp., has begun to "wind down" its remediation operations.
According to UTILX President Craig Davies, the decision to cease
the operations of FlowMole is based on Unocal's decision to
terminate all joint-venture relationships connected to
environmental work and exit the environmental business. FlowMole
was established in 1994 to market innovative remediation approaches
using CERT Environmental's remediation technologies and UTILX's
horizontal guided drilling technology.

HMIR HOTLINE.

Fernald Environmental Restoration Management Co. (FERMCO), DOE's
Environmental Restoration Management Contractor at the former Feed
Materials Production Center near Fernald, Ohio, is requesting firms
to submit expressions of interest in supplying a vitrification
furnace to process radioactive wastes that are currently stored at
the Fernald facility. According to FERMCO, the furnace must be
capable of producing 20 to 30 tons of vitrified waste per day.
While FERMCO does not expect to issue the request for proposals
(RFP) for the vitrification project until April, it is requesting
that parties indicate by 15 January their interest in supplying the
vitrification furnace. For further information, contact: Bob May,
FERMCO, Mail Stop 52-4, P.O. Box 538704, Cincinnati, OH 45253-8704;
Tel: 513-648-4322; Fax: 513-648-4900.

VECTRA Technologies, Inc., a San Ramon, California-based provider
of radioactive waste management and other engineering services to
the energy industry, announced on 28 December that it is
temporarily suspending all construction and start-up activities
related to its EnviroGlass vitrification program. According to Ray
Fortney, VECTRA's president and chief executive officer, the
interruption in the company's progress towards developing the
EnviroGlass technology "was necessary because delays in placing our
Transportable Vitrification Unit at our lead client's site made it
impossible to meet the client's schedule to dispose of the low-
level waste that we are contracted to process." Fortney noted that
VECTRA is negotiating with the client to remove the low-level
wastes and dispose of them through a subcontractor, "but if we are
not successful in these negotiations, we may be forced to accept
contract cancellation." Fortney said that the company will continue
to pursue new projects involving the EnviroGlass technology.

CompuChem Environmental Corp. in Research Triangle Park, North
Carolina, has announced that it is seeking to acquire an analytical
laboratory to merge into its facility at Research Triangle Park
(RTP). CompuChem said that it plans to transfer the laboratory
equipment and technical personnel of the acquired laboratory to its
RTP facility while maintaining any existing sales offices that the
acquired company may operate. "Our philosophy is to keep it all
under one roof, so you can have all your certifications,
sophisticated equipment, and experienced staff in one place, and
thereby better serve your customers," according to CompuChem
President Kees Verkerk. He said that the primary purpose of the
acquisition is to expand the company's business, which is currently
concentrated in the federal sector, into the industrial market.
According to Verkerk, the 55,000-square-foot RTP facility is one of
the largest laboratories in the United States, employing up to
200 people during its peak seasons. For further information,
contact: CompuChem Environmental Corp., 3306 Chapel Hill/Nelson
Highway, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709; Tel: 919-406-1601.

UNION SEEKS COURT-ORDERED BAN OF MEXICAN TRUCKS

The Teamsters Union is seeking a court order banning Mexican trucks from
entering the U.S. unless drivers show evidence that DOT safety rules are met.
A ruling favoring the union would require Mexican truckers to show custom
officials proof of insurance and other documents demonstrating compliance
with hazardous materials and rules.

Under North American Free Trade Agreement provisions effective in Decem-ber,
Mexican trucks gained access to U.S. roads in Arizona, California, New Mexico
and Texas.  While the treaty requires them to comply with DOT rules when in
the U.S., the Teamsters allege drivers are being waved through after signing
compliance check-off forms rather than undergoing safety inspections.  On
Dec. 15, the union asked the D.C. circuit appeals court for an emergency stay
halting Mexican cross-border trucking.

The Teamsters allege DOT knows Mexican truckers often fail to maintain
adequate insurance, are not licensed or properly qualified, operate unsafe
vehicles and fail to assure safety when carrying dangerous materials.  It
noted a one-day inspection in October by the Texas Railroad Commission found
evidence of fraudulent insurance coverage by trucks entering the state.  The
union asked that trucks be barred until DOT sets up a centralized enforcement
system.  A court ruling is expected by February.

CDL ENFORCEMENT GETS BOOST VIA HIGHWAY BILL

State transportation agencies will receive $5.4 billion in federal funds
during 1996 with significant increases in aid to administer the national
commercial driver's license (CDL) program.  The money, authorized by National
Highway System (NHS) legislation enacted in December, includes a nearly 15%
boost in federal funds to enforce CDL rules for trucks carrying hazardous
materials.  The measure also calls for additional increases of up to 10% in
1997 and 1998 to assist states in CDL compliance.

To qualify, states must show DOT they will use funding to meet CDL
inspections and enforcement program standards.  Aid will go only to states
that maintain record-keeping systems and participate in a national DOT data
base program to track records on drivers, truck and equipment inspections and
traffic accidents involving commercial vehicles.  An intended benefit of the
plan is to help DOT gather data on number of licensed hazardous materials
drivers and quantities of hazardous materials transported.

Some 1.1 million roadside inspections now are done annually and higher
allocations will allow those to increase, DOT said.  The program also
includes funding for drug and alcohol enforcement.  DOT noted that in 1992,
federal aid helped several states set up drug-free zones within 1,000 feet of
truck stops, doubling penalties for selling of drugs there.

In addition to hailing increased CDL funding, DOT Secretary Federico Pena
called the National Highway System the "backbone of America's transportation
network."  The 165,000-mile road system includes the current Interstate
system as well as other major state and federal highways.  Although it
comprises only 4% of the nation's roads, NHS carries about 40% of all traffic
and some 75% of truck traffic.  NHS roads also represent over 90% of the
approved hazardous materials routing network.

RAILROAD INCIDENT REPORTING CHANGES DELAYED

The new incident reporting rules have been delayed at least until April to
let the Federal Railroad Administration consider questions from railroads on
company-managed control programs.  FRA is considering industry proposals to
omit a provision that railroads maintain in-house controls to ensure that
reports are filed for each incident.

Arguing that in-house programs would be burdensome, railroads urged FRA to
adopt a "99% performance standard."  By dividing the number of reported
accidents by the number of actual accidents, companies say they could compare
reporting rates against a 99% standard to determine whether reporting
performance is satisfactory.

While agreeing that a 99% performance rate would be acceptable, FRA said that
before adopting such an approach it would consider adding penalties for
companies falling short of the standard.  It asked for industry input on a
plan where fines increased for each percentage point below 99%.  The agency
suggested $1,000 for 98%; $3,000 for 97%; $9,000 for 96%, and so on.

FRA noted that changes in accident reporting standards would not alter
corrective action reporting required when non-compliance citations involve
assessment of civil penalties.  Such reporting is limited to physical defects
in rail equipment, such as cracks in hazardous material cargo tanks;
insufficient record keeping, such as tracking engineer time-on-duty; and
failure to file safety violation reports.

PRIOR NOTICE TIME CUT FOR DOCK-SIDE GAS TRANSFERS

Liquefied gas transfer operators at shipping ports have been granted relief
from section 127.131(a) "prior notification" rules.  Despite overall Coast
Guard tightening of gas unloading standards, beginning Jan. 1 liquefied gas
facilities may give port authorities only four hours notice before cargo
transfers.

Facility operators had argued against the 24-hour notice saying frequent
changes in weather or tides made arrival schedules uncertain.  The Coast
Guard agreed after company logs showed facilities often cannot know 24 hours
in advance when ships will arrive.

Though willing to relax notification time, the Coast Guard said other rules
tightening liquefied hazardous gas transfers would go forward in 1996.  These
include more rigid procedures for monitoring unloading operations and
requirements that automatic transfer shutdown equipment be installed.  Data
collected since 1985 on deaths and property damage resulting from accidents
during liquefied gas transfers indicate current rules are "unjustifiably
lax," the Coast Guard said.

TRUCK SIZE DEBATE ADDS TO NAFTA IMPLEMENTATION WOES

U.S. and Mexican transportation officials will meet in January to try to iron
out differences regarding size of trucks allowed into Mexico under the North
American Free Trade Agreement.  While U.S. truckers are protesting entrance
of Mexican trucks into border states [see story p. 1], Mexico is attempting
to ban on its roads 53-foot-long trailers, the dominant size used by U.S.
companies.

Three days before the Dec. 18 border opening, Mexican custom officials said
the trailers would not be let into the country for equipment "safety rea-
sons" related to truck length and hazardous cargoes that could be hauled.

After strong protests from U.S. transportation and trade representatives,
Mexico agreed to permit the trailers as long as the entire vehicle did not
exceed 68 feet.  Carriers claim this would effectively halt U.S. trailer
entry into Mexico because few 53-foot trailer rigs are less than 68 feet
long.

The issue appears to have stemmed from internal conflicts between Mexican
transportation officials and border-area custom houses, private businesses
that enforce rules at crossings.  According to Dave Berry, VP at Swift
Transportation of Phoenix, the Mexican transportation agency would like
differences resolved so transborder shipments can proceed, but customhouses
are being responsive to Mexican domestic trucking problems.

U.S. Trade representative Mickey Cantor expressed hope that the January talks
would resolve the problem.  In the interim, certain trailers may cross only
if interline arrangements are made so that U.S. trailers are towed into
Mexico by Mexican drivers.

PORTABLE TANKS BANNED FOR PEROXIDE SHIPMENTS

Shippers have until Oct. 1 to line up new packaging to replace non-
specification portable tanks now used to transport certain hydrogen
peroxides.  Under HM-181E provisions effective on that date, portable tanks
no longer will be approved packaging.  Instead, shippers will be subject to
intermediate bulk container (IBC) rules which ban non-specification packaging
for bulk peroxide shipments.

Final rule HM-181E, which specifies intermediate bulk containers as the DOT-
approved packaging for bulk peroxide shipments, defines IBCs as "packaging
other than a portable tank" used for hazardous cargo shipments.

However, the rule allows hazardous materials, except for those poisonous by
inhala-tion, to be packaged until Oct. 1, 1996, according to rules in effect
on Sept. 30, 1991.  Because the HMR in 1991 allowed hydrogen peroxide to be
transported in non-specification portable tanks, IBCs are not mandatory until
Oct. 1, DOT explained.

AIR CARGO DEREGULATION NEARS FOR U.S./CANADA

Deregulation of air cargo between the U.S. and Canada could be implemented by
March under an agreement expected to spur more than $1 billion in economic
activity between the two countries.  A bilateral plan to lift restrictions on
shipments of hazardous and other cargoes was proposed in 1995 and
negotiations are scheduled for completion by March.  U.S.-Canada arrangements
now limit aircraft size, package weight and size and force some aircraft to
make return trips empty.

The new agreement would ease these constraints, unify certain hazardous cargo
rules and allow competitive pricing, Transportation Secretary Federico Pena
said.  Air transportation analysts estimate the air cargo market in both
countries could expand by close to 50% in two years under a more open treaty.

Air shippers say restrictions are an aberration of freer hemispheric trade in
the 1988 U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement and the 1994 North American Free
Trade Agreement.  Deregulation talks began in 1991, but had been stalled
until this plan was announced.

ESCORT TUG BOAT REQUIREMENTS TO TIGHTEN IN 1996

Tanker escort rule expansion is ahead for single-hulled ships carrying
hazardous cargoes in U.S. waters, the Coast Guard said in December.  Several
ports and waterways are slated for inclusion on a February list designating
areas where tug and tow boat assistance will be required.  The action follows
1995 implementation of a rule requiring at least two escort vessels to
accompany hazardous cargo-carrying, single-hulled tankers in Prince William
Sound, Alaska, and Puget Sound, Wash.

Tug boat rules apply to single-hulled tankers over 5,000 gross tons.
Companion vessels could reduce the possibility of grounding or collision when
a tanker loses propulsion or steering, Coast Guard project manager Tom Jordan
explained.  Escort rules are mandated by the 1990 Oil Pollution Act, and are
to be in force until single-hulled ships carrying hazardous cargoes are
phased out in 2015.

A bag with four plies or more must be waterproof to qualify as a UN 5M2

A bag with four plies or more must be waterproof to qualify as a UN 5M2 paper
bag for hazardous materials use, DOT told Southern Bag, Yazoo City, Miss.
The package maker said its bags are made using four plies: the two innermost
are kraft paper, the third is a 3-mil linear low-density plastic laminated to
paper, the outermost is paper.  Plant manager Jimmy Druey explained that the
plastic side of the third ply faces in toward the packaged material and asked
if the construction meets UN 5M2 standards.

DOT cited 178.521(b)(2) requiring that bags be waterproof by the use of a
water-resistant ply as one of the two outermost plies or a water-resistant
barrier of a "suitable protective material" between the two outermost plies.
It said bags of four plies or more that meet all requirements of 178.521 and
tested per subpart M of Part 178 may be marked as a UN 5M2 paper bag.

Initial and recurrent hazardous materials training requirements for federal

Initial and recurrent hazardous materials training requirements for federal
employees were spelled out by DOT in response to inquiries from various
government agencies.  Questioners asked if it is acceptable, under initial
training rules, for a new hire to take an exam without receiving some type of
instruction from the hiring agency.  Noting that a major purpose of training
rules is to ensure that employers provide training for each hazmat employee,
DOT said the rules specify that workers whose jobs involve the transportation
of hazardous materials receive familiarization training covering the HMR.
For initial training, section 172.704(c) specifies training must occur within
90 days of hire and that each new employee must be trained before being
tested.

Questioners also asked if, under recurrent training rules, an employee with
initial training can take a recurrent exam without additional instruction
prior to the exam.  DOT replied that recurrent training must be completed and
documented at least once every two years, and that employees should receive
recurrent hazmat training before being tested .

Regarding questions about use of computer-based training to meet training
requirements, DOT said each agency must determine the most suitable source of
training for its employees.  Computer-based training is acceptable and may be
used provided the general awareness, function specific, safety training, and
testing requirements are fulfilled.

DOT added that a record of each hazmat employee's training over the preceding
two years must be maintained by the employer for the duration of employment
in each hazardous material job and for 90 days thereafter.  A current record
of relevant training is not required to be received from a previous employer,
but may be used to eliminate the need for the new employer to retrain as
required in 172.704 (c)(1)(iii).

Some asphalts in international transport are described differently than in

Some asphalts in international transport are described differently than in
domestic shipment, DOT informed Seneca Petroleum, Crestwood, Ill.  The
company asked about "cutback asphalts," which it said can be subdivided into
rapid curing, medium curing and slow curing.  It noted that the faster the
curing rate, the more volatile the material.

Seneca said its rapid curing asphalt has a flash point of 70 to 90 degrees
Fahrenheit.  Because it is transported at 150 degrees Fahrenheit, it believed
the product does not meet the definition of an elevated temperature material.
The company said it understood that elevated temperature materials are
defined in the HMR as liquids shipped above 212 degrees Fahrenheit or
materials shipped in a liquid phase with a flash point at or above 100
degrees Fahrenheit.

However, company safety director Jim Sniegowski said Illinois transportation
officials interpret the definition to mean any material transported at or
above its flash point.  Thus the state requires Seneca to prepare rapid
curing asphalt for shipment with elevated temperature shipping paper, marking
and placarding rules.  The firm asked for clarification of the elevated
temperature rule and for a proper shipping name.

DOT replied that a material with a flash point below 37.8 degrees Celsius
(100 degrees Fahrenheit) and offered for transportation or transported below
100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit) does not meet the section 171.8
definition of an elevated temperature material.

Therefore, the shipping description for rapid curing asphalt would be
"Asphalt, cut-back, 3, UN1999, PG III," and elevated temperature rules would
not apply.  However, the agency added, for international transportation the
material must be described as "Elevated temperature liquid, flammable, n.o.s.
(Asphalt)."

A cap seal must withstand internal pressure of 100 kPa without the drum

A cap seal must withstand internal pressure of 100 kPa without the drum
closure in place, DOT advised Kelly Air Force Base, Texas.  The agency
covered sections 173.226 and 173.227 rules concerning closures on packagings
used to ship materials poisonous by inhalation.  The Air Force asked what
testing must be done to determine if a cap seal meets the internal pressure
requirements of the HMR.

DOT said no specific test (for example, hydrostatic testing) is required.
Whatever test is used, it must apply the pressure for enough time to
determine if the cap seal can withstand 100 kPa.  That period depends on the
test method used, the agency said.  It added that if a hydrostatic test is
used, for example, a five-minute application of the test pressure is
appropriate.

Adhesives shipped in containers weighing no more 66 pounds and marked in

Adhesives shipped in containers weighing no more 66 pounds and marked in
accordance with HMR part 172 may be transported as a consumer commodity, DOT
told Grand Circuit, Freehold, N.J.  It sells an adhesive called Grand Circuit
Hoof Repair to blacksmiths for gluing on horseshoes and repairing damaged
hoof walls.

The product is sold "as is," ready for use off the shelf, explained general
manager Rita Newell.  Grand Circuit describes the material for shipping as a
flammable liquid, UN1133, class 3 in packing group III.  The adhesive is sold
in 1-, 2- and 3-ounce bot-tles, as well as in 40- and 380-mL plastic tubes.
The veterinary supply company asked for clarification of the ORM-D rating
when transporting its product.

DOT responded an "Adhesive, 3, UN1133, PG II," may be renamed and reclassed
as "Consumer commodity, ORM-D" if it meets criteria in 173.150.  That section
requires the materials not meet the definition of any other hazard class and
not be a hazardous substance, hazardous waste, or marine pollutant.

The agency advised that the inner packagings must be placed in a strong outer
packaging, the completed package must weigh no more than 66 pounds, and the
outer packaging must be marked in accordance with 172.316.

A material subject to EPA uniform hazardous waste manifest rules would be

A material subject to EPA uniform hazardous waste manifest rules would be
described as an "environmentally hazardous substance," DOT advised a Downers
Grove, Ill., firm.  Castrol Industrial described its product as a petroleum
oil, with a flash point of 400 degrees Fahrenheit and containing less than 5%
barium salt.  This material is packaged in 55-gallon (non-bulk) drums or 330-
gallon intermediate bulk containers.

The petroleum product maker noted that the material does not meet the
definition of a marine pollutant, but when tested as a waste, it does meet
EPA's definition of a toxic hazardous waste.  Company regulatory specialist
Marcia Montgomery asked whether a class 9 hazard warning label is appropriate
for shipping.

DOT replied that if the product is not a Division 6.1 poisonous material, a
marine pollutant, or a hazardous substance, then it does not meet the criter-
ia of any hazard class contained in 49 CFR Part 173 and, therefore, is not
subject to regulation.

However, if it is transported as a waste subject to EPA uniform hazardous
waste manifest rules, it would be described as "Waste, environmentally
hazardous substances, liquid, n.o.s., 9, UN 3082, PG III."  Packagings of 119
gallons or less (non-bulk) au-thorized for this material are in 173.203, DOT
said.  Packagings of greater than 119 gallons (bulk) are in 173.241.  In
addition, each bulk and non-bulk packaging must be marked in accordance with
sections 172.301 or 172.302, as applicable, and must be labeled with a Class
9 label as prescribed in section 172.400.

There are no restrictions on the number of inner receptacles in an outer

There are no restrictions on the number of inner receptacles in an outer
packaging as long as the complete package passes the prescribed tests and is
certified, DOT told Mallinckrodt Chemical, Paris, Ky.  Packaging engineer
Greg Smart asked the agency to clarify 173.158 pertaining to the number of
inner receptacles per outer package to ship nitric acid.  Subparagraph (b)(2)
limits the number of inner receptacles to four.  However, subparagraph (f)(2)
does not place a limit on the number of inner receptacles.

DOT advised that 173.158(f)(2) applies to nitric acid of 70% or less con-
centration.  When packaged in 4H1 expanded plastic boxes, the HMR does not
limit the number of inner glass packagings, only that each not exceed 2.5 L.

Paragraph (b)(2), which specifies a limit of four inner receptacles per outer
packaging applies to nitric acid in higher concentrations as long as it does
not contain sulfuric or hydrochloric acid as impurities.  In both cases, DOT
noted, outer packagings constructed of plastic also must conform to
compatibility requirements in 173.24(e).

A commercial invoice and packing list for export/import need not repeat
hazardous materials information on the ocean bill of lading, DOT told Lusk
Shipping, Baltimore.  The firm explained its commercial invoice includes a
description of goods, address of the shipper and seller and payment terms.
Lusk asked if emergency response information and phone numbers, as required
by the Hazardous Materials Regulations, needed to be included on the invoice
or material packing list.

DOT replied no.  The HMR specifies the shipping paper is the document that
contains the hazardous materials data required by sections 172.203 and 204
and emergency phone number required by 172.604(a)(3).  The agency added that
compliance with shipping paper data was met by the ocean bill of lading
containing all data required by sections 172.203, 172.204 and 172.604(a)(3).

Rules requiring manholes on cargo tank trucks apply to date of tank

Rules requiring manholes on cargo tank trucks apply to date of tank
manufacture, not vehicle manufacture, DOT said responding to carrier
inquiries on section 178.337-6, manhole closure requirements.  Several
companies noted manholes or inspection openings were mandated on cargo tanks
made after April 21, 1994, and that tanks made before that date but later
installed on trucks were not required to comply with the manhole rule.

DOT said the April 21 date applies to manufacture of the cargo tank, not its
installation on a motor vehicle.  It added that a cargo tank refers to the
tank fitted with all appurtenances, reinforcements, fittings and closures af-
fecting lading retention installed by the cargo tank manufacturer.

DOT said under the definition of cargo tank in 178.320, appurtenances,
fittings, closures and valves added by truck and tank assemblers or owners
are not part of a cargo tank.  Therefore, a tank marked with an original test
date on or before April 21, 1994, is not required to be fitted with manhole
or inspection openings.  The certificate stating the completed cargo tank
motor vehicle conforms to all DOT specifications and the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers code may be dated after April 21, 1994.

FEDERAL COURTS' EQUITABLE
JURISDICTION IS LIMITED,
RCRA DEFENDANTS REPLY

     The Resource Conservation Recovery Act citizen suit
defendants who are seeking reversal of the Ninth Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals' determination of their liability for
restitutionary damages, on Dec. 28 submitted their reply to the
plaintiffs' arguments to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Meghrig et al.
v. KFC Western Inc., No. 95-83 (U.S.); see Hazardous Waste
Litigation Reporter, Dec. 20, 1995.

     Alan and Margaret Meghrig rejoined that KFC Western Inc.'s
position "is seriously flawed because it proceeds from a series
of false assumptions," including a "misapprehension of the
limited jurisdiction of federal courts to render equitable relief
in the face of a statute such as [RCRA]."

     KFC Western's response, the petitioners contended, "largely
ignores the thorough statutory construction analysis advanced by
Petitioners in favor of a more generalized series of assumptions
tied to Respondent's view of fairness."  RCRA's jurisdictional
statement, argued the Meghrigs, "do[es] not authorize the
district courts to broadly 'take such action as may be
necessary,' but authorize[s] those courts to restrain a person or
to order a person to take other necessary action, or both, and
nothing more."

     The Meghrigs noted the panoply of federal environmental
statutes that contain citizen suit provisions, and stated that
their respective legislative histories, "beginning with the 1970
Clean Air Act and flowing through subsequently enacted federal
environmental statutes, [confirm] congressional intent to limit
the remedies available to citizen plaintiffs by excluding
jurisdiction to award damages."

     The petitioners argued that to accept the respondents'
contention that recognition of restitution under RCRA would not
unduly interfere with CERCLA "would be to accept the proposition
that the massive legislative effort and epic compromise necessary
to enact CERCLA [was] simply swept away by Congress four years
later" with the passage of the 1984 RCRA amendments.

               The Meghrigs challenged KFC Western's assertion that the
trial court possessed jurisdiction to grant equitable relief.
"RCRA's citizen suit provision contains no grant of authority to
the district courts to formulate general federal common law,"
they contended, "and the claims of Respondent KFC, as a private
party, do not fall within any of the four narrow areas in which
federal courts have general common law jurisdiction."

     The petitioners asserted that the Supreme Court's 1992
opinion in Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, upon which
KFC Western relied extensively in arguing for a federal court's
jurisdiction to fashion relief, "has no bearing on the RCRA
statute.  In Franklin, the statute was absolutely silent on the
subject of remedies available to an aggrieved plaintiff....  By
contrast, RCRA provides particularized citizen remedies, and its
legislative history and that of related statutes reaffirm the
limitations on those remedies."

     The Meghrigs averred that the relief sought by KFC Western
does not constitute equitable restitution.  "What Respondent
seeks here is compensation for an injury to its property," they
argued, "and that certainly is distinguished from an equitable
action for specific relief such as restitutionary awards of back-
pay, or return of specific property".

     In 1963, the petitioners inherited a commercial parcel in
Los Angeles from their father.  Gasoline stations had been
previously operated on the site for decades; all underground
storage tanks had been removed well before the Meghrigs took
title.

     In 1975, the petitioners sold the land to the respondent,
who established a Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise on the site.
In the course of renovations in 1988, petroleum contamination was
discovered, and KFC Western spent some $211,000 in complying with
a cleanup order from the Los Angeles Department of Health.

     When the Meghrigs refused KFC Western's reimbursement
demands, the respondent started the present litigation in the
U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.  The
trial court granted the Meghrigs' dismissal motion in March 1992,
holding that no "imminent and substantial endangerment" existed
to support a RCRA claim, and stating that RCRA's citizen suit
provision solely made injunctive relief available.

     In March 1995, the Ninth Circuit reversed by a 2-1 margin.
The appellate court concluded that RCRA's "imminent and
substantial endangerment" language did not act as a time-bar, and
a RCRA citizen suit plaintiff could make demand for money
damages.  The Meghrigs lodged their certiorari petition the
following July, and the Supreme Court agreed to review the matter
last October.  Oral argument in the matter is scheduled for
Jan. 10, at 10:00 a.m.

               John P. Zaimes and Clifton J. McFarland of McClintock,
Weston, Benshoof, Rochefort, Rubalcava & MacCuish, Los Angeles,
represent Alan and Margaret Meghrig.

     Daniel Romano and Sharon Corda of the Law Office of Daniel
Romano, Santa Monica, CA, represent KFC Western Inc.

VERTAC RECEIVER LOSES
BID TO SUE THIRD PARTIES
FOR DIOXIN CLEANUP COSTS

     A federal judge in Little Rock on Dec. 11 denied a motion by
the court-appointed receiver for the bankrupt Vertac Chemical
Corp. to sue other parties to recover cleanup costs that could be
used to pay Vertac's environmental debts to the federal and state
governments for the cleanup of a bayou polluted by runoff from
the plant.  United States v. Vertac Chemical Corp., No. LR-C-80-
109 (ED AR).

     U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. of the Eastern
District of Arkansas noted that the State of Arkansas is already
seeking to remedy environmental damage to the bayou and he said
he was not persuaded that the receiver's limited resources should
be used to fund an action that the state intends to pursue.

     Vertac's Jacksonville, AR, plant was acquired by Hercules
Inc. in 1961.  Hercules had manufactured the defoliant Agent
Orange at the plant from 1964 to 1968, pursuant to a government
contract.  Thousands of barrels of dioxin, one of the byproducts
of Agent Orange, and other hazardous wastes contaminated the soil
at the plant site and polluted Rocky Branch Creek, which runs
through the site and empties into Bayou Meto.  The government had
commenced a CERCLA action in 1987 to recoup the costs of
remediating the site.

     Court-appointed bankruptcy receiver Lee S. Thalheimer of the
Little Rock firm of Arnold, Grobmyer & Haley, had asked the
court's permission to file a citizen's suit under the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act against others who may be liable
for polluting Bayou Meto.

     Judge Howard observed that Furrer v. Brown, a recent Eighth
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals case, held that plaintiffs may only
seek injunctive relief, not a monetary judgment, under RCRA and,
therefore, the receiver would not be able to recover any monies
from an RCRA suit.  (Furrer v. Brown, 62 F.3d 1092 (8th Cir.
1995).

     He took note of the fact that the Ninth Circuit has decided
the same issue differently in KFC Western v. Meghrig, 49 F.3d 518
(9th Cir. 1995) and that the U.S. Supreme Court has granted a
petition for writ of certiorari in that case to decide the issue
of whether recovery of cleanup costs is available in a private
action under RCRA.

     Judge Howard also denied Thalheimer's request to be granted
the authority to place restrictions on the future use of the
Vertac plant.  The receiver wanted to authorize Hercules to
clean, salvage and sell plant equipment to help pay off
creditors.  Hercules had supported the request but the government
opposed it.

     Judge Howard agreed with the United States that the
receiver's request was overly broad and vague.  However, to
encourage the parties to work together, the judge dismissed the
request without prejudice to renew to give the parties a chance
to work out their differences.

6TH CIR.'S $1.5M FINE
AFFIRMANCE, CORP. OFFICER
LIABILITY FINDING APPEALED

     The Michigan RCRA defendants whose $1.5 million penalty for
noncompliance with closure deadlines was upheld by the Sixth
Circuit last July, on Dec. 1 petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court
for writ of certiorari.  Production Plated Plastics Inc. et al.
v. United States et al., Nos. 95-878 (U.S.); see Hazardous Waste
Litigation Reporter, Sept. 6, 1995.

     In addition to challenging the fine as unconstitutionally
excessive, the petitioners exhorted the High Court to "determine,
once and for all, whether Congress intended corporate officer
liability under RCRA and CERCLA, and if so, under what standard."

     The litigation stems from the operation of a chrome plating
facility in Richland, MI, which opened in 1966 and was acquired
three years later by petitioner Production Plated Plastics Inc.
("PPP").  PPP, as did the prior owner, stored sludge and process
water in on-site surface inpoundments.

     In 1977, Michigan sued PPP under the state Water Resources
Conservation Act after hexavelent chrome was discovered in the
groundwater in the plant's vicinity.  PPP closed the impoundments
in the course of the remediation plan it had agreed to with the
Michigan Department of Natural Resources.

     PPP applied for RCRA interim status for its impoundments in
1980.  PPP was unable thereafter to obtain insurance or a closure
bond, and it lost its interim status in 1985.  The federal and
state governments brought the present litigation in 1987,
alleging failure to submit a closure plan within 15 days of
losing RCRA interim status, and failure to complete closure
activities within 180 days of the state's approval of closure
plan.  Also named to the suit were the affiliated Michigan City
Plastics Co. Inc. (MCP) and Michael Ladney, the controlling
officer of both entities.
               The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan
determined in 1990 that Ladney may be held jointly and severally
liable.  The trial court granted the government's demand for
permanent, mandatory injunctive mandatory relief in 1991, and the
Sixth Circuit affirmed the following year.

     After a trial on penalties, Judge Benjamin F. Gibson in 1992
imposed a $1.5 million penalty on the defendants, and ordered the
implementation of a $2.4 million trust fund to pay for
groundwater monitoring over 30 years.  The trial court also
appointed a third-party trustee to marshall the defendants'
assets to comply with the injunction.

     The Sixth Circuit affirmed in an unpublished per curiam
opinion last July 19.  The panel found no violation of the
defendants' due process rights in that Ladney operated his
businesses without regard for corporate form, and concluded that
the fine imposed was well below the $90 million potential
maximum.

     In their petition, the defendants assert that while "courts
have found joint and several liability for RCRA compliance,
penalties should be assessed separately and not jointly and
severally... [B]y clear implication, cases explaining the
requirements of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments (Due Process
Analysis) and Eighth Amendment (Excessive Punishment Analysis)
require that a court analyze behavior individually when assessing
a penalty sought by the government that amounts to punishment."

     The petitioners asserted that "[s]ince fines under RCRA are
exclusively punitive, they are fully subject to the Eighth
Amendment's prohibition against excessive fines.... [N]either the
District Court nor Sixth Circuit gave anything but cursory
consideration to the possibility that the $1.5 million fine, the
largest penalty in the Western District of Michigan's history,
could be excessive."

     As to the issue of owner/operator liability under both
CERCLA and RCRA, the petitioners argued that those federal courts
that have extended such liability to corporate officers have
ignored Supreme Court precedent concerning statutory
construction.  "RCRA does not define 'owner' or 'operator' to
include corporate officers, employees or shareholders," the
defendants contended.  "Likewise, nothing in RCRA's legislative
history suggests that Congress intended the joint and several
liability of corporate officers for the violations of a
corporation."

     Douglas W. Van Essen of Law, Weathers & Richardson, Grand
Rapids, MI, submitted the petition on behalf of Production Plated
Plastics Inc., Michigan City Plastics Co. Inc. and Michael
Ladney.

OCCIDENTAL PAYS $129M
TO CLOSE A CHAPTER
ON LOVE CANAL

     Occidental Chemical Corp. has agreed to pay the U.S.
government $129 million in cleanup costs and interest to settle a
16-year-old lawsuit resulting from decades of pollution at Love
Canal, the case that spurred Congress to enact the Superfund Law
of 1980.  United States et al. v. Hooker Chemical Corp. et al.,
No. 79-CV-990C (WD NY); see Hazardous Waste Litigation Reporter,
June 3, 1991.

     Under the proposed consent decree, announced Dec. 21,
Occidental Chemical Corp. (Oxychem) will pay $102 million to the
Environmental Protection Agency and $28 million to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  FEMA handled the initial
cleanup and relocation of Love Canal residents.

     From 1942 to 1953, Oxychem's corporate predecessor, Hooker
Chemical, dumped an estimated 22,000 tons of toxic chemicals and
hazardous wastes at Love Canal from its Niagara Falls
manufacturing plant.  The site was eventually covered over and
deeded to the City of Niagara Falls.  Homes and a school were
later built on and near Love Canal.  Chemicals began seeping into
the houses in the 1970s sickening residents; one resident, Lois
Gibbs, led a crusade to expose Hooker's actions and clean up the
site.

     In 1979, the federal government and New York State brought
suit against Hooker.  The federal government initially sought
compensation of more than $200 million in cleanup costs under
CERCLA and the state sought $250 million in punitive damages.
Oxychem was held liable in the liability phase of the trial, but
the state's claims for punitive damages were denied.

     In June 1994, Oxychem agreed to pay the state $98 million to
settle the remaining state claims.  The U.S. Army has also agreed
to pay the government $8 million for its share of the costs for
cleaning up hazardous waste that it dumped at the site during
World War II.

     The consent decree, which is expected to receive final
approval in 30 days, eliminates the need for a second trial on
damages.  Under its terms, Oxychem will pay the $129 million in
four installments over three years, beginning three months after
the court grants final approval.

     While the proposed settlement closes out the federal and
state cleanup claims, it does not end the litigation over Love
Canal.  The City of Niagara Falls is seeking $4 million in costs
and interest and 900 former residents have personal injury
lawsuits still pending.  In the wake of the federal and state
settlements, Niagara Falls expects that it will soon reach a
settlement with the company to end its suit as well.
               In announcing the settlement, U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno called it "the transformation of an environmental disaster
called Love Canal into a success story.  It stands for the
principle that when people make a mess, they should clean it up."

     A spokesman for Oxychem said that the company has never
denied liability, but that the settlement represents a compromise
among the parties on the amount of compensation, rather than
fines or penalties.  The agreement, he said avoids having to go
through a protracted trial on damages.

     Oxychem is represented by Steven K. Yablonski of Piper &
Marbury, Washington, DC.  The federal government is represented
by Steven Novick and Steven R. Baer of the U.S. Justice
Department, Washington, DC.

WD KY WON'T RECONSIDER
ORDER ALLOWING RP
SECTION 107(a) COST RECOVERY

     U.S. District Judge Joseph H. McKinley Jr. of the Western
District of Kentucky on Dec. 27 refused a defense bid to
reconsider his November ruling finding a responsible party CERCLA
plaintiff capable of suing for cost recovery under Section
107(a).  Barmet Aluminum Corp. v. Doug Brantley & Sons Inc. et
al., No. 4:95-CV-93-M (WD KY); see Hazardous Waste Litigation
Reporter, Dec. 6, 1995.

     The judge also refused the defendants request for
certification for interlocutory appeal to the Sixth Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals.

     In March 1995, plaintiff Barmet Aluminum Corp. entered into
a consent order with the EPA to clean up the Brantley Landfill
site; Barmet was first named as a potentially responsible party
regarding the site in 1989.

     Barmet thereafter lodged a CERCLA Section Section 107/113
complaint against excavator Doug Brantley & Sons Inc. and its
corporate principals.  The defendants argued for the dismissal of
the allegations under Section 107, contending that Barmet's
status as a responsible party limited it to seeking Section
113(f) contribution.

     Judge McKinley held last Nov. 22 that Section 107(a)(4)(B)
imposes liability for "any other necessary costs of response
incurred by any other person consistent with the national
liability plan," and refuse to exclude responsible parties from
the defined "any other person."   He stated that the only
district court within the circuit to have addressed the issue has
twice allowed responsible parties and potentially responsible
parties to sue for Section 107 cost recovery.

               Kim K. Burke, Robert A. Bilott and Charles H. Pangburn III
of Taft, Stettinius & Hollister, Cincinnati, represent the
plaintiff.

     J. Anthony Goebel, Joseph J. Zaluski, George L. Seay Jr. and
Clinton J. Elliot of Wyatt, Tarrant & Combs, Louisville, KY,
represent the defendants.

     The judge stated that CERCLA's waiver of sovereign immunity,
which he had previously held to override the Corps' assertion of
immunity under the Flood Control Act of 1928, applied to the
plaintiffs' state statutory claims as well.

     Plaintiffs Crowley Marine Services Inc. and others, along
with the Corps, were sued in 1991-1992 by the Washington
Department of Ecology over soil and groundwater contamination in
the vicinity of a levee and drainage system owned and operated by
the Corps.  The levee and drainage system, situated on the bank
of the Columbia River, is part of a federal flood control
project.  The plaintiffs performed remediation in satisfaction of
the state suit, and brought the present action against some 20
parties who refused to participate in the cleanup.

     In his Oct. 10 order addressing the Corps' dismissal motion,
Judge Quackenbush agreed that the Flood Act barred the
plaintiffs' count under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA).  He
refused to find the Corps immunized on the CERCLA claims, finding
that the defendant asserted none of the enumerated defenses to
the sovereign immunity waiver, and determining that CERCLA
contains no express exception regarding Flood Act immunity.

     The Corps sought clarification of the order, seeking a
determination that the FTCA ruling carried over to the
plaintiffs' common-law tort claims, and that CERCLA's sovereign
immunity did not apply to the claims under Washington's hazardous
materials statutes.  The plaintiffs responded that CERCLA's
sovereign immunity unequivocally applies to state environmental
statutes.

     Judge Quackenbush primarily agreed that the plaintiffs'
claims for negligence/negligence per se, strict liability,
trespass, and nuisance "were applicable to the Corps only through
the FTCA," and thus were dismissed.

     In considering the claims under Washington's state Superfund
law, the Model Toxics Control Act (MTCA), the court wrote that
CERCLA Section 9620(a)(4) "provides, in pertinent part, that
'State laws concerning removal and remedial action, including
State laws regarding enforcement, shall apply' to facilities of
the United States...

     "The MTCA is similar in language to CERCLA," the judge
continued.  "The court finds that CERCLA's waiver of immunity, in
conjunction with the form and substance of the MTCA, require the
conclusion that the MTCA is applicable to the site owned and
operated by the Corps."  The court agreed with the Corps that the
waiver solely extends to sites currently owned or operated by the
United States.

     Judge Quackenbush then addressed the plaintiffs' claims
under the Washington Hazardous Waste Management Act (HWMA), the
state RCRA equivalent.  The court looked to the 1992 amendment to
RCRA Section 6961, which restated and emphasized the waiver of
sovereign immunity in the statute.  "The 1992 amendment was a
clear effort on behalf of Congress to equally apply environmental
standards to private citizens and the federal government," the
judge wrote.

     The judge rejected the Corps' assertion that the claim for
relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act should be dismissed for
lack of an independent basis of federal jurisdiction.
"Plaintiffs' CERCLA claims were not dismissed, and these claims
provide an independent jurisdictional basis, the court stated.

     Judge Quackenbush lastly rejected the Corps' bid to dismiss
the claim for the reasonable costs of negotiation with the
Washington state authorities, including attorneys' fees.  The
Corps asserted that such recovery was barred under the U.S.
Supreme Court's 1994 ruling in Key Tronic v. U.S.; the court
rejoined that the plaintiffs "seek recovery of attorneys' fees
under several statutes, including CERCLA, the RCRA, the MTCA, and
the HWMA.  Each of those statutes provides for potential recovery
of attorneys' fees."

3RD CIR.: NEIGHBORS,
VISITORS TO WASTE SITE
ARE NOT KNOWN CREDITORS

     Neighbors of a dump site contaminated by low-level radiation
were not known creditors and, therefore, the corporate owner of
the sites had no obligation to provide them with actual notice
when it went into bankruptcy, the Third Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals ruled on Dec. 18.  Chemetron Corp. v. Jones et al.,
No. 94-3371 (3rd Cir.).

     From 1965 to 1975, Chemetron Corp. owned and operated a
manufacturing facility that made an antimony oxide catalyst
utilizing depleted plutonium and a nearby landfill where it
dumped waste products from that manufacturing process in Cuyahoga
Heights, OH.  Chemetron sold the sites in 1975, but became
involved in cleanup efforts between 1980 and 1988 after it was
discovered that the sites were contaminated with radioactive
waste.

     In 1988, Chemetron filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of
Pennsylvania.  The court issued a claims bar date order fixing
the last day for creditors to file claims as May 31, 1988.
Chemetron sent the required actual notice to all of its known
creditors and also voluntarily placed advertisements in the New
York Times and Wall Street Journal in an effort to reach any
unknown creditors.

     In 1992, 15 individuals filed suit against Chemetron and its
successors in interest in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common
Pleas claiming to have been injured from exposure to radioactive
and toxic chemicals at the dump site.  Eventually the list of
plaintiffs grew to 21.  Two of the plaintiffs had lived in houses
near the site and the rest were periodic visitors to the houses.

     Chemetron moved to dismiss the suit, arguing that any such
claim had been discharged in the bankruptcy proceedings which had
ended in 1990.  The plaintiffs then petitioned the bankruptcy
court to be allowed to file late claims.   In August 1993, the
bankruptcy court granted the petition, finding that the
plaintiffs were known creditors who had been entitled to actual
notice of the proceedings and the claims bar date.  The
bankruptcy court then reserved ruling on the issue of whether the
plaintiffs' claims were dischargeable.

     Chemetron appealed the bankruptcy court ruling to U.S.
District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, which
reversed the bankruptcy court's grant of the motion to file late
claims.  The district court held that the plaintiffs were not
known creditors and that the notice published in the two national
newspapers were sufficient to alert them to the bankruptcy
proceedings.  The district court also ruled, without explanation,
that the plaintiffs' claims were dischargeable as a result of the
bankruptcy action.

     The plaintiffs appealed to the Third Circuit, which affirmed
the district court finding that the plaintiffs are unknown
creditors.  In Tulsa Professional Collection Service Inc. v.
Roper, 485 U.S. 478, 490 (1988), the U.S. Supreme Court
characterized a known creditor as one whose identity is either
known or "reasonably ascertainable by the debtor" Circuit Judge
Jane R. Roth wrote.  Generally, debtors are expected to identify
known creditors through a careful search of their own books and
records and further efforts are not required, she explained.

     In this case, she said, the bankruptcy court replaced the
"reasonably ascertainable" standard with a "reasonably
foreseeable" standard.  Under that test, the bankruptcy court
said Chemetron knew or should have known that it was reasonably
foreseeable that it would suffer claims from individuals living
near the sites making them known creditors.

     This "reasonably foreseeable" standard is an incorrect rule
of law that imposes an impossible burden on debtors, the Third
Circuit found.  None of the claimants currently live near the
site and some have moved as far away as Texas.  "We are hard
pressed to conceive of any way the debtor could identify, locate,
and provide actual notice to these claimants," Judge Roth said.

     Having affirmed the district court's ruling that the
plaintiffs were unknown claimants in the bankruptcy action and
that the newspaper notices, therefore, were sufficient to inform
them of the proceedings, the circuit court found that the
district court erred in failing to consider whether the
plaintiffs' failure to file their claims in a timely manner was
due to "excusable neglect."  The appellate panel remanded that
issue to the district court with instructions to consider the
totality of the circumstances and the potential impact on
Chemetron.

     The Third Circuit also vacated the district court's ruling
that the plaintiffs' claims were discharged by the bankruptcy
action and remanded that issue to the bankruptcy court.  Because
the bankruptcy court had postponed ruling on the issue of
discharge, it was not an appealable order and, therefore, was not
properly before the district court, the Third Circuit said.

     Circuit Judge H. Lee Sarokin concurred in the judgment but
said that the Third Circuit went to far in discarding the
"reasonably ascertainable" test entirely.  "These tests are not
mutually exclusive, or even at odds.  They address separate
issues," Judge Sarokin wrote.  One has to do with whether a
debtor knew or should have known a claim would be brought while
the other has to do with the debtor's ability to identify a
potential claimant, he said.

     The Jones plaintiffs were represented by William Mitchell
and Deborah J. Papushak of Armstrong, Mitchell & Damiani,
Cleveland.  Chemetron was represented Dennis G. Terez of Squire,
Sanders & Dempsey, Cleveland and George L. Cass of Buchanan,
Ingersoll, Pittsburgh.

IL APP. CT. AFFIRMS
CARRRIER WIN ON LATE
NOTICE GROUNDS

     A company that waited 14 months to notify its insurers that
it might be partly liable for cleaning a hazardous waste site
cannot claim insurance coverage, the Illinois Appellate Court,
First District stated in an opinion published Dec. 14.
Industrial Coatings Group Inc. v. American Motorists Insurance
Co. et al., No. 1-94-1491 (IL App. Ct., 1st Dist.).

     Industrial Coatings Group Inc. learned in February 1986 that
it faced potential liability for hazardous waste contamination at
a site in Griffith, IN, where Industrial's predecessor had sent
used machinery solvent for processing and return.  The appellate
panel wrote that the policyholder should have notified its
carriers at that time.

     The predecessor Joanna Western Mills Co. had sent dirty
solvent to the American Chemical Services site from 1959 to 1985.
In operating the site for more than 25 years, American Chemical
buried more than 20,000 drums containing hazardous materials at
the site.  Many of the drums leaked or were punctured while other
hazardous materials were pumped into retention ponds on the site.

     After testing by the EPA, the American Chemical site was
designated as a Superfund site.  Industrial Coatings' insurance
policies provided that in the event of an occurrence, written
notice to the insurers giving the particulars was required "as
soon as practicable."  The insured, however, did not give written
notice to the insurers until more than 14 months after it had
received the EPA's letter requesting voluntary participation in
the site cleanup.

     The Cook County Circuit Court found that Industrial Coatings
gave its insurance companies late notice, that it thereby
breached a condition precedent to coverage under its insurance
policies and that the company, therefore, had no right to obtain
coverage for the pollution claim which had been asserted against
it.

     The state appellate panel affirmed, finding that the delay
in notice precluded coverage.  "Under Illinois law, a delay of
even a few months in giving notice breaches the policy as a
matter of law, defeats coverage and justifies the entry of
summary judgment for the insurance company," the court said.

AZ APP. CT. REVERSES
INSURER WIN ON TCE
COVERAGE BAD FAITH SUIT

     The Arizona Court of Appeals on Nov. 30 overturned a trial
court's dismissal of a bad faith claim lodged by an environmental
tort defendant against its insurers.  Tucson Airport Authority v.
Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's, London et al., No. CV-95-0052
(AZ Ct. App.).

     The panel found that the policyholder adequately pleaded a
claim for the carriers' threat to drop a defense of a related
action in order to ensure the insured's cooperation in another
suit, and then withdrawing coverage because of the policyholder's
cooperation.

     The Tucson Airport Authority (TAA) had been named to two
class actions in the 1980s stemming from the disposal of TCE on
airport property.  The TAA settled with the class claimants for
$35 million in the understanding that recovery would be sought
only from the TAA's insurers.  Those class plaintiffs, in turn,
intervened in the declaratory judgment action brought against TAA
by its carriers.  The insurers contended that coverage was
unavailable to the intervenors, as the TAA was not liable for TCE
disposal by TAA's lessees.

     TAA was subsequently named to a third class suit (the Bahrs
suit); it tendered the Bahrs suit to its carriers, who agreed to
defend under a reservation of rights.  At this juncture, TAA
contended, the insurers threatened to drop the defense of the
Bahrs suit if TAA did anything to impede the insurers' attempts
to contest coverage in the declaratory judgment action.

     TAA complied, and the insurers obtained summary judgments
against the intervenors in the declaratory judgment action.  The
carriers then sought to have these judgments declared res
judicata in TAA's pending cross-action for declaratory judgment.
When TAA contested the insurers' res judicata motion, TAA was
allegedly informed that such response action cost TAA "all
defense coverage and indemnity coverage for any and all
third-party tort liability claims arising from groundwater
contamination, including insurance coverage for the third-party
liability claims presented against TAA in the Bahrs (putative)
class action."

     TAA then amended its declaratory judgment suit to include a
bad faith count, arguing that the carriers breached their duty to
reasonably balance their interests against the interests of the
policyholder.  The Pima County Circuit Court dismissed the bad
faith count.

     In its reversal, the state appellate panel cited to Arizona
Supreme Court precedent stating that "one of the benefits that
flow[s] from the insurance contract is the insured's expectation
that his insurance company will not wrongfully deprive him of the
very security for which he bargained or expose him to the
catastrophe from which he sought protection....  Conduct by the
insurer which does destroy the security or impair the protection
purchased breaches the implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing implied in the contract."

     After finding the bad faith allegations adequately plead,
the court considered the insurers' contention that the claim was
based on privileged communications made during pending coverage
actions by the insurers' counsel.  The panel was persuaded by the
California Supreme Court's 1985 ruling in White v. Western Title,
which drew a distinction between a bad faith claim "based
squarely on a privileged communication, such as an action for
defamation, and one based upon an underlying course of conduct
evidenced by the communication."

     The court found that the "gravamen of TAA's bad faith claim
is not a communication, but a course of 'wrongful and tortious'
conduct evidenced by the insurers' actions and communications
during the coverage actions. Furthermore, TAA's claim does not
assail a pleading but instead alleges that its insurers followed
a course of conduct in which they failed to perform their duties
fairly and in good faith."

SD NY DENIES CARRIERS
JUDGMENT ON TRIGGER OF
COVERAGE, LOST POLICY

     U.S. District Judge Kevin Thomas Duffy of the Southern
District of New York on Nov. 22 denied summary judgment to
Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. and Liberty Mutual Insurance Co.
on a policyholder's coverage demands stemming from environmental
liabilities at a North Carolina site.  Unimax Corp. et al. v.
Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. et al., No. 92 Civ. 6115 (KTD) (SD
NY).

     The judge rejected the carriers' contention that North
Carolina law should be construed so as to find that no
occurrences triggering coverage happened during their policy
periods.

     In 1968, the insured Unimax Corp. purchased for its
subsidiary, JFD Electronics Corp., a television antenna
production facility located in Oxford, NC.  JFD leased the site
and operated the facility over the ensuing 11 years.  In 1979,
JFD sublet the site to an affiliate of Ventura Electronics Corp.,
which also assumed the facility's operations.  The following
year, JFD purchased the remaining interest from Unimax and
conveyed the site to Ventura.

     In 1986, volatile organic compounds were discovered in the
site's groundwater; the state and the EPA commenced a cleanup the
following year.  In 1988, Ventura's successor brought a CERCLA
cost recovery action against Unimax and JFD.  The EPA notified
the insureds that they were regarded as potentially responsible
parties with respect to the site in the fall of 1989; the
policyholders asserted they first learned of the contamination in
August 1988.

     That same month, the insureds tendered notice to both
Lumbermens and Liberty Mutual; both carriers refused coverage.
Lumbermens had written Unimax and JFD umbrella comprehensive
catastrophe liability coverage from 1969 through 1971; the
insureds asserted that Lumbermens had also issued them primary
policies covering 1968 through 1972.  Liberty Mutual issued the
policyholders primary CGL coverage from 1975 through 1979.

     Judge Duffy first considered the insurers' bid for summary
judgment on the ground that under North Carolina law, an
occurrence does not take place until discovery of contamination,
and that such discovery did not occur within the policy period.
The insureds rejoined that New York law should be applied, and
that an injury-in-fact trigger should be recognized.

     The court preliminarily concluded that no conflict existed
between the laws of the interested states.  "This case," the
judge wrote, "is centered on insurance policies " i.e. contracts
" and the appropriate conflicts analysis begins with each State's
contract laws.  New York and North Carolina apply the same rules
for contract interpretation."

     In looking to the policy language, the court found that it
"clearly states that an occurrence takes place if physical injury
results during the policy period."  The judge further noted that
under either state's precedents, "contamination is deemed to be
physical injury."  The court further rejected Liberty Mutual's
contention that the insureds never responded to its summary
judgment with evidence demonstrating that contamination occurred
within the policy period.  "The focus of Liberty Mutual's motion
was that contamination was not considered under the law to be
property damage until the discovery of the damage," Judge Duffy
stated.

     The court then considered the policyholder's cross-motion
for summary judgment on the issue of the carriers' duty to
defend.  The judge granted the motion as to Lumbermens, finding
the insurer to have made no argument beyond the trigger issue.
Liberty Mutual's policy contained a pollution exclusion clause,
which the insurer argued would void coverage if New York law were
applicable to the dispute.

     On the present facts, however, the court noted that "an
endorsement to the contract specifically deleted the pollution
exclusion clause with regards to operations in North Carolina.
If New York law governs these policies, that endorsement was
misleading and created, at least, an ambiguity [that] must be
construed in favor of the insured."

     The court ultimately refused the insureds judgment against
Liberty Mutual, finding the insurer had raised a genuine of
material fact as to the plaintiffs' knowledge of their claims.
JFD had knowledge of its potential liabilities as early as 1972,
Liberty Mutual had argued and, therefore, its notice was
untimely.
               The policyholders claimed that Liberty Mutual waived its
late notice defense by not raising the defense in its 1990
disclaimer of coverage; the carrier responded that it had
insufficient knowledge of the underlying facts until discovery
had commenced.  Judge Duffy denied the insureds summary judgment
on the waiver issue.

     The court lastly denied Lumbermens summary judgment with
respect to the two CGL policies it asserted were lost.  With
respect to the 1968 through 1971 policy ("1ZL policy"), the court
noted that the insureds proffered some 100 pages bearing the 1ZL
number that was turned over by Lumbermens during discovery.  "The
only pages known to be missing are two endorsements and the
policy jacket," the court wrote.  "I find it incredible that
Lumbermens would retain this file, which imposes liability, but
lose the documents that may have relieved Lumbermens of
liability."  Judge Duffy stated that liability would be measured
according to the terms of the policy as discovered in the
insurer's files.

     As to the 1971 through 1972 policy ("8ZL policy"), the judge
found that the plaintiffs had demonstrated its existence, due to
a reference to it in Lumbermens' umbrella policy.  The court
denied  the insureds summary judgment, however, finding that
material issues of fact remained concerning the 8ZL policy's
content.

     Bruce Bienboim and Aidan Synnott of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind,
Wharton & Garrison, New York, represent the insureds.

     Frank Torres of Evans, Orr, Pacelli, Norton & Laffan, P.C.,
New York, and Judith Fournie Helms, Catherine M. Connelly-Warren
and Katherine E. Tammaro of Tressler, Soderstrom, Maloney &
Preiss, Chicago, represent Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co.  Robert
L. Joyce of Wilson, Elser, Moskowitz, Edelman & Dicker, New York,
represent Liberty Mutual Insurance Co.

CONGRESSIONAL OUTLOOK FOR 1996 in the environmental and workplace health

CONGRESSIONAL OUTLOOK FOR 1996 in the environmental and workplace health and
safety areas is reviewed.  1996 begins with uncertainty over the future of
many bills, among them Superfund, clean water, regulatory reform, RCRA reform;
the 104th Congress is seen as extremely anti-environment by many environmental
leaders.  Many predict that there will be continued attacks on environmental
legislation by use of indirect methods, such as riders on appropriations
bills.  Superfund sites will cost $2.5 billion annually for cleanup; some
method must be used to raise more money, because Superfund itself only
provides $1 billion a year.  Environmental groups want groundwater cleanup
separate from industry cleanup responsibilities.  Tax authority for Superfund
expired on Dec. 31, 1995; the corporate environmental income tax and chemical
and petroleum excise taxes that raised Superfund monies must be reauthorized.
      A number of bills have bipartisan support:  H.R. 2036 would reform
land-disposal restrictions under RCRA; safe drinking water (S. 1316) requires
risk assessment and cost-benefit analyses to set standards, but exempts
by-products of chlorination (trihalomethanes).
      Legislation to reform OSHA failed to move in 1995, and prospects are dim
for 1996.  Bills under consideration would move OSHA away from strict
enforcement and more toward technical support and assistance to firms.  These
changes are not well supported by industry and are vigorously opposed by
labor.  (Chemical & Engineering News, pp. 14-20, Jan. 8, 1996)

BREAST IMPLANT SETTLEMENT, revised recently, is underway.  A federal district
court judge ordered the printing and mailing of a revised offer to silicone
gel breast implant recipients, which promises to speed payments to them from
three major manufacturers--Bristol-Myers Squibb, Baxter Health Care, and
3M--but excludes Dow Corning.  Overwhelming costs of litigation forced Dow
Corning, the maker of about half of the implants, into bankruptcy.  The
revised settlement seeks to avoid thousands of court cases that would
otherwise clog the judicial system for years.  The total value of the revised
settlement is nearly impossible to assess.  (Chemical & Engineering News, pp.

DIOXIN REASSESSMENT is being examined by the House of Representatives
Subcommittee on Energy & Environment in an attempt to see how science is used
by EPA.  Several hearings looked into EPA's long-running reassessment of the
health effects of dioxins and dioxin-like compounds.  The goal of the hearings
was not to determine if EPA were right or wrong but to find out if the agency
is making appropriate use of the resources available.  The implication is that
EPA has used these resources selectively to support public policy objectives
that may not stand up to more rigorous scientific scrutiny.  (Chemical &

AIR POLLUTION review of epidemiological evidence of health effects of

AIR POLLUTION review of epidemiological evidence of health effects of
particulates is summarized.  Acute exposure to elevated levels of particulates
has been associated with increased cardiopulmonary mortality, hospitalization
for respiratory disease, and increased incidence and duration of respiratory
symptoms, as well as exacerbation of asthma, declines in lung function, and
restricted activity.  Small deficits in lung function, higher risk of chronic
respiratory disease and symptoms, and increased mortality have also been
associated with chronic exposure to respirable particulates.  Health effects
have been observed at levels below current U.S. National Ambient Air Quality
Standards.  Although the biological mechanisms involved are poorly understood,
recent evidence supports the hypothesis that such air pollutants are a risk
factor for respiratory disease and cardiopulmonary mortality.  (Inhalation

ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS, pollutants ubiquitous in the environment, may disrupt
human fertility and possibly the ability to reproduce.  Both male and female
reproductive health are being disturbed by environmentally occurring chemicals
that change fertility by causing, among numerous effects, low sperm counts,
testicular abnormalities, and altered sexual development of both male and
female fetuses, as well as cancers and other diseases of both sexes.  Among
the chemicals cited as endocrine disruptors are PHTHALATES, ingredients in
various plastics, paints, inks, and varnishes; ALKYL PHENOLS, produced by
microbial degradation of detergent, paint, herbicide, and cosmetic chemicals;
and ORGANOCHLORINE PESTICIDES, including DDT (CAS RN 50-29-3), ALDRIN CAS RN
309-00-2), and DIELDRIN (CAS RN 60-57-1).  Studies on these chemicals began
because certain wildlife, exposed to these substances, had suffered changes in
reproductive ability.  The implications for human reproduction are discussed

occupational health monitoring for dust and pneumoconiosis and to assess dust
levels and the prevalence of pneumoconiosis.  In only 13 (16%) of the 82
foundries responding were regular periodic full-sized chest radiographs done.
Dust levels were measured every 3 years or more frequently in 20 foundries
(24%).  Uncontrolled dust hazard was evident in nine foundries surveyed
between 1983 and 1992.  The prevalence of silicosis ranged from 0% to 10.3%
and increased with duration of service.  The study provided convincing
evidence of neglect of occupational health by the foundry industry.  (S Afr

DOMESTIC WASTE COLLECTION was reviewed in the light of occupational health
problems.  The last decade has seen a growing interest in recycling  domestic
wastes, and action plans to increase such recycling have been adopted by many
governments.  In 1975, an excess risk for chronic bronchitis was reported for
waste collectors in Switzerland and data from the Danish Registry of
Occupational Accidents and Diseases also indicate an excess risk for pulmonary
problems among waste collectors compared with the total work force.  High
incidence rates of gastrointestinal problems, irritation of the eye and skin,
and symptoms of organic dust toxic syndrome (influenza-like symptoms, cough,
muscle pains, fever, fatigue, headache) have been reported among workers
collecting the biodegradable fraction of domestic waste.  They may be exposed
to multiple agents such as dust-containing bacteria, endotoxins, mold spores,
glucans, volatile organic compounds, and diesel exhaust. (Sci Total Environ

COAL MINE DUST hydroxyl radical generation and possible implications for coal
workers'pneumoconiosis (CWP) are reviewed and discussed.  Occupational
exposure to coal mine dust causes CWP and other pulmonary diseases by
mechanisms that remain unclear.  Because the hydroxyl radicals (-OH) may play
an important role in the pathogenesis of CWP, the potential role of bituminous
coal mine dust samples for catalyzing the generation of -OH from hydrogen
peroxide were studied.  Based on the results, it was proposed that higher
concentrations of surface iron in coal mine dust may be involved in the
generation of increased levels of -OH radicals and may play an important role
in the development of CWP in different coal mining areas.  (Free Radical Biol

ALPHA AMYLASE may be an occupational allergen in the baking industry.  In a
group of 226 bakers and pastry makers and in 88 students of a training school
for bakers, skin sensitivity to the common allergens wheat and alpha amylase
were evaluated.  Findings confirm that bakers are at risk of sensitization not
only to wheat allergen but also to amylase from Aspergillus oryzae.  The
enzyme should be included in the list of substances to be tested among bakers
in whom an occupational allergy is suspected, but particular care should be
taken in evaluating the cutaneous response.  Further investigations are also
needed to identify the source of risk and to better define the characteristics
of the enzyme and the relationship between skin reaction to amylase,
sensitization to wheat, and atopy.  In Italian.  (Med Lav 85(2), 142-148

COTTON-caused ocular and nasal irritation in workers in Lancashire cotton

COTTON-caused ocular and nasal irritation in workers in Lancashire cotton and
synthetic fiber mills was studied.  A cross-sectional study of 1048 cotton
workers and 404 synthetic fiber workers showed that work-related ocular and
nasal irritation are the most common symptoms experienced by cotton textile
workers.  There was no relation between these symptoms and atopy, byssinosis,
or dust concentration.  It is likely that they relate to as yet unidentified
agents unrelated to concentration of cotton dust.  (Occup Environ Med 51(11),
744-748 (1994); Chemical Abstracts 122: 113657t, 1995)

PSC PUBLIC HEARINGS ON WISCONSIN'S ELECTRIC INDUSTRY

The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSC) has prepared
an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) as part of its
investigation into changing the structure and regulation of
the electric utility industry in Wisconsin
(PSC Docket 05-EI-114). This EIS is now available for public
review. A separate report by a special Advisory Committee to
the Commission lists recommendations for changes in electric
generation, transmission and distribution.

The PSC held public information meetings and hearings on
the future of Wisconsin's electric industry in six cities,
November 27 through December 5. The hearings were required in
order to obtain public comment on the EIS, but comments and
testimony were also encouraged on the investigation itself,
including the upcoming Commission Advisory Committee Report.
The Commission decisions (based on the comments and
testimony, EIS, and Advisory Committee Report) may affect
customer electricity costs, customer electric services, and
the choices available for each.

The EIS has been prepared because this investigation could
result in the adoption of principles and policies that
significantly alter the regulatory responsibilities of the
Commission. Changes in how the Commission regulates electric
utilities could, in turn, have environmental and economic
consequences. The EIS explores the economic, environmental and
social costs

The PSC encourages members of the public and organizations to
attend the hearings or write and send comments on the EIS.
Comments and testimony on the EIS must be submitted to the
Public Service Commission offices in Madison by 4:30 p.m. on
Wednesday, December 6, 1995. Comments and testimony will be
considered by the three-member Commission as it determines
what recommendations it will make to the Legislature on
December 12.

For more information, or to request a copy of the
Environmental Impact Statement or the Advisory Committee
Report, please write to the Public Service Commission of
Wisconsin, Electric Division, P.O. Box 7854, Madison, WI,
53707-7854, or call 608/267-2896.

MURPHY OIL SUBSIDIARY AND TEMPLE-INLAND
FOREST PRODUCTS FORM FIBERBOARD COMPANY

Deltic Farm & Timber Co., Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of
Murphy oil Corporation (NYSE:MUR), and Temple-Inland Forest
Products Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Temple-
Inland, Inc. (NYSE:TIN), have formed Del-Tin Fiber, L.L.C.
and plan for the entity to construct and operate a medium
density fiberboard plant at a site near El Dorado, Arkansas.

The plant will cost an estimated $90 million, will have an
annual production capacity of 150 million square feet and will
have more than 100 employees when it begins production in late
1997. The site selection and project design are subject to
regulatory approvals, completion of final engineering and
resolution of other site-related issues. Construction is
scheduled to commence in the summer of 1996.

Del-Tin's Chairman, Ron Pearce, stated, "We are pleased to
announce our selection of the El Dorado/Union County area for
this exciting new venture. We deeply appreciate the efforts of
the El Dorado chamber of Commerce and its local team, city and
county officials, the Arkansas Highway & Transportation
Department and the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission,
all of whom worked together to provide us with a site having
the necessary infrastructure for a project of this magnitude.
Del-Tin looks forward to a long and prosperous future in Union
County."

Medium density fiberboard (MDF) is used as a substitute for
lumber in the furniture, flooring and molding industries
throughout the world. MDF is an engineered wood product
composed of wood residuals (chips, shavings and sawdust) held
together by an adhesive bond. unlike most other lumber
substitutes, MDF possesses many of the same machining and
strength characteristics of solid wood.

INDONESIA'S DURI FIELD PRODUCES BILLIONTH BARREL OF OIL

Indonesia's giant Duri oil field, currently producing at a
record 300,000 barrels daily (b/d), yielded its billionth
barrel in September, Chevron and Texaco reported.

Duri is operated by PT Caltex Pacific Indonesia (CPI), a 50/50
Chevron/Texaco affiliate working under a long-term production
sharing agreement with Pertamina, Indonesia's state oil
company.

Located in Sumatra, Duri was discovered in 1941 and began
producing in 1958. Output peaked at 65,000 b/d in 1963, and
then declined steadily until 1984. At that time, CPI engineers
determined that Duri's large reserves, shallow depth, thick
oil and tight reservoir rocks made it an ideal prospect for
"steamflood" technology, which injects steam to heat the oil
so that more of it flows to the production wells.

In 1985, CPI began a major steamflood at Duri, launching a
new era of production growth. Plans call for continued
expansion of the steamflood, already the world's largest.
Meanwhile, advanced seismic imaging is helping to maximize oil
recovery. Duri currently represents about 40 percent of CPI's
total oil output.

PARACELSIAN FILES PATENT APPLICATION
OF IMPROVED AH-IMMUNOASSAY TECHNOLOGY

Paracelsian, Inc. (NASDAQ: PRLN), of Ithaca, NY, has filed a
U.S. patent application that describes improvements in its Ah-
Immunoassay technology.  Paracelsian anticipates that
enhancements over its currently licensed technology will
provide markets for the assay in Asia and Eastern Europe.

"The simplicity and speed of the new formats are ideal for
countries with enormous environmental problems and little
financial support for high-cost instrumental analysis," said
inventor Geoffrey Wheelock, Ph. D., Director of Analytical
Research at Paracelsian. "Much of Asia and Eastern Europe are
rebounding from decades of environmental neglect."

Ah-Immunoassay technology is a biologically-based diagnostic
test designed to detect and determine the level of dioxin-like
compounds found in the environment. The disclosure filed at
the U.S. Patent and Trademarks Office in Washington, D.C.
describes methods for increasing sensitivity, reducing
background interference, increasing sample throughput,
reducing the time required to perform the assay, and reducing
reagent use.

Paracelsian is a biotechnology company engaged in the
discovery of pharmaceuticals and the development and marketing
of assays for Unproved cancer diagnosis. The Company's
technologies are based on a biochemical process known as
signal transduction -- a form of information processing within
the cell. The Company has in effect several licensing deals,
including an agreement with Dow Chemical for Paracelsian's
Ah-Immunoassay signed in January 1995.

EPA APPROVES MONSANTO'S INSECT-PROTECTED COTTON

The EPA has granted regulatory approval for Monsanto's
Bollgard(TM) gene, which provides cotton plants with season-long,
in-plant protection from such major lepidopteran insect pests as
the cotton bollworm, tobacco budworm and pink bollworm. EPA's
registration of the Bollgard gene, the first insect-protection
gene to be approved for cotton and only the third for any crop,
follows the successful completion earlier this year of regulatory
reviews by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA). The notification marks
Monsanto's fourth allowing full commercialization of a
genetically engineered crop in the past six months.

The insect control protein introduced into cotton plants was
originally isolated from a specific strain of a natural soil
bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis. The genetically-engineered
seeds containing the Bollgard gene are covered by Monsanto
patents, some of which have been issued, while others are
pending.

According to James Tobin, Monsanto Cotton Business Director, the
Bollgard gene will be widely available to America's cotton
farmers for the 1996 planting season. The gene has already been
incorporated into a number of popular cotton varieties.

The technology will be commercially introduced by Delta and
Pine Land Company, the leading U.S. cotton seed company.
Additional programs to commercialize Bollgard cotton are
underway at the Jacob Hartz Seed Company and Stoneville
Pedigreed Seed Company, Inc.

CHIRON AWARDS CONTRACT TO SEPRAGEN
FOR LARGE-SCALE PURIFICATION SYSTEMS

Sepragen Corporation (NASDAQ: SPGNU, SPGNZ, SPGNA, SPGNW), of
San Leandro, CA, has signed a contract to build multiple
QuantaSep LS (large-scale) systems for Chiron Corporation. The
contract, valued at approximately $400,000, includes hardware,
software, documentation and validation. The systems have been
designed to meet the specific needs of Chiron's drug
manufacturing efforts.  Delivery is scheduled for January
1996.

"The interactive team efforts between Sepragen and Chiron
engineers resulted in the custom design of the process
purification systems. These will enable the rapid purification
of large quantities of two new potential Chiron drugs for
their clinical trial needs," said Vinit Saxena, president and
chairman.

"This is part of our overall strategic plan to provide
state-of-the-art, large-scale purification systems to
biopharmaceutical companies to enhance and optimize their
manufacturing processes.

"We selected Sepragen for this purchase based on the
exceptional service that they have provided to us in the
past," said Mark Pemberton, director of Bulk Pharmaceutical
Manufacturing at Chiron Corporation.

The QuantaSep LS is a large-scale, computer-controlled
chromatography workstation consisting of hardware,
electronics, software, sensors and detectors.

"Sepragen's advanced technologies have added significant
economic value to the manufacturing processes of many FDA
approved pharmaceutical drugs worldwide," Saxena said.

Sepragen Corporation is a pioneer in the field of large-scale
chromatography - the next generation technology in the
separations field. The company markets a patented radial flow
chromatography (RFC) technology that utilizes a novel
hydrodynamic column design in which the flow is directed
radially from the outside to the center of the column. The
surface areas are larger and the radial flow path (bed depth)
is shorter. The combination of these features results in
higher flow rates, lower back pressures, and increased
volumetric productivity over traditional axial columns. This
is further magnified in large-volume chromatography
applications.

Sepragen also markets computer-controlled process
chromatography workstations and process technology to the
biotechnology, food and environmental industries. The
company's products are being used by leading biotech
companies to reduce manufacturing costs and commercial
production time to market, as well as by food and
environmental companies to produce new value-added products
and processes. Based in San Leandro, California, the company
markets its proprietary RFC technology and services worldwide.

CPUC IS WATCHFUL REGARDING RF/EMF FROM CELLULAR TOWERS

The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) today
ordered cellular utilities to identify and address public
concerns- potential health problems from electromagnetic field
(ENF) and radio-frequency (RF) exposure in siting and building
new cellular towers. It urged cellular companies to site
facilities away from schools and hospitals, and to restrict
access to sites with warning signs and barriers.

The Commission's jurisdiction is limited to cellular towers
and related facilities - it does not regulate cellular phones.
The federal Food and Drug Administration regulates RF
emissions from consumer/industrial devices and is looking into
RF emissions from hand-held cellular phones.

Due to public concern and scientific uncertainty regarding the
potential health effects of EMF exposure, the Commission
examined what steps should be taken to mitigate the-health
effects, if any, of RF and EMFs from the 1,000 cellular
facilities in California. It found no scientific link between
EMFs and adverse health effects on humans from cellular
facilities.

A steering committee composed of one representative each from
the CPUC Commission Advisory and Compliance Division, CPUC
Division of Ratepayer Advocates, state Department of Health
Services, Cellular Carriers Association of California, and
citizens concerned About Telecommunications EMF held an EMF
informational workshop on July 21, 1993 for interested
individuals and organizations. The workshop was videotaped for
those who could not attend.

APHIS GEARING UP TO EVALUATE TRANSGENIC INSECT RELEASES

Now that the first application to field test a genetically
engineered insect has been submitted to USDA/APHIS, a
Transgenic Arthropod Team has been formed in the Biotechnology
Permits Unit of Biotechnology, Biologics, and Environmental
Protection (BBEP), the agency that oversees introductions of
transgenic organisms and products for USDA. The Team will be
responsible for the development of guidance for the release of
genetically modified arthropods into the environment, and the
preparation of environmental documents associated with those
releases.

APHIS/BBEP already provides this sort of guidance to
prospective applicants seeking to field test genetically
engineered plants and microorganisms under permit or
notification. The agency distributes USDA-APHIS Technical
Bulletin 1783, "User's Guide for Introducing Genetically
Engineered Plants and Microorganisms" to help investigators
identify potential risks to the environment, and advises
applicants concerning the data that must be available for
agency review.

With more insect release proposals expected, the Transgenic
Arthropod Team is compiling a Bibliography Associated With the
Introduction of Transgenic Arthropods, which is publicly
available in database format. It currently contains 32 general
citations and reviews, 32 references on field evaluations,
and 58 titles on laboratory methods. The Team will continue
adding relevant publications and expand the database, and
encourages others to suggest additional publications that
should be included. In addition to the bibliography, the
following information on how proposed releases will be
reviewed is available on the BBEP homepage
(http://www.aphis.usda.gov/bbep/bp).

The evaluation process first considers what the risks would
be if the introduced organism was not transgenic. The analysis
at this point would be the same as for the introduction of a
classical biological control organism and would require such
information as: (1) phylogenetic position of the organism and
characteristics of near relatives, (2) geographic origin and
range, to include temperature and relative humidity tolerances
and diapause attributes, (3) host and habitat preferences, (4)
dispersal characteristics, (5) life table attributes, (6)
interactions with other species, and (7) the relationship
between the organism and currently employed pest management
strategies.

The evaluation process would next consider whether the genetic
alterations have altered the risks associated with the
unmodified organism. The fundamental risk assessment issue to
be addressed is: Will the genetic alteration modify
ecologically or environmentally relevant properties of the
organism? To properly address this issue, APHIS would need to
consider such information as: (1) how the recipient organism
was transformed through recombinant DNA technology, to include
characteristics of the donor, vector, and recipient organisms
and a description of the methods employed, (2) the
characteristics of the modified organism, to include the
stability of the new genotype and the probability of gene
transfer to other organisms, (3) potential impact of the
transgenic arthropod on native populations, communities, and
ecosystems, and (4) methods for evaluation of the safety of
the transgenic organism in field trials before unrestricted
release.

In summary, the APHIS evaluation process would basically
consider the attributes of the unmodified organism, the
attributes of the genetic alteration, the phenotype of the
modified organism compared to the unmodified organism, and the
attributes of the accessible environment. Only after
sufficient information is provided in these four areas of
concern will APHIS be able to determine the appropriateness of
a release into the environment.

APHIS welcomes comments at any time concerning the present and
future regulation of transgenic arthropods. These comments
can be directed to Dr. Orrey P. Young at oyoung@aphis.usda.gov
or at 301-734-8565 (voice) or 301-734-5992 (fax)

INDUSTRY, GOVERNMENT REPS SPAR WITH ENVIROS OVER WASTE-ENERGY MORATORIUM

   At the latest round of Senate hearings over Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act reauthorization, representatives of industry and local
government officials strongly opposed a proposal by the environmental group
Clean Water Action that there be a moratorium on the construction of new
waste-to-energy plants until the year 2000, and that incinerator ash be
managed as a hazardous waste.
   The moratorium and incinerator ash proposals have been endorsed by a
broad coalition of national environmental groups, and legislation to
achieve those goals introduced by Rep. Peter Kostmayer (D-Pa.) has won the
endorsement of 24 House co-sponsors. However, the main Senate RCRA bill,
S. 976, sponsored by Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) contains no such provisions,
and Baucus' skeptical questioning last week of the Clean Water Action
representative suggested that it is unlikely to be amended to do so.
   Dr. Henry Cole, director of science and policy for Clean Water Action,
argued that the moratorium was needed in part to confront the ''mercury
crisis in this country.'' As well, he said, waste-to-energy competes
directly with recycling for materials, and for scarce capital.
   Asked Baucus: ''Why would a moratorium be necessary if the Clean Air
Act (mercury emissions) reduction provisions'' were implemented and
enforced as called for under that law? Cole replied that he did not have
confidence EPA would effectively implement the provisions, and that,
anyway, this was not his sole reason for supporting a moratorium.
   Under questioning from Baucus, Randall Franke, representing the National
Association of Counties, the National League of Cities, and the Solid Waste
Association of North America, stated this his groups ''are equally adamant
and opposed'' to a moratorium on waste-to-energy, and the designation of
incinerator ash as hazardous. Said Franke: ''We need more options (for
solid waste management), not less.''
   AllenMoore, president of the National Solid Wastes Management
Association, said that while there had been ''temporary disruptions'' at a
few waste-to-energy facilities due to materials diversion caused by
recycling, in general there was no conflict between resource recovery and
recycling. ''You can accommodate any level of recycling,'' said Moore, as
long as waste-to-energy plants are built at the outset as part of an
integrated waste management solution.
   In his testimony, Paul Varello, deputy chair of NSWMA's Institute of
Resource Recovery, said that several recent field tests ''make clear that
municipal waste combustor ash is not a 'hazardous waste.' '' Based on
findings that incinerator ash disposed in a landfill meeting the relevant
technical standards ''presents no significant risk to human health and the
environment,'' Varello said that several provisions in S. 976 ''could be
improved.''
   Added Varello: ''Specifically, several provisions in S. 976 would
impose more stringent requirements on landfills where ash and municipal
solid waste is disposed than for landfills where only municipal solid waste
is disposed. These provisions reflect the old view that the disposal of
combined ash (bottom and fly ash) from waste combustors presents a greater
threat to human health and the environment than the disposal of municipal
solid waste. A series of recent studies suggest otherwise.''

EPA'S NEW LANDFILL REGS APPLAUDED BY NSWMA, CRITICIZED BY ENVIROS

   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's issuance September 11 of the
first comprehensive federal Subtitle-D municipal landfill standards should
''bolster confidence in landfilling'' and ''help level the playing field,''
EPA Administrator William K. Reilly said last week.
   The regs were generally applauded by industry for providing
environmental safeguards that will facilitate the construction of needed
new landfills. At the same time, the regs drew fire for their
''loopholes'' from environmentalists, whose recent lawsuit finally forced
EPA to issue the long-delayed regs when it did.
   The EPA regs, issued under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act,
include location, facility design and operation, groundwater monitoring,
financial responsibility, and closure requirements, in addition to cleanup
requirements for existing contamination. They are generally to take effect
24 months from publication in the Federal Register, with the exception that
ground-water monitoring and corrective action requirements are phased-in,
allowing up to five years for compliance.
   Under law, states will be required to incorporate the EPA standards into
their current state permitting programs. EPA approval of the state program
is then required, with the Agency retaining the authority to enforce its
standards in cases where a state program is not approved.
   In states with EPA-approved permitting programs, landfills must be
designed to ensure drinking water standards are not exceeded in
groundwater. States without EPA-approved programs are required to have
landfills designed with a composite liner made of synthetic material
covering a two-foot clay liner.
   At the same time, the regs provide states with approved program
flexibility to alter landfill requirements ''to accommodate the wide
variety of local conditions that exist around landfills,'' said EPA. Under
certain conditions, states with EPA-approved programs can approve
alternative landfill designs, allow use of alternative daily cover
materials, or modify the rule's 30-year post-closure care period.
   While this approach was cited by Reilly as an example of the Agency
having ''worked hard'' to reduce burdens that the rules might place on
communities, this flexibility was criticized by the Sierra Club for
enabling states to enact ''potentially weaker'' landfill and groundwater
monitoring standards. This, said the Sierra Club's Daniel Weiss, would
allow ''some landfills to evade strict groundwater protection requirements
which perpetuates the threat of drinking water contamination across the
nation."
   The Sierra Club also faulted the regs for not requiring leak detection
systems which would detect leaks before they contaminated groundwater, and
called on Congress to plug this and other loopholes.
   Allen Moore, president of the National Solid Wastes Management
Association, noted that the waste services industry ''has anxiously
awaited'' the EPA regs ''because they enumerate the measures being taken by
our industry to protect the environment and to assure public health and
safety in the land disposal of our nation's wastes.''
   Added Moore: ''Hopefully, these new regulations will be a catalyst for
eliminating the backlog that exists in some states where permitting and
siting of new disposal facilities have been halted due to a lack of federal
environmental protection standards. Now, using these new rules as a
building block, these stalled projects can proceed and we can begin siting
and developing the capacity to meet our future waste disposal needs.''
   Among other standards included in the EPA regs:
   -- Location requirements restrict the siting of new landfills near
airports and in ecologically valuable wetlands or areas subject to natural
disasters such as floodplains, fault areas and seismic zones.
   -- Operation standards include daily cover, methane gas monitoring,
stormwater controls, and programs to keep regulated hazardous waste out of
landfills.
   -- Closure and post-closure care include placing a final cover over the
landfill, final cover maintennace, groundwater and methane gas monitoring,
and leachate management for 30 years.

BFI STOCK FALLS AFTER COMPANY LOWERS 4TH-QUARTER EARNINGS PROJECTION

   Not even the publication of RCRA Subtitle-D regulations by the
Environmental Protection Agency helped stop the fall of Browning-Ferris
Industries stock, which fell nearly six points in the 10 days following the
company's prediction of lower fourth-quarter earnings.
   BFI filed an 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission Sept. 3,
estimating that its fourth-quarter earnings would be 15%-25% less than its
third-quarter earnings. Earlier the company had predicted a 10%-15% drop
over the previous quarter. Net income of 28-32 cents per share is expected
for the fourth quarter, which ends Sept. 30, down from 38 cents for the
third quarter. The company also estimates income from operations for fiscal
1991 will be 12%-15% lower than the $257 million reported for 1990.
   BFI stock dropped four points to 21-3/4 after the 8-K was filed, and had
fallen another 1-7/8 by Sept. 12, the day after Subtitle D was published.
   In the 8-K report, BFI blamed lower revenues both in the third and
fourth quarters on lower commercial waste volumes as a result of the
recession, as well as state waste minimization requirements and the
diversion of a portion of the waste stream from the company's higher margin
collections and landfill operations to the lower margin recycling
business.
   Fletcher Thorne-Thomsen, BFI's vice president for investor relations,
said the company is disappointed with the results, but he would not predict
when the company would come out of the slump, nor would he name the
number-one cause of the company's economic troubles.
   A former BFI official said that in addition to the recession a major
cause of the firm's economic problems is poor management. ''The company is
just in turmoil right now,'' he said. ''Sure business is down, but it's
still solid; and saying recycling has hurt is crazy because it saves air
space, and that air space will be worth more next year than it is today.''
   Other industry observersagree that the company has a management problem.
One analyst pointed out that, while other waste management firms are
having some financial troubles because of the recession, they are not
nearly as bad as BFI has experienced.
   However, at least one Wall Street firm--Smith Barney--has some positive
words. Analyst Ken Leung is advising his clients to buy because, ''The
stock is cheap and we think it has bottomed out.''
   Leung says BFI will clearly benefit in the long run from the new
Subtitle-D regulations, which he predicts will reduce the 6,000 existing
solid waste landfills to 2,000. He adds, however, that in the near term the
new rules may put downward pressure on disposal prices, as small landfill
owners scurry to fill existing facilities that can not meet the new
requirements.
   In other BFI news, on Sept. 4 the company declared a regular quarterly
cash dividend of 17 cents per common share of stock, payable Oct. 4. At the
same time, it announced that Frank W. Montfort would fill the newly created
office of vice president, chief quality officer. Montfort had been
divisional vice president, operations.

DELAWARE AUTHORITY PICKS ABB RESOURCE RECOVERY FOR WASTE-ENERGY PLANT

   The Delaware Solid Waste Authority Board has selected ABB (Asea Brown
Boveri) Resource Recovery Systems to start negotiations for the design,
construction and operation of a 500-ton/day waste-to-energy plant.
   The mass-burn facility will allow the authority to manage solid waste
generated as the result of future increased growth in Sussex County, said
the authority. The amount of the contract was not made public.
   ABB and two other companies, Foster Wheeler Power Systems and
Westinghouse Electric Corporation submitted ''excellent proposals for the
project,'' said an authority spokesman. The authority's staff, consultants
and board members conducted exhaustive evaluations of the three proposals,
he said.
   The general view was that any one of the three companies would do a good
job, he continued. Cleanliness of operations, technical capability,
operating experience, guarantees, economic, and financial strengths were
considerations in the selection process, said the official.
   ''ABB is a multi-national company with revenues of $27-billion and about
215,000 employees. ABB brings together the best of American, Swedish,
Swiss and German technology in a worldwide high technology company,'' said
the authority official. ABB acquired the U.S. firm of
Combustion-Engineering, Inc., a Delaware corporation. The authority
believes that ABB can provide Delaware with a state-of-the-art and
environmentally sound waste-to-energy facility, he said.
   The plant will be located at the authority's Southern Solid Waste
Management Center at Jones Crossroads, Sussex County, Delaware. Front-end
separation of materials will be accomplished through the ''Recycle
Delaware'' program, said the official. In addition, space will be
allocated for additional front-end separation in the Southern Reclamation
Plant if it becomes necessary in the future.
   The Southern Reclamation Plant will not only reduce material being
landfilled, but will also give the authority the opportunity to recycle
existing landfill space in the future. Timely completion of the plant will
be essential for assuring safe solid-waste disposal capacity in Sussex
County for several decades, said the official.
   The plant will have the best available control technology, which
includes the scrubbing of acid gases and a baghouse to remove fine
particulates. The authority will dispose of the ash from the
waste-to-energy plant in its Southern Solid Waste Management Center
landfill. With state and federal assistance and approval, the authority
will explore constructive uses for ash in order to minimize ash disposal in
the landfill, said the official.
   The waste-to-energy plant will generate approximately 15-megawatts of
electricity, according to officials at ABB, headquartered in Windsor,
Connecticut. Contract and price negotiations are expected to begin in
September and construction could begin as early as the fourth quarter of
1992. The plant will feature ABB's state-of-the-art environmental
controls, which have been subjected to rigorous testing by the U.S.
Department of Environmental Protection and its Canadian counterpart,
Environment Canada, said the official. The new facility will feature the
Combustion Engineering DeBartolomeis mass-burn grate system, proven in 79
plants around the world for 35 years, an ABB Combustion Engineering Systems
steam generator, and other ABB-manufactured products and systems.
   ''In today's market, winning this project against two quality
competitors is a significant accomplishment,'' said the ABB official.
''The Southern Reclamation Project will strengthen our company's position
in the North American waste to-energy market and enhance our stature as a
major full-service vendor.''
   ABB Resource Recovery Systems designs, builds and operates both
mass-burn and processed fuel waste-to-energy plants, including operational
facilities in Hartford, Detroit and Honolulu, and several projects
currently under development.

MIFA CLOSES $342-MILLION REFINANCING FOR SEMASS ROCHESTER EXPANSION

   The Massachusetts Industrial Finance Agency (MIFA), Semass and
underwriters closed a $342-million refinancing and facilities expansion
bond issue for the shred and burn Semass Resource Recovery Facility in
Rochester, Massachusetts, said a project official.
   The Semass facility is a 52-megawatt shred and burn, waste-to-energy
resource recovery plant with a capacity of 1,900-tons of solid waste per
day. It is the largest facility of the three of its type in operation,
according to the official.
   The expansion would increase total electrical output of the plant to
78-megawatts and the waste acceptance capacity by about 900-tons/day to
2,800-tons/day. The expansion is slated to be on line by the end of 1993.
   Semass is still working on building permits and obtaining a review of
the plans by the Department of Environmental Protection. It is expected
that some work on the expansion can begin this fall, he said.
   The sources of revenue to repay principal and interest on the bonds are
waste disposal fees to be derived from waste disposal contracts with
municipalities and private sources, as well as income from the solid-waste
spot market, said the official.
   Other sources of revenue will be derived from the sale of electricity to
Commonwealth Electric Company, the sale of ferrous and non-ferrous
recyclables and interest earned on funds and accounts as defined by the
indenture.
   The principal security for the bonds includes a mortgage on the Semass
plant as well as a leasehold mortgage on a transfer station in Braintree,
Massachusetts. Prudential Securities was the lead underwriter and
placement agent for the issue, which consisted of $255.6-million of
tax-exempt, 24-year bonds, $61.6-million of taxable bonds and $25-million
in taxable subordinated notes.
   Greenwich Partners, Inc. of Greenwich, Connecticut, was underwriter and
placement agent for the tax-exempt bonds, and Stephens Inc. of Little Rock,
Arkansas, was underwriter and placement agent for the taxable portion of
the issue.
   The major portion of the financing consisted of $145.6-million non-
alternate minimum tax (AMT) and $110-million AMT tax-exempt revenue bonds.
The non-AMT bonds were priced at par to yield 9%. The AMT bonds were
priced at par to yield 9.25%.
   The $61.6-million of taxable bonds are priced at par to yield 11.25%;
the subordinated notes were priced at par to yield 13.2%. The major
portion of the tax-exempt bonds were purchased by bond funds, according to
Greenwich Partners. The Semass bond issue will refund $178.6-million of
outstanding debt and provide approximately $160-million of the expansion of
the existing Semass plant.
   The principal security for the bonds includes a mortgage on the Semass
plant as well as a leasehold mortgage on a transfer station in Braintree,
Massachusetts. There is also a debt service reserve fund consisting of
approximately one year's maximum debt service.
   The existing Semass facility currently has operating contracts with 31
municipalities, one regional waste disposal district, Otis Air National
Guard Base and a commercial waste hauler.
   The Semass facility in Rochester, Massachusetts, went into commercial
operation in 1989. The shred and burn technology is based on the principle
of shredding municipal solid waste and magnetically removing a large
percentage of the ferrous metals.
   Shredding solid waste to a uniform six-inch size enhances the fuel value
so that a ton of processed refuse fuel has the equivalent heating value of
72-gallons of fuel oil. The fuel is fed to boilers where it burns
primarily in suspension creating heat and producing steam to generate
electricity, he said. The process includes clean-up systems for
removing pollutants from boiler exhaust gases. A bottom ash processing
system recovers ferrous and non-ferrous metals and converts the residual
into a usable aggregate product.
   The fly ash is stabilized to form a non-toxic, non-hazardous mortar
which is then landfilled and does not pose a threat to the environment,
continued the official. Potential uses for the Semass boiler aggregate
include cinder blocks for construction and as a gravel substitute for road
bases.
   The patented flyash stabilization system ensures that no hazardous or
toxic material from the facility leaves the site, they said. Other
facilities using the process have operated in Albany, New York, since 1981,
and Hamilton, Ontario, since 1972.
   During the 12-month period ending July, 1991, the existing plant
operated at the industry standard of approximately 85% of capacity and is
expected to continue at this rate. In the first year after completion, the
expansion facility is expected to operate at 80% of capacity and to reach
the 85% level thereafter, said the Semass official.
   The Semass facility has, since it first began accepting waste in 1988,
processed 1,250,000-tons of solid waste, and produced over 700,000-megawatt
hours of electricity, enough to service over 50,000 houses in southeastern
Massachusetts.
   It has recovered over 117-million pounds of metal, enough to build at
least 58,000 new cars, said the official. About 5% of the waste is
recovered as recyclable metals which are marketed. These metals contribute
a ''small percentage'' to the overall profits of the plant, he elaborated.
''But we look at it as a source of revenue plus the avoided cost of
landfilling,'' he explained. It also contributes to the recycling goals of
the regions, according to the official.
   The facility has produced approximately 97,000-tons of boiler aggregate
from bottom ash; and enough gravel substitute to produce over 6-million
concrete blocks. Semass is currently reviewing tests with the Department
of Environmental Protection. ''We're very confident the aggregate will be
found suitable for use in construction of the expansion, and that we'll be
able to market it in the future,'' the project official added.
   Semass is a private, for-profit entity owned by subsidiaries of Energy
Answers Corporation of Albany, New York, Bechtel Group Inc., Stephens
Holding Company and ESI Energy, Inc., an affiliate of Florida Power and
Light Company.

MECKLENBURG COUNTY, N.C., TO ISSUE RFP FOR 600 T/D MASS-BURN PLANT

   Officials in Mecklenburg County, N.C. plan to issue a request for
proposals on October 1 for a 600-ton/day, mass-burn incinerator to be built
at an industrial park south of Charlotte.
   The county is seeking a turnkey contractor that will design, construct
and operate the waste-to-energy plant, said Charles G. Horne, project
manager at the county's engineering department.
   The $80-million facility, which will be built at the Arrowood Industrial
Park, will generate steam for a General Tire factory and as much as 12.5 mw
of electricity for Duke Power, the local utility (Integrated Waste
Management, 20 March, 3).
   Horne told Integrated Waste Management that responses will be due Jan.
30, and that the county will select the winning proposal by the end of
March. Construction of the plant is likely to begin in the second half of
1993, with completion of the incinerator to follow in late 1995 or early
1996.
   Mecklenburg County's first waste-to-energy plant--a two-year-old,
235-t/d facility at the campus of the University of North
Carolina-Charlotte--was designed and built by MK Ferguson of Cleveland,
which also operates the incinerator for the county.
   Horne said that parties interested in receiving information about the
upcoming RFP should call 704-336-6178.

EPA SEEKS COMMENTS ON USED OIL OPTIONS; STRESSES SUPPORT FOR RECYCLING

   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last week sought public comment
on a wide range of options for the listing and management of used oil. In
issuing what an Agency official termed a ''neutral'' proposal--which
included one option that would list used oil as a hazardous waste--EPA
officials reiterated their interest in promoting used oil recycling in an
environmentally safe manner.
   In providing a 45-day public comment period, Agency officials said this
would be followed by issuance of final EPA rules in May, 1992. At the same
time, EPA officials noted that used oil recycling is also being taken up by
Congress as part of its reauthorization of the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act. Agency officials said they expected last week's proposal
''would become part of a dialogue with Congress''--the consequences of
which are still difficult to predict.
   Last week's proposal expands upon a 1985 Agency initiative that proposed
to list used oil as a hazardous waste. The Agency noted again last week
that it had backed away from that proposal as a result of public comments
which ''convinced the (A)gency that listing used oil as a hazardous waste
would severely cripple the recycling industry.''
   A successful lawsuit challenging this inaction, brought by the Natural
Resources Defense Council and others, concluded with the court ruling that
EPA was required to make a listing determination for used oil based on the
statutory criteria for listing, which relates to whether a material is
toxic or not.
   In addition to its option to list all used oil as hazardous, a second
option would list as hazardous ''only those categories of used oil that are
typically and frequently hazardous based on their toxicity at the point of
generation, rather than after collection and likely contamination.'' The
Agency said oils that may be listed under this option are those from
gasoline-powered engines, including used oils from automotive crankcases,
marine engines, and piston-engine airplanes.
   A third option would be not to list any used oils as hazardous, and
instead rely on management standards ''to address the types of
mismanagement that have historically occurred with used oil, such as
contamination with hazardous waste due to mixing, road oiling, releases,
and spills associated with storage and transportation.'' Should this
option be adopted, the Agency said used oil handlers would still be
required to test oil destined for disposal for hazardous characteristics,
and then manage it accordingly.
   The Agency stated its belief that used oils pose hazards to human health
and the environment, ''and therefore need to be managed safely.'' The
latest proposal contemplates a ''phased-in'' two-stage approach to
management standards, which would include the following options:
   --''Provide management standards for all used oils to some extent.''
   --''Provide one set of management requirements for all used oil
handlers.''
   --''Provide basic management standards immediately that balance the
interests of protective regulation and the need to promote recycling.''
   The Agency proposed that the Phase-1 requirements ''would be fairly
simple 'good housekeeping' practices that address the improper storage and
disposal of used oil by generators, transporters, recyclers, and disposal
facilities.'' It added that ''good housekeeping'' would include such
practices as ''inspecting for leaks, releases, or spills; maintaining
storage tanks and containers; and tracking recycled used oil from
generators to recyclers.''
   This Phase I would also ban road oiling and establish guidelines that
presume that ''all used oil being disposed is destined for recycling.''
Phase II under this approach would involve possible additional management
standards and controls for used oil, if needed.
   The EPA proposal also considers possible incentives for promoting the
collection and recycling of used oil generated by people who change thier
own oil, the so-called ''do-it-yourselfers.''

DENVER SELECTS CAMP DRESSER & MCKEE TO STUDY LOWRY LANDFILL SITE

   The city and county of Denver as well as the Denver Metro Wastewater
Reclamation District have selected Camp Dresser & McKee to perform a
remedial investigation/feasibility study and treatability study of the
Lowry Landfill, located in Arapahoe County, Colo., said a company
spokeswoman. The contract is valued at $1.6 million and completion of work
is slated for March, 1993, she said.
   The landfill accepted industrial and municipal wastes from 1967 to 1980,
is listed on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Priorities
List and will be cleaned up through Superfund, she said. Under the
contract, Cambridge, Mass.-based Camp Dresser & McKee will evaluate the
nature and extent of contamination and evaluate remedial alternatives for
the soils and surface water and sediments media, she explained.

WHEELABRATOR, REF-FUEL AND ENERGY ANSWERS REVISE GREEN ISLAND PLANS

   Wheelabrator Technologies, American Ref-Fuel and Energy Answers Corp.
have all submitted revised proposals to build a 1,500-ton/day
waste-to-enegy plant in the Village of Green Island, New York, according to
John Brown, spokesman for the Green Island Solid Waste Advisory Committee.
   The town last month had sent letters to the firms allowing them to
submit additions or amendments to their initial plans for the venture
(Integrated Waste Management, 21 Aug., 1).
   Jack Risteau, project manager for Wheelabrator Corp., said the company
has added a shopping center to its proposal. ''We've added working with
Heritage Development Company of Syracuse to build a retail center which
could generate as much as $12 million a year for the village,'' he said.
''We've interested them (Heritage Development Company) enough that they've
entered into a working agreement with us, but we're in the early stage.''
   Risteau said both Wheelabrator Corp. and Heritage Development Company
are doing market studies and other analyses to determine the value of a
shopping center for the village. ''They (Green Island) don't have any
malls. It would be a real benefit for them. It would be about 300,000
square feet, and employ 750 people,'' he said. He said the mall would be
located north of Green Island's electric substation.
   Energy Answers Corp. has added new air pollution control equipment, and
upgraded the waste processing facility by adding a 500-ton/day construction
and demolition debris recycling facility and a paper recycling mill to its
proposal, according to Thomas Julien, Project Manager for Answers. Julien
said the company's unsure as to how much the entire package will cost
because the sizes of the facilities have not been determined. However, it
is expected that Energy Answers Corp. will generate between $3- and $4
million annually in payments to the village.
   Finally, American Ref-Fuel has proposed in its revision three different
projects to complement the waste-to-energy and recycling facilities
featured in its original plan. According to J. Kevin Cmunt, Project
Development Manager for American Ref-Fuel, one option is building a Kraft
Market Pulp Mill, which would produce uncoated freesheet, coated
groundwood, coated freesheet, uncoated groundwood and bristol at a rate of
600 t/d. This includes stationery, tablets, and copier paper.
   American Ref-Fuel also proposed a 100% recycled newsprint mill or a
linerboard facility. According to Cmunt, six leading paper manufacturing
companies have expressed interest in the projects. He added an addition of
a paper recycling project would result in benefits of $8,475,000 to
$10,850,000 to the Village of Green Island per year.

KEEP AMERICA BEAUTIFUL (KAB) LAUNCHES SOLID WASTE WORKSHOP SERIES in

KEEP AMERICA BEAUTIFUL (KAB) LAUNCHES SOLID WASTE WORKSHOP SERIES in
Phoenix, Arizona on September 27. The newly-designed community workshops
are intended to educate citizens and public officials about solid waste
handling practices, according to an official of the Stamford,
Connecticut-based non-profit group.
   Future solid waste workshops will be scheduled around the country. ''The
new series will continue KAB's efforts to counter our growing dependence on
a declining number of landfills, the increasing amount of trash produced
each year, and the inability of communities to site new disposal
facilities,'' said the official.
   ''Our goal,'' he concluded, ''is to accelerate the training of concerned
local citizens and public officials to prepare them to assume greater roles
in planning and implementing solid waste management programs at the
community level.'' KAB is a national public education organization
dedicated to improving waste handling practices in 460 certified affiliated
communities in 40 states, including 19 official, state-affiliated
organizations.

SWANA RFQ DRAWS 49 PROSPECTIVE CONTRACTORS FOR EPA'S MITE PROGRAM

   The Solid Waste Association of North America (SWANA) has received 49
responses to its request for qualifications (RFQ) from companies,
universities and laboratories seeking to be subcontractors to perform
evaluations under the Environmental Protection Agency's Municipal Solid
Waste Innovative Technology Evaluation (MITE) program.
   SWANA and the EPA recently entered into a three-year cooperative
agreement in which the association is assisting the agency in implementing
the evaluation program (Integrated Waste Management, 29 May, 2). EPA
established the program a year ago to ''help developers address barriers to
commercialization by providing objective, independent, third-party
evaluations of selected technologies,'' said a SWANA official.
   Information produced by the program will be used not only by technology
developers but by local governments that are responsible for day-to-day
management of municipal solid wastes, the official said.
   EPA's evaluation program in the first year included solidification and
stabilization of municipal waste combustion ash residues. Second year
activities are being directed at evaluating other strategies for managing
municipal solid wastes, such as recycling, landfilling, combustion and
materials processing.
   A SWANA spokesperson said the association had not yet established the
schedule for deciding on the RFQs and further evaluations.

MID-AMERICA WASTE SEEN MAINTAINING 25%-30% ANNUAL EARNINGS GROWTH

   Mid-American Waste Systems Inc., which is one of the fastest growing and
most profitable solid waste companies n the U.S., should maintain annual
earnings growth of 25% to 30%, according to a report prepared by Stephen
Schweich, research analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons, Baltimore, Maryland.
   Mid-American revenues are growing at a better than 30% annual rate and
operating margins exceed 25%, he continued. Solid waste management is a
$28-billion per year industry in the U.S., and ''we believe Mid-American
can reach $300-million to $400-million in revenues by 1995 while
maintaining its current profit margins,'' said the report.
   The firm, based in Canal Winchester, Ohio, has extensive landfill
resources, well-managed transfer stations and collection operations,
growing special waste businesses, and experienced management, according to
Schweich. It has 17 operating landfills, 9 transfer stations and 8
collection companies.
   Its principal areas of geographic focus include Ohio, Indiana,
Pennsylvania, Illinois and West Virginia. New landfill sites are under
development in Florida, South Carolina, California and Colorado. In the
1986 to 1989 period, Mid-American's revenues grew from $4-million to
$48-million, and net income increased tenfold.
   The company's rapid geographic expansion came primarily from
acquisitions of 10 landfills and numerous waste collection companies in
Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky and Pennsylvania. Mid-American's basic acquisition
philosophy has been to buy companies cheaply, bring in professional
management, exploit synergies with other Mid-American operations, and
ultimately build critical mass and profitability, explained the analysis.
   During the past two years, Mid-American has added other territories to
its operations base including West Virginia, Georgia and Colorado.
Moreover, the company is pursing ''greenfield'' landfill projects in
California and Florida, elaborated the report.
   According to Alex. Brown estimates, the total North American solid waste
industry was about $28-billion in 1990. Municipalities and independent
operators control roughly 71% of the market. Waste Management handles 14.3%
of the waste, Browning-Ferris controls 8.9%, and Laidlaw 2.7%.
   Of the 3.4% of the waste handled by emerging players--representing
$950-million in 1990--Attwoods earned $338-million. Chambers Development
garnered $214-million, and Western Waste $190-milion. Mid-American
achieved revenues of $79-million, American Waste $61-million, Sanifill
$39-million. Republic Waste had revenues of $18-million, and Integrated
Waste, $12-million.

***************
SLANTS & TRENDS
***************


WHISTLEBLOWER UPDATE:  A Labor Department judge is slated to
hear arguments Jan. 31 on whether to grant whistleblower
status to a former employee of a sharps container
manufacturer who complained about the integrity of products
being shipped (MWN, Dec. 12, p. 206). In that case, DOL
Administrative Law Judge Samuel Smith ruled for the first
time the federal Environmental Protection Agency could
regulate sharps collectors under the Toxic Substances
Control Act .

THE LONG-AWAITED RULING could spell relief for whistleblower
Steve Balog. Dottie Balog, his wife, said she hoped the
government's budget problems would not interfere with the
Jan. 31 court trial. Much is riding on the decision. If
Steve Balog is granted whistleblower protection, then his
employer, Med-Safe Systems, would be barred from suing him.
Also, Balog could be eligible for back pay, legal fees, and
even his job, she said.

THE COST IS NOT EXCESSIVE for hospitals to switch from
incineration to either on-site autoclaves or regional
autoclave facilities for their medical waste management,
says a soon-to-be-released cost analysis by a New York
environmental group. "We're finding its a small part of
hospitals' operating budgets," said Center for Biology of
Natural Systems' Catherine Hill. "We think its feasible."
Hill said researchers focused on the "most accepted"
alternative to incineration in crunching numbers on the
attractiveness of abandoning incineration. The group, housed
at Queens College, also factored in the necessary waste
management costs after using the steam sterilizer.

MEDICAL WASTE BECAME A TARGET for the environmental group
when it embarked on a study of air pollution sources in the
Great Lakes (MWN, May 30, p. 84). That study recommended
medical waste be sterilized and landfilled, rather than
incinerated, to decrease dioxin compounds in the Great Lakes
region. According to Hill, EPA's dioxin numbers for medical
waste incinerators were accurate for the time data were
collected in 1989/1990. Since then, more than one-half of
the incinerators have shut down, so the report may not be an
accurate snapshot of today's dioxin burden, Hill noted.

THE GROUP's FINDINGS on the benefit of autoclaves is not
news to Vicky Jas at the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center,
whose comprehensive cost analysis convinced the hospital to
shut down its incinerator and apply for a permit to operate
an autoclave (see story, p. 5).

JCAHO ISSUES BLUEPRINT FOR
HOSPITAL WASTE MANAGEMENT


     The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare
Organizations (JCAHO) recently prescribed its plan for a
safe environment.

     According to the latest manual, hospital leaders
should: plan for waste management space, equipment and
resources; educate staff about the role of environment in
supporting patient care; develop standards to measure
hospital performance in managing and improving the
environment; and develop an Information Collection and
Evaluation System to continuously measure environmental
care.

     The manual outlines what should be included in a
hazardous materials and waste management plan, and the
standards for personnel to meet in selecting, handling,
storing, using and disposing of waste.

     For more information, contact JCAHO, One Renaissance
Boulevard, Oakbrook, Ill. 60181; 708-916-5635.

NRC REJECTS THREE SCENARIOS
FOR FUTURE OF LLW PROGRAM


     None of the three Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff
scenarios for the future of the commission's low-level
radioactive waste (LLW) program is satisfactory, NRC's
Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste (ACNW) concluded Dec.
29.

     Facing severe federal budget cuts, the staff report
looked at three scenarios: continue the current program,
reduce the program by eliminating or cutting back various
parts, or terminate all parts of the LLW program.

     The staff concluded the present program could not
continue at present budgetary levels, but the entire program
could not be abolished because that move would require major
changes in a number of pieces of federal legislation. The
only viable solution, therefore, is a drastically reduced
program.

     The major failing of the staff report "is the failure
to address the question of what the LLW program ought to be
in order to satisfy the mission of the NRC," ACNW Chairman
Paul Pomeroy said in his letter to NRC Chairman Shirley Ann
Jackson.

     The budgetary focus of the report fails to address
NRC's fundamental responsibility to protect the health and
safety of the public. "Budgetary reductions need to be made
in accordance with priorities set with reference to the
underlying mission of the NRC," ACNW said.

     Necessary elements in the reshaped LLW program are: a
staff that includes experts in each of the technologies
critical to evaluation of the siting, environmental impact,
operation and closure of LLW facilities; a program that
provides technical assistance to those preparing license
applications for LLW disposal facilities; a program that
maintains NRC's capability for processing license
applications from non-Agreement states for LLW disposal
facilities; and a program that identifies and supports
limited research activities in priority areas and assures
that the information value is maintained from studies that
are terminated or transferred to other programs.

NURSING STAFF INJURY is on tap in the new Institute of
Medicine (IOM) report to be released in mid-January. The
report-Nursing Staff in Hospitals and Nursing Homes: Is it
Adequate?- focuses on how the unprecedented change in the
health care industry has affected the occupational health of
nurses, as well as patient care. IOM kicked off the probe in
response to a congressional request. For information,
contact IOM, 202-334-2138.

LATEST MARKET REPORT PREDICTS
SAFETY SYRINGE SALES TO RISE


     More than 4.8 million needles and syringes were sold in
the United States in 1994, and safety syringe sales were
forecasted to jump at least 45 percent by the end of 1995,
said a new market report on the medical disposal market.

     Connecticut-based Theta Corporation predicted safety
syringe sales would increase more than 45 percent with unit
shipments to exceed 2.25 billion by the end of 1995.

     The report provided an in-depth analysis of the largest
U.S. disposal medical equipment products market. The latest
report, Dynamic Medical Disposal Market, forecasted market
trends through 2001 for the following products: needles and
syringes, procedure kits and trays, evacuated blood
collection tubes, respiratory therapy disposables and
infusion disposables.

Needle Sticks Drive Market

     According to Theta Corp., the most significant trend
affecting the medical disposables market is the increasing
awareness of the danger of bloodborne pathogen infections
from accidental needle sticks.  The greatest commercial
success will come from new features incorporated into
existing products offered by vendors who currently dominate
the market, the firm found.

     Safety needles and syringes are expected to reach
market penetration exceeding 80 percent by 2001, the report
predicted, and while the products may become more popular,
safety product prices will also decline dramatically. Since
1992, the U.S. Patent Office has approved more than 500
patents for safety features for syringes and needles.

     Today more than 60 percent of all surgical procedures
involve use of a kit, and the report charted the market for
the following procedure kits and trays: cardiovascular,
angiography and angioplasty, orthopedic, OB/GYN, ophthalmic,
endoscopic and others.

     Theta Corp. predicted sales of all respiratory therapy
disposables would reach 38.6 million units by 2001, and that
compound annual growth rates of 17.1 percent was anticipated
for sales of infusion sets from 1995 to 2001.

     Fifteen companies were selected for detailed profiles
that included information on product development, products
and marketing strategies: Baxter International Inc., Becton
Dickinson and Co., C.R. Bard, Inc., Hudson Respiratory Care
Inc., Invacare Corp., Isolyser Co., Inc., Johnson & Johnson,
Marquest Medical Products, Inc., MAXXIM Medical, Inc.,
Puritan-Bennett Corp., The Med-Design Corp., Sherwood
Medical, Siemens Medical System, Inc., Smiths Industries and
Sterile Concepts.

HRCC TO CONSIDER NATIONAL MODELS
FOR MINIMIZING MEDICAL WASTES


     The Healthcare Resource Conservation Coalition (HRCC),
an ad hoc group of suppliers, haulers and hospitals, will
review national models that have proven successful in
minimizing medical waste at its next meeting in May.

     The reach of the nonprofit communications group has
been expanding over the last year. While not included at
first, waste haulers have joined the group of those
interested in solving medical waste problems, said Mayo
Medical Center's Director of Waste Management Terry Horseth.
The group recently has incorporated as a nonprofit network
and includes 50 members, such as representatives from Baxter
International Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Beth Israel Hospital
and Kaiser Permanente.

     Horseth said everyone recognizes education is key in
keeping health care organizations, manufacturers, suppliers
and government informed on the issues. "There is no central
place to find out all the information. Everyone must keep
reinventing their own wheel," he said.

     The meetings have been valuable, explained Horseth,
since all players in medical waste management share
information on what is happening nationwide, as well as
finding solutions to thorny local problems. Medical waste
management issues vary as widely as state and local
regulations, and HRCC members have the advantage of keeping
up on ever-changing waste management and recycling markets.

     "Right now we're looking for success stories," said
Horseth, who touted recycling efforts at the Mayo Center in
Rochester, Minn. The next meeting is tentatively slated for
May in Chicago.

     HRCC offers a communications network for all members of
the health care community to tackle issues such as waste
minimization, waste and product management and government
regulation.

     For information on HRCC, contact Terry Horseth, 507-
284-1912.

ISWA FORMS NEW WORKING GROUP
TO RESPOND TO MEDWASTE ISSUES


     The International Solid Waste Association (ISWA) has
formed a new working group to deal with health care waste
issues.

     ISWA members have worked closely with the World Health
Organization in assisting countries in preparing their
national policies on health care waste management, said a
recent bulletin from The World Resource Foundation.

     The group has also named a new chairman: Bill Townend,
deputy director of the London Waste Regulation Authority
(LWRA). Townend represented ISWA on the European Union
Priority Waste Stream Project on health care waste that was
completed last year.

     For information on ISWA's new group, contact Bill
Townend, LWRA, Hampton House, 20 Albert Embankment, London

ACQUISITIONS DRIVE SUCCESS
FOR MID-SIZED WASTE FIRMS


     Mid-sized solid waste companies had the most pronounced
growth in the industry during 1995, with revenues increasing
69 percent to $2 billion, and the trend should continue,
according to a report by Raymond James & Associates, a
financial analysis company in St. Petersburg, Fla.

     The report found that acquisition growth accelerated
over the past year. The top 13 waste companies are expected
to increase their revenues by 21 percent, with a major
revenue component driven by acquisitions.

     On financing issues, the report explained, "We wish to
stress that the improvement in the cost of financing has
been most notable for the smaller waste service companies. A
longer track record leading to enhanced credibility has
enabled these companies to dramatically lower their costs of
capital and benefit not only from lower rates, but from the
access to longer term financing and attractively priced
equity."

     In general, the analysis said, long term financing
rates for all firms, as represented by 30-year Treasury
bonds, have dropped considerably, thus providing a backdrop
for continued aggressive acquisition.

     For copies of the report, Solid Waste 1995: Mid-Sized
Companies Lead Industry in a Torrid Acquisition, contact the
firm's William Fisher, 800-237-5643.

EPA ESTIMATES STAFF LAYOFFS
FROM REPUBLICAN BUDGET OFFER


     Up to one-fourth of the Environmental Protection
Agency's staff may be laid off by spring unless Republicans
substantially increase EPA's funding, said EPA Administrator
Carol Browner. EPA's budget could have dramatic implications
for its medical waste emissions rule and its long-awaited
report to Congress.

     About one-third of the workers who promulgate
regulations, issue permits and perform inspections could be
laid off if Congress approves the EPA appropriations bill
vetoed by President Clinton, agency officials said.
Researchers and employees involved in environmental cleanups
would not be cut. EPA officials were hesitant until now to
estimate the impact of the budget cuts on staffing.

     At a Dec. 18 press conference, President Clinton vetoed
the $5.7 billion spending bill, insisting the measure would
have cut environmental enforcement by 25 percent and safe
drinking water aid to local governments by 45 percent.

     In response, Sen. Christopher Bond (R-Mo.) argued that
the cuts were based on recommendations from organizations
including the National Academy of Public Administration.

AUTOCLAVING VIEWED AS APPEALING
FOR HOSPITAL WEIGHING WASTE OPTIONS


     Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center may become the
state's first facility to shut down an incinerator and open
an autoclaving facility in a dramatic move to save money and
avoid having to comply with costly new emission regulations.

     The medical center's Vicky Jas conducted a
comprehensive, 12-year cost analysis that compared
retrofitting the existing incinerator to shipping wastes
off-site, autoclaving or using a gas sterilizer. Autoclaving
was by far the least expensive option, she said.

     "We had the resources to evaluate these, while others
are running scared," said Jas, who added that many hospitals
have already inquired about when the facility will be up and
running.

     The Lebanon, N.H., facility is hoping to be granted its
state permit soon, begin testing the new autoclave facility
on Jan. 29, and have it on-line in February. Right now, the
hospital is spending $5,000 a week to ship the wastes off-
site. With tens of millions being slashed from the
hospital's yearly budget, staff had to look for less costly
alternatives.

     "None of us was crazy about autoclaving since there is
still waste at the end," she explained. But Jas said the
hospital said the gas sterilizer manufacturer could not
gather independent emissions data for permit approval.

     Another item that may be on the agenda for hospital
administrators to consider include training a certified
workforce who would be involved only with waste management
in the hospital complex. Jas said she is looking into this
option to beef-up the education of hospital staff who handle
wastes.

EPA AUDIT POLICY SPELLS RELIEF
FOR CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL VIOLATORS


     Companies that report self-discovered environmental
violations within 10 days and act to correct those
violations will be eligible for reduced penalties or waivers
for civil violations and no criminal sanctions under the
Environmental Protection Agency's final policy on
environmental audits.

     The policy, which appeared in the Dec. 22 Federal
Register, does not apply to violations that harm human
health and the environment.

     The issue of EPA enforcement against self-discovered
violations has been a sticking point for many companies.

     Under the new approach, EPA retains its power to levy
fines that equal any economic gain created by the violation
in order to "preserve a level playing field." EPA also will
override state laws shielding results of corporate self-
audits from enforcement if the violations threaten public
health or the environment. At the same time, the agency said
"where a state has obtained appropriate sanctions needed to
deter such misconduct, there is no need for EPA action."

     The final policy is similar to an interim policy
released in March. The earlier statement applied only to
self-audits, while the final statement covers other self-
discovery steps such as due diligence. EPA defines due
digilence as systemic efforts to prevent, detect and correct
violations.

Audit Results Not 'Privilege'

     EPA will continue its policy on not routinely
requesting the results of corporate self-audits, although
the agency reiterated its position that environmental self-
audits and related corporate self-discovery activities are
not privileged information protected from public disclosure.
This contrasts sharply with an increasing number of state
laws that provide varying degrees of privilege for audit
results.

     EPA said it will reduce gravity-based civil penalties
by up to 75 percent. These penalties, which are based on the
severity of the pollution problem and not on economic gains,
could be waived. The policy spells out a list of conditions
that must be met to become eligible for reduced or no civil
penalties provisions.

NEW HAMPSHIRE WASTE REGULATORS
AWAIT EPA REPORT, AIR STANDARDS


     New Hampshire regulators are holding tight on amending
medical waste regulations until the Environmental Protection
Agency's long-awaited report to Congress is released, said
New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services' Carl
Woodbury.

     Woodbury said New Hampshire regulators are not only
anticipating EPA's report but also its new Clean Air Act
regulation for emissions from medical waste incinerators.
State regulations have already incorporated a treatment
standard similar to EPA's, he said.

     New Hampshire houses one commercial incinerator
operated by Waste Management of New England that accepts
medical waste, while there are approximately 15 small
incinerators at hospitals across the state.

     "A lot of material is still going to landfills,"
Woodbury noted. Under state regulations, medical waste must
be treated before disposal "to achieve high-level
disinfection plus a four log reduction 104 of Bacillus
subtilis, for example by infectious waste incineration,
steam sterilization, chemical disinfection, or gas
sterilization."

Autoclave Breaks New Ground

     The responsibility is on the manufacturer to prove
alternative treatment technologies are effective, Woodbury
said, noting that the state requires data with independent
laboratory confirmation. "We don't want to see just the
marketers," he added.

     But Vicky Jas, manager of the Dartmouth Hitchcock
Medical Center's Biosafety and Environmental Programs,
complained that the state had little regulation for
alternative treatment technologies, even the more
traditional autoclaving. "We really started from scratch,"
she said. "The only standard the state relied on was whether
the technology killed the bugs," Jas said.

     Woodbury said New Hampshire hospitals are eying how the
medical center is managing its wastes to decide what path to
follow in the wake of looming EPA regulation. In August, the
hospital shut down its incinerator and has applied to
operate a less-costly, commercial-sized autoclave to
sterilize wastes on-site.

     After extensive research involving a cost analysis, the
hospital opted to get out of the incinerator business, said
the state's medical waste regulator. "Other hospitals are
looking to them for guidance."

     Under New Hampshire regulations, there are certain
treatment and disposal exemptions. Limbs and recognizable
organs are to be disposed of by incineration or interment.
Non-infectious blood and body fluids and non-infectious
tissues processed by grinding may be disposed of in sanitary
sewers. Gloves, gowns and other materials that have not come
in contact with significant quantities of blood, body fluids
or secretions should not be handled as infectious wastes.
Certain animal carcasses need not be regulated as infectious
wastes, and sharp infectious wastes can be incinerated or
landfilled if treated first. Household sharp infectious
waste can be handled as municipal solid waste if
containerized.

     Medical waste cannot be stored at room temperature for
more than 72 hours, and waste stored at processing
facilities that receive waste from off-site generators
cannot be stored for more than seven days. The waste is
required to be stored and transported in a sealed, non-
permeable 3-mil polyethylene bag, placed in another bag of
similar construction and sealed.

     Sharp infectious waste, such as broken glass, scalpel
blades and hypodermic needles, must be segregated and en-
cased inside rigid, puncture-resistant containers before the
material is placed in polyethylene bags. Under New Hampshire
law, sharps are not required to be ground up and rendered
non-usable before disposal.

SLANTS AND TRENDS


NO CIGAR: None of the three Nuclear Regulatory Commission
staff scenarios for the future (or non-future) of the
commission's low-level radioactive waste (LLW) program are
satisfactory, NRC's Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste
(ACNW) concluded Dec. 29. Facing severe federal budget cuts,
the July staff report looked at three scenarios: continue
the current program, reduce the program by eliminating or
cutting back various parts, or terminate all parts of the
LLW program. The staff concluded the present program could
not continue at present budgetary levels, but the entire
program could not be abolished because it requires major
changes in a number of pieces of federal legislation. The
only viable solution, therefore, is a drastically reduced
program (NWN, Oct. 26, 1995, p. 413).

   The major failing of the staff report, "is the failure to
address the question of what the LLW program ought to be in
order to satisfy the mission of the NRC," ACNW Chairman Paul
Pomeroy said in his letter to NRC Chairman Shirley Ann
Jackson. The budgetary focus of the report fails to address
NRC's fundamental responsibility to protect the health and
safety of the public. "Budgetary reductions need to be made
in accordance with priorities set with reference to the
underlying mission of the NRC," ACNW said.

   Necessary elements in the rescaled LLW program are: a
staff that includes experts in each of the technologies
critical to evaluation of the siting, environmental impact,
operation and closure of LLW facilities; a program that
provides technical assistance to those preparing license
applications for LLW disposal facilities; a program that
maintains NRC's capability for processing license
applications from non-Agreement states for LLW disposal
facilities; and a program that identifies and supports
limited research activities in priority areas and assures
that the information value is maintained from studies that
are terminated or transferred to other programs.

   Some areas targeted for termination or limited support in
the staff report need re-evaluation. These include review of
topical reports and the quality of Agreement-State programs
and NRC representation of the U.S. LLW policy.

   % Pomeroy's letter to Jackson, 8 pp., is available for
purchase through BPI DocuDial, No. 48-1111, as is the July
31 report to the commission from the NRC staff, 29 pp., No.
48-1112.

ARTHUR D. LITTLE AWARDED $7.6 MILLION
TO HELP BELARUS TACKLE MISSILES


by Gordon Feller

   The international consulting firm Arthur D. Little has
been awarded a $7.6 million contract to help the former
Soviet republic of Belarus solve nuclear waste, safety and
other environmental problems related to its former Strategic
Rocket Forces (SRF) bases.

   The two-and-a-half-year contract from the Defense Nuclear
Agency (DNA) is part of the Cooperative Threat Reduction
(CTR) Program developed under the l991 Nunn-Lugar
legislation. The program was set up to assist the countries
of the former Soviet Union in elimination of weapons of mass
destruction and prevention of their proliferation.

   Arthur D. Little experts will help Belarus personnel to
assess radiation and conventional environmental damage at
sites where intercontinental ballistic missiles were based,
transported, operated or maintained, and will help the
country restore them for other purposes. In Belarus alone,
at the height of the arms race, there were more than 80 SS-
25 missiles. Belarus has since declared itself a non-nuclear
state and wishes to return the facilities to civilian use.

   Arthur D. Little consultants will integrate a number of
different technical resources within the program to provide
training and technical assistance to the Belarus officials
and experts. The consultants will work with the Belarus
personnel to analyze the environmental problems at one
missile site and devise a restoration plan, then oversee the
Belarus technicians as they do environmental restoration
work at a second site. The ultimate goal is to transfer
enough knowledge to Belarus so that it can complete the
environmental restoration work at the remaining sites.

   Potential environmental problems include heavy metal and
low-level radioactive contaminants, spilled petroleum,
spilled liquid rocket fuel, and some minefields around the
sites' perimeters containing unexploded ordnances.

   As part of the effort to transfer environmental
restoration expertise, Arthur D. Little will conduct
international conferences co-sponsored by DNA and the
Belarus Ministry of Defense. Experts from around the world
will be invited to Belarus to discuss environmental
restoration experiences, technologies, and management
issues.

   As part of the CTR program, an agreement was signed in
l993 between the United States and the Republic of Belarus
to assist in development of the Environmental Restoration
Project. Other CTR projects in Belarus under Nunn-Lugar
include assistance in defense conversion, export control
systems and training, government-to-government
communications links, and emergency response equipment and
training.

   Belarus, located between Poland and Russia, has an
especially high water table and active ground water
movement, which can exacerbate ground water pollution.

   Other organizations involved with Arthur D. Little on the
Environmental Restoration Project include the Army Corps of
Engineers' Waterways Experiment Station, Los Alamos
Technical Associates, Technology Management Co., the
Environmental Chemical Corp., Environmental Hazards
Specialists International, Environmental Careers
Organizations, the World Environment Center, and Clean Sites
Inc.

   Arthur D. Little, which managed the largest environmental
impact assessment ever conducted in the Former Soviet Union
by a Western company, has handled more than 3,000
environmental audits and assessments in 30 countries
throughout Europe and the United States. Headquartered in
Cambridge, MA., Arthur D. Little has offices around the
world. It provides consulting in three areas: environmental,
health, and safety consulting; management consulting; and
technology and product development.

RUSSIAN NUCLEAR SAFETY: Viktor Mikhailov, Russia's minister
of nuclear energy, announced Jan. 2 that nuclear smuggling
should be the top item on the agenda for the April G-7
summit in Moscow. Mikhailov said the summit, devoted to
nuclear safety issues, should draft "common procedures" for
dealing with nuclear smuggling and tightening control over
nuclear materials. He also announced his ministry made $1.65
billion from exports in 1995, a significant contribution to
Russia's $63 billion in total exports, and not much less
than the $2.5 billion Russia earned by exporting arms.
However, many of the countries that want to purchase Russian
civilian nuclear technology, such as Iran and Cuba, have a
questionable ability to pay for it, casting doubt on
Mikhailov's prediction that nuclear exports can be boosted
to $2 billion by 1998.

REPROCESSING AT SRS CHEAPER
THAN REPOSITORY, REPORT FINDS


   Using existing facilities at DOE's Savannah River Site
(SRS), Aiken, S.C., to reprocess civilian spent fuel (SF)
would be considerably cheaper than continuing with the
current repository program, concluded a report prepared by
Westinghouse Savannah River Co. for DOE at the request of
Rep Charles Norwood (R-Ga.).

   The report, delivered to DOE Aug. 21, is unclassified,
but has not been officially released by DOE or Norwood's
office.(% Available through BPI DocuDial, 28 pp., No. 48-
1110.)

   Questions about using SRS to reprocess spent civilian
fuel and the impact on the civilian waste program prompted
Norwood to make the request, an aide said. Reprocessing
operations could provide an economic boon to the region
around SRS.

   The report, Chemical Stabilization of Defense Related and
Commercial Spent Nuclear Fuel at the Savannah River Site,
said a repository is required, even with reprocessing. But
"technical uncertainty would be significantly lessened by
the 20-fold volume reduction, and the conversion of the
waste to a single form containing only short-lived, non-
fissile products."

Billions To Be Saved?

   Westinghouse estimates the annual cost of reprocessing
civilian spent fuel at $350 million a year and the cost for
dealing with the current inventory of spent civilian fuel at
$8 billion, including estimated repository fees. "Chemical
stabilization is almost certainly less costly than direct
disposition technology, maybe by several billion dollars,"
the report said.

   "These facilities could consolidate and stabilize nuclear
wastes into manageable and ultimately disposable forms,
thereby providing a bridge to the future when decisions will
have to be made as to the long-term approach to energy
production, defense needs and nuclear waste management in
this country," the report said.

   Besides costs savings, reprocessing civilian SF at SRS
solves on-site storage problems at commercial nuclear
powerplants and allows DOE to comply with the Nuclear Waste
Policy Act by accepting SF by 1998, the report said.

   Under the plan spelled out in the Westinghouse report, SF
now stored at SRS would be reprocessed and then the facility
could provide "ongoing treatment services for a wide variety
of defense and commercial spent fuels." Radioactive waste
produced from the reprocessing operation would be vitrified
in borosilicate glass logs. DOE could either sell
reprocessed civilian fuel back to powerplants or dispose of
it in a repository.

Upgrade Costs Omitted

   In estimating the cost of reprocessing civilian SF at
SRS, the report does not include the costs of upgrades
needed for the F- and H- canyons. John Duane, a Westinghouse
manager who helped prepare the report, said the upgrades
could be anywhere from minor to major, depending on what
types of fuel will be reprocessed. It was an oversight that
upgrade costs were omitted; they should be in the report, he
said.

   A standard shear/leach process would be used to process
commercial SF. The report estimates these upgrades would
cost $100 million. After that, only normal capital upgrades
would be needed, Duane said. Brian Costner, of the Energy
Research Foundation, an SRS watchdog group, disputes those
figures. When SRS reprocessing operations stopped in 1992,
major upgrades to the facility were never completed.
Completing the upgrades is expensive, Costner said. Duane,
however, said about three-quarters of the planned upgrades
were completed before the shutdown. The buildings are 40
years old, but the reprocessing equipment is fairly new, he
added.

   Costner thinks the purpose of the report is to build
political support for commercial reprocessing. He expects
reprocessing supporters to use it to press for a change in
U.S. policy, which now prohibits civilian SF reprocessing.
Reprocessing, however, is gaining support in Congress.

   Norwood's office had no comment on whether the
representative would propose legislation to open SRS for
civilian reprocessing. At press time Jan. 4, Norwood was
touring SRS and would make a decision based on what he
learned during the tour, an aide said.

   Using a U.S. defense facility to reprocess civilian SF is
a new idea and sets a dangerous precedent, said Arjun
Makhijani, president of the Institute for Energy and
Environmental Research. The report is "a clear waste of
taxpayers dollars and a dangerous waste of taxpayer
dollars," he said.

   No other Congress members contacted by NWN had seen the
report. Nuclear-industry representatives also were
unfamiliar with it or any plans to reprocess civilian fuel
at SRS.

AUSTRALIANS TO USE BATTELLE ISV
PROCESS TO CLEAN MARALINGA


   An in-situ vitrification (ISV) system developed for DOE
by Battelle is receiving international attention. The
Australians tested the process for treating contaminated
areas of the Maralinga test range in South Australia. The
tests, carried out by Geosafe, a Battelle subsidiary, ended
in October 1995.

   The British used Maralinga as a  nuclear test site in the
1950s and subsequently contaminated several kilometers of
desert. Most of the contamination is plutonium, and includes
21 pits containing equipment contaminated with transuranics.
The Australians expect the cleanup of Maralinga to cost
about $100 million Australian, equal to $75 million U.S.
(NWN, June 6, 1995, p. 243).

   The Australians hope to use in-situ treatment to deal
with the pits. The Geosafe tests involved 13 test melts over
six-months. Initial tests used a surrogate for the nuclear
materials, but the final two tests used actual
radionuclides. One five-ton test melt used soil and debris
containing a kilogram of uranium as well as hazardous metals
and large quantities of scrap metals.

   Another test melt used not only uranium-contaminated
soil, but also a steel plate contaminated with about two
grams of plutonium. The Australian Nuclear Science and
Technology Organization is analyzing the radioactive
samples.

   The Australians are looking at radionuclide distribution
within the vitrified material and at the strength of the
material. They also will conduct leach testing of the
vitrified material. Test results should be available early
this year, Geosafe said.

   Test results show the in-situ vitrification process can
be used to treat the 21 contaminated pits, Geosafe said.
"Most notably, the radioactive testing did not result in
contamination of the off-gas hood or piping, indicating very
high uranium and plutonium retention efficiencies in the
vitrified product," according to a Geosafe test report.

DESIGN PROBLEMS DELAY FERNALD
LLW VITRIFICATION TESTS


   Design problems will delay the start-up of a pilot low-
level radioactive waste vitrification plant at DOE's
Fernald, Ohio, site by 17 months. But the problems will not
delay completion of the 10-year cleanup plan for the
facility, Fernald officials say.

   The $21-million vitrification plant, built by GTS Duratek
of Columbia, Md., was scheduled for surrogate testing in
July 1995, but DOE moved the start date of testing with a
uranium substitute to March 1996, said Perry Richardson, a
Fernald Environmental Restoration Management Co. (FERMCO)
spokesman.

   DOE initially had problems getting bids on a melter for
the pilot plant. Originally, DOE requested a melter capable
of operating at temperatures of 1,450 degrees C and able to
process five tons of material per day. DOE revised its
specification, requesting a melter capable of handling only
one ton of material per day.

   Superfund deadlines forced parallel design of portions of
the plant that should have been designed in sequence,
officials said. The delays do not surprise Richardson. "This
is the closest thing to research and development we have at
Fernald," he said. A few "bumps" in the process should be
expected, he added.

'We Were Overly Optimistic'

   Fernald also overestimated the amount of time the pilot
plant could operate. Initial plans were to operate the
facility continuously, but FERMCO decided that was not
realistic. "We were overly optimistic," Richardson said.

   For planning purposes, Fernald officials are assuming the
melter will operate 30 percent of the time, although
Richardson said he thinks the actual operational operating
time will be better.

   DOE eventually will vitrify 9,700 tons of uranium mill
tailings now stored on site at Fernald. Information gathered
from the pilot plant operation will be used to design a $200
million full-scale vitrification plant, capable of
processing 30 tons of material per day.

   DOE plans to vitrify all the mill tailings at Fernald and
send the vitrified waste to a disposal facility on the
Nevada Test Site before 2005, Richardson said.

DAVIS BESSE: Toledo Edison Co. Dec. 26 began transferring
spent fuel from the fuel storage pool at its Davis Besse
nuclear power plant to three dry storage casks at an
independent spent fuel storage facility on the plant site.
The three casks will hold 72 fuel assemblies. The plant
needed to free space in the storage pool to receive new fuel
and to unload the full reactor core during a refueling
outage in April. Inspectors from the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission's Region III office, Lisle, Ill., are monitoring
the fuel transfer.

SDMP
NRC LISTS A MIXED LOT OF 47
SITES ON LATEST SDMP TALLY


   The latest version of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's
Site Decommissioning Management Plan (SDMP) list, released
Dec. 26, shows 47 sites that still must be either evaluated
or remediated under the SDMP program. These sites are a
mixed bag of possibly contaminated sites where remediation
was in danger of falling through the cracks in NRC's
licensing system.

   SDMP sites vary in the degree of radiological hazard,
decommissioning complexity and cost. Some sites comprise
tens of acres that require assessment for radiological
contamination; others have contamination known to be limited
to individual buildings or discrete piles of waste or
contaminated soil. Some sites still have active NRC nuclear
materials licenses.

   Some sites already are almost completely cleaned; others
have had little or no remediation.

   NRC has removed nine sites from the SDMP list since the
program began in 1990. Some of these sites have been
successfully cleaned; others are cases where NRC deferred
oversight to other agencies or determined the site was not
subject to NRC licensing.

   Sites are added to the list if they satisfy one or more
of the following criteria:

Problems with the viability of the responsible organization,
e.g. inability to pay for or unwillingness to perform
decommissioning.

Presence of large amounts difficult-to-dispose material such
as soil contamination, unused settling ponds or waste in
burial grounds.

Long-term presence of contaminated, unused facility
buildings.

Previously terminated license.

Contamination or potential contamination of the ground water
from on-site wastes.

   The 47 sites on the new list are:

   Indiana (1): Jefferson Proving Ground;

   Maryland (2): Anne Arundel County Curtis Bay site;
Aberdeen Proving Ground;

   Massachusetts (6): Engelhard Corp., Plainville; Nuclear
Metals Inc., Concord; Texas Instruments Inc., Attleboro;

ORNL CONTAMINATED SITES OFFERED
FOR JOINT GROUND WATER RESEARCH


   DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory, near Oak Ridge,
Tenn., is offering use of previously studied field sites at
the laboratory for collaborative ground water research. Past
disposal of radioactive and mixed radioactive hazardous
waste at Oak Ridge has led to concerns about ground water
contamination that require a better understanding of the
complex subsurface heterogeneous fractured media. Past
research has focused on water and contaminant movement.

   Sites the laboratory is making available for
collaborative research include:

   Walker Branch Watershed and Melton Branch Watersheds:
These small watersheds (0.47 ha and 0.62 ha, respectively)
are particularly suitable for studies of subsurface
transport processes. Each has a trench excavated across its
outflow region. Trenches are 2.5 m deep and 16 m long, and
contain six pans pressed against the face of the trench to
collect subsurface seepage outflow. A line source for tracer
distribution is buried at the top of each site. Transects of
solution samplers, tensiometers and piezometers are located
throughout the site. Much of the data-collection equipment
is interfaced for computerized data collection.

   West Bear Creek Valley Tracer Test Site: This site was
developed for investigating new ground water tracer
techniques. It is located in an uncontaminated area, and has
been instrumented with more than 70 piezometers, some of
them multi-level, and a rain gauge. Water levels and
temperatures have been recorded at 30 minute intervals for
two years. During the last three years, three principal
tests have been conducted at this field site:

A one-year dissolved-gas tracer test using helium and neon
to test the effect of matrix diffusion on solute transport.

A natural-gradient test that used injection of colloid-size
tracers, including bacteriophage, microbes and microspheres,
to measure fracture-flow velocities.

A test using microspheres labeled with DNA as tracers of
fracture flow.

   Fractured Rock Sampling Protocol Site: This site has been
used for tracer tests to study ground water sampling methods
in fractured media. At the site, 5 to 6 m of soil and
saprolite overlies folded and fractured shale and limestone.
The site has an injection/pumping well screened from 6 to 20
m, three pairs of wells screened from 5 to 7 m and 18 to 20
m, and three multilevel wells with five sampling ports
installed close to the pairs of wells. Many data are
available from the site, including six pumping tests,
natural water levels, tracer tests using bromide, sulfur
hexafluoride and colloids, continuous core from three holes,
bore-hole flowmeter measurements, point dilution tests,
mineralogical data, field parameters, and geochemical
analyses.

   Tritium Test Site: In 1977, 50 curies of tritium were
released in an open borehole in fractured shale. Tritium was
monitored in the injection well and in five monitoring wells
for the first five years, with an additional sampling after
16 years (1993). Efforts to remove the tritium by pumping
were unsuccessful. A large amount of tritium was still
present after 16 years. Results of this test have been
interpreted to indicate the severe limitations of pump-and-
treat methods.

D&D
NRC INTENDS TO OKAY PGE'S
TROJAN DECOMMISSION PLAN


   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff intends to
approve Portland General Electric (PGE) Co.'s proposed
decommissioning plan for the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant near
Ranier, Ore.

   The plant was closed down in 1993 and all spent fuel has
been removed from the reactor and placed in the spent fuel
pool. The pressurizer and the four steam generators have
been removed from reactor containment and shipped to a low-
level radioactive waste disposal facility.

   NRC's latest proposed action would allow PGE to complete
decommissioning according to its proposed plan, submitted
Jan. 25, 1995. PGE intends to dismantle the plant using the
DECON alternative after a five-year transition period.

Transition Period

   During the transition period, which began with the
January 1993 shutdown date, PGE intends to remove and
dispose of selected large components; license and construct
an independent spent fuel storage installation (ISFSI); and
transfer fuel to the ISFSI. The utility also would assess
environmental impacts associated with construction and
operation of the ISFSI.

   The DECON phase will consist of the major disassembly and
dismantlement of radioactive structures, systems and
components. Low-level radioactive waste resulting from
dismantling the plant will be sent to a licensed waste
disposal site for burial.

   At the end of the DECON phase, the site, except for the
ISFSI, will be released for unrestricted use.

   Requests for a hearing on NRC's proposed approval of
PGE's decommissioning plan (Docket No. 50-344) must be
forwarded to the commission by Jan. 22. See the Federal
Register, Dec. 22, for details and instructions for
petitioning for a hearing. % Copies also are available for
purchase through BPI DocuDial, 3 pp., No. 48-1105.

NEWS BRIEFS


California and DOE's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
have agreed to work together to evaluate new environmental
technologies for certification under the state's
Environmental Technology Certification Program (ETCP). The
California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal/EPA) and
Livermore signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) giving
the state access to skilled laboratory personnel and
laboratory facilities to evaluate new technologies in
radioactive and hazardous waste management, site cleanup,
waste minimization and pollution prevention. In 1993, the
state set up the California Environmental Technology
Partnership (CETP) to promote research, development,
commercialization and export of California-based
environmental technology, goods and services. ETCP was
established by CalEPA's Department of Toxic Substances
Control in response to a CETP study of the state's $18
billion environmental technology industry that found a need
for a simpler, less cumbersome evaluation and permit
process. The program provides one-stop scientific and
engineering evaluation of new technologies to encourage
development and speed their acceptance. Contact: Dan
Pellissier, CalEPA, (916) 324-9670.

NCSL: The National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL)
has introduced a new version of LEGISNET, NCSL's intelligent
information retrieval system that includes the
Transportation Legislative Database (TLDB). TLDB is an on-
line information service containing summaries of federal,
state and certain local government statutes and regulations
relating to the transportation of radioactive materials in
the United States. TLDB is operated by NCSL under a
cooperative agreement with DOE's Office of Civilian
Radioactive Waste Management. Contact: Bob Frohling, NCSL,

DOE COMPLEX


DEAR: DOE has revised its Department of Energy Acquisition
Regulation (DEAR) to codify the department's technology
transfer mission for the national laboratories and weapons
production facilities operated by management and operating
(M&O) contractors. Details of the revised regulation appear
in the Dec. 22 Federal Register or % can be purchased
through BPI DocuDial, 7 pp., No. 48-1106.

Hanford: DOE and the Washington State Department of Ecology
seek public comments on DOE's proposal to amend the Hanford
Tri-Party Agreement to make it compatible with DOE's
proposal to privatization cleanup of Hanford's radioactive
waste tanks. Under the proposal, private companies will
contract with DOE to treat the wastes and return a treated
product to DOE. The department anticipates awarding multiple
contracts to encourage innovation and competition among
contractors. Selected contractors will invest private funds
to design, construct and operate the facilities needed to
meet the needs of the Tank Waste Remediation Systems. DOE
will define and monitor the requirements to be met by
selected contractors in order for treated tank waste to be
returned to DOE control after treatment. DOE will offer
incentives to contractors to reduce immobilized waste
volumes and optimize waste loading. The first phase of the
privatization strategy will demonstrate the technical and
business viability of using privatized facilities to treat
and immobilize the waste. The Phase One treatment facility
will be capable of treating six to 13 percent of the low-
activity tank wastes. In Phase Two, a full-scale production
facility would be capable of processing and immobilizing the
remaining waste on a schedule that would accommodate
removing waste from the single-shell tanks by 2018. Comments
are due Feb. 15. Public meetings are scheduled tentatively
for Jan. 30 in Portland, Ore., and Feb. 1 in Richland, Wash.
For more information, contact: Toby Michelena, Washington
Department of Ecology, (360) 407-7144; Carolyn Haass, DOE,

2008.

INEL: The Environmental Management Site-Specific Advisory
Board (SSAB) for Idaho National Engineering Laboratory will
meet Jan. 16-17 in Boise, Idaho. The purpose of the meeting
is to continue discussions of DOE's prioritizations of
environmental management (EM) funds for fiscal year 1998.
Other topics include the environmental restoration scoping
process, prioritization of the INEL SSAB's own activities
for the remainder of FY '96 and participation in an
educational activity highlighting research and development
capabilities at INEL. Contact: Idaho National Engineering

Oak Ridge: The Environmental Management Site-Specific
Advisory Board will meet Jan. 17 and Jan. 24 in Oak Ridge,
Tenn. The Jan. 24 meeting was called solely to discuss the
proposed by-laws for the board. The Jan. 17 meeting will
discuss not only the by-laws, but a report on an
administrative session held in Denver in November and a
technical presentation on results of the aerial remote-
sensing survey of the Oak Ridge Reservation. Contact: Sandy
Perkins, Site-Specific Advisory Board Coordinator, DOE, Oak

UMTRA: DOE has completed cleanup of uranium mill tailings
and contaminated materials from the 61-acre abandoned
uranium processing site southwest of Gunnison, Colo., under
the Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action Project (UMTRA).
Some 750,000 cubic yards of contaminated material was hauled
by truck to a disposal site seven miles east of the old
processing site. DOE and the state of Colorado jointly began
cleanup of the site in 1991 with demolition of the mill
buildings. The disposal cell was excavated in 1992 and
transportation of contaminated material to the cell began in
1993. Cleanup activities at the mill site ended in November,
and the cleaned areas were backfilled with clean soil to a
level comparable with the surrounding terrain. Construction
crews completed work on the disposal cell cover in December.
The Gunnison mill is the 16th of 24 congressionally
designated uranium mill tailings sites to be cleaned.

Rust Federal Services has entered into a Cooperative
Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with Kaiser-Hill
Co. LLC, operating contractor at DOE's Rocky Flats
Environmental Technology Site, for commercialization of
polymer encapsulation processes for stabilizing low-level
radioactive wastes (LLW) and mixed wastes. Personnel from
Rocky Flats developed a process to encapsulate LLW using
low-density polyethylene. Under the CRADA, Rust will examine
the economic feasibility of using waste plastic in the
encapsulation process. Low-density polyethylene, which
includes post-consumer products such as coffee can and
yogurt container lids, now is not recycled in Colorado. Rust
is working with its affiliate, Waste Management of Colorado
Inc., to determine if post-consumer plastic collection is
feasible. If it is, this could lead to full-scale
commercialization of the technology, with wide-ranging
applications at DOE sites and commercial nuclear plants.

Spring Cleanup Resumes on Alaska's Beaches

     On 1 May, Exxon deployed its first five cleanup squads,
totaling 100 workers from Seward and Valdez, back to the beaches
in Prince William Sound, Alaska, USA.  The beaches were polluted
by nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil that spilled from the
tanker Exxon Valdez in March 1989.
     For the past several weeks, survey teams walked these beaches
to determine both surface and subsurface oiling conditions.  The
teams -- made up of Exxon employees, state and federal
representatives, scientists, and land owners -- recorded their
observations with maps, sketches, and questionnaires that asked
about location, oil coverage, oil characteristics, and their
suggested method of cleanup.  Thus far, two out of three
surveillance phases are complete: crews have studied close to 480
miles of beach in Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska.
The third phase will begin this week and will address the
remaining priority areas in the Gulf of Alaska (86.4 miles).
     At the end of each day, the groups faxed their findings back
to Exxon's command center in Anchorage where a Technical Advisory
Group (the TAG team) in Anchorage plugged the information into a
decision matrix.  The TAG teams are made up of representatives
from Exxon, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation
(ADEC), the US Coast Guard (USCG), and the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
     Days before cleanup was to begin, crews deployed boom in
environmentally sensitive areas, near commercial fishing areas and
where wildlife has begun to migrate for the spring.  The squads
sent out on 1 May will begin removing tar mats and debris from:
Herring Bay; Seal Island; northwest Prince William Sound; south
Prince William Sound; and Kenai and the Gulf of Alaska.
     Officials have not yet established a general cleanup plan,
especially for subsurface oil.  The disagreement has, for the most
part, centered around the use of bioremediation.  Though there are
few practical alternatives to bioremediation, and although the
USCG, NOAA, and Exxon agree that it is the best solution for this
summer's cleanup, ADEC, which has undergone agency personnel
changes and claims there is not enough time and information to
make a knowledgeable decision, has not yet approved its use.  ADEC
is expected to give its answer within the next few days.

Bulgarian Vessel Sinks, Spills Diesel Fuel Near Stornoway,
Scotland

     At 0022 LT on 25 April, the 2,654-ton Bulgarian motor stern
fish factory ship Kondor sank three kilometers east of Kebock Head
(Lat 58 0.25N, Long 06 18.4W), south of the town of Stornoway, on
the Isle of Lewis, Scotland.  The vessel, owned by Okeansky
Ribolov of Bourgas, Bulgaria, was under tow following a grounding
on Sgeir Graidach (Lat 57 48N, Long 06 28W).  At 1600 LT, the crew
of the fishery protection vessel Sulisker confirmed that the
sunken vessel was leaking diesel oil and lubricating oil.  The
Kondor's masters estimated that there were 17,000 to 24,000
gallons of diesel oil and 1,500 to 1,800 gallons of lubricating
oil in the vessel's bunkers.  "Although there are no estimates of
the actual amount that has spilled thus far, all of it will
eventually seep out," said Ian Stephen, an officer with the
Stornoway Coast Guard.
     Officials were concerned about the proximity of the spill to
local fish farms and the use of dispersants in this location, even
though it was a "fairly light spillage," David Deas of the British
Marine Pollution Control Unit (MPCU) in London told OSIR.  The
MPCU finally gave permission for the Sulisker to apply 2.1 cubic
tons of dispersant at 2145 LT on the evening of 25 April.  The
MPCU, after approval from local authorities, the Nature
Conservancy Council, and the Department of Agriculture and
Fisheries in Scotland, applied an additional four tons of
dispersants from aircraft over the next two days.  The MPCU has
taken no further action after 28 April, according to Deas.
     Stephen told OSIR that the diesel fuel slick was surveyed
twice in the last two days -- once by a Coast Guard boat and once
by a Nature Conservancy boat.  Both surveys showed the 1.9- by
3.7- kilometer slick to be breaking up and moving north and south
away from the coastline of the Isle of Lewis.  "There was great
concern about the large number of fish farms in the sea lochs
along the coast," said Stephen, "but it may not be as bad as
originally feared."
     The Kondor, which was a part of a large fleet of "Klondikers"
that buy mackerel and herring fish from local fishermen during
on-sea transactions, will continue to leak what remains of its
fuel oil, according to Stephen.  "It is hoped that nature will
take its course and disperse the fuel oil naturally," Deas told
OSIR.

USCG Tanker Safety Study Group Releases Final Report

     The US Coast Guard (USCG) recently released its final report
of the Tanker Safety Study Group.  The five USCG officers in the
study group, headed by USCG Rear Admiral H.H. Bell, meant the
45-page report to be an internal working document.  However, the
report, dated October 1989, was made public two weeks ago.
     The report is a comprehensive review of the USCG's US and
foreign tankship inspection programs, a review that has not taken
place for over a decade.  Among the problems outlined in the
report, the study group found that: there are too few inspectors,
many of whom are overworked or inexperienced; present-day ships
are made with less steel and travel at higher speeds, making them
more vulnerable to cracking; and crews have been reduced, making
crewmembers fatigued and overworked.  "The age-old problem of too
few people and not enough fully qualified inspectors still exists.
These problems have been around for years although their magnitude
has increased rapidly since 1982.  Decreased budgets, manpower
cuts, larger ships, more sophisticated shipboard systems, quicker
turn-around times, and the shifting emphasis of USCG duties from
safety to law enforcement have had far-reaching effects on the
program."
     For a copy of the report, contact the OSIR Hotline.

US EPA Extends Compliance Dates for UST operators

     The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently
extended the financial responsibility compliance dates for two
petroleum underground storage tank (UST) owners and operators.
Petroleum marketers owning between 13 and 99 tanks who were
required to comply by 26 April 1990, now have until 26 April 1991.
Those owning between one and 12 USTs, those having fewer than 100
at one site, non-marketers with less than $20 million tangible net
worth, and local governments have until 26 October 1991 to comply
instead of 26 October 1990.
     The requirements fall under subtitle I of the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, which demands that owners and
operators of USTs meet certain financial responsibilities in
cleanup and third-party damages resulting from leaks.  Petroleum
marketers owning 1,000 or more USTs and non-marketers with more
than $20 million in tangible net worth were required to comply in
January 1989; and petroleum marketers owning between 100 and 999
USTs were required to comply in October 1989.
     The EPA recognizes that those in the third and fourth
compliance groups, however, need more time to comply.  Many of
them cannot obtain insurance because they cannot meet insurers'
underwriting requirements.  "We heard loud and clear ... about
unnecessary hardships that would be imposed by the earlier
compliance dates," said EPA Administrator William K. Reilly.  "In
some cases, the affected service station or store is the only
available facility for miles around and without adequate assurance
funding would have had to close.  The challenge we face along with
Congress and the states is to protect groundwater and the
environment from leaking USTs while making sure that mom-and-pop
gas stations and other small operators are not subjected to
needless economic hardships because of real problems in securing
the required insurance arrangements.  This is a problem that we
intend to solve in order to make this important program succeed."
     To date, 34 states have enacted legislation creating state
assurance funds to help owners comply with the requirements and to
clean up releases.  However, the EPA has approved only seven of
these to be used as compliance mechanisms.  The states and the EPA
will use the additional time to approve the funds and make them
operational.

Amoco Pipeline Ruptures in Texas

     On 24 April, an Amoco pipeline ruptured and spilled an
estimated 50,000 gallons of crude oil into Millsap Lake, in
Millsap, Texas, USA.  Amoco spotted the four-inch-thick slick from
the air, and immediately hired local contractors to begin cleanup
efforts with sorbent booms and vacuum trucks.  Though workers
placed boom around the water intakes, heavy rains and local
flooding caused some oil and sorbent pads to be washed past the
booms and into the nearby Brazos River.  The Texas Department of
Health sampled the lake water, which services 300 customers, and
determined that Millsap's water requirements can be safely met by
adjusting the water intake to a depth of 30-48 inches.  Officials
expect environmental damage to be minimal.

US Barge Spills 10,000 Gallons in Texas

     The 246-foot US tank barge MGM 2001 leaked approximately
10,000 gallons of #2 diesel fuel into the Colorado River at the
Way Energy dock, Texas City, Texas, USA, on 22 April.  Workers
from Georgia Transporters of Panama City, Florida, USA -- the
operator of the tug that was pulling both the MGM 2001 and the MGM
2002 -- noticed the leak near the #1 starboard tank.  Divers
confirmed reports of a crack three to ten inches wide and five to
six feet long.  The barge carried a total of 500,000 gallons.
     The tug's operator first contacted the two companies in the
area, Way Energy and Hoechst Celanese Chemical, for assistance.
Celanese sent out about 300 feet of boom until Martin Gas Marine,
the owner of the barges, hired Garner Environmental Services of
Houston, Texas, to set up an additional 2,500 feet of containment
and sorbent boom around the barge, and at two locations across the
entrance to the Colorado River turning basin.  With the help of
sorbent pads and sweeps and vacuum trucks, crews were able to
recover about 44,000 gallons of oil/water.  Salvage crews pumped
the remaining oil in the tank to barge MGM 2002.  "This cleanup
went better than the one a month ago in Freeport, Texas (OSIR, 29
March)," Richard Rhodes, USCG investigation officer in charge of
pollution, told OSIR.  "This time we had better weather and tides
 ... and it was in an ideal area.  In the Freeport spill, the
tides switched three times on us."
     The barge is currently undergoing permanent repairs at the
Channel Shipyard in Channelview, Texas.  An investigation into the
cause of the accident is underway.  "The captain says he didn't
hit anything," said Rhodes, "but I can't imagine how that crack
got there."

Exxon Rejects Environmental Proposals

At Exxon's annual shareholders meeting on 25 April in Houston,
Texas, USA (OSIR, 24 April), Exxon overwhelmingly rejected six
proposals by a small portion of the 1,850 shareholders present to
establish "responsible" environmental policies, including a
proposal to adopt the "Valdez Principles," a set of corporate
guidelines to safeguard the environment.  Exxon further implied
that the company has no intention of voluntarily replacing its
tanker fleet with double-hulled vessels.

Judge Rules Against Limited Liability in Glacier Bay Spill

     US District Court Judge H. Russel Holland recently ruled that
the owner (Trinidad Shipping Co.) and operators of the tanker
Glacier Bay, which spilled 160,000 gallons of crude oil into Cook
Inlet, Alaska, USA, in 1987 may not limit their liability to $6.6
million, the value of the ship and its cargo, under the Liability
Limitation Act of 1851.  In its complaint, Trinidad claimed that
the 1851 law held precedence over the Trans-Alaska Pipeline
Authorization Act (TAPAA), which holds a spiller liable for $14
million and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Liability Fund liable for
another $86 million.  But Holland ruled that TAPAA repealed the
Limitation Act in this instance.

Comprehensive US Contingency Plan Review Due Out Shortly

     In an October 1989 US General Accounting Office study on the
adequacy of preparation and response of the US Coast Guard (USCG)
to the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the USCG reported that it had
initiated a nationwide study of contingency plans, "because of the
President's concern about the nation's ability to respond to major
spills."
     The USCG study has since evolved into a review by the entire
federal government including the fourteen agencies that make up
the National Response Team -- the Environmental Protection Agency,
the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, the
Department of Commerce, the Department of Agriculture, the
Department of Transportation, the State Department, the Department
of Labor, the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and
Human Services, the Department of the Interior, the Federal
Emergency Management Administration, the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission -- and all the USCG Regional Response Teams, according
to Commander Doug Lentsch of the USCG Chief Pollution Response
Branch in Washington, DC, USA.  The review includes a total of 75
reports from these various agencies.  "It will be a snapshot in
time, as to where we stood at the time the report was done,"
Lentsch told OSIR.  "The basis of it is well-founded.  What the
politicians will do with it is unknown."  According to Lentsch,
the nationwide US contingency plan review, still awaiting the
signatures of the Environmental Protection Agency and the
Secretary of Transportation, is due out in a few weeks.

Barge Spills 18,000 gallons of Gasoline in Kentucky

     On 23 April, the 206-foot US barge Chotin 2880 struck a
submerged object and spilled an estimated 18,000 gallons of
unleaded gasoline while mooring at the Southern States Petroleum
facility on the Ohio River, Owensboro, Kentucky, USA.  According
to the USCG Marine Safety Office in Louisville, Kentucky, the
submerged object, believed to be a "D" ring off of the mooring
cell, caused an 18-inch by 2-inch crack in the vessel's hull,
approximately six inches below the waterline.  Although crews
smelled gasoline, they did not observe a sheen, since most of the
gasoline evaporated in the warm weather.  A local cooperative,
Owensboro Cooperative, deployed boom around the vessel and
offloaded the remaining product.  The lightering of the vessel
caused the crack to rise above the waterline, which stopped the
discharge.  The vessel is currently on its way to Owensboro River
Service for permanent repairs.
     To prevent barges from hitting the "D" rings in the future,
USCG Lt. Terry Hoover told OSIR, the local towing company will
install fenders between the barges and the mooring cells and
Southern States will weld metal beams outside the mooring cells.

New Ozone Depleter Suit to be Filed

The Environmental Law Foundation (ELF), U.S. Public Interest
Research Group (PIRG), Earthday 2000 and Ozone Action will file suit 
January 6, 1996, against refrigerator manufacturers Maytag and Sanyo 
and their retailers Montgomery Ward, Circuit City and Basic Living 
Products. The suit alleges that the parties are in violation of the 
Clean Air Act in failing to label products manufactured with and 
containing CFCs.

The Clean Air Act states that all products containing or
manufactured with CFC must be labeled to warn consumers that the
chlorfluorocarbons are harmful to public health and the environment.  
Manufacturers Amana, GE and Whirlpool replaced CFCs with HCFCs in 
their refrigerators. As a result of another recent settlement with 
ELF, Ozone Action and Earthday 2000, these three manufacturers are 
required to halt all advertising that their HCFC refrigerators are 
"ozone free" or "CFC free."

According to ELF associate attorney Christine Mailloux, "The
CFC-containing refrigerators sold by Maytag and Sanyo pose far more
of a public threat than those containing HCFCs. Especially with 
other manufacturers selling HCFC-based models in the same stores, it 
is imperative that Maytag, Sanyo and their retailers comply with 
federal law to help consumers make more environmentally conscious 
decisions."

For details contact Kalee Krieder at 202/265-6738.

Industry Urges Contractors to Make Phaseout Plans

As the CFC phaseout takes effect, heating, ventilation and air 
conditioning industry contractors are being urged to make good on
their New Year's resolutions to start a retrofit/replacement program 
and to do it now.

Even though the use of equipment using CFCs is still legitimate, the 
cost of the refrigerant will continue to climb as time passes.  End 
users who have not looked at their options for phasing out equipment 
that uses CFCs will "have to think about the future," says Tom 
Crane, manager of communications for fluorine products of 
AlliedSignal Chemicals.

Melody Dixon-Brown, marketing communications program manager for
DuPont Fluoro-products warns that complacency is the major problem.
"It's prudent to have a transition plan," she said.  At the 
beginning of 1996, Dixon-Brown estimates that three million 
commercial refrigeration systems and 67,000 centrifugal chillers in 
the U.S. will still operate on CFCs, representing $135 billion of 
refrigeration and a/c equipment.

Dixon-Brown predicts that those still operating CFC-using products
will begin running into serious shortages within two to five years.
Speaking for Elf Atochem, Harold Lamb, business manager for 
refrigerants is not so sanguine: "I suspect we'll see spot shortages 
during the next year," said Lamb, who predicts shortages may become 
acute by 1997.  The tax on CFCs in the U.S. is now $5.35 per pound 
and will rise again in 1996.

Supermarkets in particular need to investigate options after taking
inventory of their existing equipment and its projected life,
manufacturers advise.  Retrofitting can be expensive but even 
changing to the use of more costly HFCs over HCFCs makes sense when 
equipment can expect a long service life since the refrigerant is 
not due to be phased out.  In some cases it will, in the long run, 
be less expensive to replace equipment entirely, the industry 
advises.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and DuPont 
suggest that the time to convince customers to switch to alternative 
refrigerants is during routine service jobs.

DuPont Says It Will Phase Out HCFCs 10 Years Early

DuPont, in an effort to stem criticism of its production of ozone
destroying products, says it will phase out HCFCs 10 years earlier
than the Montreal Protocol requires.

Earl Clark, senior refrigerant engineer for the company's CFC 
Retrofit Program announced the plan at the Mechanical Service 
Contractors of America's 10th annual conference in San Antonio 
recently.  Under the Protocol, a 100 percent phaseout of HCFC 
production is called for by 2030.  DuPont says it will discontinue 
sale of R-22 in new equipment by January 1, 2020.  The company, 
according to Clark, is working on an "aggressive industry program 
for R-22 replacements" to be in use by that date.

The gradual phaseout planned from 1996 through 2030 will probably be 
accomplished in Europe by 2015, Clark said.  The Clean Air Act now
says that a loss of 15 percent of HCFCs used in industrial air 
conditioning units of 50 pounds or more constitutes a violation and 
that fines of up to 25,000 per day may be levied by the EPA.

DuPont remains an advocate of HCFC in centrifugal and screw
chillers, however, along with residential air conditioners,
commercial and transport refrigeration and in heat pumps.  DuPont 
says advantages of R-22 include low toxicity and  ozone depletion 
potential (ODP) 20 times lower than R-11 or R-12.

HCFC-123, said Clark, is vital to DuPont's success, and points out
that its ODP and global warming potential (GWP) are far lower than
any other refrigerant.  The company also revealed that a two-year 
inhalation study completed in 1991 indicated that the benign tumors 
found in lab animals had "little relevance to man."  HCFC-123 is 
DuPont's replacement for R-11 since their operating characteristics 
are similar and the same lubricants can be used.

DuPont is now producing HFC-134a as its replacement for R-12 and
R-500 in centrifugal and screw chillers.  The product's ODP and GWP
are 0.0 and 0.28 compared with R-12's ODP OF 1.0 and its GWP of 3.0.

PARENTAL CELL DAMAGE MAY BE LINKED TO ALPHA RADIATION
EXPOSURE

The possibility that exposure to ionizing alpha radiation may damage
descendent human cells could help explain the "Gardner Phenomena,"
in which cases of children's leukemia are believed to have been
caused by father's employment at a British nuclear facility.
Scientists now have some reason to believe alpha radiation emitted
by radon and plutonium may be responsible for those chromosomal
abberations.

These findings, however, are extremely controversial because they
challenge traditional knowledge and involve scientists leaping from
one biological principle to another in order to make their case.

The scientists examining alpha radiation and its effects linked
leukemia among children to their fathers, who worked at a nuclear
fuel reprocessing plant. Research data indicate increased risk of
leukemia (six to eight times) in the offspring of fathers receiving
total radiation does of 100 millisieverts or greater prior to
conception.

From examining the results of laboratory tests, the researchers
believe they have found an unexpected mechanism associated with
alpha radiation -- chromosomal abberations which occur in an
apparently random fashion -- in descendent cells. The chromosomal
abberations shed new light on the potential damage alpha radiation
may cause.

"If a comparable phenomena could be demonstrated in spermatogonial
(sperm forming) stem cells," says researcher Eric Wright, "then it
is possible that a similar abberation could arise in sperm.

"Whilst our experiments don't actually address the Gardner
Phenomena," Wright says, "they do offer a biological mechanism
worth thinking about if you are going to take the alleged paternal
transmission of radiation damage seriously."  Wright is research
leader at the British Medical Research Council's Radiobiology Unit.

ADVISORY BOARD CRITICIZES EPA WATER GUIDELINES

Guidelines created by the U.S. EPA to assist public water utilities
dispose of wastes created during the radionuclide removal process
need more work, according to EPA's own Science Advisory Board
(SAB). The SAB Radiation Advisory Committee says it's worried
EPA's non-binding guidelines will "by default ... become the
standard."

According to committeeman Richard G. Sextro, in the absence of
"specific" federal regulations, EPA's guidelines for removing
radioactive wastes from treated drinking water will be viewed as a
standard and cause states to spend billions of dollars to comply.
Greg Helms of EPA's Office of Ground Water says the agency doesn't
have authority to "require" anything specific regarding disposal of
treated ground water waste.

A 27-member California congressional delegation says it disagrees
with EPA's proposed radon in water rule. In a letter to President
Bush, the group called EPA's proposed rule "very stringent and
costly," adding that the $3.7 billion compliance price tag will only
reduce "on average, about one percent of the public's total exposure
to radon according to EPA's Science Advisory Board." California
representatives asked Bush to direct EPA Administrator William
Reilly to conduct a full multi-media risk assessment in order to
produce a comprehensive cost effective radon reduction program for
the U.S.

The delegates also asked Bush to direct EPA to adopt a radon in
drinking water standard consistent with the goals of the Indoor
Radon Abatement Act of 1988.

ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT RADON TESTING AND MITIGATION

Recently I spoke at a radon meeting sponsored by the National Civic
League. A number of county health officials and neighborhood housing
groups were in attendance. The meetingTs purpose was to develop a
radon action plan designed to reach local communities. But, it
became clear early in the meeting that neither of these groups had a
very good grasp of basic radon fundamentals, nor were they
convinced there was a radon problem in their area.

I'm sure they aren't much different than any average American. Yes,
they've heard of radon, but radon is a problem in someone else's
home or neighborhood, not in their's.

EPA has been trying since 1988 to convince the public radon is a
serious health threat. Their efforts have probably made them feel
much like the "boy who cried wolf" because nobody seems to be
paying attention. Government officials have known the danger of
radon exposure for many years. In fact, in the early 1940's the U.S.
Public Health Service warned the Atomic Energy Commission about
radon and its threat to uranium miners. Unfortunately, the
Commission chose to ignore the warnings, and as taxpayers, we are
now compensating the miners' families for their exposure.

As you may know, radon didn't make headlines until it became a
"crisis" in the home of Stanley Watras. He and his family were
forced to vacate their house until their radon problem could be
corrected. When you stop to think about it, radon is still that way in
the majority of homes. Until someone moves, there is no radon
crisis, even if they know it is there!

My company has tested thousands of homes for radon. But more-
often-than-not, when home owners learn they have elevated levels
they usually don't take any action to lower their exposure. Initially
they might be concerned enough to start calling local "experts" until
they find someone who will calm their fears and tell them not to
worry. It seems the only time radon indeed becomes a crisis which
leads to action is when it comes time to sell a home. When sellers
become buyers, however, they are far more likely to insist on low
radon levels. Ironic? Perhaps. But, it's not such a bad situation,
because two houses get fixed as a result of the original transaction.

Radon isn't really much different than other health-related issues.
We generally don't do anything until we are forced to do so. Doctors
tell us we must lower our cholesterol, quit smoking, loose weight,
etc. or we may face the possibility of premature death. Look at the
change AIDS has brought to our society due to the tremendous fear
generated by public information. EPA took a lot of heat last year
over their public service ad campaign. The sad thing is the most
severe criticism of the campaign was due to a set of billboards
declaring "Radon is a Severe Risk in this Area" showing an X-Ray of
a pair of lungs. Some who saw the ads said they were "scared" the
visability of the ads would lower their property values. They could
care less, it seems, about the health risk radon poses.

I'm not a health physicist, but I do review a lot of scientific
information about radon that seems to validate the old adage "where
there is smoke, there is fire." Some researchers now believe radon
exposure may cause damage to genes that prevent tumors. Others
report possible links to leukemia, cancer of the liver, breast and
brain. I know there are those who will read these words and respond
with "show me the bodies." Although that evidence may be provided
in the future, until it is, we will just have to "smell the smoke."

When I was a small child, I can remember seeing ads with doctors
advertising Lucky Strikes and Chesterfields. When scientists began
raising the possibility that cigarette smoking might cause lung
cancer, other experts derided their research saying "prove it." But I
ask, where are those critics now?

The funny thing about radon is that the actions of one lawyer may be
saving more lives than the efforts of all health professionals
combined. Several years ago, Dick Mansfield, chief attorney for the
Employee Relocation Council, began evaluating environmental
pollutants. He issued a white paper in the late 1980's advising all
members of the relocation industry to test homes for radon before
taking them into inventory. He has since been criticized for that
decision but remains resolute in his position. Even though his
direction was designed to protect corporations against future
liability, the end result is that he may be responsible for saving
thousands of lives over the next decade or two. Ironic, isn't it, but
then again, pioneers always seem to get arrows in their backs.

NEW LANDAUER RELO PROGRAM RAISES MANY QUESTIONS

Despite less than favorable sales of radon detectors over the past
several years, Glenwood, Illinois-based Landauer, Inc. has reason to
be excited about radon. The AMEX-listed corporation recently rolled
out a new testing and mitigation program designed to help relocation
companies reduce administrative costs while increasing Landauer's
share of the radon detector market. According to company brochures,
the program would take the "corporation, relocation company,
transferee and real estate agent out of the testing and mitigation
process."

Landauer calls their new relocation marketing scheme the Home
Buyer's Preferred Radon Protection Program. It is a novel idea with
potential. In fact, at first glance, I'm sure it sounds very attractive
to relocation administrators, many of which are already
overburdened by increasing environmental concerns.

HERE'S HOW IT WORKS

The Landauer plan is sold as a service agreement provided by the
corporation or relocation company to the buyer at closing. After
closing is completed, Landauer sends the buyer a RADTRAK( alpha
track detector (manufactured by Landauer), which the buyer deploys
in the home, removing and returning it to Landauer after 120 days.
Landauer analyzes the device and provides results to the buyer, now
the owner of the home.

If levels of radon gas of 4 pCi/l or higher are detected by Landauer,
the home will be mitigated by a Landauer selected mitigator at no
cost to the buyer or relocation company. Landauer provides for post-
mitigation testing "to confirm the radon concentration has been
reduced to below 4 pCi/l."

WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

Company brochures tout Landauer's RADTRAK long-term  alpha track
detector as the type of test kit "recommended by the EPA," adding
that short-term tests "may produce a false positive or negative
resulting in unneccessary mitigation, or worse, an undetected health
hazard."

Landauer ought to know a lot about "false" test results. Remember
the Landauer Quick Screen( detector? That device, also touted by
the company as reliable, was sold all over the United States to an
unknown number of consumers and yet never managed to pass EPA
proficiency tests. In fact, according to officials with the company,
Landauer never bothered to alert those consumers who relied on the
Quick Screen that their test results might not be accurate. Some
states, like Pennsylvania, ordered the device off retail shelves and
out of the state.

In addition, Landauer's ability to provide accurate results have been
called into question once again. According to the EPA, the company's
most recent attempt to pass their alpha track detector through the
RMP failed. According to EPA staffers, Landauer has been "delisted"
from the U.S. EPA's RMP program for failing to pass the latest round
of blind tests. Will Landauer fail to notify recent RADTRAK
customers as well?

SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE

Although Landauer's program seems to be a great potential money-
maker for the company and its stockholders, it deserves scrutiny by
the radon and relocation industries.

For starters, it is commonly believed that the soon-to-be-released
"Home Buyer's and Seller's Guide to Radon" will not "recommend"
long-term test devices, but rather, short-term tests, when testing
is performed as a result of a real property transfer. As a major
player in the industry, Landauer  should have planned their marketing
materials to reflect this.

Second, Landauer shouldn't be in the radon business if they can't
meet EPA proficiency standards. That's just asking for trouble. And
not just for the company, but for the entire radon and relocation
industries. Negative media coverage of radon service companies like
Landauer, who fail to meet EPA criteria, yet continue to offer
services to the public, can damage the credibility of the entire radon
industry, giving the public another reason not to test or mitigate.

Third, Landauer's plan, although perfectly legal, leaves its
customers open to intense scrutiny, and perhaps, liability. Although
Landauer's Brett Ladda describes the program as "no different than
going to the doctor" (Landauer provides the test, analyzes it,
remediates if necessary and then provides a confirmatory test and
results, similar to physicians who both examine patients and
prescribe treatment), the plan does not provide enough details to be
attractive to the relocation industry. For instance, who will audit
the test results? How can homeowners be assured that Landauer
devices will detect radon without a confirmatory reading from an
independent firm of their choice? What does Landauer know about
mitigation? What experience do they have mitigating homes? How
will they ensure their "network" of mitigation contractors will
actually do the job right -- and that their work will meet EPA
standards? And, perhaps more importantly, do they guarantee their
work?

A GOOD IDEA, BUT POORLY PLANNED

Although the concept of the Landauer plan is not such a bad idea
from a consumer savings point of view, choosing Landauer for
anything radon-related could be a mistake for a corporation or
relocation company. It's a public relations disaster waiting to
happen. For instance, if one of Landauer's RADTRAK detectors were
discovered to have performed poorly, the media would first point to
Landauer as "the fox guarding the henhouse," comparing the
company's service agreements with those currently under fire
between physicians, insurance companies and home health care
providers.

Good reporters would then do a "history" of Landauer, pointing out
the company's size, revenues, other business dealings,  the Quick
Screen fiasco and the company's current delisting. Landauer and its
clients would be portrayed in a negative light.

The way I see it, Landauer has two options. One -- Landauer could
stop pretending to be a radon service company.  After passing EPA
proficiency tests, Landauer could begin making improvements to its
plan to make it more marketable.

Two -- Landauer could drop out of the radon testing and mitigation
industry altogether.  The companyTs error-ladden radon efforts are
nothing but a liability. Its past record speaks for itself. Today,
Landauer is still attempting to sell its new testing and mitigation
plan to a fictional corporate America . They call the plan "the no
hassles solution to radon" -- as if hassles top the corporate
relocation gripe list. In the real world of radon and relocation,
liability is of more concern. And, liability concerns can only be put
to rest when all environmental defects have been disclosed. Without
addressing disclosure, the Landauer plan falls short of "preferred"
and offers little "protection" to anyone.

DOW CORNING HALTS SALE OF "FIRE STOP"

Dow Corning recently withdrew its "Fire Stop Intumescent Wrap
Strip 2002" from the market. Recent testing of the wrap strip
revealed what the company calls "some performance limitations"
which develop as the product ages.

Dow Corning says it will no longer sell the product and advises
contractors and suppliers to return all unused wrap strip for
replacement. The company is looking into whether or not retrofits
will be necessary "in homes where Dow Corning Wrap Strip
previously had been installed."

BOWSER-MORNER OPENS NEW CALIBRATION FACILITY

Bowser-Morner, Inc., an independent, accredited testing facility in
Dayton, Ohio, has opened a commercial radon calibration laboratory
the company says is identical to the chambers used by the U.S. EPA
in size, air flow, temperature, humidity controls, radon source,
monitoring methods and equipment.

The lab's quality assurance program features periodic data
comparisons with both EPA environmental laboratories in
Montgomery, Alabama and Las Vegas, Nevada; and the Department of
Energy's Environmental Measurements Laboratory in New York.

Editor's Note: Commercialcalibration facilities calibrate
measurement devices for radon service providers. The quality of
calibrations conducted for radon service providers affects the
accuracy of radon measurement results provided to consumers

ATTORNEYS SAY IAQ LITIGATION GROWING FAST

According to attorneys interviewed by Indoor Air Quality Update
(IAQU), the courts have seen a tremendous increase in indoor air
quality (IAQ) lawsuits. The attorneys say as plaintiffs' interest in
IAQ lawsuits rise, so too will the interest and attention of the
design and construction industries.

Attorneys interviewed by the monthly trade journal say that
although many past lawsuits have centered around residential
pollutants, the focus is now shifting. In the future, they predict,
more and more IAQ lawsuits will center on commerical, industrial
and multi-family residential properties.

Building designers, construction contractors and building operators,
attorneys say, should ensure the safety of their tenants by testing
for the presence of all possible known contaminants and routinely
inspecting HVAC systems for problems.

Frank Cross, author of "Legal Responses to Indoor Air Pollution"
says, "Most building managers are hesitant to do this, in part,
because they may not want to know, and in part because they don't
want to unnecessarily alarm their tenants. "But if they want to
avoid future litigation," Cross told IAQU, "this (testing and HVAC
inspections) could make a big difference."

FAMILY PET MAY BE "WATCH DOG" FOR ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS

Man's best friend might also be his best doctor. "The family dog and
other pets can be ideal sentinels of health hazards in your
environment," says researcher Dr. Lawrence T. Glickman of Purdue
University's School of Veternary Medicine. "Now, for the first time,
a state health department is considering using animals to help
identify human diseases caused by environmental factors, in hopes
of spotting health problems before they happen or diagnosing them
when they do."

North Carolina is considering such a system, following a May
conference at which Glickman and other public-health experts
explored the possibility.

Glickman and Dr. Ralph C. Richardson, also of the Purdue School of
Veternary Medicine, say using animals as health sentinels has
several advantages.

"Pets are ideal health sentinels because they intimately share the
same environment as their owners and often eat the same things,"
says Glickman, an epidemiologist and head of the Department of
Veternary Pathobiology.

Richardson, professor of small animal medicine and oncology and
head of Purdue's Department of Veternary Clinical Sciences, says,
"Dogs acquire diseases sooner because of their shorter lifespans.
This gives us a chance to perhaps figure out why a disease develops,
thereby allowing owners to take preventative measures for
themselves and for the other animals in the environment."

Two years ago Glickman chaired the National Academy of Sciences'
Committee on   Animals as Monitors of Environmental Hazards,
which reviewed and evaluated the usefulness of animal studies in
assessing health risks for people.

The committee found that although many scientists view animal
sentinels as valuable indicators of environmental hazards, the
approach has not been widely accepted. Part of the reason, Glickman
says, is that such studies rely on epidemiology as the basic tool, and
that the science is relatively new. Epidemiology is the study of how
disease develops and spreads into a population.

Another reason, Glickman says, is that many government funding
agencies are unaware of the value of such animal studies. "But I
hope that the report might help legitimize this approach," he says.

The committee published its report last summer. One of the group's
recommendations was to require the reporting of environmentally
caused animal diseases to appropriate state or federal agencies,
which would allow the data collected to be shared with public health
officials.

"It's done for infectious diseases like rabies, so it just makes sense
to do it for something like bladder cancer, which can affect people,
too," Glickman notes.

The report also recommended making the best use of animal-
exposure and disease record systems via computer not only for
companion animals and livestock, but also fish and wildlife. In
addition, the report noted more and more veternary and biological
sciences schools are offering courses and graduate programs in
epidemiology, with an  emphasis on environmental health.

Glickman has done several animal-sentinel studies, including one on
breast cancer and diet in dogs. Another study linked bladder cancer
in dogs to owners' using flea and tick dips on the animals and living
near areas sprayed with insecticides.

Glickman also is part of a Purdue study of dogs to assess their
owners' exposure to radon gas in the home. The first phase of the
research involved attaching radon detection collars to about 30 pet
dogs in Tippecanoe County, Indiana, to measure home radon levels.
Phase one has been completed and researchers hope to obtain funding
for phase two, which will compare radon levels in homes of dogs
with lung cancer and a control group without cancer from the same
neighborhood.

Purdue's Comparative Oncology Program, which seeks novel and
effective ways to treat animals afflicated with cancer, includes a
tumorregistry of tissue samples suspected of being cancerous.
The programTs most recent work on animals as human health
sentinels found owners of dogs with cancer used 2, 4-D herbicide on
their lawns and/or used a lawn-care company about one-third more
often than did owners of dogs without the disease. Maligant
lymphoma in dogs is very similar to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in
people. 2, 4-D also is one of the components in Agent Orange, the
defoliant used during the Vietnam War.

"We definitely want to help animals with better diagnosis and
treatment," says Richardson. "But the dream is to use animals that
may have been exposed to environmental hazards as sentinels for
how cancer develops in people."

CARBON MONOXIDE, BACKDRAFTING ISSUES ADDRESSED

There is a risk of carbon monoxide poisoning in any building with
fuel burning equipment. In some buildings this risk is essentially nil,
such as houses that use electricity for home and water heating,
clothes drying, and cooking and that do not have attached garages
where gasoline engines may be operated. In other buildings, the risk
of carbon monoxide poisoning is also very low, such as houses with
newer, high-efficiency, closed-combustion furnaces, boilers, or
water heaters. However, the overwhelming majority of houses have
boilers, fireplaces, furnaces and water heaters that use house air to
support combustion and depend upon traditional chimneys or flues to
vent combustion products to the outdoors. When combustion products
spill into the house (backdraft), the potential for carbon monoxide
poisoning is established.

Unfortunately, many conventional boilers, fireplaces, furnaces and
water heaters spill combustion products into the home. Spillage
commonly occurs during the first minute or two of ignition until the
chimney is sufficiently warm to draw combustion products to the
top. The longer the spillage occurs, the greater the risk. Complete
spillage may result from several causes: a blocked chimney, a
disconected flue, a cracked heat exchanger, or an insufficient
amount of air to support the draft up the chimney. The latter
condition occurs when the combustion appliance is located in a
space that is under negative pressure (depressurized) relative to the
outdoors. The amount of depressurization depends on the air-
tightness of the space containing the combustion appliance and the
capacity of other exhaust devices as well as duct design and leakage
in forced-air heating/cooling systems.

Fortunately, carbon monoxide is usually found in very small
concentrations in combustion gases from properly maintained
furnaces, boilers and water heaters. However, when combustion is
starved for oxygen, an atom of oxygen is stripped from carbon
dioxide (CO2, a common combustion byproduct) and carbon monoxide
(CO) is produced.

WHAT'S THE RISK OF CO POISONING?

Several hundred people die from carbon monoxide produced by
combustion appliances in the home each year. Several thousand
additional people have less dramatic symptoms of carbon monoxide
poisoning (headaches, nausea, shortness of breath) although not all
the symptoms may be attributed to carbon monoxide.

WHO SHOULD BE CONCERNED?

Any contractor, tradesperson, inspector, or sponsor who makes
modification of ventilation rates in houses should be concerned
about combustion spillage. This includes those who: install exhaust
fans and devices, modify HVAC systems, and/or modify airtightness
of buildings or install mitigation systems. Mitigation contractors
have been alerted to this concern since 1986 by the New York State
Energy Office (NYSEO) and, since 1988 by the U.S. EPA. These alerts
cited previous guidance directed to low-income weatherization
providers and other contractors by the U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE). Portions of DOE's guidance reflect tests required by building codes.

WHICH TEST IS BEST?

First, any of the described tests is better than none. Second, each
test is like a tool -- one may fit a specific radon mitigator in a
situation better than another contractor in another situation. Select
the test that best fits your situation (understanding limitations),
conduct it, document and report it.

WHY NOT PROVIDE CLIENT WITH A DETECTOR?

Passive carbon monoxide detectors are available for about $3.
However, there are several concerns about such detectors: first, the
minimum sensitivity of such detectors may be above the threshold
of health effects; second, the detectors must periodically be
replaced (for example, every month); and third, the detector requires
a significant CO exposure that may not be discovered by the occupant
in time.

WHAT ABOUT HEAT-SENSITIVE DETECTORS?

These devices are probably fine as a back-up but are not a substitute
for spillage testing when working on a house. Such detectors require
the client to monitor the detector.

WHY NOT MEASURE CARBON DIOXIDE NEAR COMBUSTION APPLIANCES
TO DETECT SPILLAGE?

If you have a carbon dioxide monitor (several hundred to several
thousand dollars) or hand pump and detector tubes (several hundred
dollars), you can measure for it. For most radon mitigation, an
inexpensive smoke bottle will be adequate to test for spillage associated with
depressurization (conditions may be related to radon mitigation). Of course, a
carbon dioxide test may reflect other defects (e.g. cracked heat exchanger) not
related to radon.

WHY NOT USE A BLOWER DOOR TO CHECK SPILLAGE?

A blower door is a great diagnostic tool in the hands of a skilled
operator, especially for advanced indoor air quality work. If you use
a blower door and understand interzonal analysis, use your blower
door in your spillage checks. However, a blower door is not a
requirement for testing for backdrafting.

WHO HAS DIED FROM CO DUE TO RADON MITIGATION?

The best available evidence suggests about 10 percent of houses
with conventional combustion appliances have unacceptable spillage
due to depressurization. Most radon mitigation increases
depressurization. A brief test for spillage, requiring several minutes
by an EPA-approved conractor, is not unreasonable. No EPA-approved
contractor should reduce one environmental health risk while increasing
another.

GIVE ME A SIMPLE CHECKLIST SO I CAN GUARANTEE I'LL NEVER HAVE
A PROBLEM.

There are simple procedures and checklists to help you test for
spillage, as previously identified. However, there is not any one test
that will ensure future maintenance and use of combustion
appliances. Thus, it is unclear how a reasonable person could expect
or offer an
unconditional guarantee.

ADDITIONAL SOURCES FOR BACKDRAFTING INFORMATION

* National Fuel Gas Code, Appendix H (pages 2223.1-89), 1988,
"Recommended Procedures for Safety Inspection of an Existing
Appliance Installation." This procedure includes a combustion
appliance spillage test (at the draft hood using smoke) while
exterior windows and doors, fireplace dampers, and the door
between the combustion appliance and the remainder of the house
are closed and exhaust fans and devices are operated.

* American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning
Engineers, ASHRE Standard 62-1989, Appendix B, "Positive
Combustion Air Supply." This procedure includes combustion spillage
testing involving measuring the ratio of dilution air in the stack
above the draft hood (40 percent minimum) under "closed house"
conditions and with all commonly used exhaust fans and devices
operated. This test should not be performed when the inside-outside
temperature difference is more the 30 degrees farenheit (18 degrees
celsius) or wind velocity is more than 5 mph (2.2 m/s).

* "Procedure for Determining the Safety of Residential Chimneys"
in Chimney Safety Test User's Manual (Second Edition) prepared for
the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CHMC) by Scanada -
Sheltair Consortium (January 12, 1988). This document outlines a
two-step procedure: the first step involves a simple paper
excercise; and, if necessary, a more rigorous "worst case
simulation" test using pressure measurement in spaces containing
combustion devices as well as spillage tests.

* "Worst Case Draft Test"  required by the Minnesota Department of
Jobs and Training, St. Paul, MN., for all weatherization contractors
using state administered federal funds. This procedure outlines a
simple pressure measurement in flues under "closed house"
conditions and with all commonly used exhaust fans and devices
operating.

* "Retrofit Ventilation System Guide," 1991 (November), Energy
Conservatory, Minneapolis, MN., for blower door operators. This
procedure outlines an indoor air quality strategy involving
combustion spillage tests using simple equipment and procedures.
Radon mitigation contractors may wish to check with local HVAC
inspectors, HVAC contractors, or low-income weatherization
providers about these or similar procedures. Each procedure has
advantages and disadvantages that should be considered.

FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS HALT BOGUS AIR FILTER CLAIMS

"Phototron" indoor greenhouse claimed to remove everything,
including radon and pet odors.

Phototron indoor greenhouse isn't all it's cracked up to be. At least,
that's the opinion of investigators at the Federal Trade Commission
(FTC), who charge that San Diego-based Pyraponic Industries II, Inc.
and it's owner, Jeffery Julian DeMarco, made false and
unsubstantiated claims that their "Phototron" indoor air cleaner
would remove all indoor air contaminants.

According to the FTC, Pyraponic ran advertisements in a variety of
national magazines claiming it's "Phototron natural home air
purifier" would remove "radon, formaldehyde, pet odors, kitchen and
bathroom smells, cigarette smoke" and, at the same time,
"replentish oxygen 33 times, along with the fresh scent of the
plants of your choice." Furthermore, the ads claimed a Phototron
could eliminate all pollutants in a 1,000 square foot area.

FTC staffers agreed to a consent decree to settle the charges with
Pryaponic, which prohibits the firm from representing in the future
that its products remove all indoor air contaminants.

The decree also requires the company's future ads be based on
"competent and reliable scientific evidence supporting its claims
that Phototron is a viable substitute, or is superior to, any other air
cleaning products, or is effective within a specific size area."

A January 1992 General Accounting Office report makes it clear
misrepresentation and public manipulation in the air and water
filtration and treatment industries is occuring. The report warns
consumers that disjointed regulation of these emerging industries
has left the door open for unscrupulous businesspersons.

Policing air and water cleaning systems is something the FTC does
under its "Green Claims" category. FTC staffers say complaints that
focus on a company's attempt to take advantage of public concern
about the environment are becoming more common.  Several claims
have been made to date by the FTC against water and air purification
companies.

Editor's Note: Consent agreements (decrees) are for
settlement purposes only and are not an admission of
participation in an unlawful act. Consent orders carry the force of
law, once finalized by the agency, with respect to future
actions. Violations can result in fines as high as $10,000.

For more information contact the FTC at (202) 326-2161.

RADON HAS ITS DAY IN MARYLAND COURT

In the Spring 1992 issue of RND, we reported the story of a
Baltimore, Maryland tenant who broke her lease after discovering
her rental home had an indoor radon level of 9 pCi/l.

The renter, Nina Bingham, moved out of the home immediately after
discovering the elevated radon level and was sued by the owner of
the rental unit for past rent, damages and legal fees.

Unfortunately for Bingham, her lease agreement did not include a
provision (relating to radon or other indoor air pollutants) for
breaking the lease, the judge reluctantly sided with the property
owner, ruling that Bingham did not follow proper protocol for
breaking a lease in the State of Maryland.

Cindy Scott Hibert, a producer at WMAR TV Channel 2 in Baltimore,
the station which originally reported on the  story, told RND "the
problem with Nina was that she didn't follow the proper steps. If she
just would have followed our county statutes -- which require
proper return of keys, notification, and  the establishment of an
escrow account for rent payments -- the judge would have ruled in
her favor."

Hilbert, a licensed attorney, says  the most  interesting twist to
this emotional story is that the realtor who arranged the lease
produced a document releasing Bingham from it.

"Unfortunately, Nina didn't want to sign it," Hilbert says. "She
should have."

Hilbert says although the judge determined an elevated radon level
does pose a health risk to Bingham and her children, he had no legal
grounds to support his personal feeling that Bingham had done the
right thing.

"I'm just praying that a tenant (with an elevated radon level in a
leased property) will come forward and follow the law as it regards
breaking leases.

"Breaking a lease for reasons of elevated radon is possible (in
Maryland, or elsewhere) if it is done so by the books," Hilbert says.

"I can't wait," she added. "Then we'll really see some changes."

Editor's Note: Our original story was based, in part, on an article
reported in the Midwest AARST Radon Reporter. The  article reported
Bingham had won the case, which she did, until a motion by the
plaintiff's attorney forced the judge to rule against Bingham for
improperly breaking her lease.

CERCLA: EPA ISSUES RULE ON LENDER LIABILITY

The U.S. EPA's long-awaited rule on lender liability was published in
the Federal Register, April 29, 1992 (57 Fed Reg 18344). The rule
provides protections to lenders from  contamination they are
innocent of causing.

The rule was issued to clarify statutory phrases in the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Liability and Compensation
Act (CERCLA), pertaining to property ownership and liability for
pollution cleanup.

The "security interest exemption," as defined by EPA, specifies the
range of activities which may be conducted by an entity/person who
maintains  "indicia" ownership of a facility for security interests -
- without such activities being deemed "participation" in managing
the secured  property.

The resulting EPA final rule adopts a new test for "participation." In
brief, a lender participates in property management only if the
lender either exercises decision-making control over environmental
compliance issues on the property, or, where the actions of the
lender create or assume responsibility for the day-to-day operations
of the property. The agency also determined that a government
lender, receiver or conservator  which involuntarily aquires a
contaminated property is entitled to "innocent landowner" third-
party defense provided under CERCLA Section 101 (35)(a)(ii) and
(107)(B)(3).

According to environmental attorneys interviewed by RND, a
government entity, not-for-profit organization or university, for
example, which acquired a property as a gift, would qualify for the
innocent landowner defense. Under CERCLA there are three defenses
under which a property holder may be absolved of liability. If the
pollution was caused by 1) an act of a third-party with whom the
property holder has no contractual relationship; 2) an act of God; or
3) an act of War.

Although radon gas is listed  in the Hazardous Waste Regulations (40
CFR 302.4)(Appendix B), environmental attorneys say they aren't
clear whether or not radon is actually a CERCLA issue.
"Theoretically," one attorney  says,"itTs a CERCLA issue. But, a
lender making a residential loan probably wouldn't be concerned
about radon.

Nevertheless, lenders should be concerned about radon. They'll want
to do their environmental due dilligence upfront, whether they are
required to do so by law or not."

Editor's Note: EPA has classified radon as a "Class A" carcinogen.

HOME BUYER'S AND SELLER'S GUIDE TO RADON: REVIEW

Draft copy yields variety of responses; comments shed light on
concerns.

There has been much speculation as to what the soon-to-be-released
EPA "Home Buyer's and Seller's Guide to Radon" will advise. The
purpose of the guide, according to EPA, is to help both home buyer's
and seller's become informed about radon and its dangers, learn how
to test a home and, should it be necessary, determine the best way
to remediate.

A draft copy of the "Real Estate Guide" (October 1991) along with
interviews with EPA officials reveals some of the agency's possible
recommendations for radon testing during a real property transfer.
EPA advises buyers of homes that have already been tested for radon
to "select your own professional radon contractor." In addition, the
agency instructs buyers to find out: 1) The results of the previous
test, 2) Who conducted it, and, 3) Where in the house the test was
performed.

Buyers of homes that have not previously been tested for radon are
advised to: 1) Make sure a radon test is done as soon as possible, 2)
"Work with the seller to arrange testing," 3) Make sure the test is
conducted on the lowest level in which the buyer intends to use.
In addition, the draft includes sections on test results and what they
mean, radon in water, remediation, selecting a mitigator, EPA's RMP
program, radon myths and a copy of the risk chart from the"Citizen's
Guide".

INDUSTRY COMMENTS

As usual, many radon industry members submitted comments to EPA
expressing their concerns about the contents of the draft "Real
Estate Guide". Many of these concerns were expressed in the review
comments submitted by the radon industry via the American
Association of Radon Scientists and Technologists (AARST). Some of
these concerns are detailed in the following

AARST COMMENTS.

AARST recommends that EPA change the words "lowest living area"
to "lowest liveable area" before finalizing the document. AARST
reviewers say the "lowest living area" instruction (contained in the
draft) does not provide enough direction for the buyer of a real
property, which may result in a "grey area" in need of
interpretation. In many cases, AARST reviewers say, a buyer of a
home relies on a real estate agent to interpret these unclear issues.

Real estate agents, the reviewers say, have a vested interest in
making certain that radon results are low and that his/her
interpretation of what constitutes the "lowest living area" may not
be in the best interest of the buyer.

Instead of following EPA's lead, AARST reviewers offer several
"good" reasons for continuing the "lowest liveable area" approach.
The basement, according to one EPA  contractor, can be easily and
consistently maintained under closed house conditions. This
measurement location gives the most consistent readings in both
summer and winter. Confirmation of results, he says, is more
consistent, thus avoiding the confusion of the larger measurement
variations found during first floor testing.

As an interesting twist, results of an informal survey of AARST
members also was provided to EPA. The survey found that most radon
industry leaders believe the "lowest liveable area" of a home should
be tested at a minimum. A majority of those surveyed said they
believe that both the "lowest liveable area" and "lowest living
area" should be tested simultaneously.

Sixty-seven percent of those polled said they support a single
measurement period with duplicate measurements versus 36 percent
who said they would support a recommended follow-up test.

According to EPA's Rita Hoyt, the draft guide currently is undergoing
an internal review. The agency hopes to release the final version of
the "Home Buyer's and Seller's Guide to Radon" this fall.

DRAFT EPA RADON TESTING PROTOCOLS

The following is taken from a draft version of EPA's "Buyer's and
Seller's Guide to Radon." These are NOT the finalized radon testing
protocols for real estate transactions. Draft documents are
presented here for your review. Please be sure to check with the EPA
before making decisions based on information contained in any
government document draft. EPA says it expects to release the final
document later this fall.

TESTING PROTOCOL ONE

Protocol 1(a). Take a short-term test.
Protocol 1(b). If your results are 4 pCi/l or higher, take a follow-up
short-term test to be sure.

MITIGATION OPTIONS

Under protocol 1 (a) or (b): Fix the home if the average of the first
and second tests is 4 pCi/l or more.

TESTING PROTOCOL TWO

Protocol 2. Take two short-term tests at the same time.

MITIGATION OPTIONS

Under protocol 2: Fix the home if the average of the two tests is 4
pCi/l or more.

TESTING PROTOCOL THREE

Protocol 3. Test the home with a continuous monitor for at least 48
hours -- preferably longer.

MITIGATION OPTIONS

Under protocol 3: Fix the home if the average radon level is 4 pCi/l
or more.

RADON TEST DEVICE PLACEMENT

According to a recent EPA draft, the testing device(s) should be
placed in the lowest level of the home suitable for occupancy. For
example, the basement, if it is used frequently. If you are the seller,
and currently not using the basement, you may still want to test the
basement if it could be used by a buyer without renovations. The test
should be conducted in a room used regularly (like a living room, play
room, den or bedroom, but not a kitchen or bath).

In selecting a testing option, you may want to consider factors such
as cost, accuracy, availability of tamper-resistant features, and
how soon you can get test results. Your State Radon Office can help
you decide which option is best for you.

EPA "GEOLOGICAL PROBABILITY OF ELEVATED INDOOR RADON" MAP
DISTRIBUTED, CRITICIZED

Attendees of the National Association of Counties annual meeting in
Minneapolis, Minnesota this past July, received  draft copies of the
U.S. EPA's "Geological Probability of Elevated Indoor Radon" map.

The map is designed to reflect NURE data, as well as radon testing
data from both EPA and U.S. Geologic Surveys.

The map, still in draft form, is a political football, some government
insiders say, because it is highly generalized and fails to provide
enough specific data.

Several state radon program directors say they agree. "The
usefulness of the map (to the public), is not very great," says one
program director whose opinion seems to be shared by several
others interviewed by RND. Program directors who have seen the
draft, say the map is better than nothing, but needs some improvement before
being released to the public.

Local and state government representatives say they have made
their concerns about the map known to EPA, but says one, "we're not
sure they'll do anything to address our concerns."

Mike Hanson of the Ohio Geologic Survey says the map leaves
something to be desired. For instance, Hanson says, in some areas,
where we know 60 percent of the homes are likely to have elevated
radon levels of 4-20 pCi/l, the map says otherwise.

Another problem is that the map is based on "lowest liveable space"
readings. States are concerned their test databases would become
obsolete because of new protocols in the Citizen's Guide.

RADON LEGISLATION AND RELOCATION PROPERTY TRANSFERS

National, state and local radon legislation reviewed

As the downturn in the U.S. economy continues, every corporate
department is under pressure to reduce costs and relocation is no
exception. Some companies are reducing relocation costs by
transferring fewer employees and all are carefully scrutinizing
their relocation policy for cost-cutting opportunities. In the past
several months, I have been asked whether there have been any
recent events that would justify saving money by eliminating radon
tests. The answer to the question is an uncategorical "no." In fact,
there has been a spate of recent state and federal legislation
designed to encourage radon testing and awareness.

STATE LEGISLATION

The following is a list of radon legislation compiled by the
Conference of Radiation Control, an association of state and local
radiation control programmers showing both proposed and enacted
legislation in the 18 states in which the issue has come before the
legislature (as of February 1992).

California -- AB765, Chapter 1.5. Establishes requirements for the
certification of radon measurement laboratories, radon testing and
consulting specialists, and radon mitigation contractors.

Connecticut -- Sec. 19a-14b, General Statutes. Requires any
company that performs testing or mitigation to be certified by the
state, and mandates publication of a list of these companies.
S.234. Addresses radon hazards in schools.

District of Columbia -- Proposed "Indoor Safe Air Act." Would
establish procedures for testing and abatement of radon gas and
radon progeny in District of Columbia buildings.

Illinois -- HB1611, The Radon Testing Act.
Authorizes the Department of Environment to establish a
registration program for individuals and companies that test for
radon.

HB 2709, The Radon Mitigation Act. This is basically an omnibus act,
authorizing the Department of Environment to conduct a wide range
of activities including surveys, public education programs, and other
radon-related activities.

Indiana -- IC 13-1-14. Authorizes rules to establish and operate
programs for the certification of individuals engaged in testing for
radon gas in buildings and in soil, and the abatement of radon gas in
buildings.

Iowa -- Chapter 136B of the Iowa Code. Mandates that persons who
do testing and mitigation be certified by the state. Establishes
requirements for reporting test results on non-public buildings, and
outlines department spot-check validity measurements and
reporting procedures.

Kansas -- Proposed HB 2408. Would require state certification of
persons providing devices or services related to radon testing and
mitigation.

Maine -- Chapter 165 Revised Statutes Annotated, Title 22, sec. 771
et seq. Establishes a program to register firms and individuals
involved with radon testing, consulting, or other remedial services
to ensure accurate radon testing, to encourage safe and effective
mitigation of dangerous radon levels, and to protect property
owners from unqualified or unscrupulous vendors.

Massachusetts -- Proposed HB 548. Would establish requirements
for persons testing and mitigating radon. Would require that a
radon test be done by the seller of any residential dwelling and
would require pertinent information about the test be made
available to a prospective buyer.

Proposed HB 2099. Would require any peron who tests for and
mitigates radon to be certified by the state and to file timely
reports.

Proposed HB 3160. Would provide a tax credit for testing and
abatement of radon gas.

New Hampshire -- RSA 125:9. States that the director of the
Division of Public Health Services shall conduct inspections of all
buildings and dwellings, upon request, for the presence of radon or
other health hazards present in indoor air. Provides education,
technical consultation, and recommendations for abatement of such
health hazards in conjunction with the University of New Hampsire
cooperative extension service.

RSA 477:4a. States that, prior to the execution of any contract for
the purchase and sale of any interest in real propoerty that includes
a building, the seller or the seller's agent shall provide notice to the
buyer that radon may be found in some areas of New Hampshire.

New Jersey -- PL 1985, Chapter 408. Establishes a state radon
program.

PL 1986, Chapter 83. Establishes a certification program for radon
testers and mitigators.

PL 1989, Chapter 189. Mandates that new
construction be tested for radon.

New York -- S. 6496, A. 8594. Directs the State Energy Office to
develop and implement a radon diagnosis assistance program and
promote radon remediation actions in at least one of every four
family residences with elevated radon levels. Also establishes
research grants for not-for-profit organizations.

S. 7690, A. 9978. Provides financial assistance for the performance
of radon diagnostic services and the preparation of specifications
for appropriate, energy-efficicient mitigation measures for one- to
four-family residences with elevated radon levels.

S. 9594, A. 11717. Directs the State Energy Office to develop and
implement a radon detection, public information, and technical
assistance program, to further energy conservation and assist and
promote radon remediation.

Ohio -- Am. Susb. HB 279. Establishes a state program for
licensure of individuals and businesses involved in radon
testing and mitigation activities, and requires the Public Health
Council to establish rules regarding the licensing program;
requires the Director of Health to administer and enforce the
program in accordance with the Public Health Council's rules;
establishes civil and criminal penalties for violation of laws and
rules governing radon licensure; and establishes a standard of
liability for license holders.

Pennsylvania -- SB 857. Authorizes low-interest loans for
radon gas mitigation and appropriation.

HB 687. Provides personal income tax credits for expenses
incurred for home radon-reduction projects.

HB 956. Requires radon testing and notification before certain real
property transactions, and provides a remedy for failure to do so.

HB 2001. Requires radon testing and notification for sale of
residential property; imposes administrative penalties; and
imposes powers and duties on the Department of Environmental
Resources.

Rhode Island. Has proposed an act that would authorize the Director
of Health to promulgate regulations and conduct programs related to
radon control. The act would also create a state radon trust fund.

Virginia -- Section 32.2-299 A.1. Provides for a program of
education and technical assistance related to radon.

Section 32.1-299 A.2. Requires the State Department of Health to
make available the U.S. EPA Radon Mitigator Proficiency (RMP) and
Radon Contractor Proficiency (RCP) lists.

Section 32.1. Requires that persons screening, testing or mitigating
radon be listed as proficient by EPA.

Washington -- SHB 2662. Authorizes the certification of person who
perform radon gas or radon progeny measurements, including sample
collection, analysis, or interpretation of such measurements, and of
those who perform radon mitigation of buildings for radon gas or
radon progeny; and authorizes fees for certification.

SHB 1535. An act relating to radon testing required by the State
Building Code Council.

Wisconsin -- Act 399. Authorizes the development and
dissemination of radon information, and the coordination of a
program to measure radon gas, perform home surveys, develop
training materials, and conduct training classes.

Most of the aforementioned legislation concerns certification or
licensing of companies engaged in testing for, or mitigation of,
radon. It is likely that the majority of states will have this type of
legislation in place within the next few years. Licensing and
registration of testers and mitigators is a positive change for
relocation because it upgrades the overall quality of testers and
remediators and identifies a pool of qualified companies available to
the relocation administrator.

It is more difficult to predict whether more states will enact
mandatory testing and/or disclosure statutes. However, given the
increasingly broad court interpretations of the duty to disclose, the
National Association of Realtors' recommendation that its state
members propose and lobby for state disclosure laws, and current
federal legislation (discussed below), it is likely that a substantial
number of states will enact radon testing and disclosure legislation
in the coming years.

The significance of state laws to the relocation administrator is
that such legislation may conflict with a company's relocation
policies in some way. In all cases to date, state requirements with
respect to testing and disclosure are minimum standards, and there
is nothing wrong in exceeding them. For example, a company may
decide to require mitigation as well as disclosure of test results.
However, varying state laws necessitate that a company's radon
policy also vary according to the state from which the employee is
transferred.

FEDERAL LEGISLATION

For the past several years, I have been reporting on bills
introduced before the U.S. House and Senate on the subject of radon.
Few have been voted on. On March 10 of this year, the Senate passed
S. 792, a reauthorization of the Indoor Radon Abatement Act of
1988, known as the Indoor Radon Abatement Reauthorization Act of
1991. This very comprehensive bill is likely to be modified in
conference, should the House pass its radon bill, H.R. 3258, the
"Radon Awareness and Disclosure Act." The House bill has not come
up for a vote as of the date this article was written, but is expected
to pass if the House is able to vote on it in this an election year.

Among the provision of S. 792 of interest to relocation:

1) Federally mandates the EPA's development of a "Home Buyer's and
Seller's Guide to Radon," a document specifically aimed at the real
estate process. As with the "Citizen's Guide to Radon," E-R-C and
other organizations have been working with and advising EPA on the
content of this document for more than a year. The current draft
presently is undergoing review by the administrator of EPA. (Editor's
Note: EPA staffers say the document should be released sometime
this fall.)

2) The "CitizenTs Guide to Radon" is described in the legislation.
This guide already has been completed.

3) The bill requires that "every original mortgage institution"
provide the "Home Buyer's and Seller's Guide to Radon" to each
person "from whom it receives or for whom it prepares a written
application for an applicable mortgage loan." In addition, it bars
federally chartered secondary mortgage institutions from
purchasing any loans in which this requirement has not been met.
The application for a mortgage usually is made after the contract of
sale is signed by the buyer. In order to reduce pressure to amend
contracts based on the warnings in this brochure, it is likely that
real estate agents will begin making the booklets available at or
before the signing of the contracts, should this part of the bill be
adopted into law.

4) The bill also provides for federal radon disclosure. Any
residential dwelling or multi-unit structure owned by the federal
government or any government corporation located in a high priority
radon area (as defined below) will have to be tested prior to the
contract of sale, and the results of that test disclosed to the
potential buyer.

5) The bill requires EPA to come up with a list of high priority radon
areas, based on indoor radon test results and geology. The country
would be divided into three such zones, each ranking the likelihood
of finding indoor radon. However, EPA will not change its
recommendation that all homes, regardless of their location, be
tested. See Radon Map page 11.

6) EPA, in conjunction with other agencies, will be required to
devise model construction standards for radon resistant housing. All
federally assisted housing, and federal office and other structures
are to be built using this technology in high priority radon areas.

The remainder of the bill contains outreach, research, and disclosure
provisions, all of which are designed to increase radon awareness
among the general public and encourage testing and disclosure.

EPA ACTIVITIES

Regardless of whether any federal legislation is passed this year,
EPA will continue to carry out its mandate under the 1988 Act to
provide information to the public on the dangers of indoor radon
pollution and its elimination. EPA's Radon Division currently has a
number of projects underway. The ones most directly affecting
relocation are the publication of the previously mentioned "Citizen's
Guide to Radon" and the "Home Buyer's and Seller's Guide to Radon."

In addition, it has begun programs to provide information and grants
to state radiation control departments, to perform research on radon
testing and mitigation, to perform research and devise recommended
model building codes for radon-resistant construction, to administer
the Radon Contractor Proficiency (RCP) program, and to devise and
implement public information campaigns aimed at persuading the
public to test for and mitigate indoor radon. EPA already has
produced the first draft of a national radon potential map that
divides the U.S. into three radon zones, similar to the requirements
of S. 792.

Acting on the advice of E-R-C and other real estate groups, EPA has
committed to producing the "Home Buyer's and Seller's Guide to
Radon" as a supplement to the "CitizenTs Guide," aimed strictly at
the real estate transaction. Besides being a more concise document
than the "Citizen's Guide," the "Real Estate Guide" will recommend
short-term testing protocol that is not as time consuming and,
hopefully, not as expensive as the two-test recommendation in the
"Citizen's Guide."

After months of consulting with outside groups and scientists, EPA
narrowed the possible testing methodologies to eight, and asked for
an opinion from its Science Advisory Board as to the efficacy of
each. Although the board has yet to return its recommendations, it
appears likely that the "Real Estate Guide" will recommend either
one short-term test in the lowest liveable area of the house, or two
short-term simultaneous tests in the lowest living area.

WHAT THIS MEANS TO RELOCATION

The relocation industry took an early, pro-active stance concerning
indoor radon. Because of the policies that were enacted years ago, it
has been argued that a potential spate of claims and lawsuits has
been avoided.

When EPA began to reconsider its recommended testing procedures,
the scope of the testing and remediation required to limit liability
became unclear. When released in the "Citizen's Guide" and the "Real
Estate Guide", these recommendations essentially will form the
minimum standard for any relocation policy.

Absent any federal or state law to the contrary, relocation
administrators will be free to reevaluate their radon policies,
bringing them into compliance with the recommendations of EPA
publications, making judgements about, for example, whether it is
necessary, from a liability point of view, to remediate homes with
levels moderately above 4 pCi/l, or whether simple disclosure will
adequately protect against liability.

All of these decisions will be made in an environment in which, if
EPA is sucessful, all home buyers will be better informed about
indoor radon potentials.

HR 3258 REVIEWERS MAKE COMMENTS, SHARE CONCERNS

As radon-related bills develop and mature on Capitol Hill, both
private and public sector lobbyists spend considerable effort
organizing letter writing campaigns, telephone trees and
encouraging industry members to make known their concerns. During
the formulation and development of House Bill 3258, and its
companion, Senate Bill 792, the radon industry showed it is no
exception to the rule.

On March 10 of this year, the Senate passed S. 792, a reauthorization
of the Indoor Radon Abatement Act of 1988, known as the Indoor
Radon Abatement Reauthorization Act of 1991. This very
comprehensive bill is likely to be modified in conference, should the
House pass its radon bill, H.R. 3258, the "Radon Awareness and
Disclosure Act."

The comment period for H.R. 3258 drew a variety of responses,
including comments providing insight into organizations and their
concern for the radon issue. Of particular interest to our readers are
comments submitted by Richard Martin (AARST), Dr. Jill Lipoti (New
Jersey, Department of Environmental Protection), Bob Chase
(National Education Association and the National Parents and
Teachers Association), and representatives for the National
Association of Home Builders (NAHB) and the Consumer Association
of America.

NAHB

NAHB comments indicate the organization supports "prescriptive
construction techniques only in areas where radon is a problem."
NAHB says its members might need an "incentive" to cooperate
volunarily, such as a limitation on liability for builders who build to
EPA construction standards or state equivalents.

As has been the case in the past, NAHB says it "does not believe
tying radon testing to the home sales transaction is the answer."
The primary objection, short-term test reliance. As a justification
for their objection to testing new homes as a condition of sale,
NAHB says its members believe testing should only be done while the
homeowner is actually living in the home. In addition, they say, "new
homes take up to a year to settle" so testing a brand new house that
has not fully settled "is likely" to produce a false reading.

The association says its members already are complaining that
banks are refusing to make loans for homes where testing is
required as a condition of sale -- "out of fear for future legal
liability."

CONSUMER FEDERATION

The Consumer Federation for America, in conjunction with the
American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association, the
American Public Health Association and the U.S. Public Interest
Research Group, made their feelings about H.R. 3258 known to
legislators as well.

Representatives from these organizations say they believe the
public can no longer rely on realtors, builders, salespersons or the
radon industry to inform them about radon. The reason: ignorance.
These organizations say they believe the American public is in need
of an education when it comes to radon, especially if they are to
make decisions about testing and mitigation voluntarily.

According to a national survey conducted by the Federation, few
Americans are prepared to make such decisions by themselves. When
survey respondants were asked "Why is radon a problem?", 17
percent replied because it can cause high blood pressure, 15 percent
believed the gas caused unpleasant odors, and an additional six
percent said they believed it discolored walls and furniture.

As far as testing is concerned, nearly half of all respondants knew
next to nothing about radon testing.

According to the Federation survey, 45 percent of Americans
surveyed answered the question "How do you detect radon?"
incorrectly. Twenty-two percent of the respondants said radon could
be detected by smell, 12 percent by stains on walls and 11 percent
by using a Geiger counter.

The Federation says its supports H.R. 3258 because "it addresses
two fundamental issues for consumers: saving lives and protecting
consumers in radon-related transactions. Protection? From what?
According to the Federation, consumers need protections from
potentially unscrupulous radon contractors and test device
manufacturers who fail to participate and pass proficiency exams.
Civil penalties should be put in place, the Federation says, "to act as
a deterrent."

PARENTS AND TEACHERS

The NEA and PTA, both organizations specifically concerned about
radon in schools, say a two-tiered approach is needed to address the
issue in America's schools. First, they say, schools in high radon
priority areas should be tested as soon as possible. Schools not
located in high radon priority areas should be allowed four years
from the date of enactment to test.

In determining compliance, NEA says it believes the legislation
should specify waivers to school districts which have already tested
and/or mitigated -- providing all EPA protocol, including parent and
teacher notification of testing and mitigation results, were
followed.

NEA also says it supports an "ongoing annual notification rule"
requiring schools to keep parents notified of the mitigation process
progress until completed.

NEW JERSEY DEP

The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection says it
supports the continuation of grant assistance to state programs
found in H.R. 3258, however, the agency says, "more" state
assistance is needed. The agency says it believes the feds must kick
in additional support, including 75 percent program costs, in order
for most states to continue existing and planned radon programs.

They cite a recent Conference of Radiation Control Program
Directors survey which indicates state radon programs are in danger
of being cut back. The survey found that if State Indoor Radon Grants
are not extended beyond fiscal year 1991, 84 percent of the
responding state radon program leaders said they "would be forced
to reduce their radon program, drastically."

Thirty-four percent said they would eliminate staff, while six
percent would have to abandon their programs entirely.

NJDEP, no doubt echoing the opinions of other states with existing
radon programs and legislation, suggests exempting persons
participating in state programs from mandatory participation in a
federal program, in order to "avoid placing undue burden on regulated
individuals in states which already have a state certification
program, the requirements of which, in most cases, far exceed those
listed in H.R. 3258."

AARST

Representing the radon industry, Rich Martin, president of DMA-
RADTECH, said H.R. 3258 would help reduce cancer risk by
providing increased industry professionalism by mandating
participation in testing and mitigation programs. Mandatory
participation in RMP/RCP programs, the association says, will help
"elevate the quality" of radon related services to a minimum
competence level acceptable to a federal agency.

Not unlike the Consumer Federation, AARST also supports the civil
penalties contained in the bill.  those contractors who choose not to
follow the laws regarding certification and participation.

The radon industry association says if H.R. 3258 is enacted it will
help reduce cancers risk by: 1) providing financial assistance to
schools which need to test and/or mitigate but cannot afford to do
so, 2) requiring schools that test or mitigate to utilize approved
firms or individuals who have satisfactorily passed certification
programs, and, 3) forming a Presidential Commission on Radon
Awareness designed to assure radon public outreach programs reach
their specific goals.

EPA RADON PROGRAM REVIEW: GOVERNMENT, PRIVATE SECTOR
RESPONSES ARE VARIED

Last fall, radon industry professionals participated in an intra-
agency review of EPA's Radon Program. Comprised of members of
government and the private sector, the agency's Radon Program
Review Panel was charged with assessing the program's past
efforts, current progress and future direction. Their efforts
produced a draft report, sent to reviewers earlier this year, which
assessed the costs and effectiveness of a range of radon control
strategies and contained the Panel's findings and recommendations
for improving the radon program.

EPA REVIEWERS

EPA says it is looking for "opportunities for pursuing new
directions" in an effort to increase radon reduction in the U.S. The
agency says the review was conducted with three objectives in
mind:

1) to examine the appropriateness of program goals and EPA's
progress in achieving them;

2) to evaluate the effectiveness of the current approach; and

3) to identify alternative approaches and determine what they might
enable EPA to accomplish.

EPA representatives on the panel included senior managers who were
responsible for recommending actions which would improve the
radon program and determine the appropriate role government should
play in reducing public risk. Four major recommendations were
issued.

1) EPA should focus on the greatest risks first. In the near-term,
EPA should target its efforts and resources on high radon potenital
areas and smoking-related risk. EPA survey data indicate about half
of the homes over the action level are located in areas comprising
(as a group) about one-fifth of the country. This same area is
estimated to contain a significant portion of the lives projected to
be saved if all U.S. homes above the current 4 pCi/l action level were
tested and mitigated. Current epidemiological data indicate both
smokers and former smokers face over 90 percent of radon risk.
While EPA should not abandon its efforts in other areas, these
factors must shape EPA's policy.

2) EPA should work now to support the long-term strategies of
promoting radon-resistant new construction and testing and
mitigation in connection with real estate transfers. Beginning in
targeted areas, EPA should encourage and support pilot projects at
the State and local level and explore new approaches to implement
these strategies. EPA experience to date indicate the vast majority
of radon risk reduction occurs in the context of real estate
transactions and adoption of new construction standards has the
potential for very cost-effective risk reduction -- in some cases
saving both lives and dollars. While the risk reductions offered by
these strategies are modest at first, over the long-term, they offer
the possibility of very large risk reductions. Only through these
strategies can EPA aspire to its ultimate statutory goal of
approaching ambient levels in all U.S. homes.

3) A new strategy for public information. As a health risk controlled
primarily by individual citizens, EPA has properly set for itself a
central and independent goal of informing the public about radon
risk. The public's generally weak response suggests EPA must move
beyond a program of nationwide public information efforts such as
the "Citizen's Guide" and the Advertising Council's public service
announcement campaign. In the short-term, EPA's public information
efforts should focus on high radon potential areas and populations. In
the long-term, efforts should be directed toward construction of
radon-resistant new homes and testing and mitigation of existing
homes when they are sold.

4) EPA should develop a coordinated research plan. EPA has
successfully supported a wide range of radon testing, mitigation,
and characterization research. With basic technologies established,
EPA must develop a long-term plan to prioritize and coordinate
potential future research in areas such as health effects,
measurement, mitigation technology, geographic targeting, and risk
communication approaches.

THE PRIVATE SECTOR

Private sector reviewers developed recommendations addressing
several dozen issues which affect the radon industry. Of
significance are three of the panel's findings relating to radon and
public information, resistant building techniques and radon testing
at point of sale.

1) Reducing Risk by Radon Resistant Construction. The panel
determined "if all new homes built in designated areas" were built
with radon-resistant features, an estimated 30-50 lung cancers
deaths would be averted each year. The panel noted the rate of lives
saved would increase each year.

"Radon resistant new homes," the panel says, "are also specially
sealed and weatherized, which, in addition to retarding radon entry,
can make the home substantially more energy efficient. This
increaseed efficiency is estimated to yield a substantial energy
credit."

2) Reducing radon risk at real estate transactions. Because most
radon testing and mitigation currently occurs during real estate
transactions, the panel says "testing and mitigation of all homes
sold would yield steadily increasing risk reduction each year."

According to the panel, nationwide testing and mitigation of all
home sold (when necessary) would avert an estimated 110 lung
cancer deaths at a cost of $700,000 per life saved. The panel noted
requiring distribution of radon information when homes are
purchased with federal-guaranteed mortgages would offer only
moderate risk reduction -- averting an estimated 10-15 lung cancer
deaths each year.

Editor's Note: It would take approximately 10 years of information
distribution in federal-related mortgages to produce lung cancer
death reductions equal to or greater than one year of requiring radon
testing and mitigation during all real property transfers.

3) Public Information. The reviewers determined that state and local
public information and incentive programs have yielded "limited
responses." EPA's experience to date suggests, the panel says,
"public information alone is not enough to contribute significantly
to future risk reduction."

Public information may make its most significant risk reduction
contribution by providing support for long-term institutional
changes encouraging both actions to reduce radon risk when homes
are sold and the adoption of radon resistant new construction codes.

Other key issues examined by the panel include:

What role should government play in dealing with radon in homes?

The panel says it believes government bears a special responsibility
to inform the public about radon. Success in fulfilling this role
should be measured by the quality of information provided and the
extent of improvement in public understanding -- not necesarily the
amount of testing and mitigation it triggers.

When public protection cannot be achieved with stronger action,
government should move beyond providing information. The panel
determined government's role should be shaped by level of risk. And,
it's role in informing the public should be stronger in areas with
higher levels of risk. Both federal and state, as well as local
governments, health and consumer organizations, should play a
critical role.

What should be the ultimate goals of the radon program?

The reviewers make five suggestions, first of which is radon
reduction. Informing the public and building a private sector radon
testing and mitigation industry also is critical, the panel says.
Moving beyond solely providing information to achieve reduction is
next on the list with recommendations to establish "separate but
complementary" short- and long-term goals by which to judge
success. Improving and maintaining credibility, ranked fourth and
fifth.

To what extent should special efforts be made to reach smokers and
former smokers?

Because of substantial risk differentials between smokers, former
smokers and non-smokers, EPA should make a strong effort to target
smokers and former smokers.

The panel recommends EPA urge organizations and agencies
providing anti-smoking programs to warn smokers radon is a serious
hazard to their health  even if they stop. Exploring specific ways to
target current and former smokers is a must, they say.

How can EPA most effectively increase testing and mitigation at the
time of real estate transfers?

Voluntary testing in connection with real estate transactions is
currently too infrequent to result in significant risk reductions, the
panel says. Such voluntary testing will not increase significantly
until action is taken to remove or reduce some of the obstacles (e.g.
workable testing protocols.

The panel also says the agency should seriously examine radon
escrow accounts and dissemination of radon information at the time
of a real estate property transfer.

Is there a need for additional radon-related research?

EPA's radon-related research efforts have been successful, the panel
says, however, they are in need of greater coordination. EPA needs a
comprehensive, prioritized and coordinated plan to guide its future
research activities. Further research topics include health effects
and risk to smokers, former smokers and never smokers,
measurement device accuracy, correlations between short- and
long-term measurements, new testing devices, tamper resistant
measurement techniques, ambient radon levels in high radon
potential areas, mitigation technology, geographic targeting
research and risk communication.

Editor's Note: It will interesting to see how these recommendations
affect future EPA activities.

THE CHANGING FACE OF RISK ASSESMENT

As a young industry with many critics, professional risk
assessors say they are re-examining the way in which they
determine environmental risks. The industry is searching for the
best methods of determining risk by making swift strides away from
defining risk by "maximum worst case exposure" standards and
moving toward a "reasonable maximum exposure" unit of measure.

According to industry news articles, changing the way assessors
measure risk will make a big difference in how a site is evaluated
and treated. Risk assessors say they are ready to move toward
evaluating environmental hazards by using the "weight of evidence"
approach, which if adopted by the industry, would put radon higher
up on the EPA priority list.

Under the "weight of evidence approach," assessors would compile
all relevant data, including animal and human toxicology studies,
extrapolated estimates of risk and all additional information
available on a potential hazard, to help make a determination of risk.
Estimates of risk would then be made by examining all data
available and formulating a "reasonable maximum exposure."

The risk assessment industry is not alone in seeking change. Two
Nuclear Regulatory Committees are examining risk assessment
methods; the interagency Federa; Coordinating Council on Science,
Engineering and Technology is attempting to standardize the U.S.
government's health and environmental risk assessment methods.

Vice President Danforth Quayle's Council on Competitiveness is
evaluating biotechnology risk assessment policy. The U.S. Congress
and the White House have agreed to set up the Risk Assessment and
Management Commission. And, EPA Chief William Reilly is
prioritizing environmental hazards so EPA can perform bureaucratic
triage.

Should the EPA and risk assessors adopt the "weight of evidence"
approach, and bureuacrats begin funding environmental cleanup
program based on risk to the public, funding for the radon issue
should get a significant boost.

RADON NEWS DIGEST via NewsNet
September 1992

READER'S VIEWS

Dear Editor:

I would appreciate it very much if you would publish this letter. The
so-called "radon experts" in the Ohio Department of Health have
argued with me that radon companies that utilize continuous
monitors are not primarly laboratories and for that reason their
handlers need not be licensed as primary labs, nor need they pay the
$600 license fee required by the state.

As a result of their false interpretation of our State law
(3701-69-08), there are testers using continuous monitors who have
not paid their State registration fee and are not licensed to operate
primary laboratories according to EPA definitions.

A continuous monitor has been defined by EPA as a primary lab. It is
not fair to those of us who have paid their laboratory license fees to
allow these people to compete with us in the radon testing market
without having paid the $600 license fee. Some of these people are
in further violation of the law since they are not maintaining their
current listing in the EPA RMP Round. This fact again gives these
people a further advantage to offer cheaper radon testing services.

I had to fly to Las Vegas to the EPA Radon facility on order to
maintain my current listing for continuous monitors. Flight, hotel,
cab fare, etc., cost me $650, which I now have to pass on to the
consumer.

Therefore, I am asking that the DOH immediately enforce the law by
ordering non-licensed and non-EPA listed primary labs to cease
radon testing using continuous monitors.

The success of the newly-enacted State Radon Licensure Program
depends on its fair and equitable enforcement for all.

Helmar H. A. Dollwet, PhD
Akron, OH

Editor's note: We contacted the Ohio radon program and were told
that the state "as of now" does not require continuous monitor
operators to meet the requirements of a primary radon laboratory.
State officials told RND that continuous monitors are considered "a
tool" and for that reason operators of those devices need not meet
primary lab requirements.

We also contacted EPA and they seem to be in agreement with Mr.
Dollwet, although at presstime, we were unable to get through to
those "in the know" at the agency. We will follow-up on this issue
and report our findings in a future issue.

Mr. Dollwet, meanwhile, has found his own solution. He says, if the
State of Ohio won't make the situation right he will refuse to pay
future State licensing fees.

Dear Editor:

I just received the enclosed bulletin from Mr. Cris Collie of the
Employee Relocation Council. (The bulletin alerts those concerned
with real estate property transfers that H.R. 11, a House bill
containing a proposal to place a cap of $5,000 on allowable moving
expense deductions, needs an immediate response from radon
industry members.)

With the consumer deficient awareness of the radon hazard and the
apathetic attitude of many in the federal and state governments,
radon testing where it is not mandatory will be an expense that will
not be considered. It is addressed at the lattermost orientation of
the employee's move and close to the cumulative dollar total.

To be perfectly frank, my past experience as an executive with a
large Fortune 200 company leads me to believe that expenses which
have tangible value will be considered as foremost. The family will
forego the expense of radon testing and other "nuisance" expenses.
They do this so as to escape the burden of taxes.

Since we are so directly Involved, we point out the dangers of this
bill, H.R. 11. I believe we as the representatives of an industry, must
point out the detrimental health effects of this bill. Though the
profit motive is important, the paramount motive is to save lives.

Nick Nickitas
Tampa, FL

Editor's Note: We contacted Mr. Collie, who told RND that the House
has already passed the bill, although, the Senate is considering
another, more favorable version. Contact Mr. Collie at 202-857-0857
for information on how you can help make sure radon-related issues
are not left out.

Dear Editor:

The United States Code of Federal Regulations includes an entire
section (10 CFR 20) devoted to both occupational and non-
occupational exposure to many forms of radiation. However, there is
not one mention of indoor radon exposure despite the fact that
radon-related research has produced the most complete body of
evidence that radon exposure causes lung cancer.

For miners, radiation is an occupational hazard. In an attempt to
minimize exposure, miners are restricted to a total yearly dose of 4
WLM and must wear respirators if the concentration of radon in the
mine reaches 16 pCi/l.

Although it is quite common for indoor radon levels to reach 16
pCi/l in many U.S. homes, government regulations offer more
protection from radiation exposure in mines than they do in our
homes.

Why is it that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission believes
occupational radiation exposure should be limited to 500 MREM per
year in nuclear facilities while residents of homes with a 4 pCi/l
radon level are allowed to receive over 650 MREM of exposure (12
hours per day in the home, 340 days per year)?

If regulations governing radiation exposure at nuclear power
facilities were applied to residential radon exposure the NRC policy
would make better sense. We must treat radon as the health hazard
that it is. And, according to the U.S. EPA, radon is a Group A
carcinogen with solid human data directly linking it to cancer.

Technologists

SLANTS & TRENDS

NEW READINGS OF URANIUM CONTAMINATION in wells drilled at the Feed
Materials Production Center may be alarming the public needlessly. Regular
monitoring of ground water contamination in an admittedly contaminated area
last spring showed a sudden spike in uranium concentrations,
and comments by officials from the U.S.  Department of Energy and Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency were misinterpreted.

ALTHOUGH THE LEVELS WERE 10-30 TIMES as high as proposed standards by the
federal EPA, results in the lower end of that range were fully expected.
When word of higher readings came out early this month, newspapers and
newswire services quickly said the officials suspected new contamination
and even contended the water supply of Cincinnati, 18 miles away, and
Dayton, 40 miles away, might be endangered.

NO SUCH THREAT EXISTS, the officials tell DPW, and they never hinted at
one. Graham Mitchell of Ohio EPA explained his comment about the
contamination possibly being more recent meant it might have happened 10
years ago instead of 20 years ago. And while contaminated wells are tapping
a part of the same aquifer used for drinking water for Dayton, the polluted
plume extends only about 1.5 miles from the plant and is heading away from
that city. Even though it is headed generally toward Cincinnati, both DOE
and Ohio EPA officials are confident it can be stopped long short of there.
"I don't think it will ever have the chance to get to Cincinnati," said
Mitchell.

IF FERNALD AND ROCKY FLATS LOOK BAD, the explosion at a high-level nuclear
waste dump at Kyshtym in the USSR was much worse than anyone has admitted,
the Soviets now say.  That accident in the late 1950s released not the 2
million curies admitted by Soviet officials only a year ago, but 20 million
curies. This compares to the 50 million curies released by the Chernobyl
civilian nuclear accident.

DOE TO DEVELOP DEEP BOREHOLE SAMPLING
TECHNIQUES IN MICROBIOLOGY PROGRAM

    Department of Energy will develop and evaluate sampling techniques in
fiscal 1990 and 1991 under its Deep Microbiology Program. This will be
followed by an accelerated five-year (FY'92-96) Phase II research program
including field experimentation to test new concepts with contaminated
zones at one or more DOE sites.

    The 15- to 20-year goal of the program is to contribute new scientific
information that will make bioremediation of contaminated DOE sites easier,
the agency says in an implementation plan. Experience gained at the DOE
sites will be transferred to other agencies and to private industry. The
most important scientific goal of the transitional program is to obtain
comparative information on subsurface microbial communities among DOE
sites.

    At present, DOE says, "no cost-effective technologies exist for cleanup
of ground water contamination at depths of 400-600 ft. or greater." By
studying the presence, diversity and adaptability of deep microorganisms at
various sites, DOE hopes to contribute to, and speed the cleanup of, deep
aquifers. "Recently discovered deep microorganisms obtained [last year]
during Phase 1 appear to be physiologically capable of degrading
recalcitrant organic chemicals (and possibly organic-radionuclide
complexes), and their activity may be enhanced in-situ to eliminate or
transform contaminants," says the implementation plan.

    DOE's Richland and Idaho Operations Offices, Pacific Northwest
Laboratory's Environmental Sciences Research Center and the Idaho National
Laboratory, run by EG&G Inc., will provide financial and scientific
support. DOE's Office of Energy Research Subsurface Science Program is
funding competitive research and essential logistical tasks to ensure
aseptic samples are obtained.

    DOE will implement the transitional program at INEL and the Hanford
site. Results at the first site will meet two or more scientific
objectives in the program plan and provide scientific and technological
experience needed to confirm results or meet objectives at the next site.
Site sampling and analysis will be completed sequentially through
activities at INEL, Hanford and the Nevada Test Site. Operational and
scientific payoffs of FY'90 activities are as follows:

    o Savage Island Exploratory Borehole (Hanford). Operational:
Development of microbial tracers; initial experience in hard-rock sampling
protocols; refinement of rotary-mud drilling methods for partially
consolidated sediments. Scientific:  First indication of microbes in deep
zones with different hydrochemistry from SRS; improved detection of
microbial contamination with labelled natural bacteria.

    o Snake River Deep Interbed Probe (INEL). Operational: Enhanced use of
hard-rock and unconsolidated sampling for use at Hanford; specific
evaluation of use of new air/argon drilling technique for microbial sample
acquisition. Scientific:  Substantiation of lack of organisms in
low-permeability formations; determination of organism distribution
patterns in fracture flow terrain at DOE sites; determination of organism
physiology and distribution in high-flow ground water.

    o Aseptic Sampling Technology Development (Hanford). Operational:
Development and evaluation of new aseptic sampling methods for collection
of high-quality microbiological samples in varied and complex
hydrogeologic systems at DOE sites.

    o Western States Mixed Softrock/Hardrock Sequence (Hanford/Yakima
Barricade).  Operational: Use of verified aspectic techniques for mixed
soft- and hard-rock sequence; demonstation of particle/colloid and
microbial tracer efficiency under complex hydrologic conditions
representative of DOE sites. Scientific: Widening range of lithologies,
geochemistry and permeabilities to maximize comparative opportunities with
SRS; varied ground water age and recharge sources to make unique genetic,
physiological and metabolic comparisons to organisms at SRS and INEL.

    o Subsurface Hardrock Spatial Variability Experiment (NTS).
Operational: Refine statistical sampling strategy to assess
multi-dimensional distribution of organisms; improve techniques for
isolation of microbes from hard-rock samples.  Scientific: Document rock
fracture control on organism distribution; identify minimum sample size to
define macroscopic population characteristics; unique data-set on microbial
distributions for application of geostatistical techniques.

    o Contaminated Site/Bioremediation Research Site (FY'91). Operational:
Use of specialized aseptic sampling techniques in chemically contaminated
environments; co-quantification of chemical and microbiological
distribution with depth; use of proven tracer technology to document sample
integrity. Scientific: Effects of organic/inorganic contaminants on
microbial populations, activity and diversity; indentification/isolation of
contaminant-adapted or contaminant-using organisms; microbial distributions
in a representative site requiring bioremediaton.

RISK OF CANCER FROM LOW-LEVEL EXPOSURE
TO RADIATION COULD BE HIGHER THAN THOUGHT

    The risk of developing cancer from exposure to low levels of X-rays and
gamma rays could be as high as 3-4 times greater than those previously
estimated, but epidemiological studies of nuclear weapons workers appear to
show only that the risks are as high as expected, says a National Research
Council committee.

    The committee updated findings of the BEIR III panel, which issued its
report on health effects from alpha particle emitters. Higher risk
estimates presented in the new report, BEIR V, stem from new risk models,
revised dose estimates for survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic
bombs, and additional epidemiological data on cancers and other health
effects experienced by both A-bomb survivors and persons exposed to
radiation for medical purposes.

    The new report notes several studies reviewed on nuclear worker
epidemiology "have yet to accumulate a sufficient number of deaths to reach
any sensible conclusions relating to individual types of cancer. The most
consistent result ...  is that the risk estimates for all types of cancer
combined and for all types of leukemia combined are consistent with the
risk estimates" in BEIR V.

    The worker studies include reviews of British Nuclear Fuels Ltd.
(Windscale Plant and Sellafield Plant) in the United Kingdom; Hanford Site,
Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge Y-12 Plant, and Rocky Flats
Nuclear Weapons Plant, in the U.S.; and Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. in
Canada, along with studies of workers at civilian nuclear plants.

    Energy Secretary James D. Watkins on Dec. 20 directed Peter Brush,
acting assistant secretary for environment, safety and health, to review
the BEIR V report and its potential implications for DOE's nuclear
operations, including making recommendations for modifying operations,
where needed. Watkins called for an interim report within 90 days and a
final report by June 30, 1990.

GAO OFFERS DOD ADVICE ON MINIMIZING AMOUNT
OF UNUSED HAZARDOUS WASTE SENT FOR DISPOSAL

    The Department of Defense fails to minimize unused hazardous materials
transferred for disposal, the General Accounting Office says in a newly
released report. The accounting arm of Congress based its analysis on a
random sample from 10 installations, finding that 40% of the waste was
unused hazardous materials.

    Hazardous materials with a $250 million acquisition value were
transferred for disposal during fiscal 1986-88, says the report, prepared
at the request of Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Calif.), chairman of the House
Government Operations Subcommittee on the Environment. Materials initially
worth more than $195 million were disposed of in FY'86-88 by sales to the
public (43%), disposal service contracts (31%), reuse within DOD (13%),
transfer/donation to non-DOD users (12%) and miscellaneous disposals (less
than 1%). The remainder will stay in storage until a decision is reached on
the manner in which the materials will be disposed of.

    The inventory control procedure of first-in, first-out (FIFO), which
can minimize the chance of hazardous materials becoming hazardous waste
due to shelf-life expiration, is not always followed because of a lack of
internal controls, GAO found. Some exceptions to the procedure are
permitted that do not fully take into account extra costs incurred in the
disposal of hazmat.

    DOD does not always follow its regulations that the condition of
hazardous materials be evaluated periodically, GAO points out. The rules
also say shelf life is extended after inspection and testing at the depot
or installation, when possible. Officials contacted by GAO blame the lack
of evaluations on funding constraints, inadequate emphasis by management or
a lack of guidance to users on how to evaluate hazmat conditions. Such
materials sometimes are transferred for disposal without testing or
evaluation to see if shelf-lives could be extended, GAO maintains, and some
Army installations keep hazmats in their inventories for an extended period
of time without evaluating their condition.

    DOD uses the same management procedures for hazardous and nonhazardous
materials, GAO notes. If it had special procedures for managing hazmat
inventories, the report concludes, the cost of unnecessary disposal and
potential liability for environmental damage and future cleanup costs could
be decreased.

    Some improvements are on the way, GAO adds. The Navy established
instructions June 20, 1989, to improve life-cycle management of its
hazmats. The rules address management of hazmat inventories, including
controls over their procurement, management procedures for excess hazmats
and waste, quality assurance evaluations, documentation, and record-keeping
and reporting. These elements bring a structure to the management of wastes
in the Navy, GAO contends, pointing out that the Air Force and Army have no
comparable effort under way.

    GAO wants each service to provide special attention to inventory
management procedures for hazmats. These should include directing the
Defense Logistics Agency and the General Services Administration, through
the memorandum of agreement between DOD and the GSA, to make greater use
of direct delivery contracts for hazmats with a short shelf-life; supply
organizations to make greater use of FIFO procedures for short shelf-life
hazmats and to discourage exceptions; and supply depots and installations
to evaluate the condition of hazmats consistently through periodic testing
or inspections before sending them out for disposal.

    Free copies of "Hazardous Waste -- Attention to DOD Inventories of
Hazardous Materials Needed," GAO/NSIAD-90-11, are available from GAO, Box
6015, Gaithersburg, Md. 20877, (301) 275-6241.

EPA REGION 5 PROPOSES INCREASE IN PENALTY
AGAINST WESTINGHOUSE FOR FMPC VIOLATIONS

    Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio would receive a much stiffer fine
than initially proposed for violations at the Feed Materials Production
Center at Fernald, under a motion filed by the Environmental Protection
Agency Region 5. The amended complaint, filed Dec. 19, asks for $330,500
and is based on violations discovered at the facility after an initial
filing of a Feb. 9, 1989, complaint with a proposed fine of $196,500.

    During two inspections last August and October, EPA found more than 25
new and recurring violations of federal hazardous waste regulations.
Specifically, EPA alleges that Westinghouse has failed to complete required
waste analyses and waste determination plans; failed to designate itself as
operator on the hazardous waste permit application; continued to monitor
ground water inadequately; and submitted inadequate closure plans,
operating records, job descriptions and training records.

    EPA filed this latest motion with Administrative Law Judge Thomas Hoya.
If Hoya grants the motion to amend the original complaint and boost the
penalty, Westinghouse will have the right to request a hearing to contest
any new allegations made by the federal government.

    In a related note, the Department of Energy says it is dropping its
appeal of a $78 million judgment by the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Ohio resolving a $300 million suit filed in 1985 by
the facility's neighbors, who maintain that radioactive emissions over
three decades from the plutonium-processing plant have endangered their
health, caused emotional distress and lowered the property value of their
houses (DPW, July 7, 1989).

    "We're not going to pursue our appeal," explained DOE attorney Steven
Wakefield, but "the bad news is that the department discovered earlier [in
the week of Dec. 17] that it cannot pay the judgment from a fund it had
planned to use." DOE had wanted to use a federal contingency fund, but was
barred from doing so because the suit was initially filed against a
contractor, not the government.  DOE now must seek a separate appropriation
from Congress to establish the fund.

    The plaintiffs accepted the decision -- with the money earmarked for
lifetime epidemiological studies and health monitoring -- but the final
agreement and acceptance by Judge S. Arthur Spiegel was held up as DOE
disagreed with plaintiffs over the decision's interpretation (DPW, Sept. 1,
1989). Two private companies in the area had complained that some
of the industrial waste pollution for which they had been cited separately
was due to FMPC's operations. One corporate complainant said his firm's
property value also was diminished, but the court said he would have to
file separately for compensation.

    DOE had appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Sixth Circuit, arguing the accord barred any future claims, but plaintiffs
contended that it covered only emotional distress and reduction of property
values. They demanded they could still file to obtain funds to cover
cleanup work; DOE had said some of the $78 million could be earmarked for
cleanup.

    The suit had involved FMPC's operations by NLO, a subsidiary of
National Lead of Ohio, the former contractor, which went out of business.
Because of NLO's departure, DOE had to step in as defendant. The change in
the operations and maintenance contract came after the initial filing and
before the settlement. The contract was transferred to Westinghouse at end
of 1985. Activities at the plant were suspended last year to speed up
decontamination.

BATTELLE SENSOR FOR DETECTING CONTAMINANTS
IN SOIL TO BE MORE ACCURATE, LESS EXPENSIVE

    Battelle Memorial Institute's device for improving detection of fuel
oil, stored gasoline, solvents and other organic liquids dumped or leaking
into soil (DPW, Dec. 22, 1989) is expected to be more accurate,
less expensive and simpler to use than current competing technologies.
Developed by researchers at Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest
Laboratory, operated by Battelle, the device will be made available for
commercialization and manufacture.

    Battelle's new sensor, constructed from materials costing less than
those employed in current devices, could be used by environmental
researchers to measure the amount and location of organic liquids that
have seeped into the soil.  "It could be used to detect leaks in new
storage tanks as well as to monitor the severity of leaks from older
storage facilities," suggests John W. Cary of Battelle's Earth and
Environmental Sciences Center.

    Cary created the sensor to assist Battelle researchers in their studies
of how organic fluids move in the subsurface environment and how to reduce
or repair their ecological effects. "Traditionally, devices such as 'gypsum
blocks' are used to measure water content within soil," he explained.
"These measuring instruments are more expensive and do not detect organic
liquids. On the other hand, most sensors that are used to detect organic
liquids in soils detect vapors rather than the presence of liquid. These,
too, are expensive."

    The sensor features an optical switch containing a solid-state
infrared-light-emitting device joined to a porous disk made of ceramic,
fritted glass, PTFE (Teflon) or various carbon-based materials. Which
material is selected determines whether water or organic liquid is absorbed
into the pores.

    The disk is placed into the soil where liquid, if present, is absorbed.
Light transmitted through the disk is measured and is proportionate to the
amount of water or organic liquid that is absorbed into the pores. The
amount of liquid in the disk can be related to the amount of liquid in the
surrounding soil. The disk remains in the soil the entire time the
measurement is made.

ARMY TESTING COMPOSTING OF SOIL
TO ELIMINATE EXPLOSIVE CONTAMINATION

    The U.S. Army's 19,700-acre Umatill Depot near Hermiston, Ore., will be
the testing site for an experiment in treating soil contaminated by
explosives. The composting experiment will use microorganisms to consume
the contaminants in soils and sediments, explains Capt. Craig Myler,
project officer for the Army's Toxic and Hazardous Materials Agency
(USATHAMA).

    Because microbes do not naturally feed quickly enough on TNT particles,
they will be coaxed in tests in special greenhouses, where soil is enriched
with addi tional microbe food sources, such as hay, straw, manure or
livestock feed. Much of the contamination comes from dry ponds used 25
years ago to settle out high-explosive residues, Myler says. The explosive
material seeped through the ponds' sandy bottoms.

    Contamination also had spread across some 1,100 acres used for disposal
of rocket fuels, battery acid, explosives and propellants. Some of these
pollutants, which include nitrates, nitrites, cyanide and metals, have
migrated to ground water. The composting system is less expensive than
incineration, the only alternative. Burning the residue costs about $300
per ton, or as much as three times that for composting.

    The Department of Energy's Idaho and Richland Operations offices will
seek better technologies to solve waste management and environmental
restoration problems in Idaho and Washington under a new agreement. The
accord will address Secretary James D. Watkins' Environmental Restoration
and Waste Management Five-Year Plan initiatives announced earlier this year
(DPW, Sept. 1, 1989).

    The new agreement will run through Sept. 30, 1994, providing for
collaboration on waste management and environmental restoration issues
among the Boise and Richland offices, their contractors, and universities
in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana. Funding for the activities will
be provided by DOE as part of Idaho and Richland Operations offices'
approved spending plans.

    The agreement encompasses, but is not limited to: (1) establishing a
DOE team to address parallel research needs and activities; (2) focusing of
combined expertise on objectives of regional interest and national
importance; (3) drawing on existing working relationships effectively to
use technical expertise and experience to assure appropriate resource
application in specific areas of waste management and environmental
restoration; and (4) developing a consortium of the laboratories and other
DOE contractors with northwestern and mountain states universities for
promoting waste management and environmental restoration education through
educational training support and research and development opportunities.

    The accord involves nine areas of collaboration: stabilizing or
destroying waste on site; quantifying potential health and environmental
risks and exposure reductions; processing wastes to recover potentially
useful materials; treating solid and liquid wastes using high temperatures;
developing robotic waste retrieval technologies; differentiating specific
waste sites; demonstrating technologies; developing waste minimization
techniques; and collaborating with universities on research and training.
Additional areas might be added.

    The first tier in a three-tiered management will be a committee of
operations office managers, laboratory directors and operating contractor
presidents/general managers. The second tier will be a six-member steering
committee from each operations office and up to two representatives from
their laboratory or operating contractor. It will be co-chaired by the
operations office representatives. The third tier will consist of activity
project managers, with an Idaho National Engineering Laboratory and a
Hanford project manager for each activity.

    "The collaborative agreement provides a means for better use of time,
talent and funds in solving waste management and environmental restoration
issues important to the Pacific Northwest and the nation," said Watkins.
"An important part of this agreement involves collaboration not just
between different groups in one federal agency, but with regional
universities as well.

    "We expect the universities to play an important role in research on
waste cleanup issues and in developing education and training programs in
waste management and environmental-related areas," Watkins added. "We
believe the education and training programs fostered by this agreement will
produce the additional skilled people needed to clean up both industrial
and DOE wastes." Since he first arrived on the job, Watkins has complained
that he could not find enough trained and experienced people to mount the
effort he would like.

    The agreement was signed by the two operations offices, Battelle
Pacific Northwest Laboratory, Westinghouse Hanford Co., Westinghouse Idaho
Nuclear Co., EG&G Idaho Inc., Mountain State Energy Co. and UNC Geotech.

DROUGHT MAY BE TO BLAME FOR HIGH URANIUM
LEVEL OF CONTAMINATION IN GROUND WATER AT FMPC

    Surprisingly high uranium contamination levels found in wells drilled
70 ft.  into the Great Miami River Aquifer from a point in the southwest
corner of the Feed Materials Production Center at Fernald, Ohio, could have
been the result of last summer's drought, says Andrew Avel, deputy
environmental manager of the Department of Energy's Site Office.

    The contamination had been known for years, but the concentration
levels unexpectedly rose from 309 + 51 parts per billion (ppb) in
samplings taken in late February 1989 and reported the following month, to
851 + 136 ppb in tests made on May 11 and results received June 19, and
fell back down to to 232 + 39 ppb in samples taken July 28 and results
reached on Sept. 7, DPW was told by Avel.

    One theory is that the contamination results from a temporary, partial
drying of the aquifer during a drought last summer. All the readings are
many times higher than U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's unreleased
proposed standard of 30 ppb; there are no standards in place today. The
reduced rainfall could have caused the ground water flow to reverse its
normal southerly course and place the test wells downstream, instead of
upstream, of contamination sources in the nuclear weapons facility, DPW
was told. Renewed rainfall could have returned the gradient to its normal
course, according to this line of thinking at DOE.

    The readings were taken by Advanced Sciences Inc., contractor to the
Department of Energy, not to Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio (WMCO),
operations and management prime contractor at FMPC. They are part of the
remedial investigation/ feasibility study (RIFS) to characterize the
environment surrounding the plant.  Now in the effort's "RI" stage, the
tests on wells within the plant site were made to gather information for a
data base for future environmental restoration.

    The results were first released publicly about two weeks ago by WMCO's
Advisory Committee, an independent group of local citizens, who had been
briefed by WMCO in a regularly scheduled quarterly meeting that touched on
the results of the monitoring of the wells. The readings' results were
buried in the citizen group's press release and picked up Jan. 3 by the
Cincinnati Enquirer.

    The contaminated plume appears to be moving south at a rate of about
200 ft.  per year and now extends some 1.5 miles away from the plant. The
contaminated water wells tap into the Great Miami River Aquifer. No known
polluted water is used for drinking, but some water unsafe for drinking is
treated and used for industrial purposes. Ohio EPA wants to assure
availability of water supplies from the aquifer even though the main water
supply for Cincinnati is the Ohio River.

    The monitoring wells were drilled specifically for the test; they are
not used to draw water for other purposes. Production wells in the area are
checked often, Avel said, and those that have been identified as
contaminated are no longer being used for drinking water. The few outlying
wells in use for drinking water have readings essentially at background
level and are being monitored.

    DOE is working on an agreement with the state and EPA to find a
solution to the contaminated water. One option under consideration is to
pump out the water from the contaminated plume, treat it and return it to
the surface of the ground, DPW has been told, but there is no commitment
yet to take any particular action.  DOE maintains that the 1989 readings
pose no new threat to the public and are not evidence of any new instance
of contamination from FMPC, although that may be the public perception. "We
are concerned, but it's really nothing that surprises us," Avel told DPW.

LAWRENCE LIVERMORE ASKS EPA TO REVIEW
REFUSAL ON HAZARDOUS WASTE PERMIT

    Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) has delivered the plans
for operating its incinerator and hazardous waste storage and treatment
facility to the California Department of Health Services (DHS) and the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency. The 12 volumes are the documentation LLNL
needs to obtain a permit to run the facility.

    They were provided in response to notification of EPA's proposed
intention to deny a hazardous waste permit for nearly all waste operations
at LLNL. The material was delivered in person at a Dec. 18 meeting with
agency officials, but there has been no comment from EPA since, one
official from LLNL's Environmental Protection Department (EPD) told DPW.

    A second EPD official, Susi Jackson, said, "We have worked hard to
comply with regulatory agenda requirements and have documented our
accomplishements and plans for the future in this highly detailed
documentation." She noted that the report "includes a health risk
assessment of our existing incinerator and other documents that reflect our
response to regulatory agency concerns.

    Jackson said LLNL's goal is "to work with EPA and DHS to ensure that
our waste storage and treatment facilities are absolutely in compliance
with existing laws. We have worked closely with the agencies to resolve
all outstanding issues related to the permit applications.

    The lab has "made a strong effort to meet agency requirements and to
assure them of [LLNL's] commitment to operate its facility in an
environmentally sound manner, consistent with regulatory requirements. By
expediting our efforts, we have completed all construction and other tasks
that were scheduled for the next several years under regulatory
requirements.

DOE 'TIGER TEAMS' TO CHECK
LIVERMORE LATE NEXT MONTH

    A Department of Energy "Tiger Team" will inspect the Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory late next month to assess its compliance with
environmental, health and safety regulations. These 25-person investigative
teams are visiting all 18 major facilities in the nuclear weapons complex
plus dozens of other laboratories and installations. They already have
been to Rocky Flats, Fernald, Mound, Pantex, Y-12 and a civilian nuclear
energy facility in New York State.

    Tiger Team members will visit LLNL within a few weeks to make
pre-assessments and develop an agenda for the full-scale investigation,
tentatively set for Feb.  26, explains John Clatworthy, a hazards control
officer. Clatworthy has just returned to LLNL after spending a year at DOE
headquarters as technical and science advisor to the director of the Office
of Weapons Safety and Operations.

SLANTS & TRENDS


SUPERFUND TAKES A HIT - EPA shut down the federal Superfund
program this week because the agency was unable to pay
nearly 2,000 of its employees in that program along with
8,000 contractors who perform remediation work. The
Superfund was not affected immediately by the shutdown of
the federal government because most of those employees are
paid directly from the fund, rather than from budget
appropriations, said Jim Mathews, deputy assistant
administrator for EPA's Office of Solid Waste and Emergency
Response.

     Although Congress has not reauthorized the program or
issued its allotment for the current fiscal year, Superfund
had operated since October from a surplus in last year's
fund, Mathews explained. That money ran out Jan. 2, and the
agency began shutting down the program. Only emergency
personnel will continue working, reducing the agency's
program employees from more than 3,000 to 80. Several
Superfund sites will continue cleanups during the shutdown,
although many will be forced to stop operations, he said.

IN ONE POCKET, OUT THE OTHER - EPA has fined the Department
of Interior's (DOI), National Parks Service for violating
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) by storing
hazardous waste at the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. The
facility stored hazardous waste without a RCRA permit
between March and October of last year, EPA said. The waste
contained acetone, chromium, lead, xylene, phenol, arsenic
and mercury, EPA contended. EPA also cited DOI for storing
waste in rusted, leaking containers. EPA fined the DOI
facility $243,800 and ordered it to develop a hazardous
waste management plan.

EPA BACKS BACT - Proposed new source review (NSR) rules
under development by EPA probably will recommend a "top
down" approach for determining the best available control
technology (BACT) such as technology used to control
emissions from landfills, EPA officials said. The rules also
will give states some flexibility in determining which
control method to use. The proposal, EPA officials said,
will allow states to develop their own BACT determination
criteria as long as they consider the leading technologies
currently available.

MID-SIZED FIRMS DID WELL, NOW POISED
FOR MORE GROWTH, COMPANY REPORTS


     Mid-sized solid waste companies had the most pronounced
growth in the industry during 1995, with revenues increasing
69 percent to $2 billion, and that trend should continue,
according to a report by Raymond James & Associates, a
financial analysis company in St. Petersburg, Fla.

     In general terms, the report said, acquisition growth
accelerated over the past 12 months. The top 13 solid waste
companies are expected to increase their revenues by 21
percent, with a major revenue component driven by
acquisitions, the report also said.

     The report cited USA Waste's recently announced merger
with Western Waste for $530 million (SWR, Dec. 21, 1995, p.
391). If completed, this transaction would raise USA Waste
to third ranking by size in the U.S. solid waste market,
Raymond James noted.

     In addition, the report said, considerably improved
financing costs over the past year made the financing
environment for solid waste companies, particularly smaller
growth companies, better than any time in the past.

Smaller Companies Cited

     On financing issues, the report explained, "We wish to
stress that the improvement in the cost of financing has
been most notable for the smaller waste service companies. A
longer track record leading to enhanced credibility has
enabled these companies to dramatically lower their costs of
capital and benefit not only from lower rates, but from the
access to longer term financing and attractively priced
equity."

     Those financing options were "very limited" as recently
as 15 to 18 months ago, Raymond James explained.

     However, the document also noted that presently, "The
low financing costs clearly provide more attractive dynamics
for public companies to pursue acquisitions."

     In general, the analysis said, long term financing
rates for all companies, as represented by 30 year Treasury
bonds, have dropped considerably, thus providing a backdrop
for continued aggressive acquisition.

     The report, Solid Waste 1995: Mid-Sized Companies Lead
Industry in a Torrid Acquisition Pace, is available from
Raymond James. Contact: William Fisher, (800) 237-5643.

'GREEN WALL' ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
SAID TO HURT CORPORATE MANAGEMENT


     Communication problems between business and
environmental staff members can prevent companies from
successfully managing corporate environmental issues,
according to a survey of major U.S. firms.

     In its primary finding, the survey done by Arthur D.
Little Inc. reported a "green wall" that blocks
communication exists in many companies. For example,
managers for environment, health and safety programs at the
185 corporations Arthur D. Little surveyed often cited their
failure to convince management that environmental programs
are important to their firm's success.

     Numerous company officials responded that environment,
health, and safety functions are often viewed as an outside
operation with a sole mission of "keeping the company out of
trouble," Arthur D. Little also reported. More than 70
percent of those responding cited either a lack of
acceptance of environmental issues, or a separate
environmental "culture" as blocking integrating
environmental functions into their firms' business plans.

STUDY SAYS MRFS ARE ENVIRONMENTALLY
SOUND, CREATE NO HEALTH PROBLEMS


     Although they are not always the most economically
viable systems, state and local governments increasingly use
material recovery facilities (MRFs) for managing municipal
solid waste (MSW), according to a new study (SWR, Dec. 14,
1995, p. 383).

     "I suspect the reason is [the] public press for
recycling," said Philip Shepherd, coauthor of the report,
Environmental, Economic, and Energy Impacts of Material
Recovery Facilities, in making a personal assessment of
interest in MRFs.

     The report, by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), EPA
and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL),
evaluates the economic, energy and environmental aspects of
MRFs by studying six facilities.

     Although the report found nothing revolutionary, said
Shepherd of NREL, it is designed to be a decision-making
tool that helps solid waste managers weigh the outcomes of
different management options. The primary objectives of the
evaluation were to understand the effects of MRFs'
operations on public health and the environment along with
occupational health and safety functions, the document
explained.

     If the study found anything noteworthy, Shepherd said,
it was that MRFs do not use a significant amount of energy
when compared to other components of an integrated solid
waste management system (ISWMS). The fuel use associated
with collecting various recyclables, however, dominates the
overall energy consumption of MRF operations, the government
study also reported.

Environmental Effects

     The document details the six MRFs' effects on ambient
air quality, receiving waters and community noise levels.
The health and safety evaluation section addressed exposure
to chemicals, biological and energy aspects of MRFs based in
South Holbrook, N.Y.; Montgomery County, Md.; Albuquerque,
N.M.; Hartford, Conn.; Rice County, Minn.; and Orange
County, Fla.

     MRFs do not pose significant threats to either public
health or the environment, according to the study. Nuisance
conditions, such as fugitive dust and excessive noise, can
be easily mitigated through roadway maintenance and
enclosing equipment. Potential health and safety hazards for
workers can be controlled by implementing the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) worker protection
programs, the study also concluded.

     The agencies also did a case study of the multi-purpose
recycling facility in South Holbrook owned and operated by
the Islip (N.Y.) Resource Recovery Agency. That facility has
the capacity to handle 240 tons of recyclables during an
eight-hour shift, including newspapers, corrugated
cardboard, mixed paper, metals, tin cans, plastics, flint
glass and aluminum. On alternate Wednesdays, vehicles
deliver either newspapers or mixed recyclables to the MRF.
The recyclables are then hand-sorted from conveyor belts.

     The federal evaluators found no air pollution levels
exceeding the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)
at the Islip MRF. Values for carbon monoxide and mercury
vapor were considerably lower than the applicable OSHA
limits, the report also said. Measurements of volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) resulted in concentrations no
greater than 10 ug/m3, with the exception of three compounds
in the range of 1 to 60 ug/m3 range at a site upwind of the
facility.

Worker Exposure Low

     OSHA's portion of the evaluation there measured
workers' exposure to nuisance dusts, silica, and metals by
collecting breathing zone samples from selected workers
taken periodically over their eight-hour shifts. The highest
total of respirable dust levels were found on the tipping
floor, a total of 3.39 mg/m3 for all dust and 0.55 mg/m3 for
respirable dust. All exposure levels, however, were
considerably lower than the federal permissible exposure
limits (PELs), according to the report.

     Airborne and surface bacteria and fungi samples were
collected inside the building. Levels were relatively
consistent among locations inside the facility, with no
specific areas exhibiting unusually high or low levels.
However, OSHA has not yet established PELs for either fungi
or bacteria, the study noted. To determine the ergonomics
factors involved in the facility, the evaluators videotaped
several operations in the facility's picking booth.

     They found only one potential ergonomics risk factor:
the work station's configuration, which required workers to
reach across the full width of the conveyor for picking and
sorting various recyclable items. The report is available

VARIABLE-RATE SYSTEMS REDUCE WASTE
VOLUME IN SEVERAL CAROLINA CITIES


     Several local governments in North Carolina have
lowered the amount of solid waste generated by up to 30
percent through charging customers for the volume of waste
they generate, rather than assessing a fixed fee, according
to the North Carolina Recycling Association (NCRA).

     The association surveyed several local governments in
that state that have converted to charging customers
variable rates based on the volume of waste they generate.
However, NCRA also reports there are several problems with
charging by the weight of solid waste generated.

     For example, Yadkin County, N.C., adopted a sticker-
based program in 1994 in which customers deliver trash in
their own 30-gallon bags to one of seven sites, NCRA said.
For additional trash, they can buy a 50-cent sticker for
each bag, and recyclables are accepted without charge.

     Yadkin County officials reported 30-percent reduction
in solid waste. Motine Kenney, solid waste coordinator for
that local government, said, "We did a countywide survey,
and people in the county said they'd rather go with a unit
price program than pay for someone else's garbage."

Wilmington Reports Waste Reduction

     In another example, the city of Wilmington, N.C.,
charges $12.90 per week to pick up a 90-gallon can of refuse
and $9.90 weekly for picking up a 40-gallon can. Excess
waste can be disposed of in 33-gallon bags that each cost
$1, and residents also can get twice weekly pickup of the
90-gallon can for $27.50.

     Wilmington officials reported a 10 percent reduction in
solid waste going to landfills, and a 42 percent increase in
both recycling and yard waste, NCRA said. However, NCRA also
reported the system there has created administrative
problems. In areas near low-income housing projects,
residents often dumped excess garbage in streets and into
commercial dumpsters, they said.

     Even after dropping the program for those low-income
housing projects, illegal dumping has increased in
Wilmington, according to Bill Reed, superintendent for
operations for Wilmington's solid waste department. "If you
institute a variable-rate program, be sure you have an
adequate enforcement mechanism set up," Reed cautions other
local governments.

     In another case cited by the state association, Jones
County in eastern North Carolina has operated a variable-
rate program based on volume since 1972. Under that system,
bags are sold wholesale to area businesses and then resold
to residential consumers for $1.25 each.

     The county has since added pickup of recyclables, which
are collected along with residential waste and stored in a
separate trailer towed by the refuse truck. Then, crews take
all materials collected to a transfer station, where the
waste is sent to a landfill and recyclables are sold.

     "It's been a good system for us," according to County
Manager Larry Matthews. "It's clean and it's well accepted
by our citizens. This was our first solid waste system, and
our first recycling system, so we can't really do a
comparison. But I'm sure it's an incentive to reduce and
recycle."

     However, those successful systems are based on the
volume of waste, rather than on its weight, NCRA stressed.
In addition, the association noted, there are several
drawbacks to charging residents by the weight of waste, so
there has been little interest in using that method.

     A primary obstacle to weight-based pricing has been
developing truck-mounted scales that can meet standards
developed by the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST), NCRA explained. For a typical residential
refuse can, NIST requires scales accurate to within a half
pound to two pounds, which can be difficult standard for
some local operations.

     Using those scales also adds to the processing time for
handling refuse, NCRA noted. In addition, those units cost
approximately $16,000 to retrofit per processor, NCRA said.

High Interest Level

     Despite some problems local governments have reported
with variable-rate systems, interest in those systems
remains high, the association also reported. Beth Graves, of
the North Carolina Office of Waste Reduction, said she
frequently gets calls from local governments interested in
pursuing  variable-rate programs and 80 North Carolina
officials participated in a satellite conference held on
those systems by EPA, NCRA noted.

     In addition, more local governments will consider using
variable-rate disposal fees as cost-cutting moves continue,
NCRA predicted. "I believe that unearthing the costs from
the general tax fund will provide tremendous incentives for
people to reduce their wastes," according to Craig Barry,
NCRA's Executive Director. Contact: NCRA, (919) 851-8444.

EPA OFFICIALS: BUDGET REDUCTIONS
COULD CAUSE MAJOR STAFF LAYOFFS


     Up to one-fourth of EPA's staff may be laid off by
spring unless congressional Republicans substantially
increase the agency's long-term funding that is independent
of the current federal shutdown, according to EPA
Administrator Carol Browner. That means it may take longer
for the agency to act on solid waste issues.

     About one-third of the employees who promulgate
regulations, issue permits and perform inspections could be
laid off if Congress eventually prevails on the EPA
appropriations bill vetoed by President Clinton, agency
officials also said.

     Researchers and employees involved in environmental
cleanups would not be cut. The statement is a break from
previous announcements, where EPA said it could not predict
the depth of the personnel reductions.

Bond Defends Cuts

     At a press conference, President Clinton said he vetoed
the $5.7 billion spending bill - that called for a 21
percent decrease from fiscal 1995 allocations - because
environmental enforcement would be cut 25 percent, safe
drinking water aid to local governments would be slashed 45
percent and the air would become more polluted. The cuts
also would condemn "10 million children under the age of 12
to living near toxic waste sites that might not be cleaned
up for years," Clinton said.

     The spending bill (H.R. 2099) contains six policy
riders designed to prevent EPA from acting in several areas,
along with a 50 percent cut in funding to implement the
Montreal treaty for protection of the ozone layer.

     In response to earlier attacks by Democrats on EPA
funding cuts, Sen. Christopher Bond (R-Mo.), chairman of the
appropriations subcommittee that handles the agency's
funding, said cuts in the agency's funding were based on
recommendations from several organizations, including the
National Academy of Public Administration.

SEVERAL SENATORS BACK LEGISLATION
FOR A 'MODEST' CWA MODIFICATION


     Key Senators on the Environment Committee support fine-
tuning the Clean Water Act (CWA) - and not the major
rollback of the law approved last year by the House.

     In the first of a series of hearings on reauthorizing
the CWA, Chairman John Chafee (R-R.I.) said he favors a
modest bill with a limited agenda. The Senate would be hard
pressed, he said, to pass a more ambitious package for
changing the CWA, such as H.R. 961, which the House approved
May 16, 1995.

     The CWA is a "major success story," said the panel's
ranking Democrat Max Baucus of Montana. House efforts to
"gut" it were "shortsighted, misdirected and wrongheaded,"
he said. "No CWA reauthorization would be better than the
one the House suggested."

     A frequent critic of environmental laws, Sen.
Christopher Bond (R-Mo.), said the CWA helped rehabilitate
the Mississippi River. Water quality has improved over the
past two decades, Bond said. Bond said he plans, however, to
"fix" CWA stormwater provisions he considers "broken." Local
entities and states should not be forced to spend exorbitant
sums, Bond added.

     "We have cities spending upwards of $650,000 to obtain
[stormwater discharge] permits. This expenditure does not
result in cleaner waters...Assessing humungous [CWA] fines
against small communities with limited resources is probably
the dumbest thing you can do if you want to improve the
environment," Bond said.

     Sen. Larry Pressler (R-S.D.) urged the committee to
consider his bill, S. 1390, that would allow CWA fines to be
invested in local pollution prevention and remediation.

     In order to make $2 billion in loans to states annually
for the next 30 years, $10 billion needs to be invested in
the wastewater state revolving fund (SRF) over the next
seven years, said Robert Perciasepe, head of EPA's water
office. President Clinton requested $1.59 billion in fiscal
1996 to support the SRF program.

     Actress Joanne Woodward will appear in a television
documentary and in radio and television public service
announcements (PSAs) to urge consumers to buy products made
from recycled materials and save landfill space, according
to the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF).

     EDF said Woodward has made a half-hour documentary
describing for consumers the life cycle of recycled products
and how to find recycled goods in their local supermarkets.

     EDF said it will make the documentary and PSAs
available to broadcasters, and also will provide the
documentary to schools and community groups. Contact: EDF,

BOTH PARTIES MISSED CHANCE TO CHANGE
ENVIRONMENTAL REGIME, ANALYST SAYS


     Both political parties share the blame for Congress
failing to pass meaningful reform of the nation's
environmental laws last year, including those that regulate
solid waste, according to an analysis done by Paul Portney,
president of Resources for the Future (RFF).

     Writing in the organization's publication, Resources,
Portney said the national debate over reform to require more
risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis for major federal
environmental statutes, including key parts of the safe
Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act, was framed
inaccurately. One side claimed the effort to require those
laws was an "heroic attempt to rescue the U.S. economy from
a welter of rules" made by unelected bureaucrats, Portney
said.

     The other side, led by congressional Democrats, argued
that the Republicans were making "thinly veiled effort" to
undo 25 years of environmental gains "just to benefit fat-
cat corporations," Portney's analysis said.

Both Sides Seen At Fault

     Portney contended that the Republicans "undermined
their own efforts" at regulatory reform by cutting EPA's
budget and tacking riders onto an appropriations bill to
prohibit the agency from enforcing some air and water
quality regulations.

     "If Congress thinks that particular regulations are
ill-advised, it can and should openly debate and change the
laws that gave rise to those regulations - not use the
appropriations process to make 'stealth' amendments," he
wrote.

     The Democrats, Portney added, also "bear responsibility
for the failure of regulatory reform" because they opposed
other measures backed by Republicans in the Senate and House
that would not have eliminated environmental regulations.

     Actually, he said, only the Senate bill would have
subjected existing regulations to any review at all, and
"even then, it would direct regulatory officials to undo
regulations only when they could not satisfy themselves that
their rules did more harm than good."

     Portney also wrote, "With the many possible advantages
of and reasonable concerns about the use of cost-benefit
analysis in regulation, the congressional debate ought to be
clear and focused."

     "Rather," he said, "the debate has been dominated by
false claims that regulation is strangling the economy or
that popular safeguards will be wiped off the books by
reform legislation."

     "We deserve and should insist upon more, though the
smart money is probably best wagered on more cartoon
caricatures," Portney concluded. Contact: RFF, (202) 328-
5025.

INDUSTRIAL PARK WOULD START CYCLE
OF LOCAL WASTE TO RAW MATERIALS


     Wastes generated by one company could become useful raw
materials for a nearby firm under the concept of an "Eco-
Industrial Park" (EIP) now in the planning stages in
Baltimore.

     According to the Cornell Center for the Environment,
the concept being developed in an industrial area of
Baltimore would allow one firm to acquire a new source of
profit while reducing its waste disposal and transportation
costs, while a nearby company gets a convenient source of
raw materials with the additional benefit of reducing its
costs for transporting those materials.

     The area has been designated as a demonstration site by
the President's Council for Sustainable Development.
Cornell's environment center proposed the project and is
involved in its planning and implementation through its Work
and Environment Initiative (WEI).

     According to a study done by WEI, petroleum-based
industries in Fairfield must dispose of a waste mixture of
oil and water, which then could be separated into usable oil
and water. In addition, construction and demolition debris
from industries there could be reprocessed into aggregate
for asphalt production, or refining landscape mulch from
wood.

     In turn, WEI said, those waste materials could be used
by new industries as part of their production process. WEI
said the project could attract more than $1 billion in new
investments and thousands of new jobs to the area. The
incentives for that investment, WEI said, would be
inherently high-performance companies, several modes of
transportation, and skilled workers. WEI said the project
could provide "a high return on assets for employers, an
improved local eco-system for the community and sustainable
high quality jobs."

     Edward Cohen-Rosenthal, WEI's director, said the
project had the potential of "marrying high workplace and
environmental practices" and increasing profits while also
decreasing waste and pollution." Contact: Edward Cohen-
Rosenthal, WEI, (607) 255-8160.

INDIANA SEEKS SUBTITLE D APPROVAL
AFTER YEARS OF FUNDING SHORTAGE


     Environmental officials in Indiana anticipate full EPA
approval of the state's solid waste program under Subtitle D
this summer, after years of delay.

     When severe budget cuts hit Indiana's solid waste
program in 1993, the U.S. EPA notified the Indiana
Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) officials that
approval of their state's Subtitle D program was contingent
on the Indiana agency finding sufficient funds to support
the program (SWR, Nov. 18, 1993).

     Funding dried up that year after IDEM ended the state
solid waste division's permit application and operation fee
programs because they resembled a water management program
fee structure that had been invalidated by a state court.

     Having straightened out funding problems, IDEM plans to
submit the application for complete approval of the Subtitle
D program this spring, and hopes for approval by summer,
according to Scott Dinwiddie, an official of the Indiana
Office of Solid and Hazardous Waste (OSHW).

     Meanwhile, OSHW has done considerable work to prepare
for that approval. Since 1994, the state has closed 10
municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLs), leaving the total
at 50.

     At the same time, the number of transfer stations has
grown to 48, according to the 1995 edition of the OSHW's
Summary of Indiana Solid Waste Facility Data. The state has
10 construction-demolition landfills, 17 restricted-waste
landfills, two incinerators and 49 composting facilities,
according to the government report. Except for a sharp
increase in 1992, the combined total annual disposal for all
landfill types remained fairly stable from 1991 through
1994, the document added.

     Despite the closing of several landfills, the total
remaining capacity at MSWLs has stayed fairly stable since
1991 because of landfill expansions, according to the
report. Indiana should have another decade of adequate
disposal at current facilities, OSHW predicted.

     Long-haul imports of trash, primarily from New York,
New Jersey and Pennsylvania, have declined since 1991, the
summary explained. However, OSHW said, total waste imports
from the bordering states of Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and
Kentucky have remained fairly steady, and exceed long-haul
imports. Waste shipments from Illinois comprise 75 percent
of Indiana's total waste imports. By 1994, 97 percent of the
waste imported to Indiana came from bordering states, the
state document also explained.

Recycling

     Indiana's laws require reducing materials going into
landfills through waste diversion, source reduction, reuse,
recycling and composting.

     The laws also require Indiana to reach an overall recy-
cling goal of 35 percent of the waste stream by Jan. 1,
1996, and they establish a goal of 50 percent due before
Jan. 1, 2001.

     OSHW's Dinwiddie said figures from 1995 are not
available on whether Indiana has met its recycling goal of
35 percent. By 1994's end, the state reached a 19 percent
waste reduction rate, he said.

     Copies of the report may be obtained from IDEM's Office
of Solid Waste Management, P.O. Box 6015, Indianapolis, IN
46206-6015, (317) 233-5156, or (317) 232-8885.

HYDRAPULPING CLAIMED TO INCREASE
RECYCLING OF ASEPTIC PACKAGING


     Recycling aseptic packaging, or those "drink boxes," is
increasing as the paper recycling process of hydrapulping
grows in use, according to reports from the Aseptic
Packaging Council (APC) (SWR, Dec. 14, p. 383).

     Since a pilot drink box recycling program began in
1990, the number of U.S. households recycling those
containers through curbside programs has grown to 5 million,
according to APC. Drink boxes are collected along with other
polyethylene-coated (laminated) paper products such as milk
cartons. Those products are then recycled using the
hydrapulping process.

     Hydrapulping separates the paper, which makes up 70
percent of the packaging, from the plastic and the aluminum.
The hydrapulper operates much like a large household
blender, says APC. The machinery is filled with water,
aseptic packages and milk and juice cartons, and large rotor
blades stir the water. The motion beats the paper fibers
away from the layers of polyethylene and aluminum foil.
Contact: APC, (703) 351-5062.

SPORTS COMPANY USES RECYCLABLES
TO MAKE BASKETBALL BACKBOARDS


     Huffy Sports (HS), manufacturer of home basketball
systems, is the first backboard producer to include post-
consumer materials in its products, according to the
company.

     Composite Technologies Corporation (CTC) of Dayton,
Ohio, produces the Polymer Fiber Matrix - a compression-
molded thermoplastics recycled resin - used in the boards.
CTC also manufacturers highway signs and walls for sound
barriers from Polymer Fiber Matrix.

     Recycled products used in the Polymer Fiber Matrix
include: PET soda bottles, milk jugs and industrial
plastics. HS plans to produce the majority of its backboards
from recycled materials by the end of 1996. Contact: Wendee

     NEW JERSEY - Environmental Resources Management (ERM)
recently completed its first full-scale installation of a
system based on its patented Advanced Fluidized Composting
(AFC) technology at a remediation site in Trenton, N.J. AFC
is a process technology used to treat high-strength organic
or biodegradable inorganic waste streams, or sludges. The
technology combines autothermal biological treatment of
high-strength organic waste streams with a proprietary
oxidation step. The result is a highly efficient rate of
organic destruction with little or no generation of waste
sludges commonly associated with most biological processes,
the company also explained. Contact: ERM, (800) 544-3117.

PRPs to bid Waste Inc. dump cap 

     PRPs are expected to solicit bids this spring or summer for the 
construction of an $11.3 million capping and leachate collection project at 
the Waste Inc. NPL site in Michigan City, Ind.
     A group of 16 PRPs known as the Waste Inc. Remedial Action 
Organization Group (WIROG) agreed last week to comply with an EPA 
unilateral order to design and build the remedy. 
     The 1994 ROD calls for capping most of the 32-acre landfill with two to 
four feet of compacted clay and one foot of topsoil. The cap will be graded 
and vegetated. 
     A leachate collection trench also will be needed at the southwest end of 
the landfill. Groundwater, which has polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and 
PCBs, will be monitored.
     Also, an on-site well will need to be abandoned, an underground fuel 
storage tank removed and a sewer system rerouted.
     Capital costs were estimated at $11.3 million under the ROD, with 
another $290,000 needed for annual operation and maintenance.
     Montgomery Watson's Addison, Ill., office is managing the site for the 
PRPs and will do the design. A design work plan is due Feb. 5. The 
consultant also is expected to handle the construction bid solicitations.
     The design is expected to be completed this spring or summer. Pre-
construction work could begin as early as April.

Bids near for CryoChem g.w. fix

     EPA is expected to solicit bids this spring for the construction of a 
groundwater treatment plant at the CryoChem Inc. NPL site in Worman, Pa.
     CH2M Hill Inc.'s Reston, Va., office is managing the fund-lead site as 
the agency's Alternative Remedial Contracts Strategy (ARCS) contractor. 
The design is at the 30% phase and is scheduled for completion in the 
spring. Construction is slated to begin this summer.
     Groundwater at the site will be extracted and treated with air stripping. 
Extraction and monitoring wells were installed last fall, and bids will be 
solicited for the construction of the on-site treatment building only. 
     Groundwater will be extracted at a maximum rate of 100 gallons per 
minute and discharged to an on-site creek.
     Groundwater samples taken between 1981 and 1985 at the 19-acre 
metal fabricating plant site revealed on-site and off-site contamination. The 
primary contaminants are TCA, DCA, TCE, DCE and PCE.

C&D Recycling pre-design starts

     PRPs have begun sampling as part of pre-design work for a $12 million 
soil and sediment cleanup at the C&D Recycling NPL site in Foster 
Township, Pa.
     ERM Northeast will design the remedy for AT&T, which is paying for 
the work under a unilateral administrative order. Other PRPs were identified 
by EPA but AT&T is the only one that complied with the order.
     Under the September 1992 ROD, about 30,000 cubic yards of soil and 
sediment will be excavated, stabilized and hauled off-site for disposal.
     The prime contaminants are heavy metals, primarily lead and copper.
     Design work is scheduled for completion in July 1997.
     The 45-acre site operated as metals reclamation plant from the 1960s 
until the early 1980s. Lead- and plastic-cased telephone cables were burned 
in pits to melt off the lead and reclaim the remaining copper wire. Plastic 
coverings were mechanically stripped prior to the burning and stored in 
piles at the site.
     The state found high concentrations of lead and copper in ash piles, the 
burn pit and drainage pathways.

AT&SF source removal eyed  

     EPA received a draft engineering evaluation/cost analysis (EE/CA) 
report Jan. 16 from PRPs at the Atchison Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad Co. 
(AT&SF) NPL site in Albuquerque, N.M., where a source soil and sludge 
removal likely is needed.
     The EE/CA is part of an RI/FS by Radian Corp. of Houston. Radian is 
doing the work for AT&SF, the only PRP identified by EPA.
     Possible removal options include excavation with off-site treatment of 
sludge and excavation, storage and on-site treatment of sludge with the rest 
of the site's contaminated soil. Contaminated soil extends to depths of 
about 40 feet, and the contamination has reached the bedrock aquifer.
     Sludge extends to depths of 1.5 feet to two feet. Earlier studies 
estimated about 1,000 cubic yards of sludge had to be addressed.
     The New Mexico Environment Dept. has the oversight lead at the site, 
which is an abandoned wood-preserving plant in the South Valley area of 
Albuquerque. Except for a waste water impoundment and sump, the plant 
was dismantled in 1972.

California Gulch capping eyed

     As expected, Asarco Inc. last week submitted a feasibility study for the 
Apache tailings operable unit at the California Gulch NPL site in 
Leadville, Colo., where about 600,000 cubic yards of tailings likely will 
need to be capped.
     The tailings could be capped with either soil or an impermeable clay 
layer at an estimated cost of between $1 million and $2 million, depending 
on which material is selected. The nature of the cap will be delineated 
during design.
     Asarco has not decided whether it will keep on Golder Associates 
Ltd., which did the RI/FS, to do the design or bid out the work. A decision 
is expected once the ROD is signed this spring. Asarco hopes to complete 
the work this summer.
     Community protection measures, such as blood lead screening, are 
expected for the residential soils operable unit. An FS for the unit is 
expected by the end of next month.
     Other operable units at the site are being addressed by Resurrection 
Mining Co. and Denver and Rio Grande Railroad (Superfund Week 
1/12).

More studies near at Valleycrest

     PRPs have completed sampling under the first phase of an RI at the 
North Sanitary Landfill NPL site (also called the Valleycrest Landfill) in 
Dayton, Ohio. The results are due next month.
     Phase two RI work will begin soon thereafter. During the first phase of 
the RI, about 10 groundwater monitoring wells were installed, along with 18 
soil gas probes. Landfill gas and geophysical surveys also were taken. 
     The geophysical surveys detected off-site burial areas, and much of 
second round of studies will focus on delineating those areas.
     The prime contaminants are volatile organic compounds, metals and 
semi-volatiles.
     TreaTek-Conestoga Rovers & Associates is doing the RI for a group 
of PRPs that agreed to an RI/FS last spring (Superfund Week 4/14/95). 
Parties agreeing to the investigations include General Motors Corp., 
AT&T Global Information Solutions, Cargill Inc., Duriron Co., 
Standard Register, Dayton Walther Co. and Peerless Transportation 
Co. Another 38 PRPs have been identified but have so far refused to step

Bloomington cleanup plans near

     EPA, the Indiana Dept. of Environmental Management and PRP 
Westinghouse Electric Corp. are expected to give a U.S. District Court a 
schedule next month for the cleanup of up to five PCB sites in 
Bloomington, Ind.
     Alternatives to incineration, which was selected for the sites in a 1985 
ROD, are expected to be proposed  at at least two of the five sites this year.
     The five sites are: Lemon Lane Landfill, Neal's Landfill, Neal's Dump, 
Bennett's Stone Quarry Dump and the Winston Thomas site. The Lemon 
Lane Landfill and Winston Thomas sites should be addressed in 1996. A 
review of each site's history, new studies and a draft cleanup schedule are 
due Feb. 13.
     The studies are being done in compliance with a state law requiring 
them before an on-site incineration permit can be issued. Westinghouse is 
about mid-way through the collection the data, which will supplement 
earlier RI/FS reports.
     The state hired PRC Environmental Management Co. to study 
solvent extraction, chemical dechlorination, biological remediation, quick 
lime treatment, low temperature thermal desorption, desorption with 
vaporization extraction and plasma torch technology.

North Bronson to get summer ROD

     EPA expects to sign a ROD in June for a soil and groundwater cleanup 
at the North Bronson Industrial Area NPL site in Bronson, Mich., where a 
less stringent cleanup than originally anticipated might be allowed because 
of changes in state cleanup level requirements.
     The state is reevaluating Montgomery Watson's fund-lead FS because 
the studies were conducted before changes in the state law with regard to 
cancer risks. Last summer the state changed its cancer risk level from 10 -6 
to 10 -5.
     A ROD originally was scheduled for last summer. Another factor in the 
delay is that an industrial sewer system, which  connected two wastewater 
lagoons, was not evaluated as part of the RI/FS. Additional investigations 
might be required to further delineate the definition of the site. If more 
investigations are needed, the state likely will use Montgomery Watson of 
Novine, Mich.
     Two former industrial waste lagoon areas constructed by the City of 
Bronson around 1940 need to be cleaned up, along with groundwater 
contaminated by the lagoons and at least one other source area (Superfund 
Week 9/1/95).

A.I.W. Frank g.w. talks delayed

     EPA is expected to begin negotiations this month for the design and 
construction of a portion of a $10.9 million soil and groundwater cleanup at 
the A.I.W. Frank/Mid-County Mustang NPL site in Exton, Pa. The talks 
were delayed by the recent federal furlough.
     Under the ROD signed in September, a groundwater pump-and-
treatment system with air stripping will be needed to treated solvents-
contaminated groundwater. 
     About a half-dozen wells will extract contaminated groundwater from a 
fractured bedrock aquifer. Treatment will continue for about 30 years.
     The only apparent discharge point for treated groundwater is a nearby 
river, but since the river is a trout stream EPA has left flexibility in 
the plan and is evaluating other options.
     Also, about 230 cubic yards of contaminated source soil needs to be 
excavated and disposed off-site. The soil is located at a former waste 
solvent tank storage area.
     A building demolition project and a small drum removal also is 
required.
     The entire cleanup will cost about $10.9 million, most of which (about 
$6 million) will be required for the groundwater cleanup. Design work is 
expected to begin in 1997.

Nature to clean up Chevron g.w.

     EPA proposed natural attenuation and monitoring for pesticide-
contaminated groundwater at the Chevron Chemical Co. site in Orlando, 
Fla., where a ROD should be signed this spring.
     The plan contains a contingency for a barrier wall and air sparging if 
contamination levels do not decrease quickly enough. Samples will be 
taken quarterly to see if levels of xylene and alpha-BHC are dropping by 
10% to 15%.
     If levels do not decrease, a permeable filter wall will be used with 
limited air sparging or a hydraulic containment system. Monitoring is 
expected to last eight to ten years.
     The proposed plan is expected to cost $247,700 if natural attenuation 
works. The contingency will cost about $1.3 million.
     Chevron completed two removal actions to address soil contamination 
at the site. In 1991, the company removed 18,000 tons of pesticide-
contaminated soil at the plant property, and in 1994 230 tons of soil were 
removed from an adjacent trailer park.
     A pesticide formation plant operated at the site between 1950 and 1976. 
The contaminants of concern were chlordane, DDT, parathion and 
petroleum hydrocarbons.

Bids near for $34M Vineland pump-treat

     EPA is expected to solicit bids this spring or summer for the 
construction of a groundwater pump-and-treatment system at the 
Vineland Chemical Co. Inc. NPL site in Vineland, N.J.
     Under the September 1989 ROD, about a dozen wells will be 
needed to extract contaminated groundwater at a rate of about two 
million gallons per day. Metals precipitation will be the primary 
treatment, and treated groundwater will be reinjected back into the 
aquifer as much as possible and/or discharged to a nearby river.  
     The cleanup is estimated at $34 million, including operation and 
maintenance costs.
     Arsenic is the primary contaminant of concern.
     The Army Corps of Engineers' Kansas City Dist. is handling the 
design for EPA and will solicit the construction bids. After a 
contract award, management of the cleanup will be deferred to the 
Corps' Philadelphia Dist. 
     Malcolm Pirnie Inc.'s White Plains, N.Y., office is designing 
the remedy under contract with the Corps. The design now stands at 
about 65% complete. Construction bids are scheduled to go out in 
May or June and will be advertised in the Commerce Business 
Daily, EPA said.

Soil cleanup takes back burner

     The cleanup of about 126,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil 
will be addressed after the groundwater cleanup, which EPA 
decided to make a priority to halt the off-site migration of arsenic.
     The ROD called for the ex-situ soil flushing of about 126,000 
cubic yards of arsenic-contaminated soil. But last spring design 
work for a soil washing cleanup was put on hold at about the 65% 
stage so other potentially more cost-effective technologies could be 
evaluated (Superfund Week 4/7/95).
     EPA treatability studies showed ex-situ soil washing will be 
more effective than soil flushing. Malcolm Pirnie did bench-scale 
column leaching tests on soil flushing and determined that due to 
chemical properties in the soil, flushing will not achieve the 
agency's surface cleanup goal of 20 parts per million (ppm) for 
arsenic in the top two feet of soil. The subsurface cleanup goal is 
120 ppm. 
     Therefore the plan was to excavate the soil and run it through a 
portable soil washing agitator, or hydroclone, to break the weak 
ferrous oxide bond of arsenic on soil particles and have the arsenic 
come off in the rinse water. But this would require much more 
money than the agency expected when the ROD was signed. The 
ROD estimated the soil and groundwater cleanups at $66 million.
     EPA will make a soil cleanup decision after the groundwater is 
addressed.
     The ROD also calls for the soil washing of contaminated river 
sediments. That cleanup also will take place after the groundwater 
is remediated.
     Arsenic salts were stored in open piles and in chicken coops at 
the 20-acre herbicide plant site at 1611 W. Wheat Rd. in 
Cumberland County. Untreated process wastes were discharged into 
lagoons. About 38 miles of watershed was contaminated with 
arsenic. The site made the NPL in September 1984.

Ottati & Goss g.w. bids eyed for summer

     EPA is expected to solicit bids this summer for the construction 
of a groundwater pump-and-treatment system at the Ottati & 
Goss/Great Lakes Container Corp. NPL site in Kingston, N.H., 
pending resolution of the Superfund budget.
     Another issue to be resolved before any bids are solicited is 
whether to pump-and-treat groundwater below a wetlands area at the 
site.
     Arthur D. Little Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., is designing the 
cleanup as EPA's Alternative Remedial Contracts Strategy (ARCS) 
contractor. The 90% design was reached in October 1995 but has 
since been stalled due to the budget and wetlands issues.
     The January 1987 ROD called for the installation of extraction 
wells in the wetlands area, but EPA's hopes a planned source soil 
cleanup will allow for the natural attenuation of groundwater there.
     Additional soil and sediment sampling was completed last 
month, and the agency expects to make a determination on the 
wetlands issue by mid-February. Contaminated wetlands sediments 
also need to be addressed, and EPA indicated it wants to 
synchronize a sediment cleanup with any installation of 
groundwater extraction wells to avoid having to disturb the wetlands 
more than once.
     In any case, wells will be needed in the plant site area. Design 
of the cleanup is scheduled to be completed late this spring. The 
ROD estimates the remedy at between $4 million and $6 million.
     The overburden aquifer is contaminated with volatile organic 
compounds and metals. The plume starts about 30 feet below the 
surface and stretches some 800 feet, flowing west to east. Although 
the plume has migrated off-site, contamination has diluted and the 
migration of contaminants has leveled off.
     After treatment, groundwater will be reinjected into the 
overburden aquifer via recharge trenching. A leach field similar to 
that of a septic system will be used.

Innovative soil technology still needed

     Between 10,000 and 15,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil 
need to be addressed. The ROD originally called for the incineration 
of all contaminated soil and sediment, but the burn was shelved last 
spring due to community opposition (Superfund Week 4/21/95). 
     At about that time EPA indicated it was open to any technology 
that treats PCBs and volatile organics in soil. No technology has 
been selected, however, and the agency said it is still open to 
proposals. Depending on the technology eventually chosen, 
treatability tests might be needed.
     EPA repeatedly has pulled back on incineration plans at 
Superfund sites around the nation, but generally appears willing to 
go with thermal desorption.

Buckeye cap, wetlands talks under way

     EPA has begun preliminary negotiations with PRPs for a cap, 
constructed wetlands and french drain cleanup at the Buckeye 
Reclamation NPL site in St. Clairsville, Ohio, where the PRPs want 
to make some changes to the design.
     Neither EPA or a PRP representative would elaborate on the 
potential changes. 
     Under the $48.6 million August 1991 ROD, a solid waste cap is 
needed to cover a 66-acre waste disposal area. The cap will need to 
have a permeability of no less than 10 -7 centimeters/second and 
will consist of topsoil, a drainage layer, two feet of clay and a 
grading layer. No liner will be needed.
     The wetlands will have curves to slow the flow of water through 
them. Cattails will be planted on a compost carpet and an 
underlying plastic liner to keep contaminated water from seeping 
below ground.
     Environmental Strategies Corp. of Pittsburgh and Baker & 
Associates of Corapolis, Pa., designed the remedy for about 15 
PRPs on the Buckeye Steering Committee. The steering committee 
is headed by Consol Inc., a Pittsburgh-based coal mining company. 
Most of the PRPs were hazardous waste generators, including a 
number of steel makers.
     Volatile organic compounds and heavy metals are the prime 
contaminants of concern.
     The design estimates the cleanup at only about $21 million, but 
EPA said the design did not address some aspects of the cleanup, 
such as groundwater monitoring.
     Construction of the remedy was scheduled to begin this spring or 
summer but EPA indicated the work is not likely to get under way 
this construction season.
     The site was used for the disposal of coal mine spoils. In 1971 
the Ohio Dept. of Health licensed the site as a sanitary landfill. 
Between 1976 and 1979, the site also received industrial wastes 
including sludges and liquids. Industrial and asbestos wastes were 
dumped in the waste disposal area, where high levels of volatiles 
and heavy metals have been detected. The site made the NPL in 
September 1983.

Raymark cap construction subs needed

     Design is under way for a cap, gas collection and non-aqueous 
phase liquid (NAPL) cleanup at the Raymark Industries Inc. NPL 
site in Stratford, Conn., where subcontractors will be needed as 
construction of the remedy nears this spring.
     Foster Wheeler Environmental Corp. is doing the design 
under a Total Environmental Restoration Contract (TERC) with the 
Army Corps of Engineers. The Corps is managing the $60 million 
cleanup for EPA.
     Foster Wheeler will construct the cap under the TERC, but 
subcontractors will be needed to install NAPL extraction wells and 
to provide capping materials and site stabilization.
     The cap will cover 33 acres at a capital cost of about $25 
million. The cover will consist of a one-foot sand layer with 
perforated piping to vent gas, a geosynthetic clay liner, a flexible 
membrane liner, a geonet drainage layer and some select fill. Gas 
will be treated on-site in two treatment buildings. Cap construction 
should be complete by September.
     Bids for six- to eight-inch extraction wells screened at various 
depths likely will be solicited in March. The NAPL will be 
collected in tanks and taken off-site for treatment. The number of 
NAPL extraction wells needed has yet to be determined.
     Also still to be determined is the stabilization technology for the 
landfill. The Corps is considering pilings, surcharging peat and deep 
dynamic compaction and is expected to make a determination by 
the end of this month. Stabilization work could cost up to $5 
million. 
     The cleanup was outlined in a July 1995 ROD.      
     The cleanup of 37 residential properties was completed in 
September, and the wastes were stored on-site. About 100,000 cubic 
yards of contaminated material from the residential cleanup needs 
to be treated to reduce moisture before it is placed under the cap 
(Superfund Week 7/21/95). 
     Foster Wheeler is about one-third done with the demolition of 
buildings at the 15-acre site. That work is scheduled for completion 
in March.
     Raymark Industries Inc. manufactured asbestos-based products at 
the site and used PCB- and heavy metals-laden waste as yard fill 
throughout the town.

American Creosote design underway

     EPA has begun design of a dense non-aqueous phase liquid 
(DNAPL) recovery system at the American Creosote Works 
(Pensacola Pit) NPL site in Pensacola, Fla. 
     The 1994 ROD called for enhanced DNAPL recovery via water 
injection, but preliminary groundwater design studies determined 
direct pumping was the most effective treatment. About 2 million 
gallons of DNAPL need to be addressed. The ROD estimated the 
remedy at $5.8 million.      
     The ROD also called for groundwater treatment via in-situ and 
ex-situ biological treatment, but EPA is expected to amend the 
ROD to allow scrapping biological treatment if the discharged 
groundwater meets alternative concentration limits. Groundwater 
will be surface discharged and monitored.      Bechtel 
Environmental is working on the fund-lead design, which is due 
late this spring. EPA does not yet have funds to do the work.
     For the source control operable unit, EPA is developing an 
amendment to a 1989 ROD, which selected biological treatment for 
100,000 cubic yards of surface soil and sediment.
     Treatability studies indicated biological treatment was not 
effective on PAHs, and EPA likely will propose thermal desorption 
as an alternative. Along with PAHs, the soil and sediment also have 
PCP and dioxin.
     A creosote plant operated at the 18-acre site from 1902 to 1981. 
Process wastewater was discharged into two unlined, on-surface 
impoundments. Under an emergency cleanup in 1983, EPA 
dewatered the two ponds, treated the water with coagulation and 
filtration and discharged treated water to the city sewer system.

Lexington cap to get summer bid

     Design is complete for a landfill cap at the Lexington County Landfill 
Area NPL site in Cayce, S.C., and the county is expected to solicit bids for 
construction of the remedy this summer.
     Lexington County agreed to pay for the cleanup, which is estimated at 
$3.5 million in capital costs. Bids will go out once the county completes its 
fiscal year 1997 (which begins in July) budget.
     The 20- to 30-acre cap will consist of 18 inches of cover material -- six 
inches of shredded tires and 12 inches of soil. Also, one portion of the 
landfill needs to be relocated and some garbage removal services will be 
needed.
     An existing gas recovery system not now in use might be converted to a 
passive methane gas collection system.
     The design was completed by G.N. Richardson of Raleigh, N.C.
     Two groundwater extraction wells have been installed at the site and 
will be used to treat about 25,000 gallons of water per day. Groundwater 
will be shipped to either a publicly owned treatment plant or used for 
irrigation.

EPA to bid Arrowhead soil removal

     CH2M Hill's Milwaukee office is expected to solicit bids next month 
from a pool of 16 pre-qualified contractors for the removal of lead-
contaminated soil at the Arrowhead Refinery NPL site near Duluth, Minn. 
     About 27,000 cubic yards of visually-contaminated soil,  sediment and 
buried refuse will be excavated and taken off-site for disposal.
     EPA had expected to bid out the work last year, but the project was 
stalled because of budget cuts (Superfund Week 8/25/95).
     In November 1995, EPA approved $3 million in fund money to clean up 
the site. Another $2.39 million left over from previous site cleanup work 
will be used for the project. 
     A contract will be awarded in April and the work should be completed 
this summer. The work originally was estimated at between $4 million and 
$8 million.
     The Arrowhead Remedial Action Group has nearly completed the 
cleanup of a sludge lagoon area. Demobilization is scheduled for February 
or March.

NL Industries cap, g.w. design due in spring

     EPA has gone ahead with the design of a capping and 
groundwater containment cleanup at the NL Industries/Taracorp 
NPL site in Granite City, Ill., as PRP negotiations continue.
     Woodward Clyde Consultants is designing the remedy for 
EPA. Design work should be completed this spring.
     The cleanup will include the installation of a series of on-site 
extraction wells to contain metals-contaminated groundwater. 
Groundwater will be treated, if necessary, and discharged to a local 
sewer system. 
     Additional monitoring wells would be installed downgradient 
from the existing wells, where high lead or cadmium levels have 
been found. Additional monitoring wells would be installed in the 
remote fill areas, also.
     The groundwater fix will cost about $3 million and take between 
two and four months to implement.
     EPA also considered installing a slurry wall on the perimeter of 
the main industrial area to prevent off-site groundwater migration, 
but that would cost more than $18 million.
     Groundwater monitoring to detect any off-site migration will also 
be required, along with long-term air monitoring.
     No groundwater contamination had been identified when the 
ROD was signed (Superfund Week 10/21/94). But additional 
sampling in late 1992 confirmed site groundwater to be 
contaminated with lead.
     The 1990 ROD also requires the excavation of a slag pile and 
combining it with the main Taracorp pile. Soil from the main 
industrial area with lead concentrations above 1,000 parts per 
million and any soil containing hard rubber battery casings will be 
excavated and added to the new lined section of the main Taracorp 
pile. 
     The slag will then be covered with a multi-layer cap. A three-
foot layer of compacted clay would be used as a liner for the cap. 
The excavated area will be backfilled and topped with sod or 
asphalt.
     The source removal will cost about $4.8 million and take nine to 
15 months to conduct.
     Under criticism from town residents and officials for proposing to 
dispose of contaminated materials on an existing slag pile near City 
Hall, EPA changed the ROD in 1993 and 1994.
     The agency also considered excavating the slag and sending it 
to an off-site hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal 
facility, but that would have cost more than $64 million. Also 
considered was building a landfill on-site to dispose of the slag, but 
that option would have cost about $29 million.
     Meanwhile, cleanups at remote fill residential areas have nearly 
been completed. Fill containing hard rubber battery casings is being 
excavated and segregated into hazardous and non-hazardous groups. 
Hazardous materials are being stabilized and disposed at an off-site 
landfill. Non-hazardous materials are being taken directly to an off-
site landfill. The excavated areas will be backfilled with soil or 
clean fill and capped. Contaminated fill in driveways or alleys is 
being capped with asphalt. 
     That work will end up costing between $1.3 and $1.4 million.

Escambia Wood resident relocation eyed 

     A second round of RI sampling is set to begin this month at the 
Escambia Wood Treating Co. NPL site in Pensacola, Fla., where 
EPA is considering permanently relocating nearby residents as part 
of an interim action.
     EPA is evaluating relocation options for 300 households with 
contaminated soil. The agency might propose a relocation plan this 
spring. Four areas are being targeted as part of a fast track 
relocation investigation. Permanent relocation of all the residents 
has been estimated at $23 million.
     However, EPA does not have funding for the relocation or any 
additional remedial action, so any cleanup work might be put on 
hold until fiscal year 1997.
     Meanwhile, a site-wide RI/FS, which began in November, is 
continuing to determine the nature and extent of soil and 
groundwater contamination. Thermal treatment and off-site disposal 
options will be considered.

Alternatives to soil burn needed

     Contaminants of concern include PCP, creosote, PAHs, dioxin 
and arsenic. 
     Also, a pile of 250,000 cubic yards of dioxin-contaminated soil, 
which was stockpiled during a removal in the early 1990s, needs to 
be investigated. The stockpile has the worst kind of dioxin (2,3,7,8-
TCDD) at levels as high as 12,000 parts per million. Creosote has 
been detected in the thousands of parts per million range. 
     The soil was excavated to stop leaching to groundwater, but no 
additional action was taken after residents objected to incineration 
of the stockpile in 1992 (Superfund Week 10/2/92). EPA estimated 
the cost of incineration at $40 million in 1994.
     Dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) contamination is 
suspected in a quarter-mile plume that runs from the site to the 
downgradient Agrico NPL site.
     The RI/FS should be complete by February 1997. CDM Federal 
Programs Corp. is doing the studies as an EPA Region 4 
Alternative Remedial Contracts Strategy (ARCS) contractor 
(Superfund Week 1/27/95).
     The 26-acre site is located on the north edge of the Pensacola 
city limits and is the target of an environmental  justice initiative 
because a minority neighborhood is on the north side.

Bill would give Corps all fund-lead work

     Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J., entered a bill in the House 
last month to give the Army Corps of Engineers contract oversight 
of all fund-financed Superfund cleanups.
     A staffer for Frelinghuysen said the bill has been referred to the 
House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which is 
expected to take up the bill shortly after Congress returns on Jan. 22. 
Frelinghuysen is a member of the Appropriations energy and water 
development subcommittee, which has heavy oversight of the 
Corps. He is also a member of the VA-HUD and independent 
agencies subcommittee, under which CERCLA is funded.
     Once EPA selects a remedy at an NPL site, it tasks the Corps to 
manage the cleanup about 35% of the time. Frelinghuysen wants 
that percentage upped to 100%, saying giving the Corps 
management responsibility will "speed cleanups, reduce overhead, 
and provide better management of Superfund cleanups."

Focus is on Corps, EPA strengths

     "My bill would mandate that all contracting oversight of site 
cleanups under the Superfund program be managed by [the Corps]," 
Frelinghuysen said. He added it will "simply let EPA do what it 
does best, which is scientific analysis and site characterization. 
Once a remedy is selected, it then brings in [the Corps] to do what 
they do best, which is to manage large, complex construction 
projects."
     The House freshman, who served 13 years in the state 
legislature, represents New Jersey's 11th district, which has 13 
Superfund sites -- more than any other congressional district in the 
nation.
     H.R. 2801, the Site Clean-up Improvement and Acceleration Act 
of 1995, amends Section 104 of CERCLA.
     The bill says: "Except in the case of remedial actions carried 
out by a state or political subdivision ..., contract administration of 
awarded contracts for design and construction associated with fund-
lead remedial actions commenced ... after the date of enactment ... 
shall be performed by [the Corps.]"
     However, any such changes to the program have to make it 
through the House environment subcommittee, which has 
jurisdiction over Superfund. Rep. Mike Oxley, R-Ohio, who chairs 
the subcommittee, previously has said he wants to minimize fund-
lead cleanup projects and the Corps' role in Superfund (Superfund 
Week 3/31/95).

EPA proposes Spokane stabilization, cap

     EPA proposed a $1.7 million to $2.3 million soil stabilization 
and capping project as part of a removal action at the Spokane 
Junkyard/Associated Properties NPL site in Spokane, Wash.
     Under the recommended alternative, all soil above residential 
cleanup levels (400 parts per million for lead, 1 ppm for PCBs) will 
be excavated and consolidated on the Spokane Metals property. 
     Soil above 5,000 ppm lead will be treated with chemical 
stabilization. The stabilized soil will be consolidated with soil with 
contamination levels between 400 and 5,000 ppm, which will not be 
treated, and capped with a geomembrane and soil cover.
     The 5,000 ppm standard will require that only about half as 
much material be stabilized as would be using the industrial lead 
level of 1,000 ppm.
     Other options EPA is considering include excavation and off-site 
disposal of all contaminated soil; off-site disposal of soil above 
industrial levels and capping of soil above residential levels; and 
capping of all soil above residential levels. The most expensive 
option, at between $6.8 million and $8.1 million, is off-site disposal 
of all soil above residential cleanup levels.
     Lead is found in surface soil on most of the site and PCBs are 
found sporadically in surface soil. The site has been zoned for 
residential use with the exception of the former Spokane Metals 
property. Between 8,000 and 15,000 cubic yards of contaminated 
soil will need to be addressed.
     EPA will make a decision on cleanup options after the comment 
period closes Feb. 16.
     The PRPs agreed to design the removal but another settlement 
will be needed for construction of the project.
     The PRPs at the site, Kaiser Aluminum, Washington Water 
Power, and Inland Power and Light submitted an EE/CA for the 
removal in December 1995 (Superfund Week 12/8/95). Alta 
Geosciences of Battelle, Wash., did the EE/CA.
     The 16-acre site is located in a light commercial and residential 
area. Asbestos and drums of hazardous wastes were removed and 
taken to an approved hazardous waste facility in 1987.

Correction

     A brief on the Boerke site in Wisconsin in the Jan. 12 edition of 
Superfund Week incorrectly stated when the site's dye manufacturing plant 
closed. The plant closed in 1938.
     Also, a story in the Dec. 22 issue incorrectly stated who is doing a 
cleanup design at the Cleveland Mill site in New Mexico. Adrian Brown 
Consultants' Salt Lake City office is handling all of the design work.

Wyckoff/Eagle Harbor to get near-shore fill

     EPA has signed a ROD amendment that calls for construction of 
a near-shore fill and solidification of soil and sediments at the 
Wyckoff/Eagle Harbor NPL site in Bainbridge Island, Wash.
     Under the amendment, hot spot sediments will be placed in a 
confined disposal facility (CDF) and capped with clean material 
and asphalt. The one-acre fill will be built adjacent to the former 
shipyard. EPA proposed the change in September (Superfund Week 
9/29/95).
     Under the 1992 ROD, heavy metal hot spot soil and sediments 
were to be disposed in a hazardous waste or municipal landfill. 
     The amendment came largely in response to community 
concerns that a private boatyard would be forced to leave the harbor 
under the original cleanup plan. The fill will create nearly one acre 
of additional land that the Washington State Dept. of 
Transportation  (WSDOT) has committed to lease for private 
water operations. 
     A drainage system will be needed to prevent surface and 
groundwater from leaching into the harbor. 
     Also, a habitat migration plan will be needed. The outer walls of 
the CDF will be enhanced with gravel to provided a favorable 
habitat for barnacles and mussels.
     The primary contaminants at the site are PAHs and mercury.
     Design efforts begun by PRPs PACCAR Inc. and WSDOT will 
resume now that EPA has agreed to the near-shore fill. Hart-
Crowser Inc. is designing the cleanup for the PRPs and has 
submitted the 35% design. A final design should be complete early 
this summer, at which time EPA will begin negotiations with the 
PRPs for construction of the cleanup. In addition to PACCAR and 
WSDOT, the Washington Dept. of Natural Resources and the 
U.S. Dept. of Defense are potentially liable parties. The cleanup 
will cost about $4 million.
     Also at the Wyckoff site, building demolition is expected to be 
completed early in the spring. EPA recently replaced the wells in a 
groundwater pump-and-treatment system that has been operating 
since 1990. The system uses physical separation of oil from the 
water, biological treatment and carbon adsorption to treat about 100 
gallons per minute.
     CH2M Hill is doing an RI/FS at the facility, which should be 
completed sometime this year.  
     The design of an interim groundwater barrier wall to prevent 
water from reaching the harbor, prescribed in a 1994 ROD, is 
awaiting funding in addition to the RI results.

Senate mulls liability deal

     Senate Republicans soon could take up a reauthorization proposal 
freeing PRPs at multi-party sites from the Superfund liability net.
     Sources say GOP staff members have recommended the measure as the 
one for which the most broad-based support could be garnered. The move 
comes light of the disastrous response to other recently proposed liability 
exemptions such as the retroactive liability discount (RLD) and tax credits 
for PRPs. Sources said neither of those provisions are likely to be in a 
reauthorization bill.
   Included in a House proposal issued last fall was a provision for liability 
shielding at municipal landfill NPL sites (Superfund Week 9/29/95), an idea 
that has drawn less fiery criticism and is viewed by many as the best 
compromise. 
     The move reportedly eliminates about 250 sites from the Superfund 
liability scheme.
     However, even if an agreement can be reached on the multi-party 
liability exemption, issues such as clearly defining "multi-party sites" and 
setting a cut-off date for the repeal will remain to be worked out. Sources 
said the Senate plan most likely will include municipal landfills and other 
sites at which there are dozens or hundreds of small contributors and have 
1981 as the cut-off date.
     House leaders are batting around similar liability exemptions 
(Superfund Week 1/5).

N.J. reps: restore CERCLA funding

     All thirteen New Jersey representatives have signed a letter asking 
House Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Livingston, R-La., to 
include Superfund in a targeted appropriations bill and restore Superfund to 
full 1995 funding.
     Under the continuing resolution, EPA is operating at 75% of its 1995 
budget, a level the letter calls "unacceptable." New Jersey has 114 
Superfund sites, more than any other state.
     The delegation calls for Superfund to be included in targeted 
appropriations bills that will fund selected programs for fiscal 1996 in the 
absence of a budget agreement.
     "The disarray that the Superfund program has been put through in recent 
weeks, as a direct result of the EPA's appropriations not having been 
enacted yet, threatens the program's underlying integrity and credibility," 
the letter stated.
     Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., leading the New Jersey move said: "The 
104th Congress must take prompt action to remedy the situation by 
approving legislation that President Clinton will sign into law that provides 
the EPA with the needed funds."

U.S. APPEALS COURT AFFIRMS RULING THAT INDIANA COAL LAW IS
UNCONSTITUTIONAL

   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has affirmed a lower court ruling
that struck down portions of an Indiana law that encourages the state's
electric utilities to find ways to burn high-sulfur coal and still comply
with the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments.
   In a Dec. 22 ruling (Case No. 95-2065), the appeals court said parts of
the 1991 law, passed in response to the Clean Air Act and strongly
supported by an Indiana high-sulfur coal industry that feared an influx of
low-sulfur Western coal, violate the Interstate Commerce Clause of the
Constitution and therefore are unconstitutional.
   Under the Indiana Environmental Compliance Plan Act (ECPA), the state
Utility Regulatory Commission can pre-approve a utility's Clean Air Act
compliance plan, but only if several criteria are met. One of the key
provisions is whether the utility will continue or increase its use of
Indiana high-sulfur coal.
   In challenging the legality of the law, the Alliance for Clean Coal
(ACC), a coalition of Western coal producers and railroads, has argued that
such a provision amounts to illegal protectionism and violates the
Constitution.
   Last March, U.S. District Judge John Tinder found that portions of the
Indiana law violate the Interstate Commerce Clause and should be
invalidated (UER, 14 April '95, 3).
   The appeals court concurred, saying a utility compliance plan that has a
negative impact on Indiana coal is ``subject to continuing annual
surveillance'' by the URC under the Indiana law.
   As a result, those portions of the ECPA ``discriminate against
interstate commerce based solely upon geographic origin...the clear intent
of the statute is to benefit Indiana coal at the expense of Western coal,''
the appeals court said.
   The fact that the Indiana law ``merely encourages'' utilities to use
high-sulfur coal does not make it ``any less discriminatory,'' the appeals
court said. The result, the court added, is ``discriminatory state action
that is forbidden by the Commerce Clause.''
   Concluded the court: ``Despite the fact that low-sulfur Western coal may
be a more efficient compliance option, the ECPA clearly attempts to prevent
Indiana electrical utilities from switching to low-sulfur coal. This
amounts to discriminatory state action that is forbidden by the Commerce
Clause. The defendants have not discharged their burden of demonstrating
that the statute serves a legitimate and compelling interest unrelated to
economic protectionism.''
   A spokesman for the Indiana Coal Council, a major supporter of the
Indiana law, said he was not surprised by the ruling. Indiana is not
expected to appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Terry O'Connor, vice president of government relations for ARCO Coal, an
ACC member, said the group expects to win a similar lawsuit it filed late
last year in Ohio (UER, 29 Sept '95, 1).
   Asked what the ACC hopes to gain by the Indiana victory, O'Connor said
the rewards would not be immediate. ``We recognize that utilities in the
various Midwestern states have already made their Phase-One [compliance]
decisions'' under the acid rain rules, he said.
   However, ``to the extent that those decisions may have been skewed by
the Indiana protectionist law, we're hopeful that those utilities will now
feel free to revisit those fuel decisions and look westward to inexpensive,
low-sulfur coal.''
   In the long run, the ACC hopes to pick up additional business when
Midwest utilities finalize Phase-Two compliance plans. ``With this decision
now hopefully behind us, we are optimistic that as Illinois, Indiana and
Ohio utilities prepare Phase-Two compliance plans for submission [to
regulatory agencies] in the next year or so, they will look favorably on
Western coal as a viable option,'' O'Connor said.
   A spokeswoman for PSI Energy, which is building a Phase-One scrubber at
its 3,149-MW Gibson plant near Princeton, Ind., doubted the appeals court
ruling would have much impact on her company.
   ``Since we didn't rely on the [ECPA] for Phase One, the ruling probably
won't have a great effect on PSI for Phase-Two plans,'' she said. ``But it
might eliminate some steps in the future that we might have had to go
through.''

CALIF. PUC TO STUDY ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF RESTRUCTURING ORDER

   The California Public Utilities Commission has decided to conduct an
environmental impact report to assess potential environmental damage from
the move to a competitive electric power industry.
   In issuing its final electric restructuring order last month, the PUC
agreed to conduct an EIR under the California Environmental Quality Act.
``The magnitude of our proposed electric policy favors reviewing the
possible environmental impacts of a new industry structure,'' the PUC
stated.
   The PUC responded to a motion filed by the Natural Resources Defense
Council in June 1994 for determining whether CEQA applied to the
commission's electric restructuring proceeding. The PUC noted that parties
disagreed whether electric restructuring fit within the CEQA definition of
a project and thus triggered the CEQA requirements for an EIR.
   While the California Supreme Court has interpreted CEQA's definition of
a project as not requiring a finding of a direct physical effect on the
environment, the courts have not clarified whether policy actions without
direct environmental effects are CEQA projects. ``We cannot make a finding
at this time about whether electric restructuring constitutes a CEQA
project,'' the PUC conceded. ``However, we can anticipate that there is no
harm, and abundant good, in moving forth with analysis under CEQA at this
time.'' The commission cautioned that delaying the preparation of an EIR
could severely hamper restructuring efforts, which it deemed vital to the
state's economy.
   In its restructuring order, the PUC adopted president Daniel Fessler's
proposal to create simultaneously an independent system operator to control
transmission, a wholesale power exchange and direct access phased-in over
five years beginning Jan. 1, 1998.
   The PUC established a five-year transition period to a competitive
industry, with a non-bypassable competitive transition charge, or CTC, on
all retail customers to ensure utilities full recovery of their stranded
investments by 2005.
   The PUC determined that preparation of an EIR rather than a negative
declaration was necessary because electric restructuring may potentially
impact the environment in several ways. The PUC cited NRDC's concern that
electric restructuring may reduce energy efficiency incentives and restore
the linkage between utilities' profits and sales volumes, which have been
decoupled by the Electric Revenue Adjustment Mechanism.
   The PUC also cited Pacific Gas and Electric's observation that electric
restructuring may result in shifts in energy production, resulting in a
different mix of energy resources with a potential for creating
environmental impacts.
   The PUC directed its commission advisory compliance division within 100
days to issue a notice of preparation of an EIR and retain the services of
an environmental consultant to be approved by the commission. The
consultant will work with the commission to prepare an EIR that will
analyze the environmental impacts of electric restructuring, compare
environmental effects of alternative policies and identify mitigation
measures for potential significant impacts.
   Given the broad restructuring policy, the EIR will contain a more
general discussion of impacts, alternatives and migitations than a
traditional site-specific environmental assessment, the PUC noted. Hence,
it will attempt to anticipate future scenarios that may develop under the
commission's restructuring policy.
   Moreover, the EIR may incorporate or refer to the environmental impact
statement the the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is preparing under
the National Environmental Policy Act for its mega-notice of proposed
rulemaking on open access, the PUC said.
   The PUC also committed itself to maintaining the state's resource
diversity and developing policies that promote development of new renewable
energy resources in a restructured electric services industry. ``We
continue to believe that a minimum renewables purchase requirement is the
best approach to meet our resource diversity goals,'' the PUC said.
   However, the commission acknowledged that it had not determined whether
the renewables requirement should be imposed on retail suppliers or
generators. Accordingly, the PUC delayed consideration of this question
until its implementation phase and called upon its working group to provide
further guidance.
   The PUC stated its preference for setting the renewables purchase
requirement at the same level for all electric utilities statewide, but it
acknowledged that a transitional strategy may be appropriate given the
utilities' current resource portfolios.
   To provide flexibility in meeting the renewables requirement, renewables
``credits'' would be tradable similar to pollution credits under the
federal Clean Air Act Amendments and the South Coast Air Quality Management
District's Regional Clean Air Incentives Market.
   The PUC set a target date of January 1998 for establishing minimum
renewables levels continuing through 2000, at which time the commission
would review the requirement for possible modification. As with the Clean
Air Act and state air quality permit programs, the PUC plans to establish a
``meaningful penalty'' for noncompliance.
   This market-based approach would eliminate the need for a surcharge to
fund renewables development by allowing buyers and sellers to secure the
best bargains on renewables and include the costs in their prices, the PUC
said.
   By contrast, establishing a surcharge to fund renewables development
would require the PUC to administer and disperse the funds to ensure
compliance. However, after its disastrous experience with the ill-fated
Biennial Resource Planning Update independent power auction, the commission
stressed that it was extremely reluctant to do so.
   ``The minimum renewables requirement approach will allow the market to
provide the most cost-effective renewable resources, without our
intervention,'' the PUC predicted. Moreover, allowing providers to trade
renewables requirements could serve to minimize stranded costs from
qualifying facility contracts by providing new markets for QFs' power, the
PUC said.
   This approach would also likely stimulate research and development of
renewables as existing renewables are replaced by new resources to meet the
increased demand for electricity, the commission predicted.
   The PUC's renewables standard is being welcomed by officials at the
American Wind Energy Association, who with the Union of Concerned
Scientists and others, helped sell the PUC on the idea.
   ``There had been an expectation of a tax on generation, with the
revenues used to support the renewables industry,'' AWEA executive director
Randall Swisher said. ``That is one way to go, but from our perspective a
standard is less bureaucratic and more market oriented.''
   Swisher said the minimum renewable capacity requirement should be placed
on sellers, not generators, so that the state--not FERC--would have
oversight authority. The standard should be set at around 11.5% of total
capacity, the current share of the California market provided by
renewables, Swisher said.
   Sellers with no renewable capacity could purchase credits from another
company that owned renewables capacity or that had excess renewable energy
credits, he said.
   With a portfolio standard, ``you just set the minimum standard and sit
back and let the market do the rest,'' Swisher said.

EPRI ANALYSIS SAYS ELECTRICAL WORKERS HAVE 10-20% MORE RISK OF BRAIN
CANCER

   A new Electric Power Research Institute study that assessed research on
workplace electromagnetic fields has found that electrical workers are
about 10% to 20% more likely to develop brain cancer than other workers.
   But because no clear relationship can be found between the amount of
exposure to EMFs and the level of risk, researchers cannot conclude that
EMFs cause brain cancer, the analysis said. The study found that ``the
apparent lack of a clear pattern of exposure and risk substantially
detracts from the hypothesis that measured magnetic fields in the work
environment are responsible for the observed excess of risk.''
   In other words, according to coauthor Dr. Patricia Buffler, who is dean
of the University of California at Berkeley, School of Public Health,
``there is something about employment in [the studied] occupations'' that
may or may not have anything to do with EMFs. She argued that the observed
association between work in electrical occupations, a broad category that
includes electricians and power plant operators, and elevated cancer risk
likely has more to do with limitations in the studies than any kind of tie
to EMF exposure.
   The study, published in the December issue of the Journal of
Occupational and Environmental Medicine, reexamined more than 50 previous
studies and pools the results of 29 of them for a new statistical analysis.
The pooled data showed a slightly elevated risk of brain tumors (10-20%)
for workers in the electrical occupations category, a result with
sufficient statistical strength to be considered reliable. Higher risks
were seen for some more specific job categories and for one subtype of
brain cancer, gliomas.
   The authors, who in addition to Buffler included Dr. Leeka Kheifets of
EPRI, and Dr. Abdelmonem Afifi and Zhong Zhang of the University of
California at Los Angeles, School of Public Health, assessed their findings
against three possible hypotheses on EMFs and cancer.
   First, they concluded that the analysis ``provides some evidence against
the hypothesis of no association between occupational exposure to EMF and
the risk of cancer.'' On the second possibility--a small but pervasive
cancer risk--they found ``some evidence to support the hypothesis.''
The third possibility is that ``the true EMF effect is large'' but only
impacts individuals who are in some way predisposed to develop cancer or
who are exposed simultaneously to another factor. On this count, the
researchers concede that their study ``provides no clues that could help to
identify a circumstance or condition'' to explain such a risk.
   Overall, the researchers found ``it is not possible to conclude that EMF
is causally associated with the observed excess of brain cancer in workers
employed in electrical occupations.''
   About one-third of the studies reviewed in the EPRI report were
conducted in the United States, another one-third in Scandinavia and the
remainder in Canada, Australia, Great Britain, Germany and other countries.
The earliest study was published in 1983, while the largest number of
studies, six, appeared in 1991.
   About half of the studies included follow-up before 1984 and were
published before 1990. Study designs used by the investigators included
proportional mortality, case control analysis of death certificate data,
case control and cohort studies.
   The U.S. and other studies showed relative risk increases of 40% or
higher compared to those with no occupational exposures to EMFs. The
Scandinavian studies, almost all of which were cohort studies based on
incident risk, showed the lowest relative risks for brain cancer. The
reasons for the lower relative risk reported in the Scandinavian studies
``are not exactly clear,'' the EPRI study said.
   A 1994 study of Canadian and French electric utility workers showed a
doubling of brain tumor risk by some measures, for example, but the result
was not statistically significant (UER, 1 April '94, 1).
   A large study of U.S. utility workers, funded by EPRI and completed
early last year, found a statistically significant increase in brain cancer
risk for those with the highest exposures (UER, 20 Jan '95, 1).

CALIFORNIA RETREATS, BUT MASS. GOV. WELD HOLDS FIRM, ON EV MANDATES

   Massachusetts Gov. William Weld (R) reaffirmed his commitment to the
state's zero-emission vehicle program, which includes a 2% electric vehicle
sales mandate beginning in 1998, despite recent action by the California
Air Resources Board to drop its own EV sales mandate that would have begun
in the same year.
   Bowing to pressure from the auto industry, CARB Dec. 21 said it will
lift the state's landmark mandate requiring auto makers to sell about
22,000 EVs in California beginning in 1998. CARB directed its staff to
finalize a plan by March 1996 to lift the mandate requiring that 2% of
vehicles sold in California have zero emissions by 1998 and 5% by 2001.
   The air board decided not to impose the mandate until 2003, at which
time 10% of vehicles sold in California will have to be exhaust-free in
order to achieve a statewide reduction of 14 tons/day of nitrous oxide and
hydrocarbons.
   In the interim, auto makers must aim to sell up to 3,700 EVs in the
smog-laden Los Angeles and Sacramento basins during the first three years
of the program--750 in 1998, 1,500 in 1999 and 1,500 in 2000. Based on auto
makers' reports, CARB estimated a statewide annual production of 5,000 EVs
in 1996 and 1997 and 14,000 in 1998.
   Massachusetts' EV plan is modeled closely on the California plan, and
that state has also faced tremendous pressure from automakers to drop its
minimum EV sales requirement.
   But Weld said Dec. 22 he thought CARB made the wrong decision to weaken
its program and noted ``that decision does not bind Massachusetts.''
Edison Electric Institute director of electric transportation Rick Tempchin
called the CARB decision ``a significant mistake,'' adding that EV
technology, consumer readiness and infrastructure are on track to launch EV
sales in California in 1998.
   ``What is missing is the political will to stand up to automakers, oil
companies and others who insist that token EV rollouts will ensure the
success of this technology,'' Tempchin said.
   CARB officials stressed that under the new plan, car makers must still
meet air pollution reduction goals through production of cleaner cars with
reduced exhaust, evaporative and refueling emissions.
   The air board adopted the zero-emission vehicle rule in 1990 to reduce
air pollution from passenger cars and light trucks. The mandate currently
applies to the seven largest auto manufacturers, with sales of more than
35,000 vehicles a year in California. By 2003, all auto makers that sell
more than 3,000 vehicles a year in the state will have to comply with the
mandate.
   The air board plans to hold a public hearing and vote on the revised
plan in March. However, CARB chairman John Dunlap said the air board had
reached consensus on lifting the mandate.
   CARB directed its staff in November to devise an alternative proposal
after the Battery Technology Assessment Panel reported auto makers'
conclusions that existing lead acid battery-powered EVs would have too
limited a sales demand to meet state pollution reduction goals (UER, 24 Nov
'95, 1).
   The air board received more than 200 comments to three staff proposals:
1) a market-based approach; 2) changing the zero-emission vehicle mandate
for early years but maintaining the rules intact for later years; and 3)
keeping the same basic format but reducing the 2% mandate for 1998.
   CARB agreed with auto makers that advanced lithium and nickel-based
battery technology for EVs--currently the only zero-emission vehicle--will
not be commercially viable until 2001. The auto industry contends that
existing lead-acid batteries have limited range and are too costly, making
them unattractive to consumers.
   Forcing manufacturers to introduce unaffordable vehicles that are
technologically unreliable would poison the fledgling EV market, CARB said.
``If you see them sitting in storerooms and no one buys them it sends a
negative message,'' said a CARB spokesman. ``No one wants to poison the
market.''
   In the interim, automakers will be allowed to build only the number of
zero-emission vehicles they think they can sell, which manufacturers
estimate at 2,000 to 3,000 in 1996 and 1997 and 14,000 a year after that,
Martin said. The 2% mandate would have amounted to about 22,000 EVs.
   Auto makers will be required to sign a memorandum of agreement
committing to a ``Cal/Big 7 Technology Development Partnership,'' to
continue research and development of advanced batteries and EVs.
Manufacturers would be given a market incentive for early production of
exhaust-free and longer-range vehicles through 2003. The state of
California would purchase some EVs each year.
   The revised mandate will not relieve auto makers from meeting their air
pollution reduction requirements based on their percentage of total vehicle
sales in California. However, CARB gave each vehicle manufacturer
flexibility to design their own individual plan for meeting their emission
reduction requirements.
   CARB directed its staff to prepare a proposal by March for meeting
statewide pollution reduction goals in lieu of the zero-emission vehicle
mandate. ``There will be absolutely no loss of pollution reduction,''
Martin stressed. ``They will individually be held accountable for them.''

THE CLOSE OF 1995 SIGNALS BEARISH SENTIMENT IN MARKET IS CONTINUING

   The sulfur dioxide emission allowance market ended the year with its
steepest monthly decline of the year, as prices nosedived in December,
oddly enough, due to the presence of a buyer.
   Bidding in a request for proposal from Illinois Power seeking 15,000
1995 allowances for immediate delivery was ``very aggressive,'' said Lynda
Clemmons of Enron Capital and Trade Resources. IP passed up prices that
``would have been leapt on'' three weeks earlier, said Carlton Bartels, a
director at Cantor Fitzgerald Environmental Brokerage Services. The winning
bidder, which was named Dec. 18, 1995, was thought to have offered prices
in the range of $105-110/ton.
   As a result, the Utility Environment Report SO2 Allowance Market Prices
have dropped to $105-$107/ton for Phase One and $100-102 for Phase Two (see
box, page 3). This is well below end-of-November prices of $119-121 for
Phase One and $118-120 for Phase Two.
   One observer noted that, with more than 3 million allowances out there,
an enormous supply was ``chasing Illinois Power's demand for 15,000.''
   Opinions varied, however, on the relative importance of an RFP the size
of Illinois Power's. One player argued that trades of 15,000 are ``not all
that large'' anymore. Another countered that a straight-out purchase of
that amount for the end of the year is still a ``pretty big deal.''
   There were few factors that could explain the increased market activity
that has been seen in recent weeks. The end of the year was having, at
most, a psychological effect, some said. There was no indication that
utilities had decided that they needed additional allowances for 1995
compliance.
   The most common explanation was that buyers are being motivated by
prices that are now ``just too good to pass up,'' and sellers may be
worrying that prices will continue to fall. One player suggested that
sellers were already anticipating a negative impact on prices from the
EPA's next auction in March.
   Cantor Fitzgerald's market price index for Phase One allowances was
$108.87 at the end of December 1995, down from $116.89 a month earlier.
Similarly, Emissions Exchange of Denver moved its value for 1995 allowances
to $105 and for 2000 allowance to $100, also a sharp drop from November
1995.
   Attention now is focused on how much lower prices will go. The market is
``pretty close to the bottom,'' Bartels argues. ``We are getting more
feedback from people who are saying that this is ridiculous, that they're
not going to sell at that price.''
   While some pessimistic studies in the past have shown that allowances
were worth less than they were trading for, Bartels noted that no reliable
study has put their value below current prices.
   Others see no evidence of the slide ending, however. ``Every seller who
has waited has done worse,'' said one player who declined to be named. The
$100 mark is a weak psychological barrier that ``is not going to stop the
downward trend,'' he said, and the barrier will likely be breached whenever
the next significant buyer comes along.
   ``It is not clear what would provide support to the market at this
point,'' said Bill Babcock, a consultant with Putnam, Hayes & Bartlett in
Cambridge, Mass. The marginal cost of producing these allowances is near
zero, he said, and demand for allowances for near-term use is almost
nonexistent.
   The partial government shutdown, meanwhile, was drawing complaints from
traders. With the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency essentially closed,
allowance transactions were not being processed. Contracts can still be
signed, one trader noted, but deals cannot be completed. The greater
uncertainty will come if the impasse drags on closer to the true-up
deadline at the end of January.

KEY TEXAS REP. SIDES WITH GAS INDUSTRY, CALLS FOR FUEL-NEUTRAL NSPS FOR
NOX

   Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas) lined up on the side of natural gas in that
industry's escalating battle with the coal industry over a proposal by the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to establish a fuel-neutral new source
performance standard (NSPS) for nitrogen oxide emissions.
   EPA is pondering a 0.15 lb./million Btu standard for NOx, a standard
that gas-fired power plants could achieve with relative ease but that many
coal-fired units would be hard-pressed to meet.
   The coal industry has argued for a standard based on fuel types, which
the industry said would allow coal to be competitive with gas.
   But in a Dec. 21, 1995 letter to his congressional colleagues, Barton
called EPA's proposed standard ``welcome news and sound and equitable
approach'' to preventing additional NOx pollution from new sources.
   ``Single standards would treat all fuels and technologies equally,''
said Barton, who chairs the House Commerce Committee's oversight and
investigations subcommittee. ``It will focus future industrial and utility
output in an efficient and competitive manner while minimizing the impact
on our nation's environment..''
   Last year, Barton hosted a number of hearings on Clean Air Act issues
and is heading a group of House Republicans expected to introduce
amendments to the air statute sometime this spring.
   Barton said a fuel-neutral standard ``will enable all combinations of
fuel (coal, oil, and natural gas) and technologies to effectively compete
for new markets. Although reliable technology exists today, this
competition will spur the development of more efficient domestic
technologies that will allow operators to meet this standard even more cost
effectively in the future.''
Barton stressed that EPA should make the new standard apply only to future
plants and not to existing facilities.
   ``While we support the fuel-neutral standard, we strongly urge the
agency to apply the standard prospectively only,'' he said. ``This `new'
standard should not apply to existing equipment. The shift to competitive
fuel-neutral standards should not penalize anyone, only invigorate
competition among suppliers for new boiler markets.''
   If a full fledged battle breaks out over the issue, Barton will find
himself pitted against coal industry allies in the Wyoming and West
Virginia delegations, to name a few, who will try to pressure EPA to base
the new NSPS standard for NOx on fuel types.
   Barton urged EPA to consider only relevant information, and not
politics, in determining the form of the new standard.
   ``[W]e encourage the agency to determine an appropriate numerical
standard based on a thorough consideration of all available and relevant
information,'' Barton said. ``The Clean Air Act amendments define the
agency's responsibility on this matter, and we trust the agency to
promulgate a standard that meets those requirements.''
   The new standard, required under a court-ordered schedule, is not
expected to be issued in draft form before September. A final rule is due
by November 1997.

SIERRA CLUB SEEKS INJUNCTION TO ORDER PS COLORADO TO CUT HAYDEN EMISSIONS

   The Sierra Club has petitioned the U.S. District Court at Denver to move
more expeditiously in assessing penalties against three utilities for
alleged air pollution standards violations at the 446-MW Hayden Generating
Station in northwest Colorado (UER, 18 Aug '95, 4).
   The group asked the court, pending determination of a final ruling, to
issue an injunction against the companies to stop ``excessive and illegal''
emissions at the plant operated by Public Service of Colorado. PacifiCorp
and Salt River Project also own interests in the Hayden facility.
   Judge Lewis Babcock found last August, in response to a Sierra Club
complaint, that the plant had exceeded Clean Air Act emission standards
more than 19,000 times in the past five years. The utilities are liable for
a total of $493-million in fines. However, the court asked the parties to
negotiate a settlement to correct the excessive emissions.
   In its latest filing in the case (No. CV-93-1749), the Sierra Club said
negotiations with PS Colorado have broken down, and it requested the court
to issue an injunction within 60 days ordering the company to take
corrective action at once.

B&W ACQUIRES JOY ENVIRONMENTAL TO BOOST POLLUTION CONTROL WORK

   Babcock & Wilcox Power Generation has acquired the assets of Joy
Environmental Technologies (JET) from its parent company, Harnischfeger
Industries, for an undisclosed amount. B&W, based in Barberton, Ohio,
expects the acquisition to expand its pollution control work in the power
industry.
   JET, with offices in Houston and Malvern, Pa., specializes in
environmental technologies used in the utility industry. Product lines that
B&W Power Generation will acquire from JET include acid mist precipitators,
electrostatic precipitators, dry flue-gas desulfurization systems and
baghouses. In addition, Diamond Power Specialty, another B&W subsidiary in
Lancaster, Ohio, will obtain JET's ash handling system business.
   B&W, which is a unit of McDermott International, already markets
environmental controls, along with steam generation equipment and
engineering/construction services. The company also has a 50% stake in four
independent power projects that produce 160 MW and is building projects in
China and Pakistan.

CALIF. AIR DISTRICTS APPROVE PG&E NOX PLANS FOR DROPPING SCR REQUIREMENTS

   Pacific Gas and Electric expects to save $150-million after negotiating
new rules with three California air quality districts that provide low
cost, short-term solutions for reducing nitrogen oxide emissions at six
power plants.
   The company said by combining its NOx retrofit program with PG&E's
regular maintenance outages, the final NOx rules provide a ``more workable
compliance schedule through 2004.''
   At issue, PG&E said, were local and state rules that ``effectively
mandated the use of costly selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technology
to achieve NOx emissions of 10 parts per million. By using front-end,
low-NOx combustion systems (LNCs) the company can reduce emissions,
previously ranging from 150 ppm to 300 ppm, to as low as 20 ppm to 30 ppm,
while future improvements in technology could lower the figure even
more.''
   The new rules apply to the Morro Bay plant in the San Luis Obispo Air
Pollution Control District; the Moss Landing plant in the Monterey Bay
Unified Air Pollution District; and the Contra Costa, Hunters Point,
Pittsburg and Potrero plants in the Bay Area Air Quality Management
District.
   Bev Alexander, an environmental attorney who serves as NOx strategy
project manager for PG&E, said, ``This was a win-win situation because PG&E
was able to propose additional amendments that would use pollution
prevention technology to achieve strict air-quality standards with greater
business flexibility and at a lower cost.''
   PG&E's NOx team began working in 1994 with state regulators on rules
originally scheduled to require significant NOx reductions by 1997. They
would have forced the company to either retrofit or retire most of its
fossil-fueled units by that year.
   SCR is a back-end method that cleans up NOx after it has formed, using a
chemical reaction involving ammonia. Use of the system requires
transporting ammonia to power plants, storing it on-site and emitting some
into the atmosphere. The system also requires construction of costly
facilities to house the heavy equipment involved.
   LNC is a front-end pollution control that reduces NOx formation by
precise flame control within the boiler. Ammonia is not required. The
company said for one of PG&E's generating units in the Bay Area Air Quality
Management District, the cost of retrofitting the boiler would be
$5-million to $12-million for LNC compared with $20-million for SCR.
   The amendments adopted by the three air districts cover all of PG&E's
power plants except the Humboldt Bay plant, which is in a district that
already meets air quality standards.
   The successful installation of LNC at the Morro Bay plant was a major
reason why the local air districts approved of PG&E's proposal. Emission
figures from the Morro Bay facility influenced the district boards in their
favorable decisions, the company said.

PA. UTILITIES APPLAUD DEP MOVE TO MAKE STATE'S RULES NO STRICTER THAN
EPA'S

   Electric utilities in Pennsylvania are enthusiastically backing an
effort by the state Dept. of Environmental Protection (DEP) to streamline
regulations and ensure that they are no more stringent than federal
standards.
   DEP began the ``Regulatory Basics'' initiative in August at the
direction of DEP secretary James Seif, who said he wanted to overhaul
regulations that exceeded federal standards, as well as those that imposed
disproportionate economic costs, lacked clarity or were redundant or no
longer necessary.
   The department asked for comments to be filed toward the end of 1995,
and investor-owned utilities filed jointly through the Pennsylvania
Electric Association (PEA). The initiative is undocketed and no public
hearings are planned, though hearings might be scheduled later, a DEP
spokesman said.
   In its comments, PEA applauded Seif for ``attempting to minimize costs
on the regulated community, encourage performance-based outcomes and to
create a level playing field for Pennsylvania businesses.''
   The utilities complained that DEP has relied on a ``belts and
suspenders'' approach to environmental regulation, or using multiple
assumptions about environmental impacts. ``While this certainly ensures
that the goal of environmental protection is met, the regulated community
has incurred tremendous costs, often with little or no attendant
environmental benefit,'' PEA said. Aside from affecting the utilities, this
approach has helped drive out industrial firms and repelled new investment
in manufacturing.
   Specifically, PEA criticized DEP's water quality-based effluent
limitations as being based on a ``steady state'' model that assumes
worst-case scenarios and is far too restrictive. The group noted that each
condition measured in the model has a low probability of occurrence, while
the combination of conditions would rarely or never occur. PEA prefers
``dynamic'' models, which account for variations of flow, effluent and
environmental conditions, and which determine the actual probability that a
water quality exceedance will occur.
   PEA also complained that DEP applies human health criteria at the point
of discharge, instead of at the point of withdrawal for drinking water
supplies. This exceeds the requirements of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, as well as Pennsylvania's own written regulations, it
pointed out. PEA also contended that DEP applies aquatic life standards
when there are no substantial populations in streams.
   Regarding air pollution issues, PEA said that the state DEP uses a
broader definition of pollutants than EPA for requiring Title 5 permits
under the Clean Air Act. The state also does not follow federal standards
relating to permit revisions and flexibility, and does not allow an
``emergency defense'' for unforeseeable events. The utilities also think
the $37/ton permitting fee may be higher than necessary to fund DEP
programs, and they would eliminate the $14/ton fee for actual emissions
because it violates the federal Clean Air Act.
   The department also forbids the use of emission reduction credits (ERCs)
for compliance with nitrogen oxide ``Reasonably Available Control
Technology'' (RACT) standards, despite EPA efforts to develop emissions
trading, the group said. They also fear that ERCs generated from
over-compliance will not be applicable to future reduction requirements for
NOx.
   While utilities agree heartily with the direction of the Regulatory
Basics proceeding, the Sierra Club condemned the move to roll back DEP
standards to the federal level. Jeff Schmidt, government liaison in the
Harrisburg, Pa. office, told Utility Environment Report, ``The minimum
federal standards are just that--minimums. They are meant to provide a
safety net, but states should be able to design more protective standards
based on specific regional and climactic conditions. Federal standards are
a floor below which you should not go, but the administration seems to want
to make them a ceiling.''
   Schmidt also criticized Seif for developing many of the changes among
his staff, without allowing public access to records. He estimated that the
changes could take 18 months, and ``the cumbersome regulatory process
usually rewards economic interests.''

CALIF. COURT THROWS OUT SUIT CLAIMING SOCAL ED EQUIPMENT EMFS CAUSED
CANCER

   A California Superior Court judge has dismissed a lawsuit against
Southern California Edison brought by three people with cancer who claim
that strong electromagnetic fields from the utility's equipment caused
their diseases.
   In an order last month, Judge Warren Siegel wrote that summary judgment
must be granted in favor of the defendants because the plaintiffs ``cannot
show causation by any generally accepted scientific principle in the
medical community.''
   The only witnesses that the plaintiffs offered to address the question
of what caused the cancers, according to the order, were experts on
statistical studies of EMFs and cancer. The judge found that they were not
qualified to address the medical issue of whether the particular
individuals' cancers were caused by EMFs.
   The judge wrote that the plaintiffs were, therefore, ``relying on
statistical analysis to express a medical opinion that EMF may cause
certain types of cancer.'' This, he ruled, was insufficient to allow the
case to go to trial.
   The plaintiffs intend to file a motion with Siegel requesting a new
trial, according to their attorney, Annee Della Donna of the Wylie A.
Aitken law firm. The decision to dismiss was ``unbelievably erroneous,''
Della Donna said. The judge ruled on the sufficiency of the causation
witnesses, Della Donna argued, when he was supposed to be ruling on the
admissibility of the witnesses under various evidentiary rules governing
scientific testimony.
   If the request for a new trial is rejected, she said, the plaintiffs
will seek a writ from the appeals court. ``This is a clear violation of our
due process rights'' she added, since the judge ruled on something without
giving proper notice that the issue was up for consideration.
   John Tinker, senior counsel with SoCal Ed, countered that ``the judge
has recognized that there is no sound scientific evidence to bring this
before a jury.'' He added, ``The company and the industry are very pleased
with this result.''
   The three plaintiffs with cancer in this case all worked in a real
estate office on the ground floor of a 14-story office building in Orange
County, Calif. The office had unusually strong EMFs because it is directly
above a vault containing transformers, switching gear and distribution
circuits for the building. The building owners and the real estate company
are named as defendants in the case in addition to SoCal Ed (Johsz et al.
vs Koll Company et al., Case No. 726765).
   Two other individuals with cancer who also worked in the office have a
similar lawsuit pending against the same defendants. It is before a
different judge and was not directly affected by the dismissal of this
case.
   Della Donna, who is handling the second case as well, has said that the
excess incidence of disease among workers in the real estate office
constitutes a cancer cluster.

TVA'S FINAL IRP INCREASES COMMITMENT TO RENEWABLES, ENERGY CONSERVATION

   The Tennessee Valley Authority said it has increased its commitment to
renewables and energy conservation in a final version of its integrated
resource plan made public in late December.
   TVA said the changes were made in part as a response to comments from
conservation and environmental groups, which had called on the federally
owned utility to adopt more aggressive policies in these areas.
   Among the short-term actions in the final plan, TVA said it would
intensify research into the use of wind energy and carry out at least one
wind project in its service area during the next two years.
   At the same time, TVA will begin tests this year of co-firing of biomass
waste products at its large coal-fired plants and then in 1997 move ahead
with the first commercial biomass co-firing project.
   In a third effort, TVA will step up reviews of ways to increase use of
coalbed methane and landfill methane to produce power in the region. TVA
hopes to sponsor an initial test of a fuel cell-landfill methane system.
   On energy efficiency programs, TVA said it is now committed to add 650
MW of demand-side resources by 2002 and as much as 2,200 MW by 2010. It
said this was an increase of 750 MW over previous versions of the plan.
   Also as part of the IRP, TVA detailed a longer term research plan for
renewables and conservation that will cover the use of photovoltaics for
service to remote areas and for cutting residential energy costs, electric
vehicle infrastructure development and use of communication techniques for
energy load management.
   Because TVA took an approach in its IRP that uses a portfolio of
options, the plan contained no set estimate of environmental impacts,
especially over the long term. But TVA said the need to comply with federal
and state regulations would create a ``safety net'' effect against
increased environmental impacts as different options were implemented.
   Outside groups will make one final round of comments on the TVA plan in
mid-January, after which it will be approved in final form by the TVA board
in February.
   TVA has moved ahead in the last two months to start up two nuclear
reactors at its Watts Bar and Browns Ferry sites, over strong protests from
the environmental community. It remains to be seen whether improvements in
the IRP will bridge the differences over nuclear policy.

MISSOURI IOUS, STATE UNIVERSITY CREATE ENERGY COLLABORATIVE FOR RENEWABLES

   Missouri's investor-owned utilities and the University of
Missouri-Columbia, College of Engineering have formed the Missouri Electric
Utility Renewables Group (MEURG), an organization dedicated to identifying,
gathering information, researching and testing the feasibility of renewable
generation opportunities in the state.
   Participating utilities include Empire District Electric, Kansas City
Power & Light, St. Joseph Light & Power, Union Electric and UtiliCorp
United.
   The group will give member utilities a forum to discuss integration of
renewable energy into the state's electric power generation mix.
Technologies will include wind, clean biomass, photovoltaic, solar thermal
and low-head hydroelectric.
   MEURG will evaluate the potential benefits of renewable energy to
utilities and their customers and communicate renewable energy information
to the public. The university may also coordinate workshops, symposia and
seminars and seek federal and private funding for renewable energy
research.
   James Thompson, dean of the College of Engineering, said, ``We are
pleased to participate in this important initiative to explore renewable
energy resources for the state of Missouri. This collaborative effort has
strong potential to benefit the environment and conserve energy resources
by providing an efficient means for exploring renewable energy
resources.''
   Gary Huber, UE's representative in the group, said the university's
involvement offers research advantages. ``It also offers a vehicle for
leveraging research dollars and reducing costs associated with developing
renewable energy projects,'' he said.

IP&L EYEING LANDFILL METHANE-FIRED PROJECT IN INDIANAPOLIS THIS YEAR

   Indianapolis Power & Light could give final approval this month for a
renewable energy project in which an internal combustion engine fired with
methane gas from a landfill would generate 3.5 MW of electricity.
   Dan Melvin, IP&L principal engineer in systems planning, said the
project is in the utility's budget for 1996. If final approval comes this
month, the project is expected to be in operation later in the year. Melvin
told Utility Environment Report., ``We looked at using used equipment. We
are now evaluating proposals from vendors.''
   IP&L included the landfill gas project as part of its ``short-term
action plan'' in an integrated resource plan it recently filed with the
Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.
   In the IRP, the utility said the purpose of the project is to ``utilize
the favorable economics and environmental benefits that are sometimes
available with renewable energy systems.''
   The project would be located at the Southside landfill in Indianapolis.
The current landfill operator already burns some methane to heat a
greenhouse on the site. Under Indiana law, all landfills that accept leaves
and yard waste for disposal must be equipped with methane burners.
   Melvin estimated there is enough methane at the Southside landfill to
last for 10 to 15 years.
   The Southside landfill could set the stage for similar type projects by
IP&L. Melvin said IP&L is negotiating with Allison Engines, one of its
customers, to purchase an 11-MW gas turbine that could be installed at a
site by the late 1990s.

STATE ENVIRONMENTAL OFFICIALS BACK ELEMENTS OF NHA RELICENSING PROPOSAL

   A national organization of state environmental officials said they
support key elements of a proposal by the National Hydropower Association
to revamp the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's project relicensing
procedures, but said the NHA plan needs ``more explicit accommodations for
settlement provisions.''
   The Environmental Council of the States (ECOS), a national, non-profit
organization composed of environmental officials from 50 of the 55 U.S.
states, territories and the District of Columbia, praised the NHA proposal,
filed with FERC in September 1995.
   FERC in October called for comment on the proposal (Docket No. RM-16),
indicating it planned to undertake a rulemaking on relicensing issues. NHA
last month said a formal negotiated rulemaking would allow for timely
reform of the commission's relicensing procedures.
   ECOS praised the NHA proposal's emphasis on reducing the overall time
for reviewing FERC license applications, eliminating redundant reports and
involving all stakeholders at the earliest time possible in the
environmental review process.
   Nevertheless, ECOS said FERC should include provisions to assist states
in settling disputes among stakeholders.
   ``We strongly believe that more explicit accommodations for settlement
initiatives need to be provided by FERC beyond the encouragement given in
the NHA proposal,'' ECOS said, adding that many of its concerns likely
could be resolved by administrative reforms and would not necessarily
require additional rulemaking.
   ``Specifically, there should be provisions to ensure that formal
regulatory positions from involved agencies are not solicited by FERC on
draft [National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)] documents during ongoing
settlement negotiations,'' ECOS said. ``The outcome of negotiations can
greatly accelerate NEPA reviews. Conversely, the quest for reasonable
settlement terms could also be undermined by the continued pursuit of
formal regulatory positions that might constrain the flexibility of
participants in modifying their positions to work toward agreements.''
   FERC could include ``an escape clause'' that would allow the commission
to defer on regulatory steps during ongoing settlement negotiations, ECOS
said.
   ECOS agreed with NHA that the commission's ex parte rules on FERC
communications with participants in the licensing process are another area
in need of reform.
   ``Staff interpretations of ex parte constraints can be extreme and
result in a stifling of communications and early resolution of issues
between FERC and other agencies and participants,'' ECOS said.
   ``Other agencies of government, including our own, are sensitive to ex
parte concerns and yet are able to find ways to do business without
incurring these problems. Any reform proposal for hydropower licensing must
deal with this issue.''
   ECOS questioned the NHA provision that strongly encourages FERC to enter
into a memorandum of understanding with other agencies to coordinate input
on relicensing proceedings, saying that NHA makes no clear statement on why
such an MOU is necessary.
   Alternatively, ECOS suggested that regulations could mandate the
consolidation of federal agency input into hydropower relicensing in a
coordinated time frame.
   In addition, ECOS said the proposal would benefit from ``specific
provisions that facilitate comprehensive river basin planning by providing
financial and/or technical support.''
   ``Such planning is critical to providing a clear and reasonable context
to any cumulative impact assessment in river basins,'' ECOS continued. ``It
is essential to provide a vision of what agencies and the public want in a
river basin and not just the more traditional regulatory view of what they
don't want. This should be extremely valuable to power producers seeking to
secure their future in a given basin.''

WIS. UTILITIES OPPOSING BILL REQUIRING FREE SPARK GAS ISOLATORS FOR
FARMERS

   Wisconsin utilities are opposing a move by a state legislator to require
electric companies to provide spark gap isolators for farm customers who
raise livestock and believe they are experiencing stray voltage problems.
   Rep. Don Hasenohrl recently introduced Assembly Bill 725 that mandates
utilities to install spark gap isolators at no charge if a livestock farmer
hires an electrician who certifies that the farm electric system is wired
so that installation will not create ``a significant safety hazard'' to
persons, livestock or property at the site.
   The bill further provides that if the farmer requests it, the electric
utility must use spark gap isolators with a minimum breakdown voltage of
1,000 volts. A customer may bring action in any court to compel compliance
with these provisions, the bill reads.
   Isolation occurs when the physical connection is broken between the
neutral conductor of the utility system and the neutral conductor of the
farm's electrical system. The National Electric Safety Code states that if
this connection is broken, a device must be installed that reconnects the
conductors at low resistance to enhance safety if a fault occurs or
lightening strikes either the farm or utility system.
   According to Chuck DeNardo, senior engineer at Wisconsin Electric,
utilities oppose A.B. 725 on two major counts. First, it allows the
customer to initiate the decision to break the neutral connection without
evidence that the utility is contributing to the stray voltage problem and
without an understanding of what isolation means.
   Second, the bill eliminates use of lower-voltage reconnection devices
now used by utilities and replaces them with higher-voltage spark gap
isolators. DeNardo explains that the lower the reconnection voltage, the
safer the device. The ``electronic switching'' devices currently used by
utilities have reconnection voltages of about 25 volts, while the bill can
require spark gap isolators with minimum reconnection voltages of 1,000
volts.
   A spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Utilities Association said utilities in
the state have very serious concerns about the use of spark gap isolators
and will be opposing the proposed legislation. A.B. 725 was originally
referred to the Assembly Committee on Agriculture, but an effort is now
under way to have it transferred to the Committee on Environment and
Utilities, whose members are believed to have ``a greater appreciation for
the safety considerations involved,'' the association said.

TUCSON ELECTRIC, NEW WORLD POWER JOINT IMPLEMENTATION PROJECTS CHOSEN

   Projects developed by Tucson Electric and New World Power to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries were among eight projects
selected to join the U.S. Initiative on Joint Implementation (USIJI), a
pilot program aimed at finding cost-effective ways to cut emissions and
promote sustainable development.
   Joint implementation, in which companies from developed nations team
with partners in developing countries to reduce emissions, is seen as a key
weapon in the Clinton administration's program for reducing U.S. emissions.
While participating companies may not now claim credit against future
requirements for emission reductions achieved overseas, U.S. treaty
negotiators hope to include amendments that will allow credit for such
projects.
   The eight projects, announced Dec. 19, 1995 in Washington by
undersecretary of state for global affairs Tim Wirth, represent private
sector investments that could top $200-million when the projects are fully
implemented.
   They were selected after a technical review and evaluation of how they
conformed with U.S. joint implementation guidelines by a panel of senior
officials from the Dept. of Energy, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
and six other federal agencies.
   This is the second round of projects to be included in the USIJI
program, which began in October 1993 as part of President Clinton's climate
change action plan. A first round of projects, representing more than
$40-million in private investment, was selected in February 1995 (UER, 17
Feb '95, 10).
   New World Power and its two Costa Rican partners will build a 16-MW
hydropower plant using the Puerto Viejo River and Quebradon Creek in
northern Costa Rica. The project will displace thermal units that burn
high-sulfur diesel fuels, bunker fuels and other fossil fuels.
   New World Power will participate in a second project, also in Costa
Rica, to develop a 20-MW wind power plant. The project will displace
fossil-fuel fired generation, and power will be sold to the Costa Rican
Institute of Electricity.
   Nations Energy, a subsidiary of Tucson Electric, will participate in a
project to develop a 10- to 15-MW biomass plant in Guaimaca, Honduras.
Sawmill and logging residues, currently burned in an uncontrolled manner
and left to decompose on the forest floor, will serve as the fuel source,
making the use of trees for fuel unnecessary and not cost-effective.
   The International Utility Partnership, an industrywide initiative, also
will participate in the Honduras project, whose power will be sold to the
Empresa Nacional de Energia Electrica, the Honduran national utility.
   The other projects selected are a carbon sequestration project in Costa
Rica, a geothermal plant in Nicaragua, a second wind plant in Costa Rica, a
forestry management project in Costa Rica, and a project to capture
fugitive methane emissions in Russia.

CANADA DECIDES TO CONTINUE VOLUNTARY GREENHOUSE GAS PROGRAM UNTIL NOV. '96

   Canadian officials have decided to continue using a voluntary program to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, despite a recent plea from the federal
Dept. of the Environment for more aggressive measures to ensure that Canada
stabilizes emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000.
   Canada's greenhouse gas program, called the Climate Change Voluntary
Challenge and Registry (VCR),was launched in 1994 by the federal and
provincial governments and is operated by Natural Resources Canada.
   Resistance to mandatory emission reduction measures is headed by the
province of Alberta, the heart of Canada's fossil-fuel industry, which
emits 30% of Canada's greenhouse gases. The three major utilities in
Alberta strongly favor voluntary approaches over traditional regulatory
plans.
   At a meeting late last year of Canada's federal and provincial
environment and energy ministers in Edmonton, Alberta, officials decided to
continue Canada's reliance on the VCR until November 1996, when ministers
will reassess the greenhouse gas emission picture. This is even though the
federal National Action Program forecasts that emissions will increase 13%
by year 2000 under the VCR.
   At the meeting, federal environment minister Sheila Copps argued that
``without a stronger plan from provinces like Alberta, we're not going to
be there. Alberta's plan is not going to work.''
   But Ty Lund, Alberta's minister of environmental protection, argued that
Alberta was the first province to register a plan with the VCR, and that
firms responsible for 70% of Alberta's greenhouse gases have either joined
the VCR or declared their intent to enroll.
   Alberta energy minister Anne McLellan added that the VCR is rapidly
gaining industry support, including from the Canadian Electrical
Association and the trade associations of the petroleum, natural gas and
coal industries. Initial responses to the VCR have been ``very
encouraging,'' she said, noting that over 475 companies and institutions
have expressed a commitment to participate.
   In the absence of any mandatory control program, Canada's greenhouse gas
emissions have increased by 4.9% from 577 million metric tons in 1990 to
605 million metric tons in 1994. The largest increases were in Saskatchewan
(24%) and Alberta (15%).
   The coal-fired plants of TransAlta Utilities, Alberta Power and Edmonton
Power account for 35% of the provincial emission total. TransAlta, Canada's
largest investor-owned utility with 3,676 MW of coal-fired capacity,
announced a plan last year to cut greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by 2000.
The plan is considered the most advanced in Canada.
   Gordon Lambert, TransAlta's director of sustainable development,
acknowledged that achieving the stabilization goal will be challenging for
TransAlta Corp., the owner of TransAlta and TransAlta Energy. This is
because greenhouse gas emissions from TransAlta Corp.'s Canadian
operations, which include two natural gas-fired, combined-cycle
cogeneration plants in Ontario, are forecasted to increase up to 15% over
1990 levels by 2000 to meet growing customer demand.
   TransAlta Corp. expects to achieve its stabilization target from
renewable energy purchases (13%), customer efficiencies (16%), internal
efficiencies (32%) and domestic and international offsets (41%).
   But Robert Hornung, climate change director of the Alberta-based Pembina
Institute for Appropriate Development, claimed that TransAlta is buying
renewable energy only because such purchases are required under Alberta's
Small Power Research and Development Act. Customer demand-side management
programs are behind schedule and are being scaled back. The agricultural
offsets planned by TransAlta in Saskatchewan are ``not credible,'' added
Hornung.
   The utility's Saskatchewan Soil Enhancement Project involves a
soil-tilling technique using ``low-disturbance direct seeding'' to increase
the carbon dioxide storage capacity of the soil. TransAlta claims the
project can offset up to 1.1 million metric tons of CO2.
   However, Hornung argued that the same logic should apply to TransAlta's
extensive coal mining operations and wetland drainage, which release
greenhouse gases to the atmosphere but are not included in the utility's
greenhouse gas inventory. Moreover, no nation has yet quantified the
changes in soil carbon content arising from human activities.
   TransAlta also is looking for a 13% contribution from international
offsets, which Canada cannot count toward meeting its commitment to
stabilize greenhouse gases, Hornung said. International offsets before the
year 2000 are not credited under the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change.
   In general, Hornung said the VCR is flawed because governments have not
implemented supportive regulatory and fiscal policies.
   Nonetheless, Lambert said that by submitting an action plan, TransAlta
Corp. is making a ``visible commitment to Canada's international obligation
to address greenhouse gases.''
   The Pembina Institute examined 189 VCR submissions by corporations and
governments and reviewed 73 action plans. The review determined that 80% of
companies failed to provide the basic information needed to assess the
credibility of their plans; 37% did not provide a greenhouse gas inventory;
and 72% did not project emission levels by 2000.
   Saskatchewan Power, also a coal-based utility, emits 35% of the
province's total greenhouse emissions. SaskPower's system has 1,997 MW of
coal-fired capacity, but Saskatchewan has not yet developed a CO2
stabilization plan.

TVA PCB WASTE EXCHANGE

   The Tennessee Valley Authority said it was able to save $20,000 in
disposal fees for polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) wastes under an innovative
exchange agreement with the Dept. of Energy's Oak Ridge weapons plant.
   Under the deal, TVA transferred 75,000 gallons of oil with slight PCB
contamination to Oak Ridge's K-25 plant site where it will be used to rinse
three 22,500 gallon tanks that had previously contained PCB wastes and are
now being decontaminated.
   Since the PCB level in the TVA oil is much lower than what had been in
the tanks, flushing with the TVA oil will be a useful initial step in the
decontamination process.
   According to Oak Ridge officials, without the oil from TVA they would
have had to spend up to $80,000 for new oil that would end up becoming
contaminated.
   Oak Ridge has a toxic waste incinerator at the K-25 site that is
licensed to destroy PCBs. It will eventually dispose of the TVA oil in the
facility at no extra cost to TVA or itself.

N.Y. CHANGES OFFSET RULES

   The New York Dept. of Environmental Conservation has changed two rules
affecting the use of nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compound
``offsets.''
The first change, which amends Subpart 231-2 and Part 621 of New York's
Title 6 regulations, requires applicants for permits to construct air
contamination sources, such as power plants, to identify the source of the
NOx and VOC emission offsets prior to issuance of the final permit to
construct. Previously, applicants had to supply the information at the time
the application was submitted to the department.
   The DEC also has proposed extending the deadline for reporting
reductions of NOx and VOCs. Reductions prior to Oct. 14, 1994 would have to
be reported by Oct. 14, 1996, instead of 1995, as originally planned.
Reductions after Oct. 14, 1994 would have to be reported within two years.

PSE&G BERGEN REPOWERING

   Public Service Electric & Gas expects significant emission reductions
and water benefits at its 650-MW Bergen Generating Station, which went back
into service with more efficient equipment.
   The station, built in 1959 to burn coal, was converted to oil and gas in
1970. In the $360-million repowering project, four combustion turbines were
installed, along with a waste-heat recovery boiler that uses heat from the
turbines to produce more power.
   Although the station will produce an additional 40 MW, nitrogen oxide
emissions will be reduced by 96%, or 10,000 tons/year, while carbon
monoxide will be cut by 63%, and carbon dioxide by 30%. PSE&G already is
marketing its NOx ``credits'' from this and other projects to businesses in
New Jersey and elsewhere in the region (UER, 9 June, 1).
   Along with the air benefits, PSE&G will cut water use and eliminate
thermal discharge at Bergen. The station will use treated waste water from
a county sewage treatment plant instead of water from Overpeck Creek, and
it will recycle the waste water back to the treatment plant instead of
discharging it into the Hackensack River.

VA. SCC COMPETITION PROBE

   Virginia's State Corporation Commission said that as part of its formal
investigation into electric power industry restructuring, it will examine
its environmental policies ``to determine if they are compatible with
desirable competition'' (Case No. TUE950089).
   The SCC said its probe, which could lead to a plan for expanding
competition among utilities and other power suppliers, will include ``an
analysis of whether increased competition will impact a utility's
willingness to take appropriate steps to address environmental concerns.''
Environmentalists in other states moving toward competition have expressed
concerns about the impact those changes would have on conservation efforts,
the development of renewables and the use of dirtier coal-fired plants to
generate cheap power.

EX-KAN. MUNI OFFICIAL SENTENCED

   The former superintendent of the Stafford Municipal utility in Kansas
has been sentenced to six months of home confinement and fined $3,000 in
connection with the illegal dumping of nine capacitors filled with
polychlorinated biphenyls.
   William Kirkpatrick originally was indicted on two counts by a federal
grand jury, one involving ordering the illegal disposal and a second of
failure to report it (Criminal No. 94-10094-01) (UER, 2 Sept '94, 10). The
former charge was dropped after he pleaded guilty to the latter, the U.S.
Attorney's office in Wichita said.
   The original charges carried a maximum penalty of four years in prison
and a $275,000 fine. The revised charges could have cost Kirkpatrick
$250,000 and three years in prison.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney said Kirkpatrick will be
electronically monitored during his home confinement.

USA, WESTERN SEEK TO MERGE; WOULD BE 3RD LARGEST SOLID WASTE FIRM

By:
By Alexandra Rudenko

   The boards of directors of USA Waste Services Inc. and Western Waste
Industries have approved the terms of a merger that would create the third
largest waste management firm in North America.
   Shareholders will be voting this spring and, pending required approvals,
a closing is planned by May 1, 1996.
   Officials of the two firms have been ``long-term friends,'' and held
ongoing discussions for the past 12 months. During ``due diligence'' over
the past 30 days, senior management from Dallas-based USA Waste has ended
up sleeping at the house of Western Waste Chairman Kosti Shirvanian, one
official told analysts.
   This means there are few surprises in store. The chances are slight
that something might jeopardize the negotiations as happened several years
ago when Browning Ferris Industries considered buying Western Waste and
then changed its mind, USA executives assured the investors.
   Following the merger announcement USA Waste Chairman John E. Drury,
Shirvanian and other senior management of the two firms attempted to fly to
Boston to outline their deal to the investment community. However, a
winter storm interfered and the group hurriedly rescheduled meetings for
two days in New York City. Here again the bad weather caused a cancellation
of the second day's activities as the executives rushed back home to more
temperate climates.
   The merger agreement provides that the stockholders of Western Waste
will receive 1.5 shares of USA Waste common stock for each Western Waste
common share. USA Waste has received an irrevocable proxy from Shirvanian,
who is Western Waste's largest shareholder, to vote his shares in favor of
the merger. These shares represent approximately 31% of Western Waste's
shares outstanding.
   USA Waste already owns approximately 4.5% of the Western Waste
outstanding shares, with such shares scheduled to be canceled at the
effective time of the merger.
   Based upon Western Waste's approximately 16-million shares and
equivalents outstanding and existing indebtedness, the merger would be
valued at about $525-million.
   Drury will retain his position as chairman and CEO of USA Waste, and
Shirvanian will become a vice chairman of the board of USA Waste at the
time of the merger.
   The combined companies have annualized revenues of over $800-million and
total assets in excess of $1-billion.
   After the merger, USA Waste will have 61 collection operations, 35
landfills, 24 transfer stations and five recycling operations, serving over
1-million customers in 23 states.
   Drury said, ``We expect the merger to be additive to USA Waste's
earnings per share because of cost savings and operational improvements
expected to be realized by the combination.
   ``Savings should come from combining operations and reducing
administrative and staffing cost. There is also potential to grow and
expand in and around Western Waste's existing markets in California, Texas,
Florida and in other states,'' said Drury.
   At Smith Barney, vice president Leone Young viewed the merger as
positive and upgraded the USA Waste from an ``outperform'' to a ``buy.''
It's a good strategic move. They have a very experienced and sizable
management team. At worst it will be earnings neutral,'' she said.

HOUSE GETS LEGISLATION TO CREATE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR ENVIRONMENT

By:
KH

   Rep. Jim Saxton (R-N.J.), chairman of the House Resources subcommittee
on Fisheries, Wildlife and Oceans has introduced into the House of
Representatives a bill that would create a National Institute for the
Environment (NIE).
   Similar legislation was introduced previously in 1994 in the 103rd
Congress, said an official with the Committee for the NIE, an organization
of more than 9,000 scientists, business leaders and environmentalists that
is backing creation of the NIE in its quest to improve the scientific basis
for environmental decision making.
   The institute would be an independent, non-regulatory federal entity
designed to serve as a single source of scientific information and research
on the environment, said the committee official. Its proposed budget for
its first year is $130 million, but proponents maintain that no additional
federal money will be needed because of the elimination of ``duplicative,
outdated federal programs'' that would be replaced by the NIE, the official
added.
   Although a definite timetable has not been set, Senate Minority Leader
Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) is expected to introduce the Senate version of NIE
legislation early this year, possibly in January. House hearings have also
been tentatively slated for this month before the Saxton subcommittee.
   The committee official was candid in admitting she could not confidently
predict the likelihood of passage for the NIE. However, she noted that the
NIE's ``diverse supporters'' include House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.),
who had helped sponsor the legislation in its previous incarnation.
   Saxton, meanwhile, said: ``The NIE proposal has been truly close to my
heart for over five years. ``There have been changes in the political
arena which make the atmosphere on Capitol Hill more conducive to a `smart
government' initiative such as the NIE. The NIE will make government work
better, cheaper and more efficiently with smarter regulations and sound
science. It's time to move environmental policy out of the moody political
spectrum where it is now, and get it back on science where it belongs,''
Saxton said.
   Dr. Stephen Hubbell, chair of the Committee for the NIE and a professor
of ecology at Princeton University, along with Henry Howe of the University
of Illinois, Chicago, have been credited with the creation of the NIE
effort, which began with a meeting of 50 scientists, environmentalists and
policy experts in 1989.
   ``We have environmental groups with their agendas, industry with their
agendas and regulatory agencies with their agendas, but we don't have a
credible, independent science agency where people can go and say, `What do
we really know about this problem?' '' Hubbell said.
   The House bill calls for the NIE to assess the state of knowledge on
environmental issues and competitively award peer-reviewed research grants
at academic institutions, private companies, government laboratories and
non-profit organizations, said the committee official. The NIE will
support education and training to help prepare future generations of
environmental scientists, she added. However, to maintain credible,
politically neutral science, the NIE will have no regulatory role, nor will
it operate laboratories, she stressed.
   The NIE effort does appear to have a large and broad legion of
supporters in addition to such influential legislators as Gingrich and
Daschle. These backers include such leading environmental companies as WMX
Technologies, Browning-Ferris Industries, Safety-Kleen Corp., ENVIRON Corp.
and Law Cos. Group; corporate giants such as AT&T, Apple Computer, Monsanto
Co., ITT Corp., Amoco Corp. and Chase Manhattan Bank; and environmental
groups such as the Environmental Defense Fund and the Sierra Club.
   Following are some of the programs that have been suggested for
inclusion in the NIE:
   -- Environmental Protection Agency: Stratospheric Ozone Depletion
Research; Exploratory Grants and Centers; Science to Achieve Results (STAR)
program; Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP); Ecological
Risk and Assessment-Reducing Uncertainty in Ecological Risk Assessment
program; Education, Outreach and Information.
   -- National Biological Service: Ecosystem Research; Information
Transfer.
   -- Department of Energy: Bureau of Environmental Research; Global
Change initiative.
   -- National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: Coastal Ocean
Program (COP); National Sea Grant College Program; National Undersea
Research Program; Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the
Environment (GLOBE).
   -- Redirection of money: Tennessee Valley Authority Environmental
Research Center; Clean Coal Technology initiative; Federal Construction
Projects, including the Bay City EPA facility and new EPA laboratories.

ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGIES CORP. SAYS ACQUISITION IS PENDING.

By:
KH

   The Lakewood, N.J.-based company said late last week that it had reached
an agreement in principal to acquire an unnamed privately-held firm ``that
would complement the existing operations'' of ETC.
   As Waste Business was going to press, an ETC official would say only
that the transaction was subject to a number of conditions, including
satisfactory completion of due diligence, the preparation and execution of
definitive agreements and the approval of the stockholders of both
companies.
   The unnamed acquisition target is projecting about $7 million in
revenues in 1995 and no significant indebtedness, said the ETC official. 
Its management will be incorporated into the management team of
Environmental Technologies, he added.

MFRI ACQUIRES ASSETS OF SZE, GERMAN PIPELINE LEAK DETECTION SYSTEM FIRM

   MFRI has acquired for an undisclosed amount of cash the assets of Kiel,
Germany-based SZE Spezial Electronik Hagenuk GmbH, a firm involved in the
development, marketing and servicing of pipeline leak detection systems,
said an MFRI spokesman.
   SZE, a subsidiary of Hanover, Germany-based Preussag, AG, posts annual
sales of about $3.6 million, he said.
   Why did Niles, Ill.-based MFRI buy SZE? ``MFRI has been providing
private label pipeline leak detection systems to the company for four years
and we have developed an understanding and appreciation of the growth
potential of the European market it serves,'' explained David Unger, MFRI
chairman, president and chief executive officer.
   ``We will expand the MFRI product line available to European customers
and aggressively seek to increase our market penetration. At the same
time, we will make the [SZE proprietary pipeline leak detection system]
available to our U.S. customers,'' said Unger.
   MFRI is a vertically integrated manufacturer and marketer of filter bags
under the Midwesco Filter name and specialty piping systems and electronic
leak detection and location systems marketed under the Perma-Pipe name.

OHIO EPA ISSUES DRAFT SOLID WASTE PERMIT FOR AMERICAN LANDFILL EXPANSION

By:
AR

   The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency has decided to issue a draft
solid waste permit to American Landfill for its plan to expand by
approximately 20-million cubic yards over 130 acres.
   A public information session and hearing is scheduled for January 10. 
When the expansion permit is issued the landfill will be able to accept
8,000 tons per day of waste, and have about 7.8-years of capacity,
according to the agency.
   The subsidiary of American Waste Systems began seeking permission for
this expansion in January 1991, and triggered a lengthy dispute with the
agency over environmental compliance issues. This was resolved in an
agreement announced in October 1995 covering all outstanding compliance
issues at the facility.
   According to the EPA official, the agency determined during a facility
compliance review that the operators had exceeded the maximum depth, height
and lateral limit for solid waste disposal as authorized in the landfill
permit. These violations increased the capacity of the landfill by at
least 2,424,342 cubic yards.
   Also it was observed that American was excavating and removing waste
tires from a closed portion of the landfill. These tires were placed on
other portions of the landfill and at the tire storage area for the
monofill. American failed to obtain prior agency approval or follow the
required rules for such activity, he said.
   In addition, American stored tires at the monofill and began
construction of the monofill prior to obtaining agency authorization. 
American Landfill was assessed a fine of $269,755 for environmental
violations at the landfill and tire monofill facility, he said.
   Under the permit granted by the agency to American in October 1995, the
company agreed to install an explosive gas extraction system. This system
was not required by the prior permit and will be an environmentally
beneficial project because it will extract potentially explosive gas from
the existing landfill, said a company official.
   As part of this environmental improvement, American was granted a
1,639,57 cubic yard increase in waste disposal capacity on top of the
northern portion of the facility. In addition, the permit allowed American
to relocate 625,815 cubic yards of waste from the center of the facility to
the northern portion of the landfill, said the state EPA.
   According to a statement issued by the Warren, Ohio-based firm, in order
to issue the expansion permit requested in 1991, the Ohio EPA was required
to perform a review of ALI's operating compliance under its existing
permit issued in 1985. During this review of the original application for
the 1985 permit, the Ohio EPA alleged that ALI was not authorized to
excavate soils at the landfill to the extent it had done and was not
required to install five feet of additional clay liner to the base of the
facility.
   ALI noted that the excavation and liner installation had occurred with
the full knowledge of the Ohio EPA since the issuance of the 1985 permit. 
However, on November 21, 1994, ALI received a notice from the Ohio EPA
alleging violations of its permit and related regulations. And the agency
asserted that ALI had significantly less remaining disposal capacity under
its 1985 permit than previously calculated by the firm, and very limited
capacity immediately available for waste disposal, explained the
statement.
   Additionally, ALI received a letter from the Ohio EPA alleging that its
April 1995 financial assurance deposit of $2.4-million was insufficient. 
Furthermore, the Ohio EPA said that the expansion permit could not be
issued until, among other things, ALI was operating in compliance or was on
a legally enforceable schedule that would result in compliance.
   During ensuing months, ALI provided information to the Ohio EPA in
support of its position. The subsidiary pointed out that hundreds of
inspections and compliance reviews that had previously been performed did
not allege any violation or raise any concern regarding ALI's excavation
activities. Additionally, it provided an opinion from a third-party
consultant who reviewed the 1985 permit, the application and other relevant
information.
   In mid-September, ALI recognized that the Ohio EPA would not be willing
to change its position, said the statement. It believed that if an
agreement with the Ohio EPA could not be reached, years of litigation would
ensue and at a minimum the expansion permit would not be issued until such
litigation was resolved.
   ``Although ALI continues to disagree with the Ohio EPA regarding
excavation depths and remaining capacity at the landfill, in light of the
time, costs and risks inherent in litigation and ALI's confidence in its
receipt of the expansion permit, ALI proceeded to negotiate so that the
expansion permit could be issued in an expedited manner,'' said the
statement.
   This resulted in the October agreement in which ALI agreed to comply
with the agency's interpretation of the 1985 permit and therefore has
agreed to excavate to depths consistent with such interpretation. The
agreement also provides for a schedule of compliance with respect to
financial assurance which ALI estimates to be approximately $10.9-million. 
The orders also address the management of scrap tires stored at and
received by ALI at the landfill and its tire monofill, said the statement.
   As a result of the agreement, ALI's total capacity is significantly less
than the 14,900,000 cubic yards ALI believed existed at the facility as of
the end of 1994, said the statement. Because of such reduced capacity, ALI
incurred a charge of approximately $9.2-million during the third quarter to
reflect the accrual of closure and post-closure monitoring costs based upon
the remaining capacity of the landfill.
   According to AWS's third quarter statement. the company incurred a net
loss of $5.6-million, or $0.19 per share, compared with net income of
$998,000, or $0.03 per share in the third quarter of 1994. The $9.2
million charge was recorded as $6.1-million net of tax or $0.20 per share.
   For the first nine months of 1995, the company incurred a net loss of
$5.4-million, or $0.18 per share, compared with net income of $1,049,000 or
$0.04 per share for the first nine months of 1994.
   In comparing the first nine months of 1995 with the first nine months of
1994, net operating revenues of the technical environmental services groups
decreased primarily due to a decrease in the level of environmental
engineering and remediation services performed.
   The company's disposal operations, including disposal brokerage,
recorded higher net operating revenues for the first nine months of 1995
compared with the first nine months of the prior year primarily due to a
significant increase in the disposal brokerage operations, partially offset
by lower disposal revenues resulting from a reduction in average disposal
rates and a decline in the volume of waste accepted by the company's
landfills.
   AWS, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, provides integrated waste
management and environmental services, including disposal, transportation
and transportation-related services, disposal brokerage and management
services, environmental engineering, site assessment, analytical laboratory
and remediation services to industrial, commercial, municipal and

BABCOCK & WILCOX POWER BUYS ASSETS OF JOY ENVIRO TECHNOLOGIES

By:
By Steven Lang

   Babcock & Wilcox Power Generation Group has bought, for an undisclosed
sum, the assets of air services firm Joy Environmental Technologies from
Harnischfeger Industries, a diversified international holding company, said
a spokesman. Joy has offices in Houston, Texas and Malvern, Pa. as well as
a warehouse facility in Honeybrook, Pa., he said.
   The deal expands B&W's line of environmental equipment products,
including acid mist precipitators, electrostatic precipitators and dry
flue-gas desulfurization systems and baghouses, the spokesman explained. 
These products will be transferred to B&W's Power Generation Group, which
is based in Barberton, Ohio, he said.
   The agreement also calls for responsibility for ash handling systems to
be transferred to Lancaster, Ohio-based Diamond Power Specialty Co., a
division of B&W that supplies boiler cleaning and diagnostic equipment and
services to the power generation industry.
   ``This acquisition is excellent for B&W. It diversifies our
environmental product line and improves our ability to meet the full scope
of our customers demands,'' said Walt Boomer, B&W Power Generation Group
president. ``It is a particularly good fit for Diamond Power because Joy's
ash handling business gives Diamond an additional product line. We expect
that this will expand Diamond's market potential quite dramatically.''
   ``Merging the best of Joy's technology into ours will not only increase
our reach in the environmental equipment industry, it will also help us as
we continue to develop new environmental products for the future,'' he
said.
   The Babcock & Wilcox Power Generation Group is an operating unit of
energy services company McDermott International.

EPA PICKS ECOLOGY & ENVIRO FOR UP TO $216 MILLION IN REGIONAL CONTRACTS

   Ecology and Environment, Inc. (EEI) has been awarded up to $216 million
in five multi-year regional contracts over five years to provide the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency with support for its oil and hazardous
waste spill response, removal and prevention programs, according to company
officials.
   Three of the contracts were awarded in late December and two in the
middle of last month. All five of the ``level-of-effort, cost-plus-fee''
contracts, dubbed START for Superfund Technical Assessment and Response
Teams, are effective Jan. 1, 1996 and will contribute the revenues and
earnings of EEI's current fiscal year ending July 31, 1996, said a company
official.
   In the latest announcement, EEI was selected to provide EPA with
2,532,000 technical labor hours for Regions V, VI and VII. With all
options, the combined contracts could total $158 million, said an EEI
official.
   The Chicago-based Region V contract calls for delivery of up to 1,128,00
technical labor hours and totals $68 million with all options; the
Dallas-based Region VI deal calls for delivery of up to 887,000 technical
labor hours and could total as much as $60 million; and the Kansas
City-based Region VII award could involve 517,000 hours and total $30
million with all options, said an EEI official.
   The other two regional EPA contracts that could be worth as much as $58
million to the Buffalo area, N.Y.-based firm, and involve up to 981,000
technical labor hours to support the agency's oil and hazwaste spill
programs in Regions IX and X, he said.
   The San Francisco-based Region IX contract totals $34 million with all
options, while the Seattle-based Region X contract totals $24 million with
all options. Options amount to about half of the total hours and revenue
over the five-year performance period, said the spokesman.

HI-RISE PURCHASING MAREN TO GAIN MANUFACTURER, DISTRIBUTION NETWORK

   Hi-Rise Recycling Systems, with close to 50 employees and $3.25 million
in annual sales, is acquiring Maren Engineering Corp., a company double its
size, according to Brad Hacker, Hi-Rise controller.
   Chicago-based Maren--a manufacturer, servicer and distributor of baling
and recycling equipment--posts $7.5 million in annual sales and employs 95,
Hacker said.
   Why did Miami-based Hi-Rise, which provides recycling systems for
multi-story buildings, acquire Maren? ``It's a good buy for two reasons,''
Hacker told Waste Business. ``It gives us a manufacturing facility for our
product--the hi-rise system. And it gives us a distribution network.''
   In addition, Maren is now positioned to bring its product line further
into the recycling market with Hi-Rise's background, contacts and
international distribution network, said Floyd Tuominen, Hi-Rise chief
operating officer.
   Maren's client lists includes Coca Cola-USA, Georgia Pacific, Kimberly
Clark, TRW Automotive and Dunlop Tire Corp.
   Hi-Rise anticipates closing the Maren deal during the first quarter of
1996.
   Meanwhile, the firm is looking for one additional company to acquire
this year in its plans to develop a national presence, said Hacker. If all
planned acquisitions are completed, he expects the company will record 1996
billings of about $20 million and have 135 employees.

N.Y.C. PLANS TO SEEK BIDS IN JAN. FOR BUILDER OF FRESH KILLS SLURRY WALL

By:
By Anne Magnuson

   An $80 million contract to construct 13,000 linear feet of slurry wall
at Fresh Kills Landfill, Staten Island, will be let out to bid in January
by the New York City Department of Sanitation, city officials said last
week.
   Contractors have been watching for the long-awaited request for
proposals for the slurry wall contract, which will include the installation
of leachate collection systems at the landfill's two active disposal
mounds.
   Meanwhile, a $45 million contract won by SCS Engineers, Nyack, N.Y., is
currently utilizing six million square feet of geocomposite, 10 million
square feet of HDPE, and 2 million cubic yards of fill to close 237 acres
at Fresh Kills.
   As part of these colossal projects at what is believed to be the world's
largest landfill, a gas extraction system is under installation by SCS
Engineers. Sixty-five gas wells are being imbedded on the landfill's
closed 100-foot-high mound and 108 gas wells on the closed 140-foot-high
mound, said Duane Seaman, the landfill's project manager and designer from
1992 to 1995 when he was with SCS Engineers. Seaman is now senior project
manager, Roy F. Weston of N.Y., Valhalla.
   Closure of the two active mounds, together processing 14,000 t/d of
barged N.Y.C. waste, is not expected until 2015. These mounds are
eventually to stand at 200 feet and 460 feet, the highest point on Staten
Island.
   The SCS Engineers closure project began last February and is slated for
completion in June. The magnitude of the job staggers the imagination when
considering the amount of dirt for the cap that is being hauled from New
Jersey and the city's five boroughs. Seaman said 700 trucks a day arrive,
about one per minute, carrying soil costing $6/cubic yard to $20/cubic yard
depending on its application.
   The caps, when completed, will contain smooth HDPE on the flat areas and
textured liner and geocomposite on the slopes, not to exceed 3:1. A
two-foot barrier protective layer consisting of a variety of soils will
overlay the plastic, to be topped with six inches of top soil seeded later
with cool seasonal grasses and 4 pounds/acre of wildflowers. ``Somewhere
out there are 237 acres of top soil we will have to locate,'' Seaman said.
   SCS Engineers has designed a nearly unique gas duct venting system for
the closure mounds that precludes the purchase of expensive sand. Instead
of methane migrating through a costly porous layer, the gas will travel
along interconnected trenches to gas wells and vents. ``Over 380,000 cubic
yards of sand would be a lot of sand,'' Seaman noted.
   The overall gas extraction system, eventually to collect methane from
the two closure mounds and the two active mounds, will form networks to
flow into one main for use in a manner not yet determined. Selecting a
concessionaire to complete this construction is under negotiation at DOS.

FERNALD VITRIFICATION PILOT DELAYED BY DESIGN, PROCUREMENT TROUBLES

By:
By Mary Powers

   Design and procurement problems with the vitrification plant at the
Department of Energy's former uranium enrichment facility at Fernald have
delayed its startup 17 months, but officials said it will not delay the
10-year cleanup of the entire site.
   The pressure of Superfund-imposed deadlines forced the fast-track design
and construction of the $21 million vitrification pilot plant. Pieces of
the project were designed in parallel that needed to be designed in
sequence, say DOE and FERMCO officials. ``As a result, we had to retrofit
the melter into the facility,'' said John Reising, DOE associate director
for environmental restoration.
   The decision to vitrify the radioactive materials in four cement silos
was signed last December, which started the CERCLA clock ticking. FERMCO
had 15 months to start remediation. The first glitch came when DOE had
trouble getting bids for a melter with operating temperatures of up to 1450
degrees C for the pilot plant. The RFP was revised down from a five ton/day
to a one ton/day furnace, said Nina Akgunduz, DOE's project manager. The
melter supplier is GTS Durateck Inc., Columbia, Md., with technical support
from the Vitreous State Laboratory at Catholic University in Washington,
D.C.
   The original operating schedule anticipated 100% efficiency from the
pilot plant, which could have completed test burns in three months. But the
schedule was revised after a team of specialists from Europe that operate a
similar facility there said a more realistic estimate would be 30%
efficiency. ``That adds another nine months to the test burn,'' says
Michael Skriba, FERMCO's project manager for the pilot. The pilot is
scheduled to begin operations in late February.
   Data collected from the pilot will be used to design the $200 million
full-scale vitrification plant, which will handle up to 30 tons of material
a day. Reising says one lesson learned so far is to include operations and
construction people early on in the process. ``Design problems would have
been caught earlier,'' he said.
   The design and construction of that plant is also on a fast track, with
the first construction package to be awarded in March. The early design and
construction will be limited to site preparation, water, power and other
standard engineering pieces. Parsons is the design contractor for both
vitrification plants.
   Complete vitrification of 9,700 tons of contaminated materials in the
silos will take three and a half years.
   Meanwhile, a FERMCO spokesman said work on all contaminated areas at
Fernald have shifted out of the investigation stage.
   ``It looks like 1996 will be the year for design. All key remediation
decisions were made in 1995.''

HAZ WASTE BUSINESS MONITOR

HAZ WASTE BUSINESS MONITOR

   Editor's Note:  As part of our new format, we are updating the hazwaste
business monitor table. Note that the companies and the unweighted hazwaste
average are presented just as before. However, for the hazwaste ``equal
dollar'' index we are, in effect, ``starting over'' by initially weighting
each company with $1,000 in the index. This will allow easy investment
comparison over time with the new solid waste business monitor.  Also, to
obtain a more representative basis for comparison with the general equity
markets, we have replaced the Dow Jones Industrial Average with the Russell
2000, an index of smaller companies, and the S&P 500.

SOLID WASTE BUSINESS MONITOR

                     SOLID WASTE BUSINESS MONITOR

   Editor's Note:  As part of our expanded coverage, we are launching a new
stock table to monitor the solid waste management industry. Our goal is to
provide a basis for investment comparison with the hazwaste industry and
other, broader market averages. The companies have been  selected to
represent geographical diversity and a broad range of industry segments,
including collection and disposal, recycling, waste-energy. The solid waste
unweighted average is a simple summation of the stock prices of all the
companies. The ``equal dollar'' index represents the stock market value at
any point in time from an initial investment of $1,000 in each of the
twelve companies.

PRINS RECYCLING CORP. EXPECTS RECORD LOSS IN FOURTH QUARTER.

By:
KH

   The Fort Lee, N.J. company, due to softness in the markets for
wastepaper, is projecting a record loss for the three months ended Dec. 31,
1995, said Chairman and CEO Fred Prins.
   Prins stock, which is traded on Nasdaq, slipped slightly after the
announcement on Dec. 22 (see Solid Waste Business Monitor on page 5). 
However, the firm's troubles over the year have brought the stock price
down into the $7-$8 per share range from a 52-week high of 19 3/4.
   ``While we are encouraged with our expected results for the entire 1995
fiscal year, we will sustain a loss in the fourth quarter due largely to
the precipitous decline in the markets for wastepaper during the third and
into the fourth quarter,'' said Prins. ``The fourth quarter loss cannot be
precisely quantified at this time, due in part to three evolving situations
consisting of a municipal contract and the collection of two accounts
receivable. As the fourth quarter draws to a close, however, we are seeing
a material increase in the sale price of old corrugated containers,''
historically a leading indicator of pricing trends in wastepaper, Prins
noted.
   ``We have, in fact, seen an improvement in prices for our old newspapers
recently,'' he added.

GERAGHTY & MILLER AND PARENT, HEIDEMIJ IN OVERSEAS `ACQUISITION MODE'

By:
By Steven Lang

   Geraghty & Miller and parent company Heidemij are ``in an acquisition
mode,'' according to Dee Farrell, Geraghty & Miller marketing coordinator.
   Heidemij has begun acquisition talks with Madrid-based Eptisa, ``one of
the three largest engineering companies in Spain with sales of
approximately $100 million from infrastructure, water, construction, energy
and environmental projects,'' said the official.
   In addition, Geraghty & Miller has acquired United Kingdom-based
Environmental Strategies, Ltd. The ``small firm'' employs six people and
has offices in Leeds and Chester, said Farrell.
   ``Recent growth in both our U.K. and worldwide business sectors requires
more consultants. By merging with Environmental Strategies, staff will be
able to expand our auditing and due diligence work and have a strong
presence in the northwest region of the U.K.,'' said Brian Crook, G & M

RECYCLING INDUSTRIES DOUBLES BUSINESS WITH PURCHASE OF ANGLO METAL

By:
SL

   Recycling Industries has bought for about $4.3 million the business,
land, buildings and equipment of San Juan, Tex.-based Anglo Metal, which
does business as Anglo Iron & Metal. That purchase price includes cash, a
note, a non-compete agreement and 227,693 shares of Recycling Industries
common stock valued at $925,000, said a spokesman.
   The firm was acquired from Robert C. Rome and the Rome family and posted
estimated 1995 revenues of about $15 million, said the spokesman. It is
among the largest ferrous and non-ferrous metals recyclers in the South
Texas Rio Grande Valley with operations in San Juan, McAllen, Harlingen and
Brownsville, all in Texas, he said.
   ``With the Anglo acquisition, we have doubled the size of our
business,'' said Thomas J. Wiens, Recycling Industries chairman and chief
executive officer.
   In addition, the company plans to acquire more metals recycling
operations in 1996, he said. Englewood, Colo.-based Recycling Industries
recently acquired Las Vegas-based Nevada Recycling Industries and 20% of
The Loef Co., based in Athens, Ga., said Wiens. With the Anglo
acquisition, Recycling Industries anticipates annual sales of more than $30
million in 1996, he said.
   ``The one-time and non-recurring expenses associated with this important
acquisition will negatively impact our earnings in our first quarter which
ends December 31, 1995,'' said Wiens. ``We expect to begin recording the
positive impact of these revenues and earnings in the quarter beginning
January 1, 1996.''
   ``The geographic location of the four plants in south Texas are
important as they give us the ability to market, to purchase, and to sell
in Mexico,'' said Mike Price, metals division president and chief operating
officer. ``There is a tremendous amount of metals recycling business
occurring between the U.S. and Mexico.
   ``As the largest metals recycler on the South Texas/Mexico border, we
plan to expand the operations of Anglo to take advantage of the existing
business opportunities and those we expect to see in the next few years as
a result of the NAFTA agreement and the strong industrial growth in the
market,'' said Price.

MONTGOMERY-OTSEGO-SCHOHARIE, N.Y., TO ISSUE RFP FOR SOLID WASTE MANAGER

By:
AR

   The Montgomery-Otsego-Schoharie Solid Waste Management Authority (MOSA)
expects to issue a request for proposals for ``the operation and or
take-over of all or some'' of its functions within the next few months,
according to an official at headquarters at Howes Cave, New York.
   The authority was formed by the three counties in 1987 in response to a
state mandate to seek a regional solution to waste management. Since then,
however, it has become caught up in the national tumult over flow control,
and private haulers have shunned its facilities, which they claim are more
expensive than hauling trash to other facilities in or out of state.
   The last nail in the coffin for MOSA was a decision by the New York
State Department of Environmental Conservation in early December not to
renew a permit for the landfill the authority has been using. Because of
the uncertainty regarding the entire waste management situation, the
authority would not be able to get financing to build another landfill in
time, said the authority official.
   This leaves the authority with no place to dump trash by the end of next
year, he said.
   The central New York region is undergoing rapid changes as large
national firms including Resource Recovery Systems of Greenwich,
Connecticut and Browning-Ferris Industries, Houston, have moved in, taking
over smaller locally-run firms and aggressively competing for business
(Integrated Waste Management, 6 Dec., 3). The authority has already
received a number of phone calls asking for details on its operations, said
the spokesman.
   The authority has $28-million in debt outstanding, continued the
official.
   Further details on what infrastructure is in place and the assets of the
authority will be contained in the request for proposals, he added. MOSA
has hired a bond counsel, general counsel and an engineering firm to
develop the RFP.
   In 1994, the authority processed 104,000-tons of waste. In 1995 this
volume was down to 75,000 to 80,000-tons due to loss of flow control, he
said. When the authority was formed the tipping fee was $85 to $90 per
ton. I t is currently down to $45 to $50 per ton, he continued.
   There are five transfer stations with the trash being landfilled at the
Eastern landfill northwest of Amsterdam, New York. While the state DEC has
not yet officially denied the authority's request to continue to operate
the landfill, DEC officials told the authority the landfill must close at
the end of next year, said the official.

DOE'S NIAGARA FALLS RADWASTE STORAGE SITE SEEN POSING LONG-TERM RISK

   High-level radioactive residues currently stored at the DOE Niagara
Falls Storage Site (NFSS) pose a potential long-term risk to the public if
they are left permanently, according to an new analysis by the National
Research Council.
   The council prepared the report at the request of the Office of
Environmental Restoration of the U.S. Department of Energy. It examined
the existing and proposed modifications of the waste containment structure
in Lewiston, New York, which has been used since 1949 to store highly
radioactive residues separated during the processing of very rich uranium
ores from Zaire.
   The high-level residues remaining after the removal of uranium--used in
the Manhattan Project--along with other, less radioactive residues and
wastes, are currently stored at NFSS, buried under an interim cap to
prevent influx of moisture from precipitation and outflux of radon gas,
said the report.
   The report, ``Safety of the High-Level Uranium Ore Residues at the
Niagara Falls Storage Site, Lewiston, New York,'' is based upon
presentations from DOE and its contractors, a review of documents, and a
visit to the site. The residents of the area and others had the
opportunity to express their views and concerns.
   Based on available site sampling and monitoring information, there is no
immediate hazard to the off-site public from the residues in their current
configuration, said the report. However, DOE's proposed actions of
replacing the interim cap with a ``permanent'' cap and of long-term site
maintenance and monitoring do not address the potential risks to the public
for the long periods of time commensurate with the duration of that
potential risk, it concluded.
   An important alternative, that of solidifying the high-level residues on
site and shipping the solidified residues to an off-site location, has not
been considered. This alternative was chosen for managing essentially
identical residues of common origin currently stored in silos at the
Fernald Environmental Management Project site in Ohio, the study said.
   If this alternative is considered, the occupational as well as public
health safety aspects are important. Inputs from waste treatment
technology projects, such as the project for handling similar residues
currently being implemented at the Fernald site, will provide important
information for making such assessments, said the report.
   Furthermore, the present and potential future interactions between the
NFSS and disposal sites adjacent to it, where non-radioactive toxic
chemical and landfill wastes are currently disposed, have not been
addressed adequately, either in the NFSS final environmental impact
statement or in subsequent studies and documentation, said the analysis.
   The potential future health hazards posed by non-radiological, toxic
materials such as lead and barium that are constituents of the buried
high-level residues at NFSS have not been adequately assessed, it said. In
addition, there are substantial uncertainties in the estimates of costs and
associated risks for managing the residues at the Niagara site that have
not been fully assessed, cautioned the study.
   Current site monitoring activities are inadequate for the determination
of long-term site integrity and potential future risks to the public and
the environment from the movement off-site of radioactive and
non-radioactive wastes in the NFSS containment structure, as well as the
possible influx of waste materials from the disposal sites adjacent to the
NFSS, it said.
   The report made recommendations for future action by DOE to provide
protection to the health and safety of the public and the environment, both
in the short and long terms. DOE should complete studies of related or
similar treatment technologies such as the vitrification demonstration at
the Fernald site (see story on page 10) and related cost-risk-benefit
studies, it advised.
   Further, a program should be developed by DOE for removal, treatment,
and disposal off-site of the NFSS high-level residues. Because there is no
immediate hazard to the off-site public from the residues in their present
configuration, such studies will help ensure proper handling of the
residues when they are removed for disposal, as well as to provide an
example for future remediation of other sites containing radioactive
residues. After removal of the high-level residues, remaining wastes
should be buried under a suitable protective cap, counseled the report.

Eco Waste License
Goes to Sweden

Eco Waste Technologies (EWT, 2305 Donley Dr., Suite 108, Austin, TX
78758-4535; Tel: 512/837-9961; Fax: 512/837-9430) has licensed
Chematur Engineering AB of Karlskoga, Sweden to build a major
demonstration supercritical water oxidation facility with a
capacity of 1 gpm. Dick Lyon of Eco Waste says that the
demonstration plant will use the EWT technology that has been in
operation since 1994 at Huntsman Corp. in Austin, Texas.

Lyon reports that EWT has completed an advanced version of its
Huntsman plant for the University of Texas at Austin. This
experimental facility will replace the original pilot plant and
experiment with the treatment of more complex chemicals and sludges
with 20-30% solids from wastewater treatment plants. Its capacity
is 0.5 to 1 gpm.

R.N. McBrayer and J.W. Griffith of EWT disclose that the Huntsman
facility is treating 5 gpm of wastes from experimental chemical
processes and washdowns at Huntsman's Austin Research Labs. The
waste contains about 70% washwater and a mixture from three primary
waste streams of long-chain alcohols, glycols, and amines. The
mixture has a total organic carbon concentration of more than
50,000 mg/l and 6,908 mg/l ammonia. Effluent is required to meet
the pretreatment standards of the city of Austin which means a
monthly average below 100 mg/l organic carbon and less than 20 mg/l
ammonia.

A positive displacement pump pressures the feed to over 24.8 mPa
and passes it through a heat exchanger. The addition of oxygen in
the reactor raises reactor temperatures to 538-650C. Effluent
consisting of water saturated with carbon dioxide passes through
the heat exchanger, a heat recovery boiler, and an effluent cooler
before depressurization to atmospheric pressure in a liquid/gas
separator. Excess oxygen level measurements in the liquid/gas
separator are used to control the oxygen injection rate in the
reactor.

Liquid effluent is held for sampling before discharge. In
continuous operation, the effluent has less than 50 mg/l TOC
consisting of acetic acid or other simple organic acids, and the
chemical oxygen demand is less than 16 mg/l. Ammonia concentrations
are 2.7 to less than 1 mg/l, and nitrate levels are within
acceptable limits at 6.4 mg/l. Dissolved solids consist mostly of
sulfate, chloride, potassium, and sodium salts. Total bicarbonate
at 13,900 mg/l is high because the effluent is saturated with
carbon dioxide from the oxidation of organic matter.

EWT has determined that the alloy used in the Huntsman facility has
resisted corrosion caused by chlorides in feedwater. The unit is
designed for operation 24 h/d and 320 d/yr. It is scheduled for
descaling every 3 weeks using a nitric acid solution to remove
carbonate scale from the heat exchanger. Some pump seals and
packings have been replaced, but McBrayer and Griffith report no
safety-related incidents or problems with reactor operation and
system control in the first year of operations. They conclude that
it has demonstrated the ability to routinely treat the basic C-H-O-
N compounds in chemical process waters.

Catalysts Used to
Promote Oxidation

The University of Tulsa (Dept. of Chemical Engineering, Tulsa, OK
74104) has demonstrated an effective method of destroying organic
compounds contained within an aqueous waste stream.  Catalytic
supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) is effective in the
destruction of the original organic compound. Incomplete conversion
to low molecular weight partial oxidation products may be achieved.

For years, wet oxidation has been successfully used as a
destructive treatment for many organic species.  Increased
destruction efficiency has been obtained by increasing the reaction
temperature to that above the critical temperature of water or
through the addition of a catalyst.  During SCWO, advantage is
gained in that the organic components and the oxygen are all
present in a single, dense, fluid phase, minimizing mass transfer
resistance and providing relatively rapid reaction rates.

The oxidation of phenol is of practical interest since it is a
common pollutant in industrial waste streams and is also believed
to be an intermediate product in the oxidation pathway of higher
molecular weight aromatic hydrocarbons.  Catalytic wet oxidation of
phenol over a CuO catalyst has been previously investigated.  The
reaction kinetics were determined and were thought to proceed
through a homogeneous-heterogeneous mechanism.  The homogeneous
reaction pathway caused an induction period during which free
radicals were accumulated in the aqueous phase.  Numerous reaction
intermediates, including benzoquinones, acetic acid, and other low
molecular weight organic acids, have been identified.

Some of the products identified from supercritical water oxidation
of phenol represent compounds that are more hazardous than the
starting organic component.  In order to minimize the formation of
these partial oxidation products and to promote complete
conversion, it is feasible to either increase the reaction
temperature or add a catalyst.

The University of Tulsa study, published in Environmental Science
& Technology [29, 2748-2753, 1995], gives a more detailed analysis
of the use of a heterogeneous catalyst to promote the oxidation of
phenol.  Several partial oxidation products have been identified,
and a reaction model involving a sequence of parallel and series
reaction pathways has been developed.  The performance of several
heterogeneous catalysts has been compared.

Discarded Medical
Materials Disinfected

Engineers at the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI, 6220 Culebra
Rd., P.O. Drawer 28510, San Antonio, TX 78228-0510; Tel: 210/684-
5111) are testing the efficiency of a new medical waste treatment
system manufactured by Med Compliance Services (MCS, El Paso Dr.,
El Paso, TX 79905; Tel: 915/772-2288).  The Encore-2100 system
first shreds the material, reducing its volume, then disinfects the
waste by exposure to a chlorine dioxide solution.  The chemical
treatment system is an alternative to incineration processes which
have traditionally been used to dispose of medical waste but have
been threatened by the scheduled implementation of federal
regulations.

The EPA estimates that 3.4 million tons of waste are produced
annually by U.S. health care facilities.  Hospitals are the single
largest generator of that waste, contributing some 70% of the total
in the form of contaminated dressings, biopsy specimens, laboratory
wastes, needles and syringes, and blood and blood products.  About
3,000 hospitals now use incinerators as their primary means of
medical waste disposal.

The problem is that, as required by the Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990, the EPA has issued a proposed rule, to be finalized by April
15, 1996, that would impose stringent pollution control
requirements on medical waste incinerator operators to reduce toxic
waste emissions such as dioxins and metals.  Implementation of the
control measure is expected to significantly increase equipment and
operating costs, making on-site incineration economically
impractical for many hospitals.  Some waste treatment industry
sources estimate that the rule could force the closure of 80-90% of
existing medical waste incinerators.

James Scott, senior research engineer, has led the SwRI effort to
design test protocols for and perform third party, independent
testing of the Encore-2100 system to assess its compliance with
standards established by the EPA and the State and Territorial
Association of Alternate Treatment Technologies (STAATT), a
consortium of state medical waste regulators.  The Encore-2100,
with a maximum production rate of 2,000 lbs./hr., is designed to
effectively and safely treat infectious waste so the processed
materials can be disposed of in a conventional solid waste
landfill, says Scott.  Two specially configured industrial
shredders in series reduce waste volume significantly and enhance
contact between al the waste components and the chlorine dioxide
solution, which is introduced during and after shredding.

Chlorine dioxide, the key component in the chemical disinfecting
solution, is commonly used to treat drinking water and wastewater.
It can be generated through a reaction involving sodium
hypochlorite, hydrochloric acid, and sodium chlorite solutions, or
by mixing gaseous chlorine and sodium chlorite solutions.  The
method used in the Encore-2100 technology involves a reaction of
the chemicals under vacuum to create gaseous chlorine dioxide.

The key feature of the gas generation system, manufactured by Rio
Linda Chemical Co. (North 10th St., Sacramento, CA 95814; Tel:
916/443-4939), is its single ejector, which creates a vacuum,
bringing the premeasured chemicals together to form gaseous
chlorine dioxide, and introduces the gas into an aqueous solution.
The disinfecting solution is removed from the waste using a
helipress and then recirculated and returned to the desired
concentration prior to reuse in the treatment process.  Release of
airborne contaminants is controlled by a high efficiency
particulate air (HEPA) filter and scrubber units.

Scott explains the SwRI designated two protocols to measure the
effectiveness of the Encore-2100 system.  One protocol tests the
system relative to EP requirements for sanitizing inanimate,
nonfood contact surfaces.  This part of the study is being
conducted in accordance with EPA Good Laboratory Practices.  The
second protocol subjects the Encore-2100 to national standards
developed by STAATT.  To satisfy these standards, the system must
demonstrate a 99.9999% reduction in selected microorganism species
representing vegetative bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, and
tubercle mycobacteria.  In addition, the process must demonstrate
a 99.99% reduction in bacterial spores, including highly resistant
forms of Bacillus.

SwRI incorporated stringent quality assurance controls to encompass
all aspects of the study, including sources and culturing of the
microorganisms, processing of waste through the Encore-2100 system,
and microbiological analyses of the samples.  Quality assurance
documents generated during the study validate the sample results
and allow the complete reproduction of the experimental results.
SwRI has collected about 150 samples from the Encore-2100 process.
 The first commercial unit will be installed at an existing MCS
facility in Albuquerque, NM.

Hydrothermal Oxidation
of Chemical Weapons

The Dept. of Defense (DOD) and General Atomics (3550 General
Atomics Ct., San Diego, CA 92121; Tel: 619/455-3000, Fax: 619/455-
2263) demonstrated that a hydrothermal oxidation (HTO) technology
can safely destroy chemical weapons and solid rocket propellants
without incineration. HTO uses water heated to 500F  and
pressurized to 4000 psi to mix oxygen or air with organic
contaminants, forming carbon dioxide, water, and sometimes, mineral
salts or acids.  No harmful emissions are produced and all end
products can be safely disposed of, recycled, or released.

According to Jeff Broido of General Atomics, the unit destroys the
nerve agents VX, GB and mustard gas beyond the limits of detection.
Research is looking into how to deal with the heavy amounts of
chlorine generated, and the corrosion it brings, when destroying
such weapons.

While water usually repels such materials, the pressure and heat
allow it to mix and oxidize.  Broido says that the trick is that
the water's behavior is reversed.  It behaves like a non-polar
solvent. The bench-scale HTO unit General Atomics operates in San
Diego is being used to test a variety of hazardous materials for
commercial use.

Iron Curtain Holds
Back Contamination

Hydrogeologist Robert Gillham of the University of Waterloo Centre
for Groundwater Research (Waterloo, Ontario, Canada) continues
research on a permeable subsurface treatment wall containing iron
filings and sand to purify contaminated groundwater. Last fall
articles first began appearing in the scientific literature on the
use of iron filing walls to keep out toxic wastes. Since then, this
new technology has been rapidly attracting attention as an
economically competitive tool for groundwater remediation and
treatment.

Gillham's wall, located at a test site in Waterloo, separates two
water bodieson one side is contaminated groundwateron the other,
water almost clean enough to drink.  Goundwater contaminated with
volatile organic compounds flows through the wall naturally, and a
chemical reaction purifies the water.  The process could be used at
thousands of hazardous waste sites needing remediation, according
to Gillham.

Gillham started to develop the method when he noticed
irregularities in water samples taken from plastic-lined wells.
The plastic absorbed contaminants and biased water quality
measurement.  Samples taken from wells with metal casings showed
even lower contaminant levels without absorption into the metal.

The reason for this phenomenon was corrosion.  The contaminant
reacts with iron, forming harmless byproducts, including chloride,
ethene, and ethane.  The reaction leaves no waste material to
contain, transport, and dispose.  With a high enough iron content,
contaminated groundwater can be treated to meet drinking water
standards.

Gillham has used a 20% iron concentration for more than four years
at the test site to treat groundwater contaminated with 250 mg/L of
trichloroethylene (TCE) and 45 mg/L of tetrachloroethylene (PCE)
with no detectable deterioration of the medium.  Although the
treated water does not meet drinking water standards, Gillham says
this could be possible if a higher concentration of iron were used.

To use the corrosive reaction for groundwater cleanup, the
direction and depth of the contaminated flow must be known, a
trench dug, and the reactive formulation placed in the hole.  The
iron and sand wall has a higher permeability than the surrounding
soil, allowing the contaminated groundwater to flow freely through
the reactive material.  Residence times, depending on the
concentration of the contaminant, are about two days.

During the reaction, pH increases and minerals precipitate out of
the water to form calcium carbonate, which could clog the media and
cause the groundwater to flow around the wall.  To restore
permeability, the iron filings can be stirred to increase porosity.
Inorganic mineral precipitates cause 2-15% losses in porosity per
year.  Spent iron can be replaced.  No stirring or media
replacement is expected to be needed for at least 10 years at the
test site.

Capital costs for installing the treatment wall system are
comparable to pump and treat methods.  The only operation and
maintenance costs, other than periodic groundwater sampling, could
involve stirring up the media, according to John Vogan, manager of
EnviroMetal Technologies (42 Arrow Rd., Guelph, Ontario N1K 1S6
Canada; Tel: 519/824-0432), a company set up by Gillham to market
the patented technology.  A 180 meter long by 9 meter deep (600' x
30') funnel and gate system to treat 50-60 mg/L TCE and 10 mg/L PCE
in a high velocity aquifer would cost about $1.5 million.

Waste Stays Behind
Wall of Iron Filings

A proposed wall of iron filings to protect four Massachusetts towns
from contaminated water coming from the former Massachusetts
Military Reservation was first described in an article in Science
[269, 473, 1995]. Unlike slurry walls and similar physical
barriers, the iron filings will form a permeable but reactive
barrier to break down trichlorethylene, tetrachloroethylene, and
other chlorinated contaminants.

This proposed iron (Fe) barrier is a product of continuing research
into methods to treat groundwater contaminants in place without the
usual pump-and-treat operations. Engineers in Oklahoma have
conducted lab tests which explain how iron filings can reduce
Cr(VI) in groundwater to Cr(III).  Robert M. Powell (ManTech
Environmental Research Services Corp., P.O. Box 1198, Ada, OK
74821-1198), Robert W. Puls, Sharon K. Hightower, and David A.
Sabatini conducted stirred batch reactor experiments in darkened
500 ml reactors with simulated aquifer water, scrap iron filings,
and alluvial aquifer material.

The competitive desorption of CrO4-2 from surface absorption sites
by excess PO4-3 resulted in nearly full recovery of chromium from
experiments without iron filings. In experiments with iron filings,
chromium was reduced from 109 mg/l to below 0.3 mg/l and there was
no subsequent CrO4-2 recovery by PO4-3 desorption, confirming
reduction by iron. Powell's group found that different forms of
metallic iron have greatly different abilities to reduce chromate.
Impure and partially oxidized iron is the most effective.

Powell's observations of changes support the theory that an
electrochemical corrosion cell on the surface of an iron filing
causes the thermodynamic instability that drives oxidation-
reduction reactions without external energy input. Iron in the
zero-valence state is an electron donor, and chromate ions serve as
oxidants in such cells. Powell wrote in Environmental Science &
Technology [29-8, 1913-1921, 1995] that the corrosion cell is a
stable domain with clearly defined anodic and cathodic regions.

Differences in the surface potential of impure iron filings due to
composition or grain structure and orientation result in unstable
regions and electron movement. Previously rusted surfaces are sites
of dissolution where potentially unfilled electron shells exist
next to filled electron shells, and reaction rates are high. An
anodic region develops where there is an electron deficiency, and
it has a positive charge and Fe++ ions at the surface. They are free
to enter the solution.

Powell suggests that the positively charged zone electrostatically
attracts chromate and sulfate ions, promoting formation of the
Fe2SO4 complex and redox coupling of chromate ions. The negatively
charged cathodic region of the surface is dominated by cations and
non reducible sodium and calcium ions. Aluminosilicates in aquifers
are able to provide electron acceptors to maintain the dissolution
of iron surfaces.

In the case of the Massachusetts project, Fe++ ions in corrosion
cells on iron filings would strip chlorine ions from chlorinated
hydrocarbons in moving groundwater and turn them into harmless
ethene and ethane. Summary report EPA542-S-95-001 from the Solid
Waste Office of the Environmental Protection Agency states that
four demonstration projects are using metal-enhanced dehalogenation
under a patent held by the University of Waterloo.

Creative Techniques
Help Landfill Problem

Trial and error has been the "engineering" method used to develop
some of the most effective landfill management techniques.  This
has also been the case at Florida's Citrus County Landfill, where
erosion control has been aggravating operators since the facility
opened in January 1990.  The landfill is located in west-central
Florida, approximately 15 miles east of the Gulf of Mexico.

The current plan, a 17-acre plastic-lined cell, is the first of six
phases designed to last 30 years.  With a surface elevation of 120
ft. above sea level and a depth of 80 ft., the landfill is unique
in Florida, where shallow water tables can limit excavation depths.
Side slopes, three of which are lined, are a steep 2:1 (horizontal
to vertical) ratio.  The unlined side contains an entrance road
extending down into the cell.

Although ditches were used on the unlined slope to control erosion,
maintenance was a continuous nightmare.  Attempts to hydroseed
mulch were ruined by rainstorms that washed away the seed before it
took root.  The rain also formed gullies which deepened with each
storm.  The landfill was kept open only by periodically
reconstructing the slopes using bulldozers to excavate eroded soils
from the stormwater pond.

After a catastrophic 11 inch rainfall laid waste to slopes that had
been restored only months before, stapled sod was installed over
burlap cloth on all unlined slopes.  The solution has required only
minor maintenance since installation two years agohelping to make
the costly $4/sq. yd. installation price palatable.

When the price of sod can't be justified, operators use seed and
seaweed mulch on slopes that are angled at 4:1 or flatter.  Citrus
County used hydrilla and water hyacinth removed from nearby canals
to enrich the soil and facilitate seed germination by retaining
moisture.

The liners required by law have also contributed to the landfill's
erosion problems.  Erosion tends to occur at the edge of liners,
since the synthetic liner sheds nearly 100% of contacted
stormwater.  Sheet flow concentrates at the bottom of the line and
erosion occurs where flows become concentrated on steep slopes.
When the soil layer next to the liner is eroded away, solid waste
can become exposed and contaminate the stormwater.  Fortunately,
erosion can be controlled at the liner edge by constructing a ditch
lined with plastic sheeting.  Costs for manpower and equipment are
about $4.60/linear foot of ditch.

Officials at Citrus County landfill prefer a lined ditch to sod or
staked sod with burlap because it will stand up to most any flow
velocity.  Lined ditches also provide a barrier to leachate and do
not have to be watered or mowed.  LDPE sheets work well when
applied in 60 foot sections or longer.  A woven, coated, 3-ply
geomembrane of LDPE with carbon black for ultraviolet light
resistance is available for about $1.17/sq. yd. for 16 mils and
$1.80/sq. yd. for 20 mils.

Million Dollar
Challenge Extended

The results from Monsanto's (800 N. Lindbergh Blvd., St. Louis, MO
63141; Tel: 314/694-1000) first One Million Dollar Challenge were
so encouraging, the company is bringing the program out for an
encore.  Another one million dollars will be awarded to the
individual or team that develops the most cost-effective and
commercially practical technology for producing a clean sodium
chloride stream while recovering high purity amino acids and both
phosphoric and phosphorous acids from a complex wastewater stream.

The initiative supplements Monsanto's ongoing internal program to
eliminate waste and strengthen environmental performance.  An
independent group of experts from the Center for Waste Reduction
technologies (part of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers)
will evaluate the proposals submitted in response to the second
challenge.

From proposals submitted, technology which most effectively meets
the criteria will be funded with $500,000 for one year of
development.  A second $500,000 payment will be made following
successful demonstration of this technology in a continuous
laboratory unit.  All proposals must be submitted by March 31. To

Decrying Cement
Kiln Absolution

One month after the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission
(TNRCC) released a study that absolved Midlothian's cement and
steel plants of producing hazardous emissions, activists have
expressed skepticism over the study results.

Sue Pope, leader of the environmental group Downwinders at Risk,
was one of about 300 residents who attended the TNRCC's meeting in
Midlothian.  State officials at the meeting reviewed results of
their soil-and-air samples study, which has been conducted in the
Midlothian area since 1991.

The report summarized the results of over a thousand samples
collected which indicated that exposure to the monitored levels are
not likely to result in adverse health effects. Where relevant
comparison data were available, air and soil concentrations
measured in Midlothian were found to be similar to those measured
in other Texas communities.

But Pope said her family's deteriorating health is proof enough
that the emissions from Midlothian's steel and cement industries
are harmful.  Pope said the family had some very unexplained
illnesses that began in 1986.  Pope's own health problems since
1986 have included malignant tumors, endometriosis, respiratory
problems, chronic fatigue and autoimmune disorders.  She said her
family's livestock has developed mysterious problems as well,
including cancer, tumors and high numbers of multiple births.  The
Midlothian area also has a higher-than-normal occurrence of
children born with Down's syndrome and adults with cancer and
tumors, Pope said.

The TNRCC's study detailed how 176 soil samples were conducted at
160 sites in and around Midlothian, Center, Carthage, Cleburne,
Terrell and Quitman for polychlorinated dibenzodioxin and
polychlorinated dibenzofuran concentrations.  They found no
significant emissions or high levels of toxins.  Additionally, the
state agency conducted a screening risk analysis for Midlothian's
Texas Industries Inc. (TXI) plant and concluded that based on the
estimated emissions and the assumptions made during this analysis,
the excess lifetime carcinogenic risks and non-cancer hazards that
result for exposure to contaminants potentially emitted from the
Texas Industries Inc. facility are considered to be within an
acceptable range.

But Pope and other residents do not believe the TNRCC's study went
far enough in trying to determine potential health risks from
emissions.  She questioned why a screening analysis, rather than a
health-risk assessment, was conducted about TXI's emissions.  Pope
and others believe that the study's results were released at this
time to hush up the subject and may have been due to political
pressure from the Republican-led state legislature and governor's
office.  Downwinders at Risk has asked the EPA to investigate
emission levels from Midlothian's industries, and expect
preliminary results of the study within a few weeks.

BFI Plans on
One-Time Charge

Browning-Ferris Industries Inc. (BFI, 757 N. Eldridge Pkwy.,
Houston, TX 77079; Tel: 713/870-8100 ) announced plans to record a
one-time charge of $0.05/share in its second quarter, ending March
31, from the redemption of $745 million in debt.   The company said
it called its $400 million of 6-3/4% convertible subordinated
debentures due 2005 and its $345 million of 6-1/4% convertible
subordinated debentures due 2012 for redemption on February 2,
1996.

BFI said it believes the redemption will enhance shareholder value
because the debentures would have been convertible for about 16
million shares of the company's common stock.  The redemption also
allows the company to refinance the debt at more favorable rates,
the company said.

The 6-1/4% debentures will be redeemed for 101.25% of face value
plus accrued interest, with a conversion price of $41 per share.
The 6-3/4% debentures will be redeemed for 101.00% of face value
plus accrued interest, with a conversion price of $52.50/share.

The announcement comes two weeks after Browning-Ferris filed a
shelf registration for $1 billion in debt and equity securities.

VECTRA Delays Its
EnviroGlass Startup

VECTRA Technologies Inc. (1010 S. 336th St., No. 220, Federal Way,
WA 98003; Tel: 206/874-2235, Fax: 206/874-2401) said Thursday it is
temporarily suspending all construction and startup activities
associated with its EnviroGlass vitrification program.

VECTRA, which supplies technology and services to the power
industry, said suspending the vitrification program will have a
near-term positive effect on cash flow since the company expected
to spend a considerable amount of money to complete and transport
the unit.

The company said that it is too soon to tell if the suspension will
have any serious long-term effects.  VECTRA said suspending the
vitrification program was necessary because delays in placing its
transportable vitrification unit at its lead client's site made it
impossible to meet the client's schedule to dispose of the low-
level waste.  VECTRA is now negotiating to remove and process the
waste on a subcontract basis.   However, if it is not successful in
these negotiations, VECTRA may be forced to accept contract
cancellation.

The company said it will be actively pursuing new contracts for the
vitrification technology and if VECTRA wins another project, the
program will be reactivated.   VECTRA also said it continues its
previously announced program to sell assets or raise additional
capital in an effort to eliminate long-term bank debt by the first
quarter of 1996.

Committee Approves
EPA's Use of TEFs

The Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) Science Advisory Board
has supported the agency's use of "toxic equivalency factors"
(TEFs) in a draft review of dioxin risk reassessment.  TEFs are
calculations that equate dioxin with several other dioxin-like
chemicals (polychlorinated biphenyls, for example) to assess human
health risks.

Although individual board members questioned the use of TEFs, the
committee supported the calculations as the best available tool for
risk assessment.  A peer review of TEF that would focus on
interactions between chemicals that affect toxicity was suggested
by the committee, however. The agency is revising the dioxin
reassessment and expects to report to the board next year.

DOI Incurs
Rath of EPA

The Dept. of the Interior (DOI) has incurred the wrath of the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by operating a hazardous
waste facility without a permit at an Indian reservation.  The DOI
stored over 2000 gal. of ignitable hazardous waste containing
chromium and lead at its Fort Defiance Navajo Agency facility (Fort
Defiance, AZ), some of it for more than 10 years.

The EPA is recommending a $269,019 fine for this violation of the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and demanded DOI move
the waste to a treatment, storage or disposal facility within 30
days.  The EPA recently cited DOI for a similar violation in
another part of Arizona.

Lessor Responsible
for Sham Operation

In the late 1980s, Asphalt Recovery Systems (Chicago, IL) began
piling asphalt debris on a seven-acre site in Chicago leased from
D. Raymond Shane.  The company claimed to be stockpiling the
material to recycle for road patching work.  In 1989, the city sued
Asphalt Recovery for operating a landfill on a site without a
permit and won a $4.8 million judgment for cleanup costs.

After Asphalt Recovery went out of business in 1993 leaving no
usable assets, the city sued Shane, contending that he had a duty
to check up on his tenant.  Having failed to do so, Shane was, in
the city's eyes, responsible for any environmental damage.  The
city code contains a provision in place that assigns financial
responsibility for environmental cleanups to landlords.

A Cook County circuit court judge ruled that, under the city code,
Shane was responsible for cleaning up the 300,000 tons of debris on
his property.  Henry Henderson, Chicago's environmental
commissioner, said that the decision sends a clear message to
unscrupulous operators masquerading as recyclers that they are
operating under a false assumption if they believe they can dump
their trash in Chicago and let taxpayers clean it up. Shane's
attorney has promised an appeal.

EPA Discovers
Something Fishy

A 20% increase in the number of fish consumption advisories were
reported by state health agencies during fiscal 1994, according to
a survey compiled by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
The agency reported that 46 states have issued advisories, and
seven have statewide noticesFlorida, Maine, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, and New York.  Since the survey was
compiled, New Hampshire and Vermont have also issued statewide
advisories.

Fourteen percent of US lakes, 4% of U.S. rivers, all of the Great
Lakes, and most coastline are currently under advisories.  More
than 60% of the advisories are for mercury, primarily from coal-
burning power plants, incinerators, and industrial sites.  Other
contaminants triggering advisories include polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs), the pesticide chlordane, DDT, dioxin, and other
toxic substances that can accumulate in fish tissue.

The increase in advisories does not necessarily mean that lakes and
rivers are more pollutedit could signal an expansion of state
monitoring and assessment efforts.  Minnesota, for example, listed
565 advisories, more than double that of any other state.

And simply because a state has more waterbodies under advisory does
not mean that these states have the worst fish contaminant
problems.  According to Jeff Bigler of the EPA's Office of Water,
the high number of advisories more likely characterize both the
level of effort put into identifying waterbodies of concern and the
assessment methods used by the state for developing fish
consumption advisories.

Bigler says that the criteria for issuing an advisory often varies
from one state to another, with different thresholds used as the
basis for issuing advisories.  EPA Administrator Carol Browner
announced the release of a new EPA database, the National Listing
of Fish Consumption Advisories, during a speech at the American
Fisheries Society in Tampa, FL.  The database includes information
on the types of advisories, the species of fish affected, the
chemicals included in the advisory, locations, dates of issue, and
contact names and telephone numbers.  Maps allow users to select
between regions, states, chemicals, species, and a number of other
parameters for narrowing an advisory search.

The National Listing of Fish Consumption Advisories is available to
the public on five computer disks and will be upgraded annually.
The listing also is available on the Internet at
http://www.epa.gov/water.

GAC Improves
Biofilter Effect

A team of researchers from the National Tsing Hua University (Hsin
Chu, Taiwan, ROC) and Union Chemical Labs (ITRI, Hsin Chu, Taiwan,
ROC) have joined together to systematically investigate the
transient behavior of biofilters during shut down, restart
operations and shock loading.  Toluene was used as the gas
pollutant in the study.

Biodegradation processes have been validated as a promising
alternative to other conventional air pollution control
technologies.  Toluene is a toxic air pollutant and a common
constituent emitted from many industrial processes, such as
chemical manufacturing, painting, and petroleum refining.  An
economically feasible control method would be advantageous in light
of increasingly stringent regulation for air emissions of volatile
organic compounds (VOCs).

With the easily biodegradable nature of toluene, biofiltration of
air emissions containing this pollutant is considered a preferable
alternative to other traditional physical and chemical air
pollution control methods, including scrubbing, incineration, and
activated carbon adsorption.  Advantages of this process include
low investment and operating costs, high removal efficiency and
reliable operational stability.  Furthermore, high destruction
efficiency of the pollutant in the biofilter causes no secondary
pollution.

Biofiltration can be described as a process that utilizes microbial
activity for the aerobic degradation of pollutants.  A biofilter
contains filter materials (mainly compost or peat) on which
microorganisms are immobilized to form a biolayer.  When waste
gases pass through the reactor, target pollutants diffuse into the
biofilm with subsequent aerobic biodegradation.  In general,
natural filter materials provide sufficient inorganic nutrients for
microorganisms, thus the addition of inorganic nutrients is not
required.

In the Taiwan study, experiments were conducted in three
laboratory-scale biofilters with mixtures of chaff/compost,
diatomaceous earth (DE)/compost, and granular activated carbon
(GAC)/compost, respectively, as the filter materials.  The response
of each biofilter to shock loading was studied by abruptly changing
the concentration or flow rate of the inlet gas.  For each
transient operation, toluene concentration was continuously
measured until a new steady state was achieved.

According to their report, published in Hazardous Waste & Hazardous
Materials [12, 3, 1995], the researchers found that the biofilters
responded effectively to the shut down and restart operation and
shock loading of toluene concentration or gas flow rate.  In
addition, the highly adsorptive GAC could improve the biofilter
performance, especially for the treatment of less water soluble
compounds.  The GAC/compost biofilter had the highest maximum
elimination capacity of 97 (g hr-1m-3).

Essex Team Treats
Landfill Leachate

High concentrations of sulfate in wastewater streams subjected to
anaerobic digestion have been considered undesirable because of the
production of sulfide during digestion, which can inhibit
methanogenesis.  It has been reported that a >76% removal of
organic COD is possible when high sulfate wastewater (from an
edible fat manufacturer) was anaerobically digested, although only
21-45% overall COD was removed because of sulfide remaining in the
effluent.

Appreciable sulfate may be present normally in effluents, and
anaerobic digestion results in low biogas formation and high
concentrations of sulfide in the effluent.  Anaerobic digestion has
also been successful in removing high sulfate concentrations from
mine waters and contaminated groundwater.

Scientists at the University of Essex (Dept. of Biology, Colchester
CO4 3SQ, England) have finished a study in which landfill leachate
was treated in upflow hybrid (sludge-bed/fixed-bed) anaerobic
reactors by both methanogenic digestion and by sulfate-reducing
digestion (Water Resources; 30, 1, 1996).

The University of Essex study achieved steady state removal
efficiencies of COD under methanogenic digestion of 81-97%,
depending upon organic loading rate; and effective treatment
occurred up to a volumetric COD loading rate of 3.75 kg COD m-3 d-1.
In sulfate-reducing digesters SO24- was converted stoichiometrically
to dissolve H2S, driving organic matter mineralization.  Sulfate
concentrations of 35, 105 and 175 mM in the feed resulted in SO24-
removal efficiencies of 92, 52 and 35%, respectively.

Steady state removal efficiencies of organic COD in the sulfate-
reducing digesters averaged 62% at 35mM, 80% at 105 mM, and 84% at
175 mM feed SO24- concentrations.  The ratio of COD:SO24- (g/g)
utilized was dependent upon the concentration of SO24- present, and
at 35 M SO24- was 0.67.

At an organic loading rate <1 kg COD m-3 d-1 the sulfate reducing
digesters offered organic removal efficiencies comparable to
methanogenic digesters, but were less effective at higher loading
rates.  Propionate accounted for the majority of the residual COD
in the effluents from the methanogenic digesters, but acetate in
the effluent from the sulfate-reducing digesters.

Removal of sulfide from the reactors was achieved by addition of
iron and by off gassing sulfides, but there was no increase in COD
removal after sulfide removal which indicated that sulfide toxicity
was not significant.  Both methanogenic and sulfate-reducing
reactors completely removed up to 100 ppm Cu, Mn, Ni and Zn added
in the feed, indicating that even methanogenic reactors produce
sufficient sulfide to precipitate these metals completely.

Oak Ridge Technology
License Is Available

A method for the destruction of chlorinated volatile organic
compounds (CVOCs), especially trichloroethylene (TCE) and
chloroform, using vapor phase off-gas treatment is available for
licensing from the Dept. of Energys (DOE) Oak Ridge National Lab,
Earth and Atmospheric Environmental Sciences Division.

The process can be used for both groundwater and soil remediation.
A basic bench scale proof of principle apparatus has been
constructed and tested.  The principal advantages of the process
are expected to be high efficiency, cost effectiveness, and minimal
production of secondary waste.  In addition, production systems
based on this technology are expected to be very compact for a
rather large capacity of CVOCs, should not be subject to fouling,
and are expected to require very minimal maintenance.

Commercial firms interested in procuring a license for this
technology may obtain more detailed technical information about the
invention by requesting and executing a Proprietary Information
Agreement (PIA).  To request a PIA, please contact James R. Palmer,
licensing executive at Lockheed Martin Energy Systems, Inc. (Office
of Technology Transfer, Building 701SCA, M/S 8242, P.O. Box 2009,
Oak Ridge, TN 37831; Tel: 615/574-7472, Fax: 615/576-8543).

Barrier Coatings
Lower Pollution

Nanostructured thermal barrier coatings for use on high efficiency,
low emission, natural gas-fired turbines are the subject of a
research project at Nanomaterials Research Corp. (NRC, 10960 N.
Stallard Place, Tucson, AZ 85737; Tel: 602/575-1354).  The ready
availability of clean natural gas at low prices accelerating the
use of gas turbines.  Over the next 10 years, NRC scientist Tapesh
Yadav projects advanced gas turbines and combined cycles will
account for about 45% of additions to global power generation
capacity.  In order to operate at minimum emission and high
efficiency levels, such equipment will require materials than can
withstand the anticipated high inlet and operating temperatures and
contain the pollutant-laden exhaust.

Nanostructured coatings, which are capable of withstanding the
additional heat, are based on powders with nanoscale dimensions in
the 10-7 - 10-9 meter range.  Such materials could be used in turbine
combustor, blades, vanes, and transition pieces.

Ceramic, Metal Bond
for Hot Gas Filters

Intumescent materials for joining ceramics to metals at high
temperatures in hot gas filtration systems have been formulated by
scientists at CeraMem Corp. (12 Clematis Ave., Waltham, MA 02154-
7035; Tel: 617/899-0467).  Other potential applications for the
materials include heat exchangers, high temperature vehicle
emissions control systems, and heat protection and control systems
for new jet engines.

The cost effective sealing of ceramic components such as
particulate filters to high temperature metal alloys in advanced
coal-based power systems operating at temperatures of up to 1000C
is extremely difficult, reports Robert J. Higgins.  The problem
stems from the large disparity in thermal expansion coefficients of
these two types of materials.

This requirement to seal large gaps between ceramic and metallic
components, coupled with the need to maintain appropriate stress
levels on the ceramic components at all temperatures, places
extreme demands on the properties of the material used to seal the
ceramic-metal gap.  Similar systems operating at lower temperatures
utilize vermiculite-based intumescent mats for this purpose, but
such materials have limited lifetimes when used at temperatures in
excess of 500C and degrade at temperatures above 800C.

CeraMem scientists are investigating the use of multilayer,
biceramic composites that can reversibly expand and contract
between room temperature and 1000C.  These composites will include
various combinations of high temperature oxides fabricated by the
surface modification treatment of thin, tape cast ceramic sheets.

New and Retrofit
Coal Combustor

A new, ultralow nitrogen oxides (NOx) pulverized coal combustor is
under development by engineers at Busek Co., Inc. (19 Kearney Rd.,
Needham, MA 02194-2505; Tel: 508/655-5565). The concept, reports
Vladimir Hruby, is applicable to both new and retrofit wall- and
tangentially-fired utility and industrial boiler systems.

The process focuses on a new method of controlling the
stoichiometry, kinetics, and fuelbound nitrogen evolution in the
fuel devolatilization and initial combustion stages.  An extremely
fuel-rich reaction zone is sustained by the low temperature, highly
oxidizing plasma environment.  The plasma contains highly reactive
oxygen radicals and permits fuel devolatilization at
stoichiometries where fuelbound nitrogen conversion to compounds
other than oxides are favored.

The power consumption required to create the plasma is less than
0.5% of the thermal input of the combustor.  Thermal management
techniques for primary zone combustion limit the formation of
thermal NOx, which results in NOx emissions several times lower
than those in commercially available low NOx burners.  The first
part of the Busek project will involve the expansion of earlier
experience with the plasma ignition and rapid devolatilization of
coal, followed by the demonstration of the new concept.
Experiments will be performed to measure NOx emissions and power
consumption as a basis for the design of a 6 million Btu/hr.
combustor.  Later, the combustor will be built and tested in a
commercial boiler.

Turbine Emissions
Are Reduced

An advanced technology catalytic combustor (ATCC) for application
on ground-base, natural gas-powered turbine engines is under
construction at Precision Combustion, Inc. (PCI, 25 Science Park,
New Haven, CT 06511-1968; Tel: 203/786-5215).

William C. Pfefferle reports that the ATCC will represent an
ultrahigh efficiency, environmentally superior, cost competitive
technology.  He predicts that design innovations will overcome the
limits of earlier catalytic combustion designs and result ultralow
emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) of one
and five parts per million (ppm), respectively.

PCI will first build at least one laboratory prototypes for
demonstration at atmospheric pressure and will then explore design
variations.  Subsequently, a full scale combustor will be built for
demonstration at full pressure in preparation for testing on an
engine. High combustion stability, operability without a preburner,
high turndown, and durability are said to be other advantages of
the ATCC.

Plastics Council
Focuses on Reuse

There are several challenges unique to the recycling of plastics,
including the difficulties associated with identification and
separation, high contamination levels, and costly equipment.  In an
effort to reduce the effect of these problems and boost recovery
rates, the American Plastics Council (APC, 1275 K St., NW,
Washington, DC 20005; Tel: 800/243-5790) is investing in innovative
technologies.

In 1994, the APC opened the Multi-Products Recycling Facility
(MPRF) in Boston, MAthe first large-scale U.S. research and
development facility for plastics recycling.  The facility
transforms plastic contaminated with materials such as metals and
fabric into clean, reusable plastics.  To date, the facility has
processed more than 100,000 lbs. of used plastics from automobiles,
computers, business equipment, and appliances.

Last spring, a new project, operated by MBA Polymers Inc. (829
Heinz Ave., Berkeley, CA; Tel: 510/704-7585) and sponsored by the
APC, was started in Berkeley, CAthe Advanced Plastics Recycling
Pilot Line Facility.  This 10,000 sq. ft. plant aims to develop and
demonstrate advanced mechanical recycling technologies for
plastics.  Specific goals include improving recycling economics by
increasing throughput and reducing capital costs; cleaner post-
processed plastics; and investigation of new separation processes.

The pilot recycling line is reported to process all types of
plastic materials including those containing foreign materials such
as ferrous and nonferrous metals, labels, foam, and wiring.  High
temperature, high pressure water is used to remove paints and
coatings.

Another goal of the APC is to improve identification methods for
used plastics.  For example, the P/ID 28, a near-infrared
instrument developed by Bruker Instruments Inc. (15 Fortune Dr.,
Billerica, MA; Tel: 508/667-9580), under APC sponsorship, is
reported to classify at least 23 different types of plastic,
including black plastics, which are generally difficult to
identify.  The P/ID 28 uses the unique make-up of different
plastics, primarily the long chains of specific chemical species
which determine plastic type, as well as its mechanical, chemical
and physical properties.  When infrared light impinges on the
various chemical species along a polymer chain, they vibrate at
different frequencies, absorbing energy at wave lengths that are
characteristic of specific types of plastic.

Memphis May
Achieve Goal

Recycling appears to be a Memphis, TN growth industry.  With three
new initiatives under way, the local recycling business seems to be
on the verge of a boom.  Construction of the city's $3 million
recycling center has just begun, while the community's curbside
recycling recently spread to another 40,000 homes in the Midtown
area.  Champion Recycling Corp. (4939 Gasmer Dr., Houston, TX
77035; Tel: 713/723-6397, Fax: 713/723-3648) has launched a city-
wide recycling program in Memphis businesses as well as public and
private schools, churches and community centers.

All this activity is expected to help Memphis achieve and come
close to the state of Tennessee's mandate to reduce its wastestream
volume by 25%.  Benny Lendermon, the city's division director of
Public Works, said that Memphis may miss the end-of-the-year
deadline, but the city is well ahead of most areas in Tennessee.

According to the state's Solid Waste Act of 1992, Tennessee
communities are required to show that they have reduced their waste
stream by 25% by the end of the year.  If a community hasn't met
this mandate, it must explain why and what it plans to do to
achieve this waste reduction.  The measure is up for re-
authorization before the Tennessee General Assembly during the
coming session.  It appears most communities will have failed to
meet this requirement, so state lawmakers may discuss extending the
25% reduction mandate.

A contract has been signed between the city of Memphis and FCR Inc.
(1373 E. Moorehead St., Charlotte, NC 28204; Tel: 704/347-0312) to
build a nearly $3 million recycling center on a city-donated six-
acre piece of property.  FCR already operates nine recycling
centers along the Eastern Seaboard and other communities in the
South.  As part of the 10-year contract with the city, Memphis will
receive $50 per ton for the recyclable materials which public work
crews will deliver to the facility as part of its soon-to-be
citywide curbside recycling program.  FCR guarantees Memphis $1
million in revenue a year for the estimated 20,000 tons of material
expected to be generated annually.  The community will save about
$400,000 a year in tipping fees by not taking this waste to the
local landfill.

BioChem Offers
Online Monitor

BioChem Technology Inc. (100 Ross Rd., King of Prussia, PA; Tel:
610/768-9360) has a new biological technology for monitoring
wastewater treatment processes.  BioGuide technology is a real-time
online monitor of bacteria in activated sludge wastewater treatment
plants that allows more accurate control of the treatment process.

Samples are taken and analyzed in the bioreactor and results are
fed to a computer system that can control the pumps and valves of
the treatment process. Jaw Lee, president of BioChem, explains that
the company monitors the bacteria activity inside the process
instead of the conventional way of monitoring bacteria involvement.
The process was developed, Lee says, because BioChem believed that
the wastewater treatment process needs to be controlled just like
any other biochemistry process.

Device Will Sample
Waterborne Residues

Scientists from the Dept. of the Interior (DOI, National Biological
Service, Midwest Science Center, 4200 New Haven Rd., Columbia, MO
65201) and the Fish and Wildlife Service (Vicksburg Field Office,
Vicksburg, MI 39180) used semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) to
passively sample aqueous polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs)
and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) in Bayou Meto, AR.  The
two sites were upstream and downstream from the confluence with a
tributary that delivers PCDDs and PCDFs to the Bayou.

Bayou Meto is a turbid, low-gradient stream that originates in the
highlands of central Arkansas and empties into the Arkansas River
290 km to the southeast.  Near Jacksonville, AR, about 40 km
downstream from Bayou Meto's source, a tributary joins Bayou Meto
from the North.  This tributary, Rocky Branch Creek, is a point
source of PCDDs and PCDFs, especially of 2,3,7,8-
tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and 2,3,7,8-
tetrachlorodibenzofuran (TCDF) to Bayou Meto.

In 1971, the Vertac Co. began manufacturing phenoxy acid herbicides
at a plant in Jacksonville.  Based on extensive contamination with
PCDDs and PCDFs, the Vertac site is ranked 18th on the EPA's list
of 1301 Superfund sites.

Aquatic biota, including fish and amphibians, from Rocky Branch
Creek and Bayou Meto have been found to contain elevated
concentrations of PCDDs and PCDFs.  Wood duck eggs collected from
Bayou Meto 9 km downstream from the confluence with Rocky Branch
Creek contained concentrations of TCDD as high as 510 pg/g on a wet
weight basis.  TCDD exhibits endocrine- and reproduction-disrupting
effects in fish and wildlife.  Laboratory studies indicate that
extremely low concentrations of TCDD can impair reproduction in
these animals.

The semipermeable membrane device and its use as a sampler of
aqueous hydrophobic organic contaminants have been extensively
characterized.  The SPMDs used in the present work can be briefly
described as segments of layflat polyethylene tubing with thin
films of triolein sealed inside.  The devices function as passive,
in situ aquatic samplers that sequester dissolved hydrophobic
contaminants from water.

Following dialysis, cleanup, and fractionation, four replicate 17-g
SPMD samples from each site were analyzed by GC/MS, and four were
evaluated by H4IIE bioassay.  As reported in Environmental Science
& Technology [29, 2886-2892, 1995], traces of only PCDD and PhCDDs
were detected in samples from the upstream site. The TCDD
equivalents obtained by bioassay of replicate SPMD samples agreed
well with results obtained by GC/MS.  The quantities sequestered by
SPMDs at the downstream site were used to estimate the aqueous
concentrations for both compounds as 2 pg/L.

Moringa Seeds
Remove Turbidity

Suleyman A. Muyibi and Lilian Evison (Dept. of Civil Engineering,
University of Newcastle, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 7RU, U.K.) have
continued their tests documenting the usefulness of seeds of
Moringa aptera, the horseradish tree, for water treatment,
especially in tropical developing countries.

Evison reports that the goals of the lab tests were to determine
the multiple effects of five physical factors: rapid and slow
mixing rates, mixing time, dosage of coagulant, and initial
turbidity on the coagulation of turbid water with Moringa seeds.
The engineers wanted to find the best dosage rate and the optimal
values for rapid mix velocity and time and slow mix velocity and
time for turbidities of 50-750 NTU.

For their tests, the investigators used stock dilute kaolin
suspensions with 5 g kaolin, 500 ml distilled water, and 500 ml of
50 mg/l sodium carbonate solution. They prepared samples of
different turbidities by diluting the stock suspension. They ground
dry Nigerian Moringa seeds to a powder and blended 5 g of powder in
200 ml distilled water to extract the active ingredients. They
filtered the suspension and diluted it to make a stock solution of
1,000 mg/l.

To measure the degree of coagulation achieved, an optical
tachometer was used to measure changes in the speed of rotation of
a glass paddle in the test vessel, a 1 l glass beaker. They carried
out 32 randomized tests to determine the effects of operating
variables. Each test used 500 ml of turbid water with a dose of
Moringa solution. After different times of slow and fast mixing,
the mixtures were left to settle for two hours before measurement
of supernatant turbidity.

Evison writes in Water Research [29-12, 2689-2695, 1995] that the
initial turbidity and the strength of Moringa dosage were the most
significant factors in coagulating kaolin suspensions. Within a
dosage range of 50-300 mg/l, Muyibi and Evison found optimum
dosages of 50 and 100 mg/l for initial turbidities of 50-150 NTU
and 250-550 NTU, respectively. An increase in Moringa dosage leads
to a decrease in turbidity up to the optimum dosage, when floc
restabilization begins to increase the residual turbidity.

At an initial turbidity of 50 NTU and an optimum dosage of 50 mg/l,
the optimal velocity gradient for rapid mix is 432/s and 1 minute
at 50 NTU initial turbidity. At 225-750 NTU, the optimum rapid mix
velocity gradient and time were 443/s and 4 minutes. The residual
turbidities at the optimum velocity gradient for rapid mix and time
were <10 NTU at both high and low initial turbidities. It was found
that the higher the initial turbidity of a sample, the lower its
residual turbidity.

Adsorption Power
for Separations

Kent S. Knaebel (Adsorption Research Inc. (6185D Shamrock Ct.,
Dublin, OH 43017: Tel: 614/798-9090) writing in Chemical
Engineering [102-11, 92-102, 1995] set out to review the principles
and capabilities of adsorption. Knaebel defines adsorption as a
separation process that selectively transports components of a gas
or liquid phase to the surface of a solid adsorbent. Adsorption has
the power to make separations beyond the limits of distillation,
absorption, or membrane systems, and that advances in adsorption
technology are opening up new applications in environmental
applications and industrial processes.

Knaebel explains that most adsorption systems consist of a pair of
fixed beds in parallel so that one is regenerating while the second
is adsorbing. The common adsorbent media are silica gel, activated
alumina, activated carbon, zeolites, mordenites, and carbon
molecular sieves. Many other minerals, organic materials, and
synthetic substances are adsorbents. Their key properties are
capacity, selectivity, regenerability, kinetics, compatibility, and
cost. Capacity is a function of surface area, pore size
distribution, iodine number, and molasses number.

Key factors to consider in choosing an adsorbent are adsorption
equilibrium, heat effects, and the dynamics of bed behavior.
Equilibrium and heat effects limit adsorption capacity and
selectivity, as Knaebel shows at length in a detailed discussion of
heat effects, adsorption isotherms, and adsorption dynamics in
relation to design.

Microfiltration
Removes H2S

Air stripping by cascade aeration is the usual method of removing
hydrogen sulfide from groundwater in central Florida. Air stripping
may be economical, but Mark A. Thompson, Uday G. Kelkar, and James
C. Vickers (Malcolm Pirnie Inc., 11382 Rock Landing Dr., Suite 400,
Newport News, VA 23606-4206; Tel: 804/873-8700, Fax: 804/873-8723)
point out that it has many shortcomings. By precipitating elemental
sulfur, air stripping raises turbidity and often creates a smell
around treatment plants. Aeration is not efficient over 6.5 pH, but
a lower pH increases corrosion in the system. Aeration actually
removes about 20% of H2S, and chlorination oxidizes the remainder
to S0.

As an alternative to aeration, Thompson's group conducted
feasibility studies of microfiltration in combination with H2S
chemistry manipulation at Oviedo, FL. Their procedure begins with
reducing pH of alkaline groundwater to <6.5 in order to make H2S
the dominant sulfur specie and make oxidation of H2S to So the
prevailing chemical reaction. They did this by oxidation with
chlorine.

The authors filtered their groundwater supply and pumped it
directly into a chlorination unit, bypassing aeration. This
expedient reduces dissolved oxygen levels. The investigators held
the oxidation/reduction potential (ORP) of the feedwater near zero
by regulating the chlorine dosage and preventing it from turning
positive when So is oxidized to SO4-2.

The goal was to keep the ORP as close to zero as possible in order
to obtain maximum So production. The best dosage was about 6 mg/l
Cl. Jar tests were made to determine the best chlorine dosage.
After chlorination, the authors sent the feedwater through a
microfiltration test unit at a constant flow of 2 gpm or 0.5 g/m2
of membrane area for 3 days. The test unit had a membrane area of
4 m2 with 0.2 micron average pore size. The authors monitored raw
and finished water with a particle counter to observe turbidity.

Thompson reports in Desalination [102, 287-291, 1995] that the test
unit reduced turbidity to <0.2 NTU without any trace of hydrogen
sulfide or any flux reduction. They reduced trihalomethane levels
by 40% from 80-90 micrograms/l by adding alum before chlorination.
Thompson concludes that microfiltration is technically an
alternative to aeration. The product water is odorless and less
corrosive, and the procedure is sensitive and flexible when well
managed.

Multimedia Filters
Remove Oocysts

Because Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and Giardia lamblia cysts
resist disinfection, two Washington engineers have tested
controlling the cysts by using multimedia filtration. The pilot
study shows that multimedia filtration is potentially an important
alternative to disinfection.

Jerry E. Ongerth and Julie Proctor Pecararo (Environmental Health
SC-34, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98105) conducted the
study with a system consisting of direct filtration with inline
flocculation, multimedia filtration, low turbidity and alkalinity
raw water with optimum alum coagulation, and constant rate
operation at 1 gpm or 5 gpm/ft2 of filter. Their feedwater was
Seattle city water seeded with Giardia and Cryptosporidium. The
multimedia filter consisted of a flanged 15.2 cm diameter acrylic
tubing with 45.7 cm anthracite coal, 22 cm silica sand, 14.7 cm
garnet sand, and three grades of supporting gravel.

Ongerth reports in AWAA Journal [87-12, 83-89, 1995] that the pilot
multimedia filter achieved nearly 3 logs (99.9%) removal of
Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and better than three logs removal
of Giardia lamblia oocysts. In view of the 5 micron size of
Cryptosporidium oocysts, Ongerth concludes that direct filtration
by multimedia is effective and that it can be a practical
alternative to disinfection under consistent, well-regulated
operating conditions.

Coated Fiber Optic
Helps Degrade Phenol

While the effectiveness of titanium oxide in photocatalyzing the
degradation of organic and inorganic pollutants is well known, the
development of a practical photodegradation reactor has not been so
easy because absorption and scattering have limited the efficiency
of light utilization in conventional fixed bed and slurry reactors.
Two California engineers believe they have solved this problem by
inventing a fixed-bed photocatalytic reactor system which uses a
TiO2-coated fiber optic cable to transmit light to the
photocatalyst.

Nicola J. Piell and Michael R. Hoffmann (W.M. Keck Labs, California
Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125; Fax: 818/395-3170)
used 3 mm quartz rods and 1 mm quartz optical fibers as substrates
for bonding three coats of titanium oxide from concentrated
suspensions. The reactor system consists of a light source, a
coated fiber-optic bundle, and a reaction vessel. The UV light
source is a 1,000 W xenon arc lamp. The fiber bundle consists of 72
1 mm quartz optical fibers. The reactor is a 227 ml cylindrical
Pyrex vessel with a glass frit and a bottom inlet for introducing
atmospheric oxygen.

Fibers at one end of the cable are inserted individually into the
vessel through holes drilled concentrically 1.5mm apart in the cap.
The vessel has 3 sample ports arranged vertically 1.5 mm apart.
Piell and Hoffman used the system to test the degradation of 190 ml
of a 0.1 mM solution of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP). They monitored
chloride ion production during oxidation by means of a chloride-
selective electrode and ion chromatography. pH changes were
monitored with a pH meter. The disappearance of 4-CP was observed
spectrophotometrically and by high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC).

Peill reports in Environmental Science & Technology [29-12, 2974-
2981, 1995] that complete degradation of 4-CP took 5-13 hrs.,
depending on the input light flux and its incident angle.
Increasing the minimum incident angle of light input increased the
measured efficiency of degradation. Increasing the concentration of
titania in the suspensions for coating the glass fibers increased
their light absorption efficiency.

The overall light absorption efficiency of a bundled array appears
to be a function of both the density of fibers in the array and the
titania coating characteristics. Peill reports that the fiber-optic
reactor has a maximum quantum efficiency of 0.011 for 4-CP
oxidation compared to 0.0065 for a slurry reactor under similar
conditions. This is two orders of magnitude better than previous
fixed bed reactors. The fiber-optic system appears to have the
advantages of a fixed bed reactor and a higher efficiency than a
slurry reactor. There was no heat buildup in the reactor and no
degradation of fiber coatings, except for the heaviest coatings.

It was concluded that coated fiber-optic reactors should be
adaptable to continuous flow or batch operations for treating gas
and liquid streams. The fiber-optic cable frees the photocatalyst
from direct dependence on a light source so that the fiber-reactor
system could be used for in situ remediation in the subsurface.

Anaerobic Breakdown
of Some Toxic Organics

Engineers at Tulane University have quantitatively determined the
anaerobic biodegradability of some toxic organic compounds in
petrochemical wastewaters.

Advantages of anaerobic over aerobic systems include lower energy
consumption, less sludge, and potential recovery of energy from
biogenic methane. John M. Stewart (Dept. of Civil & Environmental
Engineering, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA 70118) and four
associates at Tulane and Union Carbide investigated the effects of
different concentrations of ethylene glycol, acrylic acid,
acrolein, and allyl alcohol on acetate uptake by methanogenic
bacteria. They quantified the biodegradability of each compound and
identified intermediate degradation products.

Stewart reports in Water Research [29-12, 2730-2738, 1995] that the
group used a glucose and acetate fed enrichment culture that was
developed from an anaerobic digester. Anaerobic toxicity assays
were made at 35(C in 150 ml serum bottles filled anaerobically with
45 ml of glucose-acetate medium, 3 ml of nutrient medium, and 2 ml
of 50 g/l yeast extract. Acetic acid was added daily for 11 days
and daily gas production measured. They spiked the test bottles on
the 12th day with different concentrations of the four selected
toxic organic compounds and measured inhibition as the decrease in
methane production in comparison with a control.

It was found that ethylene glycol in concentrations of 5,000-20,000
mg/l completely inhibited acetate utilization by exhausting
alkalinity within 4 days. Lower concentrations are degraded to less
than 5 mg/l. Acetic acid, ethanol, and possibly acetaldehyde were
intermediate products before inhibition.

Acrylic acid inhibited methane production one day after spiking,
but slow recovery followed as volatile acids degraded. Acrylic acid
concentrations up to 100 mg/l can be treated to avoid inhibiting
methanogenesis. Concentrations of 500-1,500 mg/l acrylic acid
inhibit methane production for longer periods but bacterial
degradation to less than 1 mg/l takes place within 40 days.

Acrolein inhibited methane formation at concentrations as low as 10
mg/l immediately after spiking. A slow recovery followed. Recovery
time is directly proportional to acrolein concentration up to 150
mg/l. Allyl alcohol at concentrations up to 4,000 mg/l slowly
inhibited methane production after about 10 days because of slow
build up of volatile acids. However, biological methane potential
tests show that anaerobic bacteria degrade on more than 7% of allyl
alcohol.

Growth Ahead for
Treatment Chemicals

As the nation's water quality proves increasingly inadequate and
the need for clean water becomes more apparent, the U.S. specialty
water treatment chemicals (WTCs) industry continues to offer a
viable means of ensuring plentiful pure water supplies. New and
increasingly stringent environmental and pollution/dumping laws
influence the development of alternative water treatment
technologies (chemistries) that replace existing treatments.

According to Business Communications Co., Inc. report RC-002U,
Specialty Water Treatment Chemicals, the vast domestic water
treatment industry remains a mature yet profitable market. Of that
total market, specialty water treatment chemicals represent about
84%, or about $2.6 billion, and most of its profit. The specialty
water treatment chemicals market should see an average annual
growth rate (AAGR) of 5.3% to the year 2000.

With 1995 sales estimated at $947 million, corrosion and scale
inhibitors represent the largest segment of the specialty water
treatment chemicals. New toxicity requirements, among other
factors, contribute to a forecasted market reaching $1.3 billion in
the year 2000, resulting in a 7.3% AAGR.

Following close behind are the biocides and disinfectants with
projected 1995 sales of $821 million. Concerns about chlorine gas
toxicity and rising prices are making the higher priced yet safer-
to-use specialty biocidal and disinfectant chemicals more
attractive to consumers. The market forecast for 2000 is $984
million at an AAGR of 3.7%.

The coagulants and flocculants segment continues to evolve. With a
1995 market value of $270 million, anticipating a 2000 market of
$319 million, environmental restrictions on wastewater discharges
and the need for water conservation will fuel the growth of this
market. The expected AAGR is 3.4%.

Sales of filter media and adsorbents come primarily from activated
carbon. Those sales are estimated at $202 million in 1995, and are
expected to reach $251 million in 2000, with the 4.4% AAGR
reflecting demand for granular activated carbon, a versatile and
broad-spectrum absorbent.

DNA Test for Live
Crypto Oocysts

Because bacterial culture methods don't work for Cryptosporidium
parvum oocysts, the standard indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA)
method for detecting them in environmental samples relies on
isolation and identification. Christine Wagner-Wiening and Peter
Kimmig (Landesgesundheitsant Baden-Wurttemberg, Weiderholdstr. 15,
D-70174 Stuttgart, Germany) point out that detection by staining
and counting by immunofluorescence microscopy does not distinguish
between live and dead oocysts or between C. parvum and other
species of Cryptosporidium.

Wagner-Weining and Kimmig devised a genetic test which uses a
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect live C. parvum oocysts.
Their excystation protocol before DNA extraction permits
distinguishing between live and dead oocysts.

Kimmig reports in Applied & Environmental Microbiology [61-12,
4514-4516, 1995] that they obtained C. parvum sporozoites by
incubating concentrated oocysts in phosphate-buffered saline
solution (PBS) containing 0.25% trypsin and 0.75% sodium
taurocholate at 37(C for 60 min. They removed the trypsin and
taurocholate by washing and centrifugation, and resuspended the
mixture of oocyst walls, oocysts, and excysted sporozoites in PBS.

Total DNA was extracted from excysted sporozoites by incubation at
58(C in a digestion buffer solution with 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate,
0.015 ml of 10 mg/ml proteinase K solution, 0.2 ml of 10 mM Tris-
HCl, 10 mM EDTA and 50 mM NaCl, and 0.07 ml dithiothreitrol in
water. The authors purified the DNA and eluted the dried, pelleted
extract in sterile water. They used synthetic oligonucleotide
primers CP 397 and CP 1270 to amplify an 873-bp region of a 2,395-
bp DNA fragment which encodes a repetitive oocyst protein.

Kimmig reports that PCR gene probe-positive signals occur only when
live sporozoites are present in the extraction medium after
digestion times of 5-90 min. DNase digestion after excystation
prevented false positive signals from the DNA of dead sporozoites.
The authors tested the specificity of the DNA primers for C. parvum
DNA by attempting to amplify target sequences from 46 other
microorganisms that occur in the same environment. They found no
amplified DNA products.

The sensitivity of their system was determined by direct counting
of serially diluted sporozoites before DNA extraction. Kimmig
reports that the specific 873-bp fragment is faintly visible when
the starting material contains as few as 100 sporozoites. A second
round of amplification sometimes increases sensitivity to 10
sporozoites, but this step is not always reliable. The specificity
and sensitivity of their DNA primers makes it possible to routinely
monitor low numbers of live C. parvum oocysts in environmental
samples.

The shortcomings of IFA are the subject of an editorial article in
Analytical Chemistry [67-12, 731A-734A, 1995] which reviews
alternative methods of detecting C. parvum. These include enzyme-
linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA), flow cytometry with
fluorescent cell sorting, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)
with confocal microscopy or flow cytometry, microscopy combined
with imaging by slow-scan charged coupling device, in vitro cell
culture, and electrorotation assay.

Analytical Chemistry concludes that the best of them takes 24 hours
and none of them yet replaces continuous turbidity measurements by
particle counting as a real-time measure of pathogens. Even though
particle counting is an indirect measure, it determines particle
sizes and warns of particles in the micron size range of cysts and
oocysts.

Differing Views
on Compliance

Its goal of maintaining and protecting surface water quality has
led the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set some very low
limits for a variety of toxic pollutants. The demanding EPA
requirements for testing and reporting prompt contrasting reactions
from the chemical industry and the water treatment industry.

While Anna Rule (Hampton Roads Sanitation District, Virginia Beach,
VA; Tel: 804/874-1287) exposes the impracticalities and
inadequacies of compliance testing, Darrell R. Wilder
(Environmental Services Lab, Eastman Chemical Co., Kingsport, TN
37662-5054) sees compliance testing and waste minimization as
opportunities for self-directed efforts to eliminate sources of
pollution and reduce the burden of testing.

Writing in Water Environment & Technology [7-11, 31-34, 1995] Rule
points out that the minimum concentration at which a chemical's
presence can be determined by a specific method is an exceedingly
minute but imprecise quantity which has nevertheless become a
regulatory goal and performance standard. A method detection limit
(MDL) is the minimum concentration of a substance which can be
identified, measured, and reported with 99% confidence that its
concentration is greater than zero. EPA bases MDL on the standard
deviation of a set of replicate determinations.

The EPA has set water quality criteria for some substances at or
below MDLs without considering the limits of analytical technology.
Compliance with permit limits set below MDLs or at zero is
problematic because measurement errors, variability, and
uncertainty. Measurements at ultradilute levels are consequently
anything but absolutely true and exact determinations.

Rule indicates the flaws in deriving a confidence interval from a
set of determinations and suggests that prediction intervals or
tolerance intervals are more appropriate for estimating the range
of future multiple measurements and the probability that a given
percentage of them attain a given MDL. Rule points out that it
introduces a bias to treat results at or below an MDL as zero or
nondetectable while accepting higher values as true and accurate.

"All measurements, at any level, include defined and unavoidable
imprecision. Analytical and sample variance, or relative standard
deviation of measurements (RSD) is not constant throughout the
concentration range but gradually increases as the results approach
the lower or upper end of the analytical range... The practice of
eliminating low-level data by reporting 'less than' or 'zero' is
called left-censoring and is regarded as an unnecessary loss of
valuable information." While it is statistically valid to use low-
end data, this approach often conflicts with setting regulatory
limits.

Rule favors the calibration curve method as an alternative for
estimating measurement detection limits. This method finds
tolerance intervals for assessing future performance and uses them
to define uncertainty bands on the calibration curve. The analyst
may then compute and define minimum concentrations that have an
acceptable level of confidence with a predetermined RSD. The
calibration curve method is the basis of a proposal presented to
the EPA by a Detection/Quantitation Workgroup representing the
regulated community. Other concepts of MDL may be appropriate, but
the problem is the validity of low-end results. Carefully developed
and documented protocols should allow a more effective validation
and define more appropriate uses although at a higher cost.

Working the higher end of compliance testing, Wilder accepts
compliance testing as a fact of life for environmental discharges
in the chemical industry. Now that the NPDES program has entered a
phase of diminishing returns, the EPA is encouraging a "front end"
approach to pollution control that encourages proactive waste
minimization and pollution prevention.

Government initiatives and voluntary programs have created
financial incentives for chemical companies to go beyond routine
compliance by developing environmental strategies that reflect
environmental responsibility. Writing in Analytical Chemistry [25-
2, 77-89, 1995] Wilder presents a review of some new measurement
technologies for preventing pollution and cutting waste.

Wilder considers technologies for measurement of wasteload
concentrations, flow measurements, monitoring specific waste
components, monitoring networks, process control of activated
sludge treatment systems, and measurement of air emissions. Wilder
believes that internal and self-directed efforts by chemical
companies in all these areas give analysts scope for ingenuity and
creativity in identifying and eliminating sources of toxic
contaminants. Successful results could reduce the burden of
compliance testing.

Overtones in
Budget Stalemate

Congressional action on renewal of the Clean Water Act seems to
have been forgotten during the present confrontation over the
federal budget. Environmental affairs, however, are one of the
issues under contention in the battle to balance the budget.

Republicans are eager to cut spending on environmental programs in
their quest to trim a trillion dollars from the national spending
plan but they appear to be losing public support for any attempt to
limit the ability of the EPA to protect public health and the
environment. It is still not clear how the budget battle will end,
but it seems unlikely that Congress will be able to reform
environmental regulation by punitive budget cutting.

Regeneration Won't
Bog this Absorption

Peat Technologies Corp. (PTC, 9076 Little Sweden Rd., Cook, MN
55723-8814; Tel: 218/666-2962, Fax: 218/666-2963) has received an
exclusive, worldwide license from the University of Minnesota to
manufacture and market a new wastewater treatment product based on
technology developed at the University's Natural Resources Research
Institute (NRRI) in Duluth, MN.  The University has applied for a
patent, consisting of both composition of matter and process
claims, to protect the new technology.

The new material, "MultiSorb 100," is formed into granules of
specially processed peat and was developed after three years of
research at  NRRI.  It has shown outstanding performance in
adsorbing a wide variety of organics and heavy metals from various
wastewater streams.  Being granular in form, the peat particles
resist crushing, are dust-free, have high permeability to water
flow, and resist leaking of organic matter, while at the same time
having good ion exchange capacity.

MultiSorb 100 can be recycled and regenerated just as ion exchange
resins.  In contrast to current ion exchange technology, the
components of hard water or monovalent cations do not significantly
interfere with the binding ability of toxic heavy metal ions such
as zinc, copper, lead, cobalt, and chromium.

PTC has established and is operating a production facility to
produce the material in pilot quantities at the Leoni International
peat operation located south of Virginia, MN.  This facility, which
can produce 1/2 ton of product per day, will be upgraded to produce
24 tons of product per day by the third quarter of 1996.

Roy E. Larson, chairman and CEO of PTC, told WTN that the major
thrust of PTC is to manufacture and market MultiSorb 100 for
extracting metals and organic contaminants from wastewaters.  The
new adsorption material has removed dissolved forms of iron, lead,
zinc, barium, nickel, copper, and ethylene glycol from wastewater
at the laboratory-scale level.  Several successful tests have also
been made in the field using actual wastewater streams.  In many
cases, the effluents met drinking water standards and other
discharge criteria.

Because MultiSorb 100 can best handle wastewaters having pollution
concentrations of less than 500 ppm, it is most efficiently applied
as a polishing step in an overall wastewater treatment process,
following a membrane system for instance.  PTC's short term
objectives are to commercialize the new technology and to identify
the market niches where it is an efficacious and cost-effective
treatment method for the removal of metals and organics from
wastewaters.  The company is interested in developing various
strategic relationships to introduce the product and to establish
a marketing and sales effort.

Champion Closes the
Loop for Pulp Mills

Champion International Corp. (1 Champion Plaza, Stamford, CT 06921;
Tel: 203/358-7000, Fax: 203/358-2975) has begun commercial-scale
testing of its new Bleach Filtrate Recycle (BFR) Process at its
pulp and paper mill in Canton, NC. Champion says the BFR Process
has the potential to reduce the discharges of dissolved organic
matter from bleached-kraft mills and that it is an advance to the
goal of a closed loop system that will eliminate all process
effluents from the bleaching of paper pulp.

Champion developed BFR with the technical support of Sterling Pulp
Chemicals (1200 Smith, Suite 1900, Houston, TX 77002-4312; Tel:
713/650-3700, Fax: 713/650-9551). BFR is a unified package of
engineering systems that reorganize and redirect the flow of the
fluids used to bleach paper pulp. They trap process chemicals for
reclamation and reuse in the bleach plant; capture the non-fibrous
components of wood that are removed by bleaching and use them as
fuel in the pulp mill; and recycle the treated process water to the
pulp mill and the bleach plant. Champion says that BFR can reduce
the discharge of dissolved organic matter by about 90%, cut
discharges of chlorinated organic compounds to almost zero; and
virtually eliminate any color in effluent from the bleach plant.

Champion has licensed the HPD Division of Wheelabrator Water
Technologies to market BFR worldwide, and Champion and Sterling
have established The Closed Loop Alliance (10 Pearl St., Kingston,
NY 12401; Tel: 914/331-1431) to promote awareness of BFR and their
goal of making kraft mills environmentally friendly by closing the
loop on their waste streams.

Tailoring to Meet
Application Specs

Stephen J. Allen (Dept. of Chemical Engineering, Queen's University
of Belfast, Stranmillis Rd, Belfast BT9 5AH, U.K.) foresees a
demand for activated carbons which are prepared for specific
applications in water and wastewater treatment. He reports that
technology now in development will be able to produce carbons with
precisely engineered surface properties and pore sizes. Lignite, in
particular, is a source material that is suitable for activation in
different ways to produce absorption characteristics for specific
purposes.

Allen and a team of four U.S. and British engineers compared the
differences in absorption of sodium benzoate, 2,4-dichlorophenol,
and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol on five activated carbons made from the
same Crumlin lignite. They activated the lignite in a two-stage
experimental process with iron sulfate and steam at 800(C, zinc
chloride with steam at 600( and 800(C, and iron nitrate with steam
at 600( and 800(C.

Allen reports in Journal of Chemical Technology & Biotechnology
[64, 261-268, 1995] that chemical and steam activation each
improved the performance of activated carbons from Crumlin lignite,
and the two-stage combination gave the best results. The chemical
treatments that gave the best results on their own, iron nitrate
and zinc chloride at 800(C, also gave the best results when
combined with steam treatment.

These two carbons showed the poorest agreement with traditional
absorption theories. Allen suggests that this is because capillary
condensation accounts for significant extra absorption that is not
accounted for by models based on surface absorption. Allen's team
found a good correlation between surface area measured by nitrogen
absorption and the capacity of the carbons for absorbing benzoic
acid. The monolayer benzoic acid capacity also correlated well with
total absorptive capacity, showing that the dominant mechanism is
more likely to be pure absorption than capillary condensation.

Membrane Reactor
Purges Dissolved O2

Dissolved oxygen is usually purged from ultrapure water by thermal
degassing, vacuum degassing, nitrogen bubble deaeration, or the
addition of hydrazine or sodium sulfite. Engineers in Singapore
have invented a bench-scale membrane reactor that overcomes the
disadvantages of these physical and chemical methods in reducing
dissolved oxygen to less than 1.5 ppb.

K. Li, Ivy Chua, W.J. Ng, and W.K. Teo (Dept. of Chemical
Engineering, National University of Singapore, 10 Kent Ridge
Crescent, Singapore 0511) used a membrane reactor made from a
microporous polypropylene hollow fiber module packed with a
catalyst in the void space. They investigated the simultaneous
operation of both physical and chemical processes in purging the
water of oxygen.

The  membranes are hydrophobic with 0.04 cm OD, 0.003 cm wall
thickness, and 30 nm pores covering 33% of the hollow fiber
surface. The catalysts are beads of palladium-doped anion exchange
resins based on styrene and divinyl benzene. Li reports that the
engineers introduced purified hydrogen into the fiber lumens while
they fed deionized water saturated with air to about 8.3 ppm DO
into the shell side where it flowed through the catalyst packed
around the fibers. Dissolved oxygen (DO) diffuses from the water
through the hollow fibers to be purged by hydrogen. At the time,
hydrogen diffuses through the fibers into the water and reacts with
any remaining oxygen to form water.

The authors measured oxygen concentration in the gas phase with a
Perkin Elmer gas chromatograph using a thermal conductivity
detector and recorded the detector response on a PC with Perkin
Elmer software. They used an Orbisphere Model 3600 dissolved gas
analyzer to monitor dissolved oxygen in the feed and effluent
streams.

Li writes in Chemical Engineering Science [50-22, 3547-3556, 1995]
that the rate of dissolved oxygen removal by both physical and
chemical processes was controlled by the liquid film around the
hollow fiber membranes and catalyst particles in the shell side. At
low catalyst loadings, both physical and chemical processes
contributed to oxygen removal whereas at high catalyst loadings the
chemical reaction was dominant.

It was found that mass transfer studies show that the mass transfer
coefficient for physical stripping is generally smaller than the
coefficient for the chemical reaction. Both coefficients are
dependent on the rate of water flow through the reactor. The group
developed a mass transfer correlation which they expect to be
useful in designing a full-scale membrane reactor that will achieve
a DO level of 1.2 ppb.

U.S. Filter Is
Dealing Again

U.S. Filter Corp. (73-710 Fred Waring Dr., Palm Desert, CA 92260;
Tel: 619/340-0098, Fax: 619/341-9368) continues its acquiring ways.
This time it is Jet Tech Inc. (Edwardsville, KS) and Continental
Water Systems Northwest (Auburn, WA). You have to ask, "Is FilmTec
next?"

Jet Tech manufactures high efficiency air diffusion equipment which
accelerate the destruction of organic contaminants in sequencing
batch reactors and autothermal thermophilic aerobic digesters which
treat sludge and solids for land applications or unrestricted
landfilling.

Continental Northwest supplies water treatment products and
services for high purity industrial water systems for the
electronics industry and operates a facility in Vancouver for
regenerating ion exchange resins. U.S. Filter plans to merge
Continental Northwest with its recently acquired Polymetrics
operations in Seattle.

U.S. Filter has inaugurated its US$6 million wastewater treatment
plant for the city of Yautepec in the Mexican state of Morelos.
Officials from the U.S. and Mexico gathered in Morelos to mark the
completion of the plant one year after the devaluation of the
Mexican peso. U.S. Filter designed, built, and operates the plant
under a direct concession agreement. It will treat 5.6 mgd of raw
sewage for the city of 48,000 people. Richard J. Heckman of U.S.
Filter says the Yautepec project is the company's third in Mexico
since the passage of NAFTA. U.S. Filter has also invested $1
million in its pharmaceutical, laboratory, and dialysis water
center in Mexico City.

European Bank
Offers Loans

The European Investment Bank is loaning ECU 70 million, about $92
million, to Aguas Argentina to finance the construction of new
sewer and wastewater treatment facilities for the northern part of
Buenos Aires. Aguas Argentina is a joint venture of Lyonnaise des
Eaux, S.G. de Barcelona, Compagnie Generale des Eaux, Sociedad
Comercial de la Plata, Meller S.A., and Banco de Galicia y Buenos
Aires. The project is part of a $4 billion program to extend
wastewater treatment services to 3.5 million people in parts of
Buenos Aires without adequate sewer services.

The European Investment Bank has been the long-term financing
agency of the European Union since 1958, and it finances capital
investments in countries which have cooperation agreements with the
union.

The Humanitarian Office of the European Community (ECHO) is backing
international reconstruction efforts in Haiti by granting ECU 5
million, about $6.5 million, in aid for 20 projects which include
developing supplies of safe drinking water for urban and rural
areas. This is the third phase of an aid program that ECHO began in
June 1995.

The Cohesion Fund of the European has granted ECU 117.7 million,
about $153 million, to help Greece in seven water-related projects.
They include a water pipeline system from the rivers Aliakmon and
Axios to Thessaloniki, enlarging and completing wastewater
treatment facilities at Thessaloniki, reinforcing of the Mornos
aqueduct, and biological water treatment and sewage treatment
stations at Agrino, Thiva, Pyrgos, and Yannitsa.

French and Chinese officials have signed a 30-year, $200 million
loan agreement to finance four projects in China that use French
equipment. The projects include water treatment facilities for
rural areas and municipal wastewater treatment facilities for the
city of Xiamen in southeast China. Yves Galland, the French
Minister for Foreign Trade, signed the agreement in Beijing on
December 4. France has granted similar low-interest loans totaling
$2.4 billion in the last decade.

The North American Development Bank has approved its first two
loans for environmental projects. Alfredo Phillips Olmedo of NADB
reports that NADBank directors have authorized funding for a $14.5
million  wastewater treatment plant in Ensenada, Baja California
and a $25.4 million fresh water system for Brawley, CS. The
binational bank created under NAFTA to support infrastructure
development will underwrite $6.45 million of the Ensenada project
which replaces an obsolete facility. NADBank will fund $17.2
million of the Brawley loan where the present water treatment plant
fails drinking water standards.

Life Industries Wins
Mexican Concession

Life Industries, Inc. (219 Orange Ave., Sarasota, FL 34236; Tel:
941/361-2106, Fax: 941/361-2127) has won a 15-year concession to
design and build 6 municipal wastewater treatment plants for six
cities in the Mexican state of Morelos. George L. Hagen of Life
Industries (Tel: 813/351-8617, Fax: 813/351-2004) says that the
company is acting in partnership with the firm ICA S.A. de C.V. of
Guadalajara. The concession includes management and maintenance of
the plants. Hagen expects the concession to generate income
totaling $30 million.

Life Industries owns two artesian water wells that supply drinking
water for an area near Guadalajara. The firm has plans to build a
plant to treat and bottle the water for local and international
sales. Life Industries proposes to use a process invented by Deiter
Gabor and covered by U.S. Patents 5,292,194 and 5,342,529. It
consists of a chamber which is under pressure at one end and a
vacuum at the other.  A high-speed rotor draws feedwater into the
high pressure end where centrifugal force spins out the impurities.
The water is treated by vacuum distillation and withdrawn at the
vacuum end. Hagen says the product water is highly pure in quality.

French Do Adore
the British Water

The European Commission has approved a takeover bid from Lyonnaise
des Eaux for the Northumbrian Water Group which supplies drinking
water and sewage treatment services in the northeast of England.
Lyonnaise already owns two other British water utilities, North
East Water and Suffolk Water. Ian Byatt, regulator of British
utilities, insisted on price cuts of 15% over the next 6 years when
Lyonnaise offered $1.27 billion for Northumbrian.

Another French takeover bid is taking shape in southeast England,
where Generale des Eaux and SAUR Water Services Plc have joined in
a buyout offer for Mid Kent Holdings Plc. The two French companies
already own 39% of Mid Kent, and they say they plan to split the
firm and merge it into two other companies that they already own.
General des Eaux and SAUR own nine other British water utilities,
and they say the merger would ease water shortages and improve
efficiency of service. They did not propose any reductions in water
rates. Mid Kent management has rejected the French bid as
unwelcome.

A third British utility is looking to international growth to
assure its future. Thames Water Plc has a 35% share in a $860
million project to supply drinking water to the Turkish city of
Izmit. Thames is the largest investor in the group which has the
concession for the "build, operate, and transfer" project.

Bone Charcoal, Sand
Clear the Water

Twenty small springs in northeast England are sources of ground
water that is strongly colored by fulvic and humic acids.
Chlorination results in the formation of trihalomethanes at levels
well above the standard allowed by the European Community. J. Lewis
(Yorkshire Water plc., U.K.) reports that engineers at Yorkshire
Water had little success at treating the colored water with
advanced technologies. They have now devised a method of using bone
charcoal in combination with slow sand filters.

Lewis explains that bone charcoal upgrades sand filtration by
removing turbidity and absorbing color and metals. Activated carbon
is not as good at absorbing metals. The Marsett pilot plant uses a
commercial bone char material, Brimac, which is more commonly used
in sugar refining. Brimac consists of 10% activated carbon and 90%
hydroxyapatite in a 20/60 mesh size, and it has a structure which
protects it from rapid erosion. The 8 m3/day pilot plant has 3
covered slow sand filters followed by chlorination and storage in
a service reservoir.

Lewis reports in Water & Environmental Management [9-4, 385-395,
1995] on the first six months of monitoring the Marsett pilot
plant. Lewis found that pH was initially 11 but stabilized below
nine within six weeks. The color of the filtered water and THM
levels were consistently much lower than the EC standards. Bone
charcoal was consistently better than sand in removing turbidity
and coliforms, but the level of dissolved metals in the groundwater
was too low to make any comparison.

The success of the Marsett pilot plant convinced Yorkshire Water to
convert five other small treatment works to bone charcoal
filtration. Two have dual-media filters with bone char on sand, and
the others have layers of bone char between sand. Their capacity
ranges from 3-100 m3/day. The thickness of bone char in most cases
is 500 mm. All treated colored water, turbidity, and THMs
effectively, though spikes as high as 20 Hazen units mark momentary
breakthroughs during exceptional rains at the Marsett plant. One
plant reduced Al levels from 0.4 mg/l to less than 0.05 mg/l, and
two reduced Fe levels from as much as 0.7 mg/l to <0.05-0.1 mg/l.

Although bone char costs 35 times more than sand, Lewis found that
it actually produced real savings in labor costs because bone
charcoal filters are easier to clean than sand and the bone
char/sand filtration requires less labor at a small plant than a
more complex technology. Bone char filters reduce chlorination
costs by as much as 70%.

Can Structured
Water Be Good

A new product for the gullible health faddists is "Aqua Resonance
AM" from Quorum International Ltd., a network marketing firm that
also markets Quorum water filtration and Genesis distillation
systems and Biologics nutrition products over the Internet with a
home page listing at http://www.hk.super.net/~gng/aqua.html.

Capitalizing on the peculiar properties of water proceeding from
its polar structure and invoking the perennial appeal of the
fountain of youth, its distributors say that "Aqua Resonance AM" is
water that has been clustered "to improve metabolic efficiency and
nutrient absorption back into the cells of the human body."

Using "sophisticated magnetic resonance, laser and ceramic
technology, Dr. Lorenzen has succeeded in producing micro-clustered
water with the same properties of youthful biowater." It is
Lorenzen's thesis that cellular water is not like tap water, rain
water, or mineral water because its molecules share hydrogen atoms
and cluster in small bunches, delivering nutrients and removing
toxins as they diffuse through cell walls.

The movement of cellular water supposedly slows down as we age and
no longer performs its metabolic functions as well. Claiming that
"the study of cellular signal transduction has for years pointed to
the need for replacement of biowater as we age," the distributors
of Aqua Resonance AM recommend adding one capful to a 0.75 l bottle
of distilled water, shaking well, and refrigerating for 8 hours
before drinking.

Aqua Resonance is, of course, 100% pure water and so concentrated
that a devotee needs only 2 tablespoons per gallon of distilled
water to prepare the most effective mixture. It is available in 4-
oz bottles at $34.95 per bottle plus postage and handling from
Aqualogics (Tel: 602/780-5588 or email: Gilbert Ng at

Daicel Increases
It's Production

According to a report in Separation Membrane Business News in Japan
(November 1995), published by CHC Corp. (27-4-205 Koshienguchi
Kita-machi, Nishinomiya 663, Japan), Daicel (1-Teppo-Cho, Sakai,
Osaka Prefecture, 590 Japan) will increase its hollow fiber
membrane production capacity from 2,000 bundles a year to 20,000
bundles by 1997.  Daicel has marketed Molsep (RO and UF membrane)
and Pearlcon since 1975 in its separation systems division.  Those
materials are applied to preparation of ultrapure water,
concentration and clarification of fruit juice, and separation and
purification of enzymes and pharmaceuticals.  Four new production
lines for hollow fiber membrane will be located in the Himeji
Plant.

Daicel underwent a reorganization last year, and established a new
company, Daicen, in cooperation with Central Filter to carry out
marketing and maintenance of membrane modules and membrane systems.
Daicel continues to produce the membrane in a pilot plant in their
research center.

The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has asked
major water system engineering companies to investigate the use of
novel technology for recycling wastewater.  The technologies
developed are expected to be composites of various operations
including reverse osmosis, biological treatment, ammonia
adsorption, activated carbon adsorption, and oxidation.  The
government will provide a process development budget for the next
3-4 years, subject to approval by the Ministry of Finance.

Countertop System
from Premier

Researchers at Premier Manufactured Systems, Inc. (17431 N. 25th
Ave., Phoenix, AZ 85023; Tel: 602/931-1977) have developed a
countertop reverse osmosis (RO) unit utilizing a membrane that
permits operation at abnormally low water pressures, typically as
low as 10 psi (U.S. Patent 5,445,729). Tap water pressure at the
faucet typically is less than 40 psi.

The RO unit makes do with only one, small and compact, outlet pump.
An optional single, or a dual-channel dual-pass, ultraviolet (UV)
light source sterilizes filtered inlet, and/or the purified output.
Purified water is stored at atmospheric pressure in a simple
storage bag, and is dispensed on demand by force of the outlet
pump.

The entire RO unit-storage bag, pump, filters, UV sterilizer,
membrane and all-is packaged in a compact and aesthetically
pleasing, cylindrically-shaped housing. The unit can be kept on a
household counter top with flow connected to normal household
plumbing-typically to the faucet and drain of a kitchen sink-while
connected to normal household power.

The RO unit is intended for purification of water in the event of
an emergency or power emergency, and is even operative in the
complete absence of electrical power, such as after an earthquake
or other emergency, by manual disconnection or bypass of its inlet
solenoid valve.

Profit Margins
Can Be Slim

Certainly automation and improved fabrication techniques help, but
the profit margins for RO have got to be the slimmest of any of the
membrane technologies. Back when RO membranes/modules were selling
for $7 - $10/sq. ft., that was considered cheap compared to an
ultrafiltration membrane.  Now we hear about some of the home RO
manufacturers talking about $2.50/sq. ft. for simple flat sheet
membrane.  Those big 8" X 40" modules that we grew up with were
usually in the $1000-$1500 range. Now we hear about 8" X 40"
modules going for as little as $550.  Of course that may "depend"
on a lot of different things, but price cutting seems to be the
norm.

There are about 2,200 million gallons per day of installed RO
capacity worldwide.  Most of this capacity is for brackish feeds.
About 14% of installed capacity is in sea water RO.  Life cycles
for general RO modules have been extended from the 1-3 year time
span of the 1980s to the 3.5-4.5 year time span in 1995. Sea water
RO installations seem to add modules on a continual and on-going
basis to keep water quality up. The replacement market remains
about 53% of the global sales of membranes and modules or about
$100 million worldwide annually out of a total market of $189
million.

A lot of ownership changes have taken place in the past few years
and probably a lot more are in the making.  There seems to be a
diversity of players and some of the leaders such as FilmTec/Dow
may be seeing their market share declining. Dow probably had over
37% of the world's RO market in 1992. Finishing out 1995, Dow
probably has more like 24-25% of the global RO market.

U.S. companies once saw an unrivaled dominance for their RO
technology.  Interesting that as the profit margins shrink, the
U.S. companies seem to be gathering up competitors to share in the
$189 million membrane/module global RO market. (see table)

SLANTS & TRENDS
***************


EMERGING MARKETS: Although political and economic
instability continues to plague many Central and Eastern
European countries, interest in the environmental goods and
services markets there continues. Initially off to a
somewhat rocky start, many states, especially such Eastern
European countries as the Czech and Slovak Republics,
Hungary and Poland, are adopting Western-style environmental
regulations. Further, privatization of state-held industries
has put environmental concerns in the hands of individuals
rather than often unaccountable bureaucracies. Still,
creating a sustainable development ethic is difficult amid
hard economic times, analysts say. And without adequate
state funding or enforcement of existing environmental laws
and regulations, the pace of remediation and pollution
abatement programs has been slow.

     This issue of WER looks at several facets of
environmental protection in Central and Eastern Europe,
particularly the problems faced by Russia and its nuclear
power industry. Because of the inherent safety problems
posed by radioactive materials, this sector requires
specialized environmental engineers and relatively high
costs, often beyond the reach of the former Second World's
developing economies.

* * *

CHINA TARGETED: While the West focuses much attention on
Central and Eastern Europe, funds also are flowing to
Communist China, where rapid industrialization and
population growth continues to plague the environment. The
European Investment Bank just issued its first loan to China
for environmentally friendly development of clean-burning
natural gas reserves. The project will help the environment
through the distribution of natural gas in Pudong, a
satellite city of Shanghai, which will reduce the air
pollution caused  by the present use of coal and town gas.
The EIB is providing roughly $73 million for the development
of the Ping Hu offshore field. The $1 billion project is
being co-financed by the Asian Development Bank, the Exim
Bank of Japan and France.


Central/Eastern European News Briefs

     Events creating possibilities for sales of
environmental goods and services in Central and Eastern Eu-
rope are routine occurrences. The following is a snapshot of
environmental news stories that occurred just before or
after the New Year.

Russia Having Trouble With CFCs

     Russia is asking for more time to cut ozone-threatening
substances. At a major international conference of
government representatives convened in Vienna to review the
1987 Montreal Protocol on ozone protection, Russian
Federation Environment Minister Viktor Danilov-Danilyan said
Russia needs more time and a larger pool of investment aid
in order to develop substitutes to ozone-harming substances
such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Under the Montreal
Protocol, signed by 150 countries, such industrialized
countries as Russia are to stop producing CFCs by 1996 and
the rest of the signatories by 2010.

     Minister Danilov-Danilyan said the Russian Federation
is now producing only half the ozone-threatening chemicals
it was in 1987, but he added that the drop was a by-product
of the fall in industrial output. The minister was quick to
point out that he and his government would have preferred to
be able to meet the deadline, as other governments are
doing, but that the economic conditions prevailing within
his country are making it impossible for the principal
factories from even paying their workers, let alone their
taxes and electric bills. It will be impossible for the
Russian government to force such enterprises, even if they
are state-owned (and many are not) to comply with the
protocol when the ministry has no financial capacity to
support the enterprise's change-over to non-CFC production
or usage.

German, Swiss, Finnish Waste

     Germany and Switzerland have decided not to send spent
nuclear fuel to Krasnoyarsk-26 for processing, Krasnoyarsk
Krai Deputy Governor Sergei Arinchin was quoted as saying.
The waste would have been processed at the RT-2 plant -
still under construction - in the formerly secret nuclear
center in Siberia. The Russian authorities had hoped to
finance the project by accepting foreign waste, enabling
them to process their own stocks. The Swiss and German
pullout will deal a major blow to the project. The decision
is likely to be hailed by environmental groups, which have
strongly opposed the importation of nuclear materials,
arguing that Russia's waste storage sites are already
overflowing.

     Meanwhile, a trainload of spent nuclear fuel from a
Finnish nuclear power plant reportedly has arrived in Russia
for processing at the Mayak plant in Chelyabinsk-65. An
English translation of the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper
says it is not yet clear whether the nuclear residue remain-
ing after processing will be shipped back to Finland or kept
inside the Russian Federation.

Nuclear Safety Threatened

     Nuclear safety may be threatened by workers at Russia's
nuclear power plants, who say they may shut down the
facilities unless they receive overdue wage payments.
Officials say they have scheduled warning protests, but it
is not clear what form they will take. Energy consumers owe
nuclear power plants about 2.5 trillion rubles (US$555
million), and on average workers have not been paid for
three months, according to the deputy head of Rosenergoatom
in Moscow.

Assistance from Germany

     A German company has signed a contract with Russia's
Kursk nuclear power plant to construct a nuclear waste
storage facility and to provide 240 containers to store the
plant's radioactive waste. The German Company for Nuclear
Containers, a Nukem subsidiary, will control production
quality, train specialists and provide the know-how for
production. According to Gosatomnadzor, Russia's nuclear
safety agency, the solid waste storage facilities at the
Kursk plant are full.

Kazakhstan Troubled

     The amount of radioactive waste accumulating at uranium
mining and processing plants in Kazakhstan reportedly is
reaching alarming proportions. Since this large, very poor
Central Asian country became independent in 1991, the
quantity of radioactive waste stored in Kazakhstan has grown
to 219 million metric tons. The republic's Ministry of
Ecology and Biological Resources claims the aggregate
radioactivity from the waste comes to 250,000 curies, which
is "many times more than the accepted norm." Kazakhstan does
not have the means to deal with the waste because under the
Soviet Union's regime disposal was a national responsibility
carried out by the government in Moscow. Today, there are
neither any Kazakh laws nor bilateral agreements with Russia
which adequately address this type of nuclear waste disposal
dilemma.

ARTHUR D. LITTLE IS AWARDED $7.6 MILLION
TO HELP BELARUS TACKLE DEFENSE WASTE


     The international consulting firm Arthur D. Little has
been awarded a $7.6 million contract to help the former
Soviet republic of Belarus solve environmental problems
related to its former Strategic Rocket Forces (SRF) bases.

     The two-and-a-half-year contract from the Defense
Nuclear Agency (DNA) is part of the Cooperative Threat
Reduction (CTR) Program developed under the l991 Nunn-Lugar
legislation intended to assist the countries of the former
Soviet Union in the elimination, and to prevent the
proliferation, of weapons of mass destruction.

     Arthur D. Little experts will help Belarus personnel to
assess the radiation and conventional environmental damage
at sites where intercontinental ballistic missiles were
based, transported, operated, or maintained, and help the
country restore them for other purposes. In Belarus alone,
at the height of the arms race, there were more than 80 SS-
25 missiles. Belarus has since declared itself a non-nuclear
state and wishes to return the facilities to civilian use.

     Arthur D. Little consultants will integrate a number of
different technical resources within the program to provide
training and technical assistance to the Belarus officials
and experts. The consultants will work with the Belarus
personnel to analyze the environmental problems at one
missile site and devise a restoration plan, then oversee the
Belarus technicians as they do environmental restoration
work at a second site. The ultimate goal is to transfer
enough knowledge to Belarus so that they can complete the
environmental restoration work at the remaining sites.

     Potential environmental problems include heavy metal
and low-level radioactive contaminants, spilled petroleum,
spilled liquid rocket fuel, and some minefields around the
sites' perimeters which have unexploded ordnances.

     As part of the effort to transfer expertise in the
environmental restoration field, Arthur D. Little will
conduct international conferences co-sponsored by DNA and
the Belarus Ministry of Defense. Experts from around the
world will be invited to Belarus to discuss a variety of
environmental restoration experiences, technologies, and
management issues.

     As part of the CTR program, an agreement was signed in
l993 between the United States and the Republic of Belarus
to assist in development of the Environmental Restoration
Project. Other CTR projects in Belarus under Nunn-Lugar
include assistance in defense conversion, export control
systems and training, government-to-government
communications links, and emergency response equipment and
training.

     Belarus, located between Poland and Russia, has an
especially high water table and active groundwater movement,
which can exacerbate groundwater pollution.

     Other organizations involved with Arthur D. Little on
the Environmental Restoration Project include the Army Corps
of Engineers Waterways Experiment Station, Los Alamos
Technical Associates, Technology Management Company, the
Environmental Chemical Corp., the Environmental Hazards
Specialists International, Environmental Careers
Organizations, the World Environment Center, and Clean
Sites, Inc.

     Arthur D. Little, which conducted the largest
environmental impact assessment ever conducted in the Former
Soviet Union by a Western company, has handled more than
3,000 environmental audits and assessments in 30 countries
throughout Europe and the United States. Headquartered in
Cambridge, MA., Arthur D. Little has offices around the
world. It provides consulting in three areas: environmental,
health, and safety consulting; management consulting; and
technology and product development.

     RUSSIAN NUCLEAR SAFETY: Viktor Mikhailov, Russia's
minister of nuclear energy, announced Jan. 2 that nuclear
smuggling should be the top item on the agenda for the April
G-7 summit in Moscow. Mikhailov said the summit, devoted to
nuclear safety issues, should draft "common procedures" for
dealing with nuclear smuggling and tightening control over
nuclear materials. He also announced his ministry made $1.65
billion from exports in 1995, a significant contribution to
Russia's $63 billion in total exports, and not much less
than the $2.5 billion Russia earned by exporting arms.
However, many of the countries that want to purchase Russian
civilian nuclear technology, such as Iran and Cuba, have a
questionable ability to pay for it, casting doubt on
Mikhailov's prediction that nuclear exports can be boosted
to $2 billion by 1998.

RUSSIAN ENVIRONMENT MARKET
TO BE SUBJECT OF NEW STUDY


     Arthur D. Little has undertaken a study of the Russian
market for environmental equipment and services to help U.S.
companies determine export potential as that area of the
world rebuilds its economy.

     The study, requested by the U.S. Department of Commerce
and the American Embassy in Moscow, will determine the
potential for U.S. environmental goods and services in
Russia, indicate current and future trends, and highlight
the dominant driving forces and pressing environmental
concerns in the Russian market.

     The information will be used to help U.S. companies
decide whether and how to compete in the Russian
environmental services market, and help lay the groundwork
for U.S. government-sponsored trade promotion events.

Many Subjects Targeted

     Special areas Arthur D. Little consultants will explore
include the most pressing environmental needs in air, water,
and solid waste pollution control and prevention, and the
barriers that could restrict access to the Russian market by
U.S. environmental services firms.

     U.S. firms have indicated a growing interest in the
potential for environmental goods and services sales in
Russia as more public and private money is invested in
rebuilding the economy.

Services being assessed include:

     l Solid and hazardous waste management;
     l Waste site cleanup or construction;
     l Pollution abatement in such areas as asbestos, lead,
and radon; and
     l Environmental consulting and engineering in hazardous
waste, air and water quality, pollution prevention, and
environmental management.
     Equipment markets include:
     l Air, water, and solid waste pollution controls;
     l Environmental monitoring systems;
     l Waste containment, disposal and treatment tech-
nologies;
     l Thermal technologies;
     l Bulk liquid removal; and
     l Groundwater collection.

     Anthony Montrone, vice president in charge of Arthur D.
Little's environmental business strategy practice, and David
Webb, director of the firm's Moscow office, said Arthur D.
Little was chosen because of its long history of helping
companies enter international environmental products and
services markets, and its experience addressing
environmental issues in Russia.

UKRAINE RESEARCH FACILITY BOASTS
ADVANCED REMEDIATION TECHNOLOGY


     Ukraine has recently produced two technologies that may
significantly facilitate remediation of industrial waste
waters as well as the recycling of used oil and such
composite wastes as grinding swarf and certain sludges.

     Marketing of the technologies is being handled through
the Struten Institute, which promotes access to these and
other technology-transfer opportunities.

     One Ukrainian research institute has developed methods
to produce a semipermeable membrane made of synthetic
diamond, the Struten Institute says. The material may be
placed on a variety of substrates, including ceramics.

     The result is a semipermeable membrane that is
simultaneously resistant to heat, abrasion and pressure.

     In a separate yet linked development, another Ukrainian
institute has perfected a method for "scrubbing" the surface
of semipermeable membranes. From a physical chemistry stand-
point, it is now possible to continually and economically
stir-up otherwise sedate layers.

     The method has so far been applied to polymeric
membranes, speeding reverse osmosis pressures as low as 2-5
atmospheres, the Student Institute says.

     The Struten Institute is a nonprofit organization based
in the United States and geared toward bringing technically
trained individuals from Ukraine in contact with Western
companies.

     "This business level, technical contact, mediated
through the Struten Institute, is a dividend some businesses
will realize from the fall of communism," the institute said
in a statement.

     Differentiating between Ukraine and the Russian
Federation, the Struten Institute says it is keen to help
companies economically secure research and development
partners and tap Ukraine's emerging market of 52 million
people.

EUROPEAN UNION MOVES TO TIGHTEN
ENVIRONMENTAL RULES ON PROJECTS


     European Union environment ministers have reached a
political agreement to extend the range of development
projects requiring environmental impact assessments (EIAs)
before final approval is granted. Meeting in Brussels in
late December, the ministers endorsed proposal COM(93)575,
which expands the EIA requirements under directive
85/337/EEC.

     The move, termed a decade too late, was hailed by many
in the environment industry for opening the door to new
goods and services sales. The revised rules will come into
effect in January 1998, but only after parliamentary
approval.

     Spanish Transport and Public Works Minister Jose
Borrell, who chaired the meeting as EU environment
president, said the union now has a complete series of rules
on which investment projects require EIAs. In recent years,
EIAs largely have been conducted on an ad hoc basis, have at
times been poor in quality, and recommendations from
stakeholders sometimes have not been followed, EU sources
say.

     Under the new regime, the EIAs will more accurately
identify potential environmental problems associated with
proposed development projects and give stakeholders,
including developers, authorities and the public, ample
opportunity to discuss them, the ministers said in a
concluding statement. Projects plagued by poor EIA
implementation include Britain's Twyford Down transportation
project and Greece's plan to divert the Acheloos River.

     The new rules extend mandatory EIAs to such sectors as
road-widening, nonhazardous waste storage facilities, water
wells and management, oil and gas drilling, petroleum
pipelines, dams, intensive hog and poultry farming, pulp and
paper factories, open mines and  quarries, overhead power
lines, and chemical storage facilities exceeding 200,000
metric tons. EIAs may also be required, but will not be
mandatory, for forestry, mineral extraction, energy, metal
and chemical processing, food, textiles and  tourism
projects.

JAMAICA SEEKS UN FUNDING
FOR SEABED PROTECTION


     Kingston asked the United Nations Dec. 26 to restore
funds for the International Seabed Authority, a group that
would oversee economic activities in international waters.
One of the authority's main responsibilities will be to
supervise seabed mining. The move follows a U.N. decision to
cut 1996 funding from $2.6 million to $770,000. The ruling
also would eliminate several of the 17 proposed posts.

     Although the authority boasts 170 member countries,
participants have not been able to decide on who should sit
on the council or who should serve as the secretary general.
The authority will meet next in Kingston in March. Jamaica,

COMPANIES, REGULATORS AGREE
ON STRATEGY FOR NEW TESTS


     Multinational companies concerned about the cost of
assessing the environmental and health hazards posed by
their operations may benefit from a new set of toxicology
test strategies drafted last month. The new methods are
designed to save time and money, better predict health
effects of drugs, chemicals, radiation and other substances
and reduce, refine or replace animal use.

     The Interagency Coordination Committee on the
Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) has issued a
report viewed as important to the international environment
community because it should enhance global efforts to
harmonize toxicity testing methods. Countries are trying to
harmonize methods so health regulators around the world can
share data and make comparable risk assessments.
Corporations support the effort which would make it easier
to conduct tests accepted throughout the global economy.

     More than 150 people discussed a draft report by the
ICCVAM at a National Toxicology Program workshop held in
mid-December. ICCVAM represents 15 U.S. federal agencies
including National Institutes of Health, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Centers for
Disease Control, the Department of Energy, the Agency for
Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the Department of
Transportation.

     ICCVAM designed its report to apply to all proposed
toxicological testing methods for health and ecological
effects. New tests could supplement or be alternatives to
the traditional two-year rodent bioassay used in risk
assessments and regulatory decisionmaking. New tests could
involve transgenic animals, mathematical and computer
models, and in vitro methods, such as test tube or petri
dish experiments with tissue samples. The new methodologies
should help agencies better protect human health and safety,
said ICCVAM co-chair William Stokes.

     The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Devel-
opment (OECD), which represents 25 nations, approves
guidelines for new test methods. OECD-member nations must
accept data generated by tests that followed approved guide-
lines, said OECD representative Herman Koeter. OECD experts
will review ICCVAM's report Jan. 22-24 at a workshop on
alternative test methods.

     ICCVAM's report describes eight criteria agencies would
use to assess a proposed test method's validity. For
example, researchers or manufacturers should test the new
procedure on agents similar to the substances to which the
method would be applied. The researchers also should give
agencies a detailed protocol describing the method,
materials needed, criteria by which data will be evaluated
and the procedure's limitations. The protocol should be
reviewed by an independent scientific panel.

     Agencies should consider more than a dozen criteria in
determining whether they should accept a new test method,
ICCVAM said. For example, the new procedure should: be
approved by the scientific community; adequately predict the
endpoint of interest; be readily transferred among
laboratories; and generate data that is as good or better
for hazard identification and/or dose-response assessment
than the test for which it is proposed to be a substitute.

     "The report is excellent," said David Brusick, echoing
comments expressed by many participants. Brusick, Corning
Hazleton's scientific director, co-chaired one of three
panels making recommendations for the report. He suggested
ICCVAM define a formal validation process and highlight it
and other key recommendations in tables and flow charts.

     Companies, agency scientists and other stakeholders
should be involved early on and throughout the process of
validating and accepting new methods, said Patricia
Williams, vice president of Glycomed, a biopharmaceutical
company. Risk assessors also must be involved to help ensure
data will meet their needs.

     Lawmakers and/or private industry should fund ICCVAM or
a similar committee to educate regulators about new test
methods, coordinate agencies' actions, and work with the
international community, several speakers said. Since
industry will benefit if these tests are accepted, companies
should consider funding, through a user fee, efforts to
approve the tests, said Steve Niemi, vice president of the
Genzyme Transgenics Corp.

Harmonizing testing methods may save firms millions of
dollars annually, Senior Scientist David Neuman, of the Ilsi
Risk Science Institute later said. Currently, to satisfy
divergent requirements, companies may conduct several
expensive tests that vary in only minor details. Duplicating
tests does little to help researchers or regulators
understand the substance being studied, he said. ICCVAM
expects to issue a final report this summer. Contact: Alma

UNEP VOICES SUPPORT FOR METHODS
THAT ENSURE GREATER DIVERSITY


     Local, regional and global initiatives to preserve
biodiversity were lauded Dec. 29 by world leaders
celebrating the International Day for Biological Diversity.

     In addition to touting the virtues of biodiversity,
leaders said companies looking to market their pollution
abatement and remediation goods and services will benefit
from helping improve public awareness of environmental
problems.

     Summarizing the day's theme was a statement by the
United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), which said
biological diversity constitutes the resource upon which
families, communities, nations and future generations
depend.

     (The Convention on Biological Diversity went into
effect Dec. 29, 1993. The document was signed by 167
countries plus the European Union on June 5 1992 and has to
date been ratified by 136 states.)

     Describing all living creatures as having its place and
function, the UNEP believes that through thoughtless action,
mankind is eroding the Earth's biological capital at an
alarming rate.

     "The world is being impoverished by the loss of its
richest resources - of forests, wetlands and seas and
depletion of its most fundamental stock - its species, its
ecosystems and its habitats," said UNEP Executive Director
Elizabeth Dowdeswell. Further, the loss of every gene,
species or ecosystem means a loss of an available adaptive
option.

     Although many countries and industry sectors take for
granted the Earth's natural bounty and resilience, the
ability of natural systems to bounce back after disruption
is declining. "If the environment is reaching the limits of
its endurance, what can each one of us do to conserve our
planet's biological capital?" the statement asks.

     An active and well-informed public is the best defence
for the environment, UNEP says. "An education that empowers
and enables people to seek collectively ways to overcome
current destructive trends is a critical component of any
successful strategy for achieving a sustainable future.

     Toward this ends, UNEP is eager to enlist the support
of indigenous conservation groups, whose indigenous
knowledge and wisdom about the environment may well provide
the resilience to adapt to the future environmental changes.
And, experience has shown that wherever local people have
been given greater responsibility for managing their own
resources, they have shown both a capacity and a willingness
to conserve.

     Sectors that should become more actively involved in
preserving biodiversity include the pharmaceutical industry,
agriculture, tourism, fisheries and industries requiring raw
materials.

     The United Nations Environment Program today works to
support the Convention on Biological Diversity by
strengthening the national and global base of knowledge on
biodiversity.

Industry Reaches Out

     The Paris-based Association Valentin Hauy has
translated the Convention on Biological Diversity into
braille and an initial print run of 1,000 English and 1,000
French copies were released Dec. 29. The version will be
distributed free of charge to organizations for blind and
partially sighted people around the world.

     The Spanish National Organization of the Blind (ONCE)
based in Madrid released 200 copies of the Spanish braille
version plus 200 copies on cassette. The event represents
the first time industry has joined forces with the
Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity to
financially support a braille project.

     Contributions were made by a number of international
partners including: the European Senior Advisory Group on
Biotechnology (SAGB), the US-based Biotechnology Industry
Organization, the Japan Bioindustry Association, the
Canadian Pulp and Paper Association and the European-based
Green Industry Biotechnology Platform. "These contributions
show industry's commitment to make available the content of
the convention to as many people as possible, thus sig-
nificantly contributing to increasing public awareness -
paramount in our drive to promote balanced economic and
social approaches for the protection of all life forms," the
secretariat said in a statement.

News Briefs

     l AIR POLLUTION - EUROPEAN UNION: The European
Commission plans to introduce two environmental initiatives
and to focus on member states' implementation of existing
environmental laws in 1996. The new initiatives will take on
industrial emissions of VOCs and the waste problems posed by
scrapped vehicles. Proposals to increase compliance with ex-
isting rules will include revisions to Directive 70/220 to
cut air pollution from "not privately owned" motor vehicles
and amendments to Directive 88/77 on pollution from diesel
emissions. Also pending are two initiatives for eco-labeling
of packaging and packaging waste.

     l CLIMATE - FINLAND: Pekka Kauppi of the Finnish Forest
Research Institute has concluded that the U.N. Framework
Convention on Climate Change's goal of stabilizing
greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels is an "unattainable"
goal. His warning follows a conclusion by international
scientists that humans are at least partially responsible
for climate change.

     l ENERGY - AUSTRALIA: Australian Energy Minister Tony
McGrady has announced 49 megawatts of electricity from
burning the sugar industry by-product bagasse will join the
Queensland power grid by Jan. 1, 1998. Mills in Invicta,
Kalamia, Inkerman, South Johnstone and Maryborough are
participating. The environmentally friendly technology may
be transferred to the thousands of sugar mills throughout
the world.

     l GROUNDWATER - INTERNET: The International Ground
Water Technology magazine can be reached via World Wide Web
at http://waternet.com. The company also operates electronic
mailing lists for paid subscribers to that publication and
another for subscribers to Water Technology magazine.
Contact: Publisher, e-mail: waternet@waternet.com.

     Also, a new mailing list named simply Groundwater has
been started. To subscribe, send e-mail to:
majordomo@ias.champlain.edu. In the body of the e-mail type
the command: subscribe groundwater. To send mail to the list
after you have subscribed, address the mail to: groundwa
ter@ias.champlain.edu. Kenneth Bannister is the list owner.

     l MANAGEMENT - INFORMATION: TG International Ltd. of
Ottawa, Canada, will conduct a free seminar on improving
corporate competitiveness through environmental management.
The seminar, A Mine From Hell: A Business Approach to
Environmental Management Issues, will be held Jan. 30 at the
Ottawa Public Library. The gathering will discuss the Crown
Butte Mines Inc.'s New World Mine in Montana. The Canadian
company Noranda Inc. owns controlling interest in the New
World Mine. Neither condemning or endorsing the mine, the
seminar will present a set of circumstances that will allow
participants to appraise and discuss a business management
approach to identifying stakeholders' concerns and
operational environmental issues, organizers say. Contact:

     l MARKETING - INTERNET: Companies looking for marketing
opportunities in the Eastern and Central Europe may be
interested in a new World Wide Web site established by the
Sacred Earth Network, a networking service among Western and
Eurasian Environmental nongovernmental organizations. The
site is located at http://www.igc.apc.org/sen/.
"Nongovernmental environmental organizations in the former
Soviet Union play an important role at home and abroad," the
organization said in announcing the site. "Their dedicated
professional and volunteer members strive to provide
reliable information about current conditions and the
effectiveness of remedial or conservation techniques. As
international collaboration grows, electronic mail has
become vital to the efficient development and implementation
of environmental programs." The site includes a directory of
e-mail users.

     l MEDICAL WASTE - AUSTRALIA: Too much waste is
considered infectious, drinking up hospital waste disposal
costs, according to the Australian Medical Association
(AMA). The contention was voiced during the Medwaste '95
conference sponsored by Griffith University. The AMA said
surveys show that 60 percent of what is put in hospital
infectious waste containers, including packaging and
flowers, is not infectious. With disposal of infectious
waste costing three times as much as general waste, the AMA
is concerned there is an over-zealous attitude toward
infectious waste. The AMA wants doctors to take the lead in
differentiating truly infectious from ordinary trash. In
Australia, hospitals only generated 0.5 kg of waste per
patient per day 15 years ago and now generate 15 kg. All
hospitals together produce  an  estimated  600,000 kg of
solid

waste daily. The buildup is partially due to the
introduction of single-use items, including medication cups
and oxygen masks.

     l POPULATION - WORLD: Because population growth and its
demand on natural resources is one of the leading causes of
environmental degradation, countries and international
institutions are looking for ways to integrate family
planning into long-range sustainable development goals. The
Population Institute revealed Dec. 28 that 4.7 billion of
the world's 5.7 billion residents, or 80 percent, live
outside the industrialized world. The population in
nonindustrialized countries will double in between 32 and 36
years, compared with 430 years for developed countries,
according to the institute's most recent report. In
aggregate, the world's population will double in 40 years.
This means that the vast majority of the 100 million new
mouths that will enter the world in 1996 will be found in
countries least able to meet the demand. As a result, the
fragile environment in these countries will suffer greatly,
the institute says. Particular problems include excess use
of firewood and overfarming of eroding lands.

     l PRODUCTS - INTERNET: Magnet Inc. of Seattle, Wash.,
has established a World Wide Web site, Better World, to
promote environmentally friendly products and information
for individuals and industry. The site, located at
http://www.betterworld.com, includes a wide range of
environmental information, including recycling and waste
minimization. Companies also can post online storefronts for
direct sales, product information, public relations
materials, and any other information they wish to convey to
potential customers. Contact: MagNet Inc. on the World Wide
Web at http://www.magnets.com or Barry Harrington
Associates, +1-510-376-4109; e-mail: barry.harrington@magnets.com.

     l RADIOACTIVE WASTE - ITALY: Italy will receive at
least 7,000 cubic meters of its own radioactive waste,
according to the National Agency for the Environment (ANPA).
The country had sent it for containment in England in the
late 1960's. Italy is way behind schedule in constructing
storage containers for the waste, said ANPA spokesperson
Renata Montesanti. Further, waste in England is the tip of
the iceberg, says the report, which recommends a creation of
a central government body and national standards to
coordinate radioactive waste management.

     l SOLAR ENERGY - ISRAEL: A plan to build a large solar
power facility in Israel is expected to draw a proposal from
Amoco-Enron Solar Power Development Co., in cooperation with
Israeli partners. A report from Israel said Amoco-Enron is
working with the Israeli companies Solel and Ormat Engines
on a proposal for a 100-megawatt solar facility for the
Israel Electric Corp. (IEC), but an official of the Houston-
based company declined to identify the firms involved. Rick
Barsky, senior vice president for development at Amoco-Enron
Solar Power Development, said he expects a request for
proposals for an 80-MW facility to be issued in the first
half of 1996. "We intend to look at that RFP and potentially
to respond to it," he said.

     l WASTE - GERMANY: There are at least 240,000 waste
sites suspected of polluting the German environment,
according to the International Trade Fair for Waste and
Waste Water Disposal. The Federal Environment Ministry said
earlier federal and state governments could provide DM24
billion to DM30 billion for clean-up in eastern lands by
2002. The German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin
said western Germany needs between 60 billion and DM100
billion for cleanups through 2005.

     l WATER POLLUTION - GERMANY: A treaty between the
German Chemical Manufacturers Association (VCI) and
Rotterdam in The Netherlands aims at reducing industrial
pollution of the Rhine River. The agreement affects about 50
VCI companies with sites along the Rhine. By 2000, they
promise to cut 1986 levels of zinc by 78 percent, mercury 77
percent, chromium 87 percent, copper 69 percent, nickel 64
percent, cadmium 58 percent, lead 57 percent and arsenic 2
percent. In return, Rotterdam, situated where the Rhine
enters the North Sea, will renounce until 2000 any damage
claims against VCI member companies for arsenic, cadmium,
chromium, mercury and nickel. The Port of Rotterdam is
sensitive to pollution of silt, which it must dredge con-
tinually.

PW, E&Y PLAN JERSEY MOVE TO LIMIT PARTNERS' LIABILITY

PRICE WATERHOUSE and Ernst & Young in the UK have announced plans to
change their legal status to limited liability partnerships (LLPs) and
to take their businesses off shore to Jersey.

The move is designed to protect partners' personal assets in the event
that a firm is successfully sued for negligence. Currently, like most
other UK accounting practices, the firms trade as unlimited liability
partnerships.

The move to LLP status, which cannot be done under UK law, would become
possible due to planned changes to Jersey law by the island's
government. In a statement issued on December 11, Jersey's
Parliamentary Finance and Economics Committee said it will propose a
bill to the island's Parliament permitting the creation of LLPs. The
government is keen to promote Jersey as an offshore financial services
centre.

Under the proposed law, the partnership would remain totally liable for
all the firm's debts, but individual partners who are not responsible
for a particular negligent act would have their personal assets
protected from debts arising from that negligence.

Each LLP would be required to have at least one general partner and all
LLP assets would be available to creditors. In addition, the LLP would
be required to provide a #5 million financial provision, a sort of
bond, for judgments against the partnership. The draft law will be
debated in Jersey's Parliament, the States of Jersey, during the first
quarter of 1996. If approved, it will then go to the Privy Council for
sanctioning and is expected to be operative by year-end.

"We are actively considering whether adoption of the limited liability
partnership structure is appropriate for the UK practice," said E&Y
senior partner Nick Land. "Initial consultation with a small number of
clients and all of our partners has produced a very positive reaction."

The firms' partnership culture would continue within the UK and there
would be no change to their UK taxation arrangements. The Jersey option
is claimed to be cheaper than the incorporation route chosen recently
by KPMG (TA 5902). A senior partner at one of the firms estimates the
saving could be as much as 10 percent of pre-tax profits compared with
the cost of KPMG's chosen route.

Accountants are not the only ones who stand to benefit from the new law
in Jersey. Other professionals, including solicitors, architects and
surveyors, will be able to establish partnerships on the island.
Practices in other countries could also relocate to Jersey.

"At the moment, if you are found to be liable for negligence then you
are liable for everything, no matter what one's contribution to that
negligence might have been," said Ian Brindle, senior partner at PW.

All the Big Six have been working with the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales to get the UK Government to change the
principle of joint and several liability contained in the Companies Act
of 1985. "This can't happen overnight," Brindle said. "These things
take time and time is not necessarily on our side." In the meantime,
the firms need a way to protect themselves from "Armageddon", he said.

Brindle described the UK's current limited liability law for
partnerships, which was created in 1907, as"not relevant to modern
times". Like joint and several liability, time-consuming primary
legislation would be needed to change it, he said.

NEW ORGANISATION CREATED AS CKL AND IAA MERGE

CKL INTERNATIONAL, the network that lost two of its founding members in
the space of a year, has agreed to merge with International Accounting
Associates (IAA) and its US affiliate, the Continental Association of
CPA Firms (CACPA).

The agreement was finalised in mid-November and takes effect on January
1. The merger is expected to create a network of 130 accounting and
consulting firms, with offices in 58 countries and annual revenues of
over $400 million (#260 million). Total staff is put at 6,700.

The new organisation will be known as AGN (Accountants Global Network)
International. Its board will be comprised of six representatives from
CKL and six from IAA-CACPA. CKL chief executive Nick Blake will remain
in that role at AGN.

The network will be divided into four regions: Asia/Pacific,
Europe/Africa/Middle East, Latin America and North America, where AGN
expects to have its strongest presence.

CKL has been in trouble since its UK firm and founding member Clark
Whitehill quit to join Horwath International (TA 5890) in September
1994. It eventually signed up the smaller firm Levy Gee as a
replacement (TA 5894).

Things got worse earlier this year when another founding member, US
firm Kenneth Leventhal, merged with Ernst & Young, taking with it
annual fees of $195 million (TA 5897). CKL firms in Belgium, Israel,
Greece and Denmark have also left within the last 18 months.

IAA, with headquarters in Engelwood, Colorado, had revenues of $193
million in 1994. CACPA, a group of 26 firms in the US, accounted for
about $150 million of that total.

Whether all of CKL's members will go along with the merger is still not
clear. South African firm Levitt Kirson is known to be considering a
move to Nexia International, although no decision had been made as TA
went to press.

UK:  COURT REJECTS NAMES' ACTION AGAINST LITTLEJOHN FRAZER

A #200 MILLION negligence suit brought by investors in the Lloyd's of
London insurance market against Littlejohn Frazer has been thrown out
of court.

Littlejohn was being sued in the High Court over its audits of the
Gooda Walker syndicates at Lloyd's, which ran up losses of almost #1
billion in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

In October 1994, 3,000 Lloyd's investors, or Names, won damages
estimated at about #400 million from the agency that managed their
insurance underwriting (TA 5890).

The Names then sued the auditor, claiming that the syndicates' accounts
had disguised underwriting losses by overstating the value of their
investments. The Names said they would not have invested in later years
had they known of the losses.

The High Court decided that the precedents established in the 1990
Caparo case applied. Whether or not Littlejohn was negligent in
auditing the syndicate was irrelevant as no duty of care was owed to
future investors at Lloyd's.

The case is a setback to attempts by Lloyd's to organise a market-wide
out-of-court settlement of the litigation that has dogged the market
for the last three years. Names are seeking damages for the estimated
#11 billion of losses run up by the market since 1988. There is now
less pressure on the auditors to contribute to the proposed #2.8
billion settlement fund (TA 5898).

Littlejohn senior partner Alastair Campbell said:"The judgment makes
clear the losses were not caused by the auditors, even if there had
been negligence by the auditors, which is something we hotly dispute."

The case related to losses run up on Gooda Walker syndicates 290 and
164's 1989 years of account. Littlejohn now plans to apply to have
another case struck out in relation to syndicate 387, where a claim for
about #80 million has been made by the Gooda Walker Names. Two other
cases, where a total of #8 million is being claimed, will continue to a
full hearing.

The Names are expected to appeal the High Court decision.

DUBLIN'S MCGRATH & CO FORMS ALLIANCE WITH BELFAST PRACTICE

MCGRATH & Co, the Republic of Ireland member of accounting network ACPA
International, has established a formal association with Belfast firm
MTF to cope with its growing need for representation in Northern
Ireland.

McGrath has worked with MTF on a number of projects since the Northern
Irish peace process began 15 months ago. Although McGrath previously
covered the entire island for ACPA, an increase in outside investment
in the north, particularly from the US, has created the need for a
representative firm there.

"The peace process has set it all in motion," said Tom Kavanagh,
managing partner at McGrath. "We've already seen a rise in inward
investment and this can only increase."

McGrath was attracted to MTF because of its specialty in mergers and
acquisitions, an area in which the Dublin firm is not particularly
strong. One of MTF's partners, Michael Townsley, already does some M&A
work in the south, and McGrath hopes to develop this.

Although MTF is not a member of ACPA it will do any referral work to
Northern Ireland in co-operation with the Dublin firm. According to
Kavanagh, McGrath gets"regular work" from ACPA, mostly in the tax
sector, although this does not make up a large portion of its fee
income.

McGrath reported revenues of IR#1.75 million (#1.8 million) in 1995,
putting it 17th in the Irish league tables (TA 5902). Kavanagh
estimates that MTF's revenues for 1995 were about IR#750,000. Combined
revenues at both firms are expected to reach IR#2.7 million in 1996.

McGrath, which operates out of one office, has five partners and a
total staff of 45. MTF, also a one-office firm, has three partners and
a total staff of 25.

ICAEW/CIMA MERGER TO COST 130 JOBS

SOME 130 jobs are expected to go as part of a cost-cutting exercise if
the proposed merger between the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales (ICAEW) and the Chartered Institute of Management
Accountants (CIMA) goes ahead.

Details of the cost cuts were revealed in the prospectus for the
merger, which was published in early December after being approved by
the governing councils of both bodies.

The new organisation, to be known simply as the Institute of Chartered
Accountants, has budgeted to save 20 percent of the combined costs of
the two existing bodies, which employ 630 people between them. ICAEW
chief executive Andrew Colquhoun said efficiencies will be possible as
a result of the inevitable duplication of services currently being
provided by the two bodies.

Colquhoun said the job cuts will be phased in over five years. He
expects few compulsory redundancies since staff turnover at the ICAEW
is currently running at 10 percent to 15 percent.

The savings will allow the institute to reduce its #138 annual
subscription fee by #20, bringing it closer into line with the #110
currently charged by CIMA.

However, Colquhoun denied that cost savings are the main motive behind
the merger. "We are not promoting this on the financial issue," he
said. "We are promoting this because the environment for the profession
is becoming harder and we believe we can serve the interests of
accountants better by being bigger."

The new institute will offer two types of qualification: one aimed at
those training in public practice, who will continue to be known as
"chartered accountants"; and the other for those working in industry,
who will bear the title "chartered management accountant". The Privy
Council granted CIMA members the right to use the "chartered"
designation in early December.

There will be a four-stage education syllabus, consisting of two
foundation levels, an intermediate and a final level. Students will be
time barred if they do not pass their final examinations within seven
years of starting the foundation course. Students will be able to
accumulate examination credits at all levels except the final level.

The "England and Wales" part of the current ICAEW name will be dropped
in an attempt to give an international image to the new body. The plan
involves actively marketing the new qualifications abroad in
competition with the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants.

"This is not marketing for its own sake, but we believe we can offer a
high quality qualification around the world," Colquhoun said."They will
have to meet the standards we have here in the UK, but we do think
there is a market out there for our qualification."

The new institute will have nine regions in England and Wales, each of
which will be able to elect six members to the new council; three from
industry and three from practice. The exception will be London which
will elect 14 members.

There will be further elections in Scotland, Ireland and in regions
around the world such as Malaysia, Hong Kong and South Africa.

The merged institute will have 150,000 members - 109,000 from ICAEW and
41,000 from CIMA.

Members of both institutes are expected to vote on the merger proposal
in April or May.

FORMER BDO PARTNERS STUNNED BY RULING

FORMER PARTNERS of BDO Binder Hamlyn have been stunned by a High Court
ruling which holds them liable for damages, interest and costs of #105
million, arising from the 1990 take-over of one of the firm's audit
clients.

The damages of #65 million are believed to be the highest ever awarded
against a UK accounting firm and have added new urgency to auditors'
search for liability protection.

During the court case, counsel for Binder said the firm had insurance
cover of #71 million, leaving #34 million of the award to be met from
the partners' personal assets. With between 120 and 150 partners
believed to be involved, the average bill could be as high as #280,000
per partner.

The suit related to an agreed bid by electronic security company ADT
for Britannia Security Group in 1990. ADT paid #105 million for
Britannia, basing the price on accounts for fiscal 1989 which had been
audited by Binder.

Following the acquisition, ADT discovered that Britannia's 1989 profits
were #3.2 million, not #8.7 million as stated, and that its net assets
were less than half the #36.5 million shown in the accounts. ADT was
eventually forced to write off its investment and filed suit against
Binder in 1992.

The judge in the case found that Binder had been negligent in its audit
of Britannia, and that, crucially, the firm owed a duty of care to ADT
because of remarks made by Martyn Bishop, the partner who signed off on
the accounts, at a meeting with ADT officials in January 1990.

At that meeting, held shortly before the bid was announced, Bishop was
asked if he stood by his opinion that Britannia's fiscal 1989 accounts
gave a true and fair view of the company's financial health. Bishop
replied that he did.

Binder argued that this "off the cuff remark" in no way constituted a
duty of care to ADT. It said it had not entered into any agreement,
verbal or otherwise, to advise ADT, nor had it been paid for any
advice. The firm cited the landmark Caparo ruling of 1990, which held
that auditors do not owe a duty of care to third parties, regardless of
whether they are negligent.

Binder has pledged to appeal against the decision and is confident that
it will succeed in overturning the verdict."The firm is certain that
the Caparo principles apply," a spokesman said.

BDO Binder Hamlyn ceased trading in October 1994, when the bulk of the
firm merged with Arthur Andersen (TA 5887). Other Binder offices merged
with Stoy Hayward, the current BDO representative in the UK, while some
of the partners joined other accounting firms or went into industry.
Binder Hamlyn is still trying to determine exactly how many partners
are liable in the Britannia case.

ACCA MAY ADOPT A FEDERAL STRUCTURE

THE CHARTERED Association of Certified Accountants (ACCA) looks set to
bow to pressure from radical East London University professor Prem
Sikka to reform the way the body is governed.

Chief executive Anthea Rose put forward proposals at an ACCA council
meeting in early December to disband the current London- based council
and replace it with a federal structure. This will take greater account
of the rights of the association's 18,000 overseas members - 40 percent
of the total - who Sikka has argued are effectively disenfranchised.

The proposed structure devolves power to a number of new regional
councils, which will in turn report to an international committee. A
discussion document outlining the proposals was sent to all ACCA
members on December 15.

An ACCA source said: "It is true the way our council is structured
makes it very difficult for members to play a meaningful role if they
live on the other side of the world. Instead, we are to propose some
form of devolution with a federal structure."

The powers to be devolved will be debated in the discussion document.
It is thought unlikely that the regional councils will have any control
over the examination syllabus. Powers to be devolved could include
direct dealings with regional governments and the issue of guidance and
advice on local auditing accounting and taxation matters.

The changes follow criticism by Sikka that the ACCA is undemocratic.
His call for the association's president to be directly elected by the
membership received widespread support at an extraordinary general
meeting in September. Nearly 3,000 of the 10,000 members who voted
backed the proposal (TA 5901).

The ACCA is not ruling out direct presidential elections, but a change
to the current practice of having the president elected by the council
is not part of the latest proposals.

Sikka has been in a long-running conflict with the association. He has
taken his campaign for reform to Parliament, where he has won the
support of Labour MP Austin Mitchell.

While Sikka said he supports the new federal system, he insisted that
the proposals do not go far enough. He called for more transparency
within the ACCA, open council meetings, access to agenda papers and
minutes, and repeated his call for direct elections to key positions.
"Basically, the people who are leading the organisation need to be
mandated," he said.

Meanwhile, the ACCA's application to change its name to the Association
of Chartered Public Accountants has been turned down by the Privy
Council, the body which must approve all changes to an organisation's
Royal Charter.

In a letter to the ACCA, the council said it objected to the use of the
word "public" in the proposed name. However, it had no problem with the
use of the term "chartered".

In submissions to the council, the Institute of Chartered Accountants
in England and Wales argued that the name change would cause confusion
with the certified public accountant designation used in the US.
Mitchell argued that the ACCA did not act sufficiently in the public
interest for it to merit the title"public".

The ACCA has been asked to come up with a new proposal and expects to
put forward a new name for its members to vote on in the near future.

COMMITTEE SET UP TO REVIEW CADBURY CODE

THREE YEARS after the Cadbury Committee published its landmark code on
the financial aspects of corporate governance in the UK, a new body is
to examine how far compliance with the code has progressed and to
consider whether it needs updating.

Headed by ICI chairman Ronnie Hampel, the Committee on Corporate
Governance will have 12 members drawn mostly from commerce and
industry. They include David Simon, chairman of British Petroleum, and
Northern Foods' chairman Christopher Haskins. The only representative
of the accountancy profession is Coopers & Lybrand chairman Peter
Smith.

The committee's sponsors include the Financial Reporting Council, the
London Stock Exchange, the Confederation of British Industry, and the
Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies.

Apart from reviewing compliance with the Cadbury recommendations,
Hampel's committee will also take account of the so-called Greenbury
proposals in the controversial area of directors' pay (see page 7).

Hampel is anxious that the push to clean up British boardrooms will not
lead to a host of new restrictions on business.

"There is much debate about the pace of change in corporate governance
and it is my intention that the committee will take appropriate time -
and consult widely - before reaching any conclusions on all aspects of
its remit," he said."Above all, we must enhance, not inhibit, the
prospects for UK business in an increasingly-competitive global
marketplace."

The Cadbury report's recommendations included a proposal that company
directors should report on the effectiveness of their system of
internal financial control and on whether the business can continue to
trade as a going concern; that audit committees be comprised solely of
external directors; and, in effect, that the role of chairman and chief
executive should be separated.

The establishment of Hampel's committee comes at a time when a spate of
corporate scandals has led to growing international concern over
corporate governance. In July, France tackled the issue with the Vienot
Report, which recommended a greater role for independent directors and
board sub-committees to deal with the annual audit and the appointment
and remuneration of directors.

On a wider scale, the International Capital Markets Group (ICMG) has
called for more transparent reporting of corporate governance processes
by large listed companies across the globe. Founded as a co-operative
venture by the world's legal and accountancy professions, the ICMG made
its call after analysing the main corporate governance issues arising
in the world's six biggest economies in a report titled, Who holds the
reins?.

In its review of corporate governance practices in Japan, Germany,
France, the US, Canada and the UK, the ICMG found some evidence of
convergence. But it concluded that entrenched cultural and legal
differences mean that the world is not yet ready for common rules to
improve corporate governance.

US TO CRACK DOWN ON PENSIONS FRAUD

US AUDITORS could be required to report financial irregularities in a
company's employee pension funds, if proposed legislation is approved
by Congress.

The Labor Department, which is investigating hundreds of companies
suspected of illegally dipping into their employees' pension funds, is
working closely with the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants (AICPA) to reach agreement on the language in the bill.

The legislation has been around for years in one form or another. But,
even though it would increase government regulation of the work of
auditors, "chances for passage are stronger now than ever before",
according to Richard Steinberg, a member of the AICPA's employee
benefit plans committee and chairman of its emerging issues task force.

The proposed measure was given new life after the Labor Department
found evidence of an increase in pension plan fraud. The department has
civil and criminal investigations in progress against 300 companies for
diverting funds from 401(k) plans, tax- deferred savings accounts set
up by employers. Its caseload is at least triple what it was one year
ago.

In some cases, auditors have found that companies failed to make good
on their obligations to match employee contributions as required by
federal law. In other cases, companies not only reneged on their
obligations, but also diverted employee contributions withheld from
weekly pay cheques.

In the largest Labor Department case, Coleman American, based in
Dothan, Alabama, allegedly withheld several months' worth of
contributions to its 401(k) plan affecting 200 employees. Confronted by
regulators last summer, the company's owner paid the $607,893 that was
due. In another case, a Wisconsin firm diverted $12,354 in
contributions from a plan covering 23 employees before closing its
doors.

The 300 Labor Department enforcement cases represent less than 0.5
percent of the more than 140,000 active 401(k) pension plans, which
have become popular because they limit employer obligations to retirees
and make it easier for workers to take their benefits with them when
they switch jobs. Money contributed to such plans is tax deferred.

Steinberg, who heads Coopers & Lybrand's benefit plan audit practice in
New York, said the Labor Department began a programme last spring to
educate companies on their responsibilities regarding employee benefit
plans. "Only recently has Labor Secretary Robert Reich become very
assertive in emphasising the need for a stronger hand. The emphasis
seems to have shifted from education to something much tougher and
proactive."

According to Steinberg, the Labor Department probe focuses on three
kinds of pension cost discrepancies: companies that do not understand
the law; companies that use the benefit funds to solve temporary
financial problems; and companies that are committing direct theft of
assets or fraud. "The third group of companies appears to be the
smallest group," he said.

If an auditor finds evidence of fraud,"he must identify it on the
auditor's schedule or take exception in the auditor's report",
Steinberg said.

ACCOUNTANTS ADVISED TO BROADEN HORIZONS

ACCOUNTANTS MAY be skilled in auditing and tax advice, but they need to
acquire a more general knowledge of the world around them to compete in
the global marketplace.

That's the view of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC),
the worldwide professional body, which has just issued a draft revision
to its guidelines on education. The new guidance is aimed at ensuring
that accountancy students will be able to cope with such issues as the
globalisation of business enterprises, the relaxation of trade rules
and growing regulatory pressures.

"We're putting greater emphasis on general knowledge rather than strict
technical knowledge," said Milou Kelley, manager of IFAC's education
committee. "We want accountants to develop a broad base of knowledge in
the arts, sciences and humanities that will make them better able to
look at international issues in wider perspective.

"The issues that face professional accountants have become much more
complex. They need to be able to look at complex transactions and know
what is involved so that they can become good decision-makers and
better problem-solvers," she said.

IFAC is less concerned about accountants' ability to apply accounting
rules than about their ability to deal with a situation where no
standards exist. "Once the standards are set, that's the easy part,"
Kelley said.

"We're trying to remove all of the layers surrounding complex issues,
such as changes in technology," she explained. "Our standards are
designed to deal with real life."

The new exposure draft revises its International Education Guideline 9,
Prequalification Education, Tests of Professional Competence and
Practical Experience of Professional Accountants. It recommends that
accounting curriculums place greater emphasis on the development of
intellectual, interpersonal and communication skills, and it stresses
the need for curriculums to help students become committed to high
ethical values and standards.

"This draft guideline continues to develop our thinking on education
for the year 2000 and beyond," said Cecil Donovan, chairman of the IFAC
education committee."Comments and reactions are very important to us at
this stage."

The comment period extends to May 31 1996, to give IFAC member bodies
and others sufficient time to comment on the issues raised in the
document.

Since 1977, IFAC has represented accountants on an international level.
Its membership is comprised of the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants (AICPA) in the US and more than 100 similar groups
from 80 countries.

IFAC's education committee has just issued two pronouncements relating
to information technology: International Education Guideline 11,
Information Technology in the Accounting Curriculum and the discussion
paper, Integrating Information Technology Across The Accounting
Curriculum: The Experience of the Certified General Accountants
Association of Canada.

Guideline 11 establishes a framework for devising an information
technology curriculum, including the skills required by an accountant
who uses information technology, manages information systems, designs
business systems or evaluates information systems.

PRACTICE PROTECTION EATS INTO KPMG AUSTRALIA FEES

KPMG'S AUSTRALIAN firm paid out about 7 percent of total fee income for
practice protection, including professional indemnity insurance, during
fiscal 1995.

According to KPMG's 1995 annual report - the first of its kind to be
released by a major Australian firm - practice protection cost more
than A$21 million (#10.5 million) in the year to June. Total fee income
rose 6 percent to A$301 million.

The firm said that since risk management procedures are now taking
effect, practice protection costs have peaked. "One of the board's main
objectives is to halve this cost but it must be recognised that, given
our past claims record, this will take some years to achieve," the
report said.

A breakdown of fees showed that consulting revenues rose 37 percent to
A$32 million. Audit and corporate finance, the mainstay of KPMG's
business, grew 3 percent to $120 million, while corporate recovery
revenues fell 13 percent to A$12 million.

The firm's gross contribution percentage - fees less labour costs - was
53.1 percent of fee income, compared with 53.5 percent the year before.

In the report, which did not reveal profits, KPMG chairman John
Harkness said revenues are expected to rise 4 percent in the current
fiscal year.

GRANT THORNTON EXPANDS IN UK WITH NEW FIRM

GRANT THORNTON in the UK has continued its expansion programme with the
addition of a two-partner firm which has served London's Polish
community since 1955.

The ten employees at Potworowski Kinast joined Grant Thornton's West
London office on December 1. Potworowski's Polish office has been a
member of Grant Thornton International since 1993 and will continue to
practise as Potworowski Kinast Grant Thornton.

The firm has annual revenues of about #500,000. One of the partners,
managing partner Tad Potworowski, is based in London, the other in
Poland.

Grant Thornton country managing partner David McDonnell said his firm
has supplied Potworowski with training and support since the Polish arm
joined GTI some years ago. "The intention always was that the [London
firm] would join us at some stage," he said.

Acquiring Potworowski, with its strong roots in the Polish community,
ties in with the West London office's strategy of targeting certain
ethnic groups in the capital, McDonnell said.

The latest deal brings to eight the number of firms which have merged
with Grant Thornton in the last 18 months. In October, it acquired
Vandenburghs, another London firm whose three partners were retiring.
That firm had revenues of about #800,000.

"We are actively seeking further acquisitions over the next year,"
McDonnell said. Grant Thornton is in preliminary talks with a number of
local firms, none of which are linked to a national network, he said.

Grant Thornton's revenues rose 6.5 percent to #114 million in the year
to March 1995. Excluding the firm's insolvency business, organic growth
for the current year is forecast at 7 percent to 8 percent. Insolvency
fees are likely to shrink by about #3 million from #24 million last
year, McDonnell said.

TOUCHE ROSS HEADS GROUP BID FOR MILLENIUM CONTRACT

TOUCHE ROSS is heading a consortium which is bidding to run the UK's
#400 million Millenium Festival, planned for the year 2000.

The consortium, called M2000, also includes MAI, the television
franchise owner, construction company Bovis and property group
Stanhope. Touche's role will be as project manager.

The festival will be held at a site in Greenwich and is expected to
attract 50 million visitors over its one-year duration.

Three rival bids appear to be less comprehensive than the M2000
proposal. They include a site at the Birmingham National Exhibition
Centre, which is backed by a promised #50 million from the local
council. The other two bids appear to have failed to win any serious
backing and are almost certainly out of the running.

HLB SIGNS UP KRESTON MEMBER IN SINGAPORE

HLB INTERNATIONAL has strengthened its newly-formed Asia-Pacific region
by signing up Loke Lum & Partners, a two-partner firm which was
previously a member of Kreston International.

Kreston, meanwhile, has linked with David Yeung & Co, a one- partner
unaffiliated practice.

Loke Lum, which became a full member at HLB's annual conference in
Mexico in November, has revenues of about $3 million (#4.7 million) and
employs 50 staff. It has already referred work to HLB members in
Australia, Thailand, Hong Kong, Indonesia and Hungary.

As a result of the link with Loke Lum, HLB has cut its ties with Foo
Kon & Tan, a correspondent firm it shared with Grant Thornton. No fee
income figure is available for Foo Kon, which is nearly three times
bigger than Loke Lum in staff terms.

HLB chief executive Peter Frost said: "Asia-Pacific is a key
development area for HLB, targeted for significant expansion in the
future, and we are delighted to appoint a new representative for the
group in Singapore."

As part of a general restructuring, HLB established a formal Asia-
Pacific regional committee at the annual conference. Daniel Loke,
senior partner of Loke Lum, is one of four members of the council.

Chris Flint, Kreston's international secretary, said Loke Lum's
departure was not a total surprise, and his group "acted quickly" to
plug the gap. David Yeung & Co has revenues of $1 million and employs
around 40 staff.

BEWARE OF THE `FAT CAT' OBSESSION

Some of the Big Six are committed to disclosure of directors' pay as
part of their plans for incorporation. William Gleeson wonders if they
know what they've let themselves in for

WARM BEER, cricket and an obsession with directors' pay. There are some
things people from other parts of the world will never fathom about the
British. When KPMG publishes its results for fiscal 1995 at the end of
January, the main focus of the press will be on the pay of what The
Times has already dubbed the biggest "pride of fat cats" to be revealed
at one time.

Colin Sharman, the firm's senior partner, could be forgiven for
regretting the public fascination with the issue. Speculation about his
salary has been rife, with some estimates putting it as high as #1
million - although KPMG denies the figure will be anywhere near this
level.

Nevertheless, there is known to be a big difference between what new,
young KPMG partners are paid and the salaries of top people at the
firm, particularly in the southeast of England.

Hardly a day goes by without a UK national newspaper publishing details
of what a listed company pays its directors. Reporters are sent up and
down the country by business news editors keen to beat the competition
to the latest "fat cat" revelations.

Annual reports are scrutinised for details of the "directors'
emoluments". During a hostile take-over bid, a close eye is kept on the
various offer and defence documents for details of boardroom pay. The
official stock exchange news service is examined daily for
announcements of changes in directors' shareholdings in their own
company, in case it reveals the award or cashing in of share options.

But a question mark must hang over whether all this is good for British
business. It is arguable that, with a few exceptions, the furore
created every time a director does well for himself may end up damaging
the company he works for.

The advertising industry is a case in point.

When Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of WPP, sought to get
shareholder approval for changes to his pay package, he met with
immense opposition. The big guns from the City institutions came out
against the deal. The press had a field day.

True, Sorrell was after a lot of money. The package could have been
worth almost #30 million over six years. But he argued that similar
deals were given to rival advertising agency bosses around the world.
At one stage, Sorrell threatened that if he did not get his way, he
would take his agency lock, stock and barrel to the US. In the end, a
compromise was reached, which allowed Sorrell to take a lot of money
away if the company met certain earnings growth targets.

But things were not amicably resolved at what was Saatchi & Saatchi.
Maurice Saatchi found shareholder opposition to his pay deal so strong
that he was forced to leave the company. In doing so he took half of
the agency's best creative staff with him. Now, another business has
been created and is doing well having poached a significant number of
former Saatchi clients.

The issues are more complex in the case of the privatised utilities.
These were once regarded as bureaucratic edifices staffed by career
civil servants who never thought they would earn more than #50,000 a
year.

After privatisation, the likes of British Gas chief executive Cedric
Brown saw their salaries take off. Brown earned #275,000 in fiscal
1995. Then British Gas proposed that for the current fiscal year, his
basic salary should be increased to #475,000. Add to that a share bonus
worth 125 percent of the basic - that's #590,000 - and Brown is set to
earn over #1 million this year. Not bad for a man who just a few years
earlier was an unaspiring career civil servant.

But, as legitimate as the public interest is in British Gas, it is hard
to see the interest the public could have in the pay of a senior
partner at a chartered accountancy firm. How the firm's profits are
doled out is surely a private matter between the senior partner and the
rest of the partnership.

Even more of a mystery is that since the accounting firms are not
required to reveal this level of detail, why are they doing it? Under
UK law, KPMG will only be required to disclose directors' pay for KPMG
Audit Plc, the incorporated part of the business. But, the firm has
said that it will go further and disclose full audited accounts for the
partnership.

Ernst & Young, which is considering becoming a limited liability
partnership (see page 1), is also going further than it needs to. It
has said it will reveal the pay of the management committee that runs
the firm and the pay of all its partners.

This information will be presented in a table which will band the
remuneration of the partners in #5,000 steps, as is the practice in UK
company accounts. Yet who, other than the curious, will benefit from
such disclosure?

The media hype has the effect of introducing an anti-success culture.
This in turn can prevent people from aspiring to become what some might
deride as a "fat cat", but what others would describe as a success in
business.

The accounting firms have long kept a close secret of what their
partners earn. The average Big Six partner is undoubtedly on close to
#200,000. Making that known could damage accountants' calls for
protection from liability. The massive damages against BDO Binder
Hamlyn has undoubtedly provoked some public sympathy towards the
profession (see page 3), but how long will that last when it is known
what partners earn?

The publicity could be destructive to the profession in other ways.
Revealing that, despite the cost of litigation, partners are all
wealthy, may provide an excuse for some clients to try and force fees
down further.

Another factor is the pressure that disclosure will put on executives
at less profitable firms to justify their high salaries. No bad thing
for the firms concerned, of course, but one wonders whether the"fat
cats" of the accounting world are ready for the challenge.

PUSHING FOR CHANGE

As plans for the merger between the Chartered Institute of Management
Accountants and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales take shape, Nick Speechly talks to CIMA president Allan McNab

LEADING MEMBERS of the UK accountancy profession must have lost
countless chargeable hours over the years engaged in fruitless merger
talks between different professional bodies. Allan McNab, president of
the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA), hopes that
the time he has spent discussing a merger with the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) has not added to the
tally.

In early December, McNab presented CIMA's ruling council with detailed
proposals for the merger thrashed out over the preceding year by no
fewer than 14 joint working parties of the two institutes. The
prospectus for the merger has now been sent out to members of both
bodies (see page 3), and in January, the institutes will embark on
energetic campaigns aimed at explaining their plans to members. If
market research exercises show the proposals are well received, members
will vote on the plans in April or May.

The UK accountancy profession has a long history of ambitious plans for
organisational change which have come to naught - including the most
recent Bishop committee proposals for a wholesale regrouping of the
institutes. Divisions among the different bodies and opposition to
change from many of their members have derailed many proposals.

Distinctions blurred

So, what benefits from a merger between CIMA and the ICAEW can justify
McNab and his colleagues spending yet more time in negotiations?

McNab can point to his own career, working with a CIMA qualification as
a partner at Coopers & Lybrand, as indicative of some of the forces
driving change. With some CIMA members working in public practice
firms, as he is, and many more ICAEW members working in industry, the
distinctions between the roles of the institutes are becoming more
blurred.

"It goes to show that the rationalisation of the profession might be a
good idea," he said.

The proposals would produce a stronger combined institute, focused
equally on the needs of both accountants in public practice and those
in industry, according to McNab. Members who move between audit firms
and business would benefit from strengthened support from within the
same organisation, while the structure will also recognise the
differing needs of the two groups.

"The two institutes overlap in the middle," McNab said. "But, there are
also distinctive parts of both which we would like to preserve in two
streams of qualification."

The combined institute would offer two qualifications, with those
qualified in public practice retaining the "chartered accountant" title
and those trained in industry using "chartered management accountant".
The two syllabi would include many common elements, and the process of
transferring from one qualification to another is to be simplified.

For CIMA, a major benefit of the merger could be in attracting more
employers to offer formal management accountancy training schemes. With
many corporate finance directors holding ICAEW qualifications, they are
likely to be more enthusiastic in supporting trainees in their
companies for their own institute than they might have been in the past
for a separate CIMA qualification, McNab suggested.

"I'd hope that the combined institute will be so attractive and
prestigious that we'd encourage more industrial and commercial
companies to set up formal programmes," he said.

The gain of the prestigious "chartered" tag would be another benefit of
the merger for CIMA members, although McNab did not rank this
particularly highly.

"It's a factor - but it's not an overwhelming one," he said, pointing
out that CIMA has already received Privy Council permission to use the
"chartered management accountant" label in its own right (see page 3).

The CIMA president admitted that the ICAEW's attempts to set up its own
industry management scheme - TOPP (training outside public practice) -
had encouraged support from CIMA for a merger. "Obviously if we were to
remain independent, and the ICAEW managed to adapt its training so it
was successful in industry, there would be a serious competitor for
training capacity. One of the minor advantages of a merger would be
that it would take care of the competitive threat."

While many attempts to merge institutes in the past have fallen in the
face of members' resistance to change, McNab can have a degree of
confidence that his members, at least, broadly support the principle of
merging. Market research carried out among members over the Bishop
proposals showed support for restructuring, and also showed support for
discussions with other institutes should Bishop collapse. Further back,
CIMA members also voted in favour of the abortive plans for a
reorganisation of the profession proposed in 1970.

Benefits to members

"Our members voted for rationalisation at that time, and we've been
consistent ever since for the last 25 years," McNab boasted.

It is more difficult for leaders of the two institutes to be confident
of gaining the support of ICAEW members. But the ICAEW and its members
will also benefit from the move, according to McNab. Members
transferring to industry after training in public practice particularly
will gain through having a simpler route to a further qualification
specifically designed for their new career path.

"What we hope is that when a chartered accountant moves into industry,
he would see the benefits of doing the other side of the qualification -
 doing the business planning and management accounting," McNab said. "I
actually think that the combination of the two - qualifying through
both routes - would be the best possible accounting qualification."

What is more, the combined institute would be better placed to adapt to
changes in the structure of training within the profession.

"The nature of audit firms is changing. It's less dependent on lots of
junior staff and more on senior people, with computer auditing
techniques and that sort of thing. For people who want to become an
accountant nowadays, there are less opportunities through the classic
chartered accountancy route."

Combination with CIMA provides the ICAEW with the best way of adapting
by providing more training in industry, McNab argued. "If they were
going to be successful in training in industry, they would have to do
something that was very much like what CIMA does anyway," he said."So,
they might as well join us."

IS INCORPORATION THE ANSWER?

In the last issue of TA, Richard Turnor looked at the unlimited
liability of partners. This month, he considers whether incorporation
provides a solution

THE NEWS that KPMG is to incorporate part of its audit practice,
combined with the award in the ADT case (see page 3), has generated
great interest in incorporation as a means of protecting partners'
estates.

Both accountants and solicitors can now, like members of other
professions, practise in corporate form. A company has a separate legal
personality, and the shareholders of a limited liability company in
principle are not liable for the acts or defaults of the company
itself. Thus, the shareholders of a professional firm who would
otherwise be partners can protect their personal estates even if the
business itself is at risk from claims against the company. In the
event of a catastrophic claim, the shareholder/director may lose his
livelihood, but at least his personal assets will be safe. It may also
be possible to protect different parts of the business from problems in
other parts by incorporating a series of separate companies.

But, it is important to be aware of what incorporation cannot achieve.

It will not, for example, release those who were partners before
incorporation from pre-incorporation liabilities, leases and debts.

Nevertheless, this is not necessarily a reason to reject incorporation.
In time, claims arising from prior advice will become statute barred,
the lease will expire, all pre- incorporation partners will retire and
eventually the company's shareholders will have no responsibility for
pre-incorporation debts.

A director or employer of the incorporated company who gives negligent
advice may still incur personal liability under normal agency
principles. A director who fails to supervise an employee adequately
may also incur liability. Thus, incorporation does not provide complete
protection to those immediately involved, but at least the directors
should have no personal liability for matters for which they are not
responsible. Furthermore, creditors may not in practice think it
worthwhile to claim against a small group of directors and employees
who have been directly involved.

KPMG has said that it will incorporate the high-risk part of its audit
practice (TA 5902), while continuing other aspects of its business in
partnership. Arrangements of this nature need to be structured very
carefully. A claimant who is unable to recover adequate compensation
from the company will explore every possible means of getting
compensation from the partners. An obvious line of attack is to argue
that he thought he was dealing with a partnership rather than with a
company, or that the company was a sham which ought not to stand
between him and his claim against the partners.

Care must, therefore, be taken to ensure that the company genuinely
carries on its own business, and that all advice and services provided
by the company are demonstrably given by or on behalf of the company,
and not on behalf of the partnership. It will not be enough to ensure
that the engagement letter is written on behalf of the company. Where
it is intended that a client should have no claim against the
partnership, all advice must be given by or on behalf of the company
and all correspondence must be conducted on the letterhead of the
company. All time incurred on behalf of the company must be recorded
separately from time recorded working for the partnership.

It should be remembered that if the company becomes insolvent, it may
then have a claim against the partnership relating to services provided
to the company by partners and employees of the partnership. Care
should be taken to insulate the partnership from these difficulties.
For example, those who provide advice on behalf of the company should
be employed directly by the company to do so.

If a partnership incorporates in order to protect the partners'
personal estates and the company then incurs a liability to a client
which it is unable to meet in full, the client is the loser. Thus, the
added protection of incorporation is obtained at the expense of clients
and others who deal with the firm. How are they likely to react?

Clients are likely to be particularly concerned about the financial
strength of the company after incorporation. Partnerships do not have
to publish their accounts, and the fact that the incorporated firm must
do so may be of some comfort to clients since it will give them a
regular indication of the company's net financial position.

However, the published accounts will not disclose the company's
insurance arrangements and some clients may ask for details of cover
maintained and of the identity and financial security of the insurers.
Most firms will be reluctant to disclose this kind of information since
it could be valuable to potential claimants. If the clients are not
satisfied with the information provided about the company, they may be
tempted to take their business to a firm which still practises in
partnership.

But, clients may attach more importance to other factors, such as the
degree of skill of the proposed client service team, and its
familiarity with the client's business and the issues involved. Indeed,
the track record of the client service team may often be regarded as a
strong indication that a claim is unlikely to arise in the first place.
Clients may not think that the remote risk of a claim that cannot be
met in full justifies losing the benefits of a long-term relationship
that has been otherwise successful, especially if those firms which
could offer an equivalent service have also incorporated.

In conclusion, while incorporation may not be a complete solution to
the problems of unlimited liability, if it is carefully planned, it
should protect the personal estates of partners from future liabilities
for which they are not personally responsible. In practice, clients may
be unlikely to think that the reduced protection justifies abandoning
an otherwise satisfactory relationship, especially if the alternative
firms also practise as corporate firms. In such circumstances, why does
any professional firm continue to practise partnership?

The main problems are likely to arise in the context of taxation, both
of the profits of the business and of transactions where shares in the
incorporated business change hands. I would not presume to instruct a
readership of accountants on such matters.

Next month, I will consider the implications of limited liability
partnerships in jurisdictions outside the UK.

Richard Turnor, a partner at London law firm Allen & Overy since 1985,
advises professional partnerships on all aspects of their partnership
structure and documentation.

PROFESSIONAL SURVIVAL

Ronald Gage, chairman of the Canadian Institute of Chartered
Accountants and head of Ernst & Young in Canada, talks to Gundi Jeffrey
about the major issues facing the profession

IN CANADA, as elsewhere, the accounting profession is facing
unprecedented challenges. Years of recession, followed by economic
stagnation have flattened revenue growth at most of the firms in the
country.

Traditional audit services were further eroded by an amendment to the
Canadian Business Corporation Act in 1994 which eliminated the
requirement of privately-held companies to file audited financial
statements. Litigation in the wake of business failures, although not
as fierce here as in the US, for example, continue to dog the firms.
Times are tough, and Canada's accountants are fighting back.

The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) is now in the
throes of several major initiatives aimed at ensuring that its members
continue to provide relevant, expert and valuable services to Canada's
business community and thereby hang on to their pre-eminence in the
marketplace.

The body, which has 58,000 members, differs from other accounting
institutes in the world in that it alone is responsible for setting
national standards for accounting and auditing. These standards are
recognised in company, securities and banking law at both federal and
provincial level. The CICA develops the Uniform Final Examination all
aspiring CAs must pass to qualify, as well as joint continuing
education programmes with the provincial institutes.

It also liaises with the provincial institutes, which are responsible
for the licensing and governance of their members.

TA recently spoke to Ronald Gage, chairman and chief executive of Ernst
& Young Canada and current chairman of the CICA, about some of the more
pressing challenges facing the Big Six in Canada and the chartered
accounting profession generally.

Gage qualified as a CA in 1964, while with Clarkson Gordon, which is
now E&Y. He became a partner in 1970 and worked his way up the ranks to
become executive partner and chairman of the firm's management
committee in 1986, chief operating officer in 1987 and E&Y chairman and
chief executive in 1993.

As chairman of the profession, as well as head of one of the largest
firms in Canada, Gage has a unique perspective on the profession's
problems and opportunities in today's information- driven society.

TA: Earlier this year, Ontario Premier Mike Harris endorsed the concept
of limited liability partnerships (LLPs) for Ontario's chartered
accountants (TA 5900). Have you any idea when we will see this backing
translated into legislation?

Gage: Although every provincial institute has, for the last year or so,
had a task force working on this subject, three provincial governments
have expressed some commitment to proceed. In Ontario, the timing of
when the government will consider this matter really depends on its
priorities and legislative agenda. My own thinking is that is unlikely
to appear on the government's agenda before spring 1996. I would be
hopeful that we might well see some legislation in Ontario within the
coming year.

The governments in Nova Scotia and Alberta have also been addressing
the matter, and I'm hopeful that we will see the legislation some time
before the end of 1996.

TA: If it happens in Ontario first, how will that affect the structure
of the national firms?

Gage: My understanding is that the firms could establish their national
partnership in any province that has the LLP legislation. That would
then become their governing legislation and would be respected on an
interprovincial basis. I suspect that, once one or two provinces have
introduced this kind of legislation, the other provinces would follow
fairly promptly.

TA: Is the profession lobbying to push the matter along?

Gage: We have a group in place charged with maintaining an active
dialogue with the provincial governments to make sure that they clearly
understand what the issues are, that we have an opportunity to answer
any questions or reservations they might have, and to keep up to date
on the status of each province.

TA: How exactly does an LLP function?

Gage: It enables you to practise in partnership form but have the same
kind of protection against liabilities that you would have under the
limited liability corporate form. It protects the personal assets of
the partners in the firm, but it does not protect the assets of the
firm itself. The one exception is that, if one or more of the partners
were found to be personally negligent in connection with a legal
matter, then their personal assets would not be protected.

TA: Once the legislation comes into effect, is that enough? Will it
give the firms the protection they are seeking?

Gage: LLP legislation is really just the first step. The far more
important issue is the very inequitable situation the firms face under
joint and several liability. That's even a more serious problem than
the partners' personal assets being at risk. It puts the entire firm at
risk.

To deal with that, we are trying to encourage legislative reform in
Canada that would provide for proportionate liability in the way that
damages are allocated in the case of professional negligence
litigation. If we're found to be, say, 5 percent contributory to a
problem, we would be responsible for only 5 percent of any financial
award that was given, irrespective of whether other defendants were
able to pay their awards.

TA: Are you making any headway with this one?

Gage: I would say yes. We are doing this on a co-ordinated basis right
across the country, working with all the provincial governments. They
have been quite prepared to hear our story, and several have indicated
a willingness to examine the matter on a more formal basis over the
coming one or two years and determine whether there is a legislative
inequity that needs to be addressed.

TA: In the meantime, what has been happening in the insurance market
for the firms?

Gage: Generally, the commercial insurance market continues to be very
expensive, continues to offer relatively limited coverage, and the Big
Six have to provide a very large proportion - 50 percent or more -
through their own captive insurance companies.

TA: So what are the firms doing in terms of risk management strategies
to reduce exposure to lawsuits?

Gage: Over the past two or three years, all the firms have been
focusing on managing their risks. In the case of Ernst & Young
International, I chaired a task force a couple of years ago on how we
could deal more effectively with risk management in light of the
litigation scene.

The kinds of things we put in place are: continuing to educate our
people on the risks that are out there and how to best manage those
risks; putting enormous emphasis on the acceptance and continuance of
clients; and re-emphasising and continually improving our approach to
our internal quality control process. We are also re-engineering our
audit methodologies to heighten our focus on the risk of the industry
the client operates in, and the risk profile of the individual client,
so that we can understand where those business and operating risks are
to direct our audit activities accordingly.

We also strongly support the various initiatives that are going on in
the areas of sound corporate governance. We think that improved
corporate governance practices go a long way to helping us manage the
risks, and part of that is, of course, a strong and effective audit
committee.

TA: What are risky clients and might you decide not to continue
auditing them?

Gage: We, along with other firms, have declined to take on prospective
clients, and have decided reluctantly to part ways with existing
clients where we felt that their risk profile became inappropriate for
us. Certain industries, such as hi-tech, are much riskier than others
in terms of the potential rate for business failure. You also have to
look at the quality of the corporate governance, the quality of the
internal controls and the quality of management. You must always be
concerned with the integrity of the people you're dealing with.

TA: Moving on to your role as chair of the CICA, what kind of agenda
had you built yourself before you started out?

Gage: It seems to me that, to be successful over the long term, our
profession has be relevant to the society we operate in; we have to be
pre-eminent and we have to be attractive to retain the best people. We
have been experiencing tremendous change and turbulence in the Canadian
economy, which has had a huge impact on us over the last five or ten
years. It seemed to me that, when I got on the ladder to become chair
of the CICA, we needed to take one of these longer, more far-reaching,
very integrated views of the profession and create a new vision for the
future.

That was the number one item on my agenda and I'm pleased that, last
February, we created the Vision Task Force (TA 5898). This task force
will report to the board of governors on a preliminary basis in
December, offering its long-term view of the future and a series of
recommendations on what action the profession should take over the
course of the coming years.

It will address several issues. Like, should we be separating
certification, that is, becoming a chartered accountant, from
licensure, that is, the right to practise public accounting? Should we
formally recognise specialisation? What amount and type of experience
should be required in the assurance services area to get your CA? How
do we ensure reciprocity and harmonisation among the provinces?
Accounting firms are doing a lot more than accounting. How do we
determine fees and billings? Who can or can't be a partner? They're
also looking at the very governance of the CA profession itself. There
is nothing off the table. There are no sacred cows.

TA: Did you have anything else you wanted to accomplish as chair of the
CICA?

Gage: Another area of real deep interest to me, really an offshoot of
the Vision project, is that we have to re-examine how and where we
provide our assurance and attestation services. Our traditional role as
auditors has been to audit historic cost financial statements.

As we move out of an industrial economy to an information and knowledge
economy, some of the most important assets won't be on a historic cost
financial statement. Intangible assets such as intellectual capital,
human resources, research and development, and innovation, don't appear
on financial statements. Likewise, we probably have to find new ways to
measure performance in this emerging information economy.

I believe that, as we change our focus and learn to address the more
important assets of the new economy, auditors can play a useful role in
what are now called non-traditional attestation areas. I think the
challenge is for us to identify what those areas are and to what extent
they will have a marketplace value. We shouldn't be trying to sell an
attestation service just because we can do it. We should be focused on
the marketplace to see where the market believes there will be value in
third-party assurance. Then we have to establish ourselves in those
areas.

For example, there might be value in users knowing that certain
commercial databases had a process to keep the information accurate and
timely. An audit firm might go in and evaluate the procedures for
maintaining the database. There might be areas in the environmental
field where there was a desire to know to what degree a company had
good processes and systems in place to monitor compliance with
environmental regulations.

Right now, a lot of this is quite speculative and we need to examine
where the values of our society are changing and what kind of
information is going to become critical in performance evaluation in
the future and whether that performance information would be more
valuable if it had an auditor's opinion on it. I think there is a
really critical issue to keep our profession relevant to our society.

Again we have established a small task force that, over the next few
years, will examine this area in a comprehensive fashion. It is co-
ordinating its work with a similar committee in the US. TA: Any other
challenges?

Gage: The big issue we haven't talked directly about is attractiveness.
We have to make sure the profession is dynamic and challenging, that
members are highly respected and regarded within society. And we have
to make sure that it's financially rewarding. That's the only way we're
going to continue attracting the very best people. Like any profession,
we're only as good as the quality of people in it.

SUCCESS BREEDS SUCCESS

In Malaysia, healthy economic growth and a flood of investment is
creating a lucrative market for accounting firms. Sally Roden reports

THE LAST ten years have seen a remarkable economic turnaround in
Malaysia. In the mid-1980s, with the country deep in recession, the
government was forced to extend university courses from three to four
years in a bid to combat unemployment.

Today, the problem isn't a lack of jobs; it's an acute shortage of
skilled labour in every industry sector. The government has even had to
reverse its decision of a decade ago and cut university courses back to
three years.

Economic growth has been impressive. In each of the last seven years,
gross domestic product has risen by more than 8 percent.

Such economic success, combined with a stable political environment -
the National Front Coalition has been in power for 38 years - has
resulted in a flood of investment into the country. And that kind of
investment - RM38.4 billion (#10 billion) in 1994 alone - is good news
for accounting firms.

"Growth has been bullish and will continue for at least the next three
years," said Ian Appleby, shortly before retiring as Asia- Pacific
regional managing partner at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International.

"There has been plenty of infrastructural projects and many government
agencies are being privatised which results in investment," said Goh
Joon Hai, managing partner of Hew & Tan, the local member of Moores
Rowland International.

Under a privatisation programme launched over ten years ago, roads,
railways, the national airline, hospitals, telecommunications and power
generators have all been sold off. More recently, the government
announced that a further 200 state- owned bodies were to be privatised,
which is likely to result in more work for accountants.

Another source of overseas funds is the government's recently adopted
strategy of turning Malaysia into an international financial services
centre. In June, it announced a range of measures to liberalise the
country's capital markets, while two new derivatives exchanges are
expected to open this autumn.

In response to the influx of foreign investors, accounting firms have
had to change the kind of services they offer.

Chris Low, tax manager at HALS & Associates, said his firm's clients
used to be concerned only with tax compliance. "Now they have a
different attitude and look more to consulting to minimise their tax
exposure," he said. Changes in tax regulations occur every year, he
said, as the government moves towards greater emphasis on indirect
taxation.

Goh said Hew & Tan is providing more management consulting and tax
services. "Increased investment has meant more tax payers and more tax
work," he said. Taxation is currently handled by a civil service
department but there is a move afoot to establish an inland revenue
board which would be independent of the civil service. There is also a
parallel move to introduce a system of self-assessment, which would be
good news for accounting firms.

Hew & Tan has also been active in corporate finance. "We have played a
big role in helping clients gain public listings," Goh said. "We select
a merchant banker and are involved in the initial public issue."

The government has also encouraged Malaysian companies to expand into
other markets in southeast Asia. During 1995, it introduced a law that
allowed all profits earned outside Malaysia to be repatriated for
investment free of tax.

"Companies with expertise in plantation are buying land in Indonesia
and Vietnam," said Zainal Putih, country managing partner at Arthur
Andersen. "Other companies which are experts in road building,
particularly because Malaysia's north/south motorway has just been
completed, are setting up in India and Vietnam where these services are
needed."

This drive overseas has provided new challenges for accounting firms.
"As Malaysia advances towards developed nation status, it can be
expected that competition in the profession will intensify and clients
will become more demanding," said Lai Siew Peng, practice development
manager at Ernst & Young.

While few Malaysian firms were prepared to disclose revenue figures for
last year, most of those that did reported robust growth. More telling
are the staff figures. Of the 23 firms that replied to TA's survey,
only three recorded a decline in total head-count.

None of the Big Six would reveal fee income figures, but in terms of
total staff, E&Y is the market leader with 1,222 employees. The firm's
clients include the state-owned Bank Bumiputra, agriculture and
fisheries group Multi-Purpose Holdings and Malaysia's largest
conglomerate, Renong Holdings.

Lai said the biggest areas of growth for E&Y are tax and consulting.
She believes the healthy growth in the Malaysian market is set to
continue. "The anticipated robust economic activity, rising business
confidence, lowering of corporation tax [to 30 percent] and the
increase in reinvestment allowance are among the reasons," she said.

In second place is KPMG with an estimated total staff of 973. TA puts
the firm's total partner numbers at 23 and professional staff at 750.

Arthur Andersen comes next with total staff of 906, up 4.4 percent from
a year earlier. This figure does not include Andersen Consulting.

According to Zainal, Andersen has benefited greatly from the
government's privatisation programme. He said many of the privatisation
contracts go to the Big Six "because of the international nature and
complexity of the work".

Fourth in the staff rankings is Price Waterhouse, with estimated total
staff of 826, followed by Coopers & Lybrand on 722.

Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, which also operates under its local name of
Kassim Chan & Co., takes sixth place in the tables with total staff of
714, a rise of 5.8 percent on the previous year.

Unlike their western counterparts, firms in Malaysia have been largely
unaffected by fee pressure in the audit sector. "Price competition is
not a problem. Clients are concerned with quality, not price," said
Chia Kwong Chow, managing partner of KC Chia & Noor, the MacIntyre
Strater affiliate.

Part of the reason for this is the Malaysian Institute of Accountants'
(MIA) monitoring of audit fees. Until three years ago the MIA
stipulated a minimum audit fee. It now simply offers a guideline of
fees that should be charged.

By far the biggest problem facing the Malaysian profession is a
shortage of staff. The country's thriving commercial sector can afford
to offer high salaries in order to lure staff from accounting firms,
while stringent immigration laws make it hard to bring in expatriate
staff.

"This country has had about 8 percent growth for about eight years.
With a population of only 20 million, problems are inevitable," said
Zainal at Andersen. "Opportunities pop up everywhere."

Kim Guan, managing partner of Kreston International member firm THLG
Kreston - M, believes the only way around the staff shortages is to
offer higher salaries. But others see potential pitfalls in such a
strategy.

"This pushes up the cost of production and can push up prices," said
Low at HALS. "The work environment must be good, and every individual
must be looked at separately to find out what his needs are." He
believes the government will have to deal with this growing problem
soon.

Other small firms say the biggest difficulty they face is clients
moving over to Big Six firms when they reach a certain size.

"Most of the big assignments are dominated by the Big Six," Chia said.
"The survival of the smaller firms depends on the partner's personal
contact and the market niche carved out by the firm."

But, as Goh at Hew & Tan pointed out, this is not a problem unique to
Malaysia. "It happens in every country when clients grow to a certain
size," he said. "We have lost one or two jobs over the last two years
but this was not a case of clients defecting to the Big Six."

In response to the growing globalisation of the profession, more firms
are adopting international names. THLG Kreston adopted the Kreston
moniker 18 months ago. "From the client point of view, it shows the
firm is moving in a certain direction, even though it is not a Big Six
firm," he said. International work makes up about 15 percent of the
firm's total business.

Chia & Noor has not adopted the MacIntyre Strater name. Chia does not
think it would offer the firm any advantage. "We have largely local
clients, and membership of MacIntyre Strater is not very useful for
this type of client," he said.

The main professional issue on the agenda in 1995 was the proposed
merger between Malaysia's two accounting bodies. The statutory body,
the MIA, and the older Malaysian Association of Certified Public
Accountants (MICPA), a private association established by chartered
accountants who qualified in England, are in the process of formalising
the agreement. It was the MICPA which originally governed the
accounting profession in Malaysia, before the MIA was established in
1967.

"Two bodies are not justified for a relatively small number of
accountants," Zainal said. The MIA has about 8,000 members and the
MICPA about 4,000, while some accountants are members of both.

Some people hope that the merger will bring about professional change
in the country. For example, Malaysian accountants are not allowed to
advertise, a legacy of the British influence on the MICPA, according to
Zainal. He thinks this will have to change. "Customers and the public
need more information," he said. "This is one anomaly in the
advancement of the profession."

Looking to the year ahead, most accountants believe the favourable
business climate will continue. The economy is forecast to grow by over
8 percent again, and Malaysia's enhanced role throughout southeast Asia
is expected to produce new business opportunities. In terms of economic
muscle, Zainal said,"we are now moving on to the same plane as
Singapore and Hong Kong".

The Best and Worst of 1995: Diamonds & Dogs


Each year as the holiday season approaches, the editorial staff at Accounting
Technology gathers for one of the most enjoyable tasks of the year-choosing
products for our annual Diamonds and Dogs article.  Pouring through countless
back issues of computer and industry trades, newspaper clippings, and our own
notes accumulated over the year, we narrow down our choices until we wind up
with the dozen and a half "awards" presented here.

This year, things were really pretty slow for the first half of the year.
With many vendors waiting for the release of Windows 95, not all that much
exciting happened until late summer.  At least, that's what it seems like in
retrospect.  In actuality, it was an interesting year all around.  And, as has
been the trend in recent years, much of what took place was of benefit to you,
both in terms of what you can accomplish, and what it costs to do so.  This is
reflected in the large number of Diamonds, with just a smattering of Mixed
Bags and Dogs.


The brightest diamond of all

Finally, no article on the best of 1995 would be complete without a nod to the
"best of the best."  To the staff here at Accounting Technology, that's you
the reader.

With this first issue of the new year, everyone at Accounting Technology would
like to wish you and yours a happy, healthy, and profitable New Year!

So, without further ado, and presented in no particular order (and with no
real malice intended), here are our choices for the Diamonds and Dogs of 1995.


DIAMONDS

Sometimes you Win(95)...

And it seems as though Microsoft has indeed won big with this newest release
of its graphical operating system.  Often delayed, and put through the largest
beta test in history (more on this later), the software was finally released
with much fanfare on August 24th.  The papers reported users lining up in
computer stores to purchase the upgrade when it went on sale at midnight.
And, with the OEM deals Microsoft cut with hardware vendors, there are
millions of copies out there already, with a fairly large proportion of them
actually being used, rather than stuck on the shelf.

More conservative users, including many accountants, are biding their time,
waiting for a second release.  Of course, as magazine editors, no one expects
us

to be all that conservative, so we followed Win95 through the end of the beta
test and used it exclusively on our production machines (we still test
hardware with Win 3.11, unless it's a PC that comes with Win95 pre-installed).
And, we have to admit that a lot of the hype surrounding Win95 is justified.

We installed it on several workstations effortlessly, while one hung up until
a network card was removed.  The new desktop is really a big improvement over
Win 3.11, and once you get used to it, Windows Explorer is more powerful than
the File Manager it replaces (though you can continue to use File Manager if
you prefer).

Plug and Play, when it works, is a joy, and a terror when it doesn't.  All
told, just as with any operating system that's preceded it (including IBM's
OS/2 Warp), Microsoft Windows 95 has its good points and bad.

Overall, we started out liking it, and as we discover just how to use some of
its not-so-obvious features, that liking grows.


2+2 finally = 4

Last year at this time, Intel was just recovering from a media blitz nailing
the vendor on its cover-up of math problems inherent in its Pentium processor.
Jokes were rampant, and Intel was desperately trying to find some graceful way
out of the mess.  It finally bowed to the inevitable and offered to replace
any Pentium that contained the fault.  You had to give a credit card number,
but if you actually returned the faulty chip, your charge account was never
charged.

This strategy worked just fine.  Today, the Pentium CPU rules.  Sure, you can
still buy a 486, but why would you want to?  Everything goes better with a
Pentium, and system prices on the 75-MHz version (the 60- and 66-MHz CPUs have
all but disappeared) are under $2,000.  Even notebooks are Pentium powered.

Cyrix and AMD are still able competitors, carrying the banner for their "5X86"
technology.  But while the alternate CPUs are powerful, Intel's Pentium still
has the edge in both power and market share.  But that's right now.  You never
know what the future will bring.


How much is that accounting package in the Window(s)?

Accountants, as a professional group, have been rather slow to adopt Windows.
And even those who have moved into the Windows environment haven't embraced
Windows-based accounting applications with much gusto.

Part of this is that while the benefits of Windows-based productivity
applications such as word processing and spreadsheets are pretty obvious,
accounting itself is such a data entry oriented task that it's been difficult
to understand the benefits that a visually oriented approach could offer.  To
borrow from the last, short-lived "Zorro" TV series, most of us just want to
"Get in, make some Z's, and get out."

This situation has resulted in a sort of Catch 22.  With accountants resistant
to Windows-based accounting, vendors have been hesitant to invest much money
and time in R&D.  With few packages available, accountants haven't felt much
pressure to change.

That's changed pretty dramatically over the last two years.  It happened first
in the consumer market the year before last.  Windows-based packages from
Peachtree, Intuit, Microsoft, and scores of other vendors started to dominate
the market.  Not only in accounting applications, but in retail tax prep as
well.  With much of their Windows R&D already a sunk cost, many of these
vendors turned their attention to the professional market.  1995 saw a flood
of products announced and shipped.  And those vendors that don't already have
a Windows product line will most likely offer one this year.  When Win95 was
announced, we received almost two dozen press releases from accounting and tax
software vendors announcing Win95 compliant packages.

We're convinced that Windows-based applications offer concrete benefits in
ease of use, with drop-down menus, a consistent interface, pick-lists, and
similar features.  Easier to use also means easier to learn, so your training
and re-training costs go down as well.

If you're still primarily a DOS shop, it's time for you to take a close look
at Windows applications.  In many cases, they really are better.


CD-ROM gets faster, easier, and cheaper

1995 will also be remembered as the year that CD-ROM became a standard, and
even expected, feature on desktop PCs.  Much of the reason for this is a
one-two punch.  First, the year marked a switch from SCSI- and AT-interfaced
drives to the ATAPI IDE standard, which allows a drive just to plug into a
hard disk cable or second IDE channel on the motherboard if available.

This easy interfacing came along with the arrival of inexpensive quad-speed
drives, which dropped in price from over $400 at the start of the year to
under $150 by year's end.  When you purchase them with a complete system, or
as part of an upgrade kit, it's quite possible to receive a quad-speed drive
that costs in the $100 range.

But quad-speed is hardly even the state of the art.  Driven by more demanding
multimedia applications, six-speed drives are plentiful.  Diamond Multimedia
Systems is shipping an eight-speed drive with its top-of-the-line upgrade kit,
and several vendors are showing (but not yet shipping) ten-speed units.

Many of you already have CD-ROM drives.  But with the silver disc now the
distribution media of choice, if you don't yet have a CD-ROM drive, it's time
to add one.  And if you have a slower drive, it's not very expensive to
upgrade to one of the newer, speedier units.


ZIP and EasyDrive give you lots of space for very little cash

The mass move to Windows has had one not-so-beneficial effect.  Suddenly,
almost everyone is suffering from a lack of hard disk space.  With operating
systems such as Win95 taking up mucho megabytes on their own, it doesn't take
the installation of too many megabyte-hungry application such as Microsoft
Office (up to 75MB) before you start getting Disk Full messages from your PC.

PCs these days are coming with larger hard disk drives, and replacement drives
have dropped below $400 for a gigabyte drive.  But what do you do if you are
already maxed out in your system?  Most PCs will only support two hard disk
drives.  Unless you want to start transferring files back and forth between
diskettes and/or tape, you have a problem.

Well, you did until recently.  Well-known vendors Iomega and SyQuest have
introduced your solution-ZIP and EZ*DRIVE removable media drives.  Both these
vendors have a long track record in the removable media industry.  SyQuest has
been making high-capacity removable cartridge drives since the Apple II.
Iomega followed suit with its Bernoulli Box for the IBM PC in the early 1980s.
Over the years, both have been somewhat successful, mostly in vertical
industries.  Many of Iomega's sales have been to various branches of the
government and military, where the units' ruggedness is greatly valued, and
the relatively high cost is of secondary concern.  SyQuest has been a big hit
in the publishing industry.  Many publications (including this one) send files
created with page layout software to the printing house on SyQuest cartridges.

But relatively high drive and media prices have kept either company from being
as successful as it might have been.  In 1995, however, both vendors
introduced consumer-oriented, high-capacity storage solutions at affordable
prices.  And sales for both have really taken off.

The ZIP drive, introduced first, is a terrific-looking external drive that
uses a special 3.5-inch, flexible-media, removable disk.  Providing 100MB per
diskette, both the drive, at about $200, and the media, at $20 per 100MB, are
easy on your wallet.  We've been testing the parallel-port version of the ZIP,
and we just love it (the review will be in a future issue).  It seems users
do, too.  The drives have been flying off the shelves, and many vendors have
been backordered almost continuously since the drive started shipping.

This situation has worked out pretty well for SyQuest.  Its EZ*DRIVE is a
comparably priced 135MB cartridge hard disk unit, available in both
parallel-port and SCSI versions (as is the ZIP), and in internal and external
versions (the ZIP is strictly external).  We also have an EZ*DRIVE under
review.  Except for some initial problems installing the SCSI interface, it
also has been a joy to use.

In fact, about the only fly in the ointment with either of these drives is
that Iomega has already announced a bigger and better drive.  Its Jaz drive
should be shipping about the time this appears.  And while we haven't yet seen
one, it's expected to sell for under $500, with 1-gigabyte cartridges costing
about $100 each.  If Iomega does as good a job with the Jaz as it did with the
ZIP, there's no way it (or you) can lose.


Tape backup hits rock bottom

While we're on the topic of additional storage, let's not forget tape backup.
1995 will probably be remembered as the year that tape backup became
affordable enough for even home users.

Tape backup is a technology that's been around almost as long as PCs.  We've
seen it go from the large, clunky 3-M cartridge technology to the tiny DAT
(Digital Audio Tape) format.  One thing has remained constant over the years.
Tape backup has been expensive, slow, and generally a pain to use.

That was then.  The popular QIC format speeded up the backup process.  But it
took inexpensive parallel-port tape

drives to make tape backup an attractive technology.  Prices were falling all
during 1995, but MicroSolutions really hastened the process with an 800MB
Travan-technology capable parallel-port drive for under $170.  Iomega quickly
followed suit with a similar Ditto drive.  Colorado Memory Systems, now owned
by Hewlett-Packard, already has a large chunk of the installed market, with
the lion's share of OEM deals with system vendors.  You can be sure Colorado
won't give up any sales easily to other tape drive vendors.

Just to make things even better, backup software has really improved along
with drive and tape technology.  Arcada Software provides the software for
MicroSolutions and Iomega, and sells an enhanced version on its own.  Other
vendors also have excellent software for backup available.

Just about all of today's backup software offers extensive scheduling options
and various data compression features to squeeze more data onto a single tape.

Sure, we know you already have a tape backup drive on your system.  But
perhaps it's an older unit, with limited capacity.  With today's units, and
today's prices, right now is a good time for you to upgrade.


Accountants on-line

When it comes to technology, accountants generally get a bad rap.  The
stereotype is a green eye-shaded clerk bending over a ledger with a quill pen
in hand.  The reality, as we all know, is much different.  Accountants are
usually quick to embrace a technology once the cost/benefits become clear.
And nowhere is this more evident than in telecommunications, this year's
hottest technology.

Everyone's on the on-line services such as CompuServe and Prodigy.  CompuServe
has long served as a support vehicle for numerous accounting software vendors,
and if you sign onto Prodigy's Special Interest Section, the first listing you
find is one for accountants run by Sid Breman.

The Microsoft Network hasn't been left out either.  F&G, Accounting
Techology's publisher, is a Service Provider on MSN, and you'll find current
and back issues of Accounting Technology as well as its sister publications
The Practical Accountant and Accounting Today.  The Accounting Office, an area
run by Educational Edge, also provides MSN subscribers with access to
accountant-oriented resources.

Even more interesting, however, is how accounting software vendors are among
the leading-edge innovators on the Internet.  SBT, well known for its
accounting software products, has an entire new division with the task of
helping accountants find ways to profit from the Internet.  WebTrader, the
division's first product, offers a secure method for conducting business over
the Net.  Abacus Accounting Systems, another well-known software vendor, is
also heavily into Internet development.

And let's not forget the numerous vendors that have established Web home
pages.  If you have an Internet account, be sure to check out Wayne's Web, the
web "home" of Wayne Harding.  Wayne's the VP of CPA Relations for Great Plains
Software, and his section can be found on Great Plains' Web page
(http://www.gps.com).  If you're an Internet "newbie," Wayne's Web is a good
place to start your Web exploring.


Video conferencing hits the big time:  Here's looking at you, kid

One of the breakthrough technologies in the year just past was video
conferencing.  The basic technology has been available for several years, but
it hasn't made much of a splash because of the incredible amount of resources
needed to make it work.  We've all been reading about PicturePhones, perhaps
the ultimate video-conferencing technology, for years.  And for years, they've
been just around the corner.  Some vendors, such as Casio and Matsushita, have
briefly sold consumer videophones, which sent a single frame of video every
five or ten seconds.  These haven't been successful, as you may as well just
paste a picture of a person you're talking to on the phone.

AT&T has had a bit more success.  If you want to video conference, you can
book some time in a local AT&T center in many major cities and have
full-motion video with other conferencees in similar facilities in other
cities.

The problem is bandwidth.  Video signals, when digitized, comprise a lot of
data.  Normal telephone lines don't have the capability of carrying enough
information in real-time to allow full-motion video to be transmitted.  Even
AT&T has had to go to special dedicated lines for its video-conferencing
services.

This limitation is also felt on the network, but things are changing rapidly.
Today's high-speed Ethernet networks can carry much greater information loads.
And ISDN phone lines are many times faster than standard ones.  Real-time data
compression reduces the amount of information that needs to be transmitted,
while Pentium-level CPUs make it possible to do this compression and
decompression on normal desktop PCs.  Finally, video conferencing is becoming
not just technically feasible, but affordable as well.

While it's not yet an off-the-shelf technology, since it needs somewhat
specialized skills to install and set up, there are some big names getting
into video conferencing.  Intel's ProShare comes in several levels of
capability.  We reviewed the mid-level package, which offers collaboration
over a network, but not video.  With ProShare, video conferencing requires an
ISDN telephone line for each workstation, even if you're conferencing
completely in-house.  Corel's new video-conferencing system only requires an
ISDN line for remote conferencing.  In-house, the video signal is sent over an
unused pair of network wires.

Video conferencing still isn't cheap.  With most of the systems available now,
when all of the costs are tallied up (including a video camera for each
workstation), you can expect to pay in the neighborhood of $1,000 per seat,
with prices expected to drop again this year.  But in a mid-level firm, that's
not all that much money to have instant real-time video conferencing.  It may
even be worthwhile to consider setting up a video-conferencing system between
the firm and its most important clients.  After all, how many other accounting
firms could offer a similar service?


Color inkjets:  Better and even cheaper this year

Okay, we gave these inkjet printers a Diamond last year, so we really weren't
planning on doing it again in '95.  However, we've just finished testing a new
batch of color inkjets, and we have to admit that as impressed as we were last
year, we're even more so this time around.

First off, there are more vendors in the field.  Yes, you can buy an
inexpensive monochrome inkjet, but this class of printers is quickly
disappearing, being replaced by low-cost inkjet printers such as the Epson
Stylus IIs, Lexmark 1020, and HP DeskJet 600.  All of these printers are
"color-capable."  If you replace the monochrome print head with a three-color
unit (cyan, magenta, and yellow), you get full-color output.  The blacks are a
little muddy, since they're comprised of a mixture of the three colors, but
overall the color output looks just great.  And at under $350 (the Lexmark is
under $300), none of these will break the bank.

You'll also have more choices in inexpensive four-color inkjets.  The Canon
BJC-4100 and BJC-600e, HP 660, and Epson Stylus Color II all offer excellent
output on plain paper, and are priced in the $550 price range.  Finally, the
Epson Stylus Color Pro and HP 850 offer great output, good speed, and
office-quality durability for well under $1,000.  For adding color to your
proposals and reports, this is definitely the year of the color inkjet.


Multifunction printer/fax systems:  They dice, they slice

We didn't start out liking multifunction office machines.  The idea isn't bad:
a Swiss-army knife approach of incorporating a printer along with a
scanner/fax machine.  After all, many offices need all of these capabilities,
so why pay for separate machines and give up all of that desktop real estate
when you can put them into one handy package?

When we first looked at this solution, we were less than impressed.  Okidata's
Doc*It, one of the first of the breed, was large, expensive, and required a
separate interface card in your PC.  It worked pretty well, but it definitely
wasn't a machine for the masses.  Panasonic's initial venture into this
market, reviewed in the January 1995 printer round-up, was priced right, but
gave us a bit of difficulty in setup and use.  Both these vendors deserve
kudos for their pioneering efforts.

As with most technology, time has brought improvement.  We're currently
reviewing the new breed of office equipment, and there's been a quantum leap
in what these new units offer.  Hewlett-Packard's Office FX, Canon's
Multipass, and Lexmark's Medley are all inkjet based, and work with plain
paper.  All of them give excellent results, and the Lexmark unit can even
print in color!  Brother's MF-4500 and Panasonic's new unit cost a little
more, but both offer a laser printer, with its additional speed, as the basic
print platform.

Couple attractive packaging, easy setup and use, and reasonable prices (in the
neighborhood of $1,000 for laser-based units, under $700 or so for inkjet
based), and you have a real winner sitting on your desk.


Your desk is alive with the sound of music

Accountants have embraced multimedia with both hands.  And they're not only
using multimedia products, but are creating their own multimedia reports and
presentations.  New presentation packages such as PowerPoint, ASAP, and
Astound have wizards and assistants that take you step by step through the
process.  Pre-designed templates offer just the right background, and OLE
(object linking and embedding) makes it simple to place an "object," such as a
graph, video clip, or even sound file, into your presentation.  There's even a
specialized package from Midisoft called Presentation Partner that makes it
easy to go even further, assembling various multimedia pieces into dynamite
dog and pony shows.

Technology has enabled the average user to incorporate a lot of fairly
esoteric "objects" into everyday presentations.  Video capture boards let you
easily use your camcorder to shoot video clips that just "drop" right into
PowerPoint, Freelance Graphics, or even Word for Windows, using the Insert
Object command.  Lotus ScreenCam makes it possible to capture the action on
your screen while you're running an application.

In fact, about the only place this scenario falls down is on the soundtrack.
A really professional multimedia presentation generally features some sort of
musical accompaniment.  You could just connect your CD or tape player to the
microphone input on your sound card, but that's not really a good solution.
Not only are you stuck with the prerecorded length of the song you're
pirating, but you're also violating someone's copyright.  Sound clip
collections, available on CD-ROM, are a better solution, but they're expensive
and also of fixed length.

A better solution is one of the new soundtrack generators.  Available from
vendors such as Sonic Desktop, Yamaha, and Blue Ribbon Software (recently
acquired by Microsoft), these products let you specify a style (rock, jazz,
swing, reggae, country, etc.), a tempo, and a length, then stitch together a
made-to-order file from musical components.  Each one works a bit differently,
but they all let you adjust the instrument mix to some extent and perform some
degree of blending of musical style when your presentation changes mood.

Obviously, none of these products is as good as having a group of professional
musicians record a custom soundtrack specifically authored for you by a
personal composer.  But even if you have family in the music business, you're
not going to get it done for the under-$200 price tag that all of these
products sport.  And you'll be pleasantly surprised at how good a result you
can achieve with just a little playing around.  It's not essential technology,
but it does let you add a good deal of polish to your presentations at minimal
cost in money and effort.


DOGS

Pentium Overdrive:  Sales shift into reverse

One of Intel's marketing strategies when it was first engineering the
changeover from the 486 to the Pentium was to provide an upgrade path.  Just
as it had enabled you to upgrade 486 CPUs by popping in an "Overdrive" chip,
Intel suggested that system vendors include a spare socket on their 486
motherboards where a Pentium Overdrive chip could be plugged in at a later
time, converting the system to a Pentium-based PC.  Well, it sounded nice in
theory, at least before Intel started shooting its own toes off one at a time.

First came the delays.  With the math problems uncovered in the original
Pentium CPU, you can be sure that Intel wasn't about to bring a replacement
CPU to market with the same flaw.  So that delayed the introduction of the
unit for a while.  (Bang!  There goes one toe.)  Retooling the chip production
lines to produce all the additional Pentiums needed to replace the original
CPUs put the Overdrive project even further behind.  (Bang!  There goes
another.)  Then there was the great socket problem.

When Intel first started pitching the Pentium Overdrive at motherboard
vendors, it specified an upgrade socket based on the pin-out design of the
upgrade chip at that time.  Unfortunately, as the Pentium upgrade project
progressed, the chip was continuously redesigned, and the number of pins that
the chip had was changed.  All of a sudden, the original socket wouldn't work
with the upgrade chip.  (Bang!)  Intel respecified the socket configuration,
and many motherboard and system designers went to a different colored socket.

Even if you are willing to open up your PC before ordering your Pentium
Overdrive and look for the socket (and possibly count the number of holes in
it), you still may not be able to get the right Pentium Overdrive for your
system.  Intel has been very slow in releasing different-speed versions.
(Bang!)  And, assuming you've been lucky enough to find and install the
version for your particular 486 system, you may not have seen the speed
increase you expected, since Intel had to leave off some of the Pentium's
performance features to make it compatible with 486 system design.  (Have we
run out of toes yet?)

There are a few companies that have survived in the system upgrade business.
Evergreen Technologies, Improve, and Kingston still provide modules that let
you wring some additional performance out of your existing 486 at a reasonable
cost.  But at this time last year, there were at least two other companies in
this business; they seem to have gone away since then.  Given Intel's own
experiences, this doesn't seem too surprising.


Novell:  Not so Perfect after all?

Back in the '80's, Novell Corporation was king.  Its NetWare software was the
must-have product if you were serious about having a network.  NetWare is
still the most popular network operating system, but over the years other
products, such as Artisoft's LANtastic and Microsoft's Windows NT, have shown
Novell that it has to work to keep its dominance.

But, riding high with its NetWare success, Novell made some acquisitions that
in retrospect may have done more harm than good.  Its UnixWare division,
intended to make Novell as powerful in the Unix market as it is in DOS, has
come and gone, now residing with SCO.  And WordPerfect, once the king of word
processing and a prized Novell acquisition, is on the block, as is the Quattro
Pro spreadsheet software that Novell acquired from Borland.

It's laudable that a company would want to diversify.  After all, an
essentially one-product company such as Novell is at great risk if that one
product becomes less desirable and/or subject to increased competition.
Novell's big mistakes were buying a company with products that its own
management had no experience with (NetWare isn't a retail product, while
WordPerfect's product line is), and moving too slowly out of the DOS
environment.  WordPerfect may still have the largest number of DOS users of
any product, but who cares.  Like it or not, the world is moving to Windows.

Let's hope Novell's foray into retail applications hasn't done too much
damage.  After all, NetWare is still the standard for networking, and with
less of a drain on its resources, hopefully Novell will become a bit quicker
in addressing some of the challenges that newer Windowing environments offer.
As for WordPerfect and Quattro Pro, it may be that they have peaked and are
now waning.

Tax software vendors:  And another one bites the dust

The year just past was a rough one for tax prep software vendors.  Every year
a few more vendors leave the tax prep market.  Some, such as Prentice-Hall
Professional Software, sell out to another vendor.  In P-H's case, it was
acquired by CLR.  With its own GoSystem and EasyGo products, CLR will most
likely concentrate on the FAST!  audit software it acquired, rather than
expending effort on aging tax prep products that compete with its own.  Two
other vendors, FlashTax and Tax Resources, closed their doors before our
annual 1040 Face-Off over the summer.  Right after our 1040 Face-Off was
completed, a fourth vendor, RAM Software, was acquired by SCS/Compute.

It's pretty inevitable that these won't be the last tax prep vendors to close
their doors.  After all, the professional tax prep market is just about
saturated, with very few new, first-time sales being made.  For a vendor to
gain a new client, it either has to cannibalize some other vendor's user base
or buy out another vendor.  The only other places to generate new business are
out in the retail market, as Intuit is doing with its consumer/retail sales of
business tax products, or moving into entirely new markets, as Pencil Pushers
has done with its CFS services division.

The food chain is a fact of nature.  Big fish eat little fish and are
consumed, in turn, by the next rung up the food chain.  But tax prep vendors
aren't fish; they're people who in many cases have spent an enormous amount of
effort trying to build a business.  Change is an unavoidable part of life, but
we always experience a twinge of sadness when we read about another vendor
passing into the pages of tax prep history.


MIXED BAGS

 ...And sometimes you don't

What we didn't like all that much was Microsoft's Win95 Beta Program.  Billed
as the largest beta test ever, it was plagued by media mismanagement and
deadline pressure.  Once Microsoft decided that it couldn't afford the bad
press that was sure to result if it blew another announced shipping deadline,
the highly touted beta program was mostly for show.  Going through several
"final" release candidates, Microsoft's answer to an inability to solve some
fairly major problems was to pare features out of the operating system.  The
strategy worked; after all, it was able to ship a moderately robust product on
August 24th, as promised.  But it wasn't the product Microsoft initially
intended to ship when beta testing started.

We won't state that Microsoft should have let the deadline slip again to
correct, rather than cut, features it had difficulty getting to work.  After
all, at some point you have to bite the bullet and ship a product, even if it
isn't 100 percent of what you had hoped.  It takes a lot of courage to air
your dirty laundry in public, as Microsoft wound up having to do during its
extensive beta test program of Win95.

What we do take umbrage with is all of the hype that went on with this beta
program.  Not only was Win95 the largest beta test in history, it was unique
in that thousands of copies of beta software were sold as part of Microsoft's
Preview program.  Savvy software vendors such as Symantec's Norton division
jumped right on the bandwagon, with "preview" versions of its Win95 utilities.

Come on, guys.  There's such a thing as carrying things too far!


PentiumPro, not for beginners

Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the computer store, you find
out there's a new big fish in the pond.  Intel has had great success pretty
much killing off the 486 in favor of its Pentium CPU.  But the Pentium is a
couple of years old already, and it's old news.  By the time you read this, a
number of vendors will be advertising, and probably shipping, systems with
Intel's next generation of CPU, the PentiumPro.  The PentiumPro has more
transistors, more cache RAM (moved to a separate chip), and at least on paper,
more power.

But just as was the case when almost every new generation of hardware has been
introduced, the advances in hardware have outstripped most users' ability to
take advantage of them.  Yes, you can use a PentiumPro-equipped PC as a sort
of "super" Pentium.  But only if you are already running 32-bit applications
under a 32-bit operating system such as Windows NT, Win95, or OS/2.  If you
still run mostly 16-bit applications (as most of us do), early benchmarks
indicate that these applications run slower on a PentiumPro than on a Pentium.

Additionally, the early marketing hype on the PentiumPro talked up the
benefits that this new CPU would bring to Asymmetric Multiprocessing.  This
technology uses several CPUs within a system and splits the computational load
between them.  Unfortunately, it's been more difficult to get this technology
working reliably than the vendors had anticipated.  Even with the highly
touted PentiumPro.

Make no mistake about it.  Intel will be successful with the PentiumPro CPU,
just as it has been with its other CPU products in the past.  It just won't
happen overnight.  The Pentium CPU, which will achieve speed of 150s and 175
MHz this year, is still going to be the CPU of preference for a while.


IBM 1-2-3?

And, as long as we're talking about strange acquisitions, let's not forget
IBM's 3 billion dollar purchase of Lotus.  You've got to admire IBM; it's a
company that's succeeded in spite of itself.  First there was the IBM PC, a
product that none of IBM's top management at the time believed would sell.
When it took off like a rocket, quickly becoming the standard for desktop
computing, IBM made a series of incredible design decisions.  Remember the
PCjr?  How about IBM's version of the Compaq transportable?  The P70?  And who
can forget the MCA (Micro Channel Architecture) bus?

As incredible as it may seem with this track record, IBM still manages to make
lots of money.  When you're that big, it takes an awful lot to throw you off
the course.  At the same time, Big Blue doesn't exactly have a stellar record
in applications software either.  How many of you remember TopView, IBM's
answer to the original Windows?  The IBM Accounting Series?  Hollywood?  Were
you even aware that IBM started up a PC software division, acquired marketing
rights to a number of products, then closed down the division?

And who else but IBM could consider OS/2 a hit?  Sure, it really is a great
operating system, and it has shipped a couple of million copies, about what
Win95 shipped in the first month of availability.  Even IBM provides Windows
on its Aptiva PCs that it sells through Radio Shack.

With this string of software successes behind it, it kind of makes sense that
IBM would want Lotus.  After all, Lotus has the tremendously successful 1-2-3,
which will hopefully be available for Win95 by the time you read this.  Then
there's AmiPro, oops, we mean WordPro, the hit word-processing package.

We admit it, we're being mean.  Accountants still use 1-2-3, probably more
than any other specific user group.  But how many are buying the newest
version when they go looking for an upgrade?  1-2-3 has steadily given ground
to Excel as Windows has become the operating system of choice.  It's possible
for a product to go into a slide and recover, but it doesn't happen often.
Most of the other Lotus applications, such as Freelance Graphics, are also
being overtaken by products from other vendors.

But it's a good bet that IBM really wanted Lotus for the wildly successful
Notes product.  Notes is the premier groupware product on the market today,
and it almost single-handedly set many of the standards for workflow office
products.  But the paradigm has changed with the popularity of the Internet.
Notes was designed around (and optimized for) a network environment.  The
Internet is sort of a super wide-area network, and the current version of
Notes doesn't work as well with it as some other technologies.  You can be
sure IBM is working on it; it's got a lot of strength and experience in
client-server technology, which is one of the bases of the Internet.

Having many of Lotus's top management people take a hike after the acquisition
can't be helping matters, however.  Notes is a "big company" kind of product.
Lots of "big companies" have made large investments in Notes technology, so
there's a very strong reason for IBM to make a commitment to keeping the
momentum going with the product.

The downside is that technology changes quickly; witness the Internet.  And
while momentum can often be good, it also makes it difficult to change
directions quickly.

Will Notes (and Lotus) survive the IBM approach?  Right now the acquisition is
a Mixed Bag.  But it could go either way this year.


Color lasers:  Set lasers on intermittent

On paper, a color laser printer is almost irresistible.  For around $6,000, or
not quite twice what one of the original LaserJet printers sold for, you get
the best of both worlds.  When you need black and white, your printer zooms
out a speedy 12 pages per minute.  And, when there's a client presentation or
report to do, gorgeous color pages flow from the printer, on plain paper, at 3
pages per minute.  With competition for clients getting fiercer by the minute,
even that six grand price tag doesn't seem all that imposing, measured against
the print-on-demand capabilities offered by one of the new color lasers.
Color inkjets are terrific, but ah, for a color laser!

That's the way it would work if a color laser was as easy to use out of the
box as regular monochrome lasers are.  That hasn't been our experience,
however.  When a major vendor of color lasers offered us the opportunity last
year to look at its latest model, we jumped at the chance.  Weighing in at
over 100 pounds, it took two of us to unpack it and move it into position, and
a fair amount of time to set it up.  Mechanically, with four different color
toners (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black), these printers are more complex
than a single-color laser.  Even this setup, though somewhat time-consuming,
isn't beyond the abilities of most potential users.

But in several months of testing, we ran into problem after problem.  Flaky
drivers for Windows and Windows NT drove us nuts.  Problems with long print
jobs were also disconcerting.  Sometimes the job printed in its entirety,
sometimes the same job printed halfway through, then started spewing pages of
PostScript code.  The vendor's technical support was helpful, but in the end
we decided that we had experienced just too many problems to continue our
review.  Thanking the vendor, we offered to come back at a later time for
another look.

We have another vendor's color laser currently under review at the moment.
This is a new product, and the vendor has a strong background in providing
terrific software drivers.  We won't mention the vendor since we want some
more experience before we decide on a full-scale review, but so far, so good.
We've been running Windows 3.11 drivers under Win95 with no problems yet.  The
next step is to try networking the unit and moving it between a number of
different PCs.  At over 100 pounds (all color lasers are heavy!), this won't
be easy, but we want to make sure that this unit doesn't have the same
problems we ran into with the last printer.  If it doesn't, than you can
expect a review soon, and maybe in next year's Diamonds and Dogs, we can
change the Mixed Bag into a Diamond.

Financial Planners' Secrets of Success


After 10 years of grinding out monthly financial statements and tax returns,
Peggy Ruhlin shut down her CPA practice to go into financial planning.  And
she never looked back.  At the height of the next season, she called her
harried friends at the old firm.  "I'm going skiing," she told them.  "What
are you doing?"  She could almost hear their teeth gnashing.  "I went on two
vacations during that first tax season.  It was wonderful."

Since then, Ruhlin has built a major financial planning practice, Boudros &
Ruhlin, in Columbus, Ohio.  Boudros & Ruhlin manages about $250 million in
client funds, making it a major discount broker's biggest operator in the
region.

And she is not alone.  More and more tax and accounting professionals, many of
them CPAs, are getting into financial planning.  Some enter the field by
accident, pushed by faithful

clients seeking help as they enter their most fruitful years.  Others are
pulled by the huge promise of an exploding market of monied but fretful
baby-boomers.

Different Challenges.  To be sure, the typical fee-only financial planning
firm remains as small a business as the average tax and accounting practice.
Industry sources say most offices have one owner, who may net about $75,000 a
year, and one assistant.  About 25 percent of the financial planners are
women, a much higher level of ownership than in accounting.  Few practices
will have more than $10 million in funds under management, priced at a 1% fee
or less.

But freed from billing by the hour, a practitioner's income is limited only by
his or her ability to develop clients.  Fees based on a percentage of assets
under management can rise with little or no incremental costs, meaning every
new dollar falls straight to the bottom line.  In a bull market year, every
tick upward in the Standard & Poor's index is another clang of the asset
manager's cash register.  "When the S&P is up 25%," said one practitioner,
"clients don't notice the 1% annual charge."

"If your target market is small business and professionals," says CPA Bob
Phillips, "you end up dealing with financial planning issues whether you like
it or not."  Phillips is one of eight partners at the CPA firm of Whipple &
Co., which, with 60 people and revenue of more than $5 million, is one of the
10 largest firms in Indianapolis.

In his firm, Phillips is the one charged with the mission of building the
financial planning practice.  "We decided years ago to help our clients plan
their personal lives as systematically as we do their businesses," he says.
As a result, Phillips is now playing an active role in his clients' investment
decisions and portfolio structuring.

But serious financial planning work, which always involves actual investment
decisions and execution, is much different from traditional estate planning.
The leading financial planners, whether they work on commission or on
fee-only, relish their roles as active players.  They share a desire to be
more than a mere advisor.  They also cherish the challenge of making
investment decisions, choosing products and running money.

People-Oriented Focus.  Many traditional CPAs and tax professionals just don't
have the constitution for it.  "There's a lot more uncertainty in this work,"
says Phillips.  "All of a sudden, you are much more accountable for a lot of
things you can't control."

"You have to be very people-oriented," adds CPA Cynthia Conger.  "It's a lot
more difficult for the technical types to get into the counseling aspects of
this work."  Conger, now one of two principals in the Arkansas Financial
Group, in Little Rock, earned her CPA certificate in 1981, using it first as a
corporate controller and later in insurance sales.  She started full-blown,
comprehensive financial planning in 1985 with an associate from the insurance
agency.

At first, she shunned tax returns.  But bending to client demand, today
Conger's Arkansas Financial Group handles about 175 tax customers a year,
including corporate and fiduciary forms.  Her firm also handles accounting at
six to eight small businesses.  But the core of the business is the 250 to 300
financial plans she writes a year and the $35 million in assets under
management.  Eventually, she and her partner plan to launch a trust company to
administer all the trusts they've put in place for clients.  But before that,
Conger may launch a line of administrative services for individuals, to handle
routine bill-paying and banking chores, which could be invoiced monthly.  "We
deal with a lot of double-doctor households who just don't have the time to do
this kind of thing," she says.

Gary Shalhoob, a Dallas financial planner, agrees.  "CPAs need a much broader
perspective as a financial planner," says Shalhoob.  "You have to weigh not
only the estate and tax consequences, but also the investment ramifications as
well."  Shalhoob developed financial planning units first at Bank of America
and then at Deloitte & Touche and Price Waterhouse before starting his own
firm, Resource Management Group.  He is also a contributing author to "Tax &
Financial Planning for Older Clients," issued by Practitioners Publishing Co.
of Fort Worth, Texas, an affiliate of Faulkner & Gray Inc.

Today Shalhoob works with CPAs, trading referrals, convinced that Big
Six-sized financial planning practices are not economically sensible.  "This
is not a business you can build on leverage," he says.  "All the service is
very personal, nothing can be delegated."  But firms are also limited in their
range of movement.  They might be reluctant to recommend specific stocks or
financial companies, if they are involved as auditors.  Mixing audit clients
and financial planning clients can also complicate carefully groomed
relationships.  "One bad year in the market for a CFO could blow your audit
contract," Shalhoob says.  And, with a big firm's overhead, pricing is a
problem if you can't work on commission.  "Anyone trying to do fee-only
financial planning has a very difficult time making money," Shalhoob says.

So, many CPA financial planners do what Ron Humeney has done.  Humeney, a
Southfield, Mich., CPA, runs two businesses-Starfire Financial, to handle tax
preparation, and Starfire Investment Advisory Sevices, to sell products and
manage assets.  If they are unfettered by CPA regulations, they might do what
Ed Gerstein and Gregg Fisher have done.  Gerstein ran a Brooklyn, N.Y., tax
practice solo until two years ago when he brought nephew Gregg into the
business.  Today, Gerstein crunches tax returns for about 1,500 clients, while
Fisher is attempting to leverage that database into a financial planning
practice.

This Just In:  Getting Back to Business


If you cringe every time you hear another Congressperson say how great it
would be if only everybody paid a flat tax, it's time for you to investigate
options in business tax preparation.  Compared to the near-universal griping
that goes on about the 1040 individual tax, few politicians are getting much
sound bite time on the evening news if they propose axing corporation taxes.
Sharpening your practice's focus on business tax clients could help save it
from rough times in 1997.

Perhaps in anticipation of greater demand for professional business tax
products next year, software vendors are beefing up their 1065, 1120, and
1120S lines with more capabilities this year.  Even if your firm already has a
solid foundation of business tax clients and the software to service them, you
may want to consider where your current vendor is heading compared to others
in the industry.  We checked with them to find out what their plans are for
the software they'll be shipping this season.

Alpine climbs every mountain

Alpine Data is packing more features into its 1995 Tax/Pack Professional
business modules.  You'll be able to access a preparer scratchpad from any
screen, so you can take notes on a client whose return you're preparing.  Also
more accessible will be the pop-up calculator, which you'll be able to bring
up from within any field.  And a new monthly calendar utility will be popping
up as well.

Alpine is also leaving room for your laser forms software.  It offers a laser
fill feature that lets you view and enter data on laser forms that aren't
included in the Tax/Pack software.  Tax/Pack will then save the data that you
type in to a separate area from the business return data.

Form 1120 customers will now be getting a full billing module.  And Alpine
plans to add the billing module to its 1065 and 1120S products as well.

AM wake-up call

It's morning in America, and AM Software is already enhancing its business tax
software for the coming season.  Whereas the AM-Tax LaserForms product was an
optional add-on last year, this year AM is including it with its 1065, 1120,
and 1120S programs.  But despite bundling the laser software, AM isn't
ignoring other types of printers.  It has improved its graphical printing
features, so you can get official-looking forms on inkjet and dot-matrix
printers without resorting to special fonts or extra software.

Networked offices will now be able to enjoy network compatibility with AM-Tax,
so multiple users can share data files while keeping their own system
settings.  AM has also simplified data entry by offering convenient pick lists
on certain forms.  You'll be able to access them by pressing a function key,
choose the entry you want, point to it, and the program will enter your choice
into the field.

Lower renewal prices will please existing customers.  They're down 20 percent
to $129.  And to go along with the new network compatibility, you can add
extra AM-Tax stations for only 20 percent of the original, first-computer
software price.

More pluses for Andersen

Arthur Andersen LLP is showing its Big 6 muscle with enhancements to its A
Plus business tax line.  A Plus Tax 1120 and 1065 are gaining per-return
pricing and more comprehensive calculations.  You'll also see interfaces to
the AICPA's ATB (Accountant's Trial Balance) and Andersen's own electronic
workpapers products.

For 1065 users, Andersen is providing a special allocations worksheet, as well
as inter-product transfers of K-1 data.  The K-1's will automatically print
with the 1040, saving time for A Plus Tax 1040 users.  Also saving time will
be a direct interface to CD-ROM tax research products like CCH U.S.  Master
Tax Guide, RIA OnPoint, and BNA Tax Practice Series.

Andersen has tinkered with the A Plus interface as well, consolidating screens
and improving screen and application flow.  A multimedia training course will
be available.  And on the boards for next year is a Windows version.

If you're in the tax department of a large corporation or have large corporate
clients, also check out the brand-new Windows-based AACTS (Arthur Andersen
Corporate Tax Solutions) line.  Aimed at corporations with multiple entities
or multiple filing responsibilities, it will handle federal and state tax
compliance, and prepare the 1120.  AACTS will integrate with other Windows
applications, by using facilities like DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange), so it can
update data from other Windows apps in real-time.

One product in the AACTS line, DataOnDemand, will establish dynamic links
between an Excel spreadsheet and your corporate tax information.  Another
product, AACTS Real-Time Tax, will integrate with high-end general ledger
applications such as SAP and Oracle; it will also include support for SQL
(Structured Query Language) and ODBC (Open Data Base Connectivity) standards.
A third product, AACTS-International Planning, will let you build complex tax
scenarios over multiple-year periods, such as calculating dividends and loans
from foreign subsidiaries.  It's a whole new aact for Arthur Andersen.

ATX enhances the spreadsheet

ATX Forms has enhanced its TaxSolver line of spreadsheet-based tax prep
software by adding a Windows-based forms program.  The result is ATX's new
Saber line.  Unlike TaxSolver, which required you to combine the ATX templates
with either 1-2-3 or Excel, Saber cuts out the need for third-party software
by including a built-in spreadsheet program.  Saber also provides an audit
trail, along with the ability to create formulas and write directly on the tax
forms.

ATX sells its 1065, 1120, and 1120S programs in several ways.  Each return is
available in a Basic version for $49, and a Professional version for $99.  The
Basic version includes a few of the most important supporting forms and
schedules, along with extension and depreciation worksheets.  The Professional
version provides more than 100 supporting forms and schedules, together with
the ability to create client letters and invoices.

In addition, bundled packages are available for preparing the 1065, 1120, and
1120S, along with other types of forms.  A basic version of this bundle,
called Business Basic, sells for $149.  The Professional version costs $295.

CCH proves it's a pro

CCH is upgrading the Windows version of its ProSystem fx 1065, 1120, and 1120S
programs by adding interfaces to general ledger and time and billing products.
Also being added to the 1120S product is an interface to CCH Tax Assistant for
S Corporations, a practice management system with research, analysis, and
compliance features.

Installation and printing will also be on the upswing in ProSystem fx.

GoSystem keeps going and going...

CLR/Fast-Tax's GoSystem 2 is really going places in both its DOS and Windows
versions.  The system now supports fast 28,800 bits per second transmission
speeds for electronic filing, and CLR will be offering NetWare 4.1 and Windows
95 support as well this season.

The 1065 program for DOS and Windows will let you perform multiple partner
transfers on the same day.  And it will handle transfers with capital
contributions and distributions while using the same locator, as well as do
transfers for more than five excluded partners.

The 1120 software for DOS and Windows will offer an express consolidation
feature to speed up consolidation time.  You'll also be able to delete rental
properties.  In addition, CLR has reorganized the rent and royalty input, and
will be enhancing the 1120 program's list of activity codes.  The program will
summarize state tax liabilities and supply a common input for state
intangibles.

The Windows version alone has several enhancements.  It now offers
administrative functions that used to be found only in the DOS version.  The
View menu will include a Received Date option.  And CLR is going to be
providing a Windows version of its TaxServer product and will support a
Windows Portable Organizer.

Upcoming hyperlink capabilities in the Windows product will add hyperlinks to
fields, as well as "direct to organizer" hyperlinks.  Workpapers will allow
overrides, DIF import and export, and hyperlinking by field.

Also on the way are better navigation capabilities, including a File
Manager-like expanding folder metaphor.  You'll be able to customize menus
with activity descriptions, toggle menus on or off, bring up a new "active
forms" view, and edit and format customized letters for all return types.
Lots of changes are coming for GoSystem users.

Digitax does graphics

Cold River Software has been promoting its Windows-based 1040 software,
Veritax, for the past couple of seasons.  But even its DOS-based tax product,
Digitax Business Returns, is getting some graphical enhancements.  The 1065,
1120, and 1120S programs will be offering graphically enhanced supporting
schedules and letters.  Also going graphical are the manuals.  They'll be
available in both printed form and in a printable, searchable Adobe Acrobat
electronic format.

Cold River's also moving toward better technical support.  A 24-hour FaxBack
service is now available, as well as a home page on the Internet's World Wide
Web.  Surf the Cold River rapids at http://www.cold-river.com.

CPAS makes new converts

CPASoftware's business tax software is undergoing a conversion for the
upcoming filing season.  You'll be able to convert entities from 1120 to
1220S, or 1120S to 1120.  And CPAS is not only converting its 1120, it's
consolidating it as well.  You'll be able to consolidate up to 10 corporations
with the 1120, as well as prepare supplementals for the first four pages of
your consolidations, along with supplementals for applicable forms, schedules,
and supplemental schedules, such as the 4562, Schedule D, and other income.

In addition to conversion, salvation is at hand.  CPAS's new archiving
features let you save tax returns, input detail, workpapers, and other files
in a compressed format.  CPAS is passing the silver platter too by offering
access to CD-ROM research material.  State clicks will be another new option,
allowing you to buy use of a state package one return at a time (similar to
the pay-per-return concept).

Speaking of states, you'll be able to compute up to five states with a single
compute.  New states joining the CPAS flock include Arizona, California, New
York, and Texas for the 1120.  Entering the 1120S fold will be California, New
York, Ohio, Texas, and Wisconsin, and new 1065 states for Arizona, California,
New Jersey, and New York.  Only one new city return will be added to the 1065,
1120, and 1120S, but it's a big one:  New York City.

Creating the Ultrabusiness

Creative Solutions is building a better business solution for this coming
season.  It's adding 10 new states to its 1120/1120S package, UltraTax/1120,
upping its coverage to 31 states for both C and S corps.  In UltraTax/1065, 13
new states are joining the Union, for a grand total of 23.  These new programs
will be available on the UltraTax CD-ROM and as pay-per-return options.
UltraTax/1120 is also gaining a two-year comparison and calculation to support
the IRC Section 1377 (a)(2) election for termination of a shareholder
interest.

A new feature to speed data entry to the ultra-quick level will be an Index of
Tax Subjects that helps you locate the proper section of the appropriate data
entry screen when you're not quite sure where to input a particular item.
You'll also be able to generate custom selection lists of commonly used items
specific to your area, such as local banks.

Drake makes good

Drake Software will let you print all its forms in either laser or dot-matrix
mode this season.  You'll be able to access on-line help for almost every data
entry field, and written documentation will be improved.  Over 35 federal
forms will be available.  Drake will also offer a new pay-per-return option,
priced at $250 for up to 20 returns per computer, and $10 apiece for
additional returns.

Dunphy does it

Dunphy Systems' federal 1120 program will offer support this season for Form
1120-W (Estimated Tax for Corporations), with a three-page quarterly
worksheet.  And Dunphy will provide Ohio users with a new quarterly look-up
table for county personal property rates in its Ohio FT1120/FT1120S package.
Michigan users too will be seeing some enhancements.  The new Michigan Single
Business Tax (SBT) program will support all 17 forms for that tax, including
extensions, estimates, and amended returns.  You'll also be able to import
company and shareholder information into the Michigan SBT from other federal
programs, such as Dunphy's 1040, 1065, 1120, and 1120S software.  The Michigan
SBT will even include laser forms software, so you can make official-looking
printouts for your Michigan business clients.

Exactax minds its business

Exactax has been integrating software from the Business Tax Service of New
York with its own system, and this season will be offering a trial balance
worksheet input system.  You'll be able to input information through a trial
balance income statement and balance sheet into the Business Tax System, so
you can complete the books and use the year-end trial balance, instead of
converting book data into tax return format.

Other enhancements will include automated multiple-state processing, along
with new state returns for Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware,
District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New
Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Virginia.  Exactax
is also making its supporting schedules and instruction letters easier to
read, and its estimated tax section more comprehensive and automatic.  The
program will compute Section 277 Co-op Housing figures, and will offer more
flexibility when you enter detail on a Schedule K-1.

Business Tax System will provide comprehensive net operating loss and
contribution carryover schedules, along with more comprehensive financial
statements, such as the statement of cash flows, interim financial statements,
and sole proprietor (Schedule C) financial statements.  You'll be able to
generate a financial statement from the book data you enter to create a tax
return.

In addition, the system will automatically print the original extension form
for each return that you have on extension.  And it will handle unlimited
K-1's and rental income, as well as comprehensively report rental detail for
each K-1.  You'll be able to prepare automatic book/tax adjustments for items
such as depreciation, amortization, contributions, entertainment, penalties,
officers life insurance, federal income tax, Section 263A, and automobile
lease inclusion.  Exactax will offer expanded customer service hours, from 6
am to 7 pm Pacific time (or 9 am to 10 pm Eastern time).  That should match
many accounting firms' regular hours this tax season.

Intuit pursues two markets

For tax year 1995, Intuit is making a big push to upgrade its business tax
products, for professional tax preparers and small-business taxpayers alike.
A new Homebase feature in the professional software will provide convenient
access to client files and main program functions (such as printing and
transferring).  You'll be able to access the entire TurboTax ProSeries line
from the Homebase as well, and generate any number of copies you want of forms
and schedules for inclusion with your clients' returns.

ProSeries/1120 for Windows will offer an ACE depreciation worksheet.  Fifteen
new states will join the corporate business return list:  Colorado,
Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan
SBT, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and
Wisconsin.  Client files will be interchangeable with the DOS version.  And
pull-down pick lists will be available for certain fields, such as business
codes and depreciation methods.

ProSeries/1120S for Windows will add a shareholder's basis worksheet that
automatically gets amounts from the Schedule K-1 worksheets.  You'll be able
to have an unlimited number of K-1's, and Intuit has improved both K-1 input
sheets and data entry.  Thirteen new states have been recruited to the 1120S
team:  Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New
Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin.

Meanwhile, partnerships haven't been overlooked by Intuit.  ProSeries/1065 for
Windows supports unlimited K-1's and the new K-1 input sheets, as well as
interchangeable client files with the DOS version.  Seven new partnership
states include Florida, Georgia, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and
Pennsylvania.  Furthermore, the California Limited Liability (CA 568) company
return will be available this season, and it will read and transfer data from
the 1065 program.

Intuit isn't stopping there with business tax software.  As discussed in this
issue's Editor's Note, it's also bringing out TurboTax for Business.  This
$79.95 product will enable small-business owners to prepare their own 1065,
1120, and 1120S returns.  As with the personal version of the 1040 product,
TurboTax for Business will include tax advice and tax planning suggestions.
Complete IRS instructions and full-text versions of IRS publications for small
businesses (as well as the text of a book called "Tax Savvy for Small
Business" by tax attorney Fred Daily) will be available on-line, and the help
facility will be context sensitive.

TurboTax for Business will use an interview approach to take taxpayers through
the preparation process.  It can import accounting data from QuickBooks and
Quicken, and will provide automatic error checking and tax-saving tips while
preparing a return.  Intuit will be offering 49 Windows state modules, sold
separately.  After TurboTax for Business prepares a return, it will go back
and check for omissions and errors, and alert users to possible audit items.
In addition, Intuit will be bundling Netscape's Navigator with the package, so
taxpayers will be able to access the new TurboTax home page on the World Wide
Web (http://www.intuit.com/TurboTax) to get tech support, tax advice and
information, and state software.  MacInTax for Business will also be available
for Mac users.

Lacerte adds up

Lacerte Software is adding more forms, features, and states to its
professional tax prep line.  New to its 1120 program, for example, is Form
1120W, the Estimated Tax Worksheet.  And joining the Lacerte 1120 states will
be Delaware, Kansas, Missouri, and Utah.

In the Form 1120S program, you'll be able to print K-1 instructions, as well
as collated copies of Schedule K-1, the shareholder transmittal letter, and
K-1 instructions.  When preparing S Corp returns, you'll have the opportunity
to calculate the excess net passive income tax, and print certain election
statements for S Corps.  New 1120S states will include Florida, Kansas,
Missouri, and Utah.

For the 1065 program, Lacerte will now print Schedule K-1 instructions, along
with the contents of the client letter.  States will follow the example of the
federal program on the invoice setup; partnership states will allow for
billing per state K-1, so you'll have an additional option besides billing in
a lump sum.  The Additional K-1's printing option will include a Schedule K-1
collation routine, with three new global user options and three new override
codes that you can make specific for your clients.  When you get to the end of
a return and set the Additional K-1's to generate a specific number of copies,
the program will print the Schedule K-1 Transmittal Letter, federal Schedule
K-1, federal Schedule K-1 instructions, the state Schedule K-1 (or a
Lacerte-generated Partner Summary), and (when required) the state Schedule K-1
instructions.  You can then distribute them to as many partners and members in
your firm as you please.

The new Jumptopartner routine doesn't necessarily put you on the fast track to
promotion in your firm.  But it does let you jump back and forth between
partners in all of the 1065 program's Special Allocation screens.  Even when
you jump in this way, the cursor and line position will stay the same as in
the last entry, making it more convenient to enter special allocations.  This
routine won't replace other input methods; it's simply one more handy-dandy
feature provided by Lacerte.  Also new to the 1065 will be state returns for
Florida, Kansas, Missouri, and Utah.

For 1065, 1120, and 1120S programs, new enhancements will include book
depreciation schedules that let you enter and track depreciation for book
purposes.  You'll also have the ability to print different numbers of copies
of depreciation schedules for 1995 and 1996 regular tax, AMT, and book
purposes.  Lacerte will also let you amend prior-year returns as well as
override "corrected" amounts.  There's power for you:  the ability to change
history.  Also new for this coming season in all the programs are slip sheets
and filing instructions.

Laser surgery

Laser Systems is powering up its TaxWorks Corporation 1120, S Corporation
1120S, and Partnership 1065 Business Systems for next season.  All three
programs will generate financial statements that are prepared on an income tax
basis.  You'll also be able to print a customizable letter to accompany the
statements.  When you update clients from last year, you'll have the option of
carrying the ending balance sheet detail information over to the current
year's beginning balance sheet fields.

Three new options will be available to smooth out K-1 processing and printing.
These will let you process, view, and print returns with or without the K-1
information included.

In all the Business Systems will be a new General Information screen.  And
Laser Systems has standardized the format of the date, Social Security, and
Employer Identification Number fields.

In addition, Laser Systems is adding electronic filing to the 1065 System.
For the 1120 System, a new Federal Net Operating Loss Worksheet and Charitable
Contribution Worksheet will help you keep track of NOL and charitable
contribution deduction and carryover figures.  Lastly, the 1120 System is
getting Form 1120X.  X marks the spot for TaxWorks development.

Corporate relief

Micro Vision Software is integrating its 1120 and 1120S software, Tax Relief
CORP, with other vendors' software to improve these programs' productivity.  A
general ledger link will let you import data from major client write-up and
general ledger programs.  The software will also link with Microsoft Excel and
Timeslips.  And the company recently purchased Summit Software, another
business tax software developer.

New states for the Windows version of Tax Relief CORP will include New Jersey
and New York.  For DOS users, new states are Colorado, Delaware, Georgia,
Ohio, and Texas.  Through a third-party developer, it's providing DOS users
with integrated state programs for Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, District of
Columbia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine,
Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire,
New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina,
Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.

For 1065 DOS users, Tax Relief PART is adding two new state programs developed
by Micro Vision, California and New Jersey.  And through a strategic
partnership, DOS users will be getting access to more state programs that
integrate with Micro Vision's own DOS-based software.  These will include
Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma,
Oregon, S.  Carolina, W.  Virginia, and Wisconsin.

For all its Tax Relief products, Micro Vision has added the ability to dial
into its bulletin board from within the program so you can download
corrections and get questions answered.  Client files will be fully
interchangeable between the DOS and Windows software, and Tax Relief for
Windows will also be compatible with both the DOS and Windows state modules.
You'll be able to change your data path from the activate screen, and Micro
Vision is adding expanded fields throughout the software, along with more
detailed diagnostic messages.  Finally, Tax Relief products will be available
on CD-ROM with either an unlimited use license or on a pay-per-return basis.

Pencil Pushers gets to the point

The Damirus Corp., which makes Pencil Pushers Tax Software, is focusing most
of its development efforts on a future Windows product and on shipping its DOS
product bug-free and on time.  In the meantime, for this tax season, it's
adding a Florida corporate return to its business tax line, along with a few
unusual business credit forms.

SCS/Compute advances on both fronts

SCS/Compute is enhancing both its Tax Machine and LMS Tax lines.  For Tax
Machine, you'll be able to print K-1 labels for partners, shareholders, and
beneficiaries.  New state modules will include Louisiana, Mississippi, and New
Mexico.  One new city module, a Philadelphia S Corporation return, will also
be available.  Tax Machine will be released on CD-ROM, and you'll be able to
link the program to other accounting products, such as SCS's own DataWrite and
the AICPA's ATB.  Or you can use Audisys's TAXi to import accounting
information into Tax Machine.

For LMS Tax Business Programs, SCS will be offering simplified data entry
screens and input forms for the 1065, 1120, and 1120S.  You'll be able to
print mailing labels for each K-1 in the partnership and S-Corp returns.  SCS
is improving LMS's link to DataWrite and ATB, and offering TAXi for importing
data from other accounting applications.

TaascFORCE is up to the task

Tax and Accounting Software Corp.  (TaascFORCE) is building a better
Professional Tax System.  This coming season, it will be providing a free
Practice Manager that generates specialized client lists and sorted mailing
labels.  Other new extras will include file compression, the ability to create
an itemized schedule for any input field, carryforward of specified state
information from last year's state returns, and support for up to 999
depreciable assets.

New states for the 1065, 1120, and 1120S products will include Alabama,
Arkansas, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Louisiana, and New Mexico.  New
forms on the roster will be 1120A (Corporation Short Form), 1120X (Corporation
Amended Return), 2848 (Power of Attorney), 8271 (Tax Shelter Registration
Number), 8586 (Low Income Housing Credit), 8822 (Change of Address), and TD F
90-22 1 (Foreign Bank Accounts).

On the 1120S and 1065, TAASC has enhanced the Schedule K-1 in several ways.
The software will automatically handle special allocations, let you select
which shareholder or partner K-1's to adjust for rounding, and print
shareholder/partner numbers on each K-1.

In addition, the Professional Tax System will be able to convert existing C
Corp data to an S Corp return, and will add a new field where you can enter
the title of your firm's signing officer.  The transmittal letter for the
partnership state programs will offer paragraphs about the tax due and
estimated tax.  And Form 4684 will now support multiple casualty dates.  Next
tax season will be less of a casualty with TAASC on the job.

TaxByte does more

TaxByte will be expanding the depreciation capabilities of its Tax
Commissioner business tax products, increasing depreciation capacity from 250
assets to 450.  A trial balance import feature is also new, along with an
enhanced direct data input system, and more automatic calculations.  TaxByte
has also added general letters and customizable, client-specific letters for
each K-1, along with an enhanced, automated invoice feature that does updates
for time and billing.

In the 1120 package, there will be a net operating loss carryforward feature
from prior years.  Tax Commissioner will also carry over depreciation from the
1040 version into the business tax products and perform conversions from one
entity to another, such as for a C Corporation that becomes an S Corp.  Lots
of transitions are underway in the business tax arena, and Tax Commissioner
will be policing them.

TAX$IMPLE builds up

TAX$IMPLE's 1995 Business Tax Programs are looking to 1995 and beyond.
They'll include a three-year comparative summary report and will automatically
generate supporting schedules.  You'll be able to do year-to-year transfers
for all your balance sheets, worksheets, and supporting schedules.  TAX$IMPLE
will also support RAM drives, and will let you transfer business K-1's
directly into the TAX$IMPLE 1040 program.  The business programs are also
gaining Forms 851, 1120X, 1139, 4466, 8810, the 1120-A short form, Schedule H,
and Schedule A for Form 1120-W.

Mouse support is also on schedule for this season, along with enhanced
printing features.  You'll be able to choose specific forms and the number of
copies per form to print, as well as print state and federal forms in
combination.  Text for 22 topics will be available for your transmittal or
cover letters.  You'll be able to say plenty with TAX$IMPLE.

TenKey has it together

TenKey will be offering four business tax programs in one this season.  Tax
Shop Entities will contain 1120, 1120S, 1065, and 1041 programs in the same
package, together with laser software and a depreciation program.  The
software will be available for Windows (with Windows 95 compatibility) this
season, and you'll be able to transfer data from the DOS program to the
Windows version.

The Windows version will also include all the features in the DOS program,
such as built-in electronic mail and communications.  This allows access to
TenKey's on-line Problems Resolution Database, which gets updated with each
message received from an on-line user.

Pennsylvania will be joining the entire Tax Shop Entities state roster, and to
just the 1065 software TenKey is also adding California, Illinois, and New
York.  In addition, a third-party add-on program, TAXi Tax Import Bridge, will
be available to import data from other vendors' general ledger and client
write-up software into Tax Shop Entities.

Growing Universal

Universal Tax Systems is improving its TaxWise business tax software with a
galaxy of new options.  You'll be able to print a mailing label with your tax
returns or from the Query Database Screen.  The program will highlight
incomplete forms in red.  You'll also be able to invoke the 1120, 1120S, and
1065 modules without exiting to DOS.  The program will flag estimated amounts,
so you'll be able to distinguish them from your actual data.  Universal will
also let you order federal and state 1065, 1120, and 1120S programs from the
same CD-ROM platter as the 1040 and 1041.

New for this season are 18 state business modules, bringing TaxWise's total to
23 states:  Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia,
Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, New
Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina,
Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Wisconsin.  In addition, you'll have the
ability to print out as many blank forms as necessary for a client.

New menu options will enable you to apply updates, install state software,
copy master forms and macros from one user to another, batch your problem
returns together for transmission to Universal's service bureau, shell to DOS,
and install soft fonts.  Universal will also be offering a conversion program
from its 1040 product to do a prior-year carryforward of client data.

In addition to these new features, Universal is enhancing some old ones.  The
business modules will include customized database and diagnostic screens.
Mailing labels will be able to contain phone numbers.  You'll be able to query
the database to learn the amount of a fee deposit, and access a scratchpad and
check information when you've printed more than a single check.  The client
letter has improved to allow for multiple letters, letterhead paper,
signatures, refund or balance-due amounts, and if-then logic for which
paragraphs to include.  The depreciation worksheet has also been enhanced,
letting you access a new spreadsheet while TaxWise is displaying a list of
existing assets.  It will let you compute next year's depreciation, display
it, and show a list of depreciated assets.  All in all, TaxWise seems to be
getting wiser every year.

Xpress train to your taxes

Xpress Software is improving practice management and database functions in
Xpress Business Returns, its 1065, 1120, and 1120S software.  The company is
also expanding the messages and diagnostics it provides for the preparation
process.  And Xpress is developing an interface for importing data from other
programs, along with adding state business returns for Alabama and Louisiana.

Vendors like Xpress are making improvements where they can to their business
tax products.  And with the world of 1040 tax prep increasingly moving into
the hands of sophisticated, PC-equipped taxpayers, it's a good idea to beef up
your practice with the latest business tax software, so you can provide
whatever services your business clients require.

Editor's Note:  Another Nail in the Coffin?


I've just come out of a meeting with Intuit, and I'm both impressed and
disturbed.  You know Intuit.  It's the company that bought TurboTax a few
years back.  TurboTax already pretty much owned the consumer tax prep market,
and a great deal of the professional market as well, when Intuit bought
ChipSoft.  With savvy marketing and constant improvements, the vendor has been
able to keep its position in an increasingly turbulent and voracious market.
Having captured the high ground, Intuit is about to fire the opening salvo in
a new war.  And if you don't react the right way, and quickly enough, you
could be one of the ones who gets winged.

Taking it to the streets

What I found both exciting and disturbing is Intuit's announcement of consumer
versions of its business tax products.  Of course, "consumer" is probably a
bit of a misnomer.  Perhaps the term "retail" is more accurate, though these
products do differ a bit in capability from the ProSeries entity products.

But make no mistake about it.  If you currently prepare 1065, 1120, or 1120S
returns for the non-Fortune 1000 set, these products will let your current
clients do a pretty good job in many cases of preparing their own returns.  As
with the current crop of retail, consumer-oriented 1040 products, just how
good a job depends on the complexity of the business transactions and
organization, and how savvy the person trying to produce the return is.  At
the very least, if this series of products is even half as successful as
Intuit's consumer version of TurboTax 1040, it has the potential to do a lot
of damage to the revenue stream in many accounting and tax prep practices.

The end of the world as we know it?

This move into your client base isn't totally unexpected.  After all, did you
really think that the PC had empowered just you?  You haven't been blind to
the advantages offered by computerizing, and neither will some of your
clients.  And the more work they do, the less will be left for you.

But this is old news.  The accounting profession has undergone some dramatic
changes in the last decade.  And it will continue to change in the years to
come.  That's part of life.  And, to be realistic, most professions undergo
similar, if sometimes less dramatic, changes.  Just look at the practice of
medicine.  With the advent of managed health care plans more of the burden of
the health care process is placed on the consumer.  FDA approval of formerly
prescription medications for over-the-counter sales has accelerated this
process.  Think of these products as the Quickens and TurboTaxes of the
medical profession.

New challenges = new opportunities

But the availability of more options for self-care hasn't put doctors out of
business.  After all, you've always had the option of forgoing the physician
and trying to go it alone.  Sometimes you can.  Unless you're in frail shape,
there's not much a doctor can do for you if you're suffering from a cold or
flu.  You can pretty much take care of yourself.  It's when that cold or flu
turns into something more dangerous that the doctor's involvement becomes not
only desirable, but frequently critical.  You might be as good as any doctor
when it comes to a cold, but pneumonia is another story.  That requires
medications that aren't available to you without a doctor's say-so.  And
there's good reason for that.  Administration of these medications requires
that someone have the training and experience to recognize when they are
appropriate, and the judgment to know which medication, and how much of it, to
use.

And training, experience, and judgment are really what are important in our
profession as well.  Yes, you are going to lose business clients to computer
programs that let them prepare their own returns.  Get used to that, because
even if it doesn't happen this year, it is going to happen.

But that doesn't mean you have to give up your tax practice, only that you
have to change with the times.  Because no matter how easy Intuit and other
vendors make the tax preparation process, there are always going to be
questions that require a judgment call.  And judgment isn't something that can
be easily packaged in a computer program, artificial intelligence research
notwithstanding.  It comes from experience, and the long application of this
experience to real-world situations and decisions.

I think that the real money isn't going to be made by the vendors of tax prep
software.  It's going to be made by readers like you who have the savvy, guts,
and vision to be able to adapt.  To stop thinking of themselves as tax
preparers, and start thinking of themselves as tax consultants.  And who take
the initiative in marketing themselves as a solution and source of experienced
advice for those consumers of both the personal and business tax prep products
who are willing to do the grunt work, but smart enough to understand that they
will occasionally need to turn to someone with the training and background to
help them face those judgment calls.

New challenges have a way of also creating new opportunities.  I think the
practice of our profession is going to be very different in coming years.  And
I also think that Accounting is going to be not only a lot more interesting,
but for people with the right attitude, a lot more profitable as well.

Andersen BC Looks At Systems Union's SunSystems Accounting Software


If you or your clients need an accounting software program with powerful
multicurrency and foreign-language capabilities, consider SunSystems, a
product of Great Britain-based Systems Union, Ltd., (10 Bank St., White
Plains, NY 10606, (914) 948-7770).  This innovative program offers tools to
meet the accounting and information requirements of businesses in many
countries.  It's available in 20 languages, including French, German, Spanish,
Russian, Japanese, Chinese, and Arabic.

Systems Union, Ltd.  was founded in 1981 by a small team of financial and
technical experts.  Its SunSystems product was first released in 1982 and has
been regularly upgraded over the years.  Today, Systems Union employs over 300
people in 15 locations, with offices in North America, Europe, and Pacific
Asia.  Systems Union also maintains an international network of
representatives.

Flexible features

SunSystems consists of seven accounting and business modules, as well as
several utility software packages.  Accounting and business modules include
Ledger Accounting (Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, General Ledger),
Fixed Assets, Corporate Allocations, Sales Order Processing, Purchase Order
Processing, Inventory Control, SunQuery report writer, and the SZ screen
modifier utility.

It's easy to install SunSystems on a PC or network.  Loading the diskettes
takes from 15 to 30 minutes.  The program requires at least a 25-MHz 386 or
486 PC with 8MB RAM for the Windows version, or 540K for the DOS version.  For
this review, we tested the Windows version of SunSystems running on a Novell
LAN.  Although this review focuses on the Windows product, the DOS version
offers similar functionality.

Systems Union's software uses a single set of source code, facilitating
customization, a clean user interface, and high functionality.  SunSystems
also enables you to customize information to meet your unique specifications.
For instance, each SunSystems module can be configured to select and report on
various vendor, customer, asset, and inventory information by using analysis
codes.  You can customize these codes to track and report transactions by
customer region, customer sales territory, vendor group, item product type,
and asset location.  And you can customize the chart of accounts by using
account analysis codes.  They provide a 60-character code block, with up to 10
alphanumeric characters for the account code, plus 50 additional characters.

The SZ utility, a screen modifier, lets you customize input screen labels.
(However, data screens cannot be reconfigured to call additional prompts, nor
can you develop new forms using existing ones.)  In addition, you may need to
modify multiple screens when you want to make changes to an input screen,
since other screens use data from input screens.  Although SZ is flexible when
changing text descriptions, field lengths, and removing unnecessary fields,
you need to document all changes, since upgrades override all of SZ's changes.

By and large, however, each module promotes user flexibility.  For example,
the Ledger Accounting module, which consists of Accounts Receivable, Accounts
Payable, and General Ledger, lets you configure journal types in which journal
entries are preset and posted according to classifications such as cash
receipts, prepayments, sales invoices, and foreign currency journals.

You can also configure the Sales and Purchasing modules with various types of
predefined sales and purchasing transactions.  You'll be able to enter preset
information for orders according to the type of order (for example, sales and
purchase order types for specific customers, vendors, countries, or items).

But while the Purchasing module has been designed for flexibility, none of its
standard reports lets you sort information by purchase order type, and only a
couple allow for sorting by analysis code (analysis codes permit you to
organize information in all the modules).  The Purchasing module also lacks a
report writer for customizing or designing reports, or for reporting on
purchase order information by analysis code or purchase order type.  One way
to solve this problem is to use the SunQuery report writer to customize
reports.  When Systems Union releases the purchase order layout report writer,
as well as a Report Definition utility for the Purchasing module, this step
won't be necessary.

Besides the problems with the Purchasing module's reports, we also had
difficulty copying multiple purchase and sales orders in the Purchasing and
Sales modules.  Although the copy command (<F3>) successfully duplicated the
previous Header information screen, field by field, the <F3> key could not be
used for the detail screen.  This is because it only copies the detail line
above the current detail line of the purchase order, as opposed to the last
detail line in the previous purchase order.  This problem was solved by
implementing a macro procedure to record the information for the first PO,
which allowed us to copy the same information into new purchase and sales
orders.

The gang of four

SunQuery, the user-defined transaction-level report writer, offers flexible
data selection, report layout, and sorting features.  Although SunQuery is
fairly flexible and includes more GUI enhancements in its latest version, the
fully graphical report writer that's currently under development will be an
especially welcome upgrade for Windows users.

The Ledger Accounting module includes three other report writers:  Financial
Analysis, Financial Statements, and Financial Tables.  The Financial Analysis
Report Writer provides the easiest way to report on expenditures, in summary
or detail, with flexible sorting options.  The Financial Statements Report
Writer offers enhanced reporting facilities that produce customized income
statements, balance sheets, and other financials.  The Financial Tables Report
Writer can produce reports in a matrix format that you can consolidate from
multiple ledgers to do comparisons of companies or individual departments.
Each report writer is easy to customize.

The latest release of SunSystems also includes a powerful new enhancement, the
Data Dictionary.  The dictionary stores all the information related to
SunSystems data files, including field name, length, start position,
justification, and so forth, in a single location.  This feature enhances the
Ledger Accounting module by including a Report Definition tool that lets you
customize the layout and content of standard SunSystems reports.  It also
allows you to create an unlimited number of custom layouts, because the Report
Definition tool can now read the Data Dictionary directly.

Systems Union is currently developing the Report Definition for all other
SunBusiness modules as well, including Purchasing.  The Data Dictionary should
make it easier for outside vendors to develop and maintain links and
interfaces with SunSystems.  That will facilitate implementation of features
such as Form Entry and Document Imaging, enhancing SunSystems' leadership
position in the marketplace.

We were unable to alter SunSystems' reports with third-party tools because it
didn't generate reports in ASCII format.  Although the reports could be
designed to be generated in other third-party tool formats (such as Lotus),
the generated reports only included summary raw data and therefore did not
include column headings or subtotals.  However, we plan to use the newly
released Data Dictionary as the link between a third-party report writer to
generate and alter the look of the reports (font types and sizes).

The wide, wide world of accounting

The program's international accounting flexibility is one of its strongest
selling points.  It's an excellent solution for international businesses whose
books need to conform to the accounting conventions of a particular country.
Users can access a common database in their choice of the following languages:
English, French, German, or Spanish.

Strong multicurrency support is another program hallmark.  You can work with,
consolidate, and report in an unlimited number of currencies, as well as
maintain inventory and create multicurrency orders and invoices.  The program
also performs currency conversion during data entry, and converts foreign
currency to base currency or vice versa.

A sophisticated mapping facility offered in the program allows you to map out
a chart of accounts from one database to another to satisfy country-mandated
chart of accounts and company-wide reporting standards.

SunSystems offers predefined charts of accounts to accommodate varying
statutory requirements for more than 50 countries.  The program complies with
domestic and international financial standards, such as GAAP (Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles), FASB (US standards), CICA (Canadian
standards), SSAP (Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales),
and IAS (International Accounting Standards).

New features have been added to address some of the European tax reporting
requirements for the Value Added Tax (VAT).  Although SunSystems allows you to
customize VAT reports and procedures for maintaining VAT information, the new
version includes an updated Tax Listing Report and a Day Book Listing that
generates sequential references against transactions.

Strong security and more

SunSystems Accounting Software sports strong data security features.  You can
restrict any user's or company's field access to menu options, analysis codes,
or account types.  And you can set up user groups for easier maintenance and
tighter reins on security.

SunSystems includes drill-down capability within its Ledger Accounting module,
letting you trace a journal entry back to its source.  It's designed to post
only balanced journal entries and offers the option to "put the journal
on-hold" if corrections or supervisory approvals need to be made, making the
product a real-time solution.  SunSystems also lets you post entries in
separate accounting periods, as long as the periods are "open" and you can
access them.

A powerful, flexible budget ledger feature lets you maintain up to 10 budget
ledgers at either the account or project level.  This provides a great deal of
flexibility for financial reports and analysis.

The combined ledger is designed to present information in real time.  All
reports and inquiries paint an immediate snapshot of a company's actual
position rather than its position the last time you ran a report.

An intermediate ledger, or rough book, allows all users to post complete
transactions in a working ledger.  This feature, originally designed to meet
Italian statutory requirements, helps reduce numerous adjusting entries.

Issues and challenges

SunSystems is a very flexible accounting system and can provide powerful
functionality if you set up the system properly.  But you'll need to invest a
great deal of time and effort into designing the system before implementing
it, since an incorrect installation can lead to major modifications later, and
you may overlook key features if you implement the setup phase too hastily.

The average cost of a single-user SunSystems license (for both Windows and DOS
versions) ranges from $2,000 to $5,000 per module, and for a four-user license
from $2,500 to $10,000 per module.  Complete product support is available
through comprehensive manuals, a telephone hot-line, on-line system help,
messages, and user defined help areas, where specific on-line assistance is
provided.  You can also direct questions regarding any SunSystems module to
the technical support staff by paying an additional support fee, which
includes free upgrades upon request and use of technical bulletins.  A full
range of client-server products is also available, including support for SQL
Server and Oracle.

The Sun will come out tomorrow

What does the future hold for SunSystems?  Over the years Systems Union has
become a leader in international accounting and business applications by
offering a wide range of solutions for small to large companies.  Systems
Union allies with many major hardware and software vendors, keeps abreast of
new technology, and focuses research and development efforts on improving its
product.

The company plans to continue enhancing the graphical user interface (GUI) for
each operating environment it supports.  In addition, the current Microsoft
SQL Server version of SunSystems will be ported to Sybase SQL Server 10.  This
will allow support for SQL technology on a number of Unix platforms, including
the RS/6000, Sun SPARC, and HP 9000 machines, as well as SCO Unix systems.

Although SunSystems is currently available in 20 languages, Systems Union
intends to add new translations over the next three years.  In addition,
Systems Union plans to work with foreign-language authors to improve
documentation and modules.

Information Services:  In Search of On-line CPAs


With various commercial on-line services (such as CompuServe, America Online,
and Prodigy) and the Internet in the news so much these days, you're probably
wondering if it's worth your time to check out their diverse offerings.

For the average accountant, the answer is a qualified yes.  There are specific
resources for accountants on CompuServe and the Internet, as well as features
on America Online and Prodigy that might appeal to the average accountant.  In
this article, we'll review the major on-line services, as well as examine
accounting-related services on the Internet.

On the one hand, the major on-line services feature a limited number of
accounting-related subject areas.  Only CompuServe devotes entire areas to
discussions of accounting information.  On the Internet, there is a Usenet
newsgroup devoted to financial software.

So what's an accountant to do?

The commercial on-line world is mainly a good place for accountants to find
additional information about computing.  Most computer magazines sponsor
on-line forums of some sort, ranging from ZD Net on CompuServe (which includes
information from PC Magazine, PC Week, and more) to the varied offerings on
America Online's Newsstand service (representing PC World, Windows, and
WordPerfect magazines).  And all three commercial services feature a wealth of
mainstream financial information, ranging from extensive market reporting on
the Prodigy CNBC area to a wide variety of investment information on the
America Online Personal Finance Forum (including Morningstar Mutual Funds
listings, a Tax Forum, and various magazines).

Try before you buy

In addition, America Online and CompuServe feature large libraries of
shareware-software that you can try out and pay for later if you like it.
While a good chunk of shareware tends to be amateurish, many useful programs
are available, particularly small tools that perform specific functions.

A search through the America Online software libraries, using the keyword
"accounting," yields over 800 matches.  Granted, this number includes many
home-oriented shareware packages for tasks like balancing checkbooks and
calculating mortgage payments, but some of the software may be of interest to
the accounting professional.

And, of course, there's one additional reason to go with any on-line service:
universal electronic mail.  If you join a commercial on-line service or
procure an Internet account, you can exchange electronic mail with any other
Internet or commercial service user.  (This doesn't extend to files, by the
way; a file attached to an America Online mail message can be received only by
an America Online user.)  With over 28 million e-mail users in America, you
can be sure you'll have a few clients who will appreciate the instant
communications offered via e-mail.

Who else is out there?

Other specialized on-line services are available that you may find useful,
depending on your needs.  Dow Jones runs an on-line business-news service that
you can access via MCI Mail (800/444-6245) or Knight Ridder (formerly Dialog)
Information Services (800/334-2564).  The DowVision service is also accessible
from Coopers & Lybrand's Tax News Network (800/528-5816), which provides
extensive tax information of its own, in addition to the Dow Jones material
and articles from other tax research providers.  Both the LEXIS/NEXIS on-line
service (800/227-4908) and Knight Ridder feature Dun's Financial Records Plus
and Standard & Poor's Corporate Descriptions.  You can also find useful
accounting information on Creative Solutions' bulletin board system ARNE
(800/968-8900).

Before you get started

To access on-line services or the Internet, you'll need a modem-the faster,
the better.  A high-speed modem is a good investment.  These days you can find
decent high-speed modems running at 28.8K bits per second for $200 or so.
America Online, CompuServe, and many Internet service providers offer 28.8Kbps
access, while Prodigy and CompuServe top out at 14.4Kbps.

America Online and Prodigy require you to use their free software to access
their services; you can find Prodigy starter kits in most computer stores,
while America Online distributes its access software with many magazines, as
well as through direct mail solicitations and bundling deals with computer
makers.  You can access CompuServe with any communications software package
(such as Procomm Plus), but a graphical front-end, WinCIM, is also available.
Getting on the Internet typically means using specialized software, especially
if you want to access the World Wide Web (see "The Net Surfer" in the December
'95 issue of Accounting Technology for more details).

America Online

America Online combines a lot of consumer-oriented information with a slew of
on-line magazines, such as Your Money and Worth.  Most of this information is
probably of little interest to the average accountant.  Yes, there are some
areas you might find useful in an eclectic practice, such as the Morningstar
guide to mutual funds, but by and large these services are for generalists,
not accountants.

The newest version of AOL software for Windows (there is a Mac version as
well) will feature full Internet access, however, including a top-notch Web
browser from InternetWorks.  It should be fully released by the time you read
this article.  And America Online is the cheapest commercial on-line service,
making its Internet access even more financially attractive.

CompuServe

The only major on-line service to feature forums specifically for accountants
is CompuServe.  The Accounting Vendor Forum offers areas run by various
accounting software vendors (including Best!Ware, BNA, Champion Business
Systems, Manzanita Software, NEBS, Open Systems, Outlook Software, SBT
Accounting, SCALA, Solomon Software, Versatile Solutions, XP Systems, ZPAY
Payroll, and others), as well as a number of general discussion groups (The
Break Room, Ask the CPAs, Accounting Training, Tax Issues, and Accounting
Software).

While discussions in the vendor forums probably won't interest you if you're
not using the vendor's software, the general discussion areas are lively and
filled with postings.  I found one message describing a hypothetical business
transaction, in which the author asked other members of the forum what the
appropriate journal entries and taxable income and deductions would be, and
whether the transaction qualified as a royalty, commission, or sale of
intangible property rights.  This question yielded several responses from
other accountants participating in the forum.  In addition to advice and
discussion, software libraries specifically for accountants are available on
the forum.

The recently opened Accountants Forum on CompuServe is sponsored by the AICPA.
It includes message areas devoted to general information and ethics;
accounting; audit, compilation, and review; taxes; information technology;
personal financial planning; management accounting and industry; government;
CPA firms; universities and colleges; and management consulting.  Also within
the forums, you will find separate libraries devoted to many of these same
subjects.

CompuServe also allows access to the Internet (including File Transfer
Protocol and Telnet features, Usenet newsgroups, as well as the World Wide Web
if you use CompuServe's NetLauncher software).  For any accountant, it's clear
that CompuServe is the place to begin the on-line quest, if only because of
the existence of an Accounting Vendors Forum and the AICPA's new Accountants
Forum.

CompuServe's pricing plan allows access to over 3,000 Internet addresses,
including e-mail.  They also offer software for DOS and Macintosh users.

Prodigy

As the most consumer-oriented major on-line service, Prodigy doesn't provide
much information of direct interest to accountants.  But that doesn't mean
Prodigy is a total wash, only that its information tends to be general in
nature.

Prodigy does have the most extensive financial information on-line, however.
It's the official on-line service of CNBC, the cable service that devotes
daily programming to business topics.  Yes, you'll find the stock listings
offered by all the major on-line services.  You can also buy and sell stock on
Prodigy and set up "track lists" to keep tabs on specific stocks in your
portfolio.  And Prodigy's CNBC area goes further by offering complete market
information, including Dow Jones averages, gold prices, Treasury bond yields,
and a U.S.  dollar index.  It also gives you an overview of futures and
mutual-fund information, with listings of over 6,000 funds.  And for financial
experts, Kiplinger's magazine is on-line.

In addition, Prodigy offers full Internet access, including newsgroups, file
transfer capability, and a World Wide Web browser.  While the Internet is a
vast, amorphous entity, you'll find some useful resources there for an
accounting practice, and one way to reach those resources is through Prodigy.

Prodigy's pricing plans are more varied, offering plans starting at $9.95 per
month, with its top plan costing $24.95 per month.  Each plan includes a
number of free access hours, with minimal charges for additional hours and
minutes.  Prodigy also offers on-line software compatible with DOS and
Macintosh machines, providing access for almost all computer environments.

The Internet

Despite the ad-hoc nature of the Internet, a surprising number of resources
are available on the Net that your firm could find valuable.  The main trick
is finding their locations.  I've done a few searches and come up with several
accounting resources on the World Wide Web that can also serve as a
springboard to other Internet accounting treasures.

With a Web browser, good places to start are the Accountants Home Page
(http://www.servtech.com/re/acct.html) and the Accounting Resources on the
Internet Home Page
(http://www.rutgers.edu/Accounting/raw/internet/internet.htm).  Both sites
offer listings for other accounting resources on the Web.  Some of these
listings are general in nature (most of you won't need to know about the NY
State Assembly or care about accessing the THOMAS Web service run by the
Federal Government).

Some sites, however, are operated by prominent accounting organizations.  For
instance, the Education Materials Committee of the American Accounting
Association runs its own home page
(http://www.rutgers.edu/Accounting/raw/aaa/aaa.htm), which also contains
pointers to other accounting-related resources on the Internet.  In addition,
there's a low-traffic Usenet newsgroup called
comp.os.ms-windows.apps.financial where you can discuss various Windows-based
financial applications.

Load up your software and log on

The on-line world is rapidly becoming a valuable business tool in American
society.  While some services, such as America Online and Prodigy, still need
to beef up their accounting-specific resources, there's a wealth of
information already available on CompuServe, the Internet, and several
specialized services.

The on-line world has a way of creeping up on you, and it won't be long before
information services begin creating more content of interest to accountants.
The brand new Microsoft Network, in fact, is already developing such
resources, and you'll find Accounting Technology, as well as other Faulkner &
Gray accounting publications, and areas such as the Accounting Office and the
CCH Business Owner's Toolkit, on-line there right now.

Practice Development:  Form 5500 Follow-up


In the August 1995 issue we looked at eight pension return preparation
packages.  These ranged from simple forms-oriented programs to comprehensive
employee benefits administration systems.  As a follow-up, this time around we
looked at two additional entries in this growing field:  ATX Tax Solver 5500
Benefit Plan and Shepard's Form 5500 System.

ATX solves your 5500 needs

Offered by ATX Forms Inc., ATX Tax Solver 5500 Benefit Plan differs from the
other pension software packages we've looked at in that it's spreadsheet
based.  The vendor's family of software includes modules to prepare forms in
all the major income tax-filing areas, including individual, business,
fiduciary, and payroll taxes.  In addition to tax preparation products, ATX
also offers a depreciation system and a tax planner.

All of ATX Forms' applications are available in either 1-2-3 or Excel
versions.  ATX supplied the software to us on a single 3.5-inch diskette, and
we quickly installed it by simply typing ATX at the command line prompt.  We
used the Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows edition for this review, but the software
supports both the DOS and Windows versions of 1-2-3.  You can also get any of
the ATX products for the Macintosh (which work with the Mac version of Excel).
And, if you'd rather not have to play with a spreadsheet at all, ATX just
introduced its Saber line of software, which doesn't require you to have a
spreadsheet program installed.

The 47-page user guide covers operating instructions for all of the ATX
modules, and provides information for specific modules as needed.  The
documentation, though not voluminous, adequately covers getting started;
entering, saving, and printing tax information; menus and macros; tips and
techniques; and troubleshooting.  Instructions in the manual and on-screen are
good enough that someone not familiar with spreadsheets will be able to
produce returns.  If you already feel comfortable using a spreadsheet, you'll
be right at home with the product.

Once you're in the spreadsheet program, select the main file, !OPENATX, to
reveal starting instructions and a list of supported forms.  Forms included in
the package are the 5500, 5500-C/R, 5500-EZ, supporting schedules A, B, C, E,
F, G, P, SSA, and forms 2848, 4506, 4571, 5558, 8453E, 8821, 8822, 945, SS4,
and W9.  To process a client, check off the forms you wish to prepare, then
press Ctrl-N.  This automatically creates a taxpayer directory, copies the
forms into the directory, and opens Page 1.  The program makes good use of
spreadsheet macro facilities, including over a dozen macros that automate such
tasks as opening, updating, saving, and printing files.  You can also select
these tasks from a pull-down menu.

How many forms am I holding up?

One useful feature is that you can have more than just a single form open at
the same time.  Just how many can be open simultaneously depends on the amount
of memory available.  Given enough memory, you could conceivably have them all
open.  Once you open a form, you can key your data into an on-screen
reproduction of the original form.  The screen is color-coded, displaying the
form in black, the data in blue, and the instructions in purple.  You have a
choice of using Input Mode (by pressing the Ctrl-I key combination), or you
can move around freely as in any spreadsheet.  If you choose Input Mode, the
right arrow key takes you to the next input cell.  All cells not requiring
input are protected, and the program carries over standard information, such
as name, address, and identification numbers, to other forms as appropriate.

ATX Tax Solver 5500 automatically performs math calculations on the financial
input areas and produces balanced statements.  However, it's still possible to
have an out-of-balance condition, since the program automatically carries the
net asset amount from the balance sheet to the income statement.

When you complete one page or form, you call up the next, until you've
finished them all.  You can easily print to an HP-compatible laser printer by
using the macros provided, and ATX also supports dot-matrix and inkjet
printers.  You have the option of selecting and printing one or all forms, and
using a batch-printing mode.  The printed forms are clear, professional
looking, and IRS approved.  No diagnostics are available to alert you to
problems or erroneous input, but you can produce a two-year comparison of the
income and expense entries to provide some troubleshooting help.

To transfer client information to the next year, a macro (Ctrl-U) updates the
new forms with carryover information.  ATX Tax Solver 5500 doesn't produce an
invoice or client transmittal letter, however, and Forms 990-T and 5330 Return
of Excise Taxes Related to Employee Benefit Plans are not available in this
module.

No help for the weary?

On-line help is pretty much taken for granted these days, and this is one
place in which ATX Tax Solver 5500 is a bit weak.  If you've grown used to tax
prep software that gives you explanations and advice on a line-item basis, you
may be a bit disappointed.  ATX assumes that you know what you're doing when
it comes to Form 5500 preparation.  While the standard spreadsheet help
screens are available, neither the screen nor manual provides help on the
technical aspects of 5500 preparation.  You also need to step through
inapplicable input boxes; since the program doesn't automatically skip them,
you need to know which items require responses.

ATX Tax Solver 5500 isn't the fanciest product to produce 5500s.  But for a
reasonable price, it supplies an efficient way to get the job done, although
it does require you to be conversant with the Form 5500 preparation process.

Should you need help, technical support is available on weekdays from 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m., EST.  The back of the manual also offers some troubleshooting
advice.

Does Shepard's lead the flock?

Shepard's/McGraw-Hill is a well-known, venerable publisher of books and
services.  Less well-known is its expanding line of software.  One of the
newest is the Shepard's Form 5500 System reviewed here.  Other Shepard's
software products include a tax forms library in addition to an integrated
family of estate planning, preparation, and accounting programs.

The software is Windows based, and you install it through the Program Manager
by using the File Run command.  The install routine establishes a new program
group, with separate icons for the 5500 and 5500-C/R.

The User's Manual is a brief 11 pages, but it covers basic program operations
efficiently.  It uses screen shots to good advantage to illustrate the primary
steps.  Making up for the sparse documentation is extensive on-line help to
assist you in working with the program, along with on-line IRS instructions
for the forms and line-by-line instructions.  Particularly useful is the split
screen option; while you input various lines on the form in the upper window,
the instructions for those lines automatically appear in the lower window.

Most practitioners don't produce Form 5500 all that frequently, so a nice
feature in the help function is the indexes for two Shepard's publications,
ERISA Practice and Procedure and Guide to Pension and Profit Sharing Plans.
Shepard's offers these books at a discount to purchasers of its 5500 software.

Clicking on the program icon brings up the opening screen, consisting of Page
1 of the 5500 form.  The familiar Windows menu and tool bars cross the top of
the screen.  In addition to standard icons on the tool bar, you'll find icons
for the six pages of the 5500 form.  You can use these icons to open one or
more of the pages at the same time.  Supporting forms are accessible from the
Form pull-down menu, including Schedules A, B, C, E, F, G, P, Form 5558, and
SSA.

To start a new return, just begin inputting information into the on-screen
Page 1.  Otherwise, open an existing file using the File menu or icon.  Input
is straightforward and easy since you're working with an accurate reproduction
of the actual form.  When you enter an item, the cursor automatically moves to
the next input field, and you can use the Tab key or mouse to skip a field.
The software doesn't automatically skip inapplicable entry fields, so you need
to be aware of which entries are appropriate, based on what you've entered
previously for a client.

Shepard's Form 5500 System carries over names, dates, and identification
numbers to other forms.  It automatically totals amounts in the financial and
numerical fields, and carries over the total of net assets on the balance
sheet to the income statement to show the change in net assets.  Everything
balances fine, but be careful if you change amounts later, or the income
statement may no longer foot.

With your input complete, you're ready to print.  As with the ATX package
reviewed above, the Shepard's software provides no diagnostics to alert you to
potential errors or inconsistencies.  Printing to an HP-compatible laser
printer produces crisp, clear IRS forms, however, and Shepard's includes
downloadable soft fonts.  You can print one, several, or all forms at once.
This 5500 system doesn't contain client transmittal letters, invoices, or
Forms 5500-EZ, 5330, or 990-T, though you can obtain the forms by purchasing
Shepard's separate forms library package.

Technical support is available at a toll-free number on weekdays from 7:00
a.m.  to 5:00 p.m.  Mountain time.

Shepard's Form 5500 System is easy to learn and use, letting you produce
high-quality 5500 forms in a short time.  Although it lacks some bells and
whistles of more comprehensive (and expensive) packages, it does the basic
task of creating a Form 5500 very well.

Newspages:  Tax Vendors for Sale


An offer you can't refuse Dept.  What would you do with a couple of billion
dollars?  Illinois-based tax research publisher and tax prep software
developer CCH, Inc.  announced in late November that it had been sold to
Wolters Kluwer NV, an Amsterdam-based international publisher, for a cool $1.9
billion.  CCH's product line includes ProSystem fx, CCH Access, and CCH Tax
Assistant.

According to CCH public relations manager Mary Dale Walters, the Dutch company
wanted to acquire CCH's technology knowledge for use in the European market,
as well as to increase its presence in the US market through technologies like
the CCH Business Owners Toolkit on the Microsoft Network.  She doesn't foresee
many immediate changes in CCH's own product line, however.

"There's a chance of new and better technology down the road," she says.  The
cash infusion "will give us more impetus for continued development.  We're
already aggressively pursuing on-line activities.  We can do more."

Founded over 103 years ago, CCH was named Commerce Clearing House until last
year.  Although it's a publicly traded business, the majority of stock has
been in the hands of the Thorne family up until now, and Oakleigh Thorne,
president and CEO, will continue to manage the company.

One hurdle that CCH and other vendors were working on overcoming at press time
was Congress's and the President's budget wrangling last autumn.  "Obviously
we can't do anything until they do something," says Walters.  "At this point,
we're not sure when we'll have that legislation.  There are a number of
retroactive provisions in that bill."  Although CCH began shipping a
preliminary version of its tax software as early as November, the delays in
the final forms may mean that many taxpayers will have to file amended
returns.  For extra info, you can call CCH at (800) 45-PROFX.

More tax mergers Dept.  The CCH deal was preceded last autumn by another tax
vendor acquisition.  This one involved RAM Software, makers of RAM 1040
Professional Tax Software, which was picked up by SCS/Compute, makers of Tax
Machine and LMS Tax.  Unlike SCS's purchase of Accountant's Microsystems
Inc.'s Tax Machine line several years ago, SCS won't continue development on
the RAM program.

"They're taking features in RAM and adding it to their own," says RAM vice
president Frances Michelon.  "They wanted to expand their market share."
RAM's head programmer Richard Michelon will be writing a program to convert
RAM 1040 Professional Tax Software data to Tax Machine and LMS Tax formats.

SCS is setting up special support lines to help RAM customers make it through
the transition, according to LMS Tax product manager Lou Ann Vandemore.
"We're contacting each of their customers and offering them LMS Tax and Tax
Machine," she says.  Future RAM-inspired enhancements to SCS's tax products
may include its multistate processing, speed, and the way it accounted for
automobiles.  Call SCS/Compute at (800) 736-4587 for more information.

New on CD-ROM dept.  The second issue of Faulkner & Gray's The Electronic
Accountant began shipping last November.  Featuring advanced multimedia
functionality, the new issue is the first out from the product's new
Editor-in-Chief (and Accounting Technology Consulting Editor) Laurence K.
Zuckerman, CPA, MST.

The cover story, "Discomania:  The Best CD-ROMs for Accountants," includes
demonstrations of popular tax research, forms, spreadsheet, and CPE software
products.  Also on the disc are war stories about malpractice insurance,
pension compliance tax planning, 1040 software, installing a tape backup
drive, and the manufacturing practice niche.  For a free copy of the
Electronic Accountant, call (800) 535-8403.

Down with Unix Dept.  Platinum Software announced the general release of
Platinum SQL NT 3.2 last November, a client/server accounting solution that
takes advantage of Microsoft's BackOffice suite, primarily its Windows NT and
Microsoft SQL Server components.  New modules in Platinum SQL NT include Asset
Management and Advanced General Ledger Allocations.

A new financial alerts feature will send an administrator an e-mail alert if a
specified threshold is exceeded, such as a cash balance going above or below a
certain level.  Queue cards will help train users through processes like
entering vouchers.

The new release signals a switch in strategy for Platinum, which used to
support the Unix market by running on top of Sybase's version of SQL Server.
No longer.  Platinum is now betting on Windows NT over Unix.

"We have to make a choice," says Kevin Dowling, Platinum's vice president of
marketing.  "We see more and more of our customer base have been interested in
an NT and SQL Server solution.  We think Windows NT will be the dominant
client/server operating system.  We decided to focus our energies on providing
a solution that's integrated and almost plug-and-play with BackOffice,
reducing the risks of having all the pieces fit together."

To help its Unix customers make the transition, Platinum is becoming partners
with Microsoft and Compaq to provide the necessary software and hardware.
"We'll release product upgrades for a year and do product support for the year
after that," comments Dowling.  "They can continue to use the product and will
have access to the source code at the end of 1996."  Dowling also says that
another vendor may eventually take over Platinum's Sybase offering.  Platinum
SQL NT sells for $10,000 to $15,000 per module, plus per-user fees.

Several modules for the network-based Platinum for Windows product are also
finally in release, including two general ledger modules (standard and
premiere), along with a cash management module.  By the time you read this,
accounts payable and accounts receivable should be available, and in March,
Platinum plans to release order entry, purchase order, and inventory modules.
For more information on these products, call Platinum at (714) 453-4000.

Going vertical Dept.  Intuit's latest editions of QuickBooks move the
market-leading small-business accounting solution onto the path of vertical
accounting software.  QuickBooks 4.0 takes a small-business user through a
step-by-step interview that customizes their books according to the industry
they're in and generates customized documentation for over 20 different
industries.  The software also offers customized fields, as well as different
methods of handling income.  Other new features include contact management,
to-do lists, mail merge, and the ability to print 1099, 940, and 941 forms.

This new QuickBooks line will be available in several iterations, in both
Windows ($99) and Macintosh ($119) versions on disk, and in a Windows version
on CD-ROM ($129).  QuickBooks Pro 4.0 for Windows ($189) and QuickBooks Pro
4.0 for Macintosh ($189) will add time tracking, estimating, and advanced job
costing features.

The company has also announced a fix to a bug in version 3.0.  When QuickBooks
3.0 was allowed to condense data, the average cost of inventory items could be
affected, causing inventory values and the cost of goods sold to be under- or
over-valued.  Intuit estimates that only a few users will be affected by this
error.  For more details, call (800) 238-4247.

In other Intuit news, the company is introducing a version of its retail
TurboTax and MacInTax programs designed with special business advice for
customers who need to prepare their own Schedule C.  The product will be
called TurboTax (or MacInTax) for Business/Sole Proprietorship.  For more
details, check out Intuit's new Web site at http://www.intuit.com/TurboTax or
you can just call them at (800) 934-1040.  Fresh fruit Dept.  The latest
version of Peachtree Accounting for Windows, Release 3.5, began shipping in
November.  It offers a multimedia setup feature with video and audio clips
that take small-business users through the process of automating their books.
The $129 program includes 75 business templates.

Other new features provide management tools such as an events log that alerts
you when quotes expire or invoices go uncollected.  Also new are a to-do list,
alert signals for when customers exceed credit limits and inventory items are
down, and additional customized reporting and drill-down capabilities.  To
learn more, phone (800) 247-3224, or connect to the Peachtree Web site at

Quicklooks:  MAXShare and Hijaak Graphics Suite


Problem:  you have a phone, fax machine, and modem, but you only have one
phone line.  Or you have several phones, modems, fax machines, and other
telecommunication devices, and more than one phone line, but still not enough
lines to go around.  Expensive solution:  add more phone lines and pay an
extra $250 or so per line every year to the phone company.  Another expensive
solution:  set up a network, including a complicated network modem
configuration.  Better solution:  make a one-time investment of about $349 in
MAXShare, a new state-of-the-art line-sharing device.

At approximately 6.5 by 9.5 by 1 inch, MAXShare doesn't take up a lot of desk
space.  However, it does allow you to share multiple telecom devices
automatically.  In fact, MAXShare permits up to eight devices to share up to
four lines.

MAXShare is easy-to-use hardware that works with your existing phone lines.
It uses an included 9-volt power transformer that plugs into any standard AC
electric outlet.  After you plug the transformer into the back of MAXShare and
your electrical outlet, simply connect MAXShare to a standard RJ-11 phone jack
and then connect your phone, fax, modem, or any other telecom device to one of
MAXShare's eight RJ-11 jack connectors.  The entire process takes only
seconds.  There are no switches to set, no software to install, and no network
required.  If you do need technical support, it's available toll free, from
Monday through Friday, from 9 to 5.

Automatic routing

MAXShare's operation is completely transparent.  It automatically routes
incoming calls to the assigned telecom devices.  In other words, MAXShare
sends calls that come in on phone line 1 to telecom device 1, calls that
arrive on phone line 2 to telecom device 2, and so on, up to the unit's
four-line maximum.

There are limitations, of course.  For starters, modems connected to telecom
device jacks 5 through 8 cannot receive incoming calls.  Perhaps more
important, if the telecom device associated with an incoming call is in use,
MAXShare does not route the call, and the caller hears a continuous ringing
signal (there is no charge to long-distance callers when this occurs).  This
may be inconvenient for your callers, and you certainly would not want your
primary client phone lines to behave this way.  However, you can minimize this
problem (for example, by using your modem after business hours).

MAXShare also prevents accidental interruption of phone lines in use and is
designed to eliminate conflicts.  For example, when a modem attempts to dial
out, the modem in essence takes its "handset" off-hook, "listens" for a dial
tone, then dials the number.  Enter MAXShare.  When it detects that your modem
has gone off-hook, it assigns it to any phone line that's available.  At this
point, the modem gets the dial tone that it's waiting for and makes the call.

But what if you try to access a modem when all outgoing MAXShare lines are in
use?  MAXShare will cause your modem to deliver a "No Dial Tone" message to
your communications software, which typically prompts you to try again later
when phone lines are available.  MAXShare will not interrupt the current
session in progress or cause irritating or costly disconnections.

Room to grow

MaxShare offers several advantages.  For starters, competitive line-sharing
devices, which may be less expensive than MAXShare, only work with a single
phone line.  MAXShare accommodates up to four phone lines, which gives you
room to grow.

In fact, if you're considering setting up a network to share phone lines and
telecom devices, you may want to consider MAXShare as a more affordable
alternative.  It makes adding extra phone lines easy and reduces the need for
more network modems.  MAXShare also connects to any modem; you can use it with
virtually all PC, Macintosh, and Unix workstations.

Currently, I have my telephone, fax/answering machine, and modem hooked up to
MAXShare, which is connected to a single outgoing telephone line.  MAXShare
works well for my SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) setup, and this versatile
device may be helpful for you too.

HiJaak Graphics Suite

Boldly go where no accountant has gone before.  Instead of just using a
spreadsheet program in your practice to graph data in financial statements and
other reports into bar and pie charts, and a presentation graphics program to
dazzle clients at meetings, and a desktop publishing program to produce
newsletters and related correspondence, you can use HiJaak Graphics Suite to
relieve the frustration of employing separate tools for heavy-duty graphics
chores.  It matches up programs and graphical data with compatible file
structures, sharpens your output, and lets you capture, modify, and enhance
images.  The $99 Suite provides an integrated set of utilities with
sophisticated graphics capabilities.

Each program in the Windows-based Suite performs different functions.  You can
use them separately for simple tasks, or collectively for multi-function jobs.
Browser, the desktop publishing program, manages files and organizes projects,
offering easy access to the other components.  Smuggler helps you search for
and import files from other applications in over 75 formats.  TouchUp turns
dull, fuzzy images into bright, crisp ones, and offers various enhancement
capabilities.  PRO is a screen capture feature that saves images in many
formats, and Draw lets you customize and modify images with 15 drawing tools.

Killing two birds with one stone

If you're comfortable using Windows, you can get started quickly, but
operating the program fully and efficiently takes some time and patience.  My
first encounter with the program was a few months ago while reviewing pension
software packages (Accounting Technology, August 1995).  HiJaak PRO produced
the screen shots that appeared in the story.  Being short on time and long on
pension packages, I ignored other features and ventured directly into
capturing the screen images.  Surprisingly, I was able to produce
professional-looking illustrations in short order, with a quick stop over in
Retouch and File Conversion.  E-mailing the images to the editors didn't
affect their quality or reduce the resolution size.  I later returned to the
program for a closer look and discovered the extensive nature of the other
programs within the Suite.

Available on eight 3.5-inch diskettes or one CD-ROM, HiJaak loads through the
Windows File Run command.  The CD-ROM version contains 3,000 additional clip
art images as a bonus.  Full installation requires 40MB of hard disk space,
but running the program from the CD requires only 1MB of disk space.

HiJaak furnishes you with a several-hundred-page User Guide that contains
screen pictures and diagrams for each application.  The Getting Started manual
includes an overview and installation instructions, along with a four-lesson
tutorial that shows you how to create a flier combining text and graphics from
various sources.

To organize the components in your project, begin with HiJaak Browser.  Here
you catalog, view, and search for files.  A file index tree similar to the
Windows File Manager appears on the left side of a split screen, allowing you
to collect various files that contain pertinent data for the job at hand.  On
the right, Browser displays "thumbnail" images of the files in the collection.
You can open, copy, print, or move these images.  When you're ready to work on
a thumbnail, you drag it to the appropriate icon to launch the HiJaak program
you need.

For example, you may have a thumbnail of a map you want to use for a project.
Just drag the thumbnail to the HiJaak PRO icon to launch that program.  With
the thumbnail now in PRO, you set the options for how you want the image
captured and where to store it.  PRO takes a "snapshot" and places it in a
file.  If the designated application requires the image to be in a different
format, PRO can convert it at your direction.  PRO can capture pictures in
both Windows and DOS environments.

To place the picture in your text file, first open HiJaak Smuggler.  Smuggler
stays running in the background until you're ready to use it.  In Browser's
file manager, locate the file containing your text; it will appear as a
thumbnail.  Clicking on the thumbnail launches the word processing app in
which the text was written.  Smuggler will have attached itself to the title
bar of the word processor, so you just click on the icon there.  After
indicating where you want the picture, as well as its size and resolution,
Smuggler places it there.

Touch up your images

If the image appears fuzzy or dark, you can filter it with HiJaak TouchUp.
TouchUp works with color, grayscale, or black and white images in a variety of
formats.  It produces an instantaneous display while you change various
factors, so you can experiment and adjust the image as you go.  A variety of
retouch tools are at your disposal, such as color, texture, brightness,
contrast, halftones, airbrush, pen, eraser, sharpening, softening, embossing,
sculpting, highlighting, sizing, positioning, and more.  Even though you may
need to consult the manual to learn each of these tools, you can intuitively
perform many tasks on your own by simply moving various gauges and trying the
tool icons.

With HiJaak Draw, you can create some of your own artwork to convey a
particular message in your project.  Draw contains a vast array of drawing
tools.  Whether you merely want to produce a geometric figure with some text
inside, or compose a new work of art, Draw will accommodate you.  The Draw
manual is over 350 pages long and offers ample features and intricacies to
serve both amateur and professional illustrators.

Draw lets you organize artwork into multiple layers and pages.  Twenty-three
drawing methods extend the versatility of its 15 drawing tools for creating
lines, boxes, circles, and other objects.  For example, it offers seven
methods for drawing a rectangle, such as corner-to-corner and
center-to-corner.

Your freehand drawing can be natural, or you can set tolerance limits that
smooth out irregularities in your lines and shapes.  You can also program your
text in many fonts and shapes, so they can flow straight or curve around
objects at your command.  Additional tools help you position, shape,
transform, and arrange these objects.  They can be painted with a choice of
several color models, each with seemingly endless colors and gradations.

Draw sets up and manages various clipart libraries, letting you easily import
and export images.  Numerous print options accommodate your specifications.
For instance, if the finished product exceeds your paper size, Draw can tile
the picture onto several sheets if you want a large image, or scale it down to
a single sheet.  And if you're sending artwork to a printing press, you can
produce the work in color-separated format.

How suite it is!

When you incorporate the five HiJaak modules into the HiJaak Graphics Suite,
the result is a comprehensive, integrated solution to your graphics needs.

Creative Uses of Life Insurance Abound


"One of the last great tax shelters," said Charles Ratner, a principal in
Ernst & Young's Cleveland office and the firm's national director of personal
insurance counseling, when describing life insurance.  He explained the reason
is that life insurance's cash value builds up tax-free and can be accessed
during the insured's lifetime through tax-free withdrawals and loans and there
is an income tax-free death benefit.

Whole or variable life insurance is usually favored because of the substantial
cash value that can be built up.  Also, second-to-die policies are
increasingly being used when the marital deduction can insulate the first
spouse's estate from estate tax.

Tax-Wise Moves.  If you don't want the policy proceeds to be included in an
insured estate, then you must make sure that the insured was never the policy
owner or the insured must have transferred ownership more then three years
before death.

A common way of making sure that the insured doesn't own the policy is through
the creation of an irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT).  The insured
normally transfers cash annually to the ILIT to pay the premiums.  If
possible, the trust takes out the policy so the above three-year rule doesn't
come into play.  In order for the cash contributions to qualify for the gift
tax annual exclusion, the ILIT normally gives the trust beneficiaries a
Crummey withdrawal power.

In setting up an ILIT, a financial planner must be aware of whether a
generation skipping transfer (GST) tax can apply.  Because life insurance is a
leverage vehicle, the amount that can eventually be subject to the GST tax can
be quite substantial.  Accordingly, there is a strategy that can allocate part
of the GST $1 million exemption to amounts being transferred to the trust.

ILITs are also being used in conjunction with lifetime charitable transfers.
Bill Fleming, director of personal financial planning in the Hartford, Conn.
office of Coopers & Lybrand, noted that wealth transferred to charity is often
replaced by using the savings on income taxes from the charitable transfers to
purchase life insurance that is owned by a ILIT.  "This technique works
particularly well if the individual is in their 50s, rather than their 60s,"
added Fleming.

Split Dollar.  Many of the more creative uses of life insurance involve
split-dollar insurance being used as compensation.  A split-dollar arrangement
basically allows the insured to pay the lower term value of a policy while the
employer pays for the cash-value part of the much higher premium.  What
usually happens is that the company pays the entire premium and then reports
income to the insured.  The amount reportable as income is based on tables
(PS-58 for individual policies and PS-38 for survivorship policies) or the
term equivalents provided by the insurance company.  No deduction is allowed
for the employer.  The net result is that the insured owns the policy and owes
the company the amount that it paid as cash-value premiums.  Normally, at a
later date (or at the insured's death) the company is paid back.

A split-dollar arrangement can be used for an owner of the closely held
business or for a key employee.  The cash value is growing tax-free and,
usually on retirement, if desired, the insured can withdraw premiums and even
take a loan against the policy.  As long as the policy is not surrendered, the
insured is getting a tax-free stream of income.  (Note:  The same tax-free
stream is available with normal respect to whole or variable life.)  Upon
death, the payout will be reduced by the amounts owed on the policy.  Fleming
said that split-dollar insurance is particularly attractive to transfer to an
ILIT "because the value of the gift subject to the annual exclusion is the
lower PS-58, PS-38 or term premium value."

Tom McCaskill, president of McCaskill & Associate, a family business
consulting firm in Wichita, Kansas, widely uses a variable split-dollar
insurance policy as the funding mechanism to pass the business to younger
generations when a business owner is alive.  He pointed out that a variable
policy allows the business to fluctuate the insurance premiums to a prescribed
maximum and also allows the insured to make the investment decisions with
respect to the policy.

Split-dollar arrangements are also used by large shareholders of publicly
traded corporations so that there are sufficient funds to pay estate taxes,
according to James Hodge, chairman of The Eyrie Group based in Danville,
California, a consulting company to first-generation business owners.  Hodge
makes an important point about all split-dollar arrangements that you want to
eventually rollout the company (end its premium payments).  He said that as
the insured gets older, the imputed income that the insured will have
increases if the company is paying the entire premium.

Life insurance is also widely used in cross-purchase agreements.  That is when
owners of closely held business purchase individual policies on each of the
other co-owners.  The problem is if there are five business owners, then each
owner has to buy four policies.  According to Fleming, many business owners
now use an escrow or partnership arrangement whereby only five (rather than
20) policies are purchased and the surviving owners each receive a portion of
the insurance proceeds, which are used to purchase the deceased business
owner's stock.

Bigger Hazards.  Although the benefits of life insurance are substantial, the
risks are also substantial from a tax standpoint.  McCaskill says there are
numerous pitfalls along the way that can trip up the plan.  One is that you
can overfund the premiums so that the IRS will say it is not an insurance
policy building up tax-free.  Also, there will be problems if the insurance
company imposes a penalty for a partial surrender or if a surrender is
considered by the IRS to be a complete surrender of the policy with a huge
income tax liability being imposed.

McCaskill said that a common problem he sees with split-dollar is that the
company and individual don't follow through and make a formal split-dollar
arrangement.

Ratner warned that you must particularly watch out for inflated expectations
about the rate of return of investments in variable life policies.  He added
that the amount of premium selected should be able to sustain the death
benefit even against poor performance of the investment.  He summed up his
concerns this way, "You don't want to make today's solution tomorrow's
problem."

BRIEFS


IIA rips internal audit outsourcing

ORLANDO, FLA.  - Terming the move by CPA firms into internal auditing "a
threat to the objectivity and independence of the audit process," the
Institute of Internal Auditors is calling on federal regulators to impose new
mandates on outsourced internal audits.

Companies should be forced to disclose the practice in their annual reports,
said IIA president William G.  Bishop in a letter to Securities and Exchange
Commission chief accountant Michael Sutton.

"If a public accounting firm performs all the internal auditing activities on
an outsourced basis, it becomes, at the very least, an indirect advocate of
management's assertion" over its internal control structure, said Bishop.

"An organization's external auditor cannot assume significant responsibilities
for performing internal auditing and, at the same time, retain its
independence in both fact and appearance," the IIA said in a new position
paper.


Coopers fees up 7% to $1.9 billion

NEW YORK - Coopers & Lybrand said its United States revenue for the year ended
in September gained 7 percent from 1994, to $1.905 billion.  Overall
consulting revenue gained 15 percent, led by a 45 percent growth in fees from
information and communications industry clients.  Business assurance services
gained 5 percent and the tax practice expanded 12 percent.  Worldwide, the
firm reported a 13 percent sales advance, to $6.2 billion.

U.S.  fee growth was led by a 30 percent gain in the firm's pharmaceuticals
and chemicals sector, 29 percent in media and entertainment, 20 percent each
in insurance and health care, and 15 percent in high tech.  The firm's human
resources advisory line grew 16 percent, to become one of the top five such
consulting practices in the nation, Coopers said.


Moss Adams acquires Kimball Dixon

SEATTLE - Regional firm Moss Adams has acquired local Medford, Wash., firm
Kimball, Dixon & Co., bolstering its West Coast presence.

The $59 million Moss Adams now has 17 offices from Canada to Mexico, with a
concentration in Oregon, said managing partner Bob Bunting.  "We're filling in
that I-5 corridor, growing geographically," he said.  "We've done very well
positioning ourselves as a dominant firm in small markets."

The six partners and 16 employees of the $2 million Kimball Dixon join Moss
Adams, said managing partner Ron Dixon, who initiated the merger talks two
years ago.


CLR buys PW tax software

CARROLLTON, TEXAS - Computer Language Research took another step to make
itself the dominant player in corporate taxation with the purchase of Price
Waterhouse's tax software line.

CLR acquired Price's TMS software for about $15 million.  The price includes
$11 million for the software and the remainder for accrued support liability.
CLR is also planning to hire from 125 to 135 Price employees.  By comparison,
CLR had 947 employees when it issued its annual report earlier this year.

Price Waterhouse has 1,200 TMS users, according to Price spokesperson Jan
Butler.  But that number includes licenses, which several individuals could
have access to at a particular site.  Butler declined to discuss TMS revenue.

Price also agreed that CLR's GoSystem 2 will be its exclusive in-house
preparation line.  CLR has a similar arrangement with KPMG Peat Marwick.  As
part of the extended transition, Price will dedicate the services of three
partners involved in TMS for the next four or five years.

Thomson adds SCS/Compute to Menzies' growing stable


by Robert W.  Scott


ST.  LOUIS - Looking for resources to compete more effectively in a
consolidating market, SCS/Compute will be acquired by giant Thomson Corp.  in
a deal valued at just over $30 million.

The acquisition is the latest in a number of notable deals announced in recent
weeks that signal increasing consolidation.  Others include the purchase of
CCH Inc.  by Dutch publishing giant Wolters Kluwer and Computer Language
Research's purchase of the TMS corporate tax business from Price Waterhouse.

SCS/Compute's own financial position in an increasingly competitive market was
clearly a factor in its decision.  "We've been strapped for resources," said
Robert Nolan, SCS/Compute's founder, chairman, president and chief executive
officer.

Nolan, who plans to remain president and chief executive, said all software
companies were facing strains from high- fixed costs.  "I think that is going
to be exacerbated by Windows development," said Nolan.

Thomson is assigning SCS/Compute to the Research Institute of America Group,
which includes Warren Gorham & Lamont and Practitioners Publishing Co., and is
headed by president Euan Menzies.  Thomson also owns Accounting Today through
a separate subsidiary.

RIA is getting an opportunity to develop a broad line of tax and accounting
products.  SCS/Compute has two tax software packages, LMS/Tax and Tax Machine;
a write-up package, Datawrite; and a growing number of client software titles.

Nolan agreed to sell his 1.1 million shares to Thomson U.S.  Holdings, a
division of Thomson Corp.  of Toronto.  Thomson has launched a tender offer
for another 1.5 million shares outstanding - all at a price of $6.75 a share,
up from recent trading at $2.375.

The deal will cost Thomson more than just the stock price of $17.5 million.
It must also redeem preferred stock and long-term debt owed to SCS/Compute's
major lender.

While growth in the tax preparation market has clearly reached a plateau,
Menzies said he sees opportunity.  "We are confident we can take market share
away from other companies," he said.

But RIA is not getting a market leader in SCS/Compute.

Industry sources rank SCS/Compute at about seventh place in terms of overall
market share.

But Nolan cited Thomson's deep pockets as an important aspect of the deal.
Harvey Stein, executive vice president of Pencil Pushers Software of
Burlington, Mass., agreed, saying "it gives them a base to acquire other
companies."

During the last year, SCS/Compute had made three acquisitions, to mixed
reviews.  SCS/Compute picked up, for example, In-the-Black software, a low-end
package it was forced to rewrite.  In the last quarter, SCS/Compute acquired
SaltWare, a sales tax line, for

$130,000 and stock now worth $54,000.  SCS/Compute also agreed in the last
quarter to buy RAM Software, a tax preparation line with 400 users, for about
$500,000.

FORECAST &REVIEW:  By the numbers:  The top 10 news events of 1995


Death and taxes.  The two constants made plenty of appearances in 1995's
accounting news.

Death claimed an independent Kenneth Leventhal and a logical way to account
for stock options.  Taxes - and what needs to be changed about them - were
discussed everywhere from executives' roundtables to kitchen tables.
Sometimes death and taxes came together, as in the cancellation of last year's
taxpayer compliance measurement program.

But all wasn't gloomy.  Experiments, such as KPMG Peat Marwick's Baymark, and
expansion, such as American Express Tax and Business Services' (dreaded, to
some) growth, breathed fresh air into this year's news.

Through it all, the American Institute of CPAs is undergoing a transformation
that should help members cope with all the issues raised by Accounting Today's
Top 10 stories of 1995.

1.  "Melancon rattles top ranks of AICPA":  When Barry Melancon replaced
long-time AICPA president Philip B.  Chenok July 1, he pledged to reduce
bloat, break down bureaucratic fiefdoms and modernize the institute's
operations.  But he surprised even his closest supporters in October when he
began a massive restructuring with a shake-up of top management ranks.  He
trimmed the number of executive staff positions and directors.  Additional
layoffs of from 5 to 10 percent were expected late last year.  The changes
were made, Melancon said, to focus on an area he targeted as important since
his nomination - delivering products and services members want.  The new and
improved AICPA also launched an advertising campaign aimed at making chief
executives and other decision makers in large companies think of CPAs as
business advisers.  An Accounting Today survey found that not only do CPAs
support advertising that would enhance their image, they would be willing to
spend more than the $3 million the AICPA budgeted for the program.  2.
"Overhaul or not, big changes loom":  If you can't guess what this headline
referred to, you were on a year's vacation.  Yes, alternative income tax
systems - especially the flat tax - were debated ad nauseam in 1995.  In
addition to a flat tax bill proposed by Rep.  Dick Armey, R-Texas, an
Unlimited Savings Allowance plan was proposed by Sens.  Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and
Pete V.  Domenici, R-N.M.  Others in Congress called for a national sales tax.
Whatever the philosophy, the message is clear:  The tax system must be
reformed.  And the experts say we're as close as we've ever been to a change
in the current income tax system.  Look for the issue to figure in this year's
presidential campaign.  3.  "Texas board sues American Express":  The Texas
State Board of Public Accountancy joined Florida in its crusade to stop
American Express Tax and Business Services Inc., formerly known as IDS
Financial Services Inc.  The board wants a Texas state court to forbid
American Express from signing its name to any financial statement that implies
that it is an accountant.  The statements also may not contain any wording
indicating it has expert knowledge in accounting unless it complies with the
Public Accountancy Act.  Under the act, the only business entity that can do a
compilation is a CPA firm.  American Express claims that the case is "all
about competition."  4.  "Tort reform leaps hurdle in Congress":  The
accounting profession - and the AICPA - were poised to win the battle for
litigation reform.  The bill would have reduced the financial liability of
accountants for fraud by their corporate clients and limited investors'
ability to collect damages from accountants and others with deep pockets.
Unfortunately, President Clinton vetoed the bill late last month.  5.  "Few
mourn as IRS kills TCMP audits":  A collective sigh of relief could be heard
from tax practitioners across the country in late October, when the Internal
Revenue Service announced it was going to indefinitely delay last year's round
of taxpayer compliance measurement program audits.  The IRS had planned to
select 153,000 tax returns and subject their owners to rigorous checkups, but
backed out after Congress refused to fund its entire $8.2 billion proposed
budget.  The IRS conducts the TCMP audits to gauge both the level of voluntary
compliance and the best methods for selecting tax returns for future audits.
The AICPA had been troubled by the IRS' plan to subject all individual TCMP
victims to a "financial status" test or "economic reality" check.  During a
financial status audit, taxpayers are quizzed to find unreported income.  The
so-called "economic reality" checks also caused headaches as practitioners saw
clients answering IRS inquiries about cash on hand at home, in a safe deposit
box or "hidden somewhere."  6.  "'Filing season from hell':  House panel rakes
IRS chief over coals":  The tax world was abuzz and aghast last tax season as
measures used by the IRS to detect fraud were holding up refunds and trying
taxpayer's patience from coast to coast.  Taxpayers claiming the earned income
tax credit didn't receive their cash credit until the IRS double-checked
taxpayers' and dependents' Social Security numbers.  Former H&R Block
president Harry Buckley called last year "without a doubt the most difficult
tax season" when it came to customer dissatisfaction.  Buckley blamed the
complaints on the "IRS' inability to effectively communicate the procedural
changes."  Taxpayers who paid extra to have their returns electronically filed
were especially aggravated at having to wait for their refunds.  7.  "Politics
kills FASB stock options plan":  After more than a decade of study and more
than two years of increasingly acrimonious opposition, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board dropped its plan to force companies to charge
executive stock options against earnings.  The FASB backed down only after it
became clear that pursuing its plan could prompt the Republican-controlled
Congress to seize accounting rule-making from accountants and place it under
government authority.  Constituencies in industry, especially high-tech
interests, claimed the change would have devastated "the fastest growing
segment of the economy.  In the end, the FASB voted to seek only footnote
disclosure."  8.  "Leventhal deal firms up Ernst's real estate muscle":  In a
deal that joined two real estate giants, Ernst & Young acquired Kenneth
Leventhal & Co.  Los Angeles-based Leventhal's operations, once the 11th
largest U.S.  accounting firm, are run as a business unit within Ernst &
Young.  Leventhal's departure left only three second-tier firms:  Grant
Thornton, McGladrey & Pullen and BDO Seidman.  9.  "With $1.9B sale, CCH gains
Dutch uncle":  CCH Inc., the nation's largest tax publisher, was acquired for
$1.9 billion by Netherlands-based Wolters Kluwer NV, a European giant, in a
transaction announced late last year.  The deal ended the 103-year reign of
the Thorne family over a business that now generates $600 million in revenue.
10.  "Peat makes grab for Wall St.  fees with franchise deal":  KPMG Peat
Marwick blazed a financial services trail when it launched an investment
banking unit, called KPMG Baymark, with a group of veteran Wall Street
investment bankers.  The unit is providing private placement debt and equity
financing to Peat's middle-market corporate finance clients.  While Peat
dreamed of the millions of dollars in fees Baymark could generate, some CPAs
questioned whether the firm could maintain its independence with clients who
have signed on to Baymark.

Ethics dilemma has two sides

This is in response to your story ("FBI douses report it wants CPAs to squeal
on clients," Aug.  21-Sept.  10) which refers to a USA Today article,
"Accountants should turn in crooked clients."

From these articles it is assumed that all three entities involved in this
dispute believe that CPAs have few ethical standards.  Your article also
suggests that CPAs are not turning in clients unless the behavior is "so
egregious" that in order for the CPA to avoid being tainted by it, he or she
contact the authorities.

According to the American Institute of CPAs Standards Rule 102 ammended May
20, 1991, "a member ...  shall not knowingly misrepresent facts or subordinate
his or her judgment on others."  Yet, they are following standards by not
informing the Federal Bureau of Investigation about clients because a member
cannot "disclose any confidential client information without the consent of
the client."  CPAs also fear the consequences of whistleblowing, such as
losing the confidence of their clients or, worse, getting fired by the firm.

One of the questions not answered in your article is, what reward is the FBI
willing to offer to CPAs if they do turn in their clients?  If CPAs are
greatly involved in a crime, they would also be prosecuted.  If prosecuted,
these CPAs would be terminated as members of the AICPA.  Arguments from both
sides should be presented in the same article.

Every time CPAs take on new clients, they should use their integrity to decide
whether to get involved with "dirty clients."  CPAs are obliged to protect
their clients, yet they cannot knowingly misrepresent facts.  If they
understand and remain objective, they should be able to control the problem.

Perhaps this issue could be resolved within the AICPA rather than by
outsiders, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission.  However, as
ethical and professional behavior will always be, this issue will remain
debatable.

Your report on Linda Pappajohn's recent speech at the AICPA Practice
Management Conference ("Clarity, ranges keys to compensation policies," Nov.
6-19, 1995) included some solid advice on salary issues and compensation
policies.  However, I want to share my surprise at the sample salary ranges in
the article, specifically for marketing directors, which range from a low of
$21,317 to a high of $28,778.

A quick call to Linda informed me that the salary ranges in the chart were
provided to her by the Minn-Dak chapter of the Association for Accounting
Administration.  During our conversation, Linda thought that the low ranges
may reflect the salaries of secretaries with little background in marketing
who have been promoted.

I don't know of a seasoned marketing director who will work within those
salary ranges.  In fact, according to a Gallop & Robinson poll, the average
annual salary for marketing directors in all industries is $80,478.  A loose
rule of thumb among marketing directors in various industries:  You should be
paid 1 percent of a company's gross.

Marketing directors in accounting firms often take on two other roles:
director of public relations - average annual salary $55,500, according to the
Public Relations Society of America - and director of advertising - average
annual salary $61,611, according to Gallop.  Even studies within our own
accounting industry, specifically the Pencor Report, publish that 17 percent
of full-time marketing professionals earn between $50,000 and $75,000
annually.

If there is any validity to the Minn-Dak ranges, it's no wonder that Lee
Berton of The Wall Street Journal reported recently that midsized firms are
having problems competing with the Big Six.  (Incidentally, Boulay, Heutmaker,
Zibell & Co.  is noted in Berton's article as a firm that is prospering by
fighting the Big Six on our own turf with advertising, promotional videos and
client satisfaction programs.)

Regardless of statistics, the truth is accounting firms need marketing
directors who will work as partners with firm management, challenging them to
increase business, market share, opportunities and awareness with marketing
programs and strategic plans.  And believe me, no marketing director of that
caliber will consider working for the salary ranges listed in the Minn-Dak
chart.

If accounting firms are settling for marketing directors with little, if any
experience, and basically leading them by the nose, they will get what they
pay for - small results within their comfort zone.  My advice to accounting
firms, especially since they usually hire one marketing professional and not a
whole department, is to hire the best you can afford.  In this age of fierce
competition, it's breakthrough marketing led by seasoned marketing pros that
will set apart the winners from the losers.

Boards must address unfair competition

The letter to the editor by Bernard Kiely, of New Jersey, ("State boards need
more power," Oct.  9-22) misses the major issue- the unfair competition that
purchasers such as American Express Business Services inherently have.

They are only buying accounting write-up and tax practices to ultimately sell
financial products to their clients.  That is why they can charge far less
than a CPA, who is prohibited by most state boards from doing the same thing.

The Federal Trade Commission was thinking along the same lines when it ruled a
few years ago that CPAs could sell financial products, with full disclosure,
to clients for whom they don't provide audit or review services.

Most state boards are like ostriches with their heads in the sand, living in
the regulated past, and will only be forced to go along with the FTC when
litigated to do so.

This is an issue that affects all CPAs, large and small.

Kevin A.  Lawrence, CPA Los Angeles



Mesonic thanks you for mentioning our Windows 95 Financial Accounting Software
in Tech Briefs ("Mesonic offers Windows 95 accounting," Sept.  11-24).  This
was the first mention in your publication of an accounting software vendor
shipping a Windows 95 accounting software package.

You can imagine our suprise when the next issue of Accounting Today reported
that another vendor claimed to have the first approved Windows 95 accounting
software ("SourceMate claims win with first Windows 95 accounting," Oct.
9-22).  Mesonic would like to challenge this claim.  Mesonic's Windows 95
version has been available since the beta days of Windows 95.

A stringent testing procedure must be successfully completed and verified
prior to a product being awarded the use of the "Designed for Windows 95"
logo.  This testing establishes whether or not a program is eligible to be
submitted to Microsoft for the Windows 95 logo.  Mesonic's software package
WINLine 95 passed this test Sept.  13, 1995.  Furthermore, this same article
states that, "SourceMate is field testing its Visual AccountMate with several
accounts ...  The product is scheduled to have several modules shipping in
November."

WINLine 95 is currently shipping 20 modules, several of which are available
without any wait.  Because WINLine 95 was derived from our NT version, which
has been on the market since 1993, your readers can be assured of a reliable
program and not a first-level release.

WINLine 95 accounting software by Mesonic is truly the "first Windows 95
accounting system" to both pass testing and to be available on the market.

AmEx KOs Fla.  board in CPA title bout

by Sandy Hock


TALLAHASSEE, FLA.  -- In a decision that's expected to sweep the country, a
federal judge ruled that an American Express Tax and Business Services Inc.
manager could call himself a CPA even though he works for a non-CPA-owned
company.

In doing so, Chief Judge Maurice M.  Paul of the U.S.  District Court for the
Northern District of Florida struck down Florida statutes that prohibit a CPA
employed by a nonlicensed accounting firm and performing only non-attest
business services from telling clients that he or she is a CPA.

"This decision will affect most states," said Sarah McKenzie, national
director of firm development and government affairs for Minneapolis-based
American Express Tax and Business Services.  "That's why we brought it to
federal court.  It was a constitutional issue."

In the wake of the decision, American Express was reportedly readying a
massive new expansion program.  The company finished fiscal 1995 in June with
$40 million in fees from about 341 professionals in 55 offices.  High-ranking
AmEx strategists were said to be formulating a plan to reach $200 million in
revenue by the end of the decade.

Chief Judge Paul ruled that the Florida regulation infringed on CPA Stephen
Miller's freedom of speech.

Miller, senior managing director of American Express' Tampa office and lead
plaintiff in the case, expressed relief that his 18-month court battle was
over.

"It's been a real tough year," Miller said after the judgment was handed down
last month.  "Everyone asks if I'm a CPA and I have to give them a lot of
explanation about the legalities of what I can tell them.  It puts a lot of
caution in their minds."

The Florida Board of Accountancy will vote on whether to appeal the decision
to the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta at its meeting
this week, said John J.  Rimes III, a Florida assistant attorney general.

"Obviously, the state isn't happy," Rimes said about the Miller case.  "We're
disappointed in the outcome."

Even with the Florida ruling, CPAs working for non-CPA firms should be careful
about how they refer to themselves, Rimes warned.  The U.S.  Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit in California ruled in September that the California
State Board of Accountancy could discipline a CPA affiliated with H.D.  Vest
investment securities for advertising his CPA credentials while also accepting
commissions.  Similar litigation also is pending in Texas and Louisiana, while
a preliminary investigation is underway in Arizona, Rimes said.

"It means there's some confusion out there," Rimes noted.  "There's no
question about that."

If the board doesn't appeal the decision, it could impose a disclaimer for
CPAs who work for firms that aren't regulated by the state, Rimes said.

If the Miller decision holds, it marks the third time in three years that the
Florida board lost a major case.  In June 1994, the U.S.  Supreme Court struck
down a Florida regulation forbidding attorney-CPAs from advertising their CPA
and certified financial planner credentials.  In 1993, the highest court
abolished the board's rule that forbade CPAs from such solicitation activities
as cold calling.

While conceding that fighting such issues as solicitation was an outdated
position, Florida Institute of CPAs executive director Lloyd "Buddy" Turman
insisted that CPAs are dead set in favor of the fight against American Express
on the Miller matter.

And the FICPA maintains that the issue involved is not simply allowing a CPA
to call himself one.  It goes deeper- to the very structure of firms - and the
profession.

"What you end up with is a noncorporate entity being able to provide services
without facing any consequences, except being sued," Turman said.  "Firms will
have a tendency to shuffle licensees in and out of a practice.  If a CPA gets
sued and his license gets revoked for substandard work, you just fire them.
There's no discipline that can be taken against the corporation."

This case, Turman said, "allows you to say you're a CPA, but you don't have to
act like a CPA."

Imagine, he said, a CPA in business who puts together real estate deals with
real estate professionals.  The CPA could take advantage of the "public's
trust for CPAs" by saying he is one, but not perform any of the work
associated with them.

For Miller, however, his case is about his freedom of speech.

"I should have been able to tell the truth," he asserted.  "It was always
awkward.  I'd have to say technically, I've earned my certificate, but the
firm I work for is not a CPA firm.  Unless you ask me, I can't tell you."
Miller, a former Big Six staffer and sole practitioner, began his long,
strange trip against the Florida board three years ago after the board
informed him it didn't like the language his American Express office had used
in a compilation report.  The state then came back jointly against American
Express, which at the time was still called IDS Tax and Business Services.

The action against Miller led American Express to file a suit against the
Florida board in state court in March 1994, charging that the board
discriminated against American Express by holding that its CPA employees could
not prepare third-party statements.  American Express claimed that since
Florida law allows anyone to prepare such statements, it was being unfairly
singled out.  American Express dropped its suit in September 1994 when the
board agreed to allow its CPAs to prepare third-party statements.

American Express renewed its legal efforts in November 1994 when, with Miller
as the lead plaintiff, it decided to test the constitutionality of Florida's
holding-out rule.

American Express had concluded that the June 1994 U.S.  Supreme Court decision
that allowed Orlando attorney-CPA Silvia Ibanez to publicly call herself a CPA
in turn gave American Express employees the right to hold themselves out.
Florida, on the other hand, maintained that the Ibanez case did not clarify
the holding out issue.  That attitude pushed American Express to refile the
suit.

Miller admits that American Express, even though it has only 18 CPAs and a
total of 40 employees in Florida, scares many CPAs in the Sunshine State - and
the rest of the country.

"It's what we represent," Miller explained.  "We're a big corporation with
money behind us.  We have the marketing and operations know-how that local
accounting firms don't.  They think that it gives us an unfair advantage."

In fact, since his legal tussles began, Miller has fielded many telephone
calls from CPAs interested in the American Express system and in hooking up
with the company.  A CPA Miller thought was "interested in joining the fold"
invited Miller and a staff member to visit his office.

"He was antagonistic from the start," Miller recalled.  "I said, 'Why did you
invite us over.' He said, 'You guys are the devil incarnate.  I wanted to know
something about the other side.'"

CONSULTING INSIGHTS:  Microsoft dominance leads tech trends for '96


Crystal balls are cloudy.  But one part of the technology horizon for 1996
remains clear:  it's a Microsoft (desktop) world.

There are technology trends that accountants should consider, such as the
evolution of color laser printing and imaging.  There are market trends,
particularly the continuing consolidation of vendors, that will have more
practitioners buying more software from fewer suppliers.  But in operating
systems and general desktop applications, there's little choice but Microsoft.

Particularly among smaller firms, 1996 is the year to choose whether to move
to Windows 3.1 or to Windows 95.  There's no reason to stick with DOS unless
you are using a computer you should replace, because both Windows 3.1 and
Windows 95 will run DOS applications (Windows 95 runs them very well).

If you are happy with Windows 3.1, stick with it.  There's no compelling
reason for buying 95, although its long file names and improved memory
management are nice, just not critical.

For larger firms, corporate America, consultants and resellers, the choice is
between moving to Windows 95 and Windows NT.  The latter offers stability,
robustness and security- pretty compelling reasons for making a business
decision.  Once Windows NT gets the Windows 95 interface later this year, it's
likely to be the product of choice for heavy- duty users and some consumers.

On the general application side, only in the accounting market is 1-2-3 still
king of the spreadsheet world, and that's not going to last.  Everybody else
uses Excel.  Anybody who attended shows such as PC Expo has got to wonder
about Lotus' (now IBM's) commitment to 1-2-3.  Both the product and name were
invisible in a sea of Notes signs.

And with Novell trying to sell WordPerfect, how many users want to bet on that
product's future in word processing?  The other choice:  WordPro, part of
Smart Suite.  Will that be Microsoft Word or Microsoft Word that your firm
buys?

The major question left in operating systems is whether Microsoft's NT Server
truly will displace Novell's NetWare.  It looks like 1996 will still be a year
of NetWare dominance, with strong gains by NT and the grudging co-existence of
the two products.

The one possible chink in the Microsoft armor:  on-line services.  The
Microsoft Network hasn't taken off yet and for professionals, CompuServe is
still a better service because there are more accountants to talk to on it.

On the Internet, Microsoft would like to repeat its dominance, but here it may
be cut off at the pass by Sun Microsystems and Netscape, both of which support
the Java programming language, an emerging standard.

Market consolidation

There will be more tax and accounting vendors failing or being purchased, with
tax preparation vendors particularly vulnerable.  The need to develop both DOS
and Windows products will simply prove too much for some smaller players.  Add
on likely tax law changes and some companies will simply count their cash and
go home.

Consolidation is not just about changing the number of players.  It's changing
how practitioners buy software.  Instead of buying from many small vendors, it
will be possible to buy a complete tax and accounting line from one source.

Look for the big to get bigger.  Intuit has been flexing its muscles with
development of programs and services such as the Intuit Financial Professional
Program for its Pro Series users.  That's the kind of power that one-product
companies will find hard to match over the long haul.

Movement towards suites will continue.  There is not a true accounting suite
on the market yet.  Micro Vision's Accounting Professional Suite is more of a
bundle of products with different pricing options.  However, true suites, with
build-in interfaces between products, are on the way.

Look for Computer Language Research, CCH Inc., Research Institute of America,
and perhaps Arthur Andersen with its new VantageSource unit, as well as a
number of smaller players, to join this race over the next two years.

The "I" word

Everybody is taking about the Internet.  Surprisingly, it isn't all hype.
But, it remains tough to sell and market most products on the Internet, unless
you are selling a specialty item.

However, the Internet appears to have a bright future in support, distribution
of upgrades and bug fixes, as well as good, old-fashioned electronic mail.

One of the companies pointing to the potential here is SBT Accounting Systems.
It accepts orders via its WebTrader, but since it sells on terms, it doesn't
have to worry about credit card security.

More important, SBT pioneered what founder Robert Davies calls "the poor man's
EDI" (Electronic Data Interchange) and hopes to use the Internet to seriously
cut product returns.

That combination of cost cutting and customer service represents the potential
for 1996.  And many tax preparation vendors are also recognizing the back
office/support potential.  Internet support is going to augment, if not
replace, some conventional bulletin board-based support systems.

Technologies to consider:

* Imaging.  Accountants are only now waking up to the cost of storing
documents.  Imaging is beginning to make an impact at smaller firms which are
the early adopters of technology.  * Video conferencing.  This has been a hot
topic in the broader computer market.  Pricing just hasn't come down enough.
In 1996, it's not quite there yet for smaller businesses and firms.  *
Hand-held computers.  If you didn't need them in 1995, you won't need them in
1996.  * Color laser printing.  The price is not yet low enough to make color
indispensable.  But it's getting close.  It won't be long before we all wonder
what anybody is doing with just a plain black ink printer.  * Wide area
networking.  Any firm with more than one office should at least look at
alternatives to plain old telephone service.

FASB rules on nonprofits' investments


NORWALK, CONN.  - The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued a new
rule on how not-for-profit organizations should account for certain
investments.

Statement 124, "Accounting for Certain Investments Held by Not-for-Profit
Organizations," is effective for fiscal years beginning after Dec.  15, 1995.
The statement is the fourth to result from the FASB's project to resolve areas
of inconsistency in accounting and reporting by not-for-profits.

Statement 124 requires not-for-profit organizations to report at fair value
investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values and all
debt securities, with gains and losses reflected in a statement of activities.
The statement also establishes standards for reporting losses on investments
held under a donor's stipulation to invest a gift in perpetuity or for a
specified term.

"Although a significant number of not-for-profit organizations currently
report all investments at fair value, inconsistencies exist because existing
guidance permitted alternatives," said FASB project manager Susan Weiss.  "The
board believes that fair value more accurately measures the resources a
not-for-profit organization has available to provide its mission-related
services."

Pentagon battles $20 billion in bad accounting


WASHINGTON - Financial record keeping at the Department of Defense is in such
disarray that the Pentagon can't account for more than $20 billion in military
expenditures.

But that's the good news, Defense financial officers told Congress.  As
recently as June 1993 the military had nearly $50 billion in "problem
disbursements" - payments which could not be matched with any obligations -
and dramatic progress has been made since then, they said.

As evidence, Pentagon officials noted that the department expects to overpay
defense contractors by "only" $270 million in FY 1995.  Two years ago,
military overpayments to contractors were approaching $800 million annually,
Defense Comptroller John J.  Hamre said in a letter to Congress.

For their part, however, members of the House government reform subcommittee
expressed little appreciation for the recent improvements in the department's
accounting systems.  Subcommittee Chairman Steve Horn, R-Calif., who summoned
a parade of military accountants to explain the Pentagon's chronically mangled
books, told Defense financial officers that in the private sector their
substandard accounting practices wouldn't pass muster even for "Mom and Pop"
businesses.

Democrat Carolyn Maloney of New York offered an even harsher appraisal,
calling the department's bookkeeping practices "a disgrace to American
fighting men and women."

Military financial officers acknowledge the extent of these problems, but say
they date back to before their watch.

"When I arrived, I learned that the department had serious problems in
matching obligations and disbursements," Hamre said, but these difficulties
"go back 50 years to the founding of the department."

Defense Inspector General Eleanor J.  Hill traced the Pentagon's bookkeeping
troubles back even further, noting that during the Revolutionary War, Army
quartermasters balked at financial record keeping on grounds that the military
could not be run like the "plain business of a common storekeeper."

Now "here we are 216 years later in the computer age and we still cannot
supply Congress with an acceptable accounting of expenditures," she said.

Further complicating the situation are the "flawed business practices that
have built up over the past 40 years" within the department's patchwork of
internal accounting systems.

When the department was created at the end of World War II there were more
than 250 major accounting systems in operation throughout the military.  Even
today, those systems remain "largely incompatible" with one another, and only
three of them comply with the Comptroller General's accounting principles and
standards, General Accounting Office assistant comptroller general Gene Dodaro
testified.

To make matters worse, the Pentagon adopted a policy authorizing any one of
the department's 300 financial offices to write checks on behalf of anyone
else in the department - a procedure that created a "cross-disbursing"
nightmare throughout the military.

As a result, checks were written without first verifying whether there was "a
clear path back to the accounting record in one of those 250 accounting
systems," Hamre explained.  "The result was a business practice [and a
culture] of 'pay now, account for it later,'" he said.

Despite these problems, department's comptroller disputed allegations that
"the department's finance and accounting systems are so flawed that you can't
trust the budget we have submitted to you."

Department officials also flatly deny suggestions that the military's
financial reporting mess is the result of any widespread fraud or misconduct.

Although GAO's Dodaro told Congress that CFO Act audits have revealed
continuing "breakdowns in the department's ability to protect its assets from
fraud, waste and abuse," Hamre disputed allegations of sinister intent.

"The bulk of our problems are the product of innocent mistakes inside a very
complex system where typographical errors produce thousands of mismatched
records that require subsequent research," he said in his letter to Congress.

5 New Standards Highlight FASB's 1995 Accomplishments


by Glenn Cheney


NORWALK, CONN.  - In 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board rode out
the turbulent wake of its stock compensation project and went on to pound out
five new standards and move several other projects into the public forum.

"All things considered, we made good progress this year," declares Dennis R.
Beresford, chairman of the board.

He has good reason for feeling satisfied.  In the first half of the year, the
board issued three new statements that would go into effect for fiscal years
beginning after Dec.  15, 1995.  Statement 120 established rules on the
accounting and reporting by mutual life insurance enterprises.  Statement 121
established the accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets.  Statement
122 deals with mortgage servicing rights.

By the end of the year, two more standards would be issued, and a number of
proposed standards would be released for comment.

Despite the progress, it was the stock compensation furor that attracted the
most attention.  Until the standard was issued in October as Statement No.
123, many companies, public accounting firms, certain commissioners of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and even the U.S.  Senate complained that
the proposed standard was unfair.  The original proposal would have required
companies to recognize stock option compensation as an expense.  The eventual
compromise required only a disclosure of the effects of such compensation.

According to Beresford, however, the fundamental issue was not the recognition
of stock compensation but the recognition of the sanctity of setting standards
in the private sector, a process that should not be influenced by politics or
economic effects.

"The question now is whether we are going to be commended for listening to
what a large majority said," he says, "or whether we will be condemned for
bowing to pressure and encouraging future efforts to get around the
private-sector standard-setting process."

Once stock compensation was out of the way, the board approved its last final
statement of the year.  It was a third standard in a series on not-for-profit
organizations.  Statement No.  124 requires reporting at fair value certain
investments in equity securities and all debt securities.  The new standard
went into effect for fiscal years beginning after Dec.  15, 1995.

Big October harvest

In October the board reaped much of what it had sown over previous months.  A
few days before issuing the stock compensation standard, the board issued an
exposure draft on consolidated financial statements.  If adopted as proposed,
the standard will prescribe when entities should be consolidated and how
consolidated financial statements should be prepared.

A few days later, the board released a special report on hedge accounting and
derivatives.  While it resolves none of the thorny issues that have hindered
progress on this project, it pulls together and analyzes many of the
principles and problems involved.  The board hopes to issue an exposure draft
on this important topic by the middle of 1996.

Then, within a week, the board issued an exposure draft of a proposed
statement on transfers of financial assets.  It resolves long-standing
questions about whether transactions should be accounted for as secured
borrowings or as sales.

Comments on the consolidation and transfers of assets proposals are due in
mid-January.

On a roll, the board issued an Implementation Guide on Statement 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," in
November and planned a draft on the decommissioning of long-lived assets by
the end of the year.  Originally the project had been dedicated to nuclear
power plants specifically, but in 1995 the scope was expanded to include
similar costs, such as those involved at mining or oil drilling sites.

International outlook

In 1995 the board continued to expand its efforts to shed international light
on FASB projects.

"Every project that we work on now has some significant interchange with our
counterparts in other countries," says Beresford.  "This is no longer
something that happens every few years.  It happens constantly."

The board ended the year with two exposure drafts of international scope that
are ready to go but on hold to keep them in step with offshore
standard-setters.  One, a proposed binational statement on disaggregated
disclosures, will not be issued until the board's Canadian counterpart is
ready to issue a parallel document.  The second, a proposed statement on
earnings per share, is ready but waiting for the International Accounting
Standards Committee to release a proposal on the same issue.

In the third quarter of the year the board tackled a key new project on
comprehensive income.  Deliberations have just begun, but the board is already
considering working with standard-setters in other countries to work toward a
standard with international compatibility.

An important document still out for comment deals with the effectiveness of
disclosures.  The board has been torn by conflicting complaints of burdensome
disclosure requirements and a perceived need for more information among the
users of financial information.

The board is also issuing an Invitation to Comment which addresses issues
raised in reports produced by the Association for Investment and Management
Research and the Jenkins Committee of the American Institute of CPAs.
Comments will do much to determine which projects end up on the board's agenda
in future years.

"We think there are some awfully interesting ideas in both of these reports,"
says Beresford.  "But there are so many ideas that we need to do some serious
prioritization."

At year's end, Beresford concluded that 1995 had been productive and had set
the stage for rapid output early in 1996.  Public response to the various
exposure drafts work will do much to guide the board through the new year.

FASB faces 2 departures, rushes to finish projects


NORWALK, CONN.  - After a busy season late in 1995, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board is planning to wrap up as many projects as possible by June
and then size up its future direction according to what needs to be done right
away and what ought to be done over the next several years.

June is a key month because two of FASB's seven board members will be
completing their terms at that time.  Who their replacements will be and where
they stand on various issues is at this point quite unknown.  The board,
therefore, is hurrying to complete most of its current projects while
forestalling work on anything new.

One of the two departing board members, Robert N.  Northcutt, has served as a
voice of experience in corporate accounting.  The other, Robert J.  Swieringa,
comes from an academic background.  The trustees of the Financial Accounting
Foundation are striving to find replacements from those same backgrounds.

"We're trying very hard to finish several of our most important projects
before the two Bobs leave so we don't lose all of the effort they've put in,"
says FASB chairman Dennis R.  Beresford.  "In particular, we'd like to issue
final standards on consolidation policy and procedures, and on transfers of
assets and servicing arrangements.  We also hope to issue an exposure draft on
hedging and derivatives."

A bit further into the future is the leave-taking of chairman Beresford, whose
term expires in mid-1997.  If Beresford has any pet projects he'd like to
escort through the long due-process of setting standards, he'll have to begin
early in 1996.

The board has recently been dedicating itself to strategic planning, something
that was difficult to do during the last decade of responding to the immediate
needs of accountancy.

"We're pretty far along in our strategic plan," Beresford says.  "Over time,
we expect to be more proactive in deciding where financial reporting should be
heading, as opposed to what has primarily been a reactive process.  We'd like
to focus more on tomorrow's problems and less on yesterday's and today's."

One aspect of the board's strategic thought is that the demand for and the
importance of financial reports seems to be declining.

"It has been suggested that instead of looking at nitty-gritty accounting
issues we should be looking at where the financial information package is
going and what part we should play in that," Beresford muses.  "I hope that
over the next year we will be able to develop our game plan for the next five
or 10 years."

Public guidance will come into play in the second half of the year as comments
come in on an Invitation to Comment.  The invitation is a report on action
that has been recommended by the Association of Investment Management and
Research and the Jenkins Committee of the American Institute of CPAs.  The
invitation asks commentators to prioritize possible projects that the FASB
might add to its agenda.

Six months of palpable progress

Between New Year's Day and the Fourth of July, the board hopes to make
palpable progress on a number of important projects.

The comment period for an exposure draft on consolidations policy and
procedures ends Jan.  15.  Public hearings are scheduled for Feb.  20 and Feb.
21, with a final statement possible in the second quarter.

The exposure draft of a statement on transfers of financial assets and
extinguishments of liabilities seeks comments by Jan.  22.  Public hearings
are scheduled for Feb.  26 and Feb.  27.  If all goes well, a final statement
may be issued by the middle of the year.

The board is hoping that an exposure draft on the closure and removal of
long-lived assets - formerly the project on nuclear decommissioning - also
might be finalized in June.  But, like all other projects, that depends on the
nature of comments received.

By June, the board also hopes to hammer out a long-awaited exposure draft on
hedging and derivatives.

The board plans to release two exposure drafts in January in conjunction with
other standard setters.

A proposed statement on disaggregated disclosures will be released in
conjunction with the Accounting Standards Board of Canada, and a proposed
statement on Earnings Per Share will be released at the same time as a
parallel document coming from the International Accounting Standards
Committee.

The FASB's project on comprehensive income was added late in 1995 and the
board has barely begun to grapple with the issues involved.  Nevertheless, an
exposure draft could be issued fairly early this year because the issues are
relatively limited.

The direction of the board in the second half of the year, then, should prove
interesting.  Two new board members will assume seats at the big table in
Norwalk, Conn., and some strategic thinking may have begun to congeal by then.
July 1, then, just might be springtime at the FASB.

PRACTICE MANAGEMENT FORUM:  For better recruits, target professors, survey
says


Across dozens of campuses nationwide, the battle for tomorrow's business
leaders has intensified.  Recruiting top talent has become more aggressive
than ever and the Big Six have recognized the need to bolster their marketing
efforts.

A consistent presence and favorable reputation with students is fundamental,
but, in this competitive market for superstars, not enough.  To gain an even
greater edge on campus, firms need to strategically target not only the
students, but their professors.

Although the Big Six routinely spend millions of dollars on faculty relations
programs each year, they are receiving a limited return on their investment.
With the exception of Arthur Andersen, which has consistently fostered strong
faculty relations, and Coopers & Lybrand with its recent faculty initiatives,
professors are not impressed.

A new study that measures the effectiveness of these programs reveals that
only a few firms are making a considerable impact.  These firms are spending
their dollars wisely and, in doing so, are positioning themselves to be the
firms of the future.

Until recently, the only method the Big Six had of measuring their reputation
among faculty was through surveys that polled accounting faculty at a large
number of schools.  This method ignores the changes in campus recruiting and
the concentration of resources.

Instead of casting a wide net across hundreds of campuses, many firms are
focusing their recruiting efforts on selected top schools.  In 1986, for
example, one Big Six firm reported hiring just 16 percent of its incoming
class from these top schools.

By 1990, it had hired 26 percent, and now it hires more than 45 percent of new
recruits from its focus schools.  Due to the Big Six's recent, more
specialized recruiting focus at key schools, the sweeping overview of data
collected in past surveys has become extraneous.

In addition, the manner in which the data is collected has caused some firms
to question the survey's accuracy.  To reflect the focused concentration of
campus recruiting and faculty relations, our firm conducted one-on-one
telephone surveys with 150 professors at 59 of the country's top accounting
schools.  The sample included schools such as the University of Chicago, the
University of Illinois, Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania and
the University of Texas.

To measure the faculty's perceptions of the Big Six, interviewers asked
straightforward questions such as, "which firm has the best relationship with
students and faculty on campus, which firm offers the best advancement
opportunities, and which firm is most successful in growing its practice?"
The study was first conducted in 1993 and repeated in 1995 with 70 percent of
the respondents participating in both.

Distinct tiers have developed

Although the faculty considered all the Big Six firms to be highly reputable
and, at times, difficult to differentiate, they regard Arthur Andersen as the
top firm overall.  Coopers & Lybrand solidified its second place ranking in
1995 by more than doubling its overall score compared to 1993.  Deloitte &
Touche also improved its overall score to place third, while Price Waterhouse,
Ernst & Young and KPMG Peat Marwick all lost votes in 1995.

Arthur Andersen's and Coopers & Lybrand's high rankings were no great surprise
given the tremendous energy and resources both firms devote to campus
recruiting and faculty relations.  Faculty members noted that Coopers &
Lybrand, especially, has increased their efforts to court professors.  Coopers
& Lybrand was ranked as the firm with the best relationship with faculty.  As
a whole, the faculty commented that they appreciated Coopers & Lybrand's
recent efforts to keep them apprised of new technical information.

Arthur Andersen was consistently regarded as the firm with the best
relationship with students.  Faculty perceived that the strength of the firm's
relationship with their students was in direct correlation to the high
offer/accept rate among their candidates.  KPMG Peat Marwick's ranking dropped
significantly compared to 1993, a reflection of their recent reduced campus
hirings.

In the categories of "growing its practice" and "technical reputation,"
faculty ranked Arthur Andersen as the top firm.  Some faculty connected the
growth of Andersen Consulting to Arthur Andersen diversifying its practice.
Faculty ranked Ernst & Young second in growing its practice, commenting
favorably on its May 1995 merger with Kenneth Leventhal & Co.  In terms of
technical reputation, Price Waterhouse slipped in overall votes compared to
1993, but still held its second place ranking.

Ranking brands of milk

For the firms that do not have an overwhelming presence or reputation, the
news is somewhat encouraging.  Because the faculty viewed all the Big Six as
reputable operations, they had some difficulty in rating the firms in areas
such as "best demonstrates technical expertise on accounting topics" or
"offers best advancement opportunities."

One professor commented that distinguishing between the firms in these areas
was comparable to "selecting their favorite brand of milk."

In other areas such as "best use of technology," professors felt that they did
not have sufficient information on which to base an opinion.  From the faculty
point of view in these areas, the field is still level and wide open.  For
firms willing to make investments in educating the faculty in these areas,
their reputation on campus may see a considerable jump.

The courtship of faculty is critical to building a firm's reputation and
talent pool for several reasons.  Fostering strong one-on-one relationships
with faculty provides an alternative pathway for firms to communicate with top
students.

Including the faculty in an overall recruiting program provides firms with
additional campus visibility as well as a means to educate faculty about
aspects of their firms.  When approached by students, professors will then be
able to offer valued and well-informed opinions about the career opportunities
available within any particular firm.

Professors with strategic ties to a firm tend to incorporate its data and
research more readily into not only their own personal research, but also
their curriculum.  Classroom exposure brings the firm to life and provides
students - a firm's future managers or potential clients - with in-depth
examples of a firm's capabilities and specializations.

In addition to financially supporting the accounting department, faculty
suggested other key components to building strong faculty relationships.
These include consistently recruiting and retaining their students, providing
technical information to assist in faculty projects, inviting professors to
participate in faculty-only symposiums, sharing leading-edge information and
fostering individual relationships over informal lunches.  Faculty commented
that a closer, working relationship allows for a more thorough flow of company
and recruiting information.

To reap a strategic advantage on campus, Big Six firms need to take an
aggressive approach in their faculty relationships.  Well-planned investments
will, in the long run, be money well spent.  With greater visibility and
reputation on campus, firms will be able to attract their future business
leaders and impress potential future clients.

HOT TIPS


SO GET SOME NEW MAGAZINES FOR THE WAITING ROOM:  For every complaint a medical
practice receives, 26 others go unreported, Dunbar, Cook & Shepard is telling
clients.

And according to the White House Office of Consumer Affairs, six of those 26
complaints are serious, the Indianapolis firm says.  As if that isn't bad
enough, each of those 26 unhappy patients will complain to about 10 other
potential patients.

TO OUTSOURCE OR NOT TO OUTSOURCE:  While outsourcing may be an easy road to
lower expenses and improved administrative methods, in the long run quality of
work, confidentiality and staff morale may suffer, Duitch, Franklin & Co.  is
warning its law firm clients.

Carefully weigh the benefits against possible drawbacks before deciding
whether to outsource, the Los Angeles firm advises.  Some issues to take into
consideration include:

* Credibility.  Any forthcoming vendor or freelancer will be happy to supply
your firm with references from other clients.  Check them, and talk to other
professionals.  But above all else, trust your instincts, and if you are
uncomfortable with a candidate keep the work in house until you find a
relationship you are comfortable with.  * Contract and pricing.  Make sure
your firm can get out of a contract, especially if the vendor's work is
unsatisfactory.  Review pricing structure - if it seems too good to be true,
it probably is.  * Staff morale.  Taking work away from a staff member simply
because he or she seems overworked may prompt fear rather than relief.  First
talk to the staff to see if any other alternatives may be more appropriate
than outsourcing.  At some firms, legal secretaries and administrative
assistants have banded together to form an "assistant pool" to help out
overworked coworkers in a pinch.  * Confidentiality.  Review your client
roster and caseload, and check off those clients who might object to their
work being outsourced and those matters that are too sensitive for outside
eyes.  * Damage control.  No one source is perfect - consider how well the
firm can rebound should an outside vendor suffer a major equipment or business
failure.  Determine the cost of salvaging an incomplete project.

DON'T TRUST THAT CRAZY UNCLE LOU:  While forming trusts can steer you out of
some sticky financial situations, naming a trustee can be tricky business,
Gikow Bierman & Talesnick is warning clients.  The Roseland, N.J., firm offers
a list of items to consider when choosing a trustee.

* Name more than one trustee, including a professional adviser.  While a
family member or close friend provides sensitivity to the beneficiaries'
needs, the professional adviser can provide financial accountability.  * Don't
word a trust agreement so that an individual trustee doesn't have to retain a
bond.  While waiving a bond may save the trust money, a bond is the only
protection against embezzlement or misuse of funds.  * Name a "trust
protector" - often a family friend - who can discharge a trustee under some
circumstances or veto some of the trustee's decisions.  * Allow for a change
of trustee in case beneficiaries move out of state.  For example, if the
beneficiaries move to a state that does not have income tax, they may still
have to pay state income taxes if the trustee lives in a state with income
tax.  * Write performance guidelines into your trust, allowing beneficiaries
to change trustees if they fail to meet a reasonable performance standard.

CompuServe campaign colors Block 2Q results


KANSAS CITY, MO.  - Marketing and expansion costs contributed to H&R Block
Inc.'s higher than expected loss of $8.3 million, or 8 cents a share, on
record revenues of $223.9 million for the second quarter ending Oct.  31,
1995.

That compares to a loss of $1.3 million, or 1 cent a share, on revenues of
$172.9 million for the second quarter ending Oct.  31, 1994.

The company had announced in August 1995 that it had launched a full-throttle
expansion of CompuServe, its computer services subsidiary.

"CompuServe's recent decision to lead the market in offering low-cost Internet
software and access and its agreement to become the exclusive on-line service
outlet for Time magazine are good examples of our aggressive focus," said
Richard H.  Brown, H&R Block Inc.'s president and chief executive officer.
"Our goal is to have nearly 5 million subscribers worldwide by summer."

CompuServe's revenues for the second quarter increased 37.9 percent to a
record $188.4 million, compared to the prior year's second-quarter figures of
$136.6 million.  The division's pretax earnings were $22 million, compared to
$34.3 million for the quarter ending Oct.  31, 1994.

In the second quarter, H&R Block Tax Services reported a pretax loss of $34.4
million, compared to $35.1 million for the quarter ending Oct.  31, 1994.
Revenues declined 0.5 percent to $27.6 million because of decreased enrollment
in the division's tuition tax school.  Brown noted that due to the seasonality
of the tax business, second quarter results are not indicative of the expected
results for the entire fiscal year.

TAXING ISSUES


IRS DISCUSSES LIFE IN A POST-TCMP WORLD:  Lou Carlow, Internal Revenue Service
Assistant Commissioner (Examination) updated a Dec.  5 meeting of the American
Institute of CPA's Tax Division on the IRS' plans for establishing audit
selection criteria in light of the agency's decision to cancel its taxpayer
compliance measurement program audits.  Carlow indicated that the IRS
currently has an internal task force"attempting to come up with a new system."
Meanwhile, Carlow said, the IRS will continue to rely on three sources for
identifying returns for potential audit:(1) existing DIF(discriminate
function) scores- derived from the last TCMP cycle in 1988; (2) information
from district and national office research projects; and (3) its emerging
market segment specialization program activities.


IRS FLIRTS WITH TAXABILITY OF FREQUENT FLYER MILES:  The IRS recently forayed
into the sensitive issue of whether the use of airline frequent flyer miles
consitutes the receipt of taxable income.  In a recent technical advice
memorandum, the IRS concluded that an employer's air travel expense
reimbursement plan didn't qualify as an "accountable plan" because it
affirmatively permitted employees to keep their miles.  Without "accountable
plan" status, expense reimbursements are included in an employee's income,
subject to withholding, and claimed by itemizers on Schedule A as a
miscellaneous deduction subject to the 2 percent floor.  It is worth noting
that the plan in question specifically stated that employees were permitted to
keep the miles they accrued on business travel.  The TAM generated
considerable public and media attention, and subsequent to its release, IRS
commissioner Margaret Milner Richardson is reported to have told a group of
practitioners that the national office currently has no projects in the
"frequent flyer" area.  (TAM 9547001)

401(K) FRAUD TARGETED:  Labor Secretary Robert Reich announced a campaign by
the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration to crack down on fraud in
401(k) plans.  The anti-fraud effort includes both 300 pending investigations
and a consumer education program targeted against employer misuse of 401(k)
funds.  Some of the "10 warning signs" contained in the consumer education
campaign:late 401(k) statements, former employees having trouble getting
benefits paid and contributions held by an employer for more than 90 days.

FINAL PT PREGS ISSUED:  The IRS has released final regulations under Code
Section 7704 applicable to publicly traded partnerships (PTPs) that define
"established securities market" and a "secondary market or its substantial
equivalent."  The regulations also modify and extend existing safe harbors
from PTP treatment.  The final regulations largely follow earlier proposed
ones.  The preamble to the final regulations also indicates that the IRS is
considering guidance on definitions relating to the PTP exception for certain
partnerships with passive income, and has asked for public input on what the
proposed guidance should look like.  (T.D.  8629)

IRS DELAYS '96 WITHHOLDING FORMS:  The IRS has announced that it is delaying
the issuance of the 1996 Form W-4 due to the possibility of tax law changes in
the pending budget bill that may have an impact on an employee's withholding.
The IRS is asking taxpayers to continue using, and employers to continue
accepting, 1995 forms.  The IRS said that it plans to issue new forms as soon
as possible once legislation is finalized.  (Ann.  95-104)

J.D.  Edwards looks to find resellers for Genesis line


DENVER - J.D.  Edwards, which specializes in AS/400 software, has joined the
ranks of companies seeking resellers for its financial line.

Earlier this year the company released Genesis for companies with annual
revenue of $10 million to $100 million.

"It's relatively price competitive with PC-LAN [accounting software]," said
Rick Byrne, director of Genesis operations.

Genesis marks a departure for J.D.  Edwards, which had previously concentrated
on selling enterprise-wide systems on the AS/400.  But it is in line with the
movement of other higher-priced accounting packages into what is referred to
as the middle market.  That market is roughly defined as companies with
revenue of from $10 million to $500 million.

Genesis includes financial, distribution and manufacturing software that can
be sold as a suite.  The manufacturing suite includes distribution and
financials.  Distribution software includes financials.  Byrne said a 20-user
distribution system would cost more than $50,000.

Although many accounting consultants make sales in that price range, many are
not experienced in AS/400 software.  However, there are a few firms which will
be able to play in that arena.

"To play, you've got to have familiarity with that system and have grown up
with the System/34 and 36 world," said Jim Metzler, partner and consultant at
Gaines, Metzler and Kriner, of Buffalo, N.Y.  System/34 and 36 are the older
IBM minicomputers which IBM largely replaced with its AS/400.

Metzler said only a handful of firms do AS/400 consulting, including his.
Metzler's firm also sells the hardware.  He said that the AS/400 is "easier
from a complexity perspective than many networks," but that historical price
points scare away firms.  He views the AS/400 as more cost-effective than
PC-LAN networks, especially for "clients who need multi-tasking and minimal
care and feeding."

Metzler's firm resells and installs software from Daily & Wolcott, a
competitor of J.D.  Edwards.

Genesis supports Windows clients and is Windows 95 compliant, Byrne said.  The
software will operate in both PC and terminal environments.

More recently, J.D.  Edwards introduced the OneWorld line, a follow-up to its
World software.  OneWorld is a client/server package, which expands support of
hardware to work stations running Microsoft NT Server.

More expensive than Genesis, OneWorld is likely to be streamlined in the next
year to 18 months for a version that will also be available to resellers.

With more low-end releases, vendors eye reseller programs


Santa Claus left a bundle of new low-end accounting software packages under
the tree and visions of new programs for accountants danced in vendors' heads
through the New Year.

In time to welcome 1996, Intuit, Peachtree, BestWare, New England Business
Service, Computer Associates and DacEasy all introduced new versions of their
small business accounting packages.

And those vendors who don't actively recruit CPA firms as resellers or
recommenders were eyeing how to structure programs in order to involve firms.

"We're working on a formal recommender program," said Drew Paxton, Intuit's
International Project Manager, Business Products Group.

Similarly, David Dalton, director of marketing for 4Home Productions, said his
company will investigate a CPA program for its Simply Money.

It's very clear what's at stake.  As NEBS introduced its One-Write Plus
Version 5.0 for Windows, it said that 50 percent of One-Write users say an
accountant recommended the purchase.  One-Write has been particularly strong
in this group in supporting a consulting program.

BestWare of Rockaway, N.J., already had an active channel program for its
M.Y.O.B.  Accounting software, but recently appointed its first Consultant
Program manager.  DacEasy has about 300 certified consultants, many of whom
resell.

Rob Hartlage, a CPA who operates Asystants, a Sellersburg, Ind.-based
consulting firm, said many accountants don't understand the opportunities
low-end consulting offers.

"They [accountants] wonder why someone would pay $99 for a package and then
spend $500 to $1,000 to help use it," said Hartlage.  "They will."

Hartlage consults for DacEasy software and does some limited work with Quicken
and One-Write Plus.  He said despite all the effort to make accounting
software easier to use, clients need someone to help them get started.

Paxton's comments came as Intuit introduced new versions of its line with
QuickBooks 4.0 and QuickBooks Pro 4.0.  There's one change, though- Intuit has
dropped its claim that QuickBooks is bookkeeping software and now aggressively
touts it as accounting software.

Although Intuit claims more accountants recommend QuickBooks than any other
software, the company has not formally enrolled firms in the process.

That's likely to change.  Intuit has already established its Intuit Financial
Partner Program, which seeks to give referrals to CPAs.  The first year was a
bit slim:  10,000 firms signed up, but Intuit only got 7,000 referrals.  The
company hopes to triple referrals this year.

4Home Productions, the small-business, consumer software arm of Computer
Associates, is also looking at establishing a consulting or recommender
program or both, according to David Dalton, director of marketing.

Low-end accounting software is getting more robust, particularly more
customizable, and supposedly easier to use.  But forays into vertical markets
by these vendors may offer accountants more chances to develop consulting
opportunities.

Most of these products allow the user to modify fields in reports or entry
screens or both and to pick from sample charts of accountants from differing
types of businesses, which can be used as templates.  Particularly popular is
the ability to reorder or hide fields.

Drag and drop editing of fields is increasingly popular.  Simply Accounting
for Windows 4.0 from 4Home productions use drag and drop on the home screen.
M.Y.O.B.  6.0 from BestWare supports drag and drop modification of report
fields while DacEasy Accounting & Payroll 95 offers the capability for forms.

This is one of the few areas where the competitors are ahead of QuickBooks,
which requires the use of a dialogue box to rename fields.

Easier setup is also a common goal.  With the Windows version of One-Write
Plus, users set up companies through an interview process.  Intuit of Menlo
Park, Calif.  also has adopted the interview form with QuickBooks and
QuickBooks Pro, while Peachtree Software of Norcross, Ga., carried the
interview setup into the world of multimedia with video and audio clips.
BestWare has used the interview approach since version 4.0 of M.Y.O.B.

In DacEasy Accounting & Payroll 95, DacEasy of Dallas, takes a page from
Windows in offering the Easy Setup Wizard.

QuickBooks Pro is trying to claim unique customization abilities to allow
users to tailor documentation and features for more than 20 different
industries.

Users, said Paxton, "are looking for something that can be made specific to
their businesses."  While other packages provide charts of accounts that can
be used as templates, QuickBooks offers custom documentation for niches, such
as construction.

To a certain extent, 4Home is simply trying to keep pace.  Dalton admitted his
company fell behind its development cycle.  But he added, "I think we'll come
back strong."

Simply Accounting adds the ability to store both prior and current year's
fiscal data and print comparative financial reports.

Besides its customization features and set-up interview, Nebs expanded on-line
help and provided expert definitions of financial and accounting concepts.

DacEasy lays claim to being the first of the group to design its system for
Windows 95.  It offers 100 business templates and offers report customization
through a Report Wizard.  Like QuickBooks, the latest DacEasy software also
includes time and billing and contact management features.

M.Y.O.B.'s report customization is similar in offering more than 100 templates
and enabling drill-down analysis.  It provides time and billing information
less directly, offering the Timeslips Accounting link to pull time and billing
data from Timeslips.  M.Y.O.B.  has also added the ability to import data from
Quicken.

ACTION IDEA:  How to have a successful seminar


Even if you've managed to attract half the business community to your seminar,
your efforts are far from finished.  Not only do you want the attendees to
enjoy the session, but enjoy it enough to attend another one.  Here are some
tips:

* The place - The room should have no distracting elements, and should
accommodate your guests when seated as well as gathered on breaks.  Arrange
seating so attendees participate.  Lighting must be adequate.  Offer
refreshments.  * The program - Distribute handouts so the audience can follow
along.  Humor goes a long way toward holding interest; so does audience
interaction.  Schedule regular breaks, about every 45 minutes.  * The follow
up - Distribute and collect evaluation forms, and respond personally to any
extremely positive or negative evaluations.  Make sure all attendees in your
marketing database receive firm correspondence.

Budget worries kill workload relief bill


WASHINGTON - The chance that workload compression relief will come to small
CPA firms soon is slim.

A provision that would have allowed partnerships and S corporations to choose
their own fiscal year didn't survive the final conference budget bill Congress
handed to President Clinton.

"It was a major disappointment," said Gerald W.  Padwe, vice president of tax
for the American Institute of CPAs.

The AICPA had been the major backer of the provision, which would have allowed
the pass-through entities to make quarterly estimated tax payments on behalf
of their owners.  The owners would be relieved of quarterly payments if their
companies paid for them.

While the proposal was included in the House of Representatives version of the
budget, its price tag probably forced it to be dropped during conference bill
discussion.  According to Padwe, the AICPA was told the provision would have
cost $335 million through five years.  Another estimate quoted by Lindy Paull,
majority staff director of the Senate Finance Committee, said the bill would
cost $355 million over seven years.

Either way, it's not a phenomenal total when you consider the size of the
budget.  But it was worth enough to be used as part of the budget bargaining
bonanza.  Padwe speculated that the provision was axed when Rep.  Bill Archer,
R-Texas and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, had to find ways to pay
for making the proposed capital gains tax cut retroactive to Jan.  1, 1995.

Rep.  E.  Clay Shaw, R-Fla., the original sponsor of the provision, has told
AICPA leaders he'll try to get the proposal reinstated if they can devise a
way to make the workload compression plan revenue neutral.  Padwe, however,
takes a fatalist's view on Shaw's chances.

"We would love to see it come back," Padwe said, "but as a practical matter,
they say when something has fallen out of a bill it's hard to get it back in."

Although the AICPA's outside economist projected that the workload compression
proposal wouldn't drain tax dollars from the system, the Joint Tax Committee's
prognosticators came up with the $355 million mark.  The reason?  According to
the terms of the current provision, the quarterly estimated tax payments would
be made at the 34 percent level.  If a taxpayer owns all the shares of an S
corporation and is in the 31 percent bracket, why would he want to make the
payments?  On the other hand, if the same taxpayer were in the 39.6 percent
bracket, he would be more than happy to pay the 34 percent.

"He'd say, 'I'm getting the use of that money until next April,'" Padwe said.

That's what ends up costing the government those millions.  (The AICPA is now
proposing to increase the tax to 35 percent.)

Padwe still hasn't given up hope.  This year the 104th Congress is still in
control, so the AICPA doesn't need to find another champion for the bill.
Unfortunately a presidential election year isn't the best time to find a tax
bill, which is the typical vehicle to attach this provision to.

"It's not a bill you'd expect to stand alone," Padwe said.  "It's going to be
hard to find 500 congressmen to say, 'This is the most exciting thing I've
ever seen.  Quick, let's pass it.'"

Congress passes tort reform bill with veto override


WASHINGTON -- Much to the relief of the American Institute of CPAs, Congress
voted to overturn President Clinton's veto of securities litigation reform.

The president had vetoed the legislation, which shields independent
accountants from abusive liability damage awards.  The veto shocked bill
supporters, including the AICPA.

The bill sailed through Congress last month as the House and Senate raced to
adjourn the 1995 legislative session.  Final passage of the bill - a top
lobbying priority for the Big Six accounting firms during each of the past two
Congresses - was "testament to the widely held belief that the tide of
frivolous securities litigation in this country must be stopped," AICPA
officials said.

A key provision of the bill for the accounting profession places new
restrictions on the ability of plaintiffs to use the "joint and several"
standard of liability for extracting huge damage awards from CPAs when other
defendants in the case are unable to pay their portion of the damages.

Instead, the legislation establishes a system of "proportionate liability"
under which accountants and other peripheral defendants will be expected to
pay only their fair share of a judgment.

That proportionate liability shield isn't completely bullet-proof, however.
Small investors will continue to be allowed to sue based on the "joint and
several" liability standard, and accountants who knowingly participate in a
securities fraud will remain subject to full "joint and several" liability.

Additionally, even in the proportionate liability cases, CPAs would be
required to pay up to 150 percent of their proportionate share of damages when
another defendant is insolvent.

At the same time, the legislation also contains a number of provisions to
ensure that accountants and other business advisers are held accountable in
cases where they knowingly permit their clients to engage in securities fraud.

The final version passed by Congress amends portions of the U.S.  Supreme
Court's controversial 1994 Central Bank decision to restore Securities and
Exchange Commission authority to bring "aiding and abetting" cases against
CPAs for knowingly violating federal securities law.

A separate provision of the bill codifies a key recommendation by
investigators of the savings and loan crisis that would require outside
auditors to disclose suspected client fraud to the appropriate enforcement
agency.

For his part, AICPA President Barry Melancon called the final bill "a fair
balance between the rights of truly defrauded investors and those start-up
companies and outside professionals who have become victims of a small group
of entrepreneurial lawyers abusing the legal system."

Passage of the legislation drew a sharply different reaction from critics of
litigation reform.

Consumer Federation of America Chairman Howard Metzenbaum attacked
congressional supporters of the bill for "carrying the ball for some very
special interests who only have a selfish financial interest to protect.

"The securities industry, accountants and corporate insiders are far less in
need of protection than is the small investor in the marketplace," he said.

In contrast, congressional advocates of the litigation reform measure
contended that the legislation would have increased investor control of class
action securities suits "so that settlements benefit the plaintiffs and not
just the plaintiffs' attorneys."

According to representatives of Sen.  Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., the bill's
chief sponsor, under the current system "investors generally receive only 7 to
14 cents per dollar of loss, and only after the plaintiffs attorneys take
their fee off the top."

To address this problem, the bill eliminates the "lodestar" approach to
calculating fees, under which "attorneys get to skim right off the top of a
settlement award," they said.  Instead, lawyers will be allowed to pocket only
"a reasonable percentage of the award they obtain for their clients."

In addition, the legislation includes provisions to:

* create a uniform pleading standard by adopting guidelines established by the
U.S.  Second Circuit Court of Appeals; * restrict the use of "professional
plaintiffs" in class action securities lawsuits; * require more complete
disclosure of settlement arrangements to enable plaintiffs in class action
suits to make informed decisions about attorney's fees; and * encourage more
meaningful corporate financial projections by establishing a new SEC-supported
"safe harbor" for forward looking financial statements.

TAX PRACTICE:  Former Navy CPO sails into friendly tax prep waters


RICHMOND, VA.  - Rob Stepp went from looking for submarines to searching for
tax deductions.

The former Navy chief petty officer bought one Jackson Hewitt Tax Services
franchise and purchased the rights to open four more offices in the Richmond
area five years ago.  He's also planning to open a kiosk at his local Wal-Mart
this tax season and to add two more storefronts by next tax season.

After a decade in the Navy as a sonar technician, Stepp found that his
enthusiasm for accounting hadn't waned.

"All my life, I've loved numbers," Stepp said.  "Math was my favorite subject
in school.  I never used a calculator."

Stepp was still in the Navy, stationed in Virginia Beach, Va., when he was
inducted into the Jackson Hewitt system.  Because he received computer
training in the military, a friend in town asked if Stepp could help iron out
a few technology bugs at her tax practice.  His assignment was supposed to
last a few days, but ended up growing into a part-time job.

Stepp caught tax preparation fever, which led him and his wife, Helen, to
acquire the existing Richmond office and open four new locations in nearby
neighborhoods.

"We wanted these surrounding territories because they had no competition for
years," Stepp said.  "There were only H&R Block, CPAs and accountants.  The
average taxpayer doesn't need a CPA or accountant to do his taxes."

But the Navy didn't equip Stepp with the practical skills needed to run a
business.

"You get into the military and you've got a sure paycheck," Stepp noted.  "You
won't get laid off.  The biggest thing you have to do is show up."

The hardest part was hiring a staff, Stepp recalled.  Finding qualified
candidates and going through the interview process was a chore.  And
determining a salary scale was a nightmare.

"If they had experience working at H&R Block, it wasn't fair to pay them
beginners' wages," Stepp said.  "In the military you don't have that.  You're
paid according to your rank."

The first months were tough.  At the time, some of Stepp's more than 60
employees had a lot of experience, some had "just basic training" and some had
tax knowledge, but no computer training.

"It was quite a year," Stepp said of his May 1991 to early 1992 adventure.
"I'm glad it's over."

In retrospect, Stepp said he should have taken more time to expand his
business, which now employs 90 workers in tax season and eight after May 15.
Stepp's offices handled 5,800 clients during the 1995 tax season.

His advice to first-time business owners:  Find someone experienced who can
work as an assistant.  He also suggests that novice business owners advertise
in their local newspaper.

Stepp credits his practice's success - he won Jackson Hewitt's annual customer
service award - to the cheerful atmosphere in his offices.

"We hire happy, upbeat receptionists," he said.  "If you get a bad reception,
you can forget about seeing that client."

In the interest of customer satisfaction, Stepp and his staff spent last
summer calling all their clients to ask if they had any problems with the
practice's service during the 1995 tax season.  Nationwide, taxpayers suffered
through refund delays because of fraud checks involving the earned income tax
credit and Social Security numbers.

Those who said they had a problem were asked for suggestions on how the
service could be improved.  The clients also received a certificate for the
free preparation of one tax return.

"People were angry at all tax preparers," Stepp said about the 1995 tax
season.  "Once they found out that we didn't know that the Internal Revenue
Service kept these procedures under wraps, they were OK.  Their biggest
complaint is, 'I want a bigger refund.'" Even the Navy couldn't help customers
with that one.

Dealing with customers also was new territory for Stepp to explore when he
left the Navy.  And while he succeeded in civilian life, Stepp concedes that
it's not always easy for those leaving the military to find a fulfilling
second career.

"The real work is difficult to handle," Stepp said.  "In the Navy, someone was
always there to tell you what to do."


Editorial:Flunking the test

The CPA exam needs reform

The night before accounting school grads take the CPA exam, they should pray
for one of two things:  acute accounting knowledge or the luck to take the
test with a pack of boneheads.

Either way, they'll do fine.  That's because the American Institute of CPAs,
which administers the Uniform CPA Examination, uses a quota system to rate CPA
candidates.  First, those scoring 75 percent correctly on the test are
automatically in the CPA club.  But, if those scoring 75 and above are not
equal to 30 percent of the test takers, grades often in the 60s are simply
rounded up to 75 to meet the 30 percent quota.

It sounds like a strange way to introduce a new crop of young adults into a
profession that prides itself on precision and integrity.  The exact mechanics
of it all even escapes the comprehension of two out of three state regulators
surveyed by the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy.

But the results of the May 1995 exam have sent the issue to the front and
center for many state regulators.  In last spring's exam, grades were adjusted
to make 62 the pass point on two sections of the test, but no adjustments were
made for candidates who scored less than 75 on two others.  By one estimate,
6,000 of the 61,650 candidates who might have passed the test were flunked so
the AICPA could make its 30 percent target.

The South Dakota board complained that it is only a matter of time before a
legal challenge is made to this procedure.  The board is right.  It would be
tough to explain to a candidate that he or she flunked just because he or she
is smarter than only 69 percent of those taking the test.

It's time that NASBA and the AICPA put an end to the quota system.  Both
groups should work together to create a new system involving, first, a test
that reliably measures proficiency year after year, and second, a definitive
passing score that requires no curving to meet an arbitrary, monopoly-imposed
quota.

Every candidate must be assured of a fair test.


LETTERS FROM EXAM CANDIDATES:

Exam results 'tough to swallow'

Thank you for the shocking revelation about the CPA exam ("Fight over CPA exam
tests the testers," Nov.  20-Dec.  10, 1995).  I was greatly disturbed and
deeply saddened after reading your report, because I could have been one of
the 6,000 candidates who otherwise would have passed the test with grade
adjustment.  I scored 67 on the May 1995 Financial Accounting Section - my
last paper to pass, on which, according to your report, 66 was the passing
point after grade adjustment.

Despite the fact that I hit 68 a few times in other papers, I never questioned
the grading system.  I forced myself to admit that somebody did better than I,
therefore, I did not deserve to pass and had to study harder.

The May 1995 result was very tough to swallow, even more so after I read your
article last night.  I feel most sorry for my wife and two children, for all
the sacrifices, understanding and encouragement they put in for me.

David P.  Sin Scarborough, Ontario


I was a November 1995 candidate for the Uniform CPA Examination.

This was my ninth time taking the exam due to the fact that I have been out of
college for more than 10 years.  However, through studying for and by retaking
the exam, my scores have shown a certain degree of improvement toward the 75
percent passing score.

My reason for contacting you is that I have become very concerned about the
grading process which is used to determine the actual percentage that is
deemed passing or failing on the exam and how that percentage is determined.

Most CPA review course admininstrators tell their students that a 67 through
69 score is graded upward to a passing 75 percent, yet, on the May 1995 exam,
I received a score of 69 on the Business Law section.

In a recent special report in Accounting Today, (Fight over CPA exam tests the
testers," Nov.  20-Dec.  10, 1995) the following points were brought to my
attention as a CPA exam candidate:

* It is stated that "if less than 30 percent of the candidates score 75
percent, the failing grades are curved upward to assure that at least 30
percent pass."  * A 65 might be a passing grade in one year but not in the
next.  * On the 1993 exam, candidates answering only 65 percent of the
questions correctly on the Accounting Theory exam were given grades which were
curved upward to a passing 75 percent.  * On the 1992 exam, a 52 score was
curved upward to a passing 75 percent.  * On the May 1995 exam the grades were
adjusted to a make the passing grades 62 on the Accounting and Reporting
sections and 66 on the Business Law and Auditing Sections.  Thirty-five
percent were allowed to pass on this exam.

With reference to this article, on the May 1992 exam, I scored over 52 on
three sections of the exam.

I would like to know what criteria is used to determine which candidates are
to be included in the 30 or 35 percent passing rate and how the subjects in
which they are allowed to pass are determined.

I have become very concerned about the grading procedures due to the fact that
my grades have only increased by a very small margin in six of the nine times
in which I have taken the exam.  In at least three instances, my grades were
almost exactly the same.  I was a little concerned at this point.

After receiving my scores for the May 1995 exam, and also after reading the
article, I became very disturbed that only a percentage of candidates are
allowed to pass the exam, even if a 69 through 74 score is obtained.  I am
sure this is also very disturbing to other candidates who have scored in this
range.

What is even more alarming is that no one knows how, in any given year, the
pass point is determined.  Personally, it makes me feel as though I am
shooting in the dark, yet never hitting anything.

As important as this exam is to accountants and to entry into the profession,
I feel that as a CPA candidate and, certainly, one who has studied in order to
master this area of learning, there needs to be a better understanding of the
grading system which is used to determine our career paths.

Study finds employers liable for $95B error on non-exempt employees


WASHINGTON - A new study suggests that the potential annual private sector
overtime liability for misclassification of exempt status under the Fair Labor
Standards Act is $1.8 billion per week, or $95 billion annually.

The Employment Policy Foundation's study is based on Census Bureau wage and
hour data and assumes that all white collar employees now classified as exempt
were in fact non-exempt.

Kenneth L.  Deavers, the author of the study and the conservative group's
chief economist, notes that such an outcome might be considered to be extreme,
"but was seriously considered by the Minimum Wage Study Commission in its 1981
report."

In a more immediate and consequential sense, the study shows that potential
employer liability for overtime pay could be substantial, the group said.

Because employers found to have misclassified non-exempt employees as exempt
are liable for two years back pay under the FLSA, the liability for back pay
could be $1.9 billion for each 1 percent of the white collar workforce found
to be non-exempt.  And, if the violations were found to be willful, the back
pay liability extends to three years and the award is doubled.

Deavers describes the existing Department of Labor definitions and tests for
determining exempt status as "so arcane and subjective they lend themselves to
employer misunderstanding and possible administrative manipulation."

Deavers goes on to say that "if firms incorrectly categorize employees as
exempt, or in some other way disqualify employees from exemption, they are
liable for back pay for overtime and, in some cases, punitive damages.  It is
these potential costs that motivate firms to push for clear-cut rules
determining exempt status under the FLSA."

"The definitions used to determine who is an exempt employee have not changed
for nearly 50 years, despite the revolutionary changes in the workplace,"
according to Edward Potter, the group's president.  "Under the present system
of subjective definitions, an employer never knows whether it has properly
classified employees until after an administrative review lawsuit.  Clearly,
the FLSA exemption should reflect the characteristics of modern-day work:
increasingly knowledge based, requiring independent judgment on the part of
the workers."

AICPA, AT&T cite businesses


DETROIT - The American Institute of CPAs and AT&T Capital have awarded $50,000
in grants to three local entrepreneurs to help finance their businesses.

The Partners for Growth grants were given to a new basketball facility for
inner-city teenagers, the owner of a bookstore and coffee house dedicated to
increasing cultural awareness within the African-American community, and to
the president of a minority-owned environmental chemistry consulting firm.

Partners for Growth, which began in 1994 as a pilot program in Houston and
Philadelphia, provides financial assistance to new businesses that demonstrate
a positive social impact.

Expect the unexpected:  Trends to watch


Hang on.  1996 is going to be bumpy ride.  Start with a late-to-press tax code
and finish with a presidential election.  In between, add management-by-chaos
at the American Institute of CPAs and wild card court decisions on CPA
regulation.  And 1996 is sure to be wild and unpredictable.

But that hasn't deterred Accounting Today's fearless prognosticators.  Here
then are the top trends to watch in 1996:

Inroads by non-CPAs:  Four of the top 10 fastest-growing tax and accounting
firms are hardly your traditional, CPA-owned businesses.  They include
franchises like Jackson Hewitt or conglomerates like American Express.  Even
CPA insiders say the days of CPA-owned monopolies are numbered.

But beyond direct threats, look for new competition from unexpected sources:
Baby Bells are offering start-up business services.  Consumers and small
business are buying new business and accounting software at a blistering pace.
Bankers are end-running accountants with consumer-like matrices for business
loans and on-line record keeping services.

CPE gets a makeover:  Some leaders of the profession are openly questioning
the value and purpose of mandated continuing professional education.  But more
important, computer-based training using multimedia programs, on-line chat
sessions and just-in-time delivery could radically reshape how CPAs choose,
use and pay for CPE.  Some of the products that will point the way are
scheduled for 1996.

Tax system overhaul:  If the flat tax started to loom seriously for the first
time in 1995, then the 1996 presidential election year seems sure to keep it
alive.  No matter who's elected, the next president will have run on a
platform of tax reform.

CPA advertising:  With the American Institute of CPA's $10 million ad
campaign, even tradition-bound, rank-and-file local CPA firms are testing the
media waters for the first time.

AICPA/state society coordination:  Under attack to consolidate services and
cut duplicative costs, AICPA chief executive Barry Melancon is leading a drive
for the profession's trade groups to end hostile rivalries.  Look for advances
in CPE and health insurance.

Value billing:  With clients becoming increasingly cost conscious and
technology reshaping the underlying economics of traditional hourly billing,
tax and accounting practitioners are increasingly turning to alternative
pricing policies, for instance:  Tax prep priced by the form, consulting
engagements priced by the percentage of savings, standard accounting services
priced as part of a bundle of products.  Hot books on the subject:  Last
year's "Innovative Billing and Collection Methods That Work" by Charles and
Joseph Larson, published by Irwin Professional Publishing; this year's
"Breaking the Paradigm" by August Aquila, from the AICPA.

New work place solutions:  In this new era of diminished expectations, a new
generation of professional is striking a fresh balance between career and
personal fulfillment.  Large firms like Ernst & Young are 'hoteling' staffers
- providing home office workspace only when needed.  Midsized firm Clifton
Gunderson is offering partner-level flextime.  Local firms are going virtual -
like CPA Janet Caswell in Bloomfield, Mich., who sent her staffers to work at
home with laptops, e-mail systems and an 800 phone number.

Trade show power shift:  The AICPA and state societies have long held a lock
on the pace-setting conferences in the CPA business.  But declining attendance
revenue and increasing vendor competition are adding a new element of
commercialization to the conference schedule.  As the accounting profession
gets increasingly technology-driven, watch for technology vendors to take more
active and visible roles.  For instance:  This year the AICPA will launch the
Practitioner's Symposium, consolidating three old conferences and making
vendors an integral part.  The National Society of Public Accountants is
considering a technology show.  Microsoft is investigating a number of ways of
establishing its own conference presence.  And Tom Davis, a CPA consultant and
Accounting Today software reviewer, is planning a software show for Amelia
Island, Ga.  The SoftEx show, long aimed at big companies, will be adding a
small-business focus this year.

Consulting takes the driver's seat:  After a year of tremendous double-digit
percentage gains in management advisory services, consulting has clearly
emerged as the driving force at the Big Six.  Ernst & Young could be garnering
half its fees from consulting by 1999.

Financial planning:  With tax work becoming more of a commodity and
marginalized, an increasing number of tax professionals are turning to
personal financial planning.  Membership in the AICPA's financial planning
division has surged with the recognition of the rival certified financial
planner designation.  The number of registered advisers is booming.  And with
a flat tax, planning could be all that's left.

Outsourcing:  Re-engineering and rightsizing are driving staff and
administrative functions into the waiting arms of accountants and business
advisors.  Over the next three years, outsourced assignments could jump from
26 percent of the world's 300 largest corporations to 42 percent, according to
Arthur Andersen, one of the most aggressive information technology providers.
Even the level of controversial internal audit outsourcing could more than
double.

CPA firm diversification:  KPMG Peat Marwick's creation of Baymark, a captive
investment bank, was just the tip of the iceberg as firms grapple for new
sources of income.  Ernst & Young is aiming to become a major player in
hospital administration.

Related trend - Expansion goes vertical:  Firms are acquiring skills and
practices in strategically important niches.  Among smaller firms, for
example, Yergen & Meyer in Portland, Ore., has acquired TGS, a local boutique
firm with Pacific Rim connections.

IRS hunkers down:  With much of the momentum for a flat tax fueled by simple
hatred at the IRS, the agency can be expected to pull in its horns.  Without
the taxpayer compliance measurement project, for example, watch for the IRS to
pick new audit targets using computerized statistical techniques.

Related trend - Go ELF yourself:  By going on-line as much as possible, the
IRS could soon be circumventing established electronic filing services.

Non-financial performance measures:  With the traditional audit in decline,
expect a slew of ideas for providing new assurance services.  KPMG Peat
Marwick is rolling out its Business Measurement Process to augment the audit.
The AICPA has a committee developing more.

Related trend 1 - CPAs create new system of product development:  But even
more important, the profession could be forging a totally new system of
creating CPA-only services.  Instead of writing cookbooks detailing every step
of the new process, standard-setters might only mandate results, leaving the
methodologies to innovators in the CPA marketplace.

Related trend 2 - Plain-paper financial statements:  Whether the AICPA
approves so-called assembly statements or not, clearly many CPAs believe
small-business clients are clamoring for simplified reports.  Watch for CPAs
to find products to compete with low-end or non-CPA competitors.

Windows sets the standard:  Although the accounting market may lag behind the
rest of the world, it is inevitable that Microsoft's Windows will become the
standard software platform.  The expenses of rewriting DOS software could
drive many smaller software vendors out of the business.

Related trend - Intuit, armed with TurboTax, becomes a standard of its own in
electronic commerce.

- Paula Cozzi Goedert, tax attorney with Chicago's Jenner & Block, on the IRS
crackdown on unreported income for nonprofits.



"There's no such thing as an economic reality audit.  They don't exist."

- IRS deputy commissioner Michael Dolan, responding to the National Society of

THE BEST OF FOOTNOTES 1995


BARRY WHO?  - "Barry Melancon, please," said the caller to the American
Institute of CPA's New York office.

"Who?"  asked the receptionist.  "I'm sorry, I don't have that name in the
directory."

"But he's the new president of the AICPA," the caller said.

"Oh, you mean Me-lahn-KON?  He won't really be here until, like, July."

"Ok, thank you.  I guess I'll try him in Louisiana."


TV NEWS SHREDS CPAS BECAUSE CPAS DIDN'T - A bevy of Chicago accountants were
caught red-faced on the 11 o'clock news for failing to shred many confidential
client documents before trashing them.

A local television station news crew from WMAQ unearthed all sorts of
interesting records by going through the dumpsters of major CPA firms and
financial institutions.

Unused checkbooks, bank statements and tax returns were just a few of the
items dug up.


WE WOULDN'T TOUCH THAT WITH A 10-FOOT POLL - San Diego CPAs felt the bite of
American Express Tax & Business Services after sending a survey to members of
the local chapter of the California Society of CPAs.

The survey asked if CPAs thought American Express reps were "snakes in the
grass who have no business being a part of our meetings."  AmEx didn't take
too kindly to being compared to reptiles.  "To be referred to as snakes seems
mean-spirited at best and defamatory at worst," wrote AmEx counsel Sarah
McKenzie to San Diego chapter president Doug Obenshain.  Obenshain apologized,
but that wasn't good enough for McKenzie, who requested he either retract the
comments or publish his letter of apology in the next chapter newsletter.


I JUST WANNA SHOP - All it took was a Hindu monk and a good accountant to
straighten out the Yin and Yang of singer Gino Vanelli's life.

Vanelli became an overnight sensation in 1978 when his hit record "I Just
Wanna Stop" sold a million copies, making him a multimillionaire.

But apparently a million dollars doesn't go as far as it used to, and Vanelli
quickly racked up quite a debt, supporting friends and relatives and buying
new homes.

Vanelli began a spiritual journey, seeking direction from a world of
philosophies.  He spoke with Benedictine monks in Big Sur, Calif., Inca
priests in Peru and Zen priests in Japan, finally meeting a Hindu monk near
Malibu, Calif.

The monk closed his eyes, opened them and gazed far into the sky.  After a
moment of silence he said the words that would bring about Vanelli's financial
salvation:  "What you really need is a good accountant."


LIFE IS LIKE A BOX OF LAWSUITS - Paramount Pictures Corp.  has resolved its
financial differences with "Forrest Gump" author Winston Groom.

The studio had claimed it hasn't cleared any "net profits" for the blockbuster
movie, and gave Groom only $250,000 for his work.  The movie reportedly
grossed $341 million in the United States.

The settlement came soon after Groom retained attorney Pierce O'Donnel, the
same lawyer who represented writer Art Buchwald in a similar dispute against
Paramount regarding the Eddie Murphy movie "Coming to America."

In addition, Paramount agreed to buy the sequel.  This time Groom got an
undisclosed seven-figure sum.


FROM THE HOME OFFICE - Concerned about his viewers' finances, CBS "Late Show"
host David Letterman offered a few signs that you've hired a bad accountant.
Among them were:

* You hear him on the phone saying, "Have I ever let you down, Leona?"  * His
"short form" looks suspiciously like a cocktail napkin.  * He used to be some
kind of financial big shot in Orange County.

Rogue AAA 'Club' demands change


SARASOTA, FLA.  - A small but influential group within the American Accounting
Association has officially challenged the governance of the organization,
claiming unfair representation and poor management.

Informally calling themselves "The Reform Club," the disgruntled college and
university faculty have gained enough support to propose three
near-revolutionary bylaw changes and bring them to a vote before the
membership of less than 10,000.

Although even the reformers doubt they'll win, the battle is rocking an
otherwise staid association of college and university faculty.  It is also
posing a first challenge to new executive director Craig Polhemus.  He took
over from Paul Gerhardt, who retired after two decades of service last summer.

The proposals would open up the executive committee to a broader nominating
process, encourage the proliferation of sections within the organization, and
allow members to receive one of the section journals as part of membership
dues.

Critics of The Reform Club reject the charge that the organization is
undemocratic or that its highest echelons are closed to small-school faculty.
They criticize the club's proposals as vague, with the potential to fragment
the association.

Describing the AAA's executive committee as dominated by 10 or 12 doctoral
degree-granting schools, Paul Williams, a professor at North Carolina State
University, said the panel has ignored member needs.

"Most members are at schools like N.C.  State, and the AAA is not responsive
to the types of problems we encounter," Williams says.  "Our primary job is to
teach and only in the last couple of years have we had a teaching section.


'The Reform Club' agenda

1.  Open ruling executive committee to nominations.  2.  Foster new and
smaller special-interest sections.  3.  Impose market discipline on journal
publishing.

Get real, AICPA tells flat taxers


by Sandy Hock


CORONADO, CALIF.  - As an American Institute of CPAs committee prepares to
release a 225-page report on alternative income tax systems, the committee's
chair challenged those touting reform to get real.

"You're dealing with theoretical rhetoric and missing the realities that we
accountants tend to revel in," said Byrle M.  Abbin, chair of the AICPA's
consumption tax task force.

Economists from all sides "are so far apart that I don't trust either end of
the spectrum," Abbin, a retired partner from Arthur Andersen & Co., told the
420 conferees at the AICPA Fall Tax Division meeting here last month.

Abbin's committee report, scheduled to be released this week, is not intended
to be a policy statement on each reform proposal.  Abbin said, however, that
the AICPA doubts that substituting a flat tax, the most talked about tax
reform proposition, would "appreciably simplify" the system for many
taxpayers.

Since 70 percent of individual filers use the standard deductions, Abbin wrote
in the back-up material provided for the conference, the loss of itemized
deductions does not change their situation.

Further, whether standard or itemized deductions are used, any individual with
taxable income of less than $100,000 can get his or her tax liability from
Form 1040 instructions.

"For them, the effect is the same as having one flat rate, at least with
regard to the complexity of calculating the tax," Abbin wrote.

And the flat tax was just one of the areas touched on when Abbin moderated an
alternative tax panel discussion that featured a member of former Republican
Congressman Jack Kemp's Tax Reform Commission and a Democrat offering the
party's response to the commission's work.

Speaking for the Kemp commission, Loretta H.  Adams, a San Diego business
owner, said the current level of tax complexity "is more than just a hassle
and drag on the economy."  In fact, Adams said U.S.  companies spent $127
billion and individuals spent another $65 billion complying with tax laws.
Losing that $192 billion to tax compliance and preparation is the equivalent
of "taking General Motors' output and dumping it in the ocean."

After attending public hearings in eight cities and hearing from 125
witnesses, the Kemp panel came away with one message:  The current tax system
should be replaced.  The commission drew up six principles tax reform should
promote:  simplicity, stability, neutrality, visibility, economic growth and
fairness; taxes shouldn't be hidden.

While Adams said the Kemp committee will release its report early this year,
John Buckley, the minority chief tax counsel for the House Ways and Means
Committee, is already speculating that the commission will back a flat tax.

"It may be the flat tax as proposed by [Rep.  Dick] Armey would be what is
recommended," Buckley said.  "If it is, I think I can say the Democrats will
oppose it."

In short, Armey, a Texas Republican, calls for a flat tax rate of from 17 to
20 percent.  It's known as the proposal that will allow taxpayers to file
their returns on a postcard.

Buckley argued that calling the Armey plan a flat tax is "misleading."  For
individuals, the flat income tax would be levied on wages and retirement
distributions.  Dividends, on the other hand, would be exempt.

"There would be a substantial shift of tax burden down the income scale,"
Buckley maintained.

A flat tax would repeal the earned income tax credit, which would contribute
to increasing taxes on the lowest 20 percent of working Americans, he added.

Self-employed individuals would not be entitled to a standard deduction so
they would be paying the 17 to 20 percent rate "from dollar one," Buckley
said.  And since the Armey plan would allow employers to deduct wages, but not
employees' fringe benefits, it would give companies an incentive to drop
health insurance in favor of salary increases.

In addressing the other tax proposals bandied about, such as the national
retail sales tax plan endorsed by Sen.  Richard G.  Lugar, R-Ind., Buckley was
equally lukewarm.

"Retail taxes are a small part of the economy," he said.  And only three
states have tried to tax services, which is a large segment of the economy, he
added.

Abbin gave a thumbnail sketch of each of the major tax proposals.  He
explained that the plan furthest along in the thought process is the unlimited
savings allowance proposed by Sens.  Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and Pete Domenici,
R-N.M.  That bipartisan plan favors savings and taxes consumption.  Armey's
proposal is a five-page bill that extracts certain segments of the Internal
Revenue Code, Abbin said.

"It leaves a lot of questions," he added.

And all that is concrete about the plans of Rep.  Bill Archer, R-Texas, to
dismantle the Internal Revenue Service and overhaul the tax system are
interviews with the press.

But he did offer some opinions about the proposals.  Here are a few snippets:

National retail sales tax:  "They'd have to control cascading [taxes on top of
taxes].  ...  [The plan's backers] want a killing off of the IRS.  I call them
the tax militia.  They think Republicans who favor the flat tax or
Nunn/Domenici are ultra-liberal."

Flat tax:  "The key element is for international trade.  Everything made in
the United States is taxed, even if it is exported.  If there's no taxation on
operations outside the United States the whole nature of international tax
planning goes out the window."

USA plan:  "Exports will have border relief, but exports will be taxed."

Value-added tax:  "A credit invoice system will never happen here.
Politicians don't like that obvious nature."  In other words, taxpayers would
see how much their government costs them.

Geo.  S.  Olive acquires local health care consulting firm


INDIANAPOLIS - In a move that doubles its fees in the health care niche and
establishes a consulting arm, regional firm Geo.  S.  Olive & Co.  has
acquired local boutique Kimmerling, Myers & Co.

Now the largest health care practice in the state, GSO is poised for even
further expansion in the niche, managing partner John Harris said.

"Our effort is to become part of the health care industry, not just to serve
it," Harris said, adding that the firm will become more involved with trade
associations and seminars, and will even develop some products - such as
benchmarking statistics - useful to the industry.  "Our goal is to become the
largest health care consulting firm in the Midwest."

GSO's $2 million health care practice had consisted mainly of compliance work,
while the $2 million Kimmerling, Myers is virtually all consulting.  GSO,
which ended fiscal year May 1995 at $43 million, expects to jump to $50
million by May 1996, Harris said.

"They were servicing clients we didn't have access to," Harris said.  "We
didn't have the consulting experience."

"GSO had physician clients, while Kimmerling, Myers served facility clients,"
said Jeff Kimmerling, managing partner of Kimmerling, Myers.  "It made sense
to put our work together.  We expect to double the health care practice in two
years."

GSO's health care practice will operate out of Kimmerling, Myer's Indianapolis
office under the name Olive Health Care Consulting.  The division will be
headed by Kimmerling, who joins GSO as a partner along with James Myers,
Michael Merkel and Michael Craig.  KM's 20 staff members also joins GSO.

With 10 offices throughout Indiana and Illinois, GSO now has 70 partners and
more than 600 staff.  The few people comprising GSO's existing health care
practice will move into the Olive Health Care Consulting office, Harris said.
Ten new hires have been made to supplement that office, Harris added.


PRACTICE MANAGEMENT:  AICPA woos college students with interactive CD-ROM

NEW YORK - It may not stir quite as much interest as a keg party, but the
American Institute of CPAs has created a funky-yet-informative CD-ROM aimed at
encouraging college students to become CPAs.

The second phase of the AICPA's two-level campaign to encourage new recruits
to the profession, "Room Zoom:  The CPA SourceDisc," offers students a variety
of windows into a CPA's world.  The interactive CD contains about 20 minutes
of video, audio and still photos, plus a large body of text and plenty of
graphics.

"We needed the proper medium," said John Daidone, AICPA manager of recruiting
programs.  "CD-ROM offers the best approach to illustrate the CPA profession
as being technically proficient."

The AICPA has produced 5,000 CDs which will be sent to the state societies,
the recruiting contacts at larger firms and several colleges and universities
across the nation, Daidone said.  The state societies are encouraged to
distribute the CDs directly to local colleges as well.  Additional copies of
the CD will cost $5 each, with discounts if more than 10 are ordered.  The
AICPA spent $300,000 on the production and distribution of the CDs and the
accompanying posters.

The CD opens with a young resident of a home office welcoming her "guest."
The user is told to make herself at home while the host runs out for a minute.
As the user moves the mouse across the screen, different cartoon-like bubbles
appear, displaying one of the gateways that provide more information.  For
instance, when moving the mouse to the bookshelf, the user is offered the
option of investigating library resources.  Choose the safe and learn about
salaries; a calendar leads to "a day in the life."  Other gateways include
"career opportunities," "ladder of success," "human resources," "tools of the
trade" and "organizations."

The career opportunities gateway features CPAs in various segments of the
profession offering insights on their career successes.  Human resources sheds
light on key issues such as balancing personal and professional life and
career opportunities for women and minorities.  The library features
information on the Uniform CPA Examination and a directory of more than 800
institutions across the United States that offer accounting programs.

The AICPA stepped up its recruiting efforts after a 1990 poll found students
unimpressed with the role of accountants.  "That's why we made this effort,"
Daidone said.  "In general we found that a lot of negative stereotypes about
accountants came out in the survey.  They thought accountants were boring
number crunchers who worked alone."

The first phase of the recruitment effort was aimed at high school and early
college students.  A video produced in 1993 introduced viewers to the
accounting profession.

"The first phase of the program, 'Accounting:  One degree with 360 degrees of
possibilities,' was designed to attract students to the study of accounting,"
Daidone said.  "In this second phase we're taking it up one more level and
trying to attract students to become CPAs."

IRS tells how workers can declare 'independence'


by Ken Rankin


WASHINGTON - Responding to criticism that some Internal Revenue Service
regions are conducting a witch hunt against businesses that classify workers
as independent contractors, top tax service officials are preparing new
instructions to discourage such heavy handed enforcement tactics.

According to IRS Commissioner Margaret Milner Richardson, new training
materials under development for IRS examiners will "emphasize the principle
that using independent contractors can be a legitimate business practice that
will not be challenged by the service."

A new headquarters policy embodied in the training materials will require
faster resolution of worker classification disputes and uniform standards for
defining independent contractors throughout the country.

Testifying before Congress late last year, Richardson said she hoped to have
the new worker classification materials finalized in time to permit retraining
of all IRS examiners by the end of this month.

The new training aids are the latest in a series of moves by the IRS to defuse
mounting criticism from accountants and small businesses that the agency's
crackdown on the use of independent contractors is improper and abusive.

Adding to the concerns are the stiff penalties for businesses charged with
violating the current standards.

Employers accused of incorrectly classifying W-2 workers as independent
contractors can be required to pay 100 percent of both the employer's and the
employee's share of Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes, plus all of
the federal income taxes that would have been withheld had the contractor been
classified as a salaried employee.

If the IRS declares the classification error to be intentional - a finding the
agency is not required to prove - the business can be hit with an additional
100 percent penalty, plus interest for previous years.

Delegates to this summer's White House Conference on Small Business identified
reform of IRS independent contractor ground rules as their No.  1 priority,
and during subsequent House hearings on the problem, CPAs from across the
country called for legislation to set simpler rules governing worker
classification.

Shaken by the backlash against the agency's current enforcement strategy, IRS
officials placed much of the blame on overzealous field examiners.

To ensure uniform treatment of all businesses under investigation for
independent contractor violations, the IRS adopted new procedures requiring
regional and local personnel to secure approval from the national office in
Washington before undertaking any large worker classification projects.

The program will be based on the following series of principles which
Richardson said would govern future IRS policy in worker classification cases:

* Worker classification issues should be resolved as quickly and as early in
the administrative process as possible.  * Worker classification issues should
be resolved uniformly throughout the country.  * Resolution of worker
classification issues should take into account a taxpayer's past compliance
with section 530, as well as the common law standard (governing worker
classification).  * The IRS compliance programs should encourage correct
classification and correct reporting of payments to workers.  *
Reclassification of workers who have legitimately been treated as independent
contractors must be avoided.

Audit & Accounting:  Change Of Auditors


US 1 SHIFTS FROM DELOITTE TO COOPERS:  Deloitte & Touche was dismissed as
independent accountant for US 1 Industries after helping the client correct a
series of internal control problems ranging from unrecorded transactions to
inadequate computerized accounting systems.

Over a year ago, Deloitte informed officials at the Gary, Ind.  company that
US 1's management was "unable to close the accounting records and produce
reliable financial statements within the time frames required for public
companies."

"Significant transactions had occurred that had not been recorded on the books
and records of the company, including sales of property, repossession of
equipment, and contingencies related to broken lease commitments and other
contractual agreements," the client told the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

In addition, "supporting documentation for a significant number of sales, cost
of sales, cash receipts and other general ledger journal entries could not be
located."

Although accountants at Deloitte concluded that the company had adequately
addressed each of these issues, US 1 elected to replace that firm with Coopers
& Lybrand.

CANADIAN ACCOUNTANTS SOUR ON WINCANTON FOLLOWING QUESTIONABLE DEALS:  Canadian
accountants at KPMG Peat Marwick Thorne resigned as auditor for Reno,
Nev.-based Wincanton Corp.  after informing the client that they were
"unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by
management."

KPMG's concerns were stirred by a series of recent transactions, including the
sale of stock in the company's Tradesman Industries subsidiary to Work
Recovery Inc.  for shares of that corporation valued at some $2.5 million.

The accountants also raised questions about a $9.6 million consulting fee paid
to Work Recovery in connection with the sale of cargo bed and tailgate systems
technology to that company.

In disassociating themselves from the client's financial statements, the
Vancouver-based accountants said they couldn't obtain sufficient appropriate
audit evidence on the propriety of these transactions.

PRACTICE MANAGEMENT FORUM:  Looking ahead to the year 2001:  A sales odyssey

WANTED SALES MANAGER FOR BIG 4 FIRM

Local office of Big Four firm seeks experienced sales manager for midsized
office.  Must have CPA and at least three years sales management experience at
a large CPA firm.  Responsibilities will include oversight and development of
experienced staff of three client-relators as well as penetration of
non-client accounts.  Send resume to Box 1234.

This ad was spotted in the Feb.  9, 2001, edition of The Wall Street Journal.

Surprised?  You shouldn't be.  Impossible?  Don't bet on it.  Unlikely
prediction?  Hardly.  Some local offices of Big Six and regional firms are
already employing salespeople.

Our profession has never been more competitive, and the new millennium will
have a great deal of change in store for accountants.

Here are some more predictions:

* Non-CPA firms will continue to encroach upon our "turf."

Did you know that four of the 10 fastest growing accounting firms in the
United States are not CPA firms?  Most people don't - including your partners.

American Express just won its federal suit against the state of Florida,
permitting non-CPA firms to employ CPAs.

As other states look to this case, reviews and audits may fall to non-CPAs.
After all, why shouldn't non-CPAs perform these same services?  If they pass
the peer review process, wouldn't this open up a monopoly to more competition,
and wouldn't the consumer ultimately benefit from lower costs?  Accounting
could be next in the line of industries the government has already
deregulated, like telephone companies and airlines.

I hope it happens.  Just as we are driving much better cars today than 20
years ago because of the competition from the Japanese, clients will receive a
much higher level of service when CPAs compete in a marketplace against real
business people, not just other accountants.

* Big companies will increase efforts to attract the best clients of their
smaller rivals.

Competition will increase not only from below - non-CPAs - but also from
above.  Many big firms have stagnant revenues and will increase their emphasis
on obtaining regional and local firms' "A" clients.  This trend has developed
steadily in some markets for the last five years, and will continue to grow.

* Competition will increase as CPAs leave stagnant firms to take more control
over their careers.

Sharp managers and young partners realize they are often held back by partners
who won't let go of the management reins and allow the firm to prosper and
change.

These rainmakers are already leaving firms in droves, taking some of their
clients.  This trend will continue as these hotshots realize many of them are
buying into firms that have been drained of assets by greedy partners facing
retirement, with no desire to invest in technology, training or client
relationships.

These changes will affect our profession in numerous ways by the turn of the
century.  For instance:

* A formalized sales management function will control the development of
business.

Firms will hire salespeople.  CPAs will be highly valued, and recruited
specifically for sales.  Some will drop out of the technical side as they see
the road to partnership open only to those who bring in business.  Many firms
will see hiring salespeople as a panacea for stalled growth, since their
partners don't want to be involved in the selling process.

* The technical aspect of our profession will be relegated to the "back room."

As our profession becomes more competitive, business development, rather than
the quality of technical work, will be recognized as the life blood of the
professional firm.

Firms will focus on garnering new business.  Firms that don't shift emphasis
will merge or perish.

* Dramatic decreases in fee structures will hit the profession across all
service lines.

As the increased emphasis on marketing prompts clients to become more aware of
alternatives, fee competition will escalate.  Fees will be cut in all areas of
service, not just in audit and accounting.

* Only people with existing books of business will be promoted to full
partnership.

Technicians will no longer be able to share in the fruits of full partnership
as firms finally realize that it is far easier to acquire technical ability
than entrepreneurial talent.  Just as industrial companies raid competitors
for successful salespeople, CPA firms will vie for rainmakers.

* The profession's image of trust and respectability will be tarnished as
clients equate CPAs with other sales-types that they deal with.

CPA salespeople will fall into the same grab bag for dollars as other
salespeople.  Clients will view them with the same disdain as printing and
insurance salespeople.

* CPA firms will use consulting as the main inroad to new clients.

Even small accounting firms will offer free consulting work just to get their
foot in the door.

* The most successful firms will not employ salespeople, but will have
developed a solid core of practicing entrepreneurs.

Some firms will have decided early on to succeed in a much more competitive
environment without resorting to a separate force of salespeople.  Realizing
that marketing and selling is just as important as technical skill, these
firms will have invested in growing the business development skills of their
most likely producers.  Their reputation as trusted business advisors will
remain intact.

So where do marketing people fit in?

Marketing directors still play a powerful role, whether establishing a
formalized sales function or creating an internal culture of entrepreneurship.

In either case, somebody still has to manage the marketing aspects, enhance
the sales process and help bring in the actual opportunities to sell.  Merely
hiring salespeople will not work without a comprehensive, integrated marketing
plan so that all are pursuing the optimal targeted clients and markets.

In some cases, the marketing director will also assume the role of sales
manager, as many firms will be too small or too cheap to hire someone separate
to manage that function.

In firms that decide to shun the salesperson route by becoming
entrepreneurial, marketing directors will have to take on the role of internal
sales manager.

What can you do now?

CPAs who turn their backs on this undeniable trend towards increased
competition will watch their firms disintegrate.

There are, however, certain preemptive tactics your firm can employ to avoid
the oncoming onslaught:

* Establish a beachhead in the marketplace that is difficult to penetrate.

Chrysler is a great example of what can happen in a changing marketplace.  For
years, Chrysler and their Detroit rivals ignored the increased competition
from the Japanese.  Fat and sassy, they believed people would continue to buy
cars the way they always had.  Caught off-guard by a dramatically changed
marketplace that demanded small, well-made, fuel-efficient cars, they lost a
significant piece of market share that they've never made up.  Chrysler almost
went out of business.

In order to survive, Chrysler had to get smart.  In the early '80s, they
introduced a new vehicle - the minivan - and created a new marketplace.  As
their competitors jumped on the bandwagon, they pressed forward, leading the
way in design and features.  By the time their competitors had established a
position in the market, Chrysler was so entrenched that they still sell more
minivans than ever.

* Make sure your firm has a strategic marketing plan.

Amazingly, even many of those firms with marketing directors have no strategic
marketing plan that delineates where and how they are going to go to market
for the next three to five years.  If you don't know where your business is
going to come from, how can you get it?

* Get your people trained to sell and market.

Personal marketing and selling skills do not come naturally to the vast
majority of CPAs, but many firms expect CPAs to somehow learn these skills by
accident.  Identifying clients and prospects' needs and wants and persuading
people to do business with you are far greater skills than being an auditor or
a tax person.

* Concentrate on client service.

It's time the accounting profession learned to service the clients in the way
they want to be served.  Since this subject still isn't taught in accounting
school, it's up to you to drive the message home internally.  If you don't get
your people up to par in delivering exemplary service, remember that someone
else will.

Establish monthly client service meetings, where the only subject discussed is
how to better serve your clients, helping them be more successful.

* Help your people establish and pursue niches.

Our profession is the last to realize the importance of marketing
specifically, not generically.  It is obvious to the real business person
(i.e., your clients) that there is more value in dealing with someone who is
an expert in their field.

* Help your people set goals for practice development.

Everybody must have their own goal for new business, otherwise how can they
tell if they've been successful?

* Change the compensation and review process.

What's in it for your non-partners?  Practice development must be rewarded
financially and psychologically, or it won't happen.

Only the most successful CPAs embrace change - the great majority have their
noses to their computers, happy to leave things as they are.  It's up to you
to educate your partners on all that is happening in the marketplace.  And
you'll need to keep telling them until they finally get the message.  Stir
things up now and take control of your firm's destiny.  If you don't, your
competition will do it for you.

SOFTWARE REVIEW:  Budgetary moves add steam to fund accounting


The current balanced budget debate in Washington signals that many services
currently provided by the federal government may soon pass to the states and
the private sector.

This trend will translate into new opportunities for accounting firms, because
the not-for-profit sector will expand rapidly, as states look to
not-for-profits to administer displaced programs.  And new nonprofit
organizations will develop to handle programs no longer conducted by the
government.

Not-for-profits will look to CPAs for the management accounting services
required to implement new control systems and to measure operating results.
To take advantage of these opportunities, accounting firms must become
familiar with the software tools that are available for this complex area.

Fund accounting is not an easy area in which to work.  Issues and concepts in
not-for-profit accounting differ from those found in the profit sector.
Accountability with specific program and grant provisions is critical and
requires extensive departmentalization of information.  Multiple accounting
periods must be considered, as information will be reported not only by fiscal
year, but by program or grant period.

Necessary reports include traditional reports needed by management, as well as
those required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, grant providers
and other regulatory bodies.

This article evaluates five not-for-profit software systems from Executive
Data Systems, Blackbaud, American FundWare, Micro Information Products and
Kenrick Technologies.  The last year has seen fund accounting software vendors
accelerate their move into Windows.  All the vendors in this review have a
Windows program on the market or will offer one during this year.

The move to Windows has been slow and for good reason.  Many nonprofit
organizations have older equipment and tight budgets which preclude rapid
upgrades to new technology.

But moving to Windows should provide clients with smoother links to other
applications, if for no other reason than vendors most often rewrite their
packages in Microsoft or other standard languages.

For example, MIPS Fund Accounting for Windows utilizes C++, Microsoft's Visual
Basic programming languages and the Microsoft Access database engine.  This
move to Microsoft standards has been seen in general accounting packages and
is accelerating in all desktop applications.

Critical issues to be considered when selecting fund accounting software
include account structure handling, report presentation capabilities,
ease-of-use and non-accounting features such as fund-raising support and
mailing list capabilities.

Flexibility in account number format is important to meet the needs of many
different clients.  Account numbering schemes generally determine the
departmentalization of information.  The more flexible the format, the less
need for changing a client's existing account numbering system.  Also, more
flexibility means easier filtering of data for reporting purposes.

Also important is that all fund accounting packages should meet the
requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statements of
Financial Standards 116 and 117.  All the packages reviewed here are compliant
with these standards.

There is more to an accounting system than just accounting information.  In
the profit sector, modules such as accounts receivable, accounts payable and
payroll provide capabilities that may be more critical than the general
ledger.  For a not-for-profit business, you must add modules for fund-raising
and grant information requirement compliance.

Fund accounting concepts and accounting systems are not just complex to the
accountant/consultant.  The staff of a not-for-profit organization may also
find them difficult.

Therefore, ease-of-use should be a primary criterion in the selection process
and should encompass the system's look and feel, data entry conventions,
documentation, on-screen help capabilities and vendor support.

Special system features that will make the accountant's/ consultant's job
easier and more profitable should also be considered.  Reporting features that
prepare financial statements and workpapers in formats that can be used as
part of the compilation, review, or audit process can greatly reduce the time
spent on these engagements.

Also, if the fund accounting vendor offers special programs for the
accountant/consultant for support or reduced pricing, these engagements will
be more profitable.

It is in reselling or consulting that CPAs will make the real money on such
software.

Except for Blackbaud, which uses only direct sales, all the vendors reviewed
here offer reseller programs.  Generally, these programs offer product
discounts and special incentives on promotions and technical support.  Kenrick
offers both reseller and consulting programs, the latter for non-selling
firms, although other vendors also support consultants.

Fund AccountingSoftware Series, Executive Data Systems

Fund Accounting Software Series from Executive Data Systems is a DOS-based
system with a Windows interface for module and process selection.

This approach allows the FASS to be used in organizations with both DOS and
Windows workstations.  The latest 5.5 release of FASS introduces two Windows
components, FASS Access and the Export module, which facilitate data transfer.

FASS Access offers the export of information to Access.  In Access, you can
then perform advanced data queries and prepare on-screen and printed reports.
Access data is easily used with other Windows applications such as
spreadsheets, word processors and report writers.

The Export module also exports information in 20 file formats such as Lotus,
Quattro Pro and Paradox.  This module also includes an Excel compatible
spreadsheet and graphics package.  It features extensive preformatted
financial statement reporting capabilities.  FASS financial statements can be
consolidated by "wild-card" selection or by using user-defined fund groups.

The Multi Fiscal Year Project Reporting module allows the preparation of
financial statements for any range of dates, including multiple fiscal years.
The Custom Report Generator can access FASS accounting and donor information
based on user defined criteria to prepare management reports and graphs, and
to export to other applications.

The FASS Donor Records module maintains an extensive database of the
organization's members, donors, alumni and volunteers for reporting and
mailing purposes.  This module integrates with General Ledger and will track
pledges, dues payments, donations and matching gift data.  More than 30
user-definable data fields can customize the information captured for each
donor.

Transaction detail can be maintained as long as desired.  The system supports
multiple, overlapping fiscal years for grant and project reporting.  Grant and
project reporting is independent of the organization's fiscal year.

Data entry is accelerated through the use of "code tables" for automatic
transaction descriptions, and the user can define transaction entry modes to
save keystrokes.

Executive Data Systems features toll-free support and offers a service to set
up the client's chart of accounts and financial statements.  The cost of this
service varies with the amount of data involved.

Blackbaud Accountingfor Non Profits, Blackbaud

Blackbaud's current offerings include the DOS-based application, Blackbaud Not
For Profit Accounting, Windows versions of its Raiser's Edge fund-raising
system and its Paragon planned giving software.

The company plans to release Windows versions of business applications
beginning in April.  Current purchasers with software maintenance agreements
will receive a Windows upgrade at no charge.

Blackbaud features a table-driven chart of accounts that breaks down each
account by fund, account number, account type, department/cost center,
category and object of expenditure.  A visual chart-of-account organizer that
allows you to see and rearrange the chart of accounts makes setting up and
editing accounts a simple task.

Accounts for new funds can easily be created by copying sample charts of
accounts for similar funds.  General ledger information can be maintained for
two years.  The current year need not be closed to work on subsequent year's
information.  The year-end close can be delayed for up to twelve months while
awaiting final audit adjustments.

The Raiser's Edge supports the organization's gifting development program.
Paragon provides the planned giving professional a tool for easily calculating
and graphing the outcome of planned gifts.  Both products are available in
Windows versions.  The Raiser's Edge also comes in a DOS version.

Windows capabilities are often only marginally advantageous in data entry.
However, The Raiser's Edge and Paragon demonstrate the advantages of the
graphical interface over a text-based application in the area of data review
and editing.  Reviewing and updating information is very easy and intuitive.
Entry of new information is enhanced with pull-down menus and keystroke
shortcuts.

The system has extensive on- screen reporting capabilities featuring very
readable reports.  The system features very flexible report-writing tools.
Reports can be segmented to provide information about projects and grants and
can be either date- or period-driven to support varying reporting periods.
Workpapers can be prepared from system information by saving report
information in a spreadsheet format.

FundWare on Windows, American Fundware

American Fundware offers an extensive suite of applications to meet the
accounting needs of not-for-profit organizations.  Fundware offers 17 modules
on multiple platforms and three Windows specific modules.

Fundware runs on a variety of operating systems including DOS, Windows, Unix
and AIX.  The system can consolidate not-for-profit transactions as well as
any for-profit enterprises the entity may operate.

American Fundware has just released FundWare on Windows, which has the ability
to run multiple sessions simultaneously through the FundWare on Windows
Session Manager.

A File Viewer makes it easier to access the Windows Print Manager utility,
improving printer selection and making it possible to preview reports prior to
printing.

Monarch for FundWare is a version of the Datawatch Monarch Windows data access
and analysis tool specifically designed to run with FundWare.  With Monarch
for FundWare, you can use spooled report file information to view, query,
analyze and export information.

Essentially, Monarch is a report generator in reverse.  Report information is
converted into Monarch data, which can then be "mined" to meet specific
reporting needs using spreadsheets and report generators.

The FundWare Corridor improves FundWare's data connectivity with other
applications by providing open access to the FundWare database.  Information
is presented in Microsoft's Open Database Connectivity standard.  ODBC
compliance allows the data to be accessed by other ODBC-compliant applications
such as Excel, 1-2-3, Access and Crystal Reports.

FundWare allows you to design your own account structure of up to 18 digits,
or you can use a predefined chart of accounts.  Two aliases can be assigned to
each account to easily look up accounts that have different descriptions in
different funds, accounts, grants or projects.  General ledger information can
be retained for an unlimited amount of time.  The system provides up to four
adjustment accounting periods for segregating year-end and audit adjustments
from the normal posting periods.

The Allocation Management System automates transaction allocation and can be
used to extract information for reallocations.  American Fundware does not
have a fund-raising module, but it links to donor packages from PledgeMaker,
Donor Perfect and others.

It also features an allocation management module for handling
multi-fund/department allocation of transactions.  This feature is used to
automatically allocate recurring transactions among multiple accounts, funds
or projects.

The Budget Forecasting module extracts historical information into a separate
database for creating and revising the entity's budget.  This module will
track up to 60 budget revisions and allows the updating of historical
information without changing budget data.

A separate Budget Control module monitors budget compliance and warns when an
account approaches or exceeds its budget.  Report capabilities include macros
to group reports for batch printing.  Masks are employed to filter report
information by fund, grant and project.

The Extended Report Writer prepares reports from any journal and any period
maintained in the system.  This module also maintains an extended database of
information such as population, grant dates and number of clients served.  The
information can be used in combination with other financial data to produce
reports.

MIP NonProfit Seriesfor Windows, Micro Information Products Inc.

MIP's NonProfit Series for Windows, introduced in November, is designed using
non-proprietary tools:  C++, Microsoft's Visual Basic programming language and
the Access database engine.  MIP also released MIP Fund Accounting for DOS,
Version 9.0 at the same time.

The Windows release began with the General Ledger module and will be followed
by Accounts Payable, Budgeting and Payroll modules in the first six months of
this year.  Other modules will continue to be released this year, including
Fund Raising.

MIP offers many ease-of-use features such as Wizards for information setup,
customizable tool bars, and Windows-compliant screens, menus and help.  MIP
also features extensive security capabilities that define security for each
user, module and organization.  Security also can be defined for any menu
level.

The system supports complete GASB and FASB reporting and reports can cover any
time period.  The software features many standard reports that are the
building blocks for customized reports.  Reports are customized by the rows
and columns of information that the user wants included in the report.

The system's design allows the use of data with other applications such as
database tools, spreadsheets and word processors.  For example, it supports
direct query, with proper security, from within Microsoft Excel or Word.

MIP allows an unlimited number of user-definable general ledger account
segments which can be up to 255 characters in length each.  Field size and
data formatting within fields can be user-defined.  An Account Setup Wizard
makes it easy to set up new information and to model new accounts from
existing information.

MIP Fund Accounting does not have its own fund-raising module, but supports
links to Donor Perfect, Donor$ and Softrek fund-raising packages.  Transaction
information can be exported to other applications in ASCII, Delimited ASCII,
 .WKS and DBF formats.

The system features strong context-sensitive help tools.  The complete user
manual can be viewed on screen.  With maintenance, all upgrades are free.

The company guarantees a new release of each product every 18 months.  MIP
guarantees a two-hour response time for customer support calls.

Kenrick Fund Accounting for Windows, Kenrick Technologies

Kenrick Technologies was scheduled to ship Version 2 of its Fund Accounting
for Windows this month.  A true Windows application, the new product expands
upon the company's DOS version 4.1's use of C language source code, thus
benefitting from the original source code's maturity.

Release 2.0 features several new ease-of-use features.  Journal Genies are
used to integrate journal information from a variety of data sources into the
general journal.  Using Genies, information in spreadsheet-prepared workpapers
can be the source of journal transactions.

Another new feature, Two-Way Spreadsheet Journal Entries, allows the software
to furnish information for spreadsheet workpapers.  Kenrick uses Dynamic Data
Exchange linking to exchange information with other Windows applications.

The chart of account structure is divided into components for account code,
department and fund.  There are as many as 17 segments and virtually unlimited
sub-accounts within the account number structure.  The number of digits of the
components of the account number structure can be varied to meet the needs of
each nonprofit entity.  The minimum length is five characters; the maximum,
20.

When new funds or departments are added to the system, the accounts for the
new addition can be mirrored from the existing chart.  Transaction information
can be maintained indefinitely.  Kenrick's approach to grant accounting makes
grant (or project) identifiers a component of the general ledger account
structure.

Grants and projects can also be handled separately from the chart of accounts
by entering grant and project code information at the transaction level.  This
simplifies the setup of short-term projects and grants and allows more
comprehensive reporting on grants and projects.

Reports can be prepared for any accounting period, regardless of the entity's
fiscal accounting period.  The KenQuery feature offers fast searches of system
database information for sorting and printing data.  Custom reporting
capabilities are provided via a dBase style report writer.

One unique feature is Kenrick's 990 tax return support.  The system will
transfer revenue and expense information directly into the Arthur Andersen
A-Plus Tax 990/990PF program.

Kenrick offers very flexible budgeting features.  The Projects and Grants
module allows for unlimited project/grant lives and multiple budgets for any
part of the organization.  This information can be grouped for any date range
at any time.  The system maintains budget data for the last budget period, the
current period and the next period approved budget.

The system offers extensive on-screen help capabilities.  All information
found in the paper manuals is in on-screen help.  The company also offers data
conversion, training and related network support.

Summary

CPAs and consultants are in for a bonanza with not-for-profit organizations.
As more services move from the federal government to the states and private
organizations, the need for tax, financial reporting and consulting services
will rapidly expand.  The addition of Windows versions by many fund accounting
software vendors will also increase the opportunities for CPAs.

DOS users will be interested in moving to the more powerful Windows
applications.  This will offer the opportunity to provide new and profitable
services.

Also, the new Windows applications offer expanded connectivity features.
Consultants will be able to provide on-going services for developing reports
and information systems that link fund accounting software information to
other applications.

TODAY'S NEWS

WASHINGTON:
   NATIONSBANK asked a federal judge to deny class-action status for
a pending fair-lending lawsuit. Page 2
   REGIONAL BANKING:
   SKEPTICS are having a field day with the prediction of a TV
commentator that Glendale Federal will be sold this year. Dan Dorfman said
Glenfed's chairman was rumored to be pushing hard for a deal worth $1.2
billion or more. Page 6
   LOS ANGELES "strongly opposes" Wells' bid for First Interstate, the
mayor and city council president told the Fed in a letter. Page 6
   MORTGAGES:
   HOUSE BANKING Chairman Jim Leach has asked the chairmen of Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac to persuade loan servicers to cut some slack for
furloughed government workers who miss mortgage payments. Page 13
   AS MORTGAGE BANKERS prepare for a new refinancing wave, they are
struggling to digest the enduring effect of the last one - a strict new
emphasis on the bottom line. The signs were everywhere last year.
   Pages 12, 13
   CREDIT UNIONS:
   1995 WAS A BANNER YEAR for credit unions, as capital levels hit
historic highs and delinquency continued a decade-long decline. Too bad
nobody noticed. Instead, the industry made an embarrassing spectacle of
itself. Page 7
   COLORADO BANKERS are going to the courts to block a credit union
expansion. Page 7
   COMMUNITY BANKING:
   FARM LENDERS had a fairly good 1995, but not everywhere or with every
product. Problems in such sectors as the cattle industry could continue,
and Congress is likely to reduce subsidies. Page 10
   THE MASSACHUSETTS Independent Bankers Association is waking up
from a long hibernation, abandoning old lobbying efforts in favor of
helping members boost profits through cooperative efforts.
   Page 10
   INVESTMENT PRODUCTS:
   NATIONAL BANKS with trust departments operating in several states
may soon get a break on the cost of doing business. Page 14
   AFTER THREE MONTHS of fine-tuning, the National Association of
Securities Dealers has issued its final proposal to create a new framework
for bank-affiliated broker-dealers. The proposal now goes to the SEC.
   Page 15
   CREDIT/DEBIT/ATMs:
   VISA has introduced a guaranteed car-rental reservation service
for peak travel times. The goal is to discourage consumers from booking
with multiple renters and then becoming no-shows. Page 17
   FIRST DATA's remittance processing business is being acquired by a
National City subsidiary.

WEEKLY ADVISER: THE TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS OF THE FAMILY-RUN BANK

By Paul Nadlers
The family-owned and family-run bank seems like the ultimate in
community banking.
   "I bank at Smith Bank" or "I've been banking with the Jones family all
my life, and so did my father" are typical comments in many communities
where a grandfather or even great-grandfather started a bank and son after
son took up the mantle.
   But all is not sweetness and light in the family bank tradition, even
though it has great deal to offer.
   One problem is that people in town expect the banker to always say yes.
"Your father served my father," is the line. "How can you turn me down
now?"
   I remember talking to a small group in one town where the banker was
bragging about his family tradition. One customer piped up that he too had
a family banking tradition. "I am a third-generation check kiter."
   A more serious question for a family bank, though, is whether the new
generation wants to work at it.
   When I was an undergraduate, a speaker at college told us: "Half of you
in this room are Republicans because your fathers are Republicans. And half
of you are Democrats because your fathers are Republicans."
   Among my proudest achievement as a teacher has been talking students out
of being accountants or lawyers or bankers just because their fathers were.
   "It's awful," parents tell me. "My son became a chef (or whatever)
instead of going into banking."
   "Is he happy?" I ask.
   "Absolutely."
   "Then why are you moaning?" I say. "You should be cheering."
   When it is a family business, however, taking a different path is harder
to do - even if your heart isn't in becoming a bank president.
   And following in your father's footsteps is also not easy. I know.
   My father was one of the most famous bank economists of his day. Every
time I did something right, people would say, "What do you expect from
Marcus Nadler's son, with all the help he has received." And when things
went wrong, the comment would be, "Wow, you let your father down."
   Maybe it's the problem of following your dad that has made so many
second- and third-generation bankers take chances to show their
independence - chances that in a number of cases have seriously damaged
their banks, or killed them.
   But what if you basically inherit a bank presidency and really want the
job? How do you learn to do it well?
   There are three basic training grounds, and each has its drawbacks:
   Your own bank. Being trained there limits the opportunities for growth.
   All too often a young heir apparent is trained by putting him under
Gridley, a greybeard with 40 years' experience. Unfortunately, many
Gridleys actually have one year's experience 40 times. Under them the new
banker learns the adage "never do something the first time."
   Being trained by your dad the CEO has similar pitfalls.
   Money-center banks. Heirs apparent used to have this second route
available - working for the family bank's correspondent bank. The money-
center would be delighted to take the CEO's son aboard for several years
and teach him banking. It knew this would cement the relationship with the
family bank, insuring correspondent business for years ahead.
   But many money-centers are now giving up correspondent business, because
the balances have been reduced sharply now that respondents' required
reserves must be kept with the Fed. As a result, correspondent balances
must come from money that otherwise could be lent or invested.
   Banker schools. There are complaints that they treat all students alike.
   What's wrong with that? The gripe is that those who'll wind up running
their family banks don't get the instruction and insight they'll need -
that instead they learn what a lending officer in a larger regional needs
to know, or a branch manager of a major bank.
   This, some critics say, is why the major banking schools are not drawing
the students they used to. Ignoring their own marketing courses, the
schools fail to segment the markets for their programs.
   Despite these problems, the family-run bank is not dead. But like other
traditions that have made community banking unique, it is becoming less of
a force. And the urge to merge is only one reason.
   Mr. Nadler is a contributing editor of the American Banker and professor
of finance at Rutgers University Graduate School of Management.

EYE ON THE STATES: MASS. TRADE GROUP REVIVES WITH MISSION TO SWAP IDEAS

By JONATHAN D. EPSTEIN
A Massachusetts bank trade group is waking up from a long hibernation,
abandoning old lobbying efforts in favor of helping its independent bank
members boost their bottom lines through cooperative efforts.
   After several years of inactivity, and hardly any meetings, the
Massachusetts Independent Bankers Association is seeking to draw community
banks together to exchange policies and ideas related to lending, human
resources, and marketing.
   In particular, officials want the association to establish common credit
criteria to make loan participations among members easier, without having
to work with a larger bank that "might look to take the customer away,"
said association president Jim D. Carey, president of Slade's Ferry Bank,
Somerville.
   "We felt that independent commercial banks have a few common interests,"
Mr. Carey said. "There are a few things that we can do together to help our
bottom line."
   By sharing policies and practices relating to employee benefits and
marketing, the banks will help those smaller members who can't afford to
hire full-time staffs or pay advertising agencies to develop campaigns, he
explained.
   Mr. Carey said the wave of consolidation sweeping the industry has only
strengthened the belief among community bankers that they will survive and
prosper because they can better serve customers. But "I think we need to
help each other with the burden of regulation and the management of bottom
lines."
   "It's going to be much more one on one, trying to assist each other and
managing our institutions in the marketplace to preserve our independence
and share our common management concerns and solutions so that we don't end
up fading out of existence," he said.
   In the past, the group, which was formed about 25 years ago and is an
affiliate of the Independent Bankers Association of America, focused its
attention on influencing banking legislation on Beacon Hill in Boston and
on Capitol Hill in Washington. But as the group's members were gobbled up
by mergers, its influence and activity dropped off.
   Last April, in response to a push from IBAA officials to restart the
group, officials from about 13 banks met to discuss the organization's
future.
   Richard D. Driscoll, president of the Massachusetts Bankers Association,
said he was unaware of the Massachusetts Independent Bankers' recent
activities.
   "If there is a need for one more group, they'll get members," he said.
"But if banks don't feel there's a need, they won't join."
   He added that the Massachusetts Bankers has added about 15 new small-
bank members in the last two years. In fact, he said, every commercial bank
in Massachusetts is an active member except Mr. Carey's bank.
   Still, Mr. Carey said the Massachusetts Independent members concluded
that the group should no longer try to provide lobbying or educational
services to its members anymore, because the Massachusetts Bankers
Association and other organizations already filled that need better than
the independent bankers group could.
   "Their expertise is in the legislative efforts and the educational
efforts, and we believe you should render to Caesar what is Caesar's," Mr.
Carey said. "They're every good at what they do, and our thrust is a little
different."
   Mr. Carey said the group has stressed to the Massachusetts Bankers
Association that it's not trying to compete. Already the association
includes 20 banks, with 13 other potential members, all with less than $250
million in assets.
   Mr. Carey said officials haven't ruled out cosponsoring a seminar with a
larger organization, but "that's not our thrust. There are organizations
that do that well."

SBA SAYS 1ST NATIONAL LEADS IN NEW ENGLAND

HARTFORD, Conn.
The Small Business Administration ranked First
National Bank of New England the largest lender of SBA-guaranteed
commercial loans under its flagship 7(a) program in New England.
   The agency, in releasing its 1995 fiscal year figures, shows First
National Bank of New England as the region's largest 7(a) lender by a wide
margin. First National Bank originated 85 loans during the year, for a
total of $40.7 million. Based on dollar volume, the bank, which has its
corporate headquarters in Hartford, Conn., ranks sixth in the nation. It is
the leader in New England for the second consecutive year.
   "Most of our clients are privately owned manufacturers and distributors
who use the SBA-guaranteed loans to invest in equipment, facilities, or
marketing programs that make them more globally competitive, " said Brian
J. Charlebois, executive vice president and head of commercial banking.
   Only two other New England-based banks ranked in the top 50 on the SBA's
1995 list. The bank's SBA loan volume, for instance, was five times that of
Bank of Boston, which was ranked 43d. First New Hampshire Bank was ranked
23.

AGRICULTURE: FARM LENDERS HARVESTED A DECENT CROP IN '95

By BARBARA F. BRONSTIEN
Last year was a fairly good one for farm lenders.
   The year "turned out to be generally quite good for American
agriculture," said Marvin Duncan, chairman of the agricultural economics
department at North Dakota State University, Fargo. "Prices are ... high
enough so there will essentially be no government subsidies in the form of
deficiency payments."
   But in agriculture, you take the bad with the good. Farmers and lenders
saw individual areas hit with weather- and disease-related woes and
industry-specific troubles, such as the cattle industry's price dip.
   And so, this year farm bankers will have a keen eye on the
struggling areas such as the cattle industry. And they await with mixed
feelings word on the 1995 farm bill from Washington.
   Cattle producers face additional years of low prices as supply exceeds
demand and producers begin selling off breeder animals to ultimately reduce
supply. However, this liquidation initially will increase the supply even
further.
   "It's going to be a pretty tough time in '96, '97 for the cattle
sector," said Bill Helming, an agricultural consultant in Olathe, Kan.
"We've got the prices below the cost of production already, and we haven't
even started liquidation. That's going to add insult to injury."
   The dairy industry also has not seen price increases in several years,
said Alec Bridges, president and chief executive of $240 million-asset
Sulphur Springs (Tex.) State Bank, who has numerous dairy customers.
   "The performance is not as good as it's been," Mr. Bridges said. "We're
not having any real horror stories. We had tightened our underwriting
standards and made sure that they performed to the point that we could go
with them when things weren't as good."
   On the other hand, grain prices rose this year, a result of a wet spring
and early frost that brought a "short" crop, reducing supply.
   "Most farmers who are producing and selling grain have less grain to
sell, but they're going to have the opportunity to sell it for a higher
price," Mr. Helming said.
   If he were a lender, he said, he'd be encouraging his customers "to take
advantage of these higher prices and sell into it. Farmers typically don't
sell when the market's going up; they sell when the market's low. I know it
doesn't sound logical, but that's the way it's been done for 50 years."
   Mr. Helming said that although the tendency of farmers to sell at the
worst time has improved - more farmers are using better farm marketing
techniques to reduce the risk of price fluctuations - it's still a problem.
   "When the market's going up, they think it's going to go higher," he
said. "When the market's going down, they're reluctant to sell. And by the
time they sell, it's a lot lower."
   The higher prices also made the industry less anxious over the yet-to-
be-determined government farm program, said Larry Knutson, president of
State Bank of Blomkest, Minn., and current president of the Upper Midwest
Agricultural Credit Council.
   "We're cautiously optimistic about next year," Mr. Knutson said.
"Production looks like it's going to be a pretty good year."
   Still, farmers and lenders alike continue to wait for the 1995 Farm Bill
to learn what government policy will be on farm subsidies.
   "There was lots of discussion about the Farm Bill, and we still don't
have it," said Philip M. Burns, president of Farmers and Merchants National
Bank, West Point, Neb., and the current chairman of the American Bankers
Association's agriculture lenders committee.
   Practically speaking, Congress should implement a Farm Bill in January
or February so farmers - and lenders - can organize their 1996 planting,
Mr. Helming said. "There are a lot of decisions to be made in planting as
you get into the spring," he said.
   The consensus is that government subsidies to farmers will be
diminished, whatever the ultimate bill.
   Mr. Helming expects the legislation to take the form of the Freedom to
Farm Act. "That's what bankers ought to plan for, which means their
customers are going to end up being totally dependent on the real-world
supply and-demand forces in the marketplace, as opposed to the safety net
of the government."
   This development has led farm bankers, already a conservative bunch, to
become more cautious, said Mr. Duncan of North Dakota State.
   "More risk is going to be placed on the shoulders of the farmer than in
the past," he said. "They will want to have a full understanding of the
risk management techniques that their customers are going to be pursuing.
The bottom line for the next one to five years is substantially greater
uncertainty in agriculture."

COLORADO BANKERS FIGHTING AN EXPANSION IN DENVER

By JAMES B. ARNDORFER
Colorado bankers are going to the courts to block a credit union
expansion.
   The Colorado Bankers Association is suing the state banking agency for
permitting $84.4 million-asset Gates Credit Union to expand its membership
base to include the southern metropolitan area of Denver - nearly 300,000
people.
   Craig Umbaugh, a lawyer representing the bank trade group, said the
expansion runs roughshod over state laws that restrict community expansions
to no more than 25,000 or to the regulator's discretion.
   "The Department of Financial Institutions has exceeded the clear
language of the statute," Mr. Umbaugh said. "I think this expansion has
wiped away half the statute."
   The association filed suit last Thursday against the Colorado
Financial Services Board, which has some oversight over the Division of
Financial Services. The five-member board - which includes three credit
union executives - approved the Gates expansion on Nov. 28 despite bankers'
objections at a public hearing.
   "It's not unexpected," said David L. Paul, commissioner of the division.
"They had been fairly forthright with our legal counsel that that's where
they were headed."
   Steve Newell, chairman of the Financial Services Board and president of
Colorado State Employees Credit Union, said the board considered all the
evidence, including that submitted by bankers in Gates' proposed expansion
area, when it approved the expansion.
   "The issue boiled down to whether or not the area of expansion was a
defined community," he said. "Overall, the board felt that the credit union
itself should be able to define what they consider to be a community."
   Gates Credit Union was seeking to expand out of uncertainty over the
future of its membership base, employees of Gates Rubber Co., said Carroll
Beach, president of the Colorado Credit Union League. The company had been
cutting employees for years.
   Bankers object to the size of the expansion, saying it does not
represent a distinct community, as required by statute.
   Donald Childears, president of the Colorado Bankers, said the credit
union's new membership base included several political districts and a
spectrum of income and demographic groups.
   Robert Wilson, a Denver lawyer who represents Gates Credit Union, would
not comment on the bankers' objections.
   "We're still in the process," he said.

SCORECARD: GOOD PERFORMANCE MARRED BY CRISES

By JAMES B. ARNDORFER
1995 was a banner year for credit unions, as capital levels hit
historic highs and delinquency continued a decade-long decline.
   Too bad nobody noticed. Instead, the industry busily set about making a
spectacle of itself for most of the year, beginning with the collapse of
$1.6 billion-asset Capital Corporate Federal Credit Union - Cap Corp - in
January.
   And both the industry and its regulator added to that debacle with flubs
throughout the year.
   Before 1995 was over the industry and the National Credit Union
Administration came under fire during congressional hearings. The Credit
Union National Association and the industry's top regulator were at each
others' throats. The chief executive of the industry's primary liquidity
facility resigned under a cloud and warned of looming problems.
   And to cap the year off, CUNA president Ralph Swoboda was deposed by the
trade group's board and state leagues.
   But in interviews with several industry leaders, the Cap Corp situation
emerged repeatedly as the single most important event of the year.
   It's not hard to see why.
   The largest failure in industry history triggered a series of
congressional hearings in which lawmakers - particularly in the Senate -
browbeat the industry for speculating in collateralized mortgage
obligations and ripped the NCUA for allowing it.
   "The most important thing was the closing of Cap Corp because it brought
credit unions into the light," said Charles O. Zuver, director of
governmental affairs for the Credit Union National Association. "It
generated legislation in the Senate and dissension in the credit union
movement."
   Chastened, the NCUA in April issued a regulation limiting corporate
investments that was so unpopular that the agency withdrew it even before
the comment period expired. The regulator has since been crafting a new
plan with the corporates that has the industry's liquidity centers
significantly more comfortable.
   "We're very encouraged" about the agency's willingness to cooperate,
said Richard M. Johnson, chief executive of Western Corporate Federal
Credit Union, San Dimas, Calif. "We think the regulator is going to be more
comfortable with us because he's taken a hard look at us."
   A rule affecting corporate investments alone would have a powerful
impact on the industry, but now the agency also is looking to tighten the
investment regulations of regular credit unions. Part of the inspiration
was the agency's finding that many institutions failed to understand the
risks of collateralized mortgage obligations - the same instruments that,
indirectly, led to the fall of Cap Corp - in their portfolios.
   Some industry experts have already slammed the proposal as requiring too
much paperwork.
   Mr. Swoboda, the former CUNA president, predicted that the struggle to
set new investment limits for the industry will be the pivotal event of
this year.
   "There'll be a stir over the investment regulations for natural person
credit unions and corporates," he said.
   The NCUA's decision to seize Cap Corp intensified the already hostile
relations between the NCUA and the industry - sparking a dissent on the
NCUA board from board member Robert Swan. Many in the industry -
particularly Cap Corp depositors that lost money - believed the regulator
could have saved the corporate if it had so desired.
   Acrimony was already present between segments of the industry and the
NCUA because of a rule approved in 1994 that would end trade group
management of corporates. The CUNA and the National Association of State
Credit Union Supervisors sued the agency in February in an effort to kill
the rule.
   But in September the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
Virginia ruled in the agency's favor. CUNA decided to drop its suit, but
state supervisors are pursuing their case against what most observers
consider to be heavy odds.
   At the same time, the agency and some industry figures have said they
think the federal court's decision might provide an opening for better
relations.
   "That's behind us now," said NCUA Chairman Norman E. D'Amours.
"Relations have been improving dramatically toward the latter part of the
year."
   That, however, remains to be seen: Pentagon Federal Credit Union, which
lost $1.1 million in Cap Corp, in October sued the NCUA to try to obtain
documents detailing the agency's reasons for imposing conservatorship on
Cap Corp.
   When credit unions weren't taking shots at the regulator, it seemed they
were fighting among themselves.
   Competition among credit unions became a big issue, with many
institutions protesting the proposed merger of the aggressive Patelco
Credit Union, San Francisco, and First Technology Federal Credit Union,
Beaverton, Ore. The complainants appeared to have the sympathy of Mr.
D'Amours, who has stressed the need for cooperation among credit unions,
and the merger was called off once it became clear NCUA wasn't going to let
it happen.
   And, the industry's largest trade group went through a meltdown during
the year, leading off with a management shakeout at the industry's main
liquidity center, U.S. Central Credit Union, which CUNA controlled.
   Early on, former U.S. Central president James R. Bell and blamed CUNA-
appointed board members for problems suffered by the company. A few months
later the Overland Park, Kan., institution was slapped with a low
performance rating by the NCUA.
   The industry's largest trade group was bruised on other fronts. Facing a
revolt from its affiliated state leagues, the association flip-flopped -
first supporting, then opposing - a Senate bill to strengthen NCUA's
oversight of state-chartered credit unions, a move that irked the bill's
sponsor, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.
   After this setback, Mr. Swoboda announced a sweeping review of the
association's structure, and the state leagues began gunning for him, trade
group sources said.
   To make matters worse at the trade group, losses blossomed at the Card
Services division of CUNA Service Group, a CUNA subsidiary.
   The board and other CUNA interests apparently believed that new blood
was the only cure for its problems. In October, it fired Mr. Swoboda, who,
before his departure, sacked some of his lieutenants.
   Even if credit unions continue to thrive this year, some of the ugly
events of 1995 are expected to work themselves to resolution - some
probably tortuously.
   "Credit unions have done very well; the confusion has all been in the
superstructure," said Ken Robinson, president of the National Association
of Federal Credit Unions.

VISA GUARANTEES CAR RENTALS AT PEAK TIMES

By MICKEY MEECE
At the behest of major car rental companies, Visa U.S.A. has introduced
a guaranteed reservation service for peak travel times.
   Visa said the service was available beginning Monday at participating
renters, including Hertz, Avis, National, and Budget. Cardholders who give
their account numbers at the time of their reservation can be assured that
a car will be awaiting them.
   To attack a growing "no show" problem, the rental companies will offer
guarantees when demand is high, mainly around holiday periods and special
events. The service will be similar to the hotel late-arrival guarantees
that customers can secure with credit card numbers.
   Visa, the first of the major card groups to introduce the car-rental
convenience, said users will no longer have to book cars at a number of
agencies to make sure they get one. By reducing the number of no-shows, the
rental companies should be able to manage their fleets better.
   As a byproduct of the guarantees, renters would penalize no-shows. Visa
no-shows would have to pay as much as a one-day rental fee if they do not
cancel reservations at least eight hours before the scheduled pickup.
   American Express Travel Related Services Co. is developing a similar
service, which a spokesman said could be available in the first quarter. A
no-show penalty of up to two days would kick in if a reservation was not
canceled 48 hours in advance.
   MasterCard International does not have a rental guarantee in the works,
a spokesman for that association said, because "we haven't seen a great
deal of interest in something like this."
   Visa said the service is voluntary. Cardholders can still reserve cars
in the customary manner.
A guarantee ensures that customers whose rental cars cannot be
delivered in an hour will be transported to their destinations, provided
with cars within eight hours, and given a free day's rental.
   Under American Express' proposed plan, if a rental company overbooked
and did not have the customer's vehicle, it would have to secure a
comparable one from another firm. If it could not do so, the rental agency
would provide an alternative vehicle at a rate no higher than the original
car and it would waive the first day's fee.
   American Express and Visa, which are first and second, respectively, in
car rental charge volume, said the rental companies came to them this year
seeking a solution to the no-show problem. No-show rates go as high as 70%
during peak periods.
   Not all rental agencies have committed to the guarantee service. A
spokeswoman for Alamo Car Rental said the company is evaluating it and has
not made a decision.
   Janet Maizner, a spokeswoman for Value Rent a Car, said, "We normally
take a wait-and-see attitude" to any new service that other agencies adopt.
   "Overall, it's a good move for the industry," Ms. Maizner said, adding
that it is hurt by "double and triple booking."
   Visa also is introducing an advance deposit program, allowing customers
to charge a deposit for rentals of up to 14 days. The association plans to
change its rules and procedures to permit the car rental deposits, similar
to an adjustment made in 1989 for hotels.

NEW NICHE: WISING UP DIRECT MARKETERS ABOUT WHO JUST WANTS TO BE LET
ALONE

By LISA FICKENSCHER
Marketers' obsession with buying and building massive customer data
bases has created a seemingly contradictory subspecialty - removing the
names of people who prefer not to be on mailing or telemarketing lists.
   It has become the law for direct marketers of everything from credit
cards to long-distance services to respect consumers' desires to be let
alone. But the advent of several companies in the "list suppression"
business indicates there is profit in it.
   "Honoring a customer's request is just good business," said Dick
Gallagher, president of the Signature Group, a company that offers credit
card enhancements, has added a service called "Do Not Solicit."
   Indeed, businesspeople are coming around to the view that privacy - and
the publicity they get from disseminating privacy protection policies - can
be a valuable commodity.
   "Privacy protection is going to become increasingly a service in America
far beyond list suppression," said Alan F. Westin, editor and publisher of
the newsletter Privacy and American Business.
   A handful of companies, including a list broker working on the World
Wide Web of the Internet, are apprising direct marketers of the names of
people who don't want to be solicited as sales prospects.
   The Signature Group's "Do Not Solicit" list helps companies comply with
the Telephone Consumer Act. A rule that the Federal Trade Commission added
to that legislation in August requires telemarketers to maintain lists of
people who don't want to be called again. The rule went into effect on
Sunday.
   The Schaumburg, Ill.-based Signature Group claims to be the only company
that electronically gathers such information and will compile a list for a
client marketer within 48 hours. That could significantly shorten the
process of removing names from a mailing list, which the group says
averages 45 days in the banking industry.
   Consumers get angry if they're called after asking for their names to be
struck off marketing lists, said Fanette Singer, a spokeswoman for
Signature Group. They want their names removed promptly, she said.
   The Direct Marketing Association has been providing a telephone
suppression service for its members since 1985. But Patricia Faley, vice
president of consumer affairs for the Washington-based trade group, pointed
out that its service is not required by law.
   About 600,000 consumers are on the association's telemarketing
suppression list, and three million are on a mail suppression list that was
begun in 1971. Consumers who appear on those lists are not solicited by a
variety of marketers; in contrast, the Signature Group provides its service
to one client company at a time.
   The Signature Group tracks people who are contacted by companies that,
for example, sell merchandise to bank customers. As the list provider, the
bank is legally responsible for compliance with the telemarketing law, even
though it may not be calling its customers directly.
   Another service, Buyer's Choice, has tapped into a different type of
consumer who is willing to be solicited for products and services but wants
to control who does the soliciting.
   "People are soon going to say, here are the news, the marketing, and the
people I want to reach me, and I don't want anyone else to reach me," said
Mr. Westin.
   Buyer's Choice, a division of the Polk Co. of Detroit, seems to be
responding to Mr. Westin's vision of the future. Polk, a provider of
demographic and lifestyle data, sends out consumer surveys asking people to
check off categories of products and services that interest them and those
that do not.
   Half a million people have completed the surveys. Keith Wardell, vice
president of Polk, expects the list to reach two million in a year.
   Buyers Choice has been gathering consumers' preferences for five years
but only recently have the surveys begun probing what kind of mail people
don't want to receive. About 20 major mailers, including catalogue
companies and travel clubs, are participating in a test of the service,
which Mr. Wardell said will be launched formally in the second quarter.
   Mr. Wardell estimates that people who complete the surveys will receive
about 20 pieces of mail annually from marketers subscribing to Buyer's
Choice, while 100 to 200 pieces of mail will be suppressed.
   The theory behind the service is that most people want to receive some
mail offers. The smallest opt-out category, for example, is women's
apparel, and the least popular offer are money market funds.
   To keep the list accurate, Buyer's Choice sends out its survey every six
months to people who have completed it.
   "Part of our intent is to stay in touch with those consumers," said Mr.
Wardell.
   Aurora, Ohio-based DM Group began compiling a list about four weeks ago
of people who don't want to be bothered by unwanted solicitations and
advertising, but its communications method is electronic mail.
   Robert Hicks, president of the five-year-old company, said he launched
the service because DM Group "came under a lot of heat when it came out
that we were managing E-mail lists."
   DM Group rents lists with about 250,000 names to marketers who want to
reach people via E-mail.
   But interest in the suppression list has been tepid so far, said Mr.
Hicks.
   Still, Mr. Westin believes the service is a significant development
because it recognizes that "E-mail deserves equal treatment with mail and
telephone preference (services), allowing people to opt out."
   "I think the DM Group has the right idea," added Mr. Westin. But he
suggested that companies put a question "up front" at their Web sites
giving surfers the opportunity to opt out of further unsolicited contact.

NATIONAL CITY UNIT BUYING 1ST DATA PAYMENT BUSINESS

By BETH PISKORA
National City Processing Co. has agreed to acquire the remittance
processing business of First Data Resources Inc.
   Under terms of the agreement, the Omaha-based card servicing unit will
outsource all of its clients' remittance activities exclusively to National
City. These functions include the opening, extracting, recording, and
posting of credit card payments with paper invoices.
   "This represents a 30% increase on our base of business," said Tony G.
Holcombe, chief executive officer of Louisville, Ky.-based National City
Processing, a subsidiary of $35 billion-asset National City Corp. of
Cleveland.
   "The additional transaction volume will bring us to 500 million
transactions annually" in the remittance processing area, added Mr.
Holcombe.
   Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. It is expected to close
within 60 days.
   "With the acquisition, NPC will be the largest remittance processing
company in the United States," said David R. Zook, executive vice president
of corporate services for National City Processing.
   "This is an exciting opportunity for us to build upon our existing base
of remittance processing business while further enhancing the service
provided to clients of First Data Resources," he added.
   The agreement includes a long-term arrangement for First Data Resources
to continue to market the remittance business to its clients, with the
National City unit serving as processor.
   "First Data is not a major player in this area and we felt our clients
deserved the service and competitive advantage only a leader such as NPC
could provide," said a spokeswoman for First Data Corp., the Hackensack,
N.J.-based holding company for First Data Resources.
   The spokeswoman said the remittance deal with National City was not
precipitated by First Data's recent merger with First Financial Management
Corp.
   "We were simply trying to find the best solution for our clients, and
National City Processing is a true leader in remittance processing," she
said.
   First Data Resources will continue to offer card embossing, cobranding
and relational data base marketing services, home banking, smart card
services, and processing for credit, debit, and commercial cards.

SKEPTICISM GREETS TV PREDICTION THAT GLENFED WILL BE SOLD IN '96

By BARTON CROCKETT
Does CNBC commentator Dan Dorfman have the inside word on the next big
California thrift merger?
   He certainly gave that impression on his Dec. 21 "Dorfman Report" when
he singled out $15.9 billion-asset Glendale Federal Bank as a "sure-fire
takeover within the next 12 months."
   Mr. Dorfman said Glenfed chairman Stephen J. Trafton is rumored to be
"aggressively shopping the company at over 30 bucks a share." He also
quoted "takeover forecaster" Steve Kroll, managing director of Monness,
Crespi & Hardt, as saying a takeover of Glenfed is likely at $30 a share,
for a total price of $1.2 billion.
   Potential buyers were said to be California thrifts Great Western
Financial Corp., H.F. Ahmanson & Co., and Golden West Financial Corp.
   Even on the basis of fundamentals, Mr. Dorfman said, Glenfed would be a
good buy. He quoted Mr. Kroll as saying Glenfed was likely to win in 1996 a
$1.5 billion lawsuit against the government over regulatory goodwill - a
victory that would boost earnings $10 to $12 a share. Mr. Kroll reportedly
set a 12-month price target of $23 to $24 in the absence of a buyout or a
victory in the lawsuit.
   The report forced a half-hour halt in trading of Glenfed's stock and
spurred a $1 rise, to $17.87. This was its high for the year, and more than
twice its 52-week low of $8.50 late in 1994. .
   A Glendale Federal spokesman said the bank would not comment on the
"Dorfman Report" item, as a matter of policy. In recent months, Mr. Trafton
has said in interviews that Glenfed is open to a takeover but isn't
counting on one.
   Many stock analysts, thrift executives, and investment bankers were
highly skeptical of Mr. Dorfman's analysis.
   They noted that Mr. Dorfman was hardly unique in predicting that a big
California thrift is likely to be acquired in the next year. Most analysts
expect a wave of takeovers to commence as soon as buyers are convinced that
the California economy has rebounded and that California thrifts' balance
sheets are on solid ground.
   "The possibility of Glenfed being a takeover candidate is certainly not
brain surgery," said Gary Gordon, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. But he
and other sources said that the $30 price seems too
high unless Glenfed wins the goodwill lawsuit, which is far from certain.
   These observers also said they see no signs that a big merger involving
Glenfed is in the works. It is more likely, they said, that Mr. Trafton
will focus on improving the company's performance over the next year in
order to get a higher price in a subsequent takeover.
   "Our read is that Trafton is looking to aggressively add value to the
Glendale franchise and then sell," said Gregory A. Mitchell, senior vice
president of Hovde Financial Inc., an
investment banking firm. There is "no question" that Mr. Trafton will wait
at least a year to sell Glenfed, Mr. Mitchell added.
   "It doesn't feel like anything's imminent," said a senior thrift
executive with a big Glenfed rival, who asked not to be named.
   Many observers said they see much to recommend in-market mergers of
California thrifts, including a combination of Glenfed with any number of
other Southern California institutions. But they said they doubted
any of the three thrifts Mr. Trafton mentioned would be willing to pay the
kind of premium he'd be seeking in a takeover, or that Mr. Dorfman said
would be likely.

LOS ANGELES OFFICIALS URGE FED TO APPROVE FIRST BANK SYSTEM'S BID FOR
FIRST INTERSTATE

By BARTON CROCKETT
Richard J. Riordan is standing up for First Interstate again.
   The mayor of Los Angeles has teamed up with the president of his city
council to urge the Federal Reserve Board to reject Wells Fargo & Co.'s
application to acquire First Interstate Bancorp.
   The city "strongly opposes" Wells' bid for control of Los Angeles-based
First Interstate, Mr. Riordan and Council President John Ferraro wrote in a
letter dated Dec. 18.
   The letter, filed during the public comment period that ended late last
month, escalates the unusual level of political involvement in the battle
over First Interstate.
   Local politicians are typically silent about bank mergers, or else focus
their energies on trying to minimize office closings and layoffs.
   But Mr. Riordan and other prominent California politicians are openly
supporting the deal that First Interstate prefers - a merger with First
Bank System Inc. of Minneapolis.
   Speaking at an outdoor rally in November, Mr. Riordan professed "love"
for the chairmen of First Interstate and First Bank and said, "We look
forward to working with you for many, many years to come."
   The letter to the Fed details Mr. Riordan's reasons for opposing Wells'
bid while putting California's largest city in the position of trying to
influence federal policymakers.
   The Los Angeles officials said consumer banking services in California
would "be irreparably harmed" if San Francisco-based Wells bought First
Interstate. They said Wells' plans to close hundreds of traditional
branches and rely more on supermarket branches, automated teller machines,
and personal computers would benefit the well-to-do at the expense of the
poor.
   Lower-income communities "are chronically underserved by most retail
businesses, including supermarkets and banks," the letter said. "The
residents of these communities cannot afford expensive home computers and
often feel uncomfortable accessing ATMs in high-crime areas."
   The writers also warned that competition would suffer, as it was
"clearly diminished by the 1992 merger of BankAmerica Corp. and Security
Pacific Corp."
   "The proposed Wells Fargo/First Interstate consolidation
would have a similar impact," the city officials said.
   Raising concerns about broader economic impacts, Mr. Riordan and Mr.
Ferraro said Southern California would sustain "the vast majority" of the
7,000 to 10,000 job losses from a such a merger - an especially cruel blow
to Los Angeles County, where the 9% unemployment rate is already well above
the national average.
   Real estate markets would also suffer, they argued. First Interstate
owns or leases nearly 1.3 million square feet in four major buildings
downtown, an area where vacancy rates are high, at 20%. Office closures
"could completely destabilize (the Los Angeles) real estate market,
resulting in huge financial losses to owners and lenders throughout the
country," the letter said.
   Mr. Riordan and Mr. Ferraro also claimed that First Interstate would be
a better corporate citizen as part of First Bank than as part of Wells.
   "We have no doubt that Wells Fargo is prepared to make new commitments
to Los Angeles as part of its pending application," they said. "But we are
convinced that these commitments will inevitably fall well short of the
service and community involvement that Los Angeles enjoys today from First
Interstate Bank."

COMMENT: RELATIONSHIP MANAGERS NEED STRICT SALES GOALS

By CHARLES B. WENDEL
The title "corporate lender" has begun to disappear from the commercial
banking nomenclature in favor of the term "relationship manager."
   The relationship manager has significantly broader responsibility than
finding, underwriting, and monitoring loans. Ideally, he or she is a
coordinator of the sales process who evaluates customer needs, matches them
with the bank's products and services, identifies the most likely selling
opportunities, and brings in product specialists as needed.
   Unfortunately, this is largely a fantasy. It is still a distant goal
many banks have for relationship managers. Scratch the typical relationship
manager and what you find underneath is a traditional lender. The
relationship manager may sell cash management and other deposit services,
but it is rare to see the sale of products from other groups in the
organization.
   We estimate that among their best small and middle-market customers,
banks capture only a 5% to 10% "wallet share" of financial services
business. For example, no more that 60% of small-business owners who
maintain a commercial deposit account have their personal account at the
same bank.
   The gap between the intent of the relationship manager's job and its
reality needs to be addressed quickly and decisively. Among the reasons:
Many companies view lending as a commodity and not the basis for
differentiating one bank from another. But to achieve growth targets, banks
must emphasize wallet share over market share in many markets.
   Few senior managers would argue against the importance of building
customer relationships. Yet few banks are on the right path. There are four
major reasons:
   *Wrong messages. In a recent speech at a Robert Morris Associates
conference, Norwest Bank regional banking executive Scott Kisting
underscored the importance of communicating effectively with staff about
noncredit products. He said banks need to "celebrate" these sales to the
same extent they congratulate bankers for new loans.
   *Wrong or meaningless measurements. A banker at a well-respected
regional company told a story that is all too typical: He and his boss
would agree on annual goals for credit and noncredit product sales, but
during the year performance is never measured against those goals. And 12
months later, a new set of goals is agreed on, with the manager believing
that he is fulfilling his supervisory role.
   *Wrong products. Banks have not challenged themselves enough in
evaluating noncredit offerings from the customer's perspective. Are their
proprietary 401(k) investment options really as good as those offered by
nonbank competitors? Have cash management or custody products been
leapfrogged by others? Too many product developers are playing a game of
wishful thinking when it comes to product assessment.
   *Wrong people. Even after reengineering and downsizing, many banks
remain dominated by traditional "good old boys," not aggressive and
sophisticated financial consultants and salespeople. Upgrading relationship
manager staffing, either by improved training or replacing personnel,
remains critical to meeting market demands and exploiting opportunities.
   Ironically, within the small-business segment it is a nonbank that best
emphasizes the capturing of entire relationships. Merrill Lynch & Co.
focuses on meeting customer needs as opposed to a product demand, and its
people are rewarded for cutting across the organization to meet those
needs, whether personal, commercial and credit, investment, or risk-control
related. Through superior customer service, they are also skimming the
cream off the market.
   Bank managements must get beyond their delusions about relationship
managers by giving them a clear focus and setting priorities. In the near
term, a small centralized marketing unit can provide the expertise that
individual relationship managers may not possess. Management must rethink,
reduce, and in certain instances eliminate the relationship manager's
responsibility for maintenance, monitoring, and underwriting.
   Performance goals must be viewed as commitments. A higher level of
incentive compensation will widen the gap between the total compensation of
excellent and merely adequate performers. The alternative is to risk
becoming a provider of commodities and increasingly irrelevant to the
customer.
   Mr. Wendel is president of Financial Institutions Consulting, New York.

LENDERS ADJUSTING TO A NEW REALITY: TIGHTER BELTS

By SNIGDHA PRAKASH
As mortgage bankers prepare for a new refinancing wave, they are
struggling to digest the enduring effect of the last one - a strict new
emphasis on the bottom line.
   The signs were everywhere last year.
   In December, PNC Mortgage, Vernon Hills, Ill., announced it would no
longer buy loans from wholesale brokers, which wrote up to 20% of all PNC's
loans. The company said it was paying too much for low-quality loans, and
preferred to focus on writing loans through its own loan officers.
   Earlier in 1995, GE Capital Mortgage discontinued its retail lending
program, through which mostly small lenders had written GE loans. The
program had never generated large volumes, and reportedly did not make
enough profit to satisfy a more cost-conscious approach at GE.
   Some players chose to exit the mortgage business altogether. Notably,
Prudential Life Insurance Co.'s mortgage unit was put up for sale, and
Wells Fargo hired Norwest Mortgage Inc. to write its home loans.
   Industry executives say that a host of factors conspired to create a new
emphasis on cost cutting in a hitherto more relaxed business.
   The mortgage industry, which expanded to write a record $1 trillion of
loans in 1993, continues to be too large for current volumes - estimated at
$654 billion last year, and $765 billion this year. Fierce competition has
driven down prices, forcing a new focus on costs.
   And the influx of new capital, primarily from commercial banks, is
changing the economics of the industry. The largest lenders can afford to
buy, and constantly improve, expensive computer systems to originate and
service ever larger volumes of loans. At these companies, the costs of
originating and servicing each loan is consistently going down, and
everyone must strive to keep up.
   "The name of the game is keeping your costs down on everything, every
little operation - the cost of borrowing money, the cost of distribution to
the public," said David Loeb, chairman of Countrywide Credit Industries,
Pasadena, Calif.
   Within that context, Mr. Loeb and other executives said PNC's decision
to abandon the wholesale purchase of loans from mortgage brokers makes
eminent sense.
   "There's no money in wholesale lending. The brokers get everything and
then some," Mr. Loeb said. Countrywide is building up its direct business
with consumers, in order to decrease its reliance on third parties, he
said.
   Fees to mortgage brokers have climbed in the last few years, as lenders
jockey for volume by offering lucrative deals to brokers. Brokers these
days get not only all the origination fees but also a portion of the
servicing release premium, noted Saiyid T. Naqvi, chief executive of PNC
Mortgage.
   In addition, loans made by brokers tend to be refinanced more quickly,
he said. When rates go down, brokers are quick to resolicit their
customers. These and other factors led PNC to abandon the wholesale
business, Mr. Naqvi said.
   PNC's exit from wholesale lending is the latest sign that the mortgage
business is rationalizing, said Luke Hayden of Chemical Residential
Mortgage. In other words, players are adjusting their strategies to match
the real costs and profits of the mortgage business.
   So do the largest lenders, such as Countrywide, Chemical, and Norwest,
plan to follow PNC's lead?
   Not anytime soon. To exit wholesale lending or any other channel means
that you give up a whole segment of the market to your competitors, said
Mark Korell, group president of lender and investor services at Norwest
Mortgage Inc., Des Moines. That's something that a really large lender just
cannot afford to do.
   Still, Mr. Korell warned that if brokers charged too much, the pressure
to cut back on wholesale lending would mount.
   "Brokers have to compete with other forms of production, don't they? If
they take too much out of the equation, they're not going to be able to
stay in business," he said.
   "The moral of the story here is that the mortgage banking industry, like
every other industry, over time will act in a rational way," Mr. Korell
said. "Capital is movable. Not too many people are going to stay in a
business where they can't make adequate returns to their shareholders."

LAWMAKERS ASK PATIENCE FOR DEBTORS STRAPPED BY GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

By KAREN TALLEY and HEATHER TIMMONS
Two key lawmakers have asked the federal housing agencies to persuade
loan servicers to cut some slack for furloughed government workers who miss
mortgage payments.
   In identical letters sent Dec. 28 to the chairmen of Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, House Banking Committee Chairman Jim Leach urged that the
workers be "protected from unintended consequences of the budget impasse."
   The same day, Rep. Rick Lazio, chairman of the banking panel's housing
subcommittee, urged Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros
to extend forbearance to borrowers whose mortgages are held in Ginnie Mae
pools.
   The lawmakers were responding to the second government shutdown in six
weeks. Tens of thousands of government workers have been left without
paychecks because Congress and the Clinton administration are logjammed
over the budget.
   Observers don't expect the budget impasse to drive up delinquency rates
dramatically. Even so, federal employees run the risk of missing payments,
forcing lenders to decide what actions, if any, to take.
   Lawmakers "send out similar letters for natural disasters, so I guess
they put this in the same category," said Brian Chappelle, staff vice
president for the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.
   In his letters, Rep. Leach asked Fannie and Freddie - formally the
Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp. - to advise companies that collect and process mortgage loan payments
of options for dealing with delinquent borrowers.
   Specifically, he said, the agencies should instruct servicers to
consider borrowers' attitudes toward the debt and the reasons for missed
payments before declaring accounts in default.
   John Gibbons, a senior vice president at Freddie Mac, said that when it
received Rep. Leach's letter it was already notifying servicers that relief
is warranted under existing guidelines.
   A spokeswoman said Fannie Mae would decide this week how to proceed with
Rep. Leach's request. "We are very sympathetic to the situation and will
address the request," she said.
   Representatives from Ginnie Mae - a unit of HUD that is formally known
as the Government National Mortgage Association - could not be reached;
they are on furlough as part of the government shutdown.
   Lenders, meanwhile, said they have already snapped into action. GE
Capital Mortgage got hold of the lawmakers' letters on Dec. 28. It
immediately undertook a case-by-case review of defaults by federal
employees, a spokeswoman said.
   Capstead Mortgage Corp. said it is prepared to extend forbearance to
customers who ask for extra time to make payments, said Bill Ruduff,
executive vice president of servicing.
   Some banks have begun broader programs to help federal workers through
thin times. United Jersey Bank, for instance, is offering unsecured
personal loans to people furloughed from the Social Security
Administration.

GE THROWS IN THE TOWEL ON RETAIL ORIGINATIONS

By JULIANA RATNER
One of the most striking developments on the mortgage scene in 1995 was
the decision by GE Capital Mortgage Services to stop originating
residential loans directly to consumers.
   For years, the Raleigh, N.C., company's hallmark had been its presence
in virtually every aspect of the home loan business - insuring mortgages,
servicing them, originating mortgages through correspondent lenders, and
marketing loans directly to the public.
   Its retreat in August was seen as an acknowledgement that GE Capital,
despite its prowess in wholesale originations, had not grabbed enough
business to be a force in the retail business. In the first half of 1995,
retail loans accounted for only 7% of the company's originations, which
totaled just under $1 billion.
   "There are certain lines of business in which a company either has to
become a major player or leave," said Rolland Johannsen, president of
Furash & Co., a Washington-based consulting firm.
   Mr. Johannsen said that, unlike banks, finance companies such as GE
Capital don't have to worry that customers will leave if they can't choose
from a wide array of financial services. In short, GE Capital has the
luxury of picking the services it offers.
   "Because they don't have to consider mortgage originations in terms of a
customer relationship, it becomes a straight decision on how they will
allocate capital," Mr. Johannsen said.
   To be sure, GE Capital still casts a big shadow in the mortgage
industry. The company continues to originate home loans through brokers and
smaller lenders, and to sell mortgage insurance products. Also, it services
a portfolio of loans that totaled $110 billion last June 30, second only to
Norwest Mortgage.
   A spokesman for GE Capital declined to comment for this report.
   Industry observers said it's unlikely that many companies will follow GE
Capital's lead.
   "For most companies retail is the appropriate road because they control
their own destiny in a very cyclical business," said David Lereah, chief
economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.

THRIFTS JUMPED ON FIXED-RATE BANDWAGON IN '95

By SNIGDHA PRAKASH
Sobered by the last refinancing boom, the nation's largest thrifts
decided in 1995 to plunge into the fixed-rate market.
   For more than a decade, most thrifts have stuck to making adjustable-
rate mortgages to hold in their portfolios -  a strategy aimed at earning
interest income while guarding against swings in market rates.
   But last year they decided they couldn't afford to sit out future fixed-
rate lending booms, and began to offer 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. As at
mortgage banks, the loans were intended for sale to the secondary market.
   "We're trying real hard to be competitive in those product lines, and to
get the word out to our realtors that they can come to us for things other
than just (cost-of-funds index) ARMs," said Fredric  J. Forster,
president of Home Savings of America, Irwindale, Calif.
   Mr. Forster said the thrift, which derives interest income from a $53
billion portfolio, wants fee income to bolster its bottom line. Income
derived from servicing mortgages - including those sold to other investors
- was seen as a natural fit.
   Beyond that, thrifts were keen to retain their market share and keep
their loan officers busy during periods when falling rates draw consumers
to fixed-rate loans. But as 1995 progressed, thrifts continued to lag
behind the overall market in fixed-rate originations.
   Sam Lyons, senior vice president at Great Western Bank, Chatsworth,
Calif., pointed to the "heart-wrenching discipline" of mortgage banking.
Mortgage bankers originate every loan knowing that it has to be sold into
the secondary market, he said.
   "It's kind of like salmon swimming upstream - they know where they are
going and what the goal is," Mr. Lyons said. By contrast, the focus at
thrifts is divided between originating loans to hold in portfolio and to
sell in the secondary market, making it more difficult to generate large
fixed-rate volumes.

AFTER ACQUISITION BINGE, NORWEST SEES MARKETING AS THE WAY TO GROW

By KAREN TALLEY
1995 was the year Norwest Mortgage broke into the most exclusive club
in mortgage banking, becoming one of just four companies with a servicing
portfolio topping $100 billion.
   Acquisitions have fueled most of the Des Moines company's growth,
helping it to more than double its servicing assets in two years.
   The Norwest Corp. unit plans to continue expanding this year. But now it
expects much of the growth to come from its own marketing efforts.
   Norwest Corp.'s chairman, Richard M. Kovacevich, contends that banks can
grow most efficiently by mining their customer bases for sales
opportunities.
   "The most effective way to gain revenue and profits is to cross-sell to
customers," he said.
   Norwest's focus on internal growth is likely to spread this year. Big
banking companies that bought mortgage businesses in the merger and
acquisition frenzy of the past two years are finishing the job of absorbing
these operations. The next step is to deliver on the cross-marketing
potential.
   For Norwest Corp., that means offering credit cards, consumer loans, and
private banking services to the mortgage unit's 1.2 million customers - and
offering mortgages across equally diverse product lines.
   Mr. Kovacevich said the mortgage unit's involvement is key to the cross-
selling blitz. Norwest customers - from mutual fund investors to checking
account users - often need mortgages, he said.
   And mortgage loans are the kinds of profitable products that Norwest
needs to stay ahead of competitors, Mr. Kovacevich said. "The war we are in
will be won on the field of revenue."
   Norwest Mortgage's president, Mark Oman, says it will take tremendous
cooperation among operating units for referrals to begin flowing. "The key
to success is how well the group works together as a team," he said.
   Observers agree. "Cross selling is still in its early stages," said Stan
Ross, managing partner at E&Y Kenneth Leventhal Real Estate Group, Los
Angeles. "So far there has been limited success."
   Much depends on whether banks can reach a lot of prospects without
sacrificing the personal touch that keeps customers coming back, he
continued.
   "You look at their approach," said Mr. Ross. "Did they use a personal
approach or a mailer? Bankers have to be very proactive in making sure the
customer understands the service."
   Because Norwest has a broad network of mortgage offices, it has a strong
shot at making its aspirations a reality, said Moshe A. Orenbuch, banking
analyst with Bernstein Research.
   With its hundreds of mortgage offices, Norwest could create "a

PNC UNIT WAS A LEADER AMONG LENDERS SEEKING NEW WAYS TO SELL WARES

By KAREN TALLEY
Finding new ways to deliver an old product - the mortgage loan - was a
big theme in 1995, and perhaps no company exemplified it better than PNC
Mortgage.
   In February, the PNC Bank Corp. unit teamed with Coldwell Banker Corp.
in a joint venture to market mortgages directly to homebuyers in real
estate agents' offices. The move gives PNC access to customers in 2,400
Coldwell Banker offices nationwide.
   Seven months later, PNC cut its ties with the 200 outside brokers that
had formed the backbone of its wholesale program, citing too much time and
expense in return for too little profit.
   Both strategies are too new to have proved their worth. But they typify
the creative approaches mortgage lenders are experimenting with these days.
   PNC isn't alone in testing new techniques. In September, for example,
Wells Fargo & Co. stopped extending mortgage loans to its customers,
handing this task off to Norwest Corp.'s mortgage unit.
   Changes like these don't always proceed smoothly. For PNC, the decision
to revamp distribution channels was swiftly followed by a shake-up in its
executive ranks. In November, the company unexpectedly promoted its
president, Saiyid Naqvi, to chief executive, replacing Walter C. Klein Jr.
   PNC said Mr. Klein resigned to pursue other opportunities. But industry
observers said he was eased out after PNC Bancorp decided its mortgage
group didn't need two top executives.
   Mr. Naqvi clearly has high hopes for the Coldwell Banker venture, dubbed
Home Mortgage Network. In an interview last year, he said he expects the
venture to originate about $3 billion of loans annually. PNC Mortgage's
originations totaled $2.3 billion in the first six months of 1995.
   The decision to scrap the wholesaling effort, meanwhile, got positive
reviews from observers.
   PNC is better off, because margins are "very thin" on the wholesale
side, said James M. Schutz, senior bank analyst at Chicago Corp. The
company, he added, already "has a great distribution network" through its
own loan officers and PNC bank branches.
   Industry observers agree that independent brokers are harder to keep
tabs on than in-house sales representatives. Brokers may also lack the kind
of loyalty that would compel them to present very good credits to their
wholesalers, some observers said.
   "It's incumbent upon brokers not to foul the system up by throwing in
bad-quality loans," said Walter W. Vail, executive vice president at
Graystone Mortgage Corp., Boston.
   Still, he said, PNC's decision to drop its broker network probably won't
be widely followed.
   "For every one that drops out another five get in the wholesale
business," Mr. Vail said. "The only way larger institutions will get to
smaller guys in communities is through brokers."

NASD PROPOSAL ON BROKER-DEALERS IS WELL RECEIVED

By WILLIAM PLASENCIA
After three months of fine-tuning, the National Association of
Securities Dealers has issued its final proposal to create a new framework
for bank-affiliated broker-dealers.
   The proposal now goes to the Securities and Exchange Commission for
further review. Final approval is expected by midyear, industry lawyers
said.
   "These rules are intended to eliminate any confusion between uninsured
securities products of broker-dealers and insured deposit products of
financial institutions," said John E. Pinto, executive vice president of
regulation at the NASD. The association, based in Washington, sets
professional standards for the brokerage industry.
   The plan contained few surprises, apart from its size. It came in at
1,235 pages.
   "I think the meat of it will be in the first 65 pages," said Sarah A.
Miller, senior government relations counsel for the American Bankers
Association. She said the NASD, which took its first crack at the rule in
November 1994, had addressed most of the banking industry's concerns.
   The initial draft drew bankers' wrath, with many saying it conflicted
with or duplicated existing rules of bank regulators.
   Mr. Pinto said the association had "honestly taken into account the
comments made by our members. We've tried to insure consistency with the
guidelines that have already been issued by bank regulators."
   The proposal, issued last Thursday, did leave intact certain provisions
that banks had lobbied hard to change.
   For example, the NASD kept a provision that prohibits brokerages from
directly compensating bank employees for referrals. And the agency still
requires that bank customers give written permission before information
about their finances can be shared with brokers.
   Under the proposal, banks would be able to share customers' names,
addresses, and telephone numbers, as well as credit reports, with
affiliated brokerages. Bankers had argued that such information sharing is
crucial to their cross-marketing efforts.
   Ms. Miller said the NASD still needs to clarify some points. For
instance, the proposal limits investment sales in areas "where retail
deposits are taken," but does not explain exactly what this means, she
said.
   But for the most part, bank brokerage executives could find little to
complain about.
   "It almost appears that everything we took exception to was stricken,"
said Joel Calvo, president of PNC Brokerage Corp., Pittsburgh.
   For instance, Mr. Calvo said he was pleased that the NASD dropped a
requirement for brokers to give a lengthy explanation of how Securities
Investor Protection Corp. insurance works.

COMMENT: A LIFE INSURANCE TIME BOMB IN TRUST - AND HOW TO DEFUSE IT

By TED S. BERNSTEIN
Trust departments are confronting substantial liability associated with
the life insurance policies held by trusts under their management.
   However, few banks recognize the potential liability they face. The
stakes are huge, with a potential price tag of tens or even hundreds of
millions of dollars.
   At issue is the estimated $1 trillion in face value of life insurance
policies held by irrevocable trusts.
   Most of these policies were purchased to generate funds to satisfy
federal estate tax liabilities. However, insufficient management of the
policies and today's volatile insurance and financial markets have put the
value of many policies at risk.
   In addition, trust departments are solely responsible for managing
assets in the best interests of the trust and its beneficiaries. If the
policies under a trust department's control fall short, it will be
difficult for banks and trusts to escape liability when beneficiaries
contend that insurance policies were managed inefficiently.
   Already, Crown Life Insurance Co. and New York Life Insurance have paid
$50 million and $65 million respectively to settle lawsuits claiming
vanishing premium fraud. In the suits, disgruntled policyholders contended
that the insurers had promised that premium payments would end after a
specific period. But when policies failed to perform as expected, insurers
demanded additional premiums to keep policies in force. These consumer
issues undoubtedly will spill over into trust management, and banks could
be the focus of policyholders' wrath.
   It is important to understand that trust officers at most banks and
trusts lack the training to review or manage life insurance policies. In
addition, over the past 15 years the life insurance industry has introduced
a variety of products that make purchase decisions more complex.
   Many trust officers try to minimize their liability by holding insurance
policies from carriers with excellent credit ratings. However, it's just
not that simple. The lawsuits being filed today are not claiming damages
due to carrier failures; the basis for these lawsuits is policy
performance.
   Three scenarios most likely to expose banks and trusts to liability
include:
   *Failing to analyze the difference between vanishing premiums and level
premiums.
   *Holding inappropriate or obsolete life insurance policies.
   *Failing to purchase enough life insurance for the premiums paid.
   Beneficiaries and their attorneys could evaluate these issues to
determine whether a policy has performed in accordance with its objectives.
   One situation commonly overlooked by trust departments is adverse health
ratings applied when a policy was first issued.
   Assume that in 1988 an overweight nonsmoking male purchased a $5
million, 15-year level term policy owned by an irrevocable trust. Because
he was overweight, the annual premium payment of $15,000 was 33% higher
than the standard rate.
   Now, seven years later, the insured - no longer overweight - would pay
$10,000 annually for the same death benefit. Or he could maintain his
premium at $15,000 but purchase $1.75 million in additional coverage.
   When the insured dies and the trust begins distributing its funds, the
beneficiaries review the policy and discover that the trust could have
purchased $1.75 million in additional life insurance without increasing
premiums. They decide to sue the bank or trust for mismanagement.
   However, the beneficiaries do not seek $5,000 - the difference in annual
premiums. They seek $1.75 million in damages - the difference in death
benefit.
   Considering that some banks manage as many as 4,000 trusts, the
potential liability is staggering. This example represents one of the many
potential issues banks and trusts confront.
   However, today's prudent-investor laws provide these institutions with
the ability to limit their exposure and liability - particularly if they
obtain the necessary expertise to review the policies of each trust.
   Banks and trusts can significantly reduce their exposure to liability
through several steps.
   Establish corporate policy. Banks should determine whether to absorb the
cost of a policy review or pass the cost along to the trust. And if the
risk associated with life insurance policies is too great to manage, they
should get out of the irrevocable trust business.
   Determine how often policies will be reviewed. Most banks review
policies at least every two years.
   Select an experienced insurance consultant or firm to assess the life
insurance policies held by trusts. To keep the consultant's recommendations
impartial, banks and trusts should prohibit consultants from selling life
insurance policies to the trusts they evaluate.
   Demand more service from insurance companies. Have them provide the
ratings they receive from every service that evaluates them. Also, ask for
information about the junk bonds and troubled real estate held in the
company's portfolio as a percentage of its net worth.
   Policy reviews can generate significant client good will. By conducting
the reviews, banks and trusts help policyholders fully understand their
specific policies, often for the first time.
   The reviews also allow trust departments to demonstrate their active
management of trust assets. Finally, reviews help banks and trusts reduce
their exposure to liability.
   It's a "win-win" situation for all parties involved.
   Mr. Bernstein is president of Trustee Consulting Corp., a Chicago-based
firm that advises on personal trust issues.

TRUST RULES MAY BE EASED FOR MULTISTATE NATIONAL BANKS

By KATHARINE FRASER
National banks with trust departments operating in several states may
soon get a break on the cost of doing business.
   The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has issued a proposal that
would allow banks to account for all trust operations at their headquarters
rather than having to maintain separate books in each state they do
business in.
   Trust bankers see the OCC proposal - outlined in a Dec. 21 letter - as a
welcome reprieve. Currently, national banks with trust operations in two or
more states must maintain staffs in each state that do nothing but prepare
for state examinations.
   "It's a lot easier to run a business under a single regulatory roof,"
said David J. Kundert, chairman and chief executive officer of  Banc One
Corp.'s investment management and trust group.
   Mr. Kundert believes that a relaxation of regulatory demands could help
Banc One compete with nonbank investment managers that do not have to
adhere to the same regulations as national banks.
   "You need to level the playing field to compete with those kind of
firms," Mr. Kundert said.
   First Bank System Inc., Minneapolis, is also supportive of the proposal,
according to a bank spokeswoman.
   The OCC proposal, if enacted, would represent the first major revision
of the agency's 32-year-old rule defining how fiduciary businesses can be
conducted by national banks whose trust businesses are also subject to
state regulations. The proposal comes on the heels of an OCC interpretive
letter issued on Dec. 8 that allows national banks to offer trust services
outside their home states without having to set up new branches.
   "Much about the national banks fiduciary business has changed since
(1963) including ... the structures and operational methods that banks use
to deliver those services," reads the OCC notice.
   While the OCC proposal would allow for accounting and business
administration to be streamlined, that does not mean that banks could use a
cookie cutter to deliver trust services to clients in different states.
   The agency writes that case-by-case determinations would be made whether
or not state laws regarding the conduct of trust relationships can be
preempted by federal oversight.
   "They have clearly opened the door to banks doing their administration
on a uniform basis out of the headquarters state," said John P.C. Duncan, a
partner at Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue, which counsels banks on interstate
issues.
   But, Mr. Duncan observes that the OCC is making a distinction between
streamlining bean-counts and implementing any standardized investment
policies.
   All 50 states have different "prudent investor" rules that govern what
types of investments are acceptable and how they should be disclosed.
   The OCC is inviting comment on how to minimize the differences among
investment laws so national banks can operate on a uniform basis.
   "We're dealing in a national environment now, and it's important that
banks and customers both know what law applies," Mr. Duncan said.
   State consumer interests and regulators have until Feb. 20 to submit
comments to the OCC.
   In the meantime, the affected banks are offering their support to the
proposed regulation.
   Banc One is a classic example of a banking company that stands to gain
much from this OCC proposal. The institution would like to whittle down its
far-flung banking operations to a single charter someday.
   Banc One has 60 affiliate banks in 11 states, compared with 88 three
years ago. In each state, there are three or four separately chartered
business units that all have to be accounted for.
   Other trust executives at banks with similar situations would welcome
any opportunity to centralize the business.
   "The current approach is encumbered by a variety of different
regulations," said Daniel E. Klimas, KeyCorp's executive vice president for
private banking and investing. "This new proposal may offer us a more
economical way of offering those services," he added.
   Though Mr. Klimas said he is supportive of the OCC proposal, he expects
an onslaught of litigation from state regulators before anything is
resolved.
   Like Banc One, KeyCorp sees a clear benefit to consolidating the
reporting of its segmented trust departments.
   "We are supportive of anything that allows us to look at ourselves and
run a business on a national basis instead of several independently," Mr.
Klimas said.

HOPES FOR WIDER POWERS NOW PINNED ON COURTS, REGULATORS-NOT
CONGRESS

By JUSTIN FOX
When 1995 began, a new Republican majority on Capitol Hill seemed
poised to release banks from the shackles that had kept them a step or two
behind the rest of the financial services industry.
   No such luck.
   Instead, the good news for bankers came from the courts and the
regulators. The Supreme Court affirmed banks' right to sell annuities. The
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. cut premium rates to all-time lows. All the
banking regulatory agencies trumpeted regulation-cutting reforms.
   The only major banking legislation Congress approved was a Savings
Association Insurance Fund rescue that will - if President Clinton signs it
- cost banks and thrifts more than $20 billion.
   Should the industry look to Congress for answers in 1996? Probably not.
   Bank lobbyists say there is no predicting what lawmakers might do,
particularly if plans to follow the thrift fund fix with a merger of the
bank and thrift charters gain momentum.
   But the stalemate persists in the House of Representatives between
supporters of broader bank powers and insurance agents who want to protect
their turf. What's more, with elections looming, Congress is likely to
effectively shut down by summer.
   The courts and banking agencies, meanwhile, will keep on judging and
regulating. And they could take actions this year that have a big impact on
the business of banking.
   First up is the Supreme Court, which on Jan. 16 will hear oral arguments
in Barnett v. Gallagher, the attempt by Barnett Banks Inc. to overturn
Florida laws that keep it from selling insurance.
   Last January, the court ruled in banks' favor in a case challenging
North Carolina-based NationsBank's right to sell annuities, and many in the
industry expect a similarly favorable Barnett decision before midyear.
   Bank lawyers think the court also will decide to hear another important
banking case - dealing with credit card issuers' right to charge late fees
to out-of-state customers.
   A win in the Barnett case would let banks use current federal law to
launch insurance marketing efforts from branches in towns with fewer than
5,000 people.
   It also would likely embolden Comptroller of the Currency Eugene A.
Ludwig. The comptroller laid off proposals to expand bank powers last year
after receiving a series of stinging letters on insurance and other issues
from House Banking Committee Chairman Jim Leach.
   If the Supreme Court acts and Congress does not, the door will be opened
for Mr. Ludwig to revive his plans to let bank subsidiaries move into lines
of business now generally off-limits to banks.
   But if the Supreme Court hands banks a victory, insurance agents are not
likely to sit idly by. "It could whip them into a frenzy," said Kenneth
Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association
of America.
   All this points to rough sailing for Rep. Leach's bid to break down some
of the Glass-Steagall Act barriers that keep commercial banks out of the
securities business. In September, insurance agents' pressure led House
leaders to combine Rep. Leach's bill with a regulatory relief measure and a
moratorium on the Comptroller's ability to grant banks new insurance
powers, making for a legislative stew unpalatable to most banking groups.

   Rep. Leach will keep fighting for passage of his bill, Mr. Guenther
said, but others believe it is more likely that regulatory relief - along
the lines of the bill approved in September by the Senate Banking
Committee, which doesn't touch the controversial Community Reinvestment Act
- will be decoupled from Glass-Steagall and enacted on its own.
   Then there's the charter merger. In return for being forced to chip in
almost $600 million a year for 22 years to help pay the interest on bonds
from the savings and loan bailout, commercial banks have clamored for an
end to the federal thrift charter.
   Thrifts now possess insurance, affiliation, and branching powers that
banks don't, and some in the industry see the charter merger as a back-door
way to improve the bank charter. But any major changes would run up against
the same forces that have halted Glass-Steagall reform, while an attempt to
force savings institutions into the existing bank charter would be fiercely
opposed by many thrifts.
   Thrifts also want to make sure the industry isn't forced to pay billions
in back taxes on their so-called bad-debt deductions as part of a charter
merger - although agreements by House and Senate tax writers late last year
put such fears largely to rest.
   "We do not want to see our people hurt because of this," said Randall
McFarlane, director of governmental relations for America's Community
Bankers, the leading thrift trade group.
   Thus, while Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, chairman of the Banking
Committee, has promised action on the charter merger by Easter, chances are
good that the issue won't be resolved this year.
   More likely to be dealt with in 1996 is a Federal Home Loan Bank System
modernization bill, which foundered in 1995 because of disputes over
dividing the 12 Home Loan Banks' payments on thrift bailout bonds.
   If Glass-Steagall reform indeed goes nowhere in 1996, bank groups plan
to start pushing regulatory buttons - urging the Federal Reserve Board to
let bank holding companies' section 20 subsidiaries get more of their
income from securities activities that banks themselves cannot engage in.
   Currently, such business - which includes underwriting municipal bonds,
dealing in consumer receivables, and underwriting corporate debt and equity
- can't provide more than 10% of the income of a bank holding company
subsidiary. Bank lawyers say the Fed has the legal leeway to raise that
limit as high as 49%.
   The Fed already has a proposal in the works to make the limit more
flexible. In a December speech, Fed governor Susan M. Phillips said the
board definitely will consider raising the limit if Congress fails to act.
   The Fed and the other banking agencies are also in the midst of
campaigns to rewrite their rules to reduce confusion and regulatory burden,
and make the examination process more "banker-friendly."
   The Comptroller's office has been most aggressive, mixing regulatory
relief with new powers for national banks. James D. McLaughlin, director of
agency relations for the American Bankers Association, said he doesn't
expect other regulators to go that far, but does see real reductions in
paperwork and other hassles on the horizon for bankers.
   The agencies also promised that the new community reinvestment rules
they approved in April will make life easier for banks and thrifts. Exams
under the new rules start this month, giving banks a chance to judge
whether their regulators were right.
   Also sure to show up in 1996 exams - particularly those by the Federal
Reserve and the Comptroller's office - is an increased emphasis on risk
management, something regulators talked about often in 1995.
   Then there are the deposit insurance premiums. Throughout 1995, banks
pushed the FDIC to cut them further and faster as the once-depleted Bank
Insurance Fund returned to health. But the industry had nothing more to
complain about after Nov. 14, when the FDIC cut most banks' premiums to the
legal minimum of $2,000 a year.
   In 1996, bank premiums can't go down any more. In fact, they will almost
certainly go up about 2 basis points as part of the thrift fund rescue.
   As of last week, however, the budget reconciliation bill that includes
the thrift fund plan was still caught in the tug-of-war between President
Clinton and Congress.
   The savings fund proposal, which would let the FDIC drop thrifts'
premiums to bank levels, is not the subject of any tension between the
President and Congress. But if the budget legislation were to collapse
completely and the thrift fund legislation were considered separately, 1996
would witness a Capitol Hill battle royal between thrift executives who
want their fund fixed and bankers who don't want to help pay for it, Mr.
Guenther said.
   No one is predicting that this is will happen. But then again, as 1995
showed, predictions can be wrong.

NATIONSBANK WANTS CLASS ACTION DENIED IN FAIR-LENDING LAWSUIT

By JARET SEIBERG
Trying to limit its potential liability, NationsBank Corp. asked a
federal judge last week to deny class-action status for a pending
fair-lending lawsuit.
   The bank charged the Washington Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights and
Urban Affairs with missing the deadline to seek class-action certification.
   "By failing to move for class certification by Dec. 20, 1995, which was
90 days from the date on which the class complaint was filed, plaintiffs
directly violated (the) local rule," the bank said in Dec. 26 memorandum
filed with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
"Accordingly, plaintiffs' class-action allegations should be stricken in
their entirety."
   John Relman, director of the fair-housing project at the Washington
Lawyers Committee, said the group hasn't missed the deadline. He declined
to elaborate, saying he will explain the group's position in a future court
filing.

   Class-action status is crucial to the lawyers committee's case, which
alleges that NationsBank discriminated against borrowers. The bank would
have much more to lose fighting a class action in court.
   Without class status, the case involves only 13 plaintiffs and nine loan
applications; even if NationsBank lost, the damage award would be limited.
But with class-action status, the lawyer's committee could seek
compensation for all similarly affected consumers. That could raise the
bank's tab dramatically.
   The bank also argued that the lawyers committee has had since its
December 1994 press conference announcing its fair-lending initiative to
search for clients. It said the group has employed a toll-free number,
meetings with community groups, and a "carefully orchestrated" media
campaign.
   Still, NationsBank noted that just 11 plaintiffs joined the lawsuit,
which was filed Sept. 21. Two months of publicity persuaded only one more
person to join the case, NationsBank told the court.
   "If the plaintiffs believe they have meritorious individual claims, they
should be required to litigate them as such," the bank said. "NationsBank
should be subjected to no further prejudicial adverse publicity tied to
grandiose promises of class-action litigation that the plaintiffs' counsel
have been unable to fulfill."
   NationsBank said this is not the first time the lawyers committee failed
to file its papers on time. It said in the memorandum that a federal judge
"sternly admonished" the group for failing to file a timely class action
request in a 1982 employment discrimination case.
   According to the memorandum, the judge allowed the committee to file the
request late. But he warned them not to let it happen again.
   "Plaintiffs chose to bring this as a class action and it is time for
them to fish or cut bait," the judge said.

MUSICAL CHAIRS AT OCC; NEW AIDE FOR BEREUTER, HEAVYWEIGHTS AT N.Y. FED

Mark P. Jacobsen was named senior adviser to Comptroller of the
Currency Eugene A. Ludwig last week. After joining the agency in January
1994, Mr. Jacobsen was special assistant to the chief counsel. Before that
he had
been an associate with the law firm of Covington & Burling, where Mr.
Ludwig was a partner.
   Mr. Jacobsen replaces Ballard Gilmore, who is now director of licensing
operations in the agency's bank organization department.
   Meanwhile, John Hartzell has left his post as deputy comptroller for
international banking for, of all things, an international bank.
   Mr. Hartzell, who left last month, will soon join the New York office of
Dresdner Bank, which is based in Frankfurt. His new title will be director
of economic and group strategy. The Comptroller's office has not chosen a
replacement.
                              ***
   Rep. Doug Bereuter, R-Neb., has hired Alan Brubaker as his new banking
aide. Mr. Brubaker, 28, most recently worked as a loan officer with a
Maryland mortgage company, but has Capitol Hill experience. From 1989 to
1991 he was a staff member with the House Republican Conference.
   Rep. Bereuter is sponsor of the House's regulatory-relief bill, which
would cut bank paperwork and red tape. The legislation is stalled because
of banks' opposition to restrictions on their insurance powers.
   Mr. Brubaker replaces Joe Pigg, who left in October to be a Washington
lobbyist for New York City.
                              ***
   Investment banker John C. Whitehead, insurance executive Thomas W.
Jones, and balanced-budget crusader Peter G. Peterson have been named to
the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
   Mr. Whitehead, a former State Department deputy secretary and former co-
chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Co., now heads AEA Investors Inc. He will be
chairman of the New York Fed board.
   Tapped as deputy chairman was Mr. Jones, who is vice chairman,
president, and chief operating officer of Teachers Insurance and Annuity
Association-College Retirement Equities Fund.
   Mr. Peterson is a former secretary of commerce and former CEO of Lehman
Brothers, Kuhn, Loeb Inc. He now heads the Blackstone Group, an investment
firm, but is perhaps best known for founding the Concord Coalition, a
nonprofit group pushing for a balanced federal budget.
   The Federal Reserve Board appointed the three men; the other six members
of the New York Fed board are elected by Fed member banks.
                              ***
   Gail L. Patelunas is the new acting director of the division of
resolutions at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. She takes the place
vacated by Robert H. Hartheimer, who resigned as of Dec. 31 to join the
Alexandria, Va., investment banking firm of Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &
Co.
   Since 1994, Ms. Patelunas has been associate director of the division,
which is responsible for the resolution of failing FDIC-insured banks and
thrifts. Before that she was assistant director of resolutions, and before
joining the FDIC in 1990 she worked at the Federal Reserve Board, Kidder,
Peabody & Co., and KPMG Peat Marwick.
                              ***
   Lynn Reaser is the new chairman of the American Bankers Association's

ROYAL BANK OF CANADA TRIMS U.S. OPERATIONS TO ZERO IN ON PROFITS

By DANIEL DUNAIEF
Less is more for the U.S. businesses of Canada's biggest bank,  Royal
Bank of Canada.
   In the last three years, U.S. senior vice president and general manager
David L. Robertson has reduced the bank's corporate client base to about
685 from 1,500.
   At the same time, he has reduced the bank's staff to 217 from 415, even
as the bank has added an asset-backed securities business, a syndication
distribution business, and a structured finance team.
   And Mr. Robertson is not done. He plans to reduce the number of
corporate clients even further in 1996, to 600, focusing on multinational
companies that present the greatest opportunities for the bank.
   In conjunction with its investment banking affiliate Dominion
Securities, Royal Bank has been building its expertise in various capital
markets arenas, hoping to develop a critical mass of business to justify
doing business with each customer.
   "We want to be able to deliver at least three or four main products to
each of our clients," said the 53-year-old Mr. Robertson.
   The bank also hopes to find companies that have subsidiaries in Canada,
where it can provide a branch network and services ranging from payroll to
cash management.
   The strategy has worked so far, with fewer customers accounting for more
revenues.
   Mr. Robertson estimated that revenues from U.S.-based banking had
reached 10% to 12% of gross revenues, up from about 8% three years ago when
he took over the U.S. operations.
   Some of that increased profitability can be attributed to  growth in
specific business lines.
   "We've more than trebled the amount of foreign exchange and capital
markets derivatives that we deliver to the remaining clients," said Mr.
Robertson.
   The key products Royal Bank is looking to deliver include trade finance,
syndicated loans and standby lines of credit, foreign exchange, capital
markets derivatives, and equity derivatives.
   To that end, Dominion Securities last year added 20 former Kidder
Peabody equity derivatives traders to its staff.
   Additionally, this fall the bank raised its profile among U.S. investors
by listing its stock on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Mr. Robertson said the listing was "a first step," as the bank continues
to view the United States as an area for expansion in such areas as retail
banking, fund management, and regional investment banking.
   While the New York Stock Exchange listing presents an opportunity for an
acquisition, it's not something the bank considers practical right now.
"You see what everyone wants to pay to buy banks these days?" Mr. Robertson
asked.
   Down the road, Mr. Robertson said, the United States presents an ideal
area for expansion, especially as laws like the Depression-era Glass-
Steagall Act and the Bank Holding Company Act change.
   "If you look at North America and at the North American Free Trade
Agreement, (a strategic acquisition) would be a natural expansion for us,"
he said.
   The Royal Bank executive said that a focused strategy is the right
approach in a foreign marketplace.
   Indeed, Mr. Robertson, who has been with the bank for 36 years, has done
three stints outside Canada, including one in London, and articulated the
need for targeted competition.
   "You can't compete with Natwest or Barclays on the ground in England and
really make any money," said Mr. Robertson. "When you're outside the
country, you have to try to deliver certain things you can do profitably."
   The Royal Bank favors profitability over size.
   With about a $6 billion-asset base in the United States, the bank has
the smallest amount of American assets among Canadian banks.
   "We're not chasing assets," said Mr. Robertson. "We concentrate on
products, and if it results in assets, that's fine."

CONSUMER DELINQUENCY SPURRING SHORT SALES

By JAMES C. ALLEN and STEPHEN KLEEGE
Sharp divisions are developing on Wall Street over the recent upticks
in consumer loan delinquencies.
   Short-sellers are betting on further damage to consumer finance
companies, while some stock analysts are touting buying opportunities in
the stocks.
   A case in point is Olympic Financial Ltd., a Minneapolis-based auto
lender that won a "buy" affirmation from Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette last
week - after the short interest in its shares had soared 65% in a month.
   The skepticism about consumer lenders helped push up short interest in
bank-related shares traded on the National Association of Securities
Dealers' system by 9.5% in the month ended Dec. 15. The rise in bank short
interest came amid a general decline in short interest in stocks traded on
the over-the-counter system. (See tables on pages 22 and 24.)
   Short interest is the outstanding volume of shares sold short - that is,
borrowed and promptly sold. Short-sellers are betting that the stock price
will fall, so their short positions can be covered profitably with cheaper
shares.
   Earlier, the New York Stock Exchange and American Stock Exchange
reported a slight decline in bank-related short interest. The basket of
bank stocks traded on the Nasdaq includes numerous small, retail-oriented
banks and thrifts that could be seen as vulnerable to rising delinquencies.
   Short interest in Olympic Financial - which provides auto finance mostly
to "prime," or creditworthy, consumers - rose by nearly 1.8 million shares,
to more than 4.6 million shares. It was the largest short position in the
bank-related group.
   RCSB Financial, a Rochester, N.Y., thrift holding company, had the
largest short position relative to its daily trading volume. Its short
position of 2.3 million shares represents 21.1 days of average trading.
   RCSB had the fourth-largest short position in total among the Nasdaq
bank-related issues, behind Olympic and Boatmen's Bancshares, the St. Louis
based regional bank, with 2.7 million shares sold short.
   The second-biggest increase was in the Money Store, the well-known home
equity lender. The Money Store's short position increased by 848,852 shares
to 1.5 million shares - the 10th-largest total.
   Olympic Financial's shares were trading at $16 last week, off from more
than $30 in September. Short-sellers apparently believe Olympic could fall
even further because of what analyst Andrew Jeffrey of Rodman & Renshaw
calls its "loss deferral strategy."
   "I think the assumptions they have used are unrealistic, given the type
of paper they are buying," said Mr. Jeffrey, who specializes in companies
that make auto loans to less creditworthy consumers.
   Olympic's chairman and chief executive Jeffrey Mack insists the
company's loss assumptions are based on historical performance: Loan losses
are currently running at an annualized rate of 65 to 75 basis points, or
130 basis points to 140 basis points over the average two-year life of a
loan, he said.
   He said the company is setting aside nearly 172 basis points to cover
any variance that economic swings cause for the portfolio.
   "On top of that, we have set up what we call general reserves, which are
other allocated reserves in the millions of dollars, to add further
protection," he said.
   But that is not enough, Mr. Jeffrey said. He said General Motors
Acceptance Corp., also a prime lender, has experienced cumulative losses of
200 basis points during previous economic downturns.
   Another disconcerting factor for Mr. Jeffrey is the manner in which
Olympic disposes of its repossessed automobiles. Instead of auctioning the
autos as its competitors do, Olympic puts the cars on a used-car lot and
sells them on consignment, he said.
   By doing so, he said the company is increasing its future losses because
it is making greater concessions in order to get the asset sold.
   But some observers said the pessimists are misguided.
   Thomas Brown, a banking analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said
that short-sellers tend to be paranoid and that they are "wrong in assuming
this is a giant conspiracy."
   The rating agencies, third-party guarantors, and Olympic's accountants
have all signed off on the company's assumptions regarding such things as
prepayment speeds and loan-loss reserves, Mr. Brown said.
   "In my experience it's typical of the way short-sellers have tried to
jump on financial stocks," he said. "It makes a good story until you
examine it."
   Mr. Brown said even if losses exceed the level of reserves the company
has set aside, it is unlikely that shareholders will see a significant
reduction in current earnings to cover any losses.
   If he's right, a lot of short-sellers will be licking their wounds next
year.

STOCK OF SYSTEMS, PROCESSING FIRMS JUMPED 34% IN '96

By BRIAN TRACEY
Like in the rest of the U.S. equities market, 1995 was a terrific year
for bank technology stocks.
   The publicly traded financial systems and processing-services firms
tracked by American Banker saw their stock prices rise an average of 34%
last year.
   That hefty increase was statistically in line with the Standard & Poor's
index of 500 stocks and the Dow Jones industrial average, which both rose
by about one-third in 1995.
   But what was even more interesting was that only 6 of the 30 listed
financial systems stocks lost value over the 12-month period, while 13
outperformed the average gain. The number of advancing stocks far exceeded
1994 performance levels, when just 13 out of 28 firms experienced gains.
   Wall Street analysts said the bull market in 1995 was led mainly by the
technology sector, as more consumers and companies sought to leverage the
latest advances in computer and telecommunications systems.
   Banks and their technology vendors seem to be at the nexus of this
trend, observers said. Financial institutions increasingly see technology
as vital to their future competitive positioning, as well as providing the
means to link up with their most profitable customers.
   Payment systems and information processing firms are "the growth stocks
of the next century," said Richard K. Weingarten, an analyst at Montgomery
Securities in San Francisco. "They're the new Cokes and Pepsis and
Gillettes of the world."
   Like 1994, payment services and financial application software companies
offered the best returns on investment. Leading the pack was bank software
developer Jack Henry & Associates, which saw its stock appreciate a
whopping 156% in 1995.
   Kevin J. Dyches, an analyst with George K. Baum & Co. in Kansas City,
said Jack Henry's big gain was mainly attributable to the company's June
acquisition of the community banking software business of Broadway &
Seymour Inc.
   "Through that acquisition, Jack Henry increased their customer base by
33%," Mr. Dyches said. "At that time, their market value was about $150
million, and they bought a company that was one-third their size for $12
million." He also noted that the acquisition was profitable in the first
quarter after Monett, Mo.-based Jack Henry acquired the business.
   Mr. Dyches added that Jack Henry was generating internal revenue growth
through sales of its Silverlake core accounting system, designed for
midsize banks with between $100 million and $10 billion in assets.
   The second-biggest percentage gain among financial systems firms was
Concord EFS Inc., a provider of payments systems services to retailers.
Then Memphis-based firm's stock rose 146% during 1995.
   Two years ago, Concord's stock dipped after some weak-performing
quarters, but since then "they've gained back the confidence of the
market," Mr. Weingarten said. "They had the strongest internal growth of
any company in the payment services group."
   He added that Concord's specialty is provident credit and debit point of
sale systems to supermarkets, "which is the fastest growing part of the
payments processing business."
   Hogan Systems Inc., another bank software firm, gave its stockholders a
tidy profit for the year: its common stock rose 110%. After months of
speculation, Dallas-based Hogan agreed last month to be acquired by
Continuum Co., an Austin, Tex.-based developer of systems for the insurance
industry, in stock swap currently valued at about $200 million.
   It's also interesting to note that two of the best-performing stocks in
1994, Charlotte, N.C.-based Broadway & Seymour and San Rafael, Calif.-based
Fair, Isaac & Co. lost ground in 1995.
   The common stock value of Fair, Isaac, a developer of credit scoring
systems, dropped 9%. for the year.
   Broadway & Seymour, after peaking at $31 a share last summer, has
skidded back to about $16 a share after the company announced it would take
a fourth-quarter restructuring charge.

DELUXE WILL TAKE RESTRUCTURING CHARGE OF $60M TO $70M

By BRIAN TRACEY
Check printing firm Deluxe Corp., acknowledging that its future success
lies more in electronic banking, said last week it would take $60 million
to $70 million restructuring charge.
   Executives at St. Paul-based Deluxe said last week that the fourth-
quarter charge to earnings would cover expenses related to the closing of
several check printing facilities and other writeoffs in several business
units.
   The company has seen its profit margins shrink in its core check
printing business in recent years as the banking industry has consolidated.
In addition, electronic payments are expected to slowly begin replacing
paper checks as consumers increasingly use bank cards.
   "Our earnings declines over the last three years have clearly been a
disappointment to our shareholders and employees, and it is now time to
begin reversing that trend," said J. A. "Gus" Blanchard, Deluxe's president
and chief executive officer, who added that the restructuring should
generate $100 million to $125 million in annual expense savings by the end
of 1997.
   Mr. Blanchard said that as part of its new strategy, the company plans
to enhance its electronic banking and other types of information services
for financial institutions, mainly through its Deluxe Data unit, a leading
third-party processor of automated teller machine transactions.
   "Through our Deluxe Data subsidiary, we already provide a variety of
transaction processing and settlement capabilities as well as applications
for linking various back-office functions," Mr. Blanchard  said. "Our new
plan calls for strengthening our existing offerings as well as broadening
our total value proposition, with the objective being to permit our client
financial institutions to connect their customers to any banking
application ... by whatever electronic means the customer chooses."
   Deluxe officials also said they plan to beef up their product offerings
in the payment protection arena, as banks have been forced to eat billions
of dollars in fraudulent transactions in recent years.
